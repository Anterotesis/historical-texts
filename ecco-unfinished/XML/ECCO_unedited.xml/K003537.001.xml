take this Opportunity to

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>VSTOM is the only
Occasion of giving the

Translation so long, when they
must be certainly allowed by all
Judicious Readers to be the most
admired Part of her Works.
Her Novels and Tales, that
were published some Years ago,
are well worthy Esteem; but
these seem far more correct, and
the Tales so happily interwoven
with the Novels, show her Judg∣ment
more refined and stronger
than in the former.</P>
<P>I shall not pretend to say any
thing in Commendation of the
Translators, only that they have
kept up to the Sense and Spirit
of the Author, whose Thoughts
are so elegant and refined, their

in a Paraphrase: And if the
Gentleman that lately gave us a
Piece in <HI>English</HI> of this incom∣parable

nearer the Original, he would
have better succeeded; for no

<HEAD>THE
TALES
OF THE
FAIRIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the Rigours of a long and se∣vere
Winter were over, and the fine
Weather invited People abroad, Ma∣dam
<HI>d'Anois</HI> took a Walk with some
Gentlemen and Ladies of Wit and
Distinction to <HI>St. Clou;</HI> where she be∣ing
the first of that illustrious Company that was
tired, sat her self down by a Fountain's side. “Leave
me here, <HI>said she,</HI> it may be some Savage or Dryade
will come and entertain me.” Every one made
their particular Reflection on her Laziness; but
their Impatience to see the many beautiful Objects
that there presented themselves, over-balancing the
Desire they might otherwise have had to stay with
her, Mr. <HI>de St.</HI>—told her, “That as the Con∣versation
she expected from the Inhabitants of that
Wood were somewhat uncertain; he would lend
her some Fairy Stories that would divert her very
agreeably.” “They must be none of my own
writing then, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> d'Anois; but make
no scruple to leave me here, I shall not be idle.”</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="11"/>
Madam <HI>d' Anois</HI> persisted so long in these Sollici∣tations,
that the Company left her, and after ha∣ving
walk'd all about, return'd to that shaded
Alley where she waited for them. “What a sight
have you lost? <HI>cry'd the Countess</HI> de—, <HI>accost∣ing
her:</HI> What we have seen, is wonderful.” “And
what has happen'd to me, <HI>answer'd the other,</HI> is no
less: Casting my Eyes about to distinguish the
different Objects which I admir'd, I suddenly per∣ceiv'd
a Nymph by me, whose bright Eyes, lively
Air, and genteel Behaviour gave me as much Satis∣faction,
as they caus'd Surprize in me: A loose
Garment that she wore discover'd the just Pro∣portion
of her Shape; the Plaitings of her Hair
were tied down to her Waste by a bunch of Rib∣bons,
and the Exactness of her Features was alto∣gether
pleasing; and I was going to speak to her,
when she interrupted me by Verses which she re∣peated
in favour of this Abode. On the noise
of your Approach she seem'd uneasy, and said to
me, Farewell, I thought you had been alone, but
since you have Company, I'll see you again ano∣ther
time. After these Words she disappear'd,
and I must confess I was glad to see you, for I
began to be in some fear.” “You are too happy,
<HI>said the Marquiss</HI> de—, to have so agreeable
a Correspondence, sometimes with the Muses, and
sometimes with Fairies, you cannot be weary of
it; if I was as knowing in these kind of Stories,
I should have a very good Opinion of my self.”
“They are Gifts, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> d'Anois, wherewith
we generally want a great many other necessary
Things; hitherto, my good Friends the Fairies
have not been very prodigal of their Favours to
me, therefore I can assure you, that I resolve to
have as little Value for them as they have for me.”
“Ah! Madam, <HI>interrupted the Countess,</HI> I ask you
pardon on that score, you owe us a Relation of some
of their Adventures, here is a convenient Place for
you to acquir your self of that Obligation; you
shall have no reason to say you ever was listen'd
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
to with more Attention.” “You see, <HI>said Madam</HI>
d'Anois, that I foresaw what you would probably
request; since I have a Story here ready for you
to read: to render which the more agreeable, I
have join'd to it a <HI>Spanish</HI> Novel, which I know
to be a very true one.”</P>

<HEAD>The Story of Don GABRIEL.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ON <HI>Felix Sarmiento</HI> was a Gentleman, both
of Quality and Merit, in the Province of
<HI>Gallicia,</HI> where he married Donna <HI>Henrica
de Palacios,</HI> of a Family no way inferiour
to his. By this Marriage he had a very handsome
and accomplish'd Gentleman for his Son, call'd,
Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> and two Daughters, who for Wit and
Beauty were not to be equall'd in all that Province.</P>
<P>Their Mother, who was a Lady distinguish'd for
her Virtue and Worth, being surpriz'd with a sud∣den
and violent Disease at one of her Country-Seats,
had only time to send for her Sister-in-Law,
to leave her Daughters to her Care. “Dear Sister,
<HI>said she, when she was come,</HI> since there cannot
be any Deposit more dear to me than this I en∣trust
you with, promise me that my Daughters
shall find in you what they are going to lose in
me: Love <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> both for my sake
and their own, and cultivate their Dispositions,
which are excellent. I promis'd my self to neg∣lect
nothing in their Education, but alas! we
must be separated.” Here she was interrupted by
those two lovely Creatures, each on her Knees
by the Bed-side, holding her Mother's Hand, kis∣sing
and bathing it with Tears, with so much Love
and Respect, as shew'd they were not to be parted.
“What, my dear Children, <HI>said she to them,</HI> do you
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
endeavour to stay me? It seems as if you would
make me regret a Life I am going to surrender
to the Will of the Divine Providence: instead of
dispiriting me, rather encourage me.” “Sister,
<HI>continu'd she, addressing herself to Donna</HI> Juana, I beg
of you not to bring them too soon on the Stage
of this World, which abounds in such dangerous
Charms and Temptations, so much to be dreaded,
that they stand in need of a great share of Sense
and Prudence, both to know and resist them.”</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was an old Maid, and more
severe than all the Duegna's of <HI>Spain</HI> put together,
was overjoy'd at these last Words of her Sister-in-Law,
and without returning any Answer to the
tender Expressions she had used, cry'd out, “I as∣sure
you, your Daughters shall not have the li∣berty
to see the Sun; I will keep them so close
up, that the World shall not know there are any
such Persons living: and since you have given
me the Charge of them, I will be a thousand times
more rigorous than you yourself would have
been.” The Weakness of the sick Lady hinder'd
her from answering, and moderating these so hard
Resolves; and for the young Ladies, they were too
much griev'd to hear what their Aunt said. After
having perform'd their last Devoirs, Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
carry'd them to another Country-Seat of their Fa∣ther's,
near <HI>Compostella,</HI> who had at that time a
Command in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he heard of his Wife's
Death, and her Disposal of his two Daughters. He
appear'd as much afflicted for the one, as dissatis∣fy'd
with the other: for he knew his Sister's Cha∣racter,
that she was of a violent, inslexible, and
mistrustful Temper, and foresaw that his Daughters
would find a great difference between the Govern∣ment
of their Mother and that of their Aunt. But
considering that he was at a distance, and his
Daughters were very young and handsome, and
that it was better than putting them into a Con∣vent;
he at last determin'd to let them be with
their Aunt Donna <HI>Juana.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
When their Brother, who was then at <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
heard of his Mother's Death, he took Post to go
to condole with his Sisters; and being a pretty
Gentleman, as I said before, his Presence conduc'd
very much to the mitigating their Grief. When∣ever
they could have any private Discourse, for he
was in a strict Union with them, they complain'd
to him, that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was ill-natur'd, and
never to be pleas'd, that they never went abroad;
nor were permitted to see any Company; that she
was always grumbling at them, and that they had
cause to be sensible of their Loss. “Indeed, <HI>said
Don</HI> Lewis, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> is a Woman of Merit and
Virtue; but that Virtue is very unsociable: for
as she is neither handsome nor young, and never
was capable of inspiring any Tenderness, she can∣not
allow any little innocent Liberty before her.
I am afraid that at last she will be jealous of the
Day that Lights you, since she has already told
me she'll let you stir out but very seldom, and
that when she cannot dispense with it; which will
be with such Precautions, that it will be im∣possible
to see you.” “I can assure you, Brother,
<HI>said</HI> Isidora, she may follow her own Caprice, as
to that Point, without my opposing her; since
nothing hitherto has induc'd me to desire any
Commerce with the World which she is so very
much afraid of, provided she uses me kindly.”
“I shall be well satisfy'd, for my part, <HI>added</HI> Me∣lanthia;
I have not yet seen any thing amiable
enough to make me regret my being thus de∣barr'd
the sight of Company.” Don <HI>Lewis</HI> comfort∣ed
them the best he could, and brought them
Books to divert them; and after a Month's abode
with them, return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> whither his Business
and Pleasures call'd him.</P>
<P>He had several Friends there, who were sensible
of his Absence and desirous of his Return; among
whom, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> were
the chief: they sent every day to his Lodgings,
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
and as soon as he arriv'd, went to see him. Their
first Conversation was somewhat melancholy, be∣cause
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> related his Mother's Death; but
speaking afterwards of his Sisters, he told them how
severely his Aunt kept them, that they began to be
weary, and twas pity two such pretty Creatures
should be so ill us'd: in short, he inlarged on
their Merit more like a Lover than a Brother.
Don <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>briel</HI> seem'd to take little notice of Don
<HI>Lewis</HI>'s Discourse, but speaking suddenly of some∣thing
else, said, “I am surpriz'd you have ask'd
no News of the beautiful <HI>Lucilla.</HI>” “You cannot
believe, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Lewis, that it proceeds
from any Indifference; my Sentiments are too
lively and too well grounded to change: but I
thought I ought to begin our Conversation by
informing you of the State of our Family.” “<HI>Lu∣cilla</HI>
lost her Brother by a very dismal Accident,
and is gone to <HI>Sevil</HI> to administer to his Estate,
<HI>said the Count</HI> d'Aguilar, from whence I believe
she will not return very speedily.” “Since she is
not here, <HI>continu'd Don</HI> Lewis, I shall not stay long
with you, I must go to-morrow.” “What a vio∣lent
haste you are in? <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel: do you
think there is nothing due from you to us? But
tho the Tie may not be so great, yet 'tis injustice
in you to bestow all on one.” “Your Rights in my
Heart are not to be disputed, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Lewis
<HI>smiling,</HI> but you know a Mistress and a Friend
are two different Things, since the Sentiments
we have for each interfere not with one another.”
“Oh! <HI>said Count</HI> d'Aguilar <HI>laughing,</HI> you love us very
well, but you are going to leave us to-morrow
for <HI>Lucilla;</HI> indeed, the Rights we have in your
Heart are too much limited, and hers too much
enlarg'd: but cannot you, without offending that
fair Lady, stay here till she returns?” “No, Sir,
I cannot, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Lewis, without giving her
some Chagrin, and that I would not do for all
the World: Friendship is more reasonable than
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
Love, and gives greater Liberties; I can leave
you without gaining your Displeasure, and I am
sure I shall always find you the same when I re∣turn.”
“Oh! how happy am I, <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
to enjoy my Liberty, to be, in respect of the Fair
Sex, like a Butterfly in a Meadow of fine Flow∣ers,
able to fly over them, and never fix on one.”
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> sigh'd at these words, either because he
was not so much at ease as his Friend, or because
he was not at the feet of the Disturber of his Re∣pose.</P>
<P>They parted with a thousand Protestations of
Friendship; Don <HI>Lewis</HI> went to <HI>Sevil,</HI> as he had
determined, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count <HI>d'Agui∣lar,</HI>
who lodged together, and were intimate Friends,
staid at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> became so thought∣ful,
spoke so little, and return'd such distracted
Answers, that his Cousin, who never observed him
in that Condition before, was several times going to
ask him the Cause: but thinking that he might have
some secret Engagement upon his hand, and that
pressing him hard might make him uneasy, he re∣solved
to take other measures; accordingly he set
one of his Servants, a cunning Fellow, to watch
where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> went, and to give him an ac∣count
of his Behaviour. After this <HI>Aguilar,</HI> who
depended on hearing some News of his Cousin, pre∣tended
to have some urgent Business, and went
out, to give him the more liberty; but at night his
Valet had no other News to tell him, but that he
took a Walk in a lonesome Garden by the Sea-side,
and the rest of the day shut himself up in his Clo∣set,
and spoke to nobody. This Conduct surprized
the Count, who after having waited three Weeks,
in hopes this Fit would go off, at last broke the Ice
himself; telling him, That he had of late observed
in his Carriage something so different from his usual
Proceeding, that he could no longer forbear speaking
of it; and that if he had no ground for his Melancho∣ly,
he ought to prevent that Disease's getting too great
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
an head; offering him at the same time, if he had
any Change in his Fortune, part of his; and at last
told his freely, that he ought not to hide any thing
from him, since he had made both tryal of his
Friendship and Discretion.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> answer'd him only with a deep Sigh,
and the Count, who observed him with a great deal
of Attention, continuing his Discourse, said, “What
can be the matter with you, you are a very ac∣complish'd
Gentleman, your Birth is so noble,
that it is sufficient to use your Name to create
Respect; your Father has a good Estate, and al∣lows
you very handsomly: in short, you must be
in love, and are unkindly receiv'd.” “Alas! Cou∣sin,
<HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, you are too pressing; can∣not
you love me without asking me Questions?”
“But, <HI>continued he, after some small Silence,</HI> I abuse
your Goodness, and am very sensible nothing is
more engaging than what you have said to me;
if I have kept my Secret from you, it was purely
out of the Desire I had to preserve your Esteem:
Alas! you can have none for me, after I shall con∣fess
my Extravagance to you. I am in love, I own,
and the Passion is the more dangerous, since I
know not whether the Person, that is the Cause
of all my Disquiet, merits what I endure for her.
'Tis <HI>Isidora,</HI> Don <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Sister, whom I have never
seen, nor perhaps ever shall, since her Aunt is
jealous of the very Sun that shines on her, and
gives her not the least liberty.”</P>
<P>The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> listen'd to his Cousin with
great Astonishment, and said to him, “Had you ever
seen <HI>Isidora,</HI> and loved her, your speaking after
this manner would not have surprized me so much;
but 'tis very odd, that after the long time you have
lived in <HI>Madrid,</HI> and your Travels into <HI>Italy, France,</HI>
and <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anders,</HI> where you have seen very beautiful
Ladies, without having any Inclination for any of
them, you should at last run aground all on a sud∣den,
and surrender without being acquainted ei∣ther
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
with the Beauty, Wit, or Humour of her you
have thought of loving.” “For this reason I was
ashamed and vexed, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, and durst
not make my Secret known to you; and in the
height of my Misfortune, knew no other Remedy
but that of resisting my Passion.” “Oh dear Friend!
<HI>said the Count,</HI> trust not to that; I see your time is
come, you are a Rebel that thought yourself in∣sensible,
and Love has a mind to punish you, by
creating a Tenderness in you for what you have
never seen.” “I beg of you not to banter me, <HI>an∣swer'd
Don</HI> Gabriel, for I never had less Inclination
to laugh in all my Life; if you will not talk of
this Affair more seriously, I'd rather we left off
the Discourse.”</P>
<P>The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> told him, That <HI>Isidora</HI> was
neither an Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor a Sovereign Prin∣cess,
and that, in all appearance, if he demanded
her, she would not be refused; which pleased him
mightily: “I believe so, as well as you, <HI>answer'd
Don</HI> Gabriel; but I have another Chimera come
in my Head, as difficult to strive with as my
Passion; that is, if my Services should not be a∣greeable
to her, if she should not love me at first,
if I owe the Possession of her to either her Obe∣dience
to her Relations, or my Quality and Estate,
and not to her Tenderness, I shall never be satis∣fied.”
“All this seems to me very singular, <HI>said
Aguilar;</HI> I pity you, and am sorry to see you in
such Torments, without being in a Condition to
ease them: but if what I have told you all my
Life, that I am entirely yours, and if you can
imagine any way how I may be serviceable,
you may depend on me.” At these words, Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> embraced his Cousin, and said to him, “Re∣member
you keep your word, for in a little time
I may have occasion to try you.”</P>
<P>It was late when they parted, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>
thought himself less unhappy, since he had found
a Confidant, and the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt was overjoy'd to know
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
what was the matter with his Friend, that he might
either oppose or flatter his Passion, as he judged
most proper. After this first Confession, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>
made no difficulty to declare his Thoughts to <HI>Agui∣lar,</HI>
but sought him out as an Ease to his Pains, and
was overjoy'd not to find him of a contradictory
Temper, it being displeasing always to meet with
continual Remonstrances.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was willing to wait some time, to
see if his Reason would not remedy the Disorders
of his Heart; but perceiving that the more re∣sistance
he made, the weaker he grew, and that the
Idea he had form'd of <HI>Isidora</HI> still persecuted him,
he resolved to endeavour to see her, and going in∣to
the Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI>'s Chamber at Day-break, said
to him, “Dear Cousin, I must go to <HI>Gallicia.</HI>” “I
understand you, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> in search after
<HI>Isidora;</HI> but how do you think to come at what
you desire?” “I think, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
when we come there, to set the House on fire,
and by the means of that Disorder to get into her
Chamber, and carry her away in my Arms.” “In∣deed
Don <HI>Gabriel, said the Count,</HI> you are not pru∣dent
to begin by a Fire, that will be so prejudicial
to one or your best Friends: consider first, that
you will do don <HI>Lewis</HI> a great injury, by burning
his House, which is one of the finest in that Pro∣vince;
and then, that your dear <HI>Isidora</HI> may be
stifled by the Smoke or Flames, and perhaps you
may both perish: therefore I think this is the
most dangerous Expedient you could have thought
of.” “I design'd, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, to have ta∣ken
the Estate as a Part of her Fortune, and so
have done Don <HI>Lewis</HI> no wrong; but since you
seem so a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erse to this Proposal, I will decline it,
provided you find out a better, that nothing may
retard our Journey.” “My Opinion is, <HI>said the
Count,</HI> to take Post to the nighest Town to the
House, and to carry with us some Pilgrims Habits
to disguise ourselves, that we may not be known,
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
lest we should be surprized on the Road to <HI>Com∣postella,</HI>
where People stay sometimes some Hours.”
“Some Hours! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, how do you think
I can manage my Affairs in that time?” “Oh I
have thought of an admirable way, <HI>said the Count
laughing;</HI> and that is, You shall feign yourself
dead, and then nobody will press you to be gone.”
“I know very well, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, (who could
not bear a Jest as he was used) that you turn e∣very
thing into Ridicule, and for that reason I'll
hold my tongue.”</P>
<P>The Count perceived, but a little too late, That
Joking was not always seasonable; and reflecting
that 'twas better to sacrifice a good Jest to his
Friend, than his Friend for a Jest, he desired his
Cousin to pardon that Sally: “But to return to our
Business in hand, <HI>continued he,</HI> I fancy it would not
be amiss for one of us to pretend to be wounded,
perhaps the old Aunt may have more Charity for
Pilgrims than other Folks, and will take care of
us.” Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> approved of this Thought, and
lost not a moment's time to give the necessary Or∣ders
for the Habits, and set out with his Cousin two
days afterwards. For the Count <HI>d'Aguilar,</HI> he was
no way inferiour to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> either in his Shape
or Mien; they had both a noble Air, and were Men
of as much Wit and Politeness as any in <HI>Spain.</HI>
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had a most delicate Voice, and the
Count plaid on the Harp and Guittar as well as
the best Master: They had learnt to ride the great
Horse and dance in <HI>France,</HI> and understood several
Languages as well as their own; in short, they
were two well-accomplish'd Gentlemen. And such
as I have here represented them, they went to Don∣na
<HI>Juana</HI>'s with their Hair put under their great
Hats, cover'd all over with Shells, for they had
left their Pilgrim's-Staff, their Calebasses, and all
their other Equipage that they used in this their
Disguise, with a Servant at <HI>Ciudad-Rodrigo,</HI> a Village
hard by: and that they might arrive there in the
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
Evening, to be the more easily receiv'd, they went
into a Wood, the Avenues of which served for
Walks to the Castle, and were parted by little
Brooks, which freshen'd the Grass, and made it al∣ways
green; where the Trees, which had stood
there time out of mind, and were Sancturies for
the Birds, by their Boughs mixing one within ano∣ther,
form'd most pleasant Shades.</P>
<P>“What a sweet Abode is here? <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel
<HI>to the Count;</HI> how happy should I be, if I could
live here with the Person whom I adore? But
this flattering Thought carries me too far, when
I consider I have not yet any Pretence for my Pas∣sion,
and may have less in the end.” “You must
not despair of your good Success, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI>
if it was not for that Caprice of yours, of being
beloved before you are known, 'tis certain your
Name would overcome the greatest Difficulties,
and it would not be long before you might be hap∣py.”
What would you have me to do? <HI>reply'd Don</HI>
Gabriel; I cannot help it, I must make some im∣pressions
on <HI>Isidora</HI>'s Heart, before she knows who
I am.” 'The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> was ready to die with
laughing, but conceal'd it; and continuing their
Walk, they came to a little Box, some little distance
from the Castle, on that side of the Park that join'd
to the Wood. All was silent, and our Pilgrims
approach'd without any Noise, and placing them∣selves
under the Windows, which were open, they
heard some Persons talking, but could not under∣stand
what they said; when they had made an end
of their Discourse, one of the Ladies, raising her
Voice, said, “I have a great deal more to say on
this Subject, if my Aunt was not alone; but she is
too great a Lover of Romances to deprive me of
the Pleasure of hearing them.” Hereupon they
got up and went away, when Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had
a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esire to have detain'd those Ladies, and
enter'd into a Discourse with them, said to the
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
Count <HI>d' Aguilar,</HI> “I'll sing some amorous Complaint,
it may be my Voice may bring us acquainted.”</P>
<P>“You have forgot, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> that one of
us was to feign being wounded, and this manner
of complaining and asking Assistance will be very
novel.” “That's true, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, but I can
always excite a Curiosity sooner by a Song, than
by Groans; but, <HI>continued he,</HI> I ought to follow our
first Project, for if my Designs had not their de∣sired
Success, I should have blam'd myself.” “That
we may do every thing to the best advantage, <HI>said
the Count,</HI> I'll be the wounded Person, and you
shall be the <HI>Orpheus;</HI> therefore begin, perhaps our
Matters may succeed better than we dare hope
for.” Whereupon Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> bethought himself
of the most moving Air and tender Words, and rai∣sing
his Voice a little, the Echoes seem'd to hesi∣tate
whether they should return any Answer; the
Nightingales listen'd, and the Zephirs held their
Breath; and for the Count <HI>d' Aguilar,</HI> he was amazed,
his Cousin's Voice was so much embelish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Isidora, Melanthia,</HI> and a young Lady of Fashion,
named <HI>Rosa,</HI> were just then walking softly towards
the Castle; but as soon as they heard that Voice,
which they thought was wonderful fine, they ran
to the Windows of the little Box with so much pre∣cipitation,
that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count made no
dispute but that they came to hear them; and you
may naturally suppose our Lover neglected nothing
whereby he could charm those Ladies: but as he
was often saying to his Cousin, “I shall regret very
much the pains I take, if <HI>Isidora</HI> is not there;”
they were suddenly surprized by a Consort, play'd
by <HI>Isidora</HI> on the Harp, <HI>Melanthia</HI> on the Guittar,
and <HI>Rosa</HI> on the Viol. The Room appear'd full of
Lights, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> thought he should almost
die with Joy, flattering himself that he had some
share in that Symphony and those Lights. But not
satisfy'd with hearing, he endeavour'd to find out
a way to gratify his Eyes, on which occasion his
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
Activity was of no small use to him; for by climb∣ing
up into a Tree, he easily observed the Ladies
playing on their Instruments, but was at too great
a distance to discern their Features.</P>
<P>They play'd not long, chusing rather to hear that
Voice which had charm'd them, than their own
Musick; when listening, they heard the Count <HI>d' A∣guilar,</HI>
who began to complain, say, “'Tis impossi∣ble,
Brother, to express what I endure; the Pains
of my Wound increase, and if we are forced to
spend our Night here, I shall be dead before
Morning.” “Alas! what can we do, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ga∣briel,
(speaking loud enough to be heard) unless
we go to this Castle, to beg their Assistance?”
“These are undoubtedly Travellers, <HI>said</HI> Isidora,
who have been wounded by some of the Soldiers
on their March to <HI>Tuy.</HI>” “Ah, Sister, <HI>cry'd</HI> Melan∣thia,
we cannot deny our Charity to Persons, who
may be murder'd in the Night under our Win∣dows;
therefore let us speak to them, to tell them
what they should do.” Hereupon <HI>Isidora,</HI> raising
her Voice a little, said, “You ought to think of
leaving this Wood, for it is oftentimes very dan∣gerous.”
When Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who made all the haste
he could, answer'd, Madam, as we were coming
from <HI>St. Jacques,</HI> we were attack'd by some Rogues,
who have wounded my Brother in his Side, who
notwithstanding has made a shift to walk thus far
a-foot; but finding his Spirits fail him, I have laid
him under one of these Trees, not knowing what
to do with him in so dark a Night.” “Indeed we
pity you, <HI>continued</HI> Isidora, and will do what we
can, that you may be taken into the House till
your Brother is recover'd.” “Heaven reward you,
Madam, <HI>cry'd the Count;</HI> but be pleased to tell us
whom we shall address ourselves to.” “Ask for
the Almoner, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia, he has Orders to
lodge Pilgrims, and we will send you what Assi∣stance
we can; but besure don't say that you have
spoke to us: and if you know any Romances, they
will be acceptable here.”</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24"/>
After these words, they shut their Windows, put
out the Candles, and ran into Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Cham∣ber,
to know how the Pilgrims Affairs went; where
they had not been long, before the Almoner came
to tell her, that two Young-Men, one of whom had
been wounded by some Robbers, desired shelter:
adding, That he never in all his life beheld two
such good Faces, and that if he might judge by their
Persons, they seem'd to be Men of some Birth.
“Are they <HI>Spaniards? said Donna</HI> Juana.” “No, Ma∣dam,
<HI>continu'd the Almoner,</HI> they are <HI>Flemmings.</HI>”
“Ah! <HI>cry'd she,</HI> how fortunate is this! Perhaps they
may have seen my Brother, and can tell me some
News of him; I am very much in pain for him:
Now if they are but well vers'd in Romances, they
shall want for nothing.” “That they boast of, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Almoner.</HI>” “Then let them be brought in
presently, <HI>said Donna</HI> Juana.” “But Madam, <HI>an∣swer'd
the Almoner,</HI> he that is wounded must not be
long out of a Bed.” Well, <HI>said she,</HI> since Works of
“Charity must be perform'd, let him have a Cham∣ber,
and we will wait of him at Table.” For this
was a Principle of Devotion in Donna <HI>Juana.</HI></P>
<P>The Almoner, who had already some Affection
for these Pilgrims, return'd and conducted them in∣to
a very handsome Apartment, which was that
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> lay in, when there, and order'd a good
Supper for them; withal telling them, That Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> and her Neices had so much Compassion on
them, that they design'd to come and wait on them.
When he left them, the Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> said to his
Cousin, “You see, dear Brother, (for so I must call
you now) we have got into this inaccessible Castle
which you despair'd so much of; and from such a
successful Beginning, we may presage your Designs
may prosper.” “Alas! dear Friend, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ga∣briel,
I dare not abandon myself to such flattering
Omens: you know a Man in love is always full
of Fears and Distrusts.” “You ought, instead of
tormenting yourself, to be merry and chearful,
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
<HI>added the Count;</HI> for what can be more pleasant,
than to have such lovely Creatures wait on us at
Supper, one to carve for us, and the other to help
us to Drink? Let us fancy ourselves <HI>Amadis's</HI> of
<HI>Gaul,</HI> or Don <HI>Quixots</HI> at least, that we are arrived
at some inchanted Castle, and have drove away
the Fairies that guarded it; and that Princesses
come to kiss our Hands, and take off our Armour.”
“Oh how gay you are! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel; it is very
well seen you are not in love.” “I love you, and
that's enough, <HI>said the Count;</HI> but I am not over-well
pleas'd that I said I was the wounded Person, since
I must assume a melancholy Air, and must not eat
tho I am ready to die of Hunger: It would have
been a thousand times better for you to have acted
this part, for I am sure the Presence of <HI>Isidora</HI> will
be every thing to you.” “If there was any way,
<HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>with a Smile,</HI> to say they were
mistaken, and that I am the wounded Person, I
would agree to it with all my heart, to ease you,
but since 'tis all done and over, neglect nothing to
persuade them that you are very bad.” “Very bad,
<HI>cry'd the Count,</HI> I beg your pardon there; let us
make the Wound but slight, that I may keep my
bed but a little while.” As he made an end of
these words, he cast himself upon the Bed that was
made for him, and soon after the Ladies came;
Donna <HI>Juana</HI> with a Napkin on her Arm, <HI>Isidora</HI>
with a silver gilt Porringer full of Broth, and <HI>Me∣lanthia</HI>
with two fresh Eggs on a Plate. “Here is
something for the wounded Pilgrim, <HI>said</HI> Juana,
<HI>going to the Bed-side;</HI> he may have either the Broth
or the Eggs.” “Madam, <HI>said the Count,</HI> (after he
had thank'd her for the Charity she exercised to∣wards
them, who were poor Strangers) I will, if
you'll give me leave, accept both of the Broth and
Eggs, with a little Bread to them: and I believe
I could eat a little Meat, for I have lost a great
deal of Blood; and if I don't recruit, I shall never
be able to go abroad.” “Heaven forbid, <HI>said Donna</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
Juana, that I should let a Person in your Condition
do what he would; if your Fever continues, it
will kill you: swallow the Yolk, and leave the
White, and drink a little of this Ptisan.” The
Count sigh'd at this Prescription; and for Don <HI>Ga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riel,</HI>
he got behind one of the Bed-Curtains, that
they should not see him laugh.</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was so much surprized at the good
Mein of the Count <HI>d' Aguilar,</HI> and at his Manner of
speaking, that she forgot to inquire after her Bro∣ther;
and attributing her Joy only to her Compas∣sion
for an unfortunate wounded Stranger, secretly
commended herself for the Good and Charity she
had done, and taking him by the Arm to feel his
Pulse, order'd a Candle to be brought, to see this
dying Pilgrim: but when she discover'd in his Eyes
a Fire that dazled hers, and such a Freshness in his
Complexion, which she thought proceeded from the
Violence of his Fever, she began to be sadly frigh∣ten'd.
“I am vex'd, <HI>said she,</HI> that you had that Egg;
you must eat nothing: I'll have the Management
of you, nobody shall look after you but myself.
Take care, <HI>continu'd she, to her Neices, and those that
were about her,</HI> that he has nothing given to eat
but what I order him; his Wounds require him to
observe a sparing Diet.” “Alas! Madam, <HI>answer'd
the Count in a melancholy Tone,</HI> I am not used to the
Ways of Persons of Quality; I am of a Tempera∣ment
quite different from them, what would cure
them will kill me: However, <HI>added he,</HI> I'll try, it
may learn me better against another time.”</P>
<P>After this Discourse she sat herself down by the
Bed-side, taking hold of the Count's Arm, to ob∣serve
the Symptoms of his Fever; when casting her
Eyes about, she discover'd Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> behind the
Curtain, and said to him, “Be not afraid of Ladies,
who perform the Rites of Hospitality with a great
deal of pleasure.” Whereupon Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> made
her a low Bow with so good a Grace, that both
Aunt and Neices were suprized. “Are you Bro∣thers?
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
<HI>said she</HI>” “Yes, Madam, <HI>said he.</HI>” “And
what are your Names?” “My Brother's, <HI>reply'd
he,</HI> is Don <HI>Estevus,</HI> and mine Don <HI>Gabriel.</HI>” “And
are you <HI>Flemmings? continu'd</HI> Juana.” “We come
from <HI>Brussels, said he;</HI> our Father was a Musick-Master,
a Writer of Novels and Romances, and a
Maker of Songs.” “What was he an Inventor of
Fairy Stories? <HI>cry'd</HI> Juana.” “Yes, Madam, <HI>reply'd
he,</HI> both old and modern.” “Oh, <HI>added she,</HI> you
must tell me one then to-night, or I shall not
sleep: But now I think on it, have you never seen
Don <HI>Felix Sarmiento,</HI> with the Governour of the
<HI>Low-Countries?</HI>” “Yes, Madam, I have had that
honour, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel; he has a Command un∣der
him, and lives like a Prince: He would have
sent us, if my Father would have given his Con∣sent,
into <HI>Andalusia,</HI> to his Sister and two Daugh∣ters.”
“What to do? <HI>reply'd</HI> Juana <HI>with Warmth.</HI>”
“He said, <HI>continu'd Don</HI> Gabriel, that his Wife was
lately dead, and that his Daughters lived in the
Country, where we were to go, to learn them to
dance, and sing, and play upon Musick.” “How
strangely things fall out! <HI>said she to her Neices.</HI> You
must know, Friend, <HI>added she,</HI> that I am his Sister,
and these are his Daughters; you are only mista∣ken
in the Country, for we are in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> and you
said <HI>Andalusia.</HI>” “Madam, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
these Faults are excusable in Strangers: we are
very happy to light on a Place where we have
some little knowledge of the Family.” “But how
came you to go to <HI>St. Jacques? added she.</HI>” “Out
of a pure Sense of Devotion, <HI>said he,</HI> and a Desire
to travel.” “But, <HI>said Donna</HI> Juana, how came your
Father, who refused my Brother, to let you go?”
“Oh Madam, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel, <HI>a little confounded,</HI>
he is a very religious Man, and would be loth to
hinder us from so good an Undertaking.”</P>
<P>All this while the Count, whom I shall now call
Don <HI>Estevus,</HI> said not one word; for Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
forbid him from speaking, and whenever he open'd
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
his mouth, clapt her hand upon it with such force,
that he apprehended more from that manner of ma∣king
him hold his tongue, than any thing else; and
repented often, that he did not let his Cousin repre∣sent
the sick Person. When the Supper was brought
up, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> out of Respect was for eating it in
the Antichamber: but Donna <HI>Juana</HI> would not suf∣fer
him to stir; but order'd her Neices to make him
eat, while she felt Don <HI>Estevus</HI>'s Pulse, which she
thought somewhat intermitting. Now had she
examined Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s, 'tis probable she might have
found his so: For tho he had form'd to himself a
charming Idea of <HI>Isidora,</HI> yet when he saw her, he
found she excel'd that Idea as much as the Sun the
Stars; and tho he endeavour'd all that was in his
power not to look at her, yet he could not forbear
fixing his Eyes so passionately on her sometimes,
that the Aunt, who observ'd him often, said, “What
makes you look so much at my Neice?” “Ma∣dam,
<HI>said he, without any Disorder,</HI> I am something
of a Physiognomist, have always had a great Incli∣nation
to study Astrology, and I dare say that if
ever I succeeded in any thing, 'twas in Horoscopes.”
“Oh! <HI>said</HI> Isidora, then I must have a little Dis∣course
with you: I have wish'd a long time to
meet with somebody that could tell me my For∣tune.”
“Madam, <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel, <HI>who could not
contain himself,</HI> a Lady of your Perfections may pro∣mise
herself every thing.” “Can you, <HI>said Donna</HI>
Juana, read any Good-fortune in her Face?” “I
never saw finer things all the days of my life, <HI>re∣ply'd
Don</HI> Gabriel; I am amaz'd and surpriz'd.”
“Oh! this is a delicate Science, <HI>said</HI> Juana, for the
Terms are neither hard nor barbarous: I must
have a little Talk with you myself about my For∣tune.”</P>
<P>While they had all this Discourse, the Count was
both hungry, hot, and weary: for the old Lady,
who would not suffer him to eat a bit, as I said be∣fore,
had also cover'd him up so close, that he was
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
almost smother'd, and not able to bear it any lon∣ger,
and to ease himself, begg'd that he might get
up for a little while. “I'll give my Consent, <HI>said
she,</HI> on condition your Brother will give me his
word you shall eat nothing for Supper.” Which
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> consented to, without any reluctance;
and tho he and the Count regretted the parting
with <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they were both so glad
to get rid of the troublesome Aunt, that they for∣warded
their Departure, as much as the Parts they
acted and their Respect would allow.</P>
<P>When they were left alone with the Almoner,
they gave him so many good Reasons, telling him
that he must either eat or die, that he, being a
good honest Fellow that loved Pilgrims, and not
having supped, sat down with them at the Table;
where the Count made amends for what he endured
in bed, and Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who eat not with a good
Appetite while <HI>Isidora</HI> was by, follow'd his example
so well, that they clear'd all before them. When
he was gone, and they at liberty, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> ask'd
the Count, if he ever saw any thing equal to <HI>Isi∣dora?</HI>
“She is a perfect Beauty, <HI>answer'd the other:</HI>
but <HI>Melanthia</HI> in my opinion has an inexhaustible
Store of Charms; her Shape and Complexion, the
Evenness of her Teeth, the Brightness of her fine
black Hair, and that Air of Sprightliness and Mirth
dispers'd all over her Person, are as touching and
engaging as the languishing Softness of <HI>Isidora.</HI>”
I am very glad, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, that you was
not taken by her incomparable Beauty.” “I don't
deny, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> but she is a Beauty; but
I am overjoy'd that I am sensible of her Sister's
superiour Merit, since you would not have me
your Rival. Heaven forbid! <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel; I
believe I love her so well, that I could die for
her.” “But since you have taken upon you to be
an Astrologer, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> when you come
to your Fortune-telling, do me all the service you
can with <HI>Melanthia.</HI>” “What would you at last give
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
way to Love, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>smiling?</HI>” “I have
no great Desire to it, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> but let
what will happen, do me all the service you can.”
“Well, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, preserve your Liberty
if you can. Alas! what would you have me do
here? <HI>reply'd he somewhat angrily:</HI> Ought not I to
have something to make me amends for what I
endure with Donna <HI>Juana?</HI> for not to deceive you,
<HI>added he,</HI> she has almost tired my Patience, the
Interest she takes in my Health hath already in∣jur'd
me but too much.” As it was then late,
they left off their Discourse, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> re∣tired
to his Chamber, which was separated from
the Count's by a large Hall; where he, as well as
his Cousin, slept as little as People in love are used
to do.</P>
<P>For <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they follow'd their Aunt
to her Chamber, afterwards retired to their own,
and that Night lay together, that they might talk
away some Hours; but when they were got into
bed, instead of talking, they did nothing but tum∣ble,
and toss, and sigh. “What is the matter you
don't sleep, <HI>said</HI> Isidora, are you not well?” “But
what's the matter you don't go to rest?” <HI>reply'd</HI> Me∣lanthia.
At that <HI>Isidera</HI> fetch'd a deep Sigh, and
return'd no Answer. Some time after <HI>Melanthia</HI>
hearing <HI>Isidora</HI> sigh again, said, (embracing her)
“You are very melancholy, and would fain hide it
from me; what dare not you trust me?” “I ne∣ver
was so in my life before, <HI>said she,</HI> but my
Tears are so unworthy of me, that I am ashamed
of them.” “You fright me, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia, for
tho I don't comprehend what you would say, yet
I am persuaded you are not so melancholy with∣out
a Cause; therefore if you love me, remove
my Fears, and let me know your Griefs.” “I swear
to you Sister, <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora, I cannot tell what
ails me; but since you will have me be more par∣ticular,
I must own, that after I had been some
time in the Room with those Travellers, I found
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
myself very much concern'd for him that is
wounded, he appear'd so charming in his mean
Habit, that I said to myself, What would this
young Man be, were he of Quality, and finely
dress'd, since he has such a noble Mien in his or∣dinary
Clothes? I flatter'd myself that he might
be a Person of Birth and Family in that Disguise;
but when his Brother told my Aunt that they
were Musicians, it went like a Dagger to my
Heart, that I should have any Inclination for a
Man so much below me, I that was never guilty
of any such Weakness for any Man before.”</P>
<P>“Alas! Sister, <HI>cry'd</HI> Melanthia, I have too great a
share in your Complaints to be insensible: Don
<HI>Gabrie!</HI> has charm'd me with his Voice, and I was
lost when I observed, for all that ridiculous Pil∣grim's
Habit, a good Shape, regular Features, and
an Air and Mien not to be equalled in Persons of
the best Rank.” “They are amiable, that's true,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora, but Heaven defend us from looking
on them any otherwise than as Musicians; and I
think we ought to hasten their Departure.”
“Would you be the Cause of the poor wounded
Man's Death? <HI>said</HI> Melanthia:” “No, <HI>answer'd the
other,</HI> but I'd have him cured, that he may go a∣bout
his business; for I'm persuaded 'tis our best
way to shun Persons that may create us any trou∣ble.”
“Alas! I'll consent to it, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia,
and will second you with all my heart.” As thus
they talk'd, Day broke, and then they endeavour'd
to get a little Rest.</P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> she pass'd the Night as indif∣ferently
as any of them, for fear the Pilgrim should
be worse than when she left him; and as it was
too late, when they came, to think of a Surgeon,
she sent in the Morning for two of the best in <HI>Ciu∣dad-Real,</HI>
and as soon as they came, carried them
into the Count's Chamber. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was with
him when <HI>Juana</HI> and the Surgeons came, and knew
not at first but that they were some of the Dome∣sticks,
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
till she bid the Count prepare himself for
some Operation, telling him that he was in the
hands of as able Practitioners as any in <HI>Spain.</HI>
While she was thus encouraging the Count, the
Surgeons were preparing all their Materials, as
their Instruments, Tents, and Ointment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
for the Count, 'tis almost impossible to comprehend
the Confusion he was in; looking sometimes at Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> with Eyes full of Rage and Anger, and
sometimes making Signs, as if all would be disco∣ver'd:
when Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who was not so much
perplex'd, said to Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> “We never travel,
Madam, without some of the Powder of Sympa∣thy
about us, the Effects of which are wonder∣ful,
for I put but a little of it last Night to my
Brother's Wound, and I believe it will soon be
well.” At that the Surgeons exclaim'd against it
as a pernicious Remedy, saying, That 'twas all Sor∣cery,
and that the holy Inquisition would not allow
of it. At the frightful Name of the Inquisition,
Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was for running away, but that the
Count assured her, That the Powder was prepared
by himself, and was only a Compound of Simples,
which he would give her the Receipt of. After
this, she desired the Surgeons might look at his
Wound, whether they did any thing or nothing;
but he not acquiescing with that Request, she paid
them for their Trouble, and so dismiss'd them.</P>
<P>But <HI>Juana</HI> was unwilling to leave the Count <HI>d' A∣guilar</HI>
so soon, and therefore sought a Pretext that
she might stay a little longer with him; and ad∣dressing
herself to Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> said, “Since you
are well versed in Romances and Stories, you'll do
me a singular Pleasure in telling me one, for I am
a great Admirer of them.” “That I will, to oblige
you, Madam,” <HI>reply'd he:</HI> and so began as follows.</P>

<HEAD>The Royal Ram.</HEAD>
<P>IN those happy Days, when Fairies were com∣mon,
there lived a King who had three beau∣tiful
young Daughters, who were all deserving;
but the youngest, whose Name was <HI>Miranda,</HI> being
the most amiable, and her Father's Favourite, was
allow'd as many Clothes in a Month, as her Sisters
had in a Year: but she being so generous as to let
them partake with her, it made no difference a∣mongst
them.</P>
<P>The King having bad Neighbours, who, tired
with a long Peace, obliged him to raise an Army,
and to take the field, left his Daughters with a Go∣vernant
in a Castle, where they might hear News
from him every day; and when he had subdued his
Enemies, and drove them out of his Dominions,
came to the Castle to see his <HI>Miranda,</HI> whom he
doated on. The three Princesses bespoke them∣selves
every one a Robe of Sattin; the Eldest's was
Green adorn'd with Emeralds, the Second's was
Blue set off with Turquoises, and the Youngest's
White bedeck'd with Diamonds: and in these Dres∣ses
they went to meet the King, and congratulate
him on his Victories.</P>
<P>When he saw them so beautiful and gay, he em∣braced
them all tenderly, but especially <HI>Miranda.</HI>
After a magnificent Entertainment that was served
up, the King, who loved to draw Consequences from
the most trivial Matters, when they were ask'd, the
Eldest, why she put on a green Gown? “Sir, <HI>said
she,</HI> after hearing of your great Deeds, I thought
Green might express my Joy, and the Hopes of
your Return:” “That's very well,” <HI>said the King.</HI>
And you Daughter, <HI>continued he to the Second,</HI> how
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome you to put on a Blue Gown?” “To shew,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, <HI>said she,</HI> we ought to implore the Gods in
Your favour, and that in seeing you I behold the
Heavens and the brightest Stars.” “Now, <HI>said the
King,</HI> you speak like an Oracle. And you, <HI>Miran∣da,
said the King,</HI> what made you dress yourself in
White?” “Because, <HI>says she,</HI> it becomes me better
than other Colours:” “How, <HI>said the King a little
angrily,</HI> was that only your Design?” “I had that of
pleasing you, <HI>said the Princess,</HI> and I think I need
no other.” Whereupon the King was mightily
pleased at her Turn of Thought, and said, That
since he had eaten a pretty deal at Supper, he
would not go to bed so soon, therefore he would
have them tell him their Dreams the Night before
his Return.</P>
<P>The Fldest said, she dreamt he brought her a
Gown, the Gold and Jewels of which were brighter
than the Sun; the Second said, she dreamt that he
brought her a golden Spinning-Wheel and Distaff,
for her to spin herself some Shirts; and the Youngest
said, she dreamt he had married her second Sister
off, and on the Wedding-day held a golden Ewer,
and said, <HI>Come,</HI> Miranda, <HI>come and w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh you.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who was angry at this Dream, knit
his Brow, and made a thousand wry Faces, and
went into his Chamber, where throwing himself
upon his Bed, he could not forget his Daughter's
Dream: “This insolent Baggage, <HI>said he,</HI> would
make me her domestick Slave; I am not amazed
now, why she put on a white Gown with thin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
of me, she looks on me as one unworthy of her
Reflections, but I'll prevent her ill Designs.” Here∣upon
he got up in a Rage, and tho it was not yet
Day, he sent for the Captain of his Guards, and
said to him, “You have h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da's</HI> Dream,
which forebodes some Treason, therefore I would
have you take her presently, and carry her into
the Forest, and kill her, and afterwards bring me
her Heart and Tongue: if you deceive me, I'll
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
put you to the most cruel Death I can think of”
The Captain of the Guards was very much surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at so barbarous an Order, but durst not seem aver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to it, lest the King should take away his Commis∣sion,
but promis'd him to perform it. Then going
to the Princess's Chamber, which he had much ado
to get to, it being so very early, he told her, the
King sent for her; whereupon she rose presently:
a little <HI>Meer</HI> that she call'd <HI>Patypata</HI> held up her
Train, and her young Ape and little Dog, which she
nam'd <HI>Grabgeon</HI> and <HI>Tintin,</HI> ran by her side.</P>
<P>The Captain of the Guard carried her into the
Garden, telling her, the King was taking there a
little fresh Air and then pretending to look for him,
and not finding him, told her, he was without dis∣pute
gone from thence into the Forest. Then
opening the little Door that led into the Forest,
and Day coming on, the Princess observ'd that her
Conductor shed some Tears and seem'd melancholy;
Whereupon she said to him, with an Air of Sweet∣ness,
“What is the matter you seem so much af∣flicted
at?” “Alas! Madam, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> who can be other∣wise,
the King has order'd me to kill you here, and
to carry him your Heart and Tongue, or else he
will put me to death.” At these Words the poor
Princess turn'd pale, and fell a crying, and in that
Condition look'd like a Lamb that was going to
the Slaughter; then fixing her Eyes on the Cap∣tain,
without any Anger said to him, “Have you
Courage enough to kill me, who never did you
any Injury in my Life, but rather always spoke
to the King in your favour? But if I have de∣serv'd
my Father's Anger, I submit without mur∣muring.
Alas! I have shewn him but too much
Love and Respect, for him to complain without in∣justice.”
“Fear not, fair Princess, <HI>said the Officer,</HI> I'll
sooner suffer the Death I am threaten'd with, than
be guilty of so barbarous an Action; but when I
am gone, you will not be more safe: we must
find out some Expedient to persuade the King
you are dead.”</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="36"/>
“What way can we find out? <HI>reply'd</HI> Miranda,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he will not be satisfy'd unless he sees my Tongue
and Heart.” At that <HI>Patypata,</HI> who stood by, and
heard all without being observ'd either by the
Princess or the Captain, advanc'd boldly, and throw∣ing
herself at <HI>Miranda</HI>'s Feet, said, “I come, Ma∣dam,
to offer you my Life, let me be the Sacrifice;
I shall be but too well pleas'd to die for so good
a Mistress.” “I have no need of so tender a Proof
of thy Friendship, <HI>said the Princess,</HI> (kissing her)
thy Life ought now to be as dear to me as my
own.” Whereupon <HI>Grabugeon</HI> came forward, and
said, “You are in the right, my Princess, to love so
faithful a Slave as <HI>Patypata;</HI> she may be more
serviceable to you than I can, therefore I offer
you my Heart and Tongue with joy.” “Oh my
pretty <HI>Grabugeon, reply'd</HI> Miranda, I cannot bear
the thoughts of taking thy Life away.” With
that <HI>Tintin</HI> cry'd out, that it was insupportable to
so faithful a Dog as he was, that any other but him
should lay down their Life for his Mistress, and
thereupon arose a great dispute between <HI>Patypata,
Grabugeon</HI> and <HI>Tintin:</HI> in short, <HI>Grabugeon</HI> being quicker
than the rest, climb'd up to the top of a high Tree,
and threw himself down and broke his Neck;
and the Captain of the Guard with a great deal
of Persuasion got leave of the Princess to cut out
his Tongue, but it prov'd too small for to venture
to cheat the King with it.</P>
<P>“Alas! my poor little Ape, <HI>said the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess,</HI> thou
hast lost thy Life without doing me any Service!”
“That Honour is reserv'd for me, <HI>interrupted the</HI>
Moor;” and at the same time cut her Throat with
the Knife that <HI>Grabugeon</HI>'s Tongue was cut out with.
The Officer was for carrying her Tongue, but that
it was too black to think of it. “How unfortunate
am I, <HI>said the Princess, weeping,</HI> thus to lose what
I love, and not to be one whit the better for it.”
“If you had accepted of my Proposition, <HI>said</HI> Tintin,
you would have had none to have griev'd for but
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
me, and I should have had the Satisfaction of be∣ing
regretted alone.” Whereupon <HI>Miranda</HI> kiss'd
her little Dog, and cry'd and griev'd so much, that
she swoon'd away, and when she came to herself,
found her Dog dead, her Conductor gone, and she
herself left with her three dead Favourites; which
she buried in a hole that was ready dug hard by
a Tree, and then bethought herself of her own
Security.</P>
<P>As the Forest was not far from her Father's Court,
it was not safe for her to stay there long, lest she
should be known to some of the Passengers, there∣fore
she made all the haste she could to get out of
it; but the Forest was so large, and the Sun so hot,
that she was ready to die with Heat, Fear and
Weariness; and was in continual Apprehensions lest
her Father should follow and kill her. But still con∣tinu'd
going forwards, making lamentable Com∣plaints,
having her Gown almost tore off, and her
Skin scratch'd by the Thorns and Brambles. At
last hearing the bleating of Sheep, “Without doubt,
<HI>said she to herself,</HI> here are some Shepherds with
their Flocks, who may direct me to some Hamlet
where I may disguise myself in some Country-Dress.
For alas! <HI>continued she,</HI> Princes are not al∣ways
the most happy: Who believes that I am a
Run-away, that my Father without any cause or
reason seeks my Life, and that I to save it must be
fore'd to disguise myself?” While she was making
these Reflections, she arriv'd at the place from
whence she heard the bleating: but how great was
her Surprize, when she came to a spacious Plain,
to see a large Ram as white as Snow, his Horns
were gilt, a Garland of Flowers was fasten'd about
his Neck, his Legs were adorn'd with Bracelets of
Pearl of a prodigious size, and he was laid on
Orange-Flowers, and shaded from the Heat of the
Sun by a Pavillion of Cloth of Gold! An hundred
Sheep finely adorn'd were waiting about him, some
drinking Coffee, Sherbet and Lemonade; others
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting Strawberries and Cream, and Sweatmeats;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d others again playing at Lansquenet and Basset;
some had rich Collars of Gold with a gallant De∣vice,
and some their Ears bor'd and full of Rib∣bons.
<HI>Miranda</HI> was so much amaz'd, that she was
perfectly motionless, and look'd all about for the
Shepherd of such an extraordinary Flock, when
the beautiful Ram came bounding and skipping, and
said, “Approach, divine Princess, be not afraid of
such gentle pacifick Creatures as we are.” “What
Prodigy is this, <HI>said the Princess,</HI> (stepping back) to
hear Sheep speak?” “Alas! Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Ram,</HI> your Ape and Dog spoke, and why is it more
strange that we should? “A Fairy, <HI>answer'd</HI> Mi∣randa,
bestow d that Gift upon them.” “And
might not the like Adventure attend us? <HI>reply'd the
R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m smiling:</HI> but, my Princess, what brought you
hither?” “A thousand Misfortunes, <HI>reply'd</HI> Mi∣randa;
I am the most miserable Person in the
World, and seek an Asylum to avoid the Rage of a
Father.” “Come, Madam, with me, <HI>reply'd the Ram,</HI>
I will afford you one, where you shall be known
to none, and be absolute Mistress.” “But I am
not able to follow you, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> I am so weary.”
Whereupon the Ram order'd his Chariot, and soon
after appear'd six Goats harness'd to a Gourd-shell,
large enough for two Persons to sit in it with ease,
and lin'd with Velvet. The Princess plac'd herself
in it, admiring an Equipage so novel, and the Ram
got in after her, and then drove to a Cavern's
Mouth, which was stop'd by a large Stone, which
on the Ram's touching with his Foot remov'd. Af∣ter
which, he told the Princess she might go down
without any danger, which she would hardly have
ever consented to, had not her Fear of being taken
prompted her to it; and upon that account she never
hesitated, but follow'd her Conductor.</P>
<P>As the Steps were very numerous, the Princess
thought that she was either going to pay a Visit to
their Antipodes, or the <HI>Elysian</HI> Shades; but was much
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
more surpirz'd when she discover'd a vast Plain en∣amel'd
with various Flowers, which exceeded all
the Perfumes she had ever smelt of, surrounded
with a large River of Orange-flower Water. In
the midst of this Plain were Fountains of Wine,
Rosa-solis, and other exquisite Liquors, which form'd
Cascades and pleasant purling Brooks, and here
and there Holts of Trees, which serv'd for shelter
to variety of choice Birds and Fowls, as Partridge,
Quails, Pheasants, Ortolans, Turkies, Pullets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and in some parts the Air was darken'd with
Showers of Biscuits, blanched Almonds, Tarts.
Cheesecakes, Marrow-Puddings, all manner of Sweet∣meats
both wet and dry; and in short, with all
Necessaries for Life, with great plenty of Crown∣pieces,
Guineas, Pearls and Diamonds. Without
doubt the rarity and usefulness of this Rain would
have brought the <HI>Royal Ram</HI> a great many Visitors,
if he had been desirous of Company; but all the
Writers that mention him, assure us, that he chose
to be retir'd, and was as grave as any <HI>Roman</HI>
Senator.</P>
<P>As it was the pleasantest Season of the Year when
<HI>Miranda</HI> arriv'd there, she saw no other Palace
than what Chambers, Halls and Closets, Orange∣trees,
Jessamine, Honey-suckles and Rose-trees
form'd by intermixing their Boughs. The Princely
Ram told <HI>Miranda,</HI> “That he had reign'd Sove∣reign
there several Years, and had sufficient cause
to be afflicted, but that he refrain'd from his
Tears, that he might not remind her of her Mis∣fortunes.”
“Your manner of Treatment, charm∣ing
Sheep, <HI>said she,</HI> is somewhat so generous, that
I cannot express my Acknowledgment enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and I must confess, that what I see seems
so extraordinary, I know not what to think of
it.” No sooner had she pronouc'd these Words,
but there appear'd a Troop of beautiful Nymphs,
who presented her with Fruit out of Amber Bas∣kets;
but when she went nigh them, they insen∣sibly
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
mov'd from her; and at last reaching out her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and to take hold of one of them, and feeling
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othing, she soon perceiv'd they were only Phan∣toms.
“Alas! <HI>said she, weeping,</HI> where am I, and
what were these?” At that instant the <HI>Royal
Ram,</HI> for so I must call him, returning, having left
her some Moments, and seeing her shed Tears,
remain'd motionless, and ready to die at her feet.</P>
<P>“What is the matter with my beautiful Princess,
<HI>said he,</HI> have I any way fail'd in the Respect that
is due to you?” “No, <HI>said she,</HI> but I am not
used to live among the Dead, and with Sheep
that talk, every thing here terrifies me; and tho
my Obligation is great to you for bringing me
hither, yet I must beg one favour more of you,
to conduct me back.” “Fright not your self, <HI>re∣ply'd
he,</HI> vouchsafe to hear me quietly, and you
shall know my deplorable Adventure.”</P>
<P>“I was born a Prince; a great Race of Kings,
who were my Ancestors, left me in possession of
one of the most beautiful Kingdoms in the World;
my Subjects lov'd me, my Neighbours both fear'd
and envy'd me, and I was esteem'd with some
Justice. My Person was not indifferent to those
that saw me, and being a great Lover of Hunting,
as I was one day pursuing a Stag, and separated
from my Attendants, the Stag took into a Pond,
I plung'd my Horse in after him with too much
Imprudence as well as Rashness; but instead of
finding the Water cold, I found it extraordinary
hot, and the Pond becoming dry all on a sudden,
there issued out of a Clift a terrible Fire, and I fell to
the bottom from off the Precipice, where I could see
nothing but Flames. I believ'd my self lost, when
I heard a Voice say, They must be greater Flames
that warm thy Heart, ungrateful Man. Alas!
cry'd I, who's that, that complains of my Cold∣ness?
An unfortunate Wretch, reply'd the Voice,
who adores you without Hope. At the same
time the Fire went out, and I saw a Fairy whom
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
I knew from my Youth, and whose Age and Ugli¦ness
always frighten'd me; she was leaning on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
young Slave of incomparable Beauty, who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
loaded with Chains of Gold to denote her Slavery

now? must I be forced to explain myself? My Eye
used never to fail of Conquest, have they now
lost all their Power? Consider how low I stoop
'tis a Fairy that makes this Confession, and King
are in respect to them but as Ants.” “I am entire∣ly
at your pleasure, <HI>said I to her, with an Air am
Tone that expr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss'd some Impatience,</HI> but what is it that
you ask? is it my Crown, my Cities, or my Trea∣sures?”
Oh Wretch! <HI>reply'd she disdainfully,</HI> I can
“make my Skullions, when I please, greater than
thee; I ask thy Heart, my Eyes have ask'd it a
thousand times, and thou hast not understood
them, or at least wouldst not. Wert thou engag'd
with any other, I should not interrupt thee in thy
Amours, but I have too great an Interest in thee,
not to discover the Indifference of thy Heart.”
“Ah! grant me thy Love, <HI>added she,</HI> (shutting her
Mouth, to render it the more agreeable, and rolling
her Eyes about) I will be thy dear <HI>Ragotte,</HI> will
and twenty Kingdoms to that thou possessest, an
hundred Towers of Gold, five hundred full of
Silver, and whatever thou canst desire besides.”</P>
<P>“Madam <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gotte, said I to her,</HI> I beg of you by all
the Charms that render you lovely, to set me at
liberty, and then we'll see what I can do to
please you.” “Oh Traytor! <HI>cry'd she,</HI> if thou lov∣edst
me, thou wouldst not hone so much after thy
own Kingdom, but wouldst be content to live in
a Grotto, Wood, or Desert. Don't believe me to
be so great a Novice, thou thinkst of stealing a∣way
but I tell you for your Comfort, you must
stay here; and the first thing you shall do, shall
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
be to keep my Sheep, which have as much Wit,
and speak as well as thou dost.” At the same time
she brought me into this Plain, where we are
now, and show'd me her Flock, which I looked
on but little, for that beautiful Slave that was
with her took up all my Regard, and my Eyes
betray'd me; which the cruel <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gotte</HI> observing,
flew upon her, and stabb'd her into the Eye with
her Bodkin, and so deprived that adorable Object
of her Life. At this dismal Sight I fell on <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gotte,</HI>
and clapping my Hand upon my Sword, was going
to sacrifice her to the <HI>Manes</HI> of that dear Slave,
had she not render'd me motionless by her Art. My
Efforts being vain, I fell on the Ground, and endea∣vour'd
to kill my self, to deliver my self from that
wretched State I was reduc'd to; when she, with
an ironical Smile, said to me, “I will make you
feel my Power; you are at present a Lion, but
shall e'er long be a Sheep.” Whereupon touching
me with her Wand, I found myself metamorphosed,
such as you see me, but retain both my Speech, and
those Senti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents of Grief which I owe to my un∣happy
State. “Thou shalt be five Years a Sheep,
<HI>continued she,</HI> and absolute Master of this sweet A∣bode;
while I separated from thee, and never be∣holding
thy agreeable Form, shall think on no∣thing
but the Hatred I bear thee.” Hereupon she
disappear'd, and if any thing could have soften'd my
Misfortunes, or given any Allay to my Disgrace,
'twas her Absence.</P>
<P>The Sheep she spoke of, acknowledged me to be
their King, told me all their Misfortunes, how
they displeased the revengeful Fairy, how she had
composed a Flock of them, and that they all under∣went
the same Punishment. But, <HI>added <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> when
their Time is expired, they resume their own
Forms, and leave the Flock; and for those who are
<HI>Ragott<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ls or Enemies, whom she has kill'd,

the World again: of which number the young
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
Slave is, whom I told you of. I have seen her seve∣ral
Months together, but she never speaks to me;
and when I approach'd towards her, it grieved me,
when I knew it was only a Shadow: but having
observed one of my Flock always by that Phantom,
I understood he was her Lover, whom <HI>Ragotte,</HI> jea∣lous
of the tender Impressions they made on each
other, had taken from her.</P>
<P>This was the Reason that made me remove from
that Fairy, and for these last three Years think of
nothing but my Liberty; which was what engaged
me to go often into the Forest, where I sometimes
have seen you, fair Princess, driving your Chaise, like
<HI>Diana</HI> in her silver Chariot, and other times mounted
on a fiery Steed, riding over the Plains with the
Princesses and Ladies of the Court, and like ano∣ther,
always sure to gain the Prize. Alas! if at
those times I durst have spoke, what fine things
should I not have said! when my Heart offer'd up
its secret Vows; but how would you have received
the Declaration of an unhappy Sheep like me?</P>
<P><HI>Miranda</HI> was so much concern'd at what she
heard, that she hardly knew what Answer to make;
however, paying him some Civilities, which gave
him some hopes, she told him, she should not be so
much afraid of those Shades, since they were to
come to life again: “But alas! <HI>continued she,</HI> if my
poor <HI>Patypata,</HI> my dear <HI>Grabugeon,</HI> and my pretty
<HI>Tintin,</HI> who died to serve me, were to meet with
the like Fate, I should not be so much concern'd
here.”</P>
<P>Tho the Royal Ram underwent great Disgraces,
yet had he a great many admirable Privileges, “Go,
<HI>said he,</HI> (to his first Squire, who was a Sheep of a
good Mien) go fetch the <HI>Moor,</HI> the Monkey, and
the little Dog, their Shades may divert our Prin∣cess.”
Soon after <HI>Miranda</HI> saw them, and tho
they came not nigh enough to be touch'd by her,
yet their Presence was some Comfort to her. In
short, the Royal Ram, who was endued with all
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
the Wit and Delicacy proper to support an agreeable
Conversation, was so passionately in love with <HI>Mi∣randa,</HI>
that she began to have some Regard for him,
and to make some Returns; for what can be dis∣pleasing
in a beautiful, kind, caressing Sheep, espe∣cially
when known to be a King, whose Metamor∣phose
was to have an end? Thus the Princess pass'd
her Days in the sweet Expectation of a more hap∣py
Fate, while the gallant Ram, whose Thoughts
were solely bent on her, made Entertainments,
Concerts of Musick, and did every thing that was
in his power to divert her; his Troop assisting him
in them, and the Shades contributing somewhat
thereunto.</P>
<P>One Evening, when the Couriers arriv'd, for he
was very fond of News, and always had the best,
they told him, That the eldest Sister of the Princess
<HI>Miranda</HI> was going to marry a Great Prince, and
that the Nuptials were to be very magnificent.
“Alas! <HI>cry'd the young Princess,</HI> how unfortunate am
I, not to see such fine things? I am here under
ground with Ghosts and Sheep, while my Sister,
who will be dress'd as fine as a Queen, will have
all the Court made to her, and I shall be the only
one that will not partake of her Joy.” “Madam,
why do you complain, <HI>said the Royal Ram to her,</HI>
have I deny'd your going to the Wedding? Go
when you please, but give me your Word you
will come again; if you deny me this, you shall
see me expire at your feet, for my Love is too
violent, for me to support myself, when I shall
lose you.” <HI>Miranda</HI> promised him nothing should
prevent her Return; he gave her an Equipage suit∣able
to her Birth: she was dress'd very richly, and
neglected nothing that might set off her Charms;
she got into a Chariot of Mother of Pearl, drawn
by six Creatures that were half Griffins, and newly
arriv'd from the <HI>Antipod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and was attended by a
great number of Officers, that were richly dress'd,
and who had been sent a great way to make up her
Train.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="45"/>
With this Equipage she arrived at the King her
Father's Court, just when they were celebrating
the Marriage; as soon as she enter'd, she surprized
all that saw her, with the Lustre of her Beauty
and Jewels, and heard nothing but Acclamations it
her own praise. The King look'd at her with
great Attention and Pleasure, which put her into
some fear lest he should know her; but he was so
much prepossess'd with her Death, that he had not
the least Idea of her. Nevertheless, the Apprehen∣sion
of being stopt prevented her staying till the Ce∣remony
was over, but made her go away suddenly,
leaving a Box of Jewels behind her, whereon these
Words were writ, <HI>These Jewels are for the new-mar∣ried
Couple:</HI> And when they open'd it, there was no∣thing
in it. The King, who had flatter'd himself
with some Hopes, and was desirous to know who
she was, was in the utmost despair when he knew
she was gone, and order'd his Officers, whenever
she came again, to shut the Gates and keep her.
Tho <HI>Miranda</HI> was not long absent, yet it seem'd an
Age to the Royal Ram, who waited for her by a Foun∣tain'd
Side in the thickest of the Forest, where he
had brought out immense Riches to offer her as an
Acknowledgment of her Return. As soon as he
saw her, he ran towards her skipping and bound∣ing,
caress'd her in his manner a thousand times,
laid himself down at her Feet, kiss'd her Hands,
told her his Disquiets and Impatience; wherein his
Passion affo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded him so much Eloquence, that the
Princess was charm'd with it.</P>
<P>Some time afterwards the King married his se∣cond
Daughter, and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> being inform'd of it,
desir'd the Ram to let her go again; who at that
Proposition was extremely grieved: A secret Fore∣sight
prepossess'd him with his Misfortune, but as
it is not always in our power to prevent what we
foresee, so his Complacency to the Princess over∣balancing
his Interest in her, he was not able to
deny her. “You will leave me, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
but this proceeds more from my Ill-Fortune than
from you; I consent to your Desires, since I never
could make you a greater Sacrifice.” She assur'd him
she would stay no longer than she had done before,
that she should be as much concern'd as himself to
be detain'd, and desir'd him not to make himself
uneasy. In short, she had the same Equipage as
before, and arrived there just as the Ceremony be∣gan.
Her Presence, notwithstanding their Atten∣tion
to the Ceremony, occasion'd a general Shout
of Joy and Admiration, and drew the Eyes of all
the Princes upon her; who found her Beauty so
extraordinary and uncommon, that they could hard∣ly
believe her to be mortal. The King was over∣joy'd
to see her again, and never took his Eyes off
from her but once, to give Orders to lock up all
the Gates. When the Ceremony was almost over,
the Princess got up suddenly to steal out of the
Crowd, but was very much surpriz'd and vex'd to
find all the Gates shut. The King went up to her
with great Respect, and a Submission that gave her
some Encouragement, desiring her not to deprive
him so soon of the Pleasure of seeing her, and to
honour him and his Court with her Presence.
Then leading her into a magnificent Hall, where all
the Court was, he himself held a golden Bason full of
Water for her to wash her Hands in. At this the
Princess, who was no longer Mistress of her Trans∣port,
threw herself at his feet, and embracing his
Knees, said, “See, Sir, my Dream is fulfilled, you
have held a Bason for me to wash in the Day of
my Sister's Wedding, without any Misfortune at∣tending
you.”</P>
<P>The King soon knew her to be his Daughter
<HI>Miranda,</HI> and embracing her, and shedding some
Tears, said, “Alas! my dear Child, can you forget
the Cruelty of a Father, who would have sacri∣ficed
your Life, because he thought your Dream
denoted the Loss of his Crown: It shall be so,
<HI>continued he,</HI> since both your Sisters are married,
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
and have each a Crown, mine shall be yours.”
And at that instant rising up, he put the Crown on
the Princess's Head, and then said, <HI>The Gods preserve
the Queen</HI> Miranda. Whereupon the whole Court
gave a great Shout of Joy, and her two Sisters came
and hung about her Neck, and embraced her a
thousand times. <HI>Miranda</HI> was so much overjoy'd,
that she both cry'd and laugh'd, embraced one, and
talk'd to another, thank'd the King, and ask'd for
the Captain of the Guards, to whom she was ob∣liged
for all; and being told that he was dead, was
very much grieved thereat. When they were at the
Table, the King desired to hear what had happen'd to
her from the Day whereon those fatal Orders were
given; which she acquiescing with, related her whole
Story, without omitting the least Circumstance.
But while she was thus engag'd with the King and
her Sisters, the time of her Return was elaps'd,
and the amorous Ram became so uneasy, that he
was no longer Master of himself; and seeing that
she came not again, said to himself, “My unhappy
Form of a Sheep is displeasing to her; alas! too
unfortunate Lover, what shall I do without <HI>Mi∣randa?
Ragotte,</HI> inhuman Fairy, how great is thy
Revenge for my Indifference towards thee?” Com∣plaining
in this manner, and seeing Night approach∣ing,
without any Appearance of his Princess's com∣ing,
he ran to the Palace, and ask'd for <HI>Miranda:</HI>
but as every body had heard of his Adventure, and
were unwilling that the Princess should go back
again with him, they refused him the sight of her
in so rude a manner, that he fetch'd Sighs, and
made Complaints capable of piercing the Hearts of
all that heard him, except the Soldiers that kept the
Gates; and at last, overcome with his Grief, laid
himself down and died.</P>
<P>The King, who knew nothing of this deep Tra∣gedy,
prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed to his Daughter to ride in a Cha∣riot
through all the Streets of the City, to shew
her to her Subjects; but what a dismal Sight was
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
it to her, when they got out of the Gates of the
Palace, to see her dear Sheep stretch'd out on the
Ground, void of Life? She jump'd with precipitation
out of the Chariot, ran to him, cry'd over him, and
bemoan'd the Death of the Royal Ram, which she
knew was owing to her not being so good as her
Word, and in her Despair thought to have partook
of his Fate.</P>
<P>Thus we see, that the greatest Persons, as well as
others, are subject to the Strokes of Fortune, and
sometimes undergo the heaviest Calamities, when
they think themselves at the height of their Desires.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>DONNA <HI>Juana,</HI> who was well read in Ro∣mances,
and never was in a better humour,
gave great Applauses to this Story of Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s,
pitying the unhappy Ram, and blaming <HI>Miranda</HI> for
her Neglect; but as it was then time for her to
think of dressing, she took her leave of them,
and retired, and consulted all the Glasses in her
Apartment with greater Attention than ever. After
she had dressed herself, she ran into her Nieces
Chamber, and finding them in bed, said to them,
“Fie! what lazy Creatures are you! I have been
visiting the Pilgrims already this Morning, and
have heard one of the prettiest Stories in the
world, and have besides been fifty times all up
and down the House; had you had any Charity,
you would have follow'd my Example, and not
have slept out your Eyes, as you have done: see
how lively and how broad awake mine are!” At
this, <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia</HI> had much ado to hold from
laughing, for Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s were so small, and
withal so hollow, that had they not been red and
inflamed, they would not have been easily seen:
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
but they keeping a strict Guard on their Actions,
told her their Heads ach'd, and that they did
not know whether they ought to go into those
Strangers Rooms again. “O! I see you are wea∣ry
of them already, <HI>reply'd Donna</HI> Juana, be∣cause
they are not fine Gentlemen; for my
part, I love them the better because they are
poor, since nothing can be more miserable than
for People to be at a distance from their own
Country, and to be robb'd and wounded by
Thieves, which pierces my very Heart: but to
make them amends, I'll make them stay here, to
teach you what my Brother desired you should
learn, and will give them as much Money as they
have lost, for their Trouble.”</P>
<P>“What, Madam, <HI>cry'd</HI> Isidora, will you keep Peo∣ple
that you don't know, who are, perhaps, great
Blockheads in their Profession, and may sooner
put us out in what we have learnt, than teach us
any more.” “You always oppose what I desire,
<HI>said Donna</HI> Juana <HI>in a Passion;</HI> I don't intend to pay
Masters to teach you against your wills, but give
me leave to learn myself; I shall take a great deal
of pleasure in singing an Air in a pretty easy man∣ner,
and in regaining what I have lost on my
Guittar: fifty Years ago I play'd very prettily,
and with a little pains I shall bring my Hand in
again, and then you will be glad to hear me.”
<HI>Isidora</HI> knowing her Aunt to be very covetous,
thought she had found out a sure way to send
these Pilgr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s away, by telling her nothing could
be more ridiculous than to see them in her Cham∣ber
singing and playing on Musick in leathern Jac∣kets,
with Hats of Sheils, and the Habits they were
in. “You would be very well pleased that they
should remain so, <HI>reply'd the Aunt,</HI> that you might
laugh at them; but your Brother has left two or
three Suits of Clothes behind, which will fit them
very well, and I design to give them to them.”
“My Brother, Madam, is not perhaps so charita∣ble
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
as you are, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia.” “So much the
worse for him, <HI>answer'd the old Lady hastily;</HI> there∣fore
it is my Duty to send him to Heaven if I
can, and the surest way is to do charitable Offices
at his Expence.” Upon this she went out, and
left her two Nieces together. “Alas! Sister, <HI>said
Melanthia,</HI> my Aunt has lost her Senses; can any
thing be more ridiculous, than for her to learn to
dance and sing at her Age? She must certainly be
in love with one of these Strangers, and that is
so prodigious, that I cannot but be amazed at it.”
“What must we do, Sister? <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora <HI>in a melan∣choly
Tone:</HI> 'tis our ill Fortune is the cause of it;
had we no Interest in this Affair, she would have
been quite the Reverse of what she is now: in
short, we must call up all our Courage to our
aid.”</P>
<P>While they were dressing, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was en∣gaged
with the Count, who was for getting up, and
eating something more solid than the Chicken-Broth
she had brought, with cooling and purging
Herbs that were in it; which put him out of all
patience, and made him say to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> in a
little Heat, “If the sympathetick Powder cures me
not to-day, I shall certainly run mad.” Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> seeing him so angry, began to be a little
cholerick in her turn, and told him he would not
easily recover; that she foresaw a malignant Fever;
that the Vivacity of his Eyes was a sure Token of
it; that in all appearance he had a mind to die;
and that since she had clear'd her Conscience, he
might chuse whether he would purge or no. By
her grave Air he soon perceived that she was dis∣pleased,
and answer'd, That far from being willing
to die, he never had a greater Desire to live; that
since she vouchsafed to interest herself in his Life,
he wish'd to recover, that he might pay her his Ac∣knowledgments,
and declare her Generosity where∣ever
he went. Thus he appeased the kind old La∣dy,
who, to shew him that she would give him no∣thing
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
thing she would not take herself, sipped up the
Broth before his face; which had so quick an Effect
upon her, that soon after she was obliged to leave
them, and return to her own Chamber.</P>
<P>“Alas! <HI>cry'd the Count, as soon as she was gone,</HI> was
ever any Misfortune equal to mine, to be thus ex∣posed
to all these Caprices? if they last, and you
become not the Object in your turn, I shall de∣spair.”
“Poor Cousin, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>laugh∣ing,</HI>
you have experienced how much the Lady in∣terests
herself more in you than me: but sincere∣ly
now, would you have been so sick, had you
sipped the Broth composed of those purgative
Medicines?” “Composed of the Devil and all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Imps! <HI>said the Court in a Passion;</HI> I protest to you,
if I had not seen <HI>Melanthia,</HI> and desired not to see
her again, you might have said and done by your∣self
if you would, for I would have abandon'd you
in your Enterprize. Alas! <HI>continued he,</HI> I spoke
too prophetically, when I said that this Castle was
inhabited by a Fairy; but I added, that we drove
her away, and now I find for my Sins we keep
her.” “You make sad Complaints, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ga∣briel;
be satisfied, I give you my word, my Pow∣der
of Sympathy shall heal your Wound up so
well this Night, that the Scar shall not be seen.”
I wish to Heaven, <HI>cry'd the Count,</HI> that you could
cure the Wounds of the Heart so well, for I must
tell you again, that which I receiv'd last Night is
deep, and will be a long time before it is well.”
Oh now I love you! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, for owning
your Defeat so frankly; you know by Experience,
that I have sometimes deserved your Pity, when
you have deny'd it me.”</P>
<P>Dinner being ready, and Donna <HI>Juana</HI> finding
herself not in a Condition to go into the Pilgrims
Room; but as her Apprehension, lest her Patient
should eat too much, made her more uneasy than
her Physick, she sent for her two Nieces, to order
them to take care of him: “Stir not out of the
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
Room, <HI>said she,</HI> while his Brother is at Dinner.”
“But, Madam, <HI>answer'd</HI> Isidora, 'tis improper for us
to take these Charges upon us; we'll call your
Almoner, if you please.” “What! <HI>cry'd</HI> Juana, are
you always thwarting me? Have you no Charity
for the Poor, no Goodness towards Strangers, no
Obedience to your Aunt?” Upon that she flew
into so great a Passion, that her Nieces ran away,
and never stay'd to hear what she had to say to
them. When they had got into a Gallery, that they
were to cross to go to their own Room, they stop'd,
and looking at each other in a melancholy Air, <HI>Isi∣dora</HI>
said to her Sister, “What Whims were ever
like these of my Aunt, to be thus bent upon fore∣ing
us to see these Strangers, who appear so dan∣gerous
to us? Were they Men of Birth and E∣states,
that had any Love for us, she would hide
us in a Cellar.” “But, Sister, <HI>interrupted</HI> Melan∣thia,
what she does is without any design of ex∣posing
our Hearts, I am sure she would be in the
utmost despair to find ours in the same road with
hers; she thinks we are only made to observe her
Inclinations: she loves Don <HI>Estevus,</HI> and would
learn to sing and play on the Guittar, and was
it not for the Chagrin that hangs about us, we
should almost kill ourselves with laughing.” “What
you say is very true, <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora; but how shall
we resist the Merits of these Strangers?” “We
must always think them beneath us, <HI>continued</HI> Me∣lanthia;
that it is impossible for our Hearts to be
made for each other; and that it is better to die,
than to have wherewithal to reproach ourselves
for.” And at that instant they thought themselves
so well fortify'd against their own Inclinations, that
they went boldly into the Pilgrims Chamber.</P>
<P>The Count lay in Bed more like a Man of Quality
than a poor Traveller, his Linen was so very fine;
for they had put up clean Linen and other Necessaries
in a little Cloke-Bag they had brought along with
them: and as Musicians are very much conversant
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
with Persons of Quality, and generally dress well; he
had fine Lace at his Hands, and his Neck and Sleeve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were tied with cherry-colour'd Ribbons: and for
Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had also pull'd off his Pilgrims Cap
and comb'd out his Hair, which was very beautiful
he seem'd as worthy of Attention as his Cousin
Though <HI>Isidora</HI> and her Sister were follow'd by
their Women, and had order'd the Almoner to
come after them, yet were they very much emba∣rass'd,
to find themselves in a Chamber with two
Men who were not near Relations, which is an
extraordinary thing in <HI>Spain;</HI> having only their
Aunt's Maggots to give a gloss to this Act of theirs.
<HI>Melanthia</HI> told the Count smiling, “That Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> was so much concern'd for his Health, that
she had given her orders to starve him, and that she
came Express to hinder him from eating.” “Donna
<HI>Juana, reply'd he,</HI> (looking on her with all tender∣ness
and respect imaginable) will easily prevent
my eating, by sending you to forbid me; but,
Madam, I doubt by seeing you whether my
Health can be now assurd.” “For my part, <HI>said
Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>to</HI> Isidora, I find so much Compassion
for sick Persons, that I should not be afraid of
being ill my self.” “Do you find in yourself any
Disposition towards being so, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia,
(with some smartness.)” “Yes, Madam, <HI>answer'd he,</HI>
I have a continual Uneasiness and Pain at my
Heart.” “How unseasonable is this, <HI>added</HI> Isidora,
for we hoped you would sing us one of those
Airs which entertain'd us so agreeably last Night.”
“Ah, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> I'll do all that lies in my
power to obey you, 'tis enough that you com∣mand
me any thing.” “But, <HI>said she,</HI> shall not we
hear by and by Don. <HI>Estevus</HI> tune his Harp to your
Voice.” “In the Evening, Madam, <HI>said the Count;</HI>
for then my Wound will be better, and then I
may venture to rise.” “'Tis now Dinner-time,
<HI>said</HI> Melanthia, and as soon as you have din'd, we
shall retire.” “What, Madam, <HI>said the Count, in∣terrupting
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
her,</HI> must we live all this day without
seeing you? I declare to you, I shall not be able
to perform in the Evening what I have promis'd.”
“Unless, <HI>answer'd</HI> Isidora, it enters into Donna
<HI>Juana</HI>'s head to send us here again, I suppose we
shall not come any more.” At that instant Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Dinner was set before him; but he was so
taken up with the Pleasure of looking and hearing
her whom he lov'd, that he had lost his Stomach.
Donna <HI>Melanthia</HI> press'd him to eat, and <HI>Isidora</HI> kept
talking with the Count, till they bethought them∣selves
that they hinder'd Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> from eating
his Dinner, and the Count from rising; and as
they were not so great Admirers of fasting as their
Aunt, but thought the sick Person might want some
Nourishment, they retir'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Juana,</HI> who never had them
out of her Thoughts, sent her Nephew's Clothes,
which he had made a Campaign in, and were after
the <HI>French</HI> Mode. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count made
no difficulty to put them on: but laughing in their
sleeves, said to one another, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> must be a
Conjurer to know that we are in his Clothes and
in his Apartment; and diverted themselves some
time after this manner: when Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> chang∣ing
the Discourse, all on a sudden, said, “Have
you observ'd with what Indifference the beautiful
<HI>Isidora</HI> treats me? she almost disdains to answer
me, and I have surpriz'd her Eyes twice or thrice
fix'd in so obliging a manner on you, that I should
think my self too happy, had I had that good
Fortune.” “This is a pure Vision, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI>
but I can assure you that Donna <HI>Melanthia</HI>'s look∣ing
at you as much as you believe <HI>Isidora</HI> look'd at
me, is not one; for she prais'd your Voice, even
to an Exaggeration, and admires all that you say.”
“Ah! Cousin, I am afraid you have made here
two Conquests for one.” “I have a better Opi∣nion
of my self than you, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
for I own that she seems to shew me some Fa∣vour,
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
but <HI>Isidora</HI> recompences you with Usury.” “I
conclude from thence, <HI>said the Count,</HI> that our not
being so agreeable to one another may be an hin∣drance
to the Progress we might otherwise have
made in this time.” “But there's one thing trou∣bles
me, <HI>added Don</HI> Gabriel, which is, your fancy∣ing
to be well to-night, will oblige us to be gone
to-morrow, for what pretence can we make to
stay?” “I'll assure you, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> I don't
intend to expose myself any longer to the impor∣tunate
Charity of <HI>Juana:</HI> for I am persuaded that
if she had starv'd you, and doctor'd you up with
Chicken-Broth as she has me, you would not have
borne jesting with any more than me.” “And you
say that you are sensible of <HI>Melanthia</HI>'s Charms,
<HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, (looking earnestly at him) Good
God! how weak is your Passion.” “I am infi∣nitely
taken with that amiable Person, <HI>reply'd the
Count,</HI> if I could flatter my self with pleasing her:
but I must confess, whatever kindness she may
shew me, I cannot keep my Bed any longer;
take you your turn now, cry out heartily, and
complain of a Pain in your Side, I'll say 'tis a
Pleurisy, and Donna <HI>Juana</HI> will bleed you to death.”
As vex'd as Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was, he could not forbear
laughing at this Imagination: “I have need of all
my Strength, to support the Coldness of <HI>Isidora,
said he.</HI>” “And for my part, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> I'll
go to dinner and recruit mine.” Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> bore
him company, and both eat more like hungry
Travellers than Men in love.</P>
<P>The two Sisters went into Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Cham∣ber
to pay their Respects to her, and to let her
know how the Pilgrims did; as to her own state
of Health, she was somewhat better, having en∣dur'd
a great deal all the Morning, and told them,
“That if the Powder of Sympathy had such strange
Effects, as to enable a wounded Person to rise so
soon, she wou'd never be without it, but would
use it in all Distempers, and get the Secret, both
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
for her own sake and all her Friends.” “But, <HI>conti∣nu'd
she,</HI> do you think this poor wounded Crea∣ture
will be able to come into my Chamber in
the Evening?” “I don't doubt it in the least,
Madam, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia, for he looks extraor∣dinary
well, and I am much deceiv'd if they
will not give us a Concert to divert you.” “How
happy am I, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> that Chance brought them
to this House; they have had such good Usage,
that they will have reason to speak well of us
where-ever they go.”</P>
<P>The Neices went afterwards to their own A∣partments,
and after they had din'd, shut themselves
up, that they might talk together with the more
Freedom. “Tell me what News you have, <HI>said</HI>
Melanthia; how stand you? are you strong or
weak?” “I am the most unhappy Person in the
World, <HI>said</HI> Isidora, to have neither Anger nor
Shame enough to hate a Man that would di∣sturb
my Quiet. You observ'd, <HI>continu'd she,</HI>
that I spoke but little, but was altogether given
up to Thought; I examin'd my Sentiments, and
—I'll say no more.” There she left off, and
<HI>Melanthia</HI> look'd at her a long time without mak∣ing
any reply; when <HI>Isidora</HI> said again, “Don't you
pity me?” “Whatever Compassion I may have for
you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia, it cannot equal that I have
for my self; for I am more sensible of the great∣ness
of my Misfortune, and believe you have
more Resolution.” “Alas! Sister, <HI>cry'd</HI> Isidora,
what signifies Resolution, when it combats with
our Inclinations?” “But, <HI>added</HI> Melanthia, don't
you think these Strangers will be over-joy'd to
stay here.” “Their Fortune is so low, <HI>said</HI> Isi∣dora,
that I should not be at all surpriz'd at it.”
“I know not whether they are rich or not, <HI>con∣tinu'd</HI>
Melanthia, but certain I am, that were we
to judge of them by their Persons and Wit, we
should rather take them to be Men of Quality
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
than ordinary Persons.” “Let us have none of your
Visions, <HI>said</HI> Isidora, (interrupting her Sister) they
are no otherwise than Musicians, and have told
us so themselves, and I admire them the more
for their Sincerity.” “I protest, <HI>answer'd</HI> Melan∣thia,
I cannot believe it, this is not the first time
that People have conceal'd their Birth.” “No,
<HI>said her Sister,</HI> they are more apt to boast of it,
and seldom pretend to be of a mean Extract when
they are really Gentlemen.”</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana</HI> being somewhat better, sent to
know whether the Pilgrims, if Don <HI>Estevus</HI> was
able, would come to see her, and alarm'd them
both with this Compliment. “I am afraid, <HI>said
Don</HI> Gabriel, that it is to dismiss us, and I have
a great mind to lay my self upon the Bed.” “Oh,
'tis now too late, <HI>reply'd the Count smiling;</HI> but there's
no danger of that, for 'tis unlikely that after ha∣ving
found my Pulse intermitting last Night, she
should turn us out of doors to-day; and I am
very much mistaken if she has not some Inclina∣tion
for one of us. Having thus encourag'd Don
<HI>Gabriel,</HI> he obey'd the Messenger, and went very
carefully, as he said, lest he should break open
his Wound.” As soon as Donna <HI>Juana</HI> saw them,
she put on an Air of Gayety that surpriz'd all the
Servants that stood by, made them sit by her,
whatever Excuses they made to the contrary, and
desir'd them to do her the Favour to give her a
Song. The Count who was willing to acquit him∣self
as well as Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> seeing a Harp hanging
in a Corner of the Room, ask'd Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
leave to play upon it; whereupon she seem'd over∣joy'd
and sent for her Neices; who were no sooner
come, but the Count began to sing these Words,
which he had made on purpose to raise the Pity of
the compassionate <HI>Juana.</HI></P>

</LG>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was transported with Ad∣miration
to hear the young Musician sing so well,
and to understand that he was a Poet too, inter∣rupted
him here, and cry'd, “By St. <HI>James</HI> the Pa∣tron
of <HI>Spain,</HI> you need not now be afraid of
Rogues, you are in a good House, and shall not
go soon; and when you do go, you shall have a
Guard large enough to secure you from all Dan∣gers.”
At these Words the two Pilgrims bow'd,
and return'd her a thousand Thanks, and she de∣sir'd
them to proceed in their Concert: and 'tis
probable that the young Ladies being so much pre∣possess'd
in their favour, heard them with a great
deal of Pleasure; yet had they not all the Sa∣tisfaction
imaginable, since there was no Intelli∣gence
with their Eyes and Sighs. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> fix'd
his Eyes on none but <HI>Isidora,</HI> while she turn'd hers
towards the Count, who gaz'd on <HI>Melanthia</HI> with
unexpressible Pleasure, who bent her Thoughts
entirely upon Don <HI>Gabriel;</HI> and for Donna <HI>Juana,</HI>
she praised the Count, and persecuted him conti∣nually,
when it was not in his power to say the
least obliging thing to her. Nevertheless, she flat∣ter'd
herself as much as any of them, believing
that it proceeded from Respect, and that he durst
not give way to the Emotions of his Heart; and
for our two Lovers, who were not deceived in
their Suspicions, they were very much dissatisfied.
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
When they had done singing, she ask'd them, “ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
they would learn her to play upon some Instruments
and may be, <HI>continu'd she,</HI> I may learn to dane<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

me above these thirty Years: don't think
that I am disheartned, I will keep you twent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Years if I can.” Whereupon they told her, “She
did them too much Honour, that they should
be very happy if they were to spend their whole
Lives in her Service; but before they engage'd
themselves, desir'd leave to write to their Fa∣ther
to know his Pleasure:” which she, far from
opposing, rather commended them for, and taking<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Guittar, and tuning it with her lean shrivel'd Hands,
her Fingers trembled so much when she struck the
Strings, that they had all much ado to keep from
an extravagant Laughter. But for the Count, whom
she had made choice of for her Master, his Gayety
was all laid aside when he thought of the Indif∣ference
of <HI>Melanthia.</HI> When the two Pilgrims had
made an end of their Concert, they retir'd because
it was late, and the two young Ladies went to
their own Apartments.</P>
<P><HI>Isidora</HI> seeing her Sister in a deep Melancholy,
said to her, “I ask you not, dear <HI>Melanthia,</HI> what
ails you, I judge of your Condition by my own;
we are both in love, and to compleat our Mis∣fortunes,
meet with no Returns from these Stran∣gers.”
“I cannot believe them insensible, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Melanthia, but a strange Fatality governs their
Hearts as well as ours; we love not him that love
us, but him that loves us not.” “You are in the
right, Sister, <HI>interrupted</HI> Isidora, we despise each
other's Heart; but ought we to be sorry for this
Accident? it may be the only means to cure us.
Had their Inclinations answer'd our Esteem, we
should have had greater Conflicts, whereas now
we may say to each other, let us not value these
ungrateful Men.” “Why call ye them so, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Melanthia, they ought rather to be pity'd than
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
blam'd, but it may be their Policy to use us thus.”
“Prudence seems to me to be quite out of play,
<HI>said</HI> Isidora, they must have a great deal to disco∣ver
no Passion; but if they would declare it, by
what Motives do they betray their Thoughts?”
“No, no, my Dear, 'tis all a mistake, Don <HI>Estevus</HI>
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es you, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> me; and for my Aunt,
she is my Rival, I never saw any one roll their
Eyes about as she has done to-night; I thought
sometimes that she was going into Convulsions.”
“Well, <HI>cry'd</HI> Melanthia, <HI>after having mused some time,</HI>
let Rage perform what Pride was incapable of;
since these Strangers know not how to love as they
ought, let us avoid them without tormenting our∣selves.”
<HI>Isidora</HI> agreed to it, and they were both of
a mind, and nothing was wanting but the Power.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count for their parts com∣plain'd
as much of their Destiny, esteeming them∣selves
nevertheless happy in gaining the Attention of
<HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia;</HI> but were not for being Rivals,
nor changing the first Object. “Am not I well re∣warded,
<HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, for my Passion for <HI>Isidora?</HI>
when I look at her she casts her Eyes on you, and
seems to demand Satisfaction for the Liberty I
take.” “<HI>Melanthia</HI>'s Carriage is the same, <HI>reply'd
the Count,</HI> I have never receiv'd the least Civility
from her; but for her Aunt, you have seen how
gracious she is to me.” “Oh! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel,
you are very much favour'd in her Eyes, but it
is not in her power to comfort you.” “It adds
to my Grief, <HI>answer'd the Count,</HI> to bear it all alone,
for I shall be always oblig'd to shew her some
Complaisance, which will not be very agreeable
when I have my Head full of Disquiers.” Thus
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count spent many Days, with∣out
venturing to declare their Sentiments to <HI>Isidora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia.</HI> “I should have spoke before now,
<HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>one day to his Cousin,</HI> if I could en∣tertain
any Hopes from my Confession; but I see
too well, that I am not beloved by her I love.”
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
“I, for my part, can say nothing, <HI>answer'd the Court;
Melanth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>'s Indifference is so great, that I can pro∣mise
myself nothing from the Person I represent:
a Musician is not a Match for a young Lady of
Quality and Worth: why will you conceal your∣self
so long? Let us inform them of our Birth, it
may be they will treat us mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e favourable.”
“What, <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swer'd Don</HI> Gabriel, would you, to add
to our ill Fortune, have us deny'd by our own
Names?” “What, you set a greater Value by
your Name than your Heart, <HI>reply'd the Count smar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ly,</HI>
since you have a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egard to the one
than the other; but you shall have your own way,
since I pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mised to be guided by you, but you
must bring us off with Honour.” “My I ears are
great, and Hopes but small, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel; and
tho you are very serviceable to me, yet I would
give half I am worth in the World that you was
not with me.” “I wish to Heaven, <HI>cry'd the Count,</HI>
that I was at quiet, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Heart was at ease, I
should not be in haste to be in love again.” As
he pronounced these words somewhat louder than
ordinary, and heard a Noise, he was afraid some∣body
was listening, and looking towards the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
was surprized to see Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who put her
Finger upon her Mouth, and made a sign for him
to follow her into the Gallery. It was easy to per∣ceive
by her Countenance, that something extraor∣dinary
agitated her Mind; and the Count, who
then was sensible how dear <HI>Melanthia</HI> was to him,
began to be afraid Donna <HI>Juana</HI> had heard him,
and would oblige him to go away, which so per∣plex'd
him, that he thought twenty times to accuse
and discover himself: when she, taking upon her
the Discourse, said, “You are in love, Don <HI>Estevus,</HI>
and I am not surprized that you have not consult∣ed
your Reason, and that the Inequality between
the Person you love and yourself, deter'd you
not, considering you are at an Age when Ambi∣tion
is very prevalent; but why did you trust
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
your Brother with an Affair, that you ought to
conceal from every body?” Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s man∣ner
of speaking seem'd so obliging, and so much
the Reverse of what it would have been, had she
known her Neice was the Object of that Passion,
that he seem'd to doubt whether or no she had
heard all; and being loth to contribute to his own
Guilt, fetch'd a deep Sigh, and return'd no other
Answer. “I understand but too much by that Sigh,
<HI>continued she, composing herself;</HI> it ought to make me
angry with you, if I was capable of being so:
but in short, what Views can you have? One of
my Birth and Rank cannot marry a Man so much
beneath her.”</P>
<P>Tho the Count had put on the most serious Air ima∣ginable,
yet when he understood what she aim'd at,
he had much ado to keep his Countenance: “The
Sentiments of the Heart, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> depend
not always upon ourselves; I know too well what
my Misfortune has brought me to: I must die, that
is the only Remedy I can expect.” “You can ex∣pect
no other, <HI>said she, looking at him with her little
F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-Eyes;</HI> indeed you move my Compassion, and
I am too much concer'd not to—” And
was going to explain herself in his favour, when
<HI>Melanthia</HI> came in, who perceiving the Count with
her Aunt, was for withdrawing; but <HI>Juana</HI> calling
her, said, “Come and hear the Story which I pro∣mised
you t'other day; I was learnt it by an old
<HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an</HI> Slave, who could tell a thousand Stories
of that famous <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> so celebrated in all the
Eastern Countries, who was respected like ano∣ther
<HI>Aesop:</HI> the Characte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are to very p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, that

Go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernants, than for People of Delicacy; but I
am not to be persuaded but that there is some Art
in this Plainness, and have known Persons, of very
good Taste and Judgment, who have made them
their Amusements.” “Madam, I am not at all
surprized at that, <HI>said the Count;</HI> Wit delights in
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
Variety; they that would not read these Stories,
or hear them told, must be ridiculous; and they
who propose them as grave Subjects, shew their
want of Judgment; and those who would write,
or tell them in a lofty high-flown Stile, rob
them of their proper Character: but for my
part, I think they are very pretty to divert after
serious Business.” “In my opinion, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia,
they should be neither too elevated, nor too low,
but should enjoy a Mediocrity, and should be ra∣ther
merry than serious, and conclude with some
sort of a Moral.” “This which I am going to tell
you, <HI>said</HI> Juana, is very plain, but withal very
pretty, which you shall value as you like it; but
I can assure you, the Person that made it, is capa∣ble
of greater things.”</P>

<HEAD>The Story of Finetta the Cinder-Girl.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time ago there lived a King and a Queen,
who had managed their Affairs so ill, that they
were driven out of their Dominions; and to sup∣port
themselves, were forced to sell, first, their
Crowns, then their Robes, Linen and Laces, and
afterwards all they had: and when they were re∣duced
to the utmost Poverty, the King said to the
Queen, “We are forced out of our Kingdoms, and
have nothing left, therefore we must think of get∣ting
a Livelihood both for ourselves and Children;
think a little what we shall do, for my part, I
am entirely at a loss.” The Queen, who was a
Woman of good Sense and Wit, ask'd eight days
time to consider of it; and when they were ex∣pired,
said to him, “Come, don't let us vex and
torment ourselves, you shall lay Nets and Snares
for Fowls, and Lines for Fish, while I make them:
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
as for our Daughters, they are three proud idle
Sluts, and fancy themselves still to be great La∣dies,
we will carry them a great way off, that it
will be impossible for them to find their way back
again, for we can never keep them as fine as they
expect we should.”</P>
<P>The King, who was a kind Father, began to
weep when he saw he must part with his Children;
but the Queen being of an imperious haughty Tem∣per,
and he being forced to acquiesce with her,
he told her she might rise early the next Morning,
and carry her Daughters where she thought fit.
While they were thus contriving this Affair, the
Princess <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was the youngest of the three,
heard them thro the Key-hole, and as soon as she
was inform'd of their Design, ran as fast as she was
able to a large Grotto, inhabited by the Fairy <HI>Mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucha,</HI>
her God-mother; but before she went, took
two Pounds of fresh Butter, Eggs, Milk, and Flow∣er,
to make a Cake of, that she might be the more
acceptable Guest. When she first set out, she went
very chearfully, but after she had walked some
time, and the Soles of her Shoes were worn away,
and her Feet began to be gall'd with the Pebbles,
she was so weary, that she sat herself down on the
Grass, and fell a crying: when a fine <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse
passed by ready bridled and saddled, with Diamonds
enough on his Housings to buy two or three Towns;
who when he saw the Princess, he fed by her,
bending his Knees, seeming to pay some respect to
her, whereupon taking him by the Bridle, she said,
“Pretty Horse, if you will carry me to my God∣mother
the Fairy, I should be very much obliged
to thee, for I am so weary, that I am ready to
die away: I promise you, I'll give you good Corn
and Hay, and litter you down with clean Straw.”
The Horse bent down before her, and she jumping
upon his Back, he carry'd her to the Fairy's Grotto
as swift as a Bird flies in the Air: for <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlucha</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
knowing of her God-daughter's coming, had sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him for that purpose.</P>
<P>When she went in, she made three low Curte∣sies,
kiss'd the Hem of her Garment, and then sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to her, “Good-morrow, God-mother; how do yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
do? I have brought you here some Milk, Butter,
Flower, and Eggs, to make a Cake after ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Country Fashion.” “You are welcome, <HI>Finetta▪
said the Fairy;</HI> come, and let me embrace you.”
Whereupon she kiss'd her two or three times, which
made <HI>Finetta</HI> ready to die with Joy, for <HI>Merlucha</HI>
was a great and renown'd Fairy. “Well, my Girl,
<HI>said she,</HI> you shall be my Waiting-Woman, come
dress and comb my Head;” (which the Princess
did with all the Address imaginable.) “I know
what brought you hither, <HI>said</HI> Merlucha; you
heard the King and Queen consulting how they
might lose you, and you have no mind to be so
served. Take this Clue of Thred, it will not
break, and fasten one end of it to the Door of
your House, and keep the other in your Hand;
when the Queen leaves you, it will be an easy
matter for you, by this Thred, to find your way
back again.”</P>
<P>The Princess thank'd her God-mother, who gave
her a Sack full of Clothes, all cover'd over with
Gold and Silver, and embracing her, set her upon
the same Horse again, who carried her home in a
moment or two; and when she had thank'd her
pretty Horse for his Trouble, and had bid him re∣turn,
she went softly into the House, and hiding
her Sack under the Bed, laid herself down, without
taking any notice of what had pass'd. As soon as
it was Day, the King awaken'd his Wife, and bid
her prepare for her Journey; upon which she got
up, and put on a Pair of strong Shoes, a short Pet∣ticoat,
and white Waistcoat, and taking a Stick in
her hand, went to call her Daughters; the Eldest
of which was named <HI>Love's-F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> the Second <HI>Fair-Night,</HI>
and the Youngest <HI>Auricula,</HI> or <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne-Ear,</HI> but by
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
way of Nick-name <HI>Finetta.</HI> “I have dreamt to-night,
<HI>said the Queen,</HI> that we must go and see my Sister,
where we shall be treated, and be very merry.”
“We'll go, Madam, where you please, <HI>said</HI> Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e's-Flower,
(who could not endure to live in a Desart,)
so that we go, but 'tis no matter where.” The other
two said the same, and taking their leave of their,
Father, they all four set forward on their Journey.”
They went at last so far, that <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne-Ear</HI> began to
fear lest her Clue should not hold out, for they
had gone a great many score Miles; however, she
always behind her fastening her Thred in the Bri∣ars.
When the Queen thought she had carried
them so far, that they could not find their way
back again, she went into a large Wood, and said
to them, “Come, my little Lambs, lie down and
take a Nap, while I, like a Shepherdess, will
watch you, lest the Wolf should surprize you.”
Whereupon they laid themselves down, and fell a∣sleep,
and the Queen, when she thought them fast,
took her leave, as she thought, for the last time;
when <HI>Finetta,</HI> who only shut her Eyes, and pre∣tended
Sleep, said to herself, “Was I now of a re∣vengeful
Temper, I should leave my Sisters to pe∣rish
here, for they have beat and abused me very
much; but however, I will not now forsake them.”
Whereupon awakening them, she told them the
whole Story; at which they fell a crying, and beg∣ged
of her to take them along with her, promising
to give her all the fine things they had. “I know,
<HI>said</HI> Finetta, you will not perform what you pro∣mise;
but nevertheless, I shall act the Part of a
kind Sister.” And thereupon she rose up, and fol∣low'd
her Thred, which brought them home almost
as soon as the Queen.</P>
<P>When they came there, stopping a moment at the
Door, they heard the King say, “My Heart aches
to see you all alone.” “Indeed, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> we
were very much troubled with our Daughters.”
“Well, <HI>said the King,</HI> had you but brought my <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣netta</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
back, I should not be so much concern'd for
the other two.” And just then they knock'd at the
Door: “Who's there?” <HI>said the King.</HI> “Your three
Daughters, <HI>Love's-Flower, Fair-Night,</HI> and <HI>Fine-Ear,</HI>”
<HI>reply'd they.</HI> And at that the Queen trembled, and
said, “Don't open the Door, for they are certainly
their Spirits; for 'tis impossible they should be re∣turn'd.”
The King, who was as great a Coward
as his Wife, said, “'Tis false, you are not my
Daughters.” Whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> reply'd, “Look
thro the Key-hole, Papa, and if I am not your
Daughter <HI>Finetta,</HI> I consent to be whip'd.” At that
the King did as she bid him, and knowing them,
open'd the Door.” The Queen seem'd to be very
glad to see them, pretending she came back for
something she had forgot, and design'd to have gone
to them again.</P>
<P><HI>Finetta,</HI> when all was over, ask'd her Sisters for
what they had promised her, who thereupon beat
her with their Distaffs, and told her, That it was
for her sake that the King was not sorry for them.
Afterwards she went to bed, but being not able to
sleep for the Blows and Bruises they had given her,
she heard the Queen say, she would carry them ano∣ther
way farther off, from whence she was assur'd
they would never return. Upon this she got up softly,
went into the Hen-house, and wrung off the Necks
of two Pullets and a Cockerel, which the Queen
had fed up to regale herself with; and putting them
into a Basket, set out to go to see her God-mother
again. She had not gone half a Mile, being in the
dark, and frighten'd out of her Wits, before she
heard the <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse whinying and prancing;
who no sooner came to her, but she mounted, and
was carried presently to her God-mother's. After
the usual Compliments, she presented her with the
Fowls, and desired her good Advice, for that the
Queen had sworn to carry them to the World's
End. <HI>Merlucha</HI> bid her not grieve herself, and gave
her a Sack full of Ashes to carry before her, to
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
sprinkle before her as she went along, telling her,
when she return'd, she needed but observe her
Footsteps, which would conduct her back again;
and withal charged her not to take her Sisters a∣long
with her, assuring her if she did, she never
would see her more. The Horse being ready, <HI>Fi∣netta</HI>
took her leave, and with it a great quantity
of Diamonds in a Box, which she put into her Poc∣ket.
A little before day the Queen call'd the Prin∣cesses
again, and told them, that the King was not
very well, and that she dreamt they must go all
four to gather some Herbs for him in a certain
Country, where they were excellent. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who suspected that their Mother's
main End in this Affair was to lose them, were
very much afflicted, but were notwithstanding, ob∣liged
to go. <HI>Finetta</HI> said not a word all the time,
but kept behind them, strewing her Ashes; and the
Queen being persuaded that they would never be
able to find the way back, for she had carried them
a great distance off, and observing them all asleep
one Evening, took that Opportunity to bid them
good-by. When it was Day, that <HI>Finetta</HI> perceiv'd
her Mother was gone, she awaken'd her Sisters, and
told them, the Queen was gone again, and had left
them to themselves. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI>
cry'd, and tore their Hair, and bear their Breasts;
when <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was a good-natur'd Girl, pi∣tied
them, and told them, tho her God-mother,
when she inform'd her how she should find the way
back, charged her not to take them along with
her, and said she never would see her more if she
did; “Yet, <HI>said she,</HI> I will venture this to preserve
my Sisters.” Whereupon they both fell upon her
Neck, and kissed her, and all three returned to∣gether.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were very much surprized
to see the Princesses again, and talk'd about it all
the Night; when <HI>Fine-Ear,</HI> who had not her Name
for nothing, heard them lay a new Plot, which the
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
Queen was to put in execution in the Morning,
and thereupon ran and awaken'd her Sisters and
acquainted them with it. Alas! <HI>said she,</HI> we are
“all lost, the Queen without dispute will carry us
and leave us in some Desart: for your sakes I have
disoblig'd my Godmother, and dare not go to her
as I us'd to do.” This News put them to their
wits-end, and made them say to one another,
What shall we do? “Oh! <HI>said</HI> Fair-Night, don't
let us trouble ourselves, there are others who
have as much Contrivance as the old <HI>Merlucha,</HI>
we need but to take some Pease along with us
and sow them, and we shall easily trace our way
back again.” Upon <HI>Love's-Flower's</HI> approving of this
Expedient, they put Pease in their Pockets; but
for <HI>Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-Ear,</HI> instead of Pease, she took her Sack of
fine Clothes and her Box of Jewels: and they were
all three ready against the Queen call'd. “I have
dream'd to-night, <HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, she,</HI> that there were three
Princes in a Country I need not name, waiting
to marry you, and I have a great mind to carry
you to see whether my Dream is true or not.”
The Queen went first, and the Princesses follow'd
after, sowing the Pease as they went along, never
disturbing themselves, but being satisfy'd that they
by that means would find their way home; when
one dark Night the Queen left them again and
went home to the King▪ both weary of so long
a Journey, and glad to have got rid of so great
a Charge.</P>
<P>The three Princesses slept till eleven a-clock
the next day, when <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>netta</HI> discover'd first the
Queen's Absence; and tho she was well provided,
could not forbear crying, but however, rely'd more
on the Fairy <HI>Merlucha,</HI> than the Abiltity of her Sisters.
“The Queen is gone, <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her Sisters,</HI> let us
follow her as fast as we can.” “Hold your
tongue, you Fool, <HI>reply'd</HI> Love's-Flower, we can
find the way when we please.” <HI>Finetta</HI> durst re∣tarn
no Answer; but when they wanted to go
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
home, they could find no tracings or appearance of
any Pease; for the Pidgeons, with which that Coun∣try
abounded, had eaten them up, which set them
all in Tears. After they had been two Days with∣out
eating, <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> ask'd her Sisters, if they had
nothing to eat; whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> said, she had
found an Acorn: which they would have had
from her, but she answer'd, “What signifies one
Acorn among three of us? let us set it, it may
grow to a large Tree, and be serviceable.” To
which they all consented, tho there was no likeli∣hood
of any Trees in that Country, where there
was nothing to be seen but Cabbages and Lettice,
which the Princesses liv'd on; for had they been
nice, they must have perish'd. They had no other
covering when they slept than the azure Skies,
and water'd their Acorn every Night and Morn∣ing,
which they perceiv'd grew apace. When it
was got to some size, <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> was for climbing
it, but it was too weak to bear her, as was like∣wise
<HI>Fair-N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght,</HI> but she was too heavy; where∣upon
<HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>netta</HI> try'd, and when she was up, her Sisters
ask'd her what she saw; she told them nothing.
“Alas, <HI>said</HI> Love's-Flower, this Oak is not yet tall
enough.” However, they kept watering of it,
and <HI>Finetta</HI> never fail'd to get up into it twice a
day; and one day when she was up, <HI>Fair-Night</HI> said
to <HI>Love's-F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower,</HI> “I have found a Sack which our Sister
has hid from us, what can there be in it?” “Oh,
<HI>said</HI> Love's-Flower, she told me she had some old
Laces.” “But I believe she has something better,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Fair-Night:” and being curious, open'd it,
and found some old Laces of the King and Queen's,
which serv'd only to cover the fine Clothes and
Jewels. “What a sly Slut is this, <HI>said sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> let us
take them away, and put some Pebbles in their
place: which the other agreeing to, <HI>Finetta</HI> came
down again without ever discovering the trick her
Sisters had play'd her; for she had no occasion to
dress in a Desart, all her Thoughts being em∣ploy'd
on her Oak.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71"/>
One Morning when she was up in it, and her
Sisters ask'd her as usual, what she discover'd, she
told them, she saw a House so beautiful, that she
could not describe it, that the Walls were of E∣meralds
and Rubies, and the Roof of Diamonds
set in Gold. “You tell Fibs, <HI>said they,</HI> it cannot
be so.” “Indeed it is, <HI>answer'd</HI> Finetta, come
and see yourselves, my Eyes are dazled with
the Splendour.” Whereupon <HI>Love</HI>'s-<HI>Flower</HI> climb'd
up, and when she saw the Castle, was amazed;
and for <HI>Fair-N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght,</HI> whose Curiousity did not fail to
prompt her to get up in her turn, she seem'd as
much overjoy'd as her Sisters. “We must, without
dispute, said they, go to this Palace; who knows
but we may meet with fine Princes that will think
themselves happy to marry us?” In this manner of
Discourse they pass'd away the whole Night, when
<HI>Love's-Flower</HI> perceiving <HI>Finetta</HI> asleep, said to <HI>Fair-Night,</HI>
“Let us dress ourselves in the Clothes <HI>Finetta</HI>
has brought along with her.” “The Thought's
very good, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fair-Night.” Whereupon they
got up and dress'd themselves, and made themselves
as fine as Gold, and Silver, and Jewels could do.</P>
<P><HI>Finetta,</HI> who knew not what her Sisters had
done, open'd her Sack with a design to dress her∣self;
but how great was her Surprize and Afflic∣tion,
when she found nothing but Flints and Stones?
and perceiving at that very juncture her two Sisters
as bright as the Sun in her Clothes, she cry'd, and
complain'd of their Treachery; who only laugh'd
at her. “How can you, <HI>said she to them,</HI> carry me
along with you to the Castle, without letting me
be dress'd as well as yourselves?” “We have but
Clothes enough for ourselves <HI>reply'd</HI> Love's-Flower,
and if thou importunest us thus, thou shalt feel
our Blows.” “But <HI>continu'd the other,</HI> they are my
own, my God-mother gave them to me, and you
have nothing to do with them.” “If you teaze
us any longer, <HI>said they,</HI> we'll kill you and bury
you, and no-body shall know what is become of
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
you.” Which struck such a awe upon poor <HI>Finetta,</HI>
that she durst not provoke them, but follow'd them
like their Servant-Maid at a distance. The nearer
they came to the House, the more wonderful it ap∣pear'd.
“I cannot but think, <HI>said they one to ano∣ther,</HI>
how we shall be diverted and entertain'd;
we shall eat at the King's Table, but for <HI>Finetta,</HI>
she shall wash the Dishes in the Kitchen: and if
we are ask'd who she is, let us not make the least
mention of her as our Sister, but say, she is a poor
Herds-Man's Daughter.” Which cast <HI>Finetta</HI> into
Despair, she being a Girl endow'd with Wit and
Beauty. When they arriv'd at the Gates of the
Castle, they knock'd very hard, and were let in by
a frightful old Woman: She was fifteen foot high
and thirty about, had but one Eye, and that plac'd
in the midst of her Forehead like a <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and as
large as five others; her Nose was flat, her Skin
black, and her Mouth so large that it was very
frightful. “Oh! unfortunate Creatures, <HI>said she,</HI>
what brought you hither? Do you know that this
is a Giant's Castle, who would eat you all up for
his Breakfast? But it is well he is not at home,
I am better than he, I will eat but one of you
at a time, and you will have the Comfort of liv∣ing
two or three days longer.” When they heard
the Giantess speak thus, they ran away as fast as
they could, thinking to save themselves, but she
strid as far at one step as they at five, and soon
caught them again; and taking one by the Hair of
the Head, and the others by the Arms and Necks,
threw them all together into a Cave, where there
was nought but Toads, Snakes, and the Bones of
devour'd Persons. And as she was then for eating
<HI>Finetta,</HI> and was only gone for some Oil and Vine∣gar,
the Giant came; but thinking to keep them
for herself, as a nice Bit, she put them under a
great Tub, where they had no light but through a
little hole.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="73"/>
The Giant, who was six times as big as his Wife,
when he spoke, made the House shake again, and
when he cough'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seem'd like Thunder; he had
but one large Eye, and his Hair was like Bristles;
he lean'd on a piece of Timber, which he used for
a Cane, and held a Basket in his Hand, out of
which he took fifteen little Children he had taken
away from their Parents, and swallow'd them like
poach'd Eggs. When the three Princesses beheld
this, they shudder'd, but durst not cry, for fear
they should be heard. The Giant said to his Wife,
“I smell some fresh Flesh, give it me.” “You al∣ways
fancy, <HI>said she,</HI> that you smell fresh Meat,
'tis nothing but some Sheep that are going by.”
“Oh! <HI>said the Giant,</HI> I am not to be deceived thus;
I am sure I smell fresh Flesh, and will look for
it.” “Ay do,” <HI>reply'd she:</HI> “And if I find any,
<HI>said he,</HI> that you have concealed from me, I'll cut
off your Head.” Frighted at this Menace, <HI>she said
to him,</HI> “Be not angry, my Dear, and I will tell you
the truth, I have got three young Girls, that
came here to-day, but 'tis pity to eat them, for
they know how to do every thing, and, as I am
old, will be very serviceable to me. You know
our House is very much our of order, our Bread
is not well baked, nor our Beer well brewed,
and I appear not so handsome since I have slaved
myself with working; they shall be our Servants,
therefore don't eat them now, but if you have
a great desire to them any other time, you shall
have them.” The Giant, with great reluctancy,
promised her not to eat them all three, but press'd
hard for two, which she opposing, he then desir'd
one of them; which she not acq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iescing with, af∣ter
great Disputes, he promised her not to eat
them: for she design'd, when he was gone abroad,
to feast herself with them, and to pretend they had
made their Escape.</P>
<P>The Giant order'd his Wife to bring them to him;
at which they, poor Creatures, were ready to die
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
with fear, but the Giantess encouraged them. When
he saw them, he ask'd them what they could do?
They answer'd, that they knew how to clean a
House, and sew, and spin, and made such Ragouts,
that all that tasted of them generally lick'd their
Plates clean; and that for making of Bread, Cakes,
and Patty-pans, they were famous. “Well, well,
<HI>said the Giant, who loved a dainty Bit,</HI> make good
your words; but, <HI>said he to</HI> Finetta, how do you
know when the Oven is hot enough?” “I lay
some Butter on it, Sir, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> and then taste
it with my Tongue.” Thereupon he order'd her
to heat the Oven; and the Princess made a terri∣ble
Fire, for, you must know, the Giant's Oven was
as large as a Stable, and he and his Wife devour'd
as much Bread as an Army; and the Giant, who
overlooked them, eat an hundred Cakes and Piggins
of Milk. <HI>Love's-F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer</HI> and <HI>Fair-N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght</HI> prepared the
Paste; the Giant said, the Oven was hot enough:
<HI>Finetta</HI> told him, she would see whether 'twas so,
and throwing some Pounds of Butter into the O∣ven's
Mouth, told him it must be tasted with the
Tongue, but that she was too little to do it. “Oh!
<HI>said he,</HI> I am big enough:” and thereupon he thrust
himself so far in, that he could not get back again,
but was burnt to Ashes.</P>
<P>When the Giant's Wife came to the Oven, she
was surprized to find such an heap of Ashes, as pro∣ceeded
from her burnt Husband. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and
<HI>Fair-N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght,</HI> who saw her very much grieved, did
what they could to comfort her; but at the same
time were afraid her Sorrow would be too soon o∣ver,
and her Appetite come upon her. “Madam, <HI>said
they,</HI> have Courage, some King or great Prince
will think themselves happy to marry you:” which
made her laugh, and shew her long Teeth, that
were as large as a Finger. When they saw her in
a good humour, <HI>Finetta</HI> said to her, “If you will
throw off those Bear-Skins, with which you now
clothe yourself, we will dress you a-la-mode, and
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
you shall appear as bright as any Star. “Let me
see, <HI>said she,</HI> what you would be at; but assure
yourself, if any Ladies look better than me, I
will make minc'd Meat of you.” Whereupon the
three Princesses pull'd off her Cap, and comb'd and
frizled her Hair; and while the two Sisters were
amusing her after that manner, <HI>Finetta</HI> with an
Hatchet sever'd her Head from her Body at one
Blow.</P>
<P>Never was Joy equal to theirs, they ran up to
the top of the House to ring the golden Bells, went
into all the Chambers of Pearls and Diamonds, the
Furniture of which was so rich, that it was an Ex∣tasy
of Pleasure to behold it; they laugh'd and sung
all that day long, and almost glutted themselves
with Sweetmeats and other Dainties. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> laid in Beds of Brocade and Velvet,
and said one to another, “Our Father never was
so rich in all his Prosperity, but yet we want Hus∣bands,
and may be assured no body will ever
come here, since this House passes for a Place of
Destruction; since the Giant's and his Wife's
Deaths are unknown, therefore we must go to
the next Village to shew ourselves in our Finery,
and we shall not be long before we find Persons
enough who will be glad to marry Princesses.”</P>
<P>As soon as they were dress'd, they told <HI>Finetta</HI>
they were going a walking, and that she must stay
there to take care of the House, and have every
thing in order against they return'd, or else they
should make her feel their Blows. When they
were gone, <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was forced to scour and
wash, was so overpower'd with Grief, that she burst
out a crying. “How unhappy was I, <HI>said she to
herself,</HI> to disobey my God-mother, all Misfortunes
have since attended me; my Sisters have robbed
me of my fine Clothes, and dress'd themselves in
them. Had it not been for me, the Giant and his
Wife had been yet alive; and what am I the bet∣ter
for their Deaths? I should have been as well
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
pleased to have been devoured by them, as to live
as I do now.” When she had said all this, she cry'd
so much, that her Eyes were almost swoln out of
her Head; and when her Sisters came home, she
had the mortification to see them bring with them
Oranges, and Sweetmeats, and fine Fruits, and to
hear them tell what Respect they had paid by a
King's Son at a Ball they had been at; and withal
to be bid to come and undress them, and lay up
their Clothes: which she durst not refuse, for if
ever she complain'd, they flew upon her, and beat
her till they left her for dead.</P>
<P>The next day they went again, and came back
as before, and lived in that manner some time;
when one night, as <HI>Finetta</HI> was sitting over an hand∣ful
of Fire, not knowing what to do with her∣self,
raking among the Cinders, she found an old
rusty, canker'd, little Key; and after having taken a
great deal of pains to scour it, found it to be Gold:
and thinking it might open some Lock in the House,
try'd them all, and it belong'd to a fine Box, which
she open'd, wherein there were rich Clothes, Dia∣monds,
Laces, fine Linen, Ribbons, and Things of
great Value. Never mentioning a word of this good
Fortune, she waited impatiently for her Sisters go∣ing
again the next day, and then as soon as she
saw them out of doors, dress'd herself so fine, that
she appear'd as glorious as the Sun, and went to
the same Ball; and tho she had no Mask on, yet
her Clothes had made so great an Alteration in her
for the better, that they did not know her. When
she appear'd in that Assembly, there was heard a
Murmuring of Voices, some out of Admiration, and
others of Jealousy; and when she danced, she ex∣celled
as much therein as in her Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who had made there
strange havock among the Hearts, seeing the fa∣vourable
Reception this Stranger met with, were
ready to burst with Jealousy; but <HI>Finetta,</HI> who be∣haved
herself extraordinary well, seem'd by her
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
Air as if she was made to command. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who had been used to see their Si∣ster
smutty and grimy, retain'd so small an Idea of
her Face, that they knew her not, but paid as
much respect to her as the rest; and she, as soon as
the Ball was over, ran home as fast as she could,
and put on her dirty Rags again. When her Sisters
came home, they told her they had seen a charm∣ing
young Princess, whose Skin was as white as
Snow, the Colour in her Cheeks as fresh as a Rose,
her Teeth as even and white as Ivory, and for her
Lips, they look'd like Coral, and that her Clothes
were all over Gold and Diamonds. This Sport con∣tinued
some time, and <HI>Finetta</HI> every Ball appeared
in a different Dress, for the Chest was inexhaustible,
and the Clothes were all so fashionable, that the
Ladies follow'd that Mode.</P>
<P>One night that <HI>Finetta</HI> had danced very much,
and had stayed longer than ordinary, and was wil∣ling
to get home soon enough, that she might not
be discover'd by her Sisters, she made so much
haste, that she lost her Slipper, which was of red
Velvet braided with Pearls, and was found the next
day by the Prince <HI>Chery,</HI> the King's eldest Son, as
he was hunting; who took it up, and admired it so
much for its Smallness, that he kiss'd it, and carried it
home with him, and from that day grew so melan∣choly
and reserved, that he never would speak, lost
his Stomach, fell away and look'd so ill, that the
King and Queen, who loved him to distraction,
sent for all the Remedies and Assistance they could
get; but all to no purpose, for the Physicians, after
they had consulted together, and made their Obser∣vations
for two or three days together, concluded
that he was in love, and would die, unless he had
some Relief.</P>
<P>The Queen, who doated on him, cry'd day and
night over him, but could make no discovery who
the beloved Person was; she brought all the most
beautiful Ladies of the Court into his Chamber,
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
but he would not so much as look at them. At
last the Queen said to him one day, “My dear Child,
you overwhelm us with Grief, we know you are
in love, wherefore then should you hide it from
us? tell us who the lovely Person is, and should
she prove a Shepherdess, we will not oppose your
Desires.” Hereupon the Prince, grown more bold
by the Queen's Promises, pull'd the Slipper from
under his Bolster; “This, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> is the
Cause of my Illness, I found this pretty little Slip∣per
as I was one day a hunting, and am resolved
never to marry any but the Person that can
draw it on.” “Alas! Child, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> grieve
not, we shall soon find her out.” And then she
left him, and told the King; who was very much
surprized at the Strangeness of his Passion, and or∣der'd
to be proclaim'd by Sound of Trumpet, That
all Women should come and try on the Slipper, and
that the Person whom it fitted should be married
to the Prince. Upon this all the fine Ladies of the
Court wash'd and pared their Feet, and made choice
of the thinnest Stockings, that they might put on
the Slipper; but all to no purpose, since none of
them could get it on: which was no small Affliction
to the Prince. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> upon this
dress'd themselves so fine one day, that <HI>Finetta</HI> was
amazed, and ask'd them, where they were going?
who told her, to Court, to try on the Slipper that
the King's Son had found, and that whoever suc∣ceeded,
was to marry him: whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> ask'd,
if she might not go, which made them laugh at
her, and tell her, they wonder'd how such a dirty
Girl as she could have any such Thoughts, bidding
her water the Garden, for she was fit for nothing
else.</P>
<P>When they were gone, <HI>Finetta</HI> had a great
mind to try her Fortune, having a strong fancy of
her Success, but was somewhat at a loss, because
she knew not the way; for the Ball she was at
before, was not kept at Court. However, she dres∣sed
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
herself very magnificent, her Gown was of
blue Sattin, cover'd over with Stars of Diamonds;
a full Moon was placed in the middle of her Back,
and a Sun upon her Head, which gave such a Lu∣stre,
as dazled the Eyes of the Spectators. When
she open'd the Door to go out, she was very much
surprized to find <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse there; she ca∣ress'd
him, and was overjoy'd to see him, and
mounting on him, appear'd a thousand times more
beautiful than <HI>Hele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The Horse went prancing a∣long,
and by the Noise he made with champing of
his Bits, made <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and her Sister look be∣hind
to see who was coming after them; but how
great was their Astonishment, when they saw it
was <HI>Finetta!</HI> “I protest, <HI>said</HI> Love's-Flower <HI>to</HI> Fair-Night,
'tis <HI>Finetta;</HI>” and the other was about mak∣ing
some Reply, when the Horse passing by, dash'd
them all over with Dirt: whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> told them,
that she despised them as they deserved, and so put
forward. “Certainly, <HI>said</HI> Fair-Night, we dream;
who could have furnished her with this Horse and
fine Clothes? 'tis a Miracle to me: she will without
dispute have the good-fortune to get on the Slipper,
therefore 'tis in vain for us to go any further.”</P>
<P>While they were in the utmost Rage and Despair,
<HI>Finetta</HI> arrived at the Palace, where she being ta∣ken
for a Queen, the Guards were under Arms,
with Drums beating and Trumpets sounding. She
went into the Prince's Chamber, who no sooner
set his Eyes on her, but he was charm'd, and wish'd
her Foot small enough to put on the Slipper; which
she not only did do, but also produced the Fellow
to it. Upon which all Persons present cry'd, <HI>Long
live the Princess;</HI> and the Prince arose from off his
Bed, came and kissed her Hand, and declared to
her his Passion. As soon as the King and Queen
heard of it, they came overjoy'd; the Queen flung
her Arms about her Neck, and embraced her, and
called her Daughter. The King and Queen made
her great Presents, the Cannons were fired, and
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
there were the most publick Demonstrations of
Joy possible.</P>
<P>The Prince desired she would consent to his
Happiness, and that they might be married; which
she refused till she had told them her Adventures,
which she did in few words. Their Joy was aug∣mented
so much the more, when they knew her to
be a Princess by Birth; and upon her acquainting
them with the Names of her Father and Mother,
inform'd her that they had deprived them of their
Kingdoms. As soon as she knew that, she swore
never to give her Hand to the Prince, unless they
were restored again to their Dominions, which the
King her Father-in-law made no scruple to grant.
In the mean time <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> ar∣rived,
and the first News they heard, was, that
their Sister had put on the Slipper, and were so
much confused, that they knew not what to say
or do, but at last were for going back again; when
she hearing that they were there, sent for them,
and instead of using them as they deserved, met
them, and embraced them, and afterwards pre∣sented
them to the Queen, acquainting her that
they were her Sisters, for whom she desired she
would have some respect. They were so much sur∣prized
at their Sister's Goodness, that they stood
speechless; but upon her telling them, that the
Prince her Spouse would restore the King their Fa∣ther,
and send them into their own Country, they
fell on their Knees before her, and wept for Joy.</P>
<P>The Nuptials were celebrated with all the Pomp
imaginable; <HI>Finetta</HI> writ a Letter to her God-mo∣ther,
which she sent with great Presents by the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, desiring her to find out the King and
Queen her Father and Mother, and let them know
her Good-fortune, and that they might return to
their own Kingdoms: which Commission the Fairy
acquitted herself of, and the King and Queen were
restored to their Dominions. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI>
lived as great and happy as they could desire,
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
and became afterwards great Queens as well as
their Sister.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of
Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>WE may imagine that the Count and <HI>Melan∣thia</HI>
applauded this Story out of Complai∣sance;
which pleased <HI>Juana</HI> so much, that she said,
in her opinion it was as good as Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s.
“Oh! Madam, <HI>said the Count,</HI> nothing comes up to
yours;” and had enlarged much more in its praise,
had not they been inform'd that the Archbishop of
<HI>Composiella</HI> was arrived. Whereupon she made all
the haste she could to go and receive him, and <HI>Me∣lanthia</HI>
was following her, had not the Count de∣tain'd
her: “Madam, you will think me very
bold, <HI>said he,</HI> to stay you, to tell you the Violence
of my Passion; but I love you—.” There he
stop'd, when resuming the Discourse again, he said,
“You blush at so barefaced a Declaration, but
judge not my Heart by my Fortune, I am sure it
will perform Miracles in my favour, if you are
but kind.” “Leave off your silly Discourse, <HI>Don</HI>
Estevus, <HI>said she, with an Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>of Disdain;</HI> the best
you can expect from your Temerity, is, that I
hold my tongue, and look on you for the future
as mad.” The Count was thunder-struck, and
was about to reply, that if Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had been the
Person, she had not answer'd him so sharply; but
over-ruling his Jealousy, he let her go without any
more to do, and walk'd in some disorder about the
Gallery, where he was met by Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who
from his Melancholy presaged some ill News, and
thereupon ask'd him what was their Fate; “I know
not what yours is, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> but for my
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
own, I have no reason to be over-well pleased with
it; <HI>Melanthia</HI> treats me like a miserable Wretch,
and fortifies herself against the Obscurity of my
Birth: but in short you are the greatest Obstacle.”
“Alas! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, how much more successful
am I? <HI>Isidora</HI> despises me as much, and I have
not yet dared to reveal my Passion, left I should
add to her Displeasure.” “You are less to be pi∣tied
than me, <HI>continued the Count; Isidora</HI> is alone
the Object of your Cares, but for my part, I must
be ridiculously complaisant to an old Woman, on
whom I am forced to bestow my more precious
Moments, and who every now and then lets me
know that I am not displeasing to her, and is
persuaded that I adore her: What can be more
extravagant?”</P>
<P>He went on, talking after this manner, without
receiving any Reply from Don <HI>Gabriel;</HI> which made
him ask him, What was the matter that he was in
so deep a Study? “I am making some Verses, <HI>re∣ply'd
he,</HI> upon <HI>Isidora</HI>'s Love, and you shall give me
your opinion when I have finished them.” “Oh!
<HI>said the Count</HI> I would not advise you to trust to
my Judgment, for at this time I have no Freedom
of Thought.”</P>
<P>Just as they were going out of the Gallery, they
heard Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Woman calling them, who
came for them to sing before the Archbishop; but
they knew themselves too well, to venture to ap∣pear
before him, and therefore excused themselves
upon account of a Rheum and a Pain in their
Heads: and for fear they should be press'd further,
went into the Chamber in the Park, that looked into
the Wood, which put a thousand Thoughts into
their Heads; one complain'd of their coming to
seek after Trouble and Cares, and the other griev∣ed
to find so little Return from an Heart capable
of making his Life happy: when looking towards
the Wood, they both agreed that they had been
happy if they had stay'd there, since they were so
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
unfortunate in their Loves: “For what can be
more fantastical, <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, than for <HI>Isidora</HI>
to have a favourable regard for you, and <HI>Melan∣thia</HI>
for me?” “We must change then, <HI>said the
Count,</HI> since our Felicity depends upon ourselves.”
“What a Proposition is this? <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel: Can
you be capable of doing what you say?” “Yes
certainly, <HI>said the Count with Passion,</HI> I would; but
my Heart knows not its own Interest.”</P>
<P>In this manner they pass'd away their time till
the Bishop was gone, and then went down into the
Park; and after a turn or two discover'd <HI>Isidora</HI> and
<HI>Melanthia,</HI> who had been so long stifled in <HI>Juana</HI>'s
Chamber, that they were come abroad to take a little
fresh Air. “Let us go into this green Arbour, <HI>said
Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>to his Cousin,</HI> and I will sing the Air I
have made upon <HI>Isidora;</HI> it may be they may come
this way:” And he did not guess amiss. But as
<HI>Melanthia</HI> was enraged against the Count, she desired
her Sister to stop before they were at the Arbour,
and told her the reason; whereupon they crept
along by the Trees, but not so softly, but Don <HI>Ga∣briel,</HI>
who was attentive to all, perceived they were
nigh, and thereupon sung these Verses.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Isidora,</HI> yield to Love,</L>
<L>Think not to resist his Arms,</L>
<L>Since all Hearts, or s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on or late,</L>
<L>Feel th' Impression of his Charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho the God is slow to conquer,</L>
<L>Your Resistance is in vain;</L>
<L>For 'tis better to surrender,</L>
<L>Since all must endure the Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What if Love with all his Pow'r,</L>
<L>To revenge his slighted Dart,</L>
<L>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u'd in your decl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning Years,</L>
<L>Pierce your stubborn trembling Heart:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
<L>Then the Passion you'll discover,</L>
<L>Lab'ring in your anxious Breast,</L>
<L>Useless Sighs each Day you'll breathe,</L>
<L>And each Night want <HI>Halcyon</HI> Rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! thou God of soft Desires,</L>
<L>Who o'er flatt'ring Hopes presides,</L>
<L>Restore those Beauties to my Eye,</L>
<L>Or make the whole World blind besides.</L>
</LG>
<P>But before Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had made an end, Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> came in upon them like a Fury, for she was
so uneasy at her dear Pilgrim's Head-ach, that as
soon as her Visitor was got into his Coach, she
search'd all the Walks in the Park; and being drawn
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hither by Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Voice, and hearing him
mention <HI>Isidora</HI> in the first Stanza, and old Age af∣terward,
made no dispute but that it was aim'd
at her. “Is it thus, <HI>said she,</HI> Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> you re∣pay
my Kindnesses, and the Entertainment I have
given you, by satirical Songs? Indeed, you give
my Neice very good Advice, and treat me after a
very ludicrous manner.”—</P>
<P>Our two Lovers Surprize at these Expressions
was not to be express'd, who apprehended nothing
so much as the Consequences of so violent a Pas∣sion;
then it was that they were sensible of what
they might lose, if she should oblige them to go.
The Count was endeavouring to excuse Don <HI>Ga∣briel,</HI>
when <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> urged on by a fear
they could not account for, came and interposed:
“What, Madam, <HI>said they,</HI> don't you remember we
made this Song in your Chamber to divert you,
and that you would have had us added two or
three Verses? We learnt them Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> and if
they displease you, we alone are to blame.”</P>
<P>As these two Ladies were used to take great plea∣sure
in making Songs, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was soon per∣suaded
to believe them, and was very glad to find
herself mistaken in her Suspicions; and told Don
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
<HI>Gabriel,</HI> she was sorry for the Expressions she use<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in her Passion, but said, “If you were in my place,
and thought those Verses design'd for you, you
could not but think them very disobliging.” Don
<HI>Gabriel,</HI> after he had made some civil Reply, turn'd
about to <HI>Isidora,</HI> and said, “I am infinitely obliged
to you, Madam, for your Justification of me; I
should have been in the utmost despair, if Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> had suspected me guilty of so much Ingra∣titude.”
Then speaking lower, he told her, he
should have died with Grief to have parted from
her: Which soft Language gain'd him a gracious
Look.</P>
<P>When they were retired, and had more liberty
of Discourse, the Count embracing his Cousin, told
him, that the old Lady had put him into a terrible
fright. “Ah! <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel, I have not recover'd
it yet; but if ever I mention her in any Verses
again, I'll—” “But <HI>interrupted the Count,</HI> what
an heap of ill Words had you put together? In∣stead
of declaring your Passion, you was enume∣rating
the Aunt's Faults.” “Oh! <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ga∣briel,
the Declaration was to come; I had not
time to sing that.” “Then make it next time in
Prose,” <HI>said the Count laughing.</HI> “I'll warrant you
think, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Gabriel, that I am sorry for
what I have done: I don't know whether <HI>Isidora</HI>
may shew more favour to Poets than other Folks,
but I'll assure you, she look'd more kindly upon
me than ever.” “Oh! was <HI>Melanthia</HI> of the same
Disposition, <HI>said the Count,</HI> I would make Verses
night and day; but her Heart is inflexible.” How∣ever,
the next day, as he was singing as tender pas∣sionate
Song, she gave him her Pocket-Book to
write it down; and he, embracing that Opportu∣nity,
instead of putting down what she desired,
writ the following Lines:
<Q><L>Sure no obdurate Heart can long disprove</L>
<L>A sincere, gen'rous, and respectful Love.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="86"/>
When she had read them, she pull'd out her
Handkerchief, and rubb'd them-out; which was no
small Grief to the Count, who, without taking any
great notice of it, said, “Madam, you have punish'd
me now for the Trick I served you; but if you will
lend me your Book again, I will write what you
desire.” And as soon as she gave it him, he put
down these Words, which were set to a Minuet.</P>
<Q><L>Since your Disdain's so great, I soon shall find</L>
<L>In Death a Mistress that will prove more kind.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Melanthia</HI> was more enraged at these Verses than
at the first, and addressing herself to Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI>
said to him; “Your Brother uses me with so much
Familiarity, that he surely believes himself my
Equal.” “I know too well, Madam, both who
you are, and who I am, <HI>reply'd the Count;</HI> but all I
do, appears criminal in your Eyes, which make
me but too sensible of my Misfortune to want
Merit.” At that <HI>Isidora,</HI> who was not very well
pleased with her Sister, said smiling, “My Sister is
proud, and very unkind.” “Alas! Madam, are you
less? <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel: which a little embarass'd
her; but the Person that spoke was not agreeable
enough to her to deserve an Answer. Thus these
four Persons, who were capable of compleating
each other's Felicity, were tormented by the Ca∣price
of their Stars.</P>
<P>In the mean time Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who had given
herself up entirely to her Passion for the Count, sent
for him into her Closet, and after a Preamble, the
Conclusion of which he dreaded; “Don <HI>Estevus,
said she to him,</HI> I take you to be so gallant a Man,
that tho I had resolved never to submit to the
hard Laws of Matrimony, yet I think I may ven∣ture
with you: My Father, who was Governour
of <HI>Lima,</HI> tho he has left me a plentiful Fortune in
<HI>Spain,</HI> has left me a much greater in <HI>Mexico;</HI> and
if you will go thither, you shall share it with
me: for I cannot stay here with Decenoy, after I
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
have married you, and there they won't know who
you are. Consider of it, and if you approve of
it, we will embark out of hand, since the Gal∣leons
will sail in a short time.” The Count, who
was very much surprized at so extravagant a Pro∣posal,
thought that a flat Denial would be too pi∣quant,
and therefore design'd to drive it off as much
as possible. “I cannot, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> shew too
great an Acknowledgment to you for all your Fa∣vours;
I am assured I shall never be ungrateful,
and that I may render myself the more deserving
of them, I will declare the State I am in.”</P>
<P>“A young rich Widow of Quality and Distinction
having taken a liking to me, made me a Proposi∣tion
of Marriage, which I accepted of with Joy,
and communicated to my Father, who was very
well pleased at it. We had not been married a∣bove
eight days at a Country-Seat she had near
<HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> before her first Husband arrived, who
was supposed to have been dead about ten Years.
My Wife, or, to speak more properly, his, pretend∣ed
not to know him: However, this Affair made
so great a noise, and my Vexation was so great,
that I left the Management of that Business to my
Father, and set out with my Brother for <HI>St. Jacques.</HI>
Now what I ask of you, Madam, is, that we may
stay till I know how this Matter is ended, before
we go for <HI>Mexico.</HI>” “You are very much in the
right, <HI>reply'd Donna</HI> Juana, <HI>very much concern'd;</HI> the
Success makes me somewhat uneasy, but I confess
if I had known you had been married, I should
have stifled my Sentiments for you betimes; for in
short, you love that Wife, and will always grieve
for the loss of her.” “Ah! Madam, <HI>said he, kissing
her Hand,</HI> I should find enough to comfort me with
you; but you know my Marriage must be first
made void.” Which the old Lady agreed to, tho
her Passion was strong enough to dispense with Po∣lygamy.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="88"/>
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> waited for his Cousin with the utmost
Impatience, and was afraid some unlucky thing had
fell out, and that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> would force them
to depart; but was pretty easy when he heard the
Count coming, singing some Verses he had made
upon Donna <HI>Juana.</HI> “I was cruelly afraid, <HI>cry'd Don
Gabriel,</HI> but you seem too gay for my Fears to
have any ground.” “Indeed I have very great
reason to be so, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> and you will say
so too, when you know that I come to invite you
to my Wedding.” “Your Wedding! <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Ga∣briel;
what with <HI>Isidora?</HI>” “No, <HI>said the Count
smiling,</HI> I have not so bad a Taste; I am to be mar∣ried
in <HI>Mexico,</HI> in the City of <HI>Lima,</HI> with the most
amiable Donna <HI>Juana.</HI>” “How extravagantly you
talk?” <HI>said Don</HI> Gabriel. “'Tis no Extravagance
at all, <HI>added the Count,</HI> the thing is serious; but
there's some little difficulty in it, because my Wife
that lives in <HI>Flanders</HI> can't bear jesting with.” At
that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> burst out a laughing, and the Count
told him all that had pass'd; which put Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>
under some Apprehensions of their not coming well
off that Story.</P>
<P>As it was then late, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the
Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> had no mind to part, they lay to∣gether
that night, but were not long in bed before
the Count heard the Chamber-door open'd very soft∣ly,
which surprized him, because he generally took
out the Key; but how much more amazed was he,
when he saw a Man and a Woman come in! which
made him jog his Cousin without speaking to him,
to see what pass'd, for 'twas Moon-light. Some∣times
they thought 'twas Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was
coming to make the Count a Visit, but could not
think what could make her bring a Man along with
her. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> remember'd that <HI>Isidora</HI> was grown
more obliging to him, and flatter'd himself that she
might have repented of her Indifference, and had a
mind to have some Discourse with him; but thought
the time was too suspicious for so discreet a Person,
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
and that 'twas the Count's Chamber, which again
perplex'd him, because he knew she had all along
shewn him the most Respect. These were their
Thoughts, when the Lady, speaking in a low Voice,
said, “I am afraid, Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> of your Aunt; how
will she receive me, after what I have done for
you?” “Fear nothing, fair <HI>Lucilla, said he,</HI> Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> knows how to behave herself, and my Si∣sters
will do all they can to please you; you are
at home, but now 'tis too late to awaken them,
therefore I am obliged to bring you into my Cham∣ber
for this night, and I'll take such care, that
nobody shall know where we are.” “Indeed, <HI>re∣ply'd
she,</HI> the Anger of my Relations will run to a
great height, for the Fortune that has been left
me is more valued by them than my Person; a∣las!
how will you be able to appease them? I
love you beyond all things, and hope to let them
know, that my taking you from them proceeded
entirely from the Violence of my Passion; for in
short, as to my Birth, I am no ways inferiour to
you, and have enough to—” Here he was in∣terrupted
by a violent Fit of Coughing, which the
Count was taken with, the very Noise of which
had made the lost <HI>Lucilla</HI> ran away, if Don <HI>Lewis,</HI>
when he came in, had not fasten'd the Door; who,
upon his advancing towards the Bed, was surprized
to see the very Clothes he left behind him in his
Wardrobe: and being assured that they were wore
by the Person that coughed, he was just going to
undraw the Curtains, when stopping short, and
turning towards <HI>Lucilla,</HI> he said, “I know not what
to resolve on, it may be this Man that cough'd is
asleep, and may not have heard us, or perhaps is
deaf, which is not a thing impossible.” At these
words Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and his Cousin burst out a laugh∣ing,
and undrawing the Curtains, said, “Don <HI>Lewis,</HI>
my dear Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> come to your best Friends,
who stand in as much need of your Discretion, as
you of ours.” Don <HI>Lewis</HI> soon knew them by their
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
Voice to be his very good Friends, who since their
leaving <HI>Cadiz</HI> were thought to be dead, nobody
having either heard from them, or seen them since
that time; and as there were great Troops of Rob∣bers
that infested the Roads, and gave none quar∣ter,
they were supposed to have been murder'd by
them: therefore it was much easier for Don <HI>Lewis</HI>
to take them for the Spirits of his Friends, than to
imagine that they were entertain'd by his Aunt
Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was so very severe a Woman.</P>
<P><HI>Lucilla</HI> shudder'd for fear, and Don <HI>Lewis</HI> stood
musing at so singular an Adventure, when the Count
said, “Come hither, my dear Friend, we have
great Matters to consult with you.” At that Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> ran to them with open Arms, and embracing
them, said to them, “I cannot express my Joy and
Surprize; your long Absence from <HI>Cadiz</HI> made me
very uneasy upon your accounts, but I am over∣glad
that what has been reported proves false.
But to find you in my Chamber, when I thought
myself alone with Donna <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and to meet with
you at my churlish Aunt's! Certainly 'tis upon
my Sister's account; come, disguise nothing from
me.” “Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> you are very much in the right
of it, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel; I was so sensibly touch'd
by the Merit of your elder Sister you told me
of, and have so handsomely described, that I

with you, if you had gone for <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l;</HI> I look'd
on the Execution of my Designs as a thing imprac∣ticable,
by reason your Aunt kept so strict a guard
over her: nay, I believe I should not have dar'd
to have ventur'd, if my Cousin here, who was
sensible of what I endur'd, had not thought of a
Disguise, by the favour of which we were re∣ceiv'd.”
Then the Count told him what had pas∣sed,
not forgetting his Passion for <HI>Melanthia,</HI> and
the Proposition Donna <HI>Juana</HI> made to go to the
<HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91"/>
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> heard them with a great deal of Plea∣sure
and Satisfaction, for his Sisters could not expect
better Matches; and he knew their personal Me∣rits,
Birth, and Fortunes: thereupon he embraced
them again, and express'd his Joy to see them in a
most engaging manner. “I foresee, <HI>said he,</HI> some
Difficulties, which Time alone must help you to
overcome; you say the Hearts of these young
Girls are not disposed as you would have them,
and that my Aunt will be enraged, when she sees
the Man she design'd for her Husband, her Ne∣phew:
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Father perhaps may have de∣sign'd
him for some other Lady; mine is absent,
and I have at present so great an Affair upon my
hands, since <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Relations will pursue me,
that perhaps I may be forced to go into <HI>Portugal</HI>
with her.” “You undo us, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel;
your Foresight discovers the Obstacles which our
Love prevented us from seeing, but notwithstand∣ing
we are resol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to persevere, and to die
sooner than not pursue our Loves.”</P>
<P><HI>Lucilla,</HI> tho she knew both Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the
Count, would not go near them, because they were
in bed, but sat down at the other end of the Room;
and Don <HI>Gabr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el</HI> seeing that Don <HI>Lewis</HI> was uneasy
for <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s want of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, advised him to lead her
to his Room, that was but on the other side of the
Hall, which he proposed to that agreeable Lady,
who accepted of it. After Don <HI>Lewis</HI> had shut the
Door, and return'd to his Friends, she laid herself
down in her Clothes.</P>
<P>When the three Friends had advised about their
Affairs some time, they at last resolved to let the
two Sisters into the Secret, and to engage them to
put some Restraint upon their Inclinations, and that
as soon as they should give their consents, to write
to both their Fathers for theirs, but not to let Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> know the Fallacy till every thing was con∣cluded
on. Thus their Conversation lasted till
eight a-clock in the Morning, when Don <HI>Lewis,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
whose Thoughts were employ'd upon <HI>Lucilla,</HI> went
into her Chamber; but finding her asleep, retir'd to
his Aunt <HI>Juana</HI>'s, who was very much surprized to
see him. After some Discourse, he told her, that
he had courted <HI>Lucilla</HI> with the Consent of her
Friends for two Years, when she had but a small
Fortune; that the Match was concluded, and he
loved her for her Virtue and good Qualities: but
upon the Death of her Brother, who was assassina∣ted,
and she being left one of the best Fortunes in
<HI>Andalusia,</HI> her Grandfather had removed her from
<HI>cad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z</HI> to <HI>Sevil,</HI> and kept her close up in his House,
with a design to marry her to a Son of a Friend of
his; that he not being able to brook so great an
Affront, and lose his Mistress, having some corre∣spondence
with her, had found out the means to
steal her away; and withal desired his Aunt to re∣ceive
her kindly, and pay her all imaginable Re∣spect.</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was very nice and cautious in
these sorts of Affairs, was afraid that <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Rela∣tions
should bring her in as a Party concern'd if
she receiv'd her; but recollecting that the House
was not hers, and so she was not answerable for
what was done in it, and that she should not know
how to keep her Musicians in the House, but Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> would blame her Conduct, and not suspect∣ing
but her <HI>West-Indian</HI> Project would succeed ac∣cording
to her Desires, she fancied she had thought
of a very good Expedient. “Nephew, <HI>said she to
Don</HI> Lewis, if you had ask'd my Advice before the
Execution of your Project, I should have dissua∣ded
you from it; for whatever Advantages you
may promise yourself, the Consequence appear so
very dangerous, that I am in some fear of the Re∣lations
of <HI>Lucilla.</HI> But I'll tell you one way; I
have an House hard by <HI>Sevil,</HI> your Sisters and I
will go and live there, and moderate Matters while
you stay here; when we are gone, you may marry
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> and we shall be there in a condition to
serve you.”</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="93"/>
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> approved his Aunt's Scheme, compre∣hending
it to be a means to engage <HI>Lucilla</HI> not to
defer his Happiness; for if she was not his Wife,
she could stay alone with him, whereas if she lived
with Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> she might remain there till she
heard what Resolution her Friends would come to:
therefore he declared to his Aunt, that he liked
her Contrivance very well, and then went to his
Sisters, who were just up, and were overjoy'd to
see him. After common Civilities, and reciprocal
Tokens of Friendship, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> acquainted them
with all his Proceedings, and his running away
with Donna <HI>Lucilla;</HI> at which they shew'd some
Uneasiness, dreading, as well as their Aunt, the fa∣tal
Consequences which generally attend those Af∣fairs.
When he told them, that he could not ex∣pect
that Death would be so kind as to take away
his greatest Enemy, who was not old, tho <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s
Grandfather; they told him, that as soon as they
were dress'd, they would pay their Respects to her,
and were persuaded they should live very happy to∣gether:
which he told them was not to be, for
that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was going directly into <HI>Andalusia,</HI>
for fear she should be brought into the Scrape.
“But, <HI>said he,</HI> my Aunt told me of two Pilgrims,
who being wounded in their way to <HI>St. Jacques,</HI>
she had taken into the House, and that they
taught to play upon Musick; were they not so
young and handsome, I should approve of their
being here: but if there is a necessity for you to
learn to sing, and play on Musick, there are Wo∣men
enough able to learn you, without harbour∣ing
Strangers, that are not accustomed to the
Manners of <HI>Spain,</HI> and who are apt to be too fa∣miliar,
if they are not kept at a distance.”</P>
<P>While he spoke, he observed all their Actions,
and perceived their Colour come and go, and soon
guess'd at the Cause. “Have you told Donna <HI>Jua∣na</HI>
so much?” <HI>said</HI> Isidora. “Yes I have, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
and found her not very willing to let them go a∣way;
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
but I told her positively they should, and
that I myself would take the care upon me.” There∣upon
fearing I should use them ill, she told me she
would do it herself. “Then will they go pre∣sently?
<HI>interrupted</HI> Melan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hia, <HI>somewhat melancholily.</HI>”
“Yes, I hope, to-day, <HI>said Don</HI> Lewis.” “What dan∣ger
can there be in their staying here? <HI>said</HI> Isido∣ra:
you must have a very ill opinion of us, to
think that Persons of so obscure Birth should be
capable of making any impressions on us.” “'Tis
not that I am afraid of you, Sister, <HI>said he,</HI> but
of the World, whose Censures are often very se∣vere;
and I am persuaded you will approve of
my Conduct.”</P>
<P><HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia</HI> endeavour'd all they could
to conceal their Grief from their Brother, who ne∣vertheless
observed it, and told them he never saw
them so melancholy before, and that they certainly
were sorry to part with those Strangers. “Indeed,
<HI>said</HI> Isidora, we are vex'd at your injurious Suspi∣cions.”
“I wish to Heaven, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> you were
as much grieved at the Inequality between you
and them, as they are pleasing to you.” “Upon
my word, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia, you carry things to too
great an height.” Upon which Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> who
thought he had diverted himself, embraced them,
and said, “Come, let us be Friends, 'tis time I
should now unravel the Mystery of those Pil∣grims,
who are both Men of Birth and Estates:
Don <HI>Gabriel Ponce,</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> is descended from the
most illustrious Family in <HI>Europe;</HI> Don <HI>Manuel
Ponce,</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Arcos,</HI> was his Grandfa∣ther,
who was descended from the Kings of <HI>Xe∣rica,</HI>
who were related to the Kings of <HI>Leon;</HI> the
same Don <HI>Manuel</HI> that maintain'd the wrong'd In∣nocence
of the Queen of <HI>Granada,</HI> when the King
of <HI>Chico,</HI> her Husband, would have put her to
death. And for Don <HI>Estevus,</HI> the Count <HI>d'Aguilar,</HI>
who passes here for a Musician, he is no ways in∣feriour
in Birth to the greatest Lords in <HI>Andalusia,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
and is descended from Don <HI>Alonso d'Aguilar,</HI> who
fought for the same Queen of <HI>Granada.</HI> In short,
they are both Gentlemen of Estates and Worth,
and are my particular Friends, and will marry
you; therefore judge, Sisters, of my Joy, to form
to myself such good Alliances, and make you
happy.”</P>
<P>When he left off speaking, they, instead of mak∣ing
any Reply, look'd first at one another, and then
at him, to see whether they might believe what he
said. “I see, <HI>continued he,</HI> you doubt my Sincerity,
and you have reason to do it, since the trick I
have play'd you; but assure yourselves, I never
spoke more seriously in my life: we spent the
whole Night together, they have declared to
me their Passion for you, the Usage they have
me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with from you, and the Extravagance of
Donna <HI>Juana.</HI>” “Now, Brother, I know, <HI>cry'd</HI> Isi∣dora,
you are in earnest; 'tis an hard thing for
such Persons as they pretended to be, to be
so well bred and qualified: I fancy'd twenty
times, that there was somewhat more than ordi∣nary
under their Pilgrims <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abit.” “But, dear Bro∣ther,
<HI>interrupted</HI> Melanthia, since there is so much
Friendship between Don <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riel</HI> and you, he has
without doubt told you which way his Choice in∣clin'd
him.” “Yes, Sister, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> he has put
that confidence in me, and declares for <HI>Isidora,</HI> and
the Count <HI>d'Agu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lor</HI> for you.”</P>
<P>At these words they both turn'd pale, their
Choice was already fix'd, and each thought her
Heart uncapable of altering its Sentiments; and
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> examining further into the matter, with∣out
discovering what he knew before, lest they
should complain of their Lovers Indiscretion, said
to them, “You seem to me to be averse towards
them; pray, Sisters, let Reason direct you, For∣tune
now is favourable, slight it not, but love the
Persons that love you: I advise not only as a
Brother, but as a Friend, and desire you to ex∣plain
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
plain yourselves so favourable on their sides, that
they may use the proper means to gain their
Friends Consents, and make you happy.” “The
obliging manner you speak in, Brother, <HI>reply'd</HI> Isi∣dora,
engages us so much, that we can keep the
Secret no longer from you; we both love, but not
the Persons that love us, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> is <HI>Melanthia</HI>'s
Choice, and the Count mine: how shall we be
able to change then the Objects?” “I won't believe
that, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Lewis, you are so deeply en∣gaged
that you cannot change, when the Change
is so much to your advantage. But adieu, I will
leave you to consider on't, and will expect you in
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Chamber.”</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, they both fell a crying.
“Was ever any one's Fate so fantastical as mine,
<HI>said</HI> Isidora, that which should have raised my Joy,
is the cause of my Grief; I am inform'd that this
pretended Musician is a Gentleman of the first
Rank, and at the same time that he loves another.”
“I have as much reason to complain of mine as
you have of yours, <HI>answer'd</HI> Melanthia, tho my
Sentiments for Don <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el</HI> make me blush; then
I had hope that Gratitude, and the Vanity of en∣gaging
my Heart might have had some influence
over him, but now I have none: He is deserving
of your Sister, and loves you, therefore you shall
make him happy.”</P>
<P><HI>Isidora,</HI> without returning any Answer for a long
time, leant her Head on one hand, and dry'd up her
Tears with the other; and then raising her Head,
and looking at her Sister, said, “To put you in pos∣session
of what you esteem most dear to you, and
is as indifferent to n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, I will give you the grea∣test
Mark of my Tenderness, I will take upon
me a religious Life, and then Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> must pay
homage to your Worth, and forget me.” “God
forbid, dear Sister, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia, that I should
accept of such a Proof of your Friendship; I
would soon follow you in the Retirement you
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
propose on my account, for was I so base as to
consent to it, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> would not forgive me:
He would not know what were the Motives of
my Retirement,” <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora. “Suppose he
should not, <HI>said</HI> Melanthia; does it follow that I
should possess his Heart the sooner? No, my dear
<HI>Isidora,</HI> I am persuaded his Heart would be sur∣prized;
he has been used to me, and is not unac∣quainted
with my Face and Conversation: I should
lose you, and gain nothing by it.” “But, <HI>said</HI> Isi∣dora,
if the first Acquaintance, as you say, decides
all Passions, we shall never love those that love
us, but go just by contraries.” “I hope not so, <HI>in∣terrupted</HI>
Melanthia, their Metamorphosis from Mu∣sicians
may have some effect on their Hearts; for
as we have hitherto taken care to conceal the
Sentiments of ours from them, I cannot but think,
that when they are inform'd of them, they will
be moved.” “Alas! you are very much mistaken,
<HI>continued</HI> Isidora, our Eyes have spoke too plain,
and their Language is too easily understood.”</P>
<P><HI>Melanthia</HI> was going to make some Reply, when
a Servant came to bid them dress presently, for
that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> intended to take them with her,
to pay a Visit to <HI>Lucilla.</HI> They plaited their Hair
in a negligent manner, and to add to their natural
Charms, mix'd some Flowers amongst it, which
made them look as beautiful as <HI>Flora</HI> herself. Their
Gowns were a thin white Crape, which is the
Mourning of Ladies of Fashion in <HI>Spain;</HI> which be∣ing
made close to their Stays, their Shapes appear'd
very delicate, and, in short, their whole Persons
extraordinary beautiful; only the Tears they had let
fall, had deprived their Eyes somewhat of their Vi∣vacity.
Afterwards they went to their Aunt's Cham∣ber,
and from thence attended her to <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s, who
was laid upon the Bed, somewhat cast down with
the Fatigue of a Journey, and Want of Rest; and
tho she was both young and handsome, and had
all the Spirit and Gayety that are generally met
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
with in Persons of her Quality, yet her Uneasiness
and Fears made her seem a little melancholy.</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana</HI> made great Professions of her Friend∣ship,
and told her, that since she was come into her
Family, she should love and respect her, and that she
should have not reason to repent what she had done
for her Nephew Don <HI>Lewis. Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia</HI>
made her the same Assurances in so tender and en∣gaging
a manner, as shew'd their Friendship; and
Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI> for her part neglected no Opportunity
to express her Joy to be with them, and be well
receiv'd: when Donna <HI>Juana</HI> interrupting the Dis∣course,
said, “Of all the rare Qualities, Madam,
which render you so amiable, my Nephew tells
me of one which is very agreeable to me.” “I war∣rant
it is, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Lucilla, that I am a
great Teller of Stories.” “The same, <HI>continu'd</HI> Ju∣ana;
and I am so great an Admirer of them, that
I must beg one of you now, if you are not over∣wearied.”
“Indeed, <HI>answer'd</HI> Lucilla, I am some∣what
fatigu'd; but since you request one, I shall
endeavour all I can to gratify you therein:” And
then after a small Pause began as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Palace of Revenge.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time there lived a King and Queen of an
Island, who after they had been married twen∣ty
Years, had a Daughter, whose Birth gave them
as much Joy, as the want of an Heir to succeed them
in their Dominions, had occasion'd Sorrow. The
young Princess was call'd <HI>Imis,</HI> and her growing
Charms from her Infancy promis'd Wonders in a
more advanc'd Age. Nobody in the whole World
would have deserv'd her, had not Love, who thought
it would be to his honour to add to his Empire so
wonderful a Person, taken care to have a Prince born
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
in the same Court, that was as charming as the Prin∣cess
<HI>Imis</HI> was lovely. This Prince, who was nam'd
<HI>Philax,</HI> was Son to the King's Brother, was two
Years older than the Princess, and they were edu∣cated
together with all the Liberty their Nearness
of Blood and Youth gave them. The first Emotions
of their Hearts yielded to Admiration and Tender∣ness.
They saw nothing so beautiful as themselves,
nor found any thing which could divert the Passion
they felt for each other, without knowing what to
call it. The King and Queen perceiv'd the Growth
of that Passion with pleasure; they lov'd the young
<HI>Philax,</HI> he was a Prince of their Blood, and never
Child gave greater Hopes. Every thing seem'd to
agree with Love to render <HI>Philax</HI> one day the hap∣piest
of all Men. The Princess was about twelve
Years old, when the Queen, who lov'd her most
tenderly, would consult a Fairy, whose Fame made
a great noise, about her Fortune. She went to find
her, and took <HI>Imis</HI> with her, who, in her Grief to
leave <HI>Philax,</HI> wonder'd a hundred times how they
could think of what was to come, since the present
was so agreeable. <HI>Philax</HI> remain'd with the King,
whom all the Pleasures of the Court could not com∣fort
for the Princess's Absence. The Queen arriv'd
at the Fairy's Castle, where she was magnificently
receiv'd, but the Fairy was not there. She was ge∣nerally
on the top of an high Mountain some di∣stance
from the Castle, where she lived by herself,
taken up with that profound Knowledge which
render'd her so famous in the World. As soon as
she knew of the Queen's Arrival, she came to her:
the Queen presented the Princess to her, told her
her Name, the Hour of her Birth, all which the
Fairy knew before, and promis'd the Queen to give
her an Answer in two Days, and then return'd to
the Mountain. The third Day she came again, took
the Queen into the Garden, and gave her some Ta∣bles
of Palm-tree Leaves close shut, but charg'd her
not to open them but before the King. The Queen,
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
to satisfy in some measure her Curiosity, ask'd her
several Questions about her Daughter's Fortune:
“Great Queen, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> I cannot tell you pre∣cisely
what kind of Misfortune the Princess is
threaten'd with; only I see that Love will have
the greatest share in the Accidents of her Life,
and that never Beauty created more violent Passi∣ons.”
There was no need of a Fairy to promise
that Princess Admirers, her Eyes seem'd already to
demand the Love of all the Hearts the Fairy assur'd
her of. Nevertheless <HI>Imis,</HI> not so much disturb'd at
her Fate, as at <HI>Philax</HI>'s Absence, amus'd herself with
gathering Flowers: but taken up with her Tender∣ness
and Impatience to be gone, she forgot the
Nosegay she began to make, and dreaming, threw
away the Flowers she had with pleasure gather'd;
then went to the Queen, who took her leave of
the Mountain Fairy. The Fairy embrac'd <HI>Imis,</HI> and
looking on her with the Admiration she deserv'd;
“Since 'tis impossible for me <HI>said she,</HI> (after some
Moments of Silence, which had something myste∣rious
in it) since 'tis impossible for me, fair Prin∣cess,
to change in your favour the Orders of the
Fates, however I will endeavour to prevent the
Misfortunes prepared for you.” After these Words
she gather'd herself the Heads of Lillies, and ad∣dreshing
herself to the young <HI>Imis,</HI> “Take these
Flowers which I give you, <HI>said she,</HI> they will ne∣ver
fade; and while you have them about you,
they will secure you against all the Misfortunes
Fate threatens you with.” Afterwards she fasten'd
the Nosegay to her Headclothes, and the Flowers
obeying the Intention of the Fairy, as soon as they
were on her Head adjusted themselves, and form'd
a Kind of Topping, whose Whiteness serv'd only to
shew that nothing could efface that of the fair <HI>Imis</HI>'s
Complexion. The Queen, after having return'd the
Fairy a thousand Thanks, went away, and return'd
to the Island, where the Court waited with impa∣tience
to see the Princess again. Never Joy appear∣ed
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
greater than in the Eyes of <HI>Imis</HI> and her Lover▪
The King was the only Person that was inform'd
of the Mystery of the Bunch of Lillies; which had
so agreeable an Effect on the Princess's fine brown
Hair, that every body took it only for an Ornament
she had chus'd out of the Fairy's Garden. The
Princess spoke much more to <HI>Philax</HI> of the Trou∣ble
she underwent in not seeing him, than of the
Misfortunes intended her. <HI>Philax</HI> however was
frighten'd, but the present Joy of meeting again,
and as the Misfortunes might be uncertain, they
gave themselves up to the Pleasure of seeing each
other again. In the mean time the Queen gave the
King an Account of their Journey, and gave him
the Tables the Fairy gave her, which the King
open'd, and found therein these Words written in
Letters of Gold:
<Q><L>Under the Guise of flatt'ring Hopes, hard Fate</L>
<L>Hides the Distresses that on <HI>Imis</HI> wait;</L>
<L>She must unhappy now at last become,</L>
<L>And thro' good Fortune past, meet an harsh Doom.</L></Q></P>
<P>The King and Queen were very much afflicted
with this Oracle, and sought in vain to have it ex∣pounded.
They said nothing of it to the Princess,
that they might not cause in her a useless Grief.
One day when <HI>Philax</HI> was gone a hunting, which
he did frequently, <HI>Imis</HI> was walking all alone in a
Wilderness of Myrtles, where she was very melan∣choly
because <HI>Philax</HI> stay'd so long, and reproach'd
herself with an Impatience: she was thus engag'd
in musing and thinking, when she heard a Voice
that said to her, “Why do you afflict your self, fair
Princess? If <HI>Philax</HI> is not sensible enough of the
Happiness of being belov'd by you, I come to offer
you an Heart a thousand times more acknowledg∣ing,
an Heart sensibly touch'd with your Charms,
and a Fortune worthy to be desir'd by any other
but you, whose Empire the World ought to own.”
The Princess was very much surpriz'd to hear this
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
Voice, she thought herself alone in the Wilderness,
and as she had not open'd her Mouth, she was much
more amaz'd that that Voice should answer her
Thoughts. She look'd about her, and perceiv'd a
little Man in the Air, mounted on a large <HI>May</HI> Fly:
“Fear not, fair <HI>Imis,</HI> said he to her, you have not
a more submissive Lover than my self, and tho
this is the first time I ever appear'd to you, I
have lov'd you long, and see you every day.”
“How much you amaze me! <HI>said the Princess
to him:</HI> What! do you see me every day, and
know what I think? Then you ought to see
that your Love is to no purpose. <HI>Philax,</HI> to
whom I have given my Heart, is too amiable
not to keep it; and tho' I may be a little vex'd
at him, I never lov'd him more than now: but
tell me who you are, and where you have seen
me.” “I am <HI>Pagan</HI> the Sorcerer, <HI>said he,</HI> and my
Power extends over all the World but you. I
saw you in the Garden of the Mountain Fairy, I
was hid in one of the Tulips you gather'd. I
look'd upon the Chance that made you gather
the Flower I was in, as an happy Presage, and
flatter'd my self you would take me along with
you: but you, too much engag'd with the Plea∣sure
of thinking on <HI>Philax,</HI> threw the Flowers
away, and left me in the Garden the most amo∣rous
of all Men. Ever since I have found that
nothing could make me happy, but the Hopes of
being belov'd by you. Think of me, fair <HI>Imis,</HI>
if possible, and permit me sometimes to remind
you of my Passion.” After these Words he disap∣pear'd,
and the Princess return'd to the Palace,
where the Sight of <HI>Philax</HI> dissipated the Fear she
had been in. She was so desirous to hear him ju∣stify
himself for staying so long an Hunting, that
she had almost forgot to tell him her Adventure;
but at last recollecting herself, told him what had
happen'd in the Wilderness. The young Prince,
notwithstanding his Courage, fear'd a winged Ri∣val,
against whom he could not contend for his
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
Princess. But the Lillies encouraged him against
all Enchantments, and <HI>Imis's</HI> Tenderness for him
remov'd all Fears of a Change in her. The next
Morning when the Princess awak'd, she saw twelve
little Nymphs fly into her Chamber, who were all
sat on Bees, and brought in their Hands little Bas∣kets
of Gold. They went to the Princess, paid their
Respects to her, and then went and laid their Bas∣kets
on a Table of white Marble, which appear'd
in the middle of the Chamber; which Baskets when
they were laid down, became very large. The
Nymphs, after they had left their Baskets, took
their leaves of <HI>Imis,</HI> and one of them approaching
nearer to the Bed than the rest, let something fall
on it, and then they all flew away. The Princess,
notwithstanding her Surprize at so strange a Sight,
took up what the Nymph had let fall by her; which
was an Emerald of a wonderful Beauty, that open'd
as soon as the Princess touch'd it, and contain'd a
Rose-Leaf, whereon these Verses were read:
<Q><L>All that gaze on your fair Eyes,</L>
<L>Must with Pleasure own their Pow'r;</L>
<L>With such Beauty they surprize,</L>
<L>None can lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k but must adore.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Princess could not recover her Astonishment,
but call'd the Ladies that waited on her, who were
as much amaz'd as <HI>Imis</HI> at the sight of the Table
and the Baskets. The King, Queen, and <HI>Philax,</HI>
ran at the noise of this Adventure; the Princess
suppress'd nothing in her Relation but her Lover's
Letters, which she thought she was not oblig'd to
give an account of to any but <HI>Philax.</HI> The Baskets
were examin'd with Care, and were found full of
Jewels of extraordinary Beauty, and so great Value,
that they redoubled the Astonishment of the Specta∣tors.
The Princess would not touch them; and
having found an opportunity when nobody heard,
she went to <HI>Philax,</HI> and gave him the Emerald and
Rose-Leaf. He read his Rival's Letter, which gave
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
him a great Uneasiness, and <HI>Imis</HI> to comfort him tore
it before his face; but how dear was that Sacrifice
to them! Some Time past without hearing any thing
of <HI>Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n:</HI> she thought that her Disdain had extin∣guish'd
his Love, and <HI>Philax</HI> flatter'd himself with
the same Hope. When one day as the Prince was
returning from Hunting, as he used to do, he stay'd
all alone by a Fountain-side to refresh himself, and
having the Emerald the Princess had given him
about him, and thinking on that Sacrifice with plea∣sure,
he took it out of his Pocket to look at it;
but he held it not a moment before it fell out of
his Hands, and as soon as it touch'd the Ground
was chang'd into a Chariot, and presently two wing∣ed
Monsters came out of the Fountain and harness'd
themselves to it. <HI>Philax</HI> look'd on them without
any Fear, being incapable of it; but could not but
feel some Concern when he saw himself convey'd
into the Chariot by an invisible Power, and pre∣sently
lifted up in the Air, where the Monsters
flew with the Chariot with great Ease and Swift∣ness.
In the mean time Night came on, and the
Hunters, after having sought <HI>Philax</HI> to no purpose
thro all the Wood, return'd to the Palace, where
they thought to find him; but not meeting with him,
and nobody having seen him since he was with
them, the King order'd them to go back to seek
him. The whole Court was in a great Uneasiness;
they return'd to the Wood, search'd it thro, and
came back at Day-break without learning any News
of the Prince. <HI>Imis</HI> past the Night in Despair for
her Lover's Absence, the Occasion of which she
could not imagine. She was then on a Terrass-Walk
of the Palace, to see those return who went
to find <HI>Philax,</HI> and flatter'd herself with seeing him
come along with them. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is impossible to ex∣press
the Excess of her Grief when she saw none
of <HI>Philax,</HI> and when they told her they could not
tell what was become of him; she swoon'd away,
and was carry'd to Bed, when one of her Atten∣dants,
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
with haste to undress her, took off her Head
the Bunch of Lillies that secur'd her against all
Enchantments; as soon as that was off, a Cloud
darken'd the Chamber, and <HI>Imis</HI> disappear'd. The
King and Queen were so griev'd at this Loss, that
they were not to be comforted. The Princess com∣ing
out of her Swoon, found herself in a Chamber
of Coral of divers Colours, inlaid with Mother of
Pearl, surrounded with Nymphs, who paid her pro∣found
Respect; they were all beautiful, and cloth'd
in magnificent Habits. At first <HI>Imis</HI> ask'd where she
was: “You are in a Place where you are ador'd,
<HI>answer'd one of the Nymphs;</HI> Fear nothing, fair Prin∣cess,
you will find here all you can desire.” “Is
<HI>Philax</HI> here, <HI>said the Princess,</HI> (with a Joy that ap∣pear'd
in her Eyes) I only wish for the Happiness
of seeing him again.” “You remember too long
an ungrateful Wretch▪ <HI>said</HI> Pagan, (appearing to the
Princess) and since that Prince has forsaken you,
he is not worthy of your Love; add Anger, and
the Value you have of your Honour, to the Passi∣on
I have for you, and reign here for ever, fair
Princess, where you will find immense Riches,
and all the Pleasures you can desire.” <HI>Imis</HI> re∣turn'd
no Answer to this Discourse of <HI>Pagan</HI>'s but
by Tears, and he left her for fear of provoking her
Grief. The Nymphs stay'd with her, and us'd all
their Endeavours to comfort her; they made her
a magnificent Entertainment, which she refus'd to
taste of. But in short, the next day her Desire to
see <HI>Philax</HI> again made her resolve to live; she ear,
and the Nymphs, to divert her Melancholy, carri∣ed
her to several Parts of the Palace, which was
built of fine Shells, mix'd with precious Stones of
different Colours; and what was more surprizing,
all the Furniture was of Gold, and of so fine Work,
that it plainly appear'd to be wrought by Fairie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
The Nymphs, after they had shew'd <HI>Imis</HI> the Palace,
led her into the Garden, the Beauty of which is
not to be represented; there they found a Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
drawn by six Stags, drove by a Dwarf; they desir'd
her to get into it, which she did, and they sat at
her Feet, and were carried to the Sea-side, where
one of them told the Princess that <HI>Pagan</HI> reign'd in
that Island, which he had made by his Art the fi∣nest
Place in the World. A Noise of Instruments
interrupted the Nymph's Discourse, the Sea was co∣ver'd
over with little Barks of Coral of a Fire-co∣lour,
which were full of whatever could contribute
to a gallant Sea-Entertainment. In the midst of
these little Barks there was one much larger than
the rest, drawn by two Dolphins, on which there
were Cyphers of <HI>Imis</HI> made with Pearls. It came
to the Shore, the Princess went into it, with the
Nymphs that were with her; as soon as she was in
it, there was a fine Collation before her, and she
heard a fine Concert from the Boats that were
about hers; they sung nothing but her Praises and
Commedations, but she for her part gave no At∣tention
to any thing. She went into her Chariot
again, and return'd to the Palace oppress'd with
Grief. That Night <HI>Pagan</HI> presented himself again
before her, and found her more insensible of his
Love than before; but he not dishearten'd, flatter'd
himself with his Perseverance: he knew not that
the most constant Lovers are not always the most
happy; he made every day Entertainments for the
Princess, with Diversions worthy of the Admiration
of the whole World, but her for whom they were
design'd. <HI>Imis</HI> was only concern'd for her Lover's
Absence, who in the mean time was carried by the
winged Monsters into a Forest <HI>Pagan</HI> was Master of,
call'd, <HI>The dismal Forest.</HI> As soon as <HI>Philax</HI> arriv'd
there, the Emerald Chariot and Monsters disap∣pear'd.
The Prince surpriz'd at this Adventure,
call'd all his Courage to his Aid, which was the on∣ly
Succours he could rely on there. He at first ran
thro a great many Paths of the Forest, which was
frightful, and whose Obs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urity the Sun never pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>netrated.
There he found nobody, not so much as
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
a living Creature of any kind; it seem'd that Beasts
themselves were terrified at so dismal an Abode.
<HI>Philax</HI> liv'd on some wild Fruits he found there, and
spent his Days in a mortal Grief. His Absence from
the Princess made him despair; and sometimes he
amused himself with his Sword, which he had with
him, to engrave <HI>Imis</HI>'s Name on Trees, which was
not design'd for so tender an Use; but when we
love indeed, we make use of those Things which
appear the most contrary. Nevertheless the Prince
kept going forwards, and had lived in the Forest
about a Year, when one Night he heard a complain∣ing
Voice, whose Words he could not distinguish.
The Frights that these Complaints might occasion
in the Night, in a Place where the Prince had ne∣ver
seen any body, and the Desire of not being
alone, and to find at least some as unfortunate as
himself, to whom he might tell his Misfortunes,
made him wait for Day with Impatience to find out
those he heard. He went towards that part of the
Forest from whence he thought the Voice came,
and sought about all day to no purpose; but at
length in the Evening he found, in a Place where
the Trees were thin, the Ruins of a Castle, which
appear'd to have been very spacious and lofty. He
went into a Court, the Walls of which were of
green Marble, and appear'd to be whole and en∣tire;
there he found Trees of a prodigious Height,
planted irregularly up and down the Court. He
advanc'd farther, to a Place where he saw some∣thing
raised on a Pedestal of black Marble, which
appear'd to be Arms laid confusedly on one another,
some Head-pieces, some Bucklers, and Swords, after
the old manner of Fighting, all which form'd a kind
of Trophy ill dispos'd. He look'd if there was no
Inscription to inform him whom those might have
belong'd to, and found one engrav'd on the Pede∣stal,
the Characters of which were almost effaced
by Time, but with great Pains he read these
Words:</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="108"/>
To the immortal Memory of the Fairy <HI>Ceorea,</HI>
<Q><L>Who in one Day triumph'd over Love,</L>
<L>And punish'd her unfaithful Lovers.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Inscription did not inform <HI>Philax</HI> in all he
wanted to know; so that he had continu'd his
March in the Forest, had not Night come upon him.
He sat himself down at the foot of a Cypress Tree,
and had not been sat long, when he heard the same
Voice he had heard the Night before; but was more
surpriz'd, when he perceiv'd those Trees complain'd
like Men. He rose up, drew his Sword, and struck
that Cypress which was the nearest to him; and
was about to renew his Stroke, when the Tree
cry'd out, “Hold, hold, hurt not an unfortunate
Prince, who is not in a Condition to defend him∣self.”
<HI>Philax</HI> held his Hand, and using himself to
these surprizing Adventures, ask'd the Cypress by
what Wonders he was both a Man and a Tree?
“I will tell you, said the Cypress, and since for these
two thousand Years this is the first and only Oppor∣tunity
I have had to make my Complaints, shall not
neglect it: All these Trees you see here were
Princes, considerable in their Time by their Rank
and Courage. The Fairy <HI>Ceorea</HI> reign'd in this
Country; she was handsome, but her Knowledge
render'd her more renown'd than her Beauty, so
that she made use of other Charms to subject us
unto her Laws. She was in love with the young
<HI>Orizeus,</HI> a Prince by his rare Qualities worthy of
a better Fortune, who is, <HI>added the Cypress,</HI> this
Oak you see by me.” <HI>Philax</HI> look'd on the Oak,
and heard it fetch a great Sigh, which the remem∣brance
of his Misfortunes undoubtedly forc'd from
him. “The Fairy to draw this Prince to her
Court, <HI>continu'd the Cypress,</HI> publish'd a Tournament,
and we all ran at this small Opportunity of gain∣ing
Glory. <HI>Orizeus</HI> was one of the Princes who
contended for the Prize against armed Fairies, who
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
were invulnerable. I was unhappily Conqueror,
and <HI>Ceorea</HI> vex'd that Fortune had not declar'd her∣self
agreeable with her Inclinations, was resolv'd
to revenge herself on us; she enchanted all the
Glasses, which the Gallery of her Castle was full
of that they who only saw her once represented
in those fatal Glasses, could not help feeling a
violent Passion for her. In that Place she receiv'd
us the next day after the Tournament; we all
saw her in those Glasses, and found her so hand∣some,
that those among us, who till then were
indifferent, were no longer so; and those who
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d before, became as easily unfaithful. We laid
aside all Thoughts of leaving the Fairy's Court,
we minded nothing but how to please her: in
vain might our Affairs of State call us home to
our Dominions; all seem'd unworthy of us, ex∣cept
the Hope of being lov'd by <HI>Ceorea. Orizeus</HI>
was her only Favourite, and the Passions of the
other Princes only serv'd the Fairy as Sacrifices
for this Lover, who was so dear to her, and to
spread abroad the Fame of her Beauty. Love
seem'd for some time to have soften'd <HI>Ceorea</HI>'s cru∣el
Temper, but after four or five Years reassuming
her former Fierceness, she reveng'd herself on the
Princes her Neighbours, on the least Occasions,
by the most horrible Murders; and abusing the
Power her Enchantments gave her over us, made
us the Ministers of her Cruelty. <HI>Orizeus</HI> endea∣vour'd
in vain to put a stop to her Injustice, for
tho she lov'd him, she would not obey him. One
day when I came from fighting with a Giant she
sent me against, and brought her the Arms of the
Vanquish'd, she was alone in the Gallery of Glas∣ses;
I laid the Giant's Arms at her feet, and
spoke to her of my Love with an incredible Ar∣dour,
which without doubt was augmented by
the Force of the Enchantments of the Place; but
she, far from shewing me any Acknowledgments
for my Success and my Love, treated me with an
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
insupportable Disdain, and retiring into a Closet,
left me alone in an inexpressible Despair and Rage.
I remain'd some time without knowing what Re∣solution
to take, for the Enchantments of the Fai∣ry
would not permit us to fight <HI>Orizeus.</HI> Careful
of the Life of her Lover, the cruel <HI>Ceorea</HI> made
us jealous, and depriv'd us of the natural Inclina∣tion
Men have to revenge themselves on an hap∣py
Rival. In short, after having walked about
some time in the Gallery, and remembring that
was the Place where I first began to love; here
'twas, <HI>cry'd I,</HI> I took the first Impressions of a
Passion which causes my Despair: I will punish
you fatal Glasses, who have so often represented
the unjust <HI>Ceorea</HI> to me with that Beauty which
seduced my Heart and Reason; I will punish you
for having offer'd to my Regard so many Charms.
At these words, taking the Giant's Club, which I
brought as a Present to <HI>Ceorea,</HI> I broke the Glas∣ses;
which was no sooner done, but I felt more
Hate for the Fairy than I ever had Love. The
Princes my Rivals at the same time found their
Chains broke, and <HI>Orizeus</HI> himself became asham'd
of being lov'd by the Fairy. <HI>Ceorea</HI> endeavour'd to
stay her Lover by her Tears: but he was insensible
to her Grief, and maugre all her Cries, we went
both together to fly from this dismal Abode; when
passing thro the Court where we now are, the
Heavens appear'd all on fire, a terrible Thunder
was heard, and we became immoveable. The
Fairy appear'd in the Air mounted on a large Ser∣pent,
and addressing herself in a Tone that disco∣ver'd
her Rage; “Fickle Princes, <HI>said she,</HI> I will
inflict on you a Punishment that shall have no
end for the Crime you have committed in break∣ing
my Chains, which were too glorious for you;
and for you, ungrateful <HI>Orizeus,</HI> I triumph at last
over your Love. Satisfy'd with this Victory, I
will make you endure the same Punishment as
your Rivals, and <HI>order,</HI> added she, <HI>in memory of this
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
Adventure, that when the Use of Glasses shall be known to
the whole World, the breaking of one of those fatal Mirrors
may be always a certain Presage of a Lover's Infidelity.</HI>
After she had pronounc'd these Words she disap∣pear'd,
we were chang'd into Trees, and the cru∣el
<HI>Ceorea</HI> without doubt left us our Reason to add
to our Sufferings. Time hath destroy'd this state∣ly
Castle, which was the Witness of our Misfor∣tunes,
and you are the only Person that has come
to this frightful Forest for the two thousand Years
we have been here.” <HI>Philax</HI> was about returning
an Answer to the Cypress, when all on a sudden he
was transported into a very fine Garden, where he
found a beautiful Nymph, who making up towards
him, with a smiling Air said, “If you are willing,
<HI>Philax,</HI> I will shew you within these three Hours
the Princess <HI>Imis.</HI>” The Prince overjoy'd at a Pro∣posal
so little expected, cast himself at her feet, to
shew his Acknowledgment. At that very time <HI>Pa∣gan</HI>
was in the Air with the Princess, conceal'd by
a Cloud. He had told her a thousand times that
<HI>Philax</HI> was unfaithful, which she always refus'd to
believe on the word of a jealous Lover; and he
conducted her to this place on purpose, <HI>he said,</HI> to
convince her of the Lightness of a Prince, whom she
prefer'd so unjustly. The Princess saw <HI>Philax</HI> at
the Nymph's feet, and was vex'd she could not de∣ceive
herself on what she dreaded so much. <HI>Pagan</HI>
kept her at such a distance from the Earth, that it
was impossible for her to hear what <HI>Philax</HI> and the
Nymph said, who, by his Orders, had presented her∣self
to the Prince. <HI>Pagan</HI> return'd with the Prin∣cess
to the Island, where, after he had convinc'd
her of <HI>Philax's</HI> Infidelity, he found he had only in∣creased
that Princess's Grief, and that she was not
the more sensible towards him. Vex'd to see that
this pretended Infidelity, from which he hoped for
Success, was of no use he resolv'd to revenge him∣self
on the Constancy of these two Lovers. He was
not so cruel as the Fairy <HI>Ceorea,</HI> his Grandmother;
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
therefore he thought on another Revenge than that
whereby she punish'd her unhappy Lovers. He had
no mind either to destroy the Princess, whom he
tenderly lov'd, or <HI>Philax,</HI> whom he had made en∣dure
enough. But bounding his Revenge in put∣ting
an end to a Passion so contrary to his, he rai∣sed
in his Island a Palace of Chrystal, provided it
with all Things agreeable to Life, except the means
of going out of it, put into it Nymphs and Dwarfs
to serve <HI>Imis</HI> and her Lover, and when every thing
was ready for their Reception, transported them
both into it. They thought themselves at first at
the height of their Happiness, and return'd <HI>Pagan</HI> a
thousand Thanks for his gentle Anger, who in the
mean time would not see them so soon together;
but comprehending that in time that sight would
not be so cruel to him, left the Palace of Chrystal,
after having engrav'd with a Stick this Inscription:</P>
<P>As Absence was thought by <HI>Philax</HI> and <HI>Imis</HI> the great∣est
of all Misfortunes, <HI>Pagan,</HI> to revenge himself on their
Constancy and Perseverance, hath condemn'd them here to
the perpetual Sight of each other.</P>
<P>It is reported, that at the end of some few Years
<HI>Pagan</HI> had his desired Revenge, and that <HI>Philax</HI> and
<HI>Imis</HI> accomplishing the Mountain Fairy's Prediction,
wish'd with as much Desire to find the Bunch of
Lillies again to destroy the agreeable Enchantment,
as they had preserv'd it before with Care to secure
them against the Misfortunes foretold.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of
Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Lucilla</HI> had made an end of her Story,
Donna <HI>Juana</HI> and her Neices return'd her
Thanks for the favour she had done them▪ and Don
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
<HI>Lewis</HI> for his part neglected not to praise both her
Wit and great Genius: to which Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI> an∣swer'd
with all Modesty imaginable; when a Ser∣vant
came to inform Donna <HI>Juana</HI> that Dinner was
ready, who desired her Nephew to admit the Pil∣grims
to Table, and to receive them handsomely.
As soon as the Cloth was taken away, when the
Ladies withdrew, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> took <HI>Lucilla</HI> by the
Hand, and led her into her Closet; where, after
some Compliments, she told her, that it was agreed
between her Nephew and herself that she should go
to an Estate she had near <HI>Sevil,</HI> that she should
leave her with Regret, but that after what she had
done for Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> she could not refuse compleat∣ing
his Happiness, by marrying him, to preserve her
Honour and Reputation, and since by living with
an Husband she lov'd she would be the less sensible
of Solitude. <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who could not help blushing
when she mention'd so hasty a Marriage, told her
very civilly, she should for the Time to come regu∣late
her Conduct by her Orders; that she was sor∣ry
to lose her good Company, but since she thought
it necessary for her Repose, she shoud not presume
to dissuade her from it. And then <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Me∣lanthia</HI>
came in, who were so much prepossess'd in
favour of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and she of them, that they lov'd
at the first sight. After they had declar'd how con∣cern'd
they then both were to leave her, Donna
<HI>Lucilla</HI> said, “How unfortunate am I to give you so
much Trouble, and to be the Occasion of your
going from your own House; I fancied to my self
a thousand Pleasures from your Conversation, and
had never resolv'd to have come from <HI>Sevil,</HI> had
I not form'd to myself a thousand flattering Idea's.”
These tender Words put the two Sisters in mind of
their cruel Separation from Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the
Count, and rais'd in their Imaginations those Tor∣ments
they should endure by never seeing them
more. They sigh'd, and the Tears ran down their
Cheeks so p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fully, that <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who look'd upon
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
them as the Marks of their Friendship, throwing
her Arms about their Necks, embraced them, min∣gling
her Sighs and Tears with theirs.</P>
<P>While they were thus afflicting themselves, Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> was comforting Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count,
and giving them an account of the Situation of
their Affairs; who, tho they knew that their Pas∣sions
were misplaced, yet hoped that Time, Reason,
and their Perseverance, might make some Altera∣tions
in their Mistresses Hearts: But alas! what
Torments could be greater, than to be separated
from the Objects of their Desires! As Don <HI>Lewis</HI>
was sensible of the cruel State they were in, he
did all that lay in his power to mitigate their Sor∣rows,
saying, “Afflict not yourselves, my dear
Friends, I hope my Sisters will know their
own Interests; I will give you an opportunity
presently to entertain them, for 'tis likely Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> will not be long before she goes.” “Our
whole Dependance lies on you, <HI>reply'd they,</HI> there∣fore
judge of our Acknowledgment by the Great∣ness
of the Obligation; for, in short, we look up∣on
the Love of those two charming Persons as
the greatest Happiness that can attend us.”</P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> her Thoughts were not half
so much employ'd upon her Journey, as how she
should take her dear Musician along with her; but
as she was afraid of having some trouble given her,
she waited with the utmost Impatience till the
Count's pretended Marriage was annulled, that she
might conclude her own. In short, after a thou∣sand
Reflections, her Tenderness prevail'd, and she
sent for the Count into her Closet, that she might
have the more freedom of Discourse; where the
first thing she said to him, was, “Don <HI>Estevus,</HI> I am
going away from this House to <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dalusia;</HI> will
you go along with me?” “Wherever you please,
Madam, <HI>reply'd h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and shall think myself too hap∣py,
that you will suffer me.” After that, Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> said all the obliging things she could think
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>
of; and the hopes of bearing <HI>Melanthia</HI> company in
this Journey, made him in so pleasant a humour,
that he said so many agreeable things as charmed
her.</P>
<P>Things were in this condition, when Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
went in the Evening to the little Box that stood on
that side of the Park, which had a Closet that look'd
towards the Wood, which was full of Books and Pa∣pers,
and of which she kept the Key, and had lock'd
herself in, to look for some Writings. Now as she
seldom or ever came hither, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> pitch'd up∣on
it as a proper place for Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count
to have the opportunity to entertain his Sisters,
whom he left when he came to the Steps, telling
them he would go and acquaint his Friends of
their being there; charging them, if they loved
him or themselves, not to neglect the making of
their Fortunes: which Donna <HI>Juana</HI> hearing, she
never left listening attentively to all they said.</P>
<P>They were no sooner up the Stairs, but <HI>Isidora</HI>
looking about, said to her Sister, “This is the Place
so fatal to our Quiet, this is the Place where we
first heard the lovely Pilgrims; could we then
have thought that they made use of that Strata∣gem
to see us?” “Ah! Sister, <HI>interrupted</HI> Melan∣thia,
how well pleased should I have been, if
their Hearts or ours had not err'd in their Choice?
But what shall we say to them? Shall we own
our Sentiments?” “What would you resolve on,
Sister! <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora: Is it not enough that we
hearken to theirs? Do we not wound our Duty,
by consenting to this kind of Rendevous? And
does not my Brother, by leading us into an Ad∣venture
we are so little acquainted with, break
in upon all Rules of Decency?” “It was proper
to have made these Reflections before, <HI>interrupted</HI>
Melanthia <HI>again;</HI> but I must tell you, I am afraid
of things of greater importance, I am more afraid
left Donna <HI>Juana</HI> should discover our Sentiments.”
“She would be very angry, <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora, since she
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>
has a great Tenderness for the Count, and has made
up a green Suit of Clothes embroider'd with Sil∣ver,
on his account.” “Impossible! <HI>said</HI> Melanthia;
the Extravagance is so great, I can hardly believe
it.” “I protest 'tis truth, <HI>continued she;</HI> and if you
observe it, few old People regulate their Clothes
to their Years: they think to deceive the World
by their appearing gay, but in my opinion they
most deceive themselves.” <HI>Melanthia</HI> was return∣ing
some Answer, when Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count
came in, who both made very low bows, but with
such an Air of Embarassment, that each seem'd to
have their Thoughts very much employ'd, but durst
not declare their Sentiments. At last <HI>Isidora</HI> assu∣ming
the Discourse, said, “If we have not given you
all the Respect that is owing to your Birth and
Worth, you ought to blame yourselves, since your
Disguise was the Cause.” “Ah! Madam, <HI>reply'd
Don</HI> Gabriel, we ask for no Compliments; you
know our Passion and Intentions, vouchsafe but
to approve them, and we shall be too happy: You
cannot doubt, <HI>continued he,</HI> but that your Merit
had all the power imaginable over us, since we
left <HI>Cadiz</HI> on purpose to see you; and knowing
the Severity of your Aunt, dressed ourselves in
this Disguise, which nothing but the Violence of
our Passion could have induced us to: Then think,
Madam, if we were capable of doing these things
before we saw you, what we are uncapable of
after the sight of such Beauties.”</P>
<P>“If, Madam, <HI>said the Count,</HI> you approve my Pas∣sion,
if any of the Sighs and Vows I have offer'd
up to you, be agreeable, that Passion would en∣gage
me to do any thing; but when my Complai∣sance
to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> obliged me to bear him com∣pany,
I look'd upon Love as a dangerous Rock I
could not too much avoid: the condition I saw
him in, gave me a dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste against any such Gal∣lantry,
that I in a manner resolved never to en∣gage
in any such. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, O Heavens! what force
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
had my Resolution? when I saw you, my Heart
was too much charmed to make the least resist¦ance,
and seem'd as if made only to love you.”
The just Dread you had of Love, Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Me∣lanthia,
ought to be an Instruction to me how to
withstand such an Engagement.” “I must own,
<HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er'd he,</HI> that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Chagrin was so vio∣lent,
that I was an hundred times in the mind to
have renounced his Friendship; but alas! you
have justified him too much, and I was satisfied
when I knew you, that there is a fatal Hour,
wherein all must yield: But why should I name
that fatal Hour, since it lies in your power,
Madam, to make it the happiest of my Life?”
<HI>Melanthia</HI>'s confused Silence put the Count into such
a Perplexity of Thoughts and Fears, that he durst
say no more to her; which she perceiving by his
Eyes, told him, That the Declaration he expected
from her, was not in her own power, since he
could not be ignorant of her Duty to her Family,
as well as to herself.</P>
<P>As so tender a Conversation could not be general
any long time, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> desired to entertain <HI>Isi∣dora</HI>
alone, and led her towards a kind of Alcove;
and <HI>Melamb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> for her part, sat by the Door of
the Closet, with the Count at her feet: where, tho
they talk'd very low, <HI>Juana</HI> heard all they said.
What a cruel time had that poor Lady, to discover
that the Count was neither a Pilgrim, Musician,
nor Ler Lover; but a Man of Birth and Fortune,
who was in love with her Neice, whom he design'd
to marry, and that he did all that Man possibly
could to touch her Heart, swore, sigh'd, and pro∣mis'd;
that <HI>Melanthia</HI> seem'd no ways insensible of
all he did, and that she was made a fool of; nay,
that the Count ridiculed her about her chimerical
Marriage; who, in short, to tire her patience, sang
these Verses▪
<Q><PB N="109" REF="118"/>
<LG>
<L>In some private Grot retir'd,</L>
<L>Free to speak without Constraint,</L>
<L><HI>Juana,</HI> in a moving Tone,</L>
<L>To Heav'n sends up this Complaint:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Age, alas! and hoary Hairs,</L>
<L>Awesul Distance do require,</L>
<L>Wrinkles too may claim Respect,</L>
<L>But can't tender Love inspire.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>In short, there was nothing omitted in this Con∣versation,
to convince Donna <HI>Juana</HI> of her Misfor∣tune,
and 'tis not to be thought how she was able
to bear it; for she has said since, that she had not
power to open the Door, and shew herself. For <HI>Isi∣dora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they heard the Prote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation of
their Lovers with a great deal of pleasure, and since
they could not hope that they would change their
first Sentiments, upon considering their Worth, and
the Advantage they had in such a Match, thought
in justice they should no longer oppose them.</P>
<P>Never were two Lovers better satisfied, they
began to gather hopes, which they never durst flat∣ter
themselves with before; for they always were
afraid, lest <HI>Isidora</HI> being prepossessed for the Count,
and <HI>Melanthia</HI> for Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> should refuse to
submit to any other Impressions: they parted from
them with great reluctancy, having never tasted so
much of Pleasure before. The two Ladies applaud∣ed
each other on the glorious Conquests they had
made; but the first Impressions had taken so deep
root, that they thought a little time necessary to be
assured of their own Sentiments. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and
his Cousin went to Don <HI>Lewis</HI> in <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Chamber,
and <HI>Isidora</HI> and her Sister to their own Apartments;
and in the mean time Donna <HI>Juana</HI> recover'd a lit∣tle
from her Surprize, got into the House, and lock∣ing
herself up in her Closet, writ the following
Letter to the Count <HI>d'Aguilar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="119"/>
“YOUR noble Birth does not protect you from
the just Reproaches you deserve from me;
you have pretended you were wounded, and
counterfeit a false Name, and I have not only re∣ceived
you into my House, but also into my Heart:
but alas! while I exercised my Hospitality, you
meditated my Ruin. You and your Cousin have
both had the liberty to see my Neices, who are
young and innocent, and to engage their Hearts,
use them as you have done me; but don't think
me so weak to forget your Ingratitude, which I
shall carry with me to my Grave. Think on
what I would have done for you, when my Igno∣rance
of your Fortune made you seem so much
below me; my Kindness deserves all the Acknow∣ledgment
of your Heart, instead of which, you
make me the Subject of your satirical Songs: I
should have had the utmost despair to have en∣dured
such base Usage, if Fortune had not fur∣nished
me with a quick Revenge. Know, Sir,
my Revenge shall be my Comfort; I take from
you the Persons you love: an austere Convent
shall for the future be answerable for their Con∣duct;
and if they marry with you, I will not give
them a farthing.”</P>
<P>As soon as she had made an end of this Letter,
and had composed herself, she sent for her Major-Domo,
and told him she design'd to go at midnight;
and therefore order'd him to be ready by that time
at the Park-Gate, and to let nobody know it, but
those few Attendants that were to go with them,
whom he was to enjoin to Secrecy. Afterwards she
sent for her Nephew, and said to him, “Believe me,
you must lose no time to marry <HI>Lucilla,</HI> for you
must think her Relations will come and take her
from you; and since you love her, and think the
Match so advantageous, to avoid all Disappoint∣ments,
I would have you go to-night to <HI>Compostel∣la,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
to get a Licence to marry her here.” Which
Advice agreeing too well with Don <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Passion,
for him to find any difficulty in it, he told his
Aunt, he would but go and speak to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and
then take horse.</P>
<P>By this means the cunning <HI>Juana</HI> got rid of her
Nephew, with whom she was as angry as with the
Pilgrims, whose Friend she knew him to be: but
to shew an Easiness and Gayety of Temper, that
they might have no mistrust of her going, she sung
all that night a <HI>Spanish</HI> Song, complaining of slighted
Love, which was set to a very agreeable Saraband,
which all the Company took notice of, especially
the Count; who thinking it would not be amiss to
carry matters fairly with her, approaching toward
her, said, “What do you mean by this melancholy
Song, Madam? You never sure met with a Rival
that durst dispute an Heart with you.” “Those
Lines you heard me sing, <HI>reply'd she, with a forced
Smile,</HI> have no regard to myself, I only repeated them
out of mere Humour.” <HI>Isidora, Melanthia,</HI> and Don
<HI>Gabriel,</HI> who could not comprehend the Mystery,
said laughing to themselves, “She is certainly a
Witch, since nothing could be more agreeable to
what has pass'd to-day.” Whereupon she, who
knew more of their Intrigues than they thought
she did, observing all their Looks and Actions, had
much ado to forbear speaking; but mastering her
Passion, she at last only told them it was late, and
so bid them good-night.</P>
<P>At midnight she went into her Neices Chamber,
and making them rise, never left them till they
were dress'd and ready to go. They, for their parts,
seeing neither their Brother nor Lovers appear,
were in the greatest Consternation imaginable;
which <HI>Juana</HI> never minded, but hurried them away
in a Coach to <HI>Andalusia,</HI> without ever letting them
so much as take their leaves of <HI>Lucilla.</HI> But how
great was the Surprize of our gallant Pilgrim, when
the Almoner came the next morning into his Cham∣ber,
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
and told him Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was gone, and deli∣ver'd
her Letter; which when he had read over,
he gave it to Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying, “We have been
betray'd, but how, or by whom, I cannot tell,
since we have trusted none with the Secret that
would discover it: Don <HI>Lewis</HI> has too much Ho∣nour,
and <HI>Lucilla</HI> Discretion; and for <HI>Isidora</HI> or <HI>Me∣lanthia,</HI>
'tis not probable they should, since <HI>Juana</HI>
seems angry with them, and threatens them with
a Convent, and to disinherit them: therefore she
must certainly have heard us, for she knew where
we were.” To which Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> seeming most
apt to give credit, said, “Undoubtedly she over∣heard
us in the Box in the Park.” “Oh! <HI>cry'd the
Count,</HI> I remember as I sat with <HI>Melanthia</HI> by the
Closet-door, I often heard a noise, and fancied it
to be like somebody sighing, without its ever en∣tring
into my head that she had lock'd herself in
it. Good God! <HI>continued he,</HI> if <HI>Juana</HI> was there,
why did she not come out, and tear out my Eyes?”
“What she has done, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>melancholily,</HI>
is more cruel than Death; believe me, she is re∣venged
enough, by taking away what is dearer to
us than the Light, I shall never see <HI>Isidora</HI> again,
nor you <HI>Melanthia.</HI> Alas! we shall never have the
liberty to see them, walk with them, and talk
with them again; <HI>Juana</HI> is so much enraged a∣gainst
us, that she will oppose all our Designs, and
prepossess her Brother against us: it may be she
may make her Neices change the Sentiments they
are hardly yet grounded in, either thro fear or
complaisance. The Misfortunes and Troubles I
foresee, <HI>continued he,</HI> make me ready to die for
Rage and Grief, without knowing what to re∣solve
on.”</P>
<P>These melancholy Reflections were follow'd by a
deep Silence, and they seem'd more like Statues
than Men; but this Lethargy lasted not long, for
the Almoner coming into their Chamber in a fright,
told them, that the Castle was invested by armed
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
Men, who demanded Entrance; that he had but
just time to secure all the Doors; that they threat∣ned
to break them open; and that if they thought
fit to do it, they were not able to oppose them.
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count were as much surprized
at this News, as unresolved what to do. “Let us
preserve <HI>Lucilla</HI> for Don <HI>Lewis, said the Count;</HI>
'tis the greatest piece of service we can do him.”
“You don't pretend, <HI>interrupted Don</HI> Gabriel, to hold
out a Siege against this little Army.” “No, <HI>reply'd
the Count;</HI> but I pretend that we may take horse,
and carry <HI>Lucilla</HI> off by the Park-Gate, where
there is no appearance of their being posted, and
get to <HI>Tuy,</HI> and pass the River <HI>Menstio;</HI> and when
we are in <HI>Valencia,</HI> we shall be out of danger, since
it belongs to <HI>Portugal.</HI>” “What confounds me, <HI>said
the Almoner,</HI> is, the Horses that are left here are
good for nothing, and our Affairs are so urgent,
that we cannot go any where to get better.”
Whereupon Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> told him, they must do the
best they could, since there were no other measures
to be taken.</P>
<P>Afterwards they went into Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Cham∣ber,
to acquaint her, and met her coming to theirs.
“Ah! Sir, <HI>said she to the Count, who went first,</HI> I am
lost, if you find not out some way to save me; my
Grandfather is come, with the Person he designs
to marry me to, I saw them from the Turret, they
are accompanied with a great number of their Re∣lations
and Friends. Alas! <HI>continued she, crying,</HI>
what an unhappy Wretch am I, to be the cause of
so much disturbance in my own Family, and so
much trouble to Don <HI>Lewis!</HI> For how great must
his Grief be, if as a Recompence for all his Pains,
he finds me in the power of his Rival?” “Fair
<HI>Lucilla, said the Count,</HI> be persuaded that we will
serve you as much as Don <HI>Lewis</HI> would, were he
here; we have determin'd to carry you off, and
not defer it a moment.” Afterwards he put on
her Veil, and taking her by the Hand, led her down
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
stairs, set her on horseback behind Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI>
and himself mounted the Almoner's Mule, and then
went thro the Park without any Obstacle, and made
the best of their way with their sorry Tits; and
would have been glad to have had their own Horses,
if they could have sent to <HI>Ciudad-Redrigo,</HI> where
their Valet had lain with them since their first Re∣ception
at Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s, but their Circumstances
would not allow of it.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand de la Vega,</HI> who was the Person that
was to have marry'd <HI>Lucilla,</HI> concern'd both for his
Honour and Love, did all he possibly could to irri∣tate
her Grandfather and Relations; and fearing lest
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> should escape with her by some Back∣door,
as soon as he arrived, engaged some Peasants
to watch, who knowing the Park-Gate, pretended
to be working in the next Field, and seeing <HI>Lucilla</HI>
and the two Gentlemen come out there, went and
inform'd Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of it. He was a young
hot-headed Man, not brave, but capable of doing
any base Action; and thinking it would be in vain
for him to attack Don <HI>Lewis</HI> alone without an ad∣vantage,
took two Cousins and two Valets, all well
mounted, along with him, and knowing what Road
<HI>Lucilla</HI> was gone, posted themselves in a thick Wood
they were to pass through; where being favour'd by
the Trees, they were so cowardly as to fall on Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count, without giving them any no∣tice.
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was wounded in the Knee, and
the Count had his right Arm broke; and his Mule
being frighten'd with the Fire, and Report of the
Piece, ran away with him: and he not having
Strength to hold him in, and endeavouring to
throw himself off, his Foot hung in the Stirrup,
and he was dragg'd a great way, till the Girt broke
at last, and he was lest wallowing in his Blood.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Lewis</HI> was returning from <HI>Compostella</HI> with the
Archbishop's Licence, promising to himself all ima∣ginable
Felicity, when perceiving a Man lying almost
dead, tho he did not know him, by reason his Face
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
was all over Blood and Dust, yet, notwithstanding
the haste he was in to get home, he could not think
of leaving him to the care of his Gentleman and
his Valet, but must go towards him: But, O Hea∣vens!
what a Meeting was this to so true a Friend?
He hasten'd off from his Horse, and embracing the
Count, could not refrain from Tears; and while
the Valet went to a Spring that was hard by, Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> and his Gentleman examin'd his Wounds,
which when they had wash'd, and assisted him all
that lay in their power, the Count began to breathe,
and opening his Eyes, knew Don <HI>Lewis.</HI> “What
do you here? <HI>said he, in so low a Voice, that he could
hardly be heard;</HI> run to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who will be taken
away, in the next Wood, where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> is
wounded.” Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> at this dismal News, was
just ready to expire, not knowing what to do in
such an Extremity, having two Friends dead or dy∣ing,
and a Mistress, so dear to him, in the power of
his Enemies; at last resolving to follow her, and to
die or bring her back, he left his Gentleman with
the Count, and sent his Valet for Assistance: But
before he went, addressing himself to his Friend,
said, “I am going to succour <HI>Lucilla</HI> and Don <HI>Ga∣briel,</HI>
it shall not be long before I revenge you,
and return.” With that mounting his Horse, he
rid with all speed to the Wood, where he heard loud
Shrieks, which he knew to be <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Voice, who
made all the resistance she was capable of, against
Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and one of his Servants, who were
setting her upon an Horse; for Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had kil∣led
two of the Assassines, and the others had under∣gone
the same fate, if they had not conceal'd them∣selves
behind some Bushes and Trees, from whence
they knock'd him down: when <HI>Lucilla</HI> seeing her∣self
void of all Defence, was for running away, but
was stopt by Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who used a great deal
of Violence to carry her away.</P>
<P>At this sight Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> more furious than a
young Lion robb'd of his Prey, flew on those two
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
base Adversaries, whom he soon laid sprawling on
the ground. What a Slaughter was here, four Men
dead on one side, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> on the other
without any sense of Life! Don <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
ran to him, and this Scene was no less melancholy
than that between him and the Count <HI>d'Aguilar;</HI>
neither was his Confusion any ways the less, for he
thought if he left his Friend, he should be guilty
of the greatest Baseness, and if he stay'd, he ran
the hazard of losing <HI>Lucilla</HI> again. But as he was
considering on what he should do, he heard a
noise, and looking about, perceiv'd it was his Gen∣tleman,
whom he had sent to get assistance to car∣ry
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> to a Friend's House that was hard by;
and in the mean time he obliged <HI>Lucilla</HI> to hide her∣self
in the thickest part of the Wood: and the
Dread he was in, after the Misfortune of two such
Friends, was inexpressible; he fear'd lest some Ill
should befall his Mistress, and that some Serpent or
venomous Creature should bite her. Alas! his Soul
was full of Grief and Distrust.</P>
<P>Tho Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> seem'd to be dead, yet Don <HI>Lew∣is</HI>
entertain'd some hopes of his Recovery, and fol∣low'd
after with <HI>Lucilla</HI> to his Friend's House, where,
by some Remedies that were apply'd, they brought
him out of his Swoon, and after searching his
Wounds, found none of them dangerous. Don <HI>Lewis</HI>
having thus put him into good hands, and knowing
that the Count was at a Gentleman's House he was
well known to, he left his Gentleman to take care
of them, and mounted his Horse again, accompanied
by two brave young Gentlemen, his Friend's Sons;
having first taken his leave of Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> and
thank'd him for the generous manner of his preserv∣ing
his <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and assured him <HI>Isidora</HI> should have
no other Person than him: and then went directly
for <HI>Portugal,</HI> where he married his beloved <HI>Lucilla.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the Grandfather and all his
Friends had got into Don <HI>Felix de Sarmiento</HI>'s House,
where they waited for Don <HI>Ferdinand de la Vega</HI>'s
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
bringing <HI>Lucilla</HI> back. When Night came, and was
far advanced, and they heard no News of him, they
grew uneasy, and sent to seek for him; but upon
hearing of his Misfortunes, both <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Grand∣father
and his Father express'd an unconsolable Af∣fliction;
and as they were both old, and wanted
that Vigour these sorts of Actions require, and were
no longer animated by the young Sparks that were
with them, they returned to <HI>Sevil,</HI> to pursue their
Proceedings against Don <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> she was so much enraged,
that she took the Road to <HI>Malaga,</HI> without letting
her Neices know where she was going, and car∣ried
them to a Convent, wherein she herself had
been educated: where after having had a little pri∣vate
Discourse with the Abbess, she put them in,
saying to them, “I would not tell you what reason
I had to complain of you, but depend upon it, I
know all, and am grieved to the heart, to think
that you should suffer those young Gentlemen, who
were disguised, so nigh you, who would have ru∣in'd
your Reputations; therefore I leave you here
to expiate so great an Offence, from whence you
shall not stir, unless by your Father's Orders.”
“Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Isidora, <HI>with a respectful Haughtiness,</HI>
we have done nothing wherewith we can reproach
ourselves; and if you know what has pass'd, you
are sensible also that we did not know the Names
of those Gentlemen till the Day before the Night
we came away. You may remember, that when
you determined to make them stay, we did all
we could to further their Departure; then how
could we have any Correspondence, since we
were so much vex'd to see them in our House?
'Tis true indeed, they have declared their Senti∣ments
without our being angry, since they are so
very advantageous to us; and had we the honour
of pleasing you, we should not neglect so favour∣able
an Opportunity.”</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127"/>
As Donna <HI>Juana</HI> could not bring any good Argu∣ments
to dispute with her Neices, she loaded them
with Injuries; for her Infatuation for the Count,
instead of diminishing by his Absence, rather in∣creas'd:
which, with the small Hopes she had to
engage him, made her perfectly outrageous. <HI>Isidora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia</HI> went into the Convent, where they
thought to have met with all the Liberty their ci∣vil
Behaviour deserv'd, but the Doors were no soon∣er
shut upon them, but they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old that they
were not to see any body, and were to be debarr'd
the use of Pen, Ink, and Paper, and were not
to be left alone; for Donna <HI>Juana</HI> had made the
Abbess believe, that some Persons very much beneath
them design'd to steal them away with their own
Consents, and that they could not be watch'd too
narrowly.</P>
<P>This Precaution was the main Cause why the
Old Lady's Designs had not their desir'd Effects;
the Abbess made choice of Ladies of the best Fa∣shion
among the Religious to be with these two
fair Prisoners; among them Donna <HI>Iphigenia d' Agui∣lar</HI>
was named as the chief, because she had Cor∣respondence
with none but her Relations, among
whom, such poor sorry Wretches as Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
represented her Neices Lovers to be, could not har∣bour.
Donna <HI>Iphigenia</HI> was endued with a great
share of Wit and Sweetness of Temper, who find∣ing
a great deal of Worth in her new Pupils, and
seeing them very melancholy, did all she could to
divert them. But it was not long before she stood
in need of the same piece of Service; for receiving
a Letter which the Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> her Brother had
order'd to be writ, in which he told her where he
was, never mentioning what Rencounter he had been
in, but only recommending himself to her Prayers,
telling her he was wounded, and in great pain, and
that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was in the same Condition; <HI>Isidora</HI>
observ'd her turn pale, and ask'd her the reason,
who told her she was very much griev'd, and gave
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
her the Letter, who, as soon as she read it, gave
a Shriek, and fell backwards into a great Chair;
whereupon <HI>Melanthia</HI> ran to her, and <HI>Isidora,</HI> with∣out
being able to speak, gave her the Letter, at
which <HI>Melanthia</HI> express'd no less Affliction than
her Sister.</P>
<P><HI>Iphigenia</HI> had never told them the Name of her
Family, her Modesty was too great to suffer her to
boast of Things which were not agreeable with a
religious Life; for that reason she had never men∣tion'd
the Count and Don <HI>Gabriel:</HI> but the Grief they
shew'd, exceeded so much that of a Friend, and
their Sensibility appear'd so great, that she could
not but attribute it to some Tenderness of another
nature; when looking at them without speaking,
<HI>Isidora</HI> guessing at her Thoughts, said, “Be not sur∣priz'd,
Madam, at our Condition; we are belov'd
by the Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> and Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> and must
own we have no Indifference for them, upon
whose account we are here: But, O Heavens!
were their Pains but as easy as ours!” “What! Are
my Brother and Cousin your Lovers, <HI>reply'd</HI> Iphi∣genia,
<HI>embracing them,</HI> and do you suffer upon their
accounts? How vex'd am I, that I knew it not
sooner! But alas! will you pardon my acting the
Part of a Spy over you? Undoubtedly you will
forgive me, <HI>continu'd she,</HI> for the care I will take
to accomplish your Desires.” “My Heart, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Melanthia, waited not for the Knowledge of your
Name, but by a secret Fore-knowledge, I think,
of your being related to the Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> and
Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> was inspired with a secret Tender∣ness
for you: but what shall we do to comfort
them?” “Write to them, <HI>answer'd</HI> Iphigenia, and I
will send a Messenger with your Letters. Your
Aunt has unluckily put you into wrong hands to
be very strictly obey'd.” <HI>Isidora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia</HI>
thank'd her for all her Favours, and without defer∣ring
a Moment writ the following Letters.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
<HEAD>Isidora to Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>“YOU will be as much surpriz'd to hear that I am
at the Convent of <HI>Jeronimites</HI> at <HI>Maloga,</HI> as I was
at your being wounded. What can have befallen
you, Sir, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince we parted? Was not that Separa∣tion
of it self painful enough, but it must be at∣tended
with other Misfortunes? If you love me,
neglect not a Life wherein I have as much Con∣cern
as you desire, but come hither as soon as you
are able, and be assur'd that you are never out of
my Thoughts.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Melanthia to the Count d'Aguilar.</HEAD>
<P>“YOU are at a distance, and in danger, too many
Misfortunes at once, alas, Sir! If partaking of
them would be any Comfort to you, how service∣able
should I be, since my Grief and Trouble are
so terrible, I shall have no Quiet till I see you
again.”</P>
<P>Afterwards they writ to their Brother, and <HI>Iphi∣genia</HI>
to hers; who, when she had made up her Pac∣ket,
sent a Person she could trust away with it.
We may easily suppose the Count's Joy at such un∣expected
and very acceptable News. which contri∣buted
more towards his Cure than all the Remedies
that were apply'd. Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who, as soon as
he was able to bear the Litter, was brought into
the same Chamber that the Count lay in, express'd
the utmost Joy at <HI>Isidora</HI>'s Kindness; and both de∣sir'd
the Gentleman at whose House they were, to
write down and inform those dear Ladies of all that
had pass'd since Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Departure. But as
ill as the Count was, he made a shift to scrall over
these few Words:</P>
<P>“YOU shall see me soon at your Feet, the most
respectful of all Lovers.”</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="130"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who was not so bad, he writ i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these Terms:</P>
<P>“WE thought of following you, when a thousand
Accidents have fallen out to stay us. But,
Madam, I cannot express the most agreeable Sur∣prize
I was in, to receive a Letter from you, and
my Transport of Joy at those Proofs of your Boun∣ty,
but by declaring my Passion, which is so vio∣lent,
that when I was upon the point of Death I
regretted nought but you. Happy should I be to
have any Part of your Esteem, since I am nothing
without you.”</P>
<P>The Messenger made all the haste he could to re∣lieve
<HI>Iphigenia</HI> and the two lovely Sisters out of their
Pain for the Cavaliers Healths. The tender Ex∣pressions
in their Letters had so great an effect up∣on
them, that they resolv'd to do Justice to their
Sentiments, and to love the Persons who adored
them; and to further their Marriage, writ in the
mind they were then in, to Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> who only
waited for their Consents to ask his Father's. Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> writ to his Father, who was then at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
and acquainted him with what he had done; who,
pleased that his Son had made choice of a virtuous
Lady, approv'd of all, and desir'd his Brother, the
Count of <HI>Leon,</HI> who was then at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to manage
that Affair for him.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Felix de Sarmiento</HI> found himself so much ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our'd
by the Match his Son propos'd for his Sisters,
that he thought it proper to go to <HI>Malaga,</HI> to re∣move
all Difficulties that might be started; for the
Proceedings against Don <HI>Lewis</HI> would not suffer him
to come into <HI>Andalusia.</HI> The Lovers and their Mi∣stresses
receiv'd the good News with all imaginable
Satisfaction. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count were soon
in a Condition to go to <HI>Malaga,</HI> where they found
the Count <HI>de Leon</HI> and Don <HI>Felix,</HI> who agreed very
well about the Fortunes and Settlements.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="131"/>
All this while the melancholy disconsolate <HI>Juana</HI>
cherish'd her own Poison at her Country Seat,
whither her Brother went to invite her to his
Daughters Weddings, which was such a Thunder∣clap
to her, that she could not forbear telling him
all that her Rage could invent; but Don <HI>Felix</HI> was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o well inform'd of all that had pass'd, that all her
Remonstrances and Menaces had no effect: which
she perceiving, she posted away to <HI>Sevil,</HI> and gave
all she had to <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Grand-father, and Don <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>'s
Father, to be a lasting Plague to her own
Family. But as they were not able to hurt Per∣sons
of such distinguished Worth and Quality, an
Accommodation was made, and the Marriages of
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> with <HI>Isidora,</HI> and the Count with <HI>Melan∣thia,</HI>
celebrated with all the Magnificence and Sa∣tisfaction
imaginable. For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> she had
been ruin'd by her Folly, if Don <HI>Felix</HI> had not hap∣pily
found out a way to appease Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s
Grand-father, who forgave Don <HI>Lewis</HI> his taking
away his Grand-daughter, and gave her to him in
Marriage; so that her Fortune return'd to the Fa∣mily
of the <HI>Sarmiento's</HI> again: Don <HI>Lewis</HI> out of Ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erosity
gave it her for her Life, and she retired to
the Convent of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> where she spent the

<P>Madam <HI>D</HI>—having made an end of her Story,
a great Collation was prepar'd in a green Arbor nigh

that they, as wise as they seem, have not yet

Misfortune of changing their Shapes some Days in
every Month, and assuming that of a Bird, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
or Fish.</P>
<P>On these fatal Days, when they are left a Prey
to the Cruelty of Men, it is often difficult for them
to save themselves from the Danger to which this
hard Necessity exposes them.</P>
<P>One of them, who transform'd herself into an
Eel, was unluckily taken by some Fishermen, who
put her presently into a Cistern of Water in the
middle of a fine Meadow, where they kept the Fish
reserv'd for the King's Table.</P>
<P><HI>Anguilletta,</HI> which was the Fairy's Name, found
there a great many fine Fish, and heard the Fisher∣men
say to one another, “that the King made that
night a great Entertainment, for which those Fish
had been carefully pick'd out.”</P>
<P>What dismal News was this for the unhappy Fai∣ry,
who accused her Fate a thousand times, and
sigh'd grievously when she got to the bottom, whi∣ther
she went that she might bewail her Misfor∣tune
the more privately? The desire of avoiding
the impending Danger, made her look abroad on all
sides, to see if there was any way to escape, and re∣gain
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
the River, which was but a small distance
from thence; but it prov'd all in vain, the Cistern
was too deep to hope to get out of it without As∣sistance:
and her Fears increased when she saw the
Fishermen, who took her, approaching, who put in
their Nets; and <HI>Anguilletta</HI> by avoiding them thought
only to defer her Death for some time.</P>
<P>At that Instant the King's youngest Daughter, who
was then walking in the Meadow, came to the Ci∣stern
to amuse herself with looking at the Fish;
when the Sun, which was then about setting, shi∣ning
in the Water, <HI>Anguilletta</HI>'s Skin, which was
streak'd with Gold, appear'd so bright, that the
Princess took notice of it, and finding it very
beautiful, bid the Fishermen take that Eel, and
give it her.</P>
<P>When the Princess had look'd on <HI>Anguilletta</HI> some
time, mov'd with Compassion, she ran to the River∣side,
and threw her in; which unhoped for Service
touch'd the Fairy's Heart with so lively an Ac∣knowledgment,
that she appear'd that very moment
on the top of the Water, and said to the Princess,
“I owe my Life to you, generous <HI>Plousina,</HI> (which
was the Name of the Princess) which is a great
Happiness for you. Be not afraid, <HI>continu'd she,</HI>
seeing her going to run away, I am a Fairy, and
will satisfy you in the truth of my words by
what I will do for you.”</P>
<P>As they were used to see Fairies in those Days,
<HI>Plousina</HI> took Courage, and gave great Attention to
<HI>Anguilletta</HI>'s agreeable Promises, and was about to
make some Answer; when the Fairy interrupting
her, said, “Stay till you have receiv'd my Favours,
before you assure me of your Acknowledgment.
Go, young Princess, and come here again to∣morrow
morning; wish for what you would have,
and I will as soon accomplish it: chuse either
perfect Beauty, a lively piercing Wit, or vast
Riches.” After these words, <HI>Anguilletta</HI> dived in
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
the Water, and left <HI>Plousina</HI> very well satisfied with
her Adventure.</P>
<P>She resolved to trust nobody with what had
happen'd to her; for said she to herself, “If <HI>An∣guilletta</HI>
should deceive me, my Sisters may think
this a Story I have invented.”</P>
<P>After this short Reflection she return'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
Train, which consisted only of a few Women, whom
she found looking for her.</P>
<P>All that Night the young <HI>Plousina</HI> was engag'd
in the Choice she was to make; that of Beauty
had a great Sway with her, but as she had Wit
enough to desire more, she resolved to ask th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Favour of the Fairy.</P>
<P>She rose next day with the Sun, ran to the Mea∣dow,
as she said, to gather Flowers to make a Gar∣land,
to present to her Mother when she was up.
But at the same time while her Women dispersed
themselves in the Meadow, which was all enamell'd,
to pick out the finest and sweetest Flowers, the
young Princess stole to the River-side, and found
at the place where she had seen the Fairy, a Pillar
of white Marble perfectly fine, which presently
open'd, and the Fairy came out of it; who was no
longer a Fish, but a beautiful Woman, of a majestick
Air, whose Head-dress and other Apparel were
cover'd over with Jewels: “I am <HI>Anguilletta, said
she to the young Princess, who lock'd at her with great
Attention,</HI> and come to perform my Promise; you
have made choice of Wit, you shall have from
this moment enough to deserve the Envy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all
those who hitherto have pretended to it.”</P>
<P>The young <HI>Plousina</HI> after these words found her∣self
quite different from what she was an Instant
before; she thank'd the Fairy with an Eloquence,
which till then she had never been Mistress of, the
Fairy smiling at the Princess's Amazement to find
so much ease in expressing herself.</P>
<P>“I am so well pleased, <HI>continu'd the kind</HI> Anguil∣letta,
at the Choice you have preferably made to
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
Beauty, which People of your Age are so much
delighted with, that to recompence you I will
bestow that Beauty on you, which you this day
have so prudently neglected. Come again to-mor∣row
at the same Hour, I give you that time to
chuse how beautiful you would be.”</P>
<P>Then the Fairy disappearing, left the young <HI>Plou∣sina</HI>
more pleased than ever: the Choice of Wit was
the effect of her Reason, but the Promise of Beauty
flatter'd her Heart; and what reaches that, we are
generally the most affected with.</P>
<P>The young Princess leaving the River-side, went
to receive the Flowers her Women presented her
with, of which she made a very agreeable Garland,
and carried it to the Queen; but how surprized
was that Princess, the King, and the whole Court,
when they heard the young <HI>Plousina</HI> speak with a
Grace that captivated their Hearts!</P>
<P>The Princesses her Sisters strove in vain to think
her less witty than others, but were forced to yield
even to their Astonishment and Admiration.</P>
<P>At night the Princess, possess'd with the Hopes
of being handsome, instead of going to Bed sat up
in her Closet, which was hung with Pictures, which
represented, under the Figures of Goddesses, all the
Queens and Princesses of her House; and as all
those Pictures were very fine, she hoped they might
be assisting to her in the choice of a Beauty worthy
of being ask'd of the Fairy.</P>
<P>A <HI>Juno</HI> presented herself first to her Eyes, fair,
and set off with an Air fit to represent the Queen
of the Gods; <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> were by her: this
Piece being the Judgment of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The young Princess was very much pleased with
the Pride and Stateliness of <HI>Pallas,</HI> but the Beauty
of <HI>Venus</HI> inclin'd her there to fix her Choice; ne∣vertheless
she passed on to the next, where she saw
<HI>Pomona</HI> leaning on a Bed of Turfs, under Trees
loaded with the finest Fruits, who seem'd so charm∣ing,
that the Princess, who since the morning knew
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>
every thing, was not surprized that a God had
assumed so many Shapes to strive to please her.</P>
<P><HI>Diana</HI> appear'd next, as represented by the Poets,
with a Quiver on her Back, and a Bow in her
Hand, pursuing a Stag, and follow'd by her
Nymphs.</P>
<P><HI>Flora</HI> appear'd a little more careful; she seem'd
walking in a Parterre, the Flowers of which, tho
admirable, came not up to her Complexion: next
her were the <HI>Graces,</HI> who look'd beautiful and en∣gaging.</P>
<P>But the Princess was most struck with a Picture
that hung over the Chimney, which was the God∣dess
of Youth; a charming Air appear'd thro the
whole Figure, the Hair was of the finest white,
the Turn of her Face admirable, the Mouth deli∣cate,
the Shape and Breasts perfectly fine and beau∣tiful,
and her Eyes appear'd more formidable to
disturb our Reason, than the Nectar she was feign'd
to pour out.</P>
<P>“I will, <HI>cry'd the young Princess, viewing that lovely
Portrait,</HI> be as beautiful as <HI>Hebe,</HI> and if possible as
lasting.”</P>
<P>After this she went into her Chamber, where
the Day she expected seem'd too slow to second her
Impatience; but at length appearing, she return'd
to the River-side, where the Fairy kept her word:
and throwing some Water in <HI>Plousina's</HI> Face, ren∣der'd
her as beautiful as she wish'd to be.</P>
<P>The first Effect of the fortunate <HI>Plousina's</HI> Charms,
was the Praises of some Sea-Gods that accompanied
the Fairy; she saw herself in the Water, and knew
not herself, her Silence and Amazement being then
the only Marks of her Acknowledgment. “I have
fulfilled all your Desires, <HI>said the generous Fairy to
her;</HI> you ought to be satisfied, but I shall not, till
I have exceeded your Desires by my Bounty.”</P>
<P>“I give you, with Wit and Beauty, all the Trea∣sures
in my disposal, which are inexhaustible;
wish only for what Riches you would have, and
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
you shall that minute obtain them both for your∣self,
and whoever you think fit.”</P>
<P>The Fairy afterwards disappear'd, and the young
<HI>Plousina,</HI> who was then as handsome as <HI>Hebe,</HI> re∣turn'd
to the Palace: All that met her were
charm'd, they told the King of her Arrival, who
admired her himself, but knew her by her Voice
and Wit; she inform'd him, that a Fairy had be∣stow'd
those invaluable Gifts on her, and that she
would be call'd <HI>Hebe,</HI> because she perfectly resem∣bled
the Picture of that Goddess.</P>
<P>What new Grounds of Hatred were here for her
Sisters! her Wit gave them less Jealousy than her
Beauty now.</P>
<P>All the Princes, who had been captivated by
their Charms, no longer balanced to become un∣faithful;
they forsook all the Beauties of that Court,
no Tears nor Reproaches could stay those fickle
Lovers: and this Proceeding, which at that time
appear'd so surprizing, hath since, they say, become
common. In short, they all burnt for <HI>Hebe,</HI> whose
Heart remain'd insensible.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Hatred of her Sisters, she
neglected nothing that might please them; she
wish'd for so much Treasure for the Eldest, (for to
wish and give was with her the same) that the
greatest Monarch of that Country ask'd that Prin∣cess
in Marriage, and the Wedding was consumma∣ted
with great Magnificence.</P>
<P>The King, <HI>Hebe's</HI> Father, being inclin'd to raise a
great Army, the Wishes of that fair Princess crown∣ed
all his Enterprizes with Success; his Kingdom
and Treasury became thereby very much enrich'd,
which render'd him a most formidable Prince.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the Divine <HI>Hebe,</HI> wearied with the
Hurry of a Court, went to spend some Months in a
pretty Box, some distance from the capital Town,
where she laid aside all Magnificence, contenting
herself with what was gallant, and of a charming
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>
Plainness; Nature there only embelish'd the Walks,
since Art was not then used.</P>
<P>A Wood surrounded this pretty Retreat, the Paths
of which had something wild in them, divided by
Brooks and little Rivulets, which formed natural
Cascades.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Hebe,</HI> walking often in this solitary
Wood, one day felt a secret Grief and Languish∣ing,
which never forsook her; she was ignorant of
the Cause of it, and sat herself down on the Grafs
by the Brook-side, the purling Noise of which en∣tertain'd
her Thoughts.</P>
<P>“What Chagrin, <HI>said she to herself,</HI> disturbs the Ex∣cess
of my Good-fortune? What Princess in the
World enjoys so perfect an Happiness as myself?
I have, by the Fairy's Bounty, all I wish'd for; I
can load all about me with Riches; all that see
me adore me, and yet my Heart possesses not quiet
Thoughts: I cannot imagine whence proceeds the
insupportable Disquiet, which hath for some time
opposed the Felicity of my Life.”</P>
<P>Thus the young Princess continually reflected,
till at length she resolved to go to the River, to
endeavour to see <HI>Anguilletta.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairy, accustomed to flatter her Desires, ap∣pear'd
on the Water, for it was one of those Days
when she was metamorphosed into a Fish.</P>
<P>“I behold you always with pleasure, young Prin∣cess,
<HI>said she to</HI> Hebe; I know you are come from
a very solitary Abode, and you appear to me lan∣guishing,
which is no ways agreeable with your
Fortune. What ails you, <HI>Hebe?</HI> tell me.” “I ail
nothing, <HI>reply'd the young Princess in Confusion;</HI> you
have heap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d too many Favours on me, to want any
thing to compleat the Happiness which you have
bestow'd upon me.”</P>
<P>“You fain would deceive me, <HI>answer'd the Fairy;</HI>
I know very well you are not content, but what
can you desire more? Merit my Bounty by a sin∣cere
Confession, and I promise to accomplish your
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>
Desires. “I know not what I would have, <HI>said
the charming</HI> Hebe; yet I am sensible, <HI>continued she,
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring her Eyes,</HI> I want something that is absolute∣ly
necessary to compleat my Happiness.”</P>
<P>“Oh! <HI>cry'd the Fairy,</HI> 'tis Love you desire; that
Passion only is capable of making you think so
fantastically as you do.</P>
<P>“A daugerous disposition! <HI>continued the prudent Fai∣ry;</HI>
you want Love, you shall have it, Hearts are
naturally but too much disposed to it: but let me
tell you, you will call on me in vain, to put an end
to that fatal Passion you think so great an Happi∣ness,
my Power extending not so far.”</P>
<P>“That matters no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>reply'd the young Princess hastily,
blushing and smiling at the same time:</HI> Alas! what
should I do with all the Riches you have given
me, if I, in my turn, might not contribute to ano∣ther's
Felicity?” At this Discourse the Fairy sigh'd,
and shrunk beneath the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Hebe</HI> return'd to her Solitude, with hopes that al∣ready
began to calm her Troubles; the Fairy's Me∣naces
somewhat disturbed her, but those wise Re∣flections
were soon chased away by others more
dangerous, but much more delightful.</P>
<P>When she came to her little Box, she found a
Messenger from the King, who sent for her to come
to Court the next day; the King and Queen re∣ceived
her with pleasure, and told her, that a
strange Prince in his Travels arriving at their Court,
they had a mind to make an Entertainment for
him, to shew other Courts the Magnificence of
theirs.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Hebe,</HI> in a Trouble she could not ac∣count
for, ask'd her Sister at first if the Stranger
was handsome: “You never saw any thing like
him,” <HI>answer'd the Princess.</HI> “Describe him to me,”
“<HI>reply'd</HI> Hebe <HI>in disorder.</HI> “He is such as they feign
Heroes to be, <HI>answer'd</HI> Ileria; his Shape is fine,
his Air noble, his Eyes full of Fire, which the
Power of one of the most insensible Ladies of the
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
Court hath already confessed; he has a very fine
Head of brown Hair, and needs but shew himself
to gain the Attention of all that see him.”</P>
<P>“You set him off to the best advantage, <HI>reply'd
Hebe;</HI> do not you flatter him?” “No, Sister, <HI>an∣swer'd
the Princess</HI> Ileria, <HI>with a Sigh she could not re∣tain:</HI>
alas! you will find him but too worthy of
pleasing.”</P>
<P>At night the Prince paid the Queen a Visit, who
presented him to <HI>Hebe,</HI> whom he had not seen; but
never were two Hearts so soon, or so sensibly touch'd,
or ever had more reason.</P>
<P>The Conversation was on indifferent Subjects, but
bright and agreeable, and supported by all that Vi∣vacity
the Desire of pleasing could inspire.</P>
<P>When the Queen retired, and the fair <HI>Hebe</HI> had
time to make some Reflections, she was sensible she
had lost that Tranquillity which she knew not the
value of. “Oh! <HI>Anguilletta, cry'd she as soon as alone;</HI>
what an Object have you permitted me to behold?
Your sage Counsels are destroy'd by his Presence.
Why gave you me not Strength to resist such
Charms? But perhaps their Power exceeds that
of a Fairy.” <HI>Hebe</HI> slept but little that night, she
rose very early, and the Care of dressing her against
the Entertainment at night, amazed her all that
day with an Attention she was ignorant of till then;
she being willing to please, for the first time, the
young Stranger, whose Desires were the same, for∣got
nothing that might render him amiable in the
charming <HI>Hebe's</HI> Eyes. The Princess <HI>Ileria,</HI> on her
part, neglected nothing that might please; she was
Mistress of a thousand Beauties, and when <HI>Hebe</HI>
was absent, appear'd the most charming Person in
the whole World; but that Princess a Presence ef∣faced
them all.</P>
<P>At night there was a noble Entertainment, fol∣low'd
by a fine Ball, and the young Stranger had
without dispute taken notice of the Magnificence,
could he have regarded any thing but the beautiful
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="141"/>
After the Repast, there was a fine Illumination,
which gave as great a light in the Gardens of the
Palace, as if it had been Day. They went to
take a pleasant Walk. The lovely Stranger gave
the Queen his Hand, but that Honour did not make
amends for the Chagrin of being separated a mo∣ment
from his Princess. The Trees were cover'd
with Festons of Flowers, and the Lamps which
gave the light, were disposed in such a manner,
as to represent Bows and Arrows, and other Arms
of Love, and in some Places form'd Lines of Wri∣ting.</P>
<P>They went into a little Wood illuminated like
the Gardens, where the Queen sat herself down
by an agreeable Fountain, about which, there
were placed Seats of Turfs, adorn'd with Garlands
of Pinks and Roses. While the Queen talk'd with
the King, with a great Croud of Courtiers about
them, the Princesses amused themselves with look∣ing
at some Characters the little Lamps form'd;
the amiable Stranger standing then by the charming
<HI>Hebs,</HI> who casting her Eyes on a Place where Ar∣rows
were represented, read aloud these Words
which were written under them,</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>They are invincible.</HEAD>
<P>“Such are the Darts shot from the divine <HI>Hebe's</HI>
Eyes,” <HI>said the unknown Prince, looking on her tenderly.</HI>
The Princess heard him, and was confused, but
her Embarassment seem'd to the Prince a happy
Presage to his Love; he having observed no An∣ger.</P>
<P>When the Diversions were over, the Charms of
the Stranger had too sensibly touch'd the Heart of
<HI>Ileria,</HI> for her not to perceive he lov'd another.
Before <HI>Hebe's</HI> coming to Court, that Prince had
reader'd her some little Favours, but since that,
had been altogether taken up with his Tenderness
for <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142"/>
In the mean time, this young Stranger endea∣vour'd
by his Love to move the Heart of the
beautiful Princess; he was in love, amiable, and
his Fate oblig'd him to love, and the Fairy aban∣doning
her to the Inclination of her Heart, what
Excuses were there for her to yield, who could
not long hold out against herself.</P>
<P>The charming Stranger told her he was a King's
Son, and was call'd <HI>Atimir;</HI> whose Name was well
known to the Princess; for that Prince had done
Wonders, in a War between the two Kingdoms,
and as they had always been Enemies, he went
not by his true Name at her Father's Court.</P>
<P>The young Princess, after a Conversation,
wherein her Heart had fully receiv'd the sweet and
dangerous Poison the Fairy had spoke to her of,
permitted <HI>Atimir</HI> to discover to the King his Rank
and Love; who, transported with Joy, ran to the
King, and spoke to him with all the Ardour his
Tenderness could inspire.</P>
<P>The King conducted him to the Queen. Before
this Marriage, a lasting Peace was made, and the
beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> was promised to her happy Lover,
as soon as he had receiv'd his Father's Consent.
This News being spread abroad, the Princess
<HI>Ileria</HI> felt a Grief equal to her Jealousy; she cry'd
and groan'd, but was forc'd to constrain herself,
and conceal her useless Grief.</P>
<P>The charming <HI>Hebe</HI> and <HI>Atimir</HI> seeing one another
every day, their Tenderness augmented, and, at
that happy time, the Princess could not compre∣hend,
why the Fairies, when they would compleat
the Happiness of Mortals, should not use all their
Art and Knowledge to make them love.</P>
<P>An Ambassador from <HI>Atimir's</HI> Father arrived at
Court, who had been expected with great Impa∣tience,
and brought with him his Consent; every
thing was prepared for the Marriage, and <HI>Atimir</HI>
had nothing to fear: a dangerous State for a Lover
one would preserve faithful!</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="143"/>
The Prince thus assured of his Happiness, became
somewhat less sensible; one day as he was looking
for <HI>Hebe</HI> in the Gardens of the Palace, he heard the
Voices of some Women in a Summer-Box of
Honey suckles and hearing his Name mention'd,
which excited his Curiosity to know more, he
drew nigh to them, and heard the Princess <HI>Ileria</HI>
say to a Person that was with her, “I shall die
before that fatal day, my dear <HI>Cleonice:</HI> the Gods
will not permit me to see the ungrateful Man
whom I love, united to the too happy <HI>Hebe:</HI> My
Torments are too grievous for my Life to endure
much longer.” “But, Madam, <HI>answered the Dam∣sel,</HI>
the Prince <HI>Atimir</HI> is not unfaithful, he never
made you any Vows, Fate alone is the Cause of
your Misfortunes, and, among so many Princes
that adore you, you may find more amiable than
him, if a fatal Prevention possesses not your
Heart.”</P>
<P>“Is there any in the whole World so lovely as
him? <HI>reply'd</HI> Ileria. Powerful Fairy! <HI>added she with
a Sigh,</HI> of all the Favours you have bestow'd on
the fortunate <HI>Hebe,</HI> I only envy <HI>Atimir's</HI> Love.”</P>
<P>This Discourse of the Princess's was interrupted
by her Tears. Alas! how happy had she been,
had she known how much she touch'd the Heart of
<HI>Atimir?</HI></P>
<P>She started up to go out of the Box, and the
Prince hid himself behind some Trees. The Tears
and Passion of <HI>Ileria</HI> had softened his Heart, which
he look'd upon then, only as Compassion, in favour
of a beautiful Princess, whom he, against his Will,
had made unhappy. Afterwards he went and found
<HI>Hebe,</HI> whose Charms suspended all other Thoughts
at that time.</P>
<P>In crossing the Gardens to return to the Palace,
he found something under his feet, which he took
up, and found it to be a fine Pocket-Book. It
was not far off the Box where he heard the Con∣versation
of <HI>Ileria,</HI> therefore he fear'd to shew the
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>
Pocket-Book, lest he should give <HI>Hebe</HI> any Know∣ledge
of that Adventure; but hid it from that
Princess, who was then employ'd in doing some∣thing
to her Head-dress.</P>
<P>That Night <HI>Ileria</HI> went not to the Queen, who
was told she was not very well after walking;
and <HI>Atimir</HI> comprehended that she had a mind
to conceal the Disorder he had seen her in at
the Box, which Thought▪ redoubled his Compas∣sion.</P>
<P>As soon as he got to his Apartment, he open'd
the Pocket-Book he had found, and on the first
Leaf found a Cypher of a double <HI>A,</HI> crown'd
with Myrrh, and supported by two Loves, one of
which seem'd to wipe his Eyes, and the other to
break his Arrows.</P>
<P>The Sight of this Cypher moved the young
Prince, he knew very well what <HI>Ileria</HI> meant,
turn'd over the next Leaf to know more, and
found these Words writ on the backside:
<Q><L>Almighty Love, your Charms display'd,</L>
<L>Which did my easy Heart invade:</L>
<L>Ah Cruel! thus your Power to prove,</L>
<L>And bless another with your Love.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Hand, which he knew very well, inform'd
him it was the Princess <HI>Ileria's</HI> Book, he was
touch'd with those tender Sentiments, which, far
from being supported by his Love and Care, were
not so much as supported by Hope. These Verses
put him in mind, that before <HI>Hebe's</HI> Arrival at the
Court, he thought <HI>Ileria</HI> amiable; he began to
look upon himself as false to that Princess, and
indeed became too much so to the charming
<HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>However, he opposed the first Emotions, but his
Heart was used to be fickle, and we seldom are
capable of breaking ourselves of an ill Habit.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="145"/>
He threw <HI>Ileria's</HI> Pocket-Book upon the Table,
resolved never to look into it, but took it up a∣gain
in spite of himself, a moment afterwards, and
found in it a thousand things which compleated
<HI>Ileria's</HI> Triumph over the Divine <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>A thousand confused Thoughts possess'd the
Prince's Heart all night: In the morning he waited
on the King, who appointed the day of his Mar∣riage
with <HI>Hebe. Atimir</HI> answered with a Confu∣sion,
which the King took for a Mark of his Love.
How hard is it to know the Hearts of Men, since
what Confusion was the Effect of his Infidelity!</P>
<P>The King was going to the Queen, and the
Prince was obliged to follow him. He had not
been there long, when the Princess <HI>Ileria</HI> appear∣ing
with a languishing Look, which the unconstant
<HI>Atimir</HI> knowing too well the Cause of, rendered
her more lovely in his Eyes; he made up to her,
talk'd to her a long while, and inform'd her he
was not ignorant of her Sentiments for him, and
afterwards explain'd himself to her with a Tender∣ness,
which was an Happiness too great, and but
little expected by <HI>Ileria.</HI></P>
<P>The charming <HI>Hebe</HI> came in at the same time;
the Sight of her made the Princess <HI>Ileria</HI> and the
light <HI>Atimir</HI> blush. “How handsome she is! <HI>said</HI>
“Ileria, <HI>looking on the Prince with an Emotion she could
not conceal.</HI> Fly hence, Sir, or deprive me quite
of Life.” To which the Prince could make no
answer. When <HI>Hebe</HI> approached with an Air and
Charms, which cast a thousand Reproaches on the
ungrateful <HI>Atimir,</HI> all which he could not support▪
He left the Princess, and told her he was going
to dispatch a Courier to the King his Father; and
she for her part, being prepossess'd in his favour,
observed not those Looks he sometimes cast <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Ileria.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Ileria</HI> triumph'd secretly, the fair <HI>Hebe</HI> was
told by the King and Queen, she was to be mar∣ried
to <HI>Atimir</HI> in three days. But how unworthy
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>
was he then of the Sentiments that News created
in the Heart of the lovely <HI>Hebe?</HI></P>
<P>The Prince, tho possess'd with a false Passion,
spent part of the day with <HI>Hebe;</HI> and <HI>Ileria,</HI> who
knew of it, thought she should have dy'd a thou∣sand
times for Jealousy; her Love redoubling when∣ever
she had any the least Hope.</P>
<P>As the Prince was going into his Apartment
at night, he receiv'd a Letter from an unknown
Man, which he open'd in haste, and found these
Words in it.</P>
<P>“I yield to a Passion a thousand times more strong
than my Reason, but since it is in vain to con∣ceal
those Sentiments from you, which Chance
hath discover'd; come, Prince, and know the
Resolution my tender Love hath made me take.
How happy should I be, if it cost me but my
Life!”</P>
<P>The Person that brought this Letter told him,
he was ordered to conduct him where the Prin∣cess
<HI>Ileria</HI> waited for him. <HI>Atimir,</HI> without con∣sidering
a moment, follow'd him. After a great
many Turnings and Windings, they came to a
small Pavilion full of Lights, which was at the
end of a close shaded Alley; where he found
<HI>Ileria</HI> with only one of her Women, the rest being
gone to walk in the Garden.</P>
<P><HI>Ileria</HI> was sat on a crimson Cushion embroider'd
with Gold; her Dress, which was both gallant and
magnificent, was yellow and silver Tissue; her
fine black Hair was dress'd with Ribbons of the
same Colour as her Clothes, intermix'd with Dia∣monds.
At the sight of her, <HI>Atimir</HI> ashamed of
being false, fell on his Knees by her, and <HI>Ileria</HI>
looking on him with a Tenderness that sufficiently
betray'd the Sentiments of her Heart, said, “Prince,
I sent for you not to persuade you to break off
your Marriage, I know too well 'tis resolved
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
on: but since some words which you was pleased
to flatter my Misfortune and Tenderness with, do
not permit me to believe you will leave <HI>Hebe</HI> for
me;” yet, <HI>continu'd she with Tears, that entirely sedu∣ced
“the Heart of</HI> Atimir, I will sacrifice to my Love
without regret a Life you have render'd so pain∣ful
to me; and this Poison, <HI>shewing a little golden
Box she held in her Hand,</HI> shall secure me from the
frightful Punishment of seeing you <HI>Hebe's</HI> Spouse.”</P>
<P>“No, beautiful <HI>Ileria, cry'd the fickle Prince,</HI> I will
not be hers, I will leave her to please you, whom
I love a thousand times better; and notwithstand∣ing
my Duty and Faith so solemnly given, I am
ready to conduct you where nothing shall con∣strain
our Love.” “Alas Prince! <HI>said</HI> Heria <HI>sighing,</HI>
shall I trust myself with one so false?” “I will
never be so to you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Atimir, and the King
your Father, who gave me <HI>Hebe,</HI> will not refuse
me the lovely <HI>Ileria,</HI> when she shall be in my
power.” “Let us go then, <HI>Atimir, said the Princess,
after some time of Silence,</HI> let us go where our Fate
hurries us; whatever I may suffer, nothing can
balance in my Heart the sweet Pleasure of being
ador'd by the Man I love.”</P>
<P>After these words they consulted Measures for
their Departure, and having no Time to lose, they
resolved on the Night following. They parted with
a great deal of Reluctancy: and notwithstanding
<HI>Atimir's</HI> Oaths, <HI>Ileria</HI> yet dreaded <HI>Hebe's</HI> Charms;
and was the remainder of the Night, and the Day
following, continually possess'd with that Fear.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince gave all necessary
Orders for their secret Departure; and the next
Night, when every body was retired in the Palace,
went to <HI>Ileria's</HI> Pavillion in the Garden, where she
waited for him, attended only by <HI>Cleonice.</HI> They
went away, and with incredible Speed got out of
the Kingdom. In the Morning this News was
made known by a Letter <HI>Ileria</HI> writ to the Queen,
and one writ by <HI>Atimir</HI> to the King; which were
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
very moving, and easily discover'd that Love was
the Dictator. The King and Queen were in an
extreme Rage; but Words are not capable to ex∣press
the piercing Griefs of the unfortunate and
charming <HI>Hebe:</HI> How great was her Despair, and
how many her Tears! What Vows did she not of∣fer
to the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> to put an end to those
cruel Calamities she had foretold! <HI>Hebe</HI> return'd
in vain to the River-side; <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> who was as
good as her word, never appear'd, but abandon'd
her to the most frightful Despair. The Princes,
whom the ungrateful <HI>Atimir's</HI> good Fortune had
discarded, took fresh Hopes, and their Cares and
Love seem'd new Torments to the faithful <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>The King desired her passionately to make choice
of a Spouse, and oftentimes press'd her to it; but
this Duty appear'd too cruel to her Tenderness, she
resolv'd to leave her Father's Kingdom, but before
her Departure went once again to find <HI>Anguilletta.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairy, who this time could not resist the
Tears of the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> appear'd; at the sight
of her the Princess renew'd her Tears, having no
power to speak to her: “You know now, <HI>said the
Fairy,</HI> what that fatal Happiness is, which I was
always willing to refuse you; but <HI>Hebe, Atimir</HI> has
punish'd you but too well for not following my
Advice: Go and avoid this place, which calls into
your remembrance all your Tenderness; you will
find a Vessel by the Sea-side that will carry you to
the only Place in the World, where you may be
cured of this unhappy Passion that causes your
Despair; but remember, <HI>added</HI> Anguilletta, <HI>raising
her Voice,</HI> that when your Heart is easy and quiet,
you never seek after the fatal Presence of <HI>Atimir,</HI>
which will cost you your Life.” <HI>Hebe</HI> wish'd more
than once to see that Prince once again, whatever
that Pleasure should cost her; but some Remains of
Reason, and Value of her Honour, made her resolve
to accept of the Fairy's Proposal. She thank'd her
for this last Kindness, and went the next day to
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
the Sea-side, attended by those Women she had the
greatest Confidence in.</P>
<P>There she found <HI>Anguilletta's</HI> Vessel, all gilt with
Gold, the Masts of inlaid Work, the Sails of Silver
and Rose-colour'd Tissue, on which were writ <HI>Li∣berty.</HI>
The Sailors Jackets were of the same Colour
as the Sails, and every thing seem'd to breathe the
Sweets of Liberty.</P>
<P>The Princess went into a magnificent Cabin, the
Furniture of which was admirable, and the Paint∣ings
perfectly fine. She still afflicted herself as
much in this new Abode as in her Father's Court;
they endeavour'd to divert her by a thousand Plea∣sures,
but the State she was in would not permit
her to give any Attention to them.</P>
<P>One day as she was amusing herself in looking
on some Paintings in the Cabin, in a place that re∣presented
a Landskip, she observ'd a young Shep∣herdess
with a smiling Air cutting of Nets, to set
some Birds at liberty that were taken; and some
of those little Creatures that were escap'd, seem'd
to fly towards Heaven with a wonderful Swiftness.
The other Paintings seem'd to represent such like
Subjects, nothing seem'd to speak of Love, but all
boasted of the Charms of Liberty; which made the
Princess in a melancholy Tone say, “Will my Heart
be always insensible for so sweet an Happiness,
for which my Reason makes such vain Efforts?</P>
<P>Thus the unhappy <HI>Hebe</HI> lived possess'd with her
Tenderness, and at the same time with the desire
of forgetting it.</P>
<P>They had been about a Month at Sea, when one
Morning as the Princess was upon Deck, she dis∣cern'd
at a distance a Coast that seem'd very plea∣sant;
the Trees were of a surprizing Height and
Beauty, and when they were nearer she observed
they were full of Birds, the Plumage of which was
of a bright shining Colour; they made a charming
Concert, their Songs being so sweet, that they
seem'd as if they fear'd to make too great a noise.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="150"/>
When they arriv'd at this Shore, the Princess and
her Women landed, where she no sooner breathed
the Air of that Island, but she felt a perfect Tran∣quillity
in her Breast, and suffer'd herself to be
surprized by an agreeable Sleep, which closed her
Eyes for some time.</P>
<P>This agreeable Country, which was to her un∣known,
was the <HI>peaceable Island,</HI> which the Fairy
<HI>Anguilletta,</HI> who was a near Relation to the Princes
that govern'd there, had endow'd for above two
thousand Years with the happy Gift of curing the
most unfortunate Passions, and assured them that
Gift should still continue; but the difficulty was to
get to that Island.</P>
<P>While the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> enjoy'd a Repose she
had not tasted the Sweets of for six Months before,
the Prince of the <HI>peaceable Island</HI> was taking the Air
in that Wood which bordered by the Sea-side, in
his Chariot, drawn by four white young Elephants,
and attended by his Court.</P>
<P>There he saw the Princess asleep; her Beauty
surprized him. He alighted out of his Chariot with
a Precipitation and Vivacity he never felt till then.
He took at that sight all the Love the Charms of
<HI>Hebe</HI> were worthy of inspiring. The noise awa∣ken'd
her, and she opening her Eyes, discover'd a
thousand new Beauties to the young Prince. He
was about the same Age of <HI>Hebe,</HI> which was nine∣teen:
his Beauty was perfect; a thousand Graces
were in all his Actions; his Shape extraordinary;
and his Hair, which hung in large Rings down to
the middle of his Back, was of the same Colour as
<HI>Hebe's.</HI> His Habit was made of Feathers of a thou∣sand
different Colours; he had over it a kind of
Cloke, that trailed on the Ground, made of Swans
Feathers, buckled on the Shoulders by very fine
Diamonds. His Belt was all of Diamonds, on which
hung by Chains of Gold a small Sabre cover'd over
with Rubies. He had a kind of Headpiece, made
of Feathers like the rest, on which was button'd by
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
a very large Diamond some Herons Feathers, which
set it off with greater Splendor.</P>
<P>This Prince was the first Object that presented it
self to the young Princess when she awaken'd. He
appear'd to her worthy of her Regard, and it was
the first time in all her Life that ever she look'd
on any other but <HI>Atimir</HI> with any Attention.</P>
<P>“Every thing assures me, <HI>said the Prince of the
peaceable Island to the Princess,</HI> that you are the Di∣vine
<HI>Hebe:</HI> Alas! who besides could boast so many
Charms?” Who could, Sir, so soon inform you,
“<HI>answer'd the young Princess, getting up and blushing at
the same time,</HI> that I was in this Island?” “A pow∣erful
Fairy, <HI>reply'd the young King,</HI> who, willing to
make me the happiest of Men, and this Country
most fortunate, promised me to conduct you here,
and hath permitted me yet more glorious Hopes.”
“But I am very sensible, <HI>added he sighing,</HI> that my
Fate depends more on your Bounty than hers.”
After these words, to which she answer'd with a
great deal of Wit, the Prince desired her to go in∣to
his Chariot, which should carry her to the Pa∣lace,
and out of Respect went not into it himself:
but as she understood by his Discourse, and by his
Train, that he was the King of that Isle, she obli∣ged
him to sit by her.</P>
<P>Never any thing appear'd so beautiful in one
Chariot; all the Prince's Court at that sight could
not forbear their Applauses. While they were on
the way, the young Prince entertain'd <HI>Hebe</HI> with a
great deal of Wit and Tenderness; and the Prin∣cess,
satisfied to find her Heart at ease, resumed all
her Vivacity.</P>
<P>They arriv'd at the Palace, which was some di∣stance
from the Sea, and built all of Ivory, and
cover'd with Agate, all the Avenues to which were
encompassed with fine Canals.</P>
<P>The Prince's Guards were drawn out in all the
Courts; in the first they were clothed in yellow
Feathers, with Head-pieces, Bows and Arrows, all
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
of Silver; in the second they were clothed in Fea∣thers
of a Fire-colour, with gilt Sabres, adorn'd
with Turquoises. When they came into the third
Court, the Guards were clothed in white Feathers,
holding in their Hands gilded and painted Half∣pikes,
adorn'd with Garlands of Flowers, for in that
Country they never were in War, therefore bore
no terrible Arms.</P>
<P>The Prince alighted out of his Chariot, and led
the amiable <HI>Hebe</HI> into a magnificent Apartment.
The Court was numerous, the Ladies beautiful,
the Men gallant and handsome: and tho all the In∣habitants
of the Country were clothed with Fea∣thers,
the Art of forming them in Shades made them
very agreeable.</P>
<P>That night the Prince of the peaceable Island
made a great Entertainment for the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI>
which was follow'd by a Concert of sweet Flutes,
Lutes, Theorboes and Harpsicords; for in that
Country they lov'd not noisy Instruments: the Sym∣phony
was very fine, and when it had lasted some
time, a delicate fine Voice sung some Words which
declared the Prince's Passion, while he gaz'd on
<HI>Hebe,</HI> to persuade her those Words express'd his
Thoughts.</P>
<P>As it was late when the Musick left off, the
Prince led the Princess into the Apartment ap∣pointed
for her, which was the finest in the Palace;
there she found a great Number of Ladies, whom
the Prince had named to have the honour to be her
Attendants.</P>
<P>The Prince left the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> the most in
love of all Men. They put her to Bed; the Ladies
retired, and only left in the Chamber those she
brought along with her. “Who could believe it,
<HI>said she to them when she was at liberty,</HI> my Heart is
at peace! What God hath calm'd my Troubles?
I love <HI>Atimir</HI> no longer; I can think without dy∣ing
with Grief, that he is, perhaps, <HI>Ileria's</HI> Spouse.
Is not all I see a Dream? No, <HI>said she, recovering
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>
herself a little,</HI> my Dreams used not to be so quiet.”
In short, she return'd <HI>Anguilletta</HI> a thousand thanks,
and then went to sleep.</P>
<P>The next Morning when she awaked, as she
open'd the Bed-curtain, the Fairy appear'd to her
with a smiling Air, which she had never observ'd
in her Face since that fatal day she ask'd for Love.
“At last I have happily brought you hither, <HI>said
the amiable Fairy to her,</HI> your Heart is free, there∣fore
will be content. I have cured you of a cruel
Passion. But <HI>Hebe,</HI> can I be assur'd that these ter∣rible
Torments, to which you have been expos'd,
will make you always avoid the sight of the un∣grateful
<HI>Atimir?</HI>”</P>
<P>The young Princess promised the Fairy every
thing, and swore both against Love and her false
Lover. “Remember your Promises, <HI>reply'd</HI> Anguil∣letta,
<HI>with an Air that left an Impression of Respect,</HI> you
will perish with <HI>Atimir</HI> if ever you seek to see him
again. But every thing here ought to remove a
Desire so fatal to your Life.”</P>
<P>“I will no longer conceal from you what I have
resolved in your favour: The Prince of this
Island is my Relation, I protect his Person and
Empire: He is young and amiable, and no Prince
in the World is more worthy of being your Hus∣band.
Reign then, beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> in his Heart and
Kingdom: The King your Father gives his Con∣sent;
I was yesterday at his Palace, and acquaint∣ed
him and the Queen your Mother with the
present State of your Fortune, which they have
put absolutely under my Care.”</P>
<P>The Princess had a great mind to have ask'd the
Fairy about <HI>Ileria</HI> and <HI>Atimir,</HI> but durst not, after so
many Favours, run the hazard of displeasing her;
therefore she only made use of all the Wit she had
bestow'd on her to thank her.</P>
<P>Then somebody coming into the Room the Fairy
disappear'd. As soon as <HI>Hebe</HI> was up, twelve Chil∣dren
cloth'd like Cupids brought from the Prince
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
twelve Baskets of Chrystal, full of the most agree∣able
Flowers, which only garnish'd some Jewels of
a wonderful beauty. In the first Basket that was
presented to her, this Billet was found:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To the Divine Hebe.</HEAD>
<P>“YEsterday I swore a thousand times how I loved,
the sweet remembrance of which Oaths will
ever remain, since they were dictated by Love,
and are supported by your Charms.”</P>
<P>After what the Fairy had order'd the Princess,
she comprehended that she ought to accept of her
new Lover as of a Prince, who was shortly to be
her Husband.</P>
<P>She received the little Loves very favourably;
and had hardly dismiss'd them, when four and twenty
Dwarfs, fantastically, but magnificently cloth'd,
appear'd loaded with new Presents, that consisted
of Habits all of Feathers; the Colours and Work of
which with Jewels were so fine, that the Princess
own'd she had never seen any thing so gallant.</P>
<P>She made choice of a Rose-colour to wear that
day; her Head-dress was adorn'd with a Plume of
Feathers of the same Colour, and she appear'd so
charming with this new Ornament, that the Prince
of the <HI>peaceable Island,</HI> who came to see her when
she was dress'd, felt his Passion redouble. All the
Court crouded to admire the Princess. At night
the Prince proposed to the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> to walk
in the Gardens, which were admirable, where the
Prince told <HI>Hebe</HI> that the Fairy had fed him for four
Years with the hopes of her Arrival in the <HI>peaceable
Island;</HI> “But some time after, <HI>added the Prince,</HI> when
I press'd her on her Promises, she appear'd sad,
and told me, the Princess is design'd by the King
her Father for another, and not for thee: but, if
my Knowledge deceives me not, she will not be
that Prince's.” I will tell you more another time.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155"/>
Some Months after the Fairy came again: “For∣tune
favours you, <HI>said she to me,</HI> the Prince that
was to have been, will not be <HI>Hebe's</HI> Spouse; and
in a little time you will see here the most beauti∣ful
Princess in the World.”</P>
<P>“Indeed▪ <HI>reply'd</HI> Hebe <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lushing,</HI> I was to have been
married to the Son of a neighbouring King; but
after a great many Events, the Love he bore my
Sister made him resolve to go away with her.”</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>peaceable Island</HI> said a thousand
tender things to the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> on his happy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are, which, according with what the Fairy had
told him, had brought her into his Isle; and she
hearken'd to him with so much the more Pleasure,
because this Discourse interrupted the recital of her
Adventures: she fearing she should not be able to
speak of her faithless Lover, without discovering
the Tenderness she had had for him.</P>
<P>The Prince conducted <HI>Hebe</HI> into a Grotto, curi∣ously
adorn'd and embelish'd with the Spourings
of Water. The bottom of the Grotto was dark;
there was a great number of Niches with Statues,
representing Nymphs and Shepherds, which were
hard to be distinguish'd. When the Princess had
been there some time, she heard a delightful Sound
of Instruments. A noble Illumination that appear'd
all on a sudden, discover'd to her, that part of those
Statues form'd that Concert; when the others came
out, and danced fine and gallant Dances, inter∣mix'd
with tender and agreeable Songs: all the
Performers in this Diversion being placed at the
botton of the Grotto, surprized the Princess the
more agreeab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P>After the Dance, Savages came in, and served up
a stately Collation under an Arbor of Jessamins and
Orange-flowers.</P>
<P>The Entertainment was just over, when all on a
sudden the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta</HI> appear'd in the Air, in a
Chariot drawn by four Swans; and descending pro∣nounced
to the Prince of the <HI>peaceable Island</HI> a
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
charming Happiness, in telling him she would have
him marry <HI>Hebe,</HI> and withal, that that Princess had
promised her to consent.</P>
<P>The Prince, transported with Joy, doubted at
first to whom he should return his first Thanks,
whether to <HI>Hebe</HI> or <HI>Anguilletta;</HI> and tho Joy permits
not of touching Expressions like Grief, he acquit∣ted
himself however with a great deal of Wit, and
a good Grace.</P>
<P>The Fairy had no mind to leave the Prince and
Princess till the Day appointed for their Marriage,
which was to be in three Days; when she made
them both costly Presents, and went with them,
who were follow'd by all the Court, and a great
many of the Inhabitants of the Isle, to the Temple
of <HI>Hymen,</HI> which was made of Olive-Branches and
Palms interlaced together, which by the Fairy's
Power never faded.</P>
<P><HI>Hymen</HI> was there, represented by a Statue of white
Marble, crown'd with Roses, and raised on an Al∣tar
adorn'd only with Flowers, and supported by a
<HI>Cupid</HI> of extraordinary Beauty, who with a smiling
Air presented him with a Crown of Myrtle.</P>
<P><HI>Anguilletta,</HI> who built this Temple, was willing
every thing should be plain, to shew that Love
alone can render Marriage happy. The Difficulty
is not to unite them together, but as a Miracle wor∣thy
of a Fairy, to join them together for ever in the
<HI>peaceable Island;</HI> which, contrary to the Customs of
other Countries, can make Man and Wife loving
and constant.</P>
<P>In this Temple of <HI>Hymen</HI> the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> led
by <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> plighted her Faith to the Prince of
the <HI>peaceable Island,</HI> and receiv'd his with Pleasure.
She had not that involuntary Inclination for him
that she felf for <HI>Atimir;</HI> but her Heart, then exempt
from Passion, accepted of that Spouse, by the Fairy's
Order, as a Prince worthy of her by his Person,
and much more by his Love. This Marriage was
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
celebrated by a thousand gallant Entertainments,
and <HI>Hebe</HI> liv'd happy with a Prince that ador'd her.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King, <HI>Hebe's</HI> Father, re∣ceiv'd
Ambassadors from <HI>Atimir,</HI> who ask'd leave to
marry the Princess <HI>Ileria</HI> (for his Father was dead,
and he left absolute Master of his Kingdom) which
was granted with Joy.</P>
<P>After this Marriage the Queen <HI>Ileria</HI> ask'd, by
new Ambassadors, leave of the King her Father, and
Queen her Mother, to come to their Court to beg
pardon for a Fault which Love had made her com∣mit,
and for which <HI>Atimir's</HI> Merit was a sufficient
Excuse.</P>
<P>The King consented, and <HI>Atimir</HI> and his Queen
were welcomed on their Arrival with all the De∣monstrations
of Joy possible. A little after the beau∣tiful
<HI>Hebe</HI> and her charming Spouse sent their Am∣bassadors
to the King and Queen with the News of
their Nuptials, which <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had inform'd them
of before; yet notwithstanding they were not re∣ceiv'd
with less Pleasure and Magnificence.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir</HI> was then with the King when they pre∣sented
themselves the first time before him; the
lovely Image of <HI>Hebe</HI> was not to be absolutely blot∣ted
out of an Heart over which she had so great a
Sway. <HI>Atimir</HI> could not forbear sighing when he
heard of the Happiness of the Prince of the <HI>peace∣able
Island;</HI> he accused <HI>Hebe</HI> a thousand times of be∣ing
unconstant, without thinking at the same time
on the Cause he had given her.</P>
<P>When the Ambassadors of the Prince of the <HI>peace∣able
Island</HI> return'd crown'd with Honours, and load∣ed
with Presents, they told their Princess the great
Joy the King and Queen express'd at their happy
Marriage.</P>
<P>But withal, (Oh! too sincere Relation!) they ac∣quainted
<HI>Hebe</HI> that the Princess <HI>Ileria</HI> and <HI>Atimir</HI>
were at the Court. These Names, which were so
dangerous to their Repose, render'd her again un∣easy;
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
she was then happy, but Mortals cannot long
preserve a certain Felicity.</P>
<P>She was not able to resist her Impatience to re∣turn
to her Father's Court; which was, as she said,
to see the Queen her Mother: nay, she had even
persuaded herself into a belief of it; for how often
do they who love deceive themselves in their own
Thoughts?</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Fairy's Threats to oblige
her to avoid the sight of <HI>Atimir,</HI> she proposed that
Journey to the Prince of the <HI>peaceable Island,</HI> who
at first refused her, for <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had bid him not
let her stir out of his Kingdom; but she continuing
her Intreaties, and as he adored her, and knew
nothing of her Passion for <HI>Atimir,</HI> he could not de∣ny
one he loved so well any thing.</P>
<P>He thinking to please the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> by a
blind Complaisance, gave Orders for their Depar∣ture;
and never was there seen more Magnificence
than in their Equipage and in the Ships.</P>
<P>The wise <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> provoked at the little Re∣gard
shewn by <HI>Hebe</HI> and the Prince to her Orders,
abandon'd them to their Fate, and never appear'd
to give them Advice, which they made so little
use of. For the Prince and Princess, they, after a
pleasant Voyage, arrived at the Court of <HI>Hebe's</HI> Fa∣ther;
where the King and Queen's Joy to see that
fine Princess again was very great. They were
charm'd with the Prince of the <HI>peaceable Island,</HI> and
celebrated their Arrival by great Rejoicings through∣out
the whole Kingdom; only <HI>Ileria</HI> groan'd when
she heard of <HI>Hebe's</HI> Return. And it was decreed,
that when they should see one another again, no
mention should be made of what was past.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir</HI> ask'd to see <HI>Hebe,</HI> and seem'd to <HI>Ileria</HI> to
desire it with too great an Ardour.</P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Hebe</HI> blush'd when he came into
her Chamber; they were both in a Confusion, that
all their Wit was not sufficient to extricate them
out of. The King, who was then present, obser∣ved
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
it, and joining in their Conversation, to make
this Visit the shorter, proposed walking in the Gar∣dens
of the Palace; and as <HI>Atimir</HI> durst not offer his
Hand to <HI>Hebe,</HI> he made her only a respectful Bow,
and so retired.</P>
<P>But what were the Sentiments and Idea's of his
Heart? All that lively and tender Passion he had
for <HI>Hebe,</HI> re-kindled in his Bosom; he hated <HI>Ileria</HI>
and himself, and never Infidelity was attended with
more Repentance and Grief.</P>
<P>At night he waited on the Queen, to whom <HI>Hebe</HI>
was paying a Visit; and not satisfied with looking
at her, endeavour'd to speak to her, which she al∣ways
avoided; but still his Eyes inform'd her too
much for her Quiet: He continu'd to shew by all
his Actions, that hers had again resumed their Em∣pire
over him.</P>
<P><HI>Hebe's</HI> Heart was alarm'd, <HI>Atimir</HI> always appear'd
to her too lovely; she resolved to fly him with as
much Care as he endeavour'd to find out her: she
never spoke to him but before the Queen, and then
never but when she could not absolutely dispense
with it; and was determined to persuade the
Prince her Husband to return soon to their own
Dominions: but how difficult a thing it is to leave
what we love!</P>
<P>One Evening as she was engag'd in these Thoughts,
and had shut herself up in her Closet, that she
might think more at her liberty, she found in her
Pocket a Billet, that had been put into it unknown
to her, which she open'd, and knew to be <HI>Atimir's</HI>
hand, which gave her an inexpressible Trouble; she
thought not to read it, but her Heart over-ruling
her Reason, she look'd it over, and found these
Words in it.</P>
<P><HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> Hebe,
“YOU are too insensible of my violent Passion,
and use me with too much Indifference; but
since your Heart has, in its turn, been false, and
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
has follow'd but too close the Example of mine,
let it imitate it in its Return. Forgive me, my
Princess, and permit me to resume those Chains
I once wore, when we partook of each other's
Pains and Pleasures.”</P>
<P>“Oh Cruel! <HI>cry'd the Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss;</HI> what have I done,
that you should endeavour to re-kindle in my Soul
a Tenderness, that hath caused me so much Sor∣row?”
And then her Tears interrupted her Dis∣course.”</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Ileria</HI> languish'd under a Jea∣lousy
too justly grounded, and <HI>Atimir,</HI> hurried on
by his Love, was unable to constrain himself any
longer. The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> began to
discover his Passion for <HI>Hebe,</HI> but was willing to ex∣amine
farther into <HI>Atimir's</HI> Conduct, before he spoke
of it to the Princess, whom he adored constantly,
and whom he was afraid of informing of that
Prince's Love.</P>
<P>Some days after the Receipt of this Letter, there
were appointed Courses, when all the Princes, and
sprightly Youths of the Court, were to break Lances
in honour of the Ladies.</P>
<P>The King and Queen honour'd this Diversion
with their Presence. The beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> and the
Princess <HI>Ileria</HI> were to bestow the Prizes; which
were a Sword, the Handle and Scabbard of which
were cover'd with Diamonds, and a Bracelet of
most curious Diamonds.</P>
<P>All the Knights, named for the Courses, appear'd
with an extraordinary Magnificence, mounted on
very fine Horses, bearing the Colours their Mi∣stresses
delighted in; with Devices on their Shields,
agreeable to the Sentiments of their Hearts.</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> was in a costly
Dress, mounted on a most beautiful dappled Horse,
with a fine, long, black Tail and Main: in all his
Equipage the Rose-colour appear'd, which <HI>Hebe</HI> ve∣ry
much loved; and on his Head-piece, which was
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
very light, there waved a Plume of Feathers of
the same Colour. He gain'd the Applause of all the
Spectators, and appear'd so handsome in his bright
Armour, that <HI>Hebe</HI> secretly reproach'd herself a
thousand times for the Sentiments she had the mis∣fortune
to have for another. His Train was nume∣rous,
cloth'd after the manner of their own Country,
very gallant and stately: An Esquire carried his
Shield, on which was this Device; An Heart pier∣ced
with an Arrow, and a <HI>Cupid</HI> shooting a great
number, to endeavour to make fresh Wounds; but
all, except the first, seem'd to have been drawn in
vain: these Words were underwritten;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>I fear no other.</HEAD>
<P>The Colours and Device of the Prince of the
<HI>Peaceable Island</HI> soon discover'd that he was <HI>Hebe's</HI>
Knight, and that as such he would enter the Lists.
Every body was taken up with his Magnificence,
when <HI>Atimir</HI> came forward, mounted on a black
fiery Steed, that appear'd very stately. His Colour
that day was a dark green, intermix'd neither with
Gold, Silver, or Jewels, only he had a Plume of
rose-colour'd Feathers on his Head-piece; and the
he affected a great Carelessness in his Apparel, he
had so graceful a Mien, and managed his Horse so
well, and withal had so lofty an Air, that nobody
could forbear looking at him: On his Shield, which
he carried himself, appear'd a Love, who trampled
his Chains under his feet, and bound himself with
others more weighty, with these Words:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Worthy only of Me.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Atimir's</HI> Train consisted of the principal Lords of
his Court, who were clothed in dark Green, laced
with Silver, and cover'd over with Jewels; and
tho they were all handsome and well shaped, yet
it was easy to judge by that Prince's Air, he was
born to command them.</P>
<P>The different Emotions the sight of this Prince
produced in the Hearts of <HI>Hebe</HI> and <HI>Ileria,</HI> and the
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
Jealousy the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> conceiv'd,
when he saw the Plume on <HI>Atimir's</HI> Casque of the
same Colour with his own, are not to be express'd:
The reading of the Device compleated his Rage,
the Effects of which he then stifled till a better
Opportunity.</P>
<P>The King and Queen soon took notice both of
the Boldness and Imprudence of <HI>Atimir,</HI> and were
very angry, but 'twas not then a time to shew it.
The Courses began with the Soundings of Trum∣pets,
which rended the Air with their Echoes:
they were very fine, and all the Knights shew'd
their Address; and the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI>
tho possess'd with an outrageous Jealousy, signaliz'd
himself, and was proclaim'd Conqueror.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir,</HI> who knew that the first Prize was to be
given by <HI>Ileria,</HI> never disputed the Victory with the
Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island:</HI> He was declared Vic∣tor
by the Judges of the Field; and advanced grace∣fully,
with the Acclamations and Praises of all the
Spectators, to the Place where the King and Prin∣cesses
sat to receive the Bracelet; which the Prin∣cess
<HI>Ileria</HI> presented to him, and he took with a
good Grace: then paying his Respects to the King,
Queen, and Princess, he return'd to the Lists.</P>
<P>The melancholy <HI>Ileria</HI> observing but too well the
Disdain the light <HI>Atimir</HI> shew'd for the Prize she
was to give, sigh'd grievously; and the beautiful
<HI>Hebe</HI> felt in her Breast a secret Joy, which all her
Reason could not resist.</P>
<P>The second Course began with the same Success as
the first, wherein the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI>
animated by the sight of <HI>Hebe,</HI> did Wonders, and was
declar'd Victor again; when <HI>Atim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> vex'd to be a
Spectator of his Rival's Glory, and flatter'd with the
Thought of receiving the Prize from <HI>Hebe's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and,
went and presented himself at the end of the Lists.</P>
<P>The two Rivals look'd on each other scornfully,
and that Course between two so great Princes was
celebrated by the new Trouble it caused the two
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
Princesses. The Princes ran one against the other
with equal advantage, and broke their Lances
without any disorder. The Shouts of the Specta∣tors
redoubled, and they, without giving their
Horses time to breathe, return'd to take fresh Lan∣ces,
and ran with the same Success and Address as
at first. The King, who fear'd lest Fortune should
declare one of them Victors, sent presently to tell
them, that they ought to be satisfied with the Glory
they had gain'd, and to desire them to put an end
to the Courses.</P>
<P>When the Person the King sent came to them,
they heard him with a great deal of Impatience,
especially <HI>Atimir;</HI> who taking upon him to speak,
said. “Go tell the King, I should be unworthy of
the Honour he does me, in concerning himself
with my Glory, if I should suffer a Conqueror.”
“Let us see then, <HI>said the Prince of the</HI> Peaceable
Island, <HI>spurring on his Horse with great Ardour,</HI> which
merits most the King's Esteem, and the Favours
of Fortune.”</P>
<P>The Messenger was not return'd to the King,
before the two Rivals, urged on by Sentiments
more prevalent than the Prize, began their Course;
wherein Fortune favour'd the audacious <HI>Atimir,</HI> and
pronounced him Victor, the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable
Island's</HI> Horse, wearied with the Courses he had
made, falling down, and throwing his Master on
the Sand: How great was <HI>Atimir's</HI> Joy, and that un∣fortunate
Prince's Rage! He got up quickly, and
going up to his Rival before any came to them;
“You have overcome me in Sports, <HI>Atimir, said he,
with an A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r sufficient to shew his Passion:</HI> But with
my Sword I will decide our Differences.” “I con∣sent,
<HI>reply'd the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> Atimir, and will meet you to-morrow
at Sun-rise, in the Wood at the end of
the Palace-Gardens.” As they had made an end
of these Words, the Judges of the Field came up to
them; whereupon they disguised their mutual
Rage, lest the King should prevent their Designs.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="164"/>
The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> mounted his
Horse again, and rid with all speed to leave the
fatal Place, where <HI>Atimir</HI> had vanquish'd him: In
the mean time that Prince went to receive the Prize
of the Course from <HI>Hebe,</HI> who presented it to him
with a Confusion that discover'd the different Com∣motions
of her Soul; and <HI>Atimir,</HI> in taking it, commit∣ted
all the Extravagancies of a Man very much in love.</P>
<P>The King and Queen, who had their Eyes fixed
on them, observed him all the time, and return'd
to their Palace, very much dissatisfied with the
ending of that Day. <HI>Atimir,</HI> possess'd with his Pas∣sion,
went out of the Lists without any Attendants;
and <HI>Ileria,</HI> outrageous with Grief and Jealousy, went
back to her Apartments.</P>
<P>Various then were the Thoughts of <HI>Hebe;</HI> “I must
go hence, <HI>said she to herself,</HI> since no other Reme∣dy
can be found to prevent the Misfortunes that I
foresee.”</P>
<P>At the same time, the King and Queen resolved
to desire <HI>Atimir</HI> to go home, to avoid the new Trou∣bles
his Love might create; which same Proposi∣tion
they likewise determined to make to the Prince
of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI> that neither Party might take
any Umbrage thereat. But the Prince's hasty Reso∣lutions
prevented this prudent Foresight, for while
they deliberated on their Departure, the others
prepared for the Combat.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Hebe</HI> came back from the Courses, she
ask'd for the Prince her Spouse, whom they told
her was in the Gardens of the Palace very melan∣choly,
and willing to be alone. The beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI>
thought it her Duty to go and comfort him after
his Ill-fortune; so without staying in her Apart∣ment,
she went into the Gardens, follow'd by some
of her Women.</P>
<P>She was looking for the Prince, when entring
into a shady Walk, she espy'd the amorous <HI>Atimir,</HI>
who, transported with his Passion, and regarding
nothing else, fell on his Knees some distance from
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
the Princess, and drawing the Sword he that day
received from her; “Hear me, charming <HI>Hebe,
said he,</HI> or let me die at your feet.”</P>
<P>The Women, frighted at this Action of the
Prince, threw themselves upon him, endeavour∣ing
to take away his Sword, which he turn'd with
great Rage on the other side. <HI>Hebe,</HI> the unhappy
<HI>Hebe,</HI> was for flying; but how great must our Rea∣son
be, that can force us from what we love!</P>
<P>The Desire of keeping this Adventure secret, with
her Design to intreat <HI>Atimir</HI> to strive to cure a Pas∣sion
so fatal to them both, and the Compassion so
moving an Object created, all contributed to stay
the Princess, who made up to the Prince; her Pre∣sence
suspended his Fury, his Sword he let fall at
her feet, and never more Trouble, Love, and Grief
appear'd at once in so short a Conversation.</P>
<P>Words are not tender enough to express what
those two unhappy Lovers then endured: <HI>Hebe,</HI> un∣easy
to see herself with <HI>Atimir,</HI> and so nigh the
Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI> made a great Effort
on herself to leave him, charging him never to see
her more. How cruel was this Command! Had
not <HI>Atimir</HI> call'd to mind the Engagement he lay
under to fight the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Isle,</HI> he
had a thousand times turn'd the Sword upon him∣self;
but alas! he chose rather to die, revenging
himself on his Rival.</P>
<P>The fair <HI>Hebe</HI> retired instantly to her Apartment,
the more securely to avoid the Presence of <HI>Atimir:</HI>
“Merciless Fairy, <HI>cry'd she;</HI> you only told me of
Death, if I ever saw this unhappy Prince, but
now I feel Torments a thousand times more griev∣ous!”
Then she sending to seek for the Prince
in the Gardens and the Palace, and not finding
him, her Uneasiness increased; they sought him all
the night to no purpose, for he had hid himself in
a Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the midst of the Wood, that he might not
be prevented from meeting at the Place appoint∣ed,
which he repair'd to at Sun-rise, where <HI>Atimir</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="166"/>
arriv'd soon after. These two Rivals, impatient to
revenge themselves, and to gain the Victory, drew
their Swords; which was the first time the Prince
of the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> ever made use of his, since
there was never any War in his Dominions.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, he appear'd not the less formidable
Enemy to <HI>Atimir,</HI> for tho he had but little Expe∣rience,
he had Courage, was in love, and fought
like a Man that despised Death; while <HI>Atimir</HI> main∣tain'd
the great Reputation he had so worthily gain'd.</P>
<P>These two Princes were animated by Passions
too much different, not to render the End of this
Duel fatal; for after they had a long time main∣tain'd
an equal Advantage, they made two such
furious Thrusts at each other, that both fell on the
Grass, which they dyed with their Blood.</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Isle</HI> fainted away in∣stantly
with the loss of his; and <HI>Atimir,</HI> mortally
wounded, pronounced the Name of <HI>Hebe</HI> as he expir'd.</P>
<P>Some of those Persons, who were sent to look
for the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI> arriv'd at that
fatal Place, and were seiz'd with Horrour at so dis∣mal
a sight.</P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Hebe,</HI> drawn by her Disquiet, was
going into the Gardens, when hearing the Shrieks
of People, who pronounced confusedly the Names
of the two Princes, she hereupon ran and found
those so sad and dismal Objects; she thought that
the Prince her Husband was dead as well as <HI>Atimir,</HI>
who at that time were both alike to her: when af∣ter
having look'd some time on those unhappy Prin∣ces,
she cry'd out dolefully, “Ye precious Lives,
which were sacrificed for me, I will revenge you
by the loss of my own.” And after these Words
fell on the fatal Sword <HI>Atimir</HI> receiv'd from her, and
had pierced her Breast before the People (who were
amazed at this cruel Adventure) could hinder her.</P>
<P>Just as she expired, the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta</HI> appear'd,
who, touch'd with so many Misfortunes, which she
had opposed with all her power, accused Fate, and
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
could not forbear shedding of Tears. Then think∣ing
of assisting the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable Island,</HI>
whom she knew was not dead, she cured him of
his Wounds, and transported him instantly into his
own <HI>Isle;</HI> where, by the wonderful Gift she had be∣stow'd
on it, that Prince was consolated for the
Loss he had sustain'd, and forgot his Passion for
<HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>The King and Queen, who had not the like As∣sistance,
gave themselves up entirely to their Grief,
which was only to be worn off by Time: and as
for <HI>Ileria,</HI> her Despair cannot be express'd; who was
always both faithful to her Grief, and the ungrate∣ful
<HI>Atimir.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had transported the Prince of
the <HI>Peaceable Island</HI> into his own Dominions, she
touch'd with her Wand the unfortunate Remains of
the lovely <HI>Atimir</HI> and beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> who in an in∣stant
were changed into two Trees of an admira∣ble
Beauty, which the Fairy named <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms,</HI> to pre∣serve
for ever the Remembrance of those, which
shone so bright in these unhappy Lovers.</P>

<HEAD>The Story of Don FERDINAND
of Toledo.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Count <HI>de Fuentes,</HI> who was a Gentle∣man
that lived for the most part at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
had the misfortune to have a very trou∣blesome
Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; who, when he was young,
tormented him with Jealousies, and when he was
in years, persecuted his Children. She had two
Daughters and a Nephew; the elder, who was cal∣led
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
<HI>Leonora,</HI> was fair and witty, her Shape both easy
and noble, her Features all regular, and her Wit
seem'd so agreeable and judicious, that she gain'd
both the Esteem and Friendship of all that knew
her. <HI>Matilda,</HI> the younger, had black Hair, a live∣ly
Complexion, sparkling Eyes, delicate Teeth, an
Air of Gayety, and so pleasing a Behaviour, that
she was no less engaging than her Sister. And for
Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> their Cousin, he was valued and e∣steem'd
by all as a Man of Worth.</P>
<P>Two Gentlemen, who were their Relations,
whose Names were, Don <HI>James de Casareal,</HI> and Don
<HI>Ferdinand de Toledo,</HI> lived so nigh to the Count <HI>de
Fuentes,</HI> that they had contracted a great Friendship
with Don <HI>Francis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o;</HI> and by often coming to visit
him, seen his Cousins, and were grown sensible
of their Charms: but their Mother's Vigilance was
so great, as to disturb these Dispositions, by threat∣ning
to put them into Religious Houses, if ever
they spoke to Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand;</HI> and to
these Menaces added two Duegna's, more watchful
than <HI>Arg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s:</HI> which new Obstacles only augmented
these two Gentlemens Passion. The Mother disco∣ver'd
every day some new piece of Gallantry of
theirs, which put her into a great Rage; and know∣ing
that her Nephew gave his Friends a thousand
Opportunities to see his Cousins, either in their
Balconies, or by walking with them in the Gar∣dens,
she was quite tired with continually chiding
them: therefore, to frustrate all their Designs, one
day, when the Count her Husband was gone to
Court, she took her Daughters with her in a Coach,
and drove away for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> hard by which Place
the Count had a very considerable Estate; leaving
a Letter behind her, wherein she desired him to
come to her, and bring her Nephew along with
him. But the Count <HI>de Fue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes,</HI> who was wearied
out with his Wife's odd Humours, instead of follow∣ing
her, bless'd his Stars that he had got rid of her,
and pitied his Daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="169"/>
When Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> were inform∣ed
by Don <HI>Francisco</HI> of their Mistresses Departure,
they were extremely grieved, and thought of all
ways possible to induce them to come to <HI>Madrid</HI>
again; but upon Don <HI>Francisco's</HI> telling them, that
their Endeavours that way would only prevent
them, they resolved to go for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> hoping that
they might find there some favourable Opportunity
of Discourse with them, and desired Don <HI>Francisco,</HI>
who could not refuse, to go along with them. The
old Countess was overjoy'd to see him; it was some
time before she knew that Don <HI>James</HI> and Don
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> were there, who saw her Daughters eve∣ry
night thro a grated Window, that look'd into a
little Street; where, instead of complaining of their
Fate, they swore an eternal Fidelity to each other,
and comforted themselves with flattering Hopes.
But the Duegnas understood their business too well,
to be long deceiv'd by these Lovers; in short, they
surprized them at the Window, and notwithstand∣ing
their Prayers and Intreaties, went and told the
Countess.</P>
<P>The Mother was so enraged at this News, that
she arose, tho it was not Day, had her Coach got
ready, and convey'd her Daughters to a Castle about
a day's Journey from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> scolding them all the
way; and we may easily imagine that so sudden a
Departure put our Lovers into the utmost Disorder.
One sigh'd, and the other complain'd, and when∣ever
Don <HI>Francisco</HI> went to the <HI>Aspegnas,</HI> which was
the Name of the Castle, they sent Letters and Pre∣sents
by him, which he forced his Cousins to ac∣cept,
because he knew their sincere Intentions to
marry them; and whenever he return'd from the
<HI>Aspegnas,</HI> Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> press'd him
to go again, and conjur'd him to find out some
way or other to take them along with him; but
that was an Affair so nice, that Don <HI>Francisco</HI> seem'd
to hesitate at it, thinking it was enough that he
could procure them the means of writing to them.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170"/>
Don <HI>Francisco</HI> having stay'd some few days with
his Aunt, just when he was going away, the
Countess told him, she heard that the <HI>Morocco</HI> Am∣bassador
was arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and that if any thing
would invite her to go there, it would be her
Desire to see him. Whereupon, Don <HI>Francisco</HI> taking
this Opportunity to be serviceable to his Friends,
by procuring them an Interview with his Cousins,
answered, That he was particularly well acquaint∣ed
with the Ambassador's two Sons, who were Men
of Wit and Politeness; and that, if she would
promise to receive them with all the Ceremonies
of their Country, he would endeavour to bring
them to see her: And knowing that his Aunt was
very nice upon the Point of Gentility, and that
her Closet was hung round-with Escutcheons and
Atchievements, he told her, That as soon as the
Ambassador's Sons were inform'd of her Quality,
they would be impatient till they had paid their
Respects to her; and withal added, That they
might tell of the Greatness of her Birth in their
Country, and that this Visit might be an Imbe∣lishment
to her Genealogy.</P>
<P>The Countess, who had as much Vanity as
Curiosity, thinking that this would make a great
noise in the whole Country, seem'd overjoy'd at
this Proposition of her Nephew's, and told him
she was very much obliged to him, bidding him
neglect nothing to procure her the Pleasure of
a Visit from those polite <HI>Mahometants.</HI></P>
<P>Don <HI>James</HI> and his Cousin went to meet Don
<HI>Francisco,</HI> so eager were they to hear News from
their Mistresses; and after having read their Let∣ters,
thank'd Don <HI>Francisco</HI> for all his good Offices,
who told them all that had pass'd between him
and his Aunt, advised them to provide Habits, and
practise their parts, assuring them that he would
act his to the best advantage. The two Lovers
seem'd charm'd with Don <HI>Francisco's</HI> Thought, and
prais'd both his Wit and Address. They went
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
about their clothing with all dispatch, ordered
some rich Vests of Cloth of Gold to be made, and
Cymitars set with Jewels, Turbants, and whatever
was necessary for this Masquerade; and, by good
fortune, they met with a Painter who had an Oil
that made the Skin as brown as they wanted to have
it: and when all things were ready, Don <HI>Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sco</HI>
sent one of his Servants to the Countess, to let
her know the day that he design'd to bring the
Ambassador's Sons. The Countess was in a great
hurry to put every thing in order, to receive these
illustrious <HI>Moors;</HI> she ordered her Daughters to
neglect nothing to make them appear lovely in
their Eyes: and her Severity which extended over
all other Nations, was laid aside in regard to
that of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rocco;</HI> because she being a great De∣voree,
look'd upon them as <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbarians</HI> and Enemies
to the Faith; therefore she thought it impossible
for a <HI>Spanish Woman</HI> ever to love a Man that had
nto been baptized, and so fancy'd she ran no risque
by exposing her Daughters to the sight of those
gallant <HI>Africans.</HI></P>
<P>As it was Evening when they arrived, the
Castle was full of Lights. The Countess receiv'd
them upon the Stairs, and they saluting her, made
such extraordinary low Bows, lifted up their
Hands so often, and made so many Hah's and
Hoh's, that Don <HI>Francis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> who constrain'd himself as
much as possible, could not forbear laughing. The
Countess, in her turn, paid her Compliments, but
could not forbear crossing herself as often as they
pronounced <HI>Hala!</HI> And it was not without great
Acknowledgements, that she receiv'd Pieces of
Brocade, Fans, China, carved Stones of curious
Workmanship, and other Rarities they brought
with them for her and her Daughters, which they
said were common things in their Country; speak∣ing
all the time such broken <HI>Spanish,</HI> that they
could hardly understand them. The good Coun∣tess
was transported with all these Honours; but
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
while they entertain'd her with all the Distraction
that Love causes when the Object is before the
Eyes, whatever Guard they had upon themselves,
they could not help looking upon their Mistresses,
and fixing their Eyes upon them. Donna <HI>Leonora</HI>
felt a secret Uneasiness that flattered her Heart,
the Reason of which she could not discover; and tho
she knew Don <HI>Ferd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nand's</HI> Eyes, and discovered
some of Don <HI>James's</HI> Features in one of the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI>
she knew them not in that brown Complexion, and
in those Habits.</P>
<P>The Countess carried them into a large Gallery
hung with Pictures, and shew'd them one she had
lately bought, which was a Piece of <HI>Cupids</HI> at
play, wherein one, to frighten the rest, had put on
a Mask. Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> commended the Painter's
Fancy, and the Excellence of the Work, in
terms that shewed both his Wit and Judgment;
and staying loitering behind, while the Countess
was talking with her Nephew, writ with his
Pencil these Words under the mask'd <HI>Cupid,</HI>
<Q><L>Es condid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a todos</L>
<L>Por servisto de tus lindos ojos.</L>
<L>I hide myself from all the World, to see your fair Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>No sooner had <HI>Leonora</HI> read them, but she unfold∣ed
the Riddle, and conceiv'd a Trouble intermixed
with Joy. Don <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdinand</HI> found that she had dis∣covered
the Mystery, and was glad of it; he ap∣pear'd
more gay and li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely, and in all their Con∣versation
said a thousand pretty things, wherein
<HI>Leonora</HI> had part: who, whatever pleasure she might
take in hearing them, could not forbear taking
her Sister aside, and communicating her Thoughts
to her. “Ah! my dear <HI>Matilda, said she,</HI> are
not you afraid as well as me, lest Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
and Don <HI>James</HI> should be known?” “What do you
mean, <HI>replied</HI> Matilda, I don't understand you?”
“Alas! <HI>continued</HI> Leonora, your Eyes are but bad
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
Servants to your Heart: What have you not
observed that that <HI>Moor,</HI> who has never left you, is
Don <HI>James,</HI> and he who talk'd to me, Don <HI>Ferdi∣nand?</HI>”
“Is it possible, <HI>cried</HI> Matilda, that what
you tell me should be true?—But, <HI>continued
she,</HI> his Looks and every Action leave me no room
to doubt of it.” Just as they rejoin'd their Cou∣sin
and Lovers, they heard the Countess propose
taking a walk in the Garden, which was lighted
with Lamps down to a Wood, which was at the
bottom of the Garden, which was a glorious Sight.
The Company passed through a large Walk, on
ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h side of which was a Canal, to a Bower of
Jessamins, Oranges, and Honeysuckles; in the
midst of which was a Fountain playing, which by
its gentle Murmurs, excited the Nightingales to
join in Concerts, which made it a sweet abode.
They placed themselves on fine enamell'd Banks,
in form of Benches, and were regaled with Jellies,
Chocolate, and all manner of fine Sweet-meats,
till Supper was ready; and as the Countess studied
to please and divert the <HI>Moors,</HI> and as Stories were
very much in fashion, she bid <HI>Leonora</HI> tell one:
which Command, that beautiful Lady not daring
to refuse, she began as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Story of the Yellow Dwarf.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a Queen, who, tho she had ma∣ny
Children, could get but one to live, which
was a beautiful Daughter; and being left a Widow,
and without hopes of having any more, was so much
afraid of losing her, that she never gave her any
Correction for what Faults she committed: inso∣much
that that admirable Person, who knew her
own Beauty, and that she was born to a Crown,
was so vain and proud of her growing Charms, that
<PB N="165" REF="174"/>
she despised all the World besides. The Queen
her Mother contributed, by her Caresses and Com∣plaisance,
to persuade her none were deserving of
her; she was dress'd every day either like a <HI>Pallas</HI>
or <HI>Diana,</HI> follow'd by her Nymphs: and in short,
the Queen, to give the finishing Stroke to her Va∣nity,
call'd her <HI>All-Fair;</HI> and having had her Pi∣cture
drawn by the best Painters, sent it to all the
Kings with whom she was in Alliance, who, when
they saw it, were not able to resist the inevitable
power of her Charms; some fell sick, others run
mad, and those who escap'd either Sickness or Mad∣ness,
came to her Court, and as soon as they saw
her became her Slaves.</P>
<P>Never was any Court more gallant and po∣lite;
twenty Kings studied to please her, who, after
they had spent immense Sums upon an Entertain∣ment
upon her, thought themselves fully recom∣pens'd
if she said any thing was pretty in them.
The Adorations that were paid her over-joy'd the
Queen her Mother; not a day pass'd over her head
but she had thousands of Songs and fine Copies of
Verses sent by all the most famous Poets in the
World. In short, <HI>All-Fair</HI> was the only Subject of the
most renown'd Authors, both in Prose and Verse.
The Princess was about fifteen; there were none
who did not desire to marry her, but they durst not
pretend to that Honour, it was so difficult a Task
to touch an Heart of that stamp. Her Lovers mur∣mur'd
very much against her Cruelty, and the
Queen, who wanted to have her married, knew
not how to gain her Consent; sometimes she would
say to her, “Will you not abate somewhat of that
intolerable Pride, that makes you contemn all the
Kings that come to our Court? I will chuse one
for you, shew me in this some Complacency.” “I
am already happy, <HI>reply'd</HI> All-Fair, in the easy In∣difference
I now live in; if I should once lose
that, you would perhaps be angry.” “I should be
angry if you loved any one beneath you, <HI>answer'd
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
the Queen;</HI> but you cannot have more deserving
Princes than those that now ask you.” In short,
the Princess was so prepossess'd of her own Merit,
that she thought it greater than what it was; and
by this Resolution of hers to live a Maid, began to
grieve her Mother so much, that she repented, but
too late, that she had humour'd her so much.</P>
<P>The Queen, uncertain what to do, goes all alone
to find a celebrated Fairy, that was call'd the <HI>De∣sart
Fairy;</HI> but as it was an hard thing to see her,
because she was guarded by two Lions, unless she
made a Cake for them of Millet, Sugarcandy, and
Crocodiles Eggs, she prepared one herself, and
put it into a little Basket, which she hung upon her
Arm: but being wearied with walking farther than
she was used to, she laid herself down under the
shade of a Tree to rest herself, and there insensibly
fell asleep, and when she awaked found only her
Basket, and her Cake gone; and, to compleat her
Misfortune, heard the Lions coming. “Alas! <HI>cry'd
she,</HI> what will become of me? I shall be devour'd.”
And having no power to stir, she lean'd against the
Tree she had slept under▪ when hearing somebody
say. <HI>Hem, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m!</HI> she look'd about on all sides, and
raising her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes, perceiv'd a little Man in the Tree,
about half a Yard in height, eating Oranges, who
said to her, “O Queen, I know you, and the fear
you are in l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st these Lions should de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our you; I
cannot blame you, they have de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our'd a great ma∣ny,
and, to your misfortune, you want a Cake.”
“I must resolve on Death. <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ply'd the Queen sighing;</HI>
but alas! I should not be so much griev'd was my
dear Girl but married!” “What! Have you a Daugh∣ter?
<HI>said the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, who was called so from his
Complexion and the Ora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e-tree he liv'd in:</HI> Indeed I
am very glad of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, for I have sought after a
Wife both by Sea and Land; now if you will pro∣mise
me I shall have her, I will secure you both
from Lions. Tyger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Bears.” The Queen look'd
at him, as much frighten'd at his horrible little Fi∣gure
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
as at the Lions, and musing some time, re∣turn'd
no Answer. “What, do you hesitate, Madam?
“<HI>cry'd he,</HI> it seems you are not very fond of Life.”
At the same time the Lions appear'd on the top of
a small Hill, running towards her; at which sight
the Queen, who trembled like a Dove when she
sees a Kite, cry'd out with all her might, “Good
Sir Dwarf, <HI>All-Fair</HI> is yours.” “Oh! <HI>said he with an
Air of Disdain, All-Fair</HI> is too fair, I will not have
her.” “O Sir, <HI>continu'd the afflicted Queen,</HI> don't re∣fuse
her, she is the most charming Princess in the
World.” “Well, <HI>said he,</HI> I will take her out of
Charity; but remember the Gift you make me.”
And thereupon the Orange-tree open'd, and the
Queen was let into it, and so escaped from the Li∣ons.
She was vex'd she could find no Door to that
Tree, when at last she perceiv'd one that open'd
into a Field full of Nettles and Thistles, surrounded
with a muddy Ditch; in the middle thereof stood a
little thatch'd House, out of which the yellow
Dwarf came in a pleasant Air, wooden Shoes, a
coarse yellow Stuff Jacket, and without any Hair
to hide his large Ears. “I am glad, good Mother-in-law,
<HI>said he to the Queen,</HI> to see you in this my
Abode, where your Daughter is to live with me;
she may keep an Ass to ride out on with these
Nettles and Thistles, and may secure herself from
the Injuries of the Weather under this rustick
Roof; she will have this Water to drink, and
may eat some of these Frogs that are fatten'd in
it: besides, I shall always bear her Company, and
never shall leave her.”</P>
<P>When the unfortunate Queen came to consider
on the deplorable Life this Dwarf promised her
dear Child, she was not able to support the terrible
Idea, but fell into a Swoon, and had not the power
to say one word; and while she was in that Con∣dition,
was convey'd to her own Bed, in a fine Suit
of Night-clothes of the newest Fashion. As soon
as the Queen came to herself, she remembered what
<PB N="168" REF="177"/>
had happen'd, but knew not how to believe it,
seeing she was in her own Palace, in the midst of
all the Ladies of her Court, and her Daughter by
her Bed-side: but the fine Night-clothes, which
were of a curious Lace, amaz'd her as much as the
Dream she fancy'd she had had; and thro the Ex∣cess
of her Disquiet she fell into such an extraordi∣nary
Fit of Melancholy, that she hardly either spoke,
eat, or slept. The Princess, who lov'd her at her
heart, was very much griev'd, and often ask'd her
what was the matter; when the Queen, to deceive
her, told her sometimes it proceeded from her ill
State of Health, and other times from some of the
neighbouring Princes Threatnings to make War
against her. Tho <HI>All-Fair</HI> found these Answers very
plausible, however she knew there was something
more in the bottom, which the Queen endeavour'd
to hide from her; and being no longer able to en∣dure
her Uneasiness, resolved to go to the Desart-Fairy,
to ask her Advice whether or no she should
marry, since she was so much press'd to it: she
took care to make a Cake to appease the Lions, and
pretending to go to bed earlier than ordinary, went
down a pair of back Stairs in a white Veil that
reach'd to her Feet, to set forward on her Jour∣ney.</P>
<P>When the Princess came to the fatal Orange-tree,
she saw it so loaded with Fruit, that she had a great
mind to gather some; whereupon, she set down
her Basket, and pluck'd some and eat them; but when
she went to look for her Basket and Cake, and
found them taken away, her Grief was inexpressi∣ble,
and turning about, espy'd the little frightful
Dwarf, who said to her, “What makes you cry,
Child?” “Alas! who can forbear? <HI>replied she,</HI> I
have lost my Basket and Cake, which were so
necessary in my Journey to the Desart-Fairy's.
What want you with her? <HI>answered this little Mon∣key,</HI>
I am her Relation and Friend, and am as
knowing to the full.” “The Queen my Mother,
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
<HI>replied the Princess,</HI> is grown very melancholy,
which makes me fear for her Life; I fancy I may
be the cause of it, since she has desired me to
marry, and I must own to you, I have not yet
found any one that I think deserving enough of
me: These are the Reasons that have engaged
me to speak with the Fairy.” “Princess, give
yourself no further trouble, <HI>said the Dwarf,</HI> I am
more proper to inform you about these things:
The Queen your Mother is vex'd, that she has
promised you in Marriage.” “The Queen pro∣mised
me in Marriage! <HI>said she, interrupting him;</HI>
undoubtedly you are mistaken, she would cer∣tainly
have told me of it: I am too much con∣cern'd
in that Affair, to be engaged without my
own Consent.” “Beautiful Princess, <HI>said the Dwarf,
throwing himself at her feet;</HI> I flatter myself this
Choice will not be displeasing to you, when I tell
you I am destin'd to that Happiness.” “My Mo∣ther
chose you for a Son-in-Law! <HI>cry'd</HI> All-Fair,
<HI>falling back some Steps;</HI> was ever any Folly like
yours?” “I am not very fond of the Honour, <HI>said
he, in a Passion;</HI> but here are the Lions, who will
revenge my Affront.”</P>
<P>At the same time the Princess heard the Lions
roaring: “What will become of me! <HI>said she;</HI> must
I thus end my Days!” The wicked Dwarf look'd
at her, and with a malicious Smile said, “You shall
have the Glory of dying, and not bestowing your
shining Merit on a poor miserable Dwarf, such
as I am.” “Pray be not angry, <HI>said the Princess,
lifting up her hands;</HI> I'd rather marry all the Dwarfs
in the World, than die after so frightful a man∣ner.”
“Observe me well, Princess, <HI>said he,</HI> before
you give me your Word, for I do not pretend to
surprize you.” “I have already, <HI>reply'd she;</HI> but
the Lions approach towards me, save me, or I
shall die with fear.” In short, she fell into a
Swoon, and without knowing how she got there,
found herself in her own Bed, in the finest Linen
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
and Ribbons possible, with a Ring of one single
red Hair so fast upon her Finger, that she could
not get it off.</P>
<P>When the Princess saw all this, and remembred
what had pass'd before, she grew so melancholy,
that all the Court were surprized and uneasy at it;
the Queen was most alarm'd of all, and ask'd a
thousand times what was the matter, but she was
determin'd in herself to conceal her Adventure
from her. At last the States of the Kingdom, im∣patient
to have their Princess married, assembled,
and address'd the Queen to make choice of an
Husband for her out of hand; the Queen told
them, it was what she had most at heart, but that
her Daughter was very much against it: however,
she advised them to go to her, and talk with her
about it, which they did immediately. <HI>All-Fair,</HI>
whose Pride was somewhat abated, since her Adven∣ture
with the Yellow Dwarf, thought it would be the
best way to marry some potent Prince, with whom
that little Ape would not dare to dispute so glo∣rious
a Conquest; and gave them a favourable An∣swer,
and consented to marry the King of the Gol∣den
Mines, who was a powerful and handsome
Prince, who loved her with a violent Passion, and
who never till then durst entertain any hopes. We
may easily guess at the Excess of his Joy, and his
Rival's Rage, when the News was declared. There
were great Preparations made against the Nuptials,
and the King of the Gold Mines launch'd out such
prodigious Sums of Money, that the Sea was full
of Ships, that were sent to the remotest Parts for
the greatest Rarities. In short, that Prince disco∣ver'd
such lively and delicate Sentiments, that she
began to have some Passion for him. Thus were
they both happy, when one day the King, who
was both gallant and in love, took the liberty to
discover his Tenderness to her in the Garden, in
Verses of his own making; among which, he re∣peated
these Lines:
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
<Q><L>The verdant Leaves but out when you appear,</L>
<L>And all the Trees their brightest Liverys wear;</L>
<L>The Flow'rs spring forth by your indulgent Heat,</L>
<L>And am'rous Birds their little Songs repeat:</L>
<L>In this blest Place, distant from Care and Crowns,</L>
<L>All Nature smiles, and you her Goddess owns.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the midst of all this Joy, the King's Rivals,
who were in the utmost despair at his Good-for∣tune,
and sensible of the most piercing Grief, left
the Court, and return'd to their own Dominions,
not being able to be Eye-witnesses to the Princess's
Marriage; but before they went, they took their
leaves of her in so obliging a manner, that she
could not but pity them. “O! Madam, <HI>said the
King of the Gold Mines,</HI> what do you rob me of, by
granting your Pity to Lovers, who are over and
above recompenced for their pains by one single
Look from you!” “I should be angry, <HI>reply'd he
Princess,</HI> if you was insensible of the Compassion
I have shewn those Princes, to whom I am lost
for ever; it is a Proof of your Delicacy, which
I approve of: But, Sir, their Conditions are far
different from yours; you ought to be pleased
with what I have done for you, they have no
reason to be so, therefore you should restrain your
Jealousy.” The King of the Golden Mines was
so confounded at the obliging manner that the Prin∣cess
took a thing that might very well have dis∣pleased
her, that he threw himself at her feet, kiss'd
her hand, and ask'd a thousand pardons.</P>
<P>At last the long-wish'd-for Day came, and the
Nuptials were proclaim'd, by sounding of Trum∣pets,
and all other Ceremonies; the Balconies were
all adorn'd with Tapestries, and the Houses bedeck'd
with Flowers. The Queen was so overjoy'd, that
she was hardly in bed, and got to sleep, but she
rose again to give the necessary Orders, and to
chuse out the Jewels the Princess was to wear that
<PB N="172" REF="181"/>
day. She was cover'd almost over with Diamonds,
and on her Gown, which was a silver Brocade,
were twelve Suns form'd with Diamonds. But no∣thing
appear'd so bright as that Princess's natural
Charms; a rich Crown was set upon her Head, her
Hair hung down almost to her feet, and the Maje∣sty
of her Shape distinguish'd her from all the Ladies
that attended on her. The King of the Gold Mines
shew'd himself no less accomplish'd and magnificent;
Joy and Chearfulness appear'd in all his Actions:
none approach'd him, but he loaded them with his
Gifts and Presents; for he had order'd some thou∣sands
of Tons of Gold, and velvet Sacks, imbroi∣der'd
with Pearls, full of Guineas, to be placed in
the Hall, where all that put forth their Hands, re∣ceived
Handfuls of Gold; insomuch that this part
of the Ceremony drew there great Crouds of Peo∣ple,
that would have been insensible of all the o∣ther
Pleasures.</P>
<P>As the Queen, King, and Princess, were going
out into a long Gallery, they saw a Box move to∣wards
them, in which there sat a large old Wo∣man,
at whose Age and Decrepidness they were not
so much surprized, as at her Ugliness: she lean'd
upon a Crutch, had a black taffety Ruff on, a red
velvet Hood, and a Fardingale all in Rags; and af∣ter
having taken two or three Turns about, with∣out
speaking a word, she stopt in the middle of the
Gallery, and shaking her Crutch in a threatning
manner, cry'd out, “Ho, ho! you Queen and Prin∣cess,
do you think to falsify, unpunish'd, your
Words, which you gave my Friend the Yellow
Dwarf; I am the Desart-Fairy, and don't you
know, that if it had not been for him and his O∣range-tree,
you had been devour'd by my Lions.
These Insults to Fairys shall not be allow'd; think
presently on what you design, for I swear by my
Coif, you shall marry him, or I will burn my
Crutch.” “Ah! Princess, <HI>said the Queen in Tears,</HI>
what is this that I hear? what have you pro∣mised?”
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
“Ah! Mother, <HI>reply'd the Princess, full of
Grief,</HI> what have you promised?” The King of
the Gold Mines, enraged at what had pass'd, and
that this wicked old Woman should come to op∣pose
his Happiness, drew his Sword, and going up
towards her, pointed it to her Throat, “Wretch,
<HI>said he,</HI> be gone from hence, or I'll revenge thy
Malice on thy Life.” He had no sooner pronoun∣ced
these words, but the upper part of the Box
flew off with great noise, and out came the Yellow
Dwarf, mounted on a large <HI>Spanish</HI> Cat, and placed
himself between the Desart-Fairy and the King of
the Gold Mines: “Rash Youth, <HI>said he,</HI> think not
to commit this Violence on the illustrious Fairy,
thy Rage should light on me; I am thy Rival and
thy Enemy: the false Princess, who was going to
bestow herself on thee, has given me her Word,
and receiv'd mine; see if she has not a Ring of
my Hair upon her Finger, by that you may judge
of my Right to her.” “Hideous Monster, <HI>said the
King,</HI> hast thou the Boldness to call thyself the
Adorer of this Divine Princess, and to pretend to
so glorious a Possession? Thou art such a Ba∣boon,
such an odious Figure, that I had sacrificed
thee before now, hadst thou been worthy of so
honourable a Death.” The Dwarf piqued to the
very Soul at those words, clap'd his Spurs in the
Cat's Sides, which made such a mewing, and fly∣ing
about, as frighten'd all but the King; who hem∣med
in the Dwarf so close, that he drew a large Cut∣lash,
with which he was arm'd, and defying the
King to a Combat, went down into the Court of
the Palace, making a terrible noise. The enraged
King follow'd him as fast as possible; and when
they stood opposite to each other, ready to begin
the Combat, the Sun on a sudden turn'd as red as
Blood, and it grew as dark as pitch; it thunder'd
and lighten'd, and by the Flashes of the Lightning
the King and all the Court, who were got into the
Balconies, perceiv'd two Giants vomiting Fire on
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
each side of the Dwarf: All which was not capa∣ble
of daunting the magnanimous Heart of this
young Monarch, who shew'd a wonderful Intrepi∣dity
in his Locks and Actions, that encouraged all
who were concern'd for his Safety, and gave the
Dwarf and his Enemies some Confusion. But all
his Courage was not proof against what he saw the
Princess endure; when the Desart-Fairy, with her
Head cover'd with Snakes, like <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siphone,</HI> and moun∣ted
on a wing'd Griffin, struck her so hard with a
Lance she carried in her Hand, that she fell into the
Queen's Arms all over Blood. This tender Mother,
who was touch'd to the very Soul to see her Daugh∣ter
in this Condition, made most sad Complaints;
and for the King, he lost both all his Reason and
Courage, left the Combat, and ran to the Princess,
to succour her, or die with her: but the Yellow
Dwarf would not give him time to get to her, but
flew on his <HI>Spanish</HI> Cat into the Balcony where she
was, and took her out of her Mother's Arms, and
from all the Ladies, and then leaping upon the top
of the Palace, disappear'd with his Prey.</P>
<P>The King, confused and motionless, look'd on
such an extraordinary Adventure with the utmost
despair, since it was not in his power to help it;
when to compleat his Misfortunes, he found a Mist
before his Eyes, and himself lifted up by some ex∣traordinary
Power in the Air. For the wicked
Fairy, who came to assist the Yellow Dwarf in ta∣king
away the Princess, had no sooner set he Eyes
on the King of the Gold Mines, but her Heart grew
sensible of that young Prince's Merit, and that he
might be her Prey; she therefore carried him to
the bottom of a frightful Cavern, and there loaded
him with Chains fix'd to a Rock, hoping that the
Dread of an approaching Death might make him
forget <HI>All-Fair,</HI> and engage him to do as she would
have him. As soon as he arrived there, she re∣stored
him his Sight, and borrowing, by the Fairy-Art,
all those Charms and Graces that Nature had
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
deny'd her, appear'd to him like a lovely Nymph,
that was come that way by chance. “What is
this that my Eyes behold? <HI>said she:</HI> What have
you done, charming Prince, that you are kept
here?” Whereupon the King, deceiv'd by these
false Appearances, reply'd; “Alas! fair Nymph, I
know not what the infernal Fury that brought
me hither, would have; for tho, when she took
me away, she depriv'd me of my Sight, and has
not since appear'd, yet I knew by her Voice, that
she was the Desart-Fairy.” “Oh! Sir, <HI>cry'd the
false Nymph,</HI> you are in the hands of a Woman,
who will never let you go till you marry her;
'tis what she has done by several Heroes: she is
the most obstinate Woman in the World in these
Affairs.” But while she pretended to bear a share
in the King's Affliction, he perceiv'd her Griffin-feet,
which was always a Mark by which the Fai∣ry
was known in all her Metamorphoses, and which
she could not change; and seeming to take no no∣tice
of it, but speaking in an Air of Confidence,
said, “Indeed, I have no Aversion for the Desart-Fairy,
but I cannot bear that she should protect
the Yellow Dwarf, and keep me chain'd thus like
a Criminal: What have I done? I love, 'tis true,
a charming Princess, and had I my Liberty, it
would engage me in gratitude to love her.” “Do
you use Sincerity?” <HI>said the pretended Nymph.</HI>
“Doubt you of it? <HI>reply'd the King:</HI> I am a Novice
in the Art of Dissembling; and I must own to
you, a Fairy has much more to flatter my Vanity
with, than a Princess; but if I loved her to Di∣straction,
and she confined me, I should hate
her.”</P>
<P>Deceiv'd by these Words, the Desart-Fairy re∣solv'd
to transport him to a Place, as agreeable as
this was horrible; and to that end, obliged him to
get into her Chariot, which was then drawn by
Swans, whereas it was generally drawn by Bats.
But in what a Condition was this Prince, when as
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
he was traversing the waste Space of Air, he saw
his dear Princess in a Castle of polish'd Steel, the
Walls of which cast such a Reflection when the
Sun shin'd, that there was no going near it; she
was laid in a Grove by a Brook-side, leaning her
Head on one hand, and wiping away her Tears
with the other: and as she was looking up to Hea∣ven
to ask Relief, she saw the King pass along with
the Desart-Fairy, who, as she had made use of her
Art to seem handsome to that young Monarch, she
appear'd to the Princess the most charming Person
in the World. “What, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> am not I unfor∣tunate
enough, to be in this inaccessible Castle,
whither this ugly Dwarf has brought me; but to
add to my Misfortunes, I must be tormented with
Jealousies? Must I be inform'd by such an ex∣traordinary
Adventure of the Infidelity of the King
of the Gold Mines, who has certainly thought, that
by losing the sight of me, he was freed from his
Oaths? But who can this formidable Rival be,
whose fatal Beauty surpasses mine?” While she
was saying these words, the amorous King felt a
mortal Pain, in being carried away with such swift∣ness
from the dear Object of his Vows: had he not
known the Fairy's Power, he would certainly have
try'd to have got from her, either by killing her,
or some other means that his Love and Courage
would have suggested to him; but how could he
attempt any thing at that time?</P>
<P>The Fairy also perceiv'd the Princess, and sought
in the King's Eyes to penetrate into the Effect that
sight might produce in his Heart. “None can in∣form
you so well as myself of what you want to
to know, <HI>said he to her;</HI> the unexpected meeting
with that unhappy Princess, for whom I had once
some respect, before I was acquainted with your
Charms, gave me some small disturbance; but
you have so much a greater Sway over me, that
I would sooner die, than be false to you.” “Ah!
Prince, <HI>said she,</HI> may I flatter myself with having
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
inspir'd you with such favourable Sentiments for
me.” “Time shall convince you, Madam, <HI>reply'd
he;</HI> but if you would make me sensible, that I
have any part in your Esteem, deny not <HI>All-Fair</HI>
your Assistance.” “Do you know what you ask?
<HI>answer'd the Fairy, knitting her Brow, and frowning:</HI>
What would you have me make use of my Know∣ledge
against the Yellow Dwarf, who is my best
Friend, to force a proud Princess, whom I must look
upon as my Rival, out of his hands? No, I cannot
bear the thoughts of it.” At that the King sigh'd
inwardly, but durst return no Answer. At last they
came to a large Meadow, enamelled with various
Flowers, and surrounded by a deep River, into
which there ran several small Brooks, which form∣ed
Meanders about little Holts of Trees, where
there was always a fresh Air: at a small distance
stood a stately Palace, the Walls of which were of
transparent Emeralds, and as soon as the Swans that
drew them alighted, thousands of beautiful Per∣sons
came to receive the Fairy with Acclamations
of Joy, and Songs in praise of her Charms and her
Choice; which overjoy'd the Fairy, to hear them
mention her Amours. She led the King into the
most magnificent Apartment that had ever been seen
in the memory of Fairies, and leaving him there,
and thinking she was not sure she had captivated
him, she got into an obscure Place, from whence
she might observe all his Actions; and he fancying
she would watch him, went to a large Glass, and
said to it, “Faithful Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iser, permit me to study
out Ways to render my self agreeable to the charm∣ing
Fairy, whom I adore; for great is my Desire
to please.” And thereupon he painted, powder'd,
and patch'd, put on a magnificent Suit of Clothes
that lay ready for him, and adjusted himself the
best he could.</P>
<P>Upon this the Fairy went in unto him, so much
transported with Joy, that she could not moderate
it. “I shall not forget, <HI>said she,</HI> the care you have
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
taken to please me; you have found out the true
and only way: you see, Sir, it is not so difficult,
when People please.” The King, who thought
that saying fine things to the Fairy was the best
Card he could play, spared no soft Expressions at
this juncture, and by that means got leave to take
a Walk on the Sea-shore, which the Fairy, by her
Art, had render'd so dangerous and boisterous, that
no Pilots were so bold as to venture to sail in it;
so that she was under no Apprehensions of her Pri∣soner's
escaping, who thought it a great Assuage∣ment
to his Pains, to muse along, and think of his
dearest Princess, without being interrupted by his
hateful Goaler. When he had walk'd there some
time, kiss'd the Sand, and invoked the Powers of
the Sea, he heard a Voice, which made him give
great Attention, and observing the Waves to swell,
and regarding them stedfastly, he perceiv'd a beau∣tiful
Mermaid arise, with a Looking-glass in one
hand, and combing her Hair, which was gently a∣gitated
by the Winds, with the other. At this
sight the King was very much surpriz'd, but much
more, when it came and said to him; “I know the
sad Condition you are reduced to, by your Sepa∣ration
from your Princess, and the Desart-Fairy's
Passion for you; if you approve of it, I will carry
you away from this fatal Place, where, perhaps,
you may languish out thirty or forty Years.” The
King knew not what Answer to return, not but he
desir'd to be deliver'd from his Captivity, but for
fear the Fairy had assumed a new Form to deceive
him: and as he hesitated, the <HI>Syren,</HI> who guess'd at
his Thoughts, said, “Fear not, this is no Snare laid
for you, I am too much an Enemy to the Desart-Fairy,
and the Yellow Dwarf, to serve them: I see
your unfortunate Princess every day, her Beauty
and Merit raises my Pity; and I tell you again,
if you have any Confidence in me, I will assist
you to get away.” “I have so much in you, <HI>cry'd
the King,</HI> that I will do whatever you bid me;
<PB N="179" REF="188"/>
but since you have seen my Princess, tell me some
news of her.” “We shall lose too much time in
talking, <HI>reply'd the</HI> Syren; come along with me,
and I will carry you to the Steel-Castle, and
leave on this Shore a Figure so like you, that the
Fairy shall be deceiv'd by it.”</P>
<P>She presently cut down some Sea-Rushes, and
bundling them together, and blowing upon them,
said, “My good Friends, I order you not to stir off
from this Beach, till the Desart-Fairy comes and
takes you away.” Whereupon a Skin grew soon
over the Rushes, and they became so like the King
of the Gold Mines, that it was surprizing; they
were clothed like the King, and looked pale and
dead, as if he had been drown'd. After this the
<HI>Syren</HI> made the King sit upon her Fish's Tail, and
both sail'd away in a rolling Sea, with all imagin∣able
Satisfaction. When they were at some distance
from the Shore, the <HI>Syren</HI> said, “I will now tell
you how the wicked Dwarf carried the Princess
away; he set her behind him on his <HI>Spanish</HI> Cat,
and notwithstanding the Blood she lost by the
Wound she receiv'd from the Desart-Fairy, which
made her swoon away, he never stop'd to give
her Assistance, till he had her safe in his Steel-Castle,
where he was receiv'd by some of the most
beautiful Persons in the World, which he had
transported thither, who all shew'd a great desire
to serve the Princess; who was put into a Bed of
Cloth of Gold, embroider'd with large Pearls.”
“O! <HI>cry'd the King of the Gold Mines,</HI> he has married
her; I swoon and die away.” “No, <HI>said she,</HI> as∣sure
yourself the Princess's Constancy is too firm
to admit of that.” “Then go on,” <HI>reply'd he.</HI> “What
I have more to tell you, is, <HI>continu'd the</HI> Syren, she
was in the Grove you pass'd over, and saw you
with the Desart-Fairy, who was so painted, that
she seem'd to her of a much superior Beauty to
herself, and her Despair is not to be compre∣hended,
since she fancies you love her.” “I love
<PB N="180" REF="189"/>
her! <HI>cry'd the King:</HI> Just Heavens! how much is
she deceiv'd? What ought not I to do, to make
her sensible how much she is mistaken?” “Con∣sult
your own Heart, <HI>answer'd the</HI> Syren, <HI>with a gra∣cious
Smile;</HI> People that are deeply engaged have
no need of Advice on that account.” And just as
she made an end of these Words, they arriv'd at
the Steel-Castle, which on the Sea-side the Dwarf
had not fortified with those burning Walls.</P>
<P>“I know, <HI>said the</HI> Syren, the Princess is by the
same Brook-side, where you saw her as you pass'd
by; but as you will have a great many Enemies
to fight with before you can come to her, take
this Sword, with which you may undertake any
thing, and face the greatest Dangers, provided
you never let it go out of your hand. Farewel,
I shall retire under that Rock you see there; if
you have any need of me, to conduct you farther
with your Princess, I shall not fail you, for the
Queen her Mother is my best Friend, and 'twas
on her account that I have thus served you.” Af∣ter
these words she gave him the Sword, which
was made of one entire Diamond, that gave as
great a Lustre as the Sun; upon the receiving it, he
could use no words expressive enough for an Ac∣knowledgment,
but desir'd her to make it up in
thinking all that a generous Mind was capable
of.</P>
<P>But to return to the Desart-Fairy: When she
saw that her Lover did not return, she hasten'd af∣ter
to find him, running all along the Shore, at∣tended
with an hundred young Damsels, loaded
with Presents for him, some brought great Baskets
full of Diamonds, some golden Vessels of admirable
Work, some Ambergrease, Coral, and Pearls, and
some carried great Pieces of Stuffs upon their Heads,
of prodigious Richness; others, Flowers, Fruits, and
Birds; in short, every thing that might be accepta∣ble.
But in what a sad Condition was the Fairy,
when following this noble Troop, she saw the
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
Rushes in the shape of the King of the Gold Mines;
she was so amazed and grieved, that she gave a
terrible Shriek, that made the Hills echoe again,
and seem'd more furious than <HI>Megara, Alecto,</HI> and
<HI>Tisiphone</HI> together: she threw herself upon the Bo∣dy,
cry'd, howled, and tore fifty of the Persons
that were with her in pieces, as a Sacrifice to the
<HI>Manes</HI> of the dear deceased. Then she call'd ele∣ven
of her Sister-Fairies, to help her to erect a
stately Mausoleum to this young Hero; who were
all as much deceiv'd as herself by the <HI>Syren,</HI> who
was more powerful than they. But while they were
providing Porphyry, Jaspire, Agate, Marble, Statues
and Devices in Gold and Brass, to immortalize the
Memory of the King, whom they thought to be
dead, he thank'd the lovely <HI>Syren,</HI> conjuring her to
grant him her Protection; which she engaging him
she would, he had nothing to do but to advance
towards the Steel-Castle.</P>
<P>Thus guided by his Love, he went forward, and
looking carefully about, perceiv'd his adorable
Princess; but was not long without Employment,
for four terrible <HI>Sphinxes</HI> flew at him, and had torn
him into a thousand pieces, had it not been for
the <HI>Syren's</HI> Sword, which glitter'd so in their Eyes,
that they fell down at his Feet without any
Strength; and he gave each a mortal Wound, and
so proceeded on, till he met with six Dragons,
whose scaled Skins were harder than Iron: what∣ever
fear such Creatures might have put some into,
he was intrepid, and with his Sword cut them all
asunder, and thought he had surmounted the ut∣most
Difficulties, when he met with the greatest of
all; which was four and twenty Nymphs, holding
in their Hands long Garlands of Flowers, with
which they stop'd his Passage: “Whither are you
going, Sir? <HI>said they;</HI> we are appointed to guard
this Place, and if we let you pass, it will be bad
both for you and us, therefore pray be not obsti∣stinate:
sure you would not imbrue your victo∣rious
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
Arm in the Blood of so many young inno∣cent
Damsels, who have done you no wrong.” At
these words the King, who was a great Admirer
of the Fair Sex, and had profess'd himself always
their Protector, was so confounded to think that
he must force his Passage thro them, that he knew
not what to resolve on; when he heard a Voice
say, “Strike, strike, or you lose your Princess for
ever.” Whereupon, without making any Reply,
he threw himself into the midst of the Nymphs,
gave them no quarter, and soon dispersed them.
This being the last Obstacle he had to meet with,
he went into the Grove, where the Princess lay
pale and languishing by a Brook-side; and upon his
approaching trembling towards her, she flew from
him with as much Indignation, as if he had been
the Yellow Dwarf. “Condemn me not, Madam,
<HI>said he,</HI> before you hear me; I am neither false,
nor guilty of what you imagine, but only an un∣fortunate
Wretch, that has displeased you with
Repugnance to himself.” “Ah! barbarous Man,
<HI>cry'd she,</HI> I saw you traversing the Air with a
beautiful Person; was that against your Consent?”
“Yes, Princess, <HI>said he,</HI> it was: the wicked Desart-Fairy,
not satisfied with chaining me to a Rock,
took me with her in her Chariot, and convey'd
me to a distant Part of the World, where I should
have languish'd out my Days, without hope of
any Succour, had it not been for a kind <HI>Syren,</HI>
that brought me hither. I come, my Princess,
to deliver you out of the hands of those that de∣tain
you here; refuse not the Assistance of the
most faithful of Lovers.” Thereupon he threw
himself at her feet, and catching hold of her Gown,
unfortunately let fall the formidable Sword, which
the Yellow Dwarf, who lay hid behind some small
Shrub, no sooner saw out of the King's Hand, but,
knowing its Power, he ran and seized it.</P>
<P>The Princess, at the sight of the Dwarf, gave
a terrible Shriek; but all her Complaints served
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
only to exasperate the little Monster, who by two
cabalistical Words conjur'd up two huge Giants,
that loaded the King with Irons. “I am now, <HI>said
the Dwarf,</HI> Master of my Rival's Fate; however,
I will grant him his Life and Liberty, on condi∣tion
he consents to my Marriage.” “No, I will
die a thousand Deaths first,” <HI>cry'd the amorous King
in a Rage.</HI> “Alas! <HI>reply'd the Princess,</HI> the Thoughts
of that is the most terrible of all.” “Nothing
shocks me so much, <HI>answer'd the King,</HI> as that you
should become a Victim to this Monster.” Then
said the Princess, “Let us die together.” “No, my
Princess, <HI>said the King,</HI> let me have the Satisfac∣tion
of dying for you.” “I'd sooner consent, <HI>said
she,</HI> to the Dwarf's Desires.” “Oh! cruel Princess,
<HI>interrupted the King,</HI> should you marry him before
my face, my Life would ever after be odious to
me.” “No, it shall not be before thy face, <HI>reply'd
the Dwarf,</HI> for a beloved Rival I cannot bear.”
And at those words he stabbed the King to the
heart; whose Death the Princess was not able to
survive, but fell on her dear Prince's Body, and
poured out her Soul with his. Thus died these
two illustrious, but unfortunate Lovers, before the
<HI>Syren</HI> could apply any Remedy, all her power lying
in the fatal Sword.</P>
<P>The wicked Dwarf was better pleased to see his
Princess void of Life, than in the Arms of another;
and the Desart-Fairy being inform'd of this Adven∣ture,
conceiv'd as great an Hatred against the Me∣mory
of the King of the Gold Mines, as Love for
his Person, and destroy'd the Mausoleum she had
erected. And for the kind Mermaid, who was
grieved at this Misfortune, she could obtain no o∣ther
Favour of Fate, but to change them into two
Palm-Trees; which preserving a faithful and lasting
Passion for each other, caress and unite their Bran∣ches
together.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of Don Fer∣dinand
of Toledo.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Leonora</HI> had made an end of her Sto∣ry,
all the Company returned her their
Thanks for the Pleasure she had done them, and
rose, seeming to desire to walk and take the fresh
Air; and as they divided into different Sets, it was
no hard matter for Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to find an oppor∣tunity
of Discourse with <HI>Leonora,</HI> whom he met, af∣ter
he had been walking with the old Countess,
crossing a Jessamine Walk, where he stopt her with
Respect; and seeing he was alone with her, threw
himself at her feet, and said, “What Man, Madam,
can be more happy, since I am at your feet, and
can let you know how much I adore you.” “I
don't find, <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ply'd the beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l Lady, with an Air of
Modesty and Confusion,</HI> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Liberty is so well
established as you think for; I think I ought to
deprive you of it.” “Oh Madam! <HI>answered he,</HI>
you are too amiable and good to punish, with so
much Cruelty, and offence I could not help com∣mitting;
therefore since you have made a Cap∣tive
of my Heart, I hope I may be allowed to en∣tertain
you with your Conquest: but, alas! Ma∣dam,
if I durst, I should speak of some Return.” “I
never in my Life, <HI>said she,</HI> knew any one proceed
so far in so short a time: I know not yet whe∣ther
I ought to give you leave to speak to me—
But, alas! how can I refuse your Merit, the Sin∣cerity
of your Intentions, my own Inclination, and
the Proofs you have given me of your Passion,
since nothing can exceed your Perseverance.” “I
<PB N="185" REF="194"/>
shall never be failing there, Madam, <HI>answer'd he,</HI>
the Countess's ill Temper shall never dismay me,
and I think myself overpaid for my Disguise, and
the Complaisance I have shewed her, since I have
the Happiness of being at your feet, and you have
permitted me to declare my Passion, and that I
may flatter myself that my Respect and Constancy
may some time affect you.” “I do not forbid you
to hope, <HI>said</HI> Leonora; think but of rendering
your Sentiments as agreeable to my Father as to
me, and”—Here she made a Pause, being un∣able
to pursue a Conversation which began to be
so tender, but by her Trouble alone explained her
Thoughts. At which Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was so much
overjoyed, he took hold of one of her fair Hands,
and was just going to kiss it, when all on a sudden
he felt somebody pull him so hard by one Leg, that
he had much ado to avoid falling upon his Nose: But
what a Confusion was he in, when rising up sudden∣ly
to revenge himself on the Person that offered
him such an Insult before his Mistress's face, he
perceived it was the Countess, who had stood be∣hind
him, and heard all he said, without being seen
either by himself or <HI>Leonora.</HI> For this distrustful
old Lady having observed, that this pretended <HI>Moor</HI>
had soon left her to return to the Bower, and fear∣ing
lest he should meet with either of her Daugh∣ters,
followed him softly, and saw, by the light of
the Lamps, that he was at <HI>Leonora's</HI> feet: however,
though she was very much enraged, yet had she
patience enough to hear the tender Conversation
of these two Lovers; but when he catched hold of
her Daughter's hand, she thought it improper to be
any longer only a Spectator. “Ha! Don <HI>Ferdinand,
cry'd she,</HI> is it you who have taken all this pains to
disguise yourself like a <HI>Moor,</HI> to continue your
Addresses to <HI>Leonora?</HI> And is she so imprudent and
void of Reason to hear you, and suffer you to kiss
her hand.” <HI>Leonora,</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> were so
confounded, that it is more easy to imagine the
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
Condition they were in, than to describe it: How∣ever,
as he flattered himself, that the Countess had
not heard all they said, he soon recovered himself,
and with some boldness reply'd, “What, Madam, is
it a Crime in <HI>Spain</HI> to speak to a fair Lady, and to
kiss her hand; in my Country 'tis a sign of Re∣spect.”
“And in mine, <HI>said the Countess in a Passion,</HI>
'tis a sure proof of a Person's being undone; but
whether you are a <HI>Moor</HI> or a <HI>Castilian,</HI> I tell you,
I am no longer to be deceived.” Therefore load∣ing
her Daughter with the most cruel Reproaches,
she obliged her to go into the House with <HI>Matild<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
where she put them both under lock and key.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> were so much en∣raged,
that had it not been for Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> they
had returned the Violence she did them, by taking
away their Mistresses. The Lights and Entertain∣ment
vanished away like an Enchantment, the Coun∣tess
said the most severe things in the world to her
Nephew, and told him, “That if he went not away
immediately with his two Devils, (<HI>as she called
these two Gentlemen</HI>) she should have recourse to
whatever Rage and Passion could induce her to.”
Never any Entertainment ended so dismally; the
two Lovers and their Friend were in despair, to
leave the two young Ladies in such cruel hands;
for when we are really in love, we are more con∣cerned
for the Person we love, than our own par∣ticular
Satisfaction. But however they were ob∣liged
to go without their Supper, half dead with
Rage and Hunger; and what vexed them most, was,
that they had but very little talk with their Mis∣tresses,
and had left them exposed in the hands of
an enraged Mother, who doubted some time whe∣ther
these Sparks were Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don
<HI>James;</HI> for they were very well disguised: but at
last was persuaded within herself that they were
two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who, according to all appearances,
came only to see and speak to her Daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196"/>
As these Gentlemen returned back to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they
abandoned themselves so much to their different
Reflections, that they went a great way before they
were able to exchange a word with one another;
when Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> whose concern was not so great
as his two Friends, breaking the Ice first, said,
“Though I should not insult you on your Misfor∣tunes
with unseasonable Reproaches, I cannot for∣bear
asking you, my dear Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> if it was
the greatest piece of Prudence in you to throw
yourself at <HI>Leonora's</HI> feet, in a Garden where her
Mother might surprize you.” “Had it not been
for that unlucky Transport of his, <HI>added Don
James,</HI> all had gone well, and I had entertained
<HI>Matilda,</HI> without having been seen.” “Alas! you
talk like cold Lovers, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ferdinand, if
you had loved like me, you would find it an hard
matter to be with <HI>Leonora,</HI> without discovering
some Transports of your Soul.” “What do you
pretend,” <HI>reply'd Don</HI> James, (who waited impa∣tiently
to say something as severe) to love <HI>Leonora</HI>
“better than I do <HI>Matilda?</HI>” “Yes I do, <HI>answered the
other,</HI> and will maintain it.” At that Don <HI>James,</HI>
who was all Life and Vigour, opened one of the
Coach-doors, and jumped out; and clapping his
hand on his Sword, said, “Come then and main∣tain
it.” Whereupon Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> jumped after
him, and Don <HI>Francisco</HI> followed with all imaginable
precipitation: “What Fury possesses you, <HI>cry'd he,</HI>
would you cut each other's Throats on this ac∣count?
live for the Persons you love, who alone
are those you should persuade of the Greatness of
your Passions, without undertaking a Duel, which
they would be very angry at, should they hear of
it.” Notwithstanding these good Reasons, the two
Lovers had a great mind to be thrusting, to re∣venge
on each other the Injury the Countess of
<HI>Fuentes</HI> had done them; but at last were appeased
by the Intreaties of their Friend, and got into the
Coach again, both ashamed of a readiness that
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
wounded so much the sincere Friendship they had
sworn to each other. On the other hand, Don
<HI>Francisco</HI> was so uneasy at his quarrelling with his
Aunt, (for he could think of no ways to appease her,
and feared lest she should oblige her Husband to
resent it) that Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> observed it, and told
him, “That he should be in the utmost Despair at
all the Accidents that had befallen them; but that
he flattered himself that his Father's Return would
calm this Tempest.” When they got to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they
were informed of the Marquiss of <HI>Toledo's</HI> Arrival;
at which Don <HI>Ferdinard</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> were over∣joyed,
and renewed their Promises to their Friend
to marry his Cousins, if the Count of <HI>Fuentes</HI> would
give his Consent: and thereupon Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> de∣sired
him to trust him with <HI>Leonora's</HI> Picture, to con∣vince
his Father how lovely she was; which Don
<HI>Francisco,</HI> who was as desirous of the Match as him∣self,
made no di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>culty to grant, knowing that his
Cousin would be made the most happy Person in
the World, by marrying a Man of so great Quality
and Merit. Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> thanked them for the
Favour, and retired with Don <HI>James</HI> full of the
most pleasing hopes; they both resolving to ask at
the same time for <HI>Matilda.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, meeting with a Friend of theirs, and
talking of the Agreeablness of their Marriage,
they prayed him to speak to the Marquiss <HI>de Toledo</HI> a∣bout
it, and to contribute as much as possible to∣wards
the compleating of their Desires. Don <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
adding withal, “That he must acquaint his
Father, that he never could meet with a more
virtuous and charming Lady; and thinking it pro∣per
to convince him of her Beauty, gave his Friend
her Picture to shew him.” For their parts they
failed not to go and pay their Respects to the Mar∣quiss
<HI>de Toledo;</HI> and for Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who had his
Reasons to endeavour to please him, he never seemed
so glad of his Return, nor so complaisant and dili∣gent
before. Their Friend, to gratify them in their
<PB N="189" REF="198"/>
Request, waited on the Marquiss, and informed
him of the Advantage that might accrue from an
Alliance with the Count of <HI>Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es;</HI> moreover,
he shewed him that charming Lady's Picture, and
told him, “He was persua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that, without men∣tioning
her other Beauti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which were all per∣fect,
he must approve of her Face.” With which
the Marquiss was so much pleased, that he desired
him to leave the Picture with him.</P>
<P>When he was alone, he looked on it with an ex∣traordinary
Attention, and began to envy his Son's
good Fortune: “How happy is he, <HI>said the old Gen∣tleman
to himself,</HI> to please so lovely a Person? But,
(<HI>continued he</HI>) why am I thinking of marrying my
Son, I am not too old my self to renounce Matri∣mony
yet; I'll inform myself first of her Temper,
and then resolve.” Whereupon sending for Don
<HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdinand,</HI> and after having commended his Choice,
he enquired after her Humour and Disposition:
To all which his amorous Son answered, with all
the Exaggerations of a Lover, employing all his
Eloquence; insomuch that the Father was no ways
tired with asking Questions, nor the Son with an∣swering
them; and not thinking what Pains and
Trouble he had prepared for himself, observed with
pleasure the Attention his Father gave, and from
thence drew such happy Presages, that he no lon∣ger
disputed his own Happiness, knowing that the
Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> would not refuse him; and there∣fore
he continued to speak Wonder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Mistress,
to engage his Father to favour the Marriage, which
the Father promised him to do, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring him
some good News. Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> transported with
Joy, returned Thanks proportionate to the Happi∣ness
he hoped for, and as soon as he retired, writ
to <HI>Leonora,</HI> to inform her how Affairs went: which
Letter she received by her Cousin's, Management,
notwithstanding the Vigilance of the Countess.</P>
<P>While Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and his Mistress pleased each
other with these flattering hopes, the Count <HI>de Fu∣entes,</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
continually tormented with her Letters, came
to the <HI>Aspegnas,</HI> to remove those Sentiments of Jea∣lousy
which began to kindle again in her Breast;
which as soon as Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> knew, he informed
his Father of: who being particularly acquainted
with the Count, writ a Letter to him, to appoint a
Place of meeting; which being agreed on, and they
meeting accordingly, after the first Compliments,
“I come, <HI>said the Marquiss of</HI> Toledo <HI>to the Count,</HI> to
ask a Mark of your Friendship, and to give you
a Proof of mine, which may surprize you. In
short, I come to demand the amiable <HI>Leonora,</HI>
whose Beauty and Youth may make me so young
again, as not to be altogether disagreeable: and,
Sir, that a stricter Tie of Friendship may be be∣tween
our two Families, I ask the lovely <HI>Matilda</HI>
for my Son.” The Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> answer'd with
all the Civility and Tokens of Joy the Marquiss
could promise himself, and then embracing, they
gave each other their words; and having thus a∣greed
on the Business between themselves, resolved
to keep it private. The Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> could not
avoid speaking of it to his Wife to get her Consent;
but at the same time desired her to say nothing of it
to her Daughters, thinking his Approbation suffi∣cient.
The Marquiss of <HI>Toledo,</HI> when he returned
to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> told Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> “That every thing
went well, and that in a short time he should be
happy:” without entering into any further Par∣ticulars,
so that he could not discover the Trick his
Father put upon him; and as they were equally
impatient, they both pressed forward the Wedding-Day.
And for Don <HI>James,</HI> whose Passion for <HI>Matil∣da</HI>
was as great as Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s for <HI>Leonora,</HI> he
urged on the Marquiss to ask for her, that the two
Sisters might be both married at the same time; and
the old Fox, who took care to inform himself of all
that passed, promised to do it effectually: but fear∣ing
lest the Cheat should be found out before every
thing was made sure, he pressed for <HI>Leonora</HI>'s and
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
<HI>Matilda</HI>'s Return to <HI>Cadiz;</HI> which Pretext the Count
<HI>de Fuentes,</HI> who could not endure the Country, was
glad of, to bring his Family to a more agreeable
Place.</P>
<P>But as two such discerning Men as Don <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
and Don <HI>James</HI> were not to be long deceiv'd,
when they found out the Perfidy they were treated
with, they abandon'd themselves to whatever Rage
and Despair could inspire; and for Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI>
the Condition he was in, when he knew his own
Father to be the Object of his Revenge, is not to
be represented: “Alas, <HI>said he to Don</HI> Francisco, I
ought not to punish him, but myself, who shew'd
him my Mistress's Picture, and took so much pains
to inform him of all her good Qualities: How
could I think him capable of seeing it with Indif∣ference?
Has not Love Arrows to wound the Old
as well as Young? Where were my Thoughts,
when I shew'd him that charming Person?” Then
falling from these Reflections into others more vio∣lent;
“How can I, <HI>said he,</HI> excuse him for taking
from me the Person I love? I can hearken to no
Considerations of Respect, therefore no one can
be assured of the Possession of my Mistress, but
by my Death.” For Don <HI>James,</HI> he had no such
Ties to bound his Revenge, so he promised himself
one proportionate to the Injury receiv'd; but as they
both knew that <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> were to come to
Town the next day, they desir'd Don <HI>Francisco</HI> to
go and meet them, and inform them of all that
had pass'd: which Request he acquiesced with, not∣withstanding
his Aunt's Anger, to whom he had
often writ in vain, to endeavour to justify himself
on the Adventure of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and deliver'd a Let∣ter
from Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to <HI>Leonora,</HI> in these words:</P>
<P><HI>Beautiful</HI> Leonora,
“THE Excess of my Grief is not to be express'd
by any Words I can use: My Father would
destroy all my Hopes, rob me of your Heart, and
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
marry you; I have not enjoy'd myself since this
frightful News reach'd my Ears. I no longer
know what I am, nor what I do, you alone can
prevent all the Misfortunes of my Life; suffer
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to conduct you to some Place, that may serve
for a San<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uary to our Loves, which is the only
Remedy against such pressing Misfortunes: which,
Madam, if you refuse, I shall no longer seek to
live.”</P>
<P>Don <HI>Francisco</HI> arriv'd at the <HI>Aspegnas</HI> just as the
Countess was coming away, and the hurry they
were in at their Removal gave him an opportunity
of Discourse with his Cousins. But, O Heavens!
how great was their Grief at this fatal and unex∣pected
News, which surprized them like a Thun∣der-Clap?
However, Don <HI>Francisco</HI> comforted them
the best he could and told them, that if they would
but give their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsents, Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don
<HI>James</HI> would secure them against that detested Mar∣riage;
but that to succeed, they must play their
Parts well, and seem gay and pleased when at <HI>Ca∣diz,</HI>
and then he would warrant all things would
fall out according to their Wishes. “Oh! dear
Cousin, <HI>said</HI> Leonora, you flatter us too much;
after this Misfortune our Fears are great, and
Hopes but small, however, I am resolved to follow
your Advice, and will conceal my Sorrow as well
as I am able when at <HI>Cadiz:</HI> but I beg of you to
assure Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> that I am ready to do what
he desires.” “And rell Don <HI>James</HI> the same thing
from me, <HI>said</HI> Matilda, <HI>who had also receiv'd a very
kind and tender Letter from him,</HI> and assure him, that
my Heart and Hand shall be given to none but
him▪” “That's not enough, <HI>interrupted Don</HI> Fran∣cisco,
you must write, I will carry your Letters.”
Whereupon <HI>Leonora</HI> sat down, and writ these
Lines:</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="202"/>
“DON <HI>Francisco</HI> can tell you the Condition I am
in, and I sincerely believe I should not have
been able to have overcome the Violence of my
Trouble, had I not flatter'd myself with seeing
your Design succeed: which I not only approve
of, Sir, but will follow you with pleasure, on
Terms agreeable to my Honour and Virtue.”</P>
<P><HI>Matilda's</HI> was as follows:</P>
<P>“EXPECT not from me eloquent Complaints,
the Stroke that wounds you destroys me, and
the greatest Sorrow is sometimes best express'd by
Silence; but as it often proceeds to the utmost
Extremities, depend on it, I will second you in
your Designs to unite our Fates for ever.”</P>
<P>Don <HI>Francisco</HI> return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where the two
Lovers waited for him with Impatience, and were
overjoy'd at their Mistresses generous Resolutions;
who, while they were giving the necessary Orders,
arrived, and dissembled their Grief to admiration.
No sooner were they got to Town, but the Mar∣quiss
came to see them without Don <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdinand,</HI>
whom he told, with an Air of Confusion, of his
Intentions; assuring him, that if he readily con∣form'd,
there was nothing he might not expect
from him: to which Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who with force
constrain'd himself, reply'd only, that he should o∣bey
his Orders. The Marquiss neglected nothing
to disguise his Years to <HI>Leonora,</HI> but made use of
Powder and Perfumes, Diamonds and Embroidery,
and said all the obliging things to her he could
think on; which she reply'd to with Modesty. The
Visit he made was short, and as soon as he got
home, he sent both <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> some very
fine Jewels, which they look'd over with Sorrow;
when <HI>Leonora</HI> observed, in a little Box of Emeralds,
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
a Billet, which she open'd, and which contain'd
these words:</P>
<P><HI>Fair</HI> Leonora,</P>
<P>“WE shall come to-night at ten into your Gar∣den:
be there with Donna <HI>Matilda,</HI> provided
with Veils, that you may not be known; every
thing is ready for your Safety.”</P>
<P>They undress'd themselves in the Evening, and
fail'd not to be in the Garden at the time appoint∣ed,
accompany'd by Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> who let in the
two Lovers, muffled up in their Clokes, by a Door
he kept a Key of; who seeing their Mistresses veil'd,
conducted them, with a great deal of silence, to
the end of a Street, where a Coach waited for
them, that carried them to the Port, where a Sloop
attended, to row them to the Ship. As soon as they
were aboard, the Master led them into his Cabbin,
weigh'd Anchor, and with a fresh Gale sail'd for
<HI>Venice.</HI> Our Lovers, placed by their Mistresses, ex∣press'd
an extraordinary Joy and Acknowledgment;
but finding them a little surprized at, and reflecting
on what they had done, which seem'd extraordi∣nary
to them, who had been educated under so ri∣gid
a Mother, Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> penetrating into their
Thoughts, and not being able to see them uneasy,
in his amusing Temper, proposed to divert them
from their Spleen, by telling them a Story, since
they were not for lying down; at which they
seem'd very much pleased, and going upon the
Deck, because it was a clear Moonshine-Night,
and the Sea smooth and calm, the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptain asking

<HEAD>The Story of Young-and-Handsome.</HEAD>
<P>HERETOFORE there liv'd a Fairy, who
strove as much as possible to resist the Force
of Love, but all in vain; for that little God, with∣out
employing the utmost of his power, render'd
her sensible of it. A young Prince arrived at her
Court, who was both amiable and renown'd for the
great Actions he had done, which were not un∣known
to the Fairy.</P>
<P>This young Prince's Person answer'd so well the
great Reputation he had gain'd, that the Fairy,
who was not proof against so many Charms, in a
short time accepted of his Vows. The Fairy was
beautiful, and he really in love; she married him,
and by that Marriage made him a rich and most
powerful Monarch. After this Union, they lived a
long time happy; but the Fairy growing old, the
King's Love, tho he was as much in Years himself,
began to fall off, and he was taken with some of
the young Beauties of the Court: at which the
Fairy conceiv'd a Jealousy, that proved fatal to
many of her Rivals.</P>
<P>The Fairy, by this Marriage, had only one Daugh∣ter,
who was the Object of her Tenderness, and
in all respects deserving of it. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airies, her
Relations, at her Birth endow'd her with a spright∣ly
Wit, a most bewitching Beauty, and Graces more
engaging than both, with a Voice that captivated
all that heard it. Her Shape was perfectly fine,
and her Air noble; her Hair was a curious black,
her Mouth little, but always graced with Smiles,
her Teeth were of a surprizing Whiteness, her Eyes
black, lively, and sparkling, and her Looks so ten∣der
and piercing, that they created Love in all
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
Hearts: whereupon the Fairy named her <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI>
suspending all other Gifts, that she might
judge in the end what sort of Happiness she might
promise a Daughter so dear to her.</P>
<P>The Infidelity of the King was a continual Af∣fliction
to the Fairy; the Misfortune of not being
beloved, made her think, that the greatest of all
Blessings was to be always amiable. This Happi∣ness,
after a thousand Reflections, she endowed
<HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> with, who was then about six∣teen
Years old, when the Fairy used all her Know∣ledge,
that she should always remain the same as
she was at that time. What Blessing could she be∣stow
more valuable?</P>
<P>The Fairy buried the King her Husband, and
tho he had been false to her a long time, was so
sensibly grieved at his Death, that she resolved to
leave her Dominions, and retire to a Castle she
had built in a desart Country, which she had sur∣rounded
with a vast Forest, so that only she her∣self
could find the way to it.</P>
<P>This Resolution afflicted <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who
was loth to part with the Fairy, who commanded
her absolutely to stay; but before her Departure
she recall'd into her Palace, which was very fine,
all the Pleasures and Diversions she had banish'd so
long, and therewith composed the Court of <HI>Young-and-Handsome;</HI>
who in that agreeable Company was
comforted some time after, for the Absence of the
Fairy. All the Kings and Princes, who thought
themselves worthy of pleasing her, came in Crouds
to the Court of <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> to endeavour
by their Sedulities and Love, to render so lovely a
Princess sensible.</P>
<P>Nothing ever equalled the Magnificence and
Charms of her Palace, there were every day some
new Entertainments; every body was happy, but
those Lovers who adored without hope, for she
look'd favourably on none: but as they had the
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
happiness to see her often, the most indifferent
Looks were sufficient to stay them for ever.</P>
<P>One day <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> content with the
Happiness and Sweets of her Reign, was walking
in a pleasant Wood, attended only by some of her
Nymphs, to taste the Delights of Solitude; where
she amused herself with pleasing Thoughts, which
brought her insensibly into a delicate Meadow, en∣amelled
with Flowers of various Colours.</P>
<P>Her Eyes were engaged with a thousand diffe∣rent
and agreeable Objects, when perceiving a
Flock of Sheep feeding in the Meadow, by the
Side of a Brook, which by its Waters rolling a∣mongst
the Pebbles, made soft Murmurings; she
discover'd a young Shepherd, shaded by an Holt of
Trees, laid asleep by the Brook-side, with his
Crook set against a Tree, and a pretty little Dog,
which seem'd to be rather his Master's Favourite,
than the Keeper of the Flock by his side.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> went to the Brook, and look∣ed
on the Shepherd; but how fatal was that sight!
for Love sleeping in the Arms of <HI>Psyche</HI> never ap∣pear'd
with so many Charms. The young Fairy
stopt, being unable to resist some Emotions of Ad∣miration,
which were soon follow'd by more ten∣der
Sentiments. The young Shepherd seem'd to
be about eighteen Years of Age, very proper and
well shaped, and his Hair, which was brown, and
curled naturally in large flowing Rings, adorn'd a
most beautiful Face. His Eyes, which were then
closed, concealed from the Fairy new Darts, which
Love preserved to redouble her Tenderness.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> felt an unusual Disturbance in
her Breast, and had not power to leave the Place,
but took too much pleasure in those her Senti∣ments,
to seek to oppose them; she loved tenderly,
and thought at that time only of being loved a∣gain:
she durst not awake the Shepherd, for fear
of discovering her Disorder, but taking a pleasure
in revealing her Passion in a more gallant and a∣greeable
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
manner, render'd herself invisible, to
divert herself with the Amazement she design'd to
put him into. Some charming Musick was pre∣sently
heard, with a Symphony that struck the
Heart itself. These delightful Sounds awaken'd
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> which was the Shepherd's Name, who
then thought it only an agreeable Dream: But how
great was his Surprize, when rising off the Grass
where he was laid, he found himself in a sine and
magnificent Habit, of yellow Velvet trimm'd with
Silver; his Scrip embroider'd with Cyphers of
<HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> and tied with a Scarf of Flow∣ers;
his Crook of curious Work, adorn'd with
Jewels of several Colours, which form'd nice De∣vices;
and his Hat made of Jonquils and blue Hia∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ynths,
interwoven with great Art!</P>
<P>Pleased and surprized with his new Dress, he
view'd himself in the Brook, while <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some</HI>
was in a thousand Apprehensions, lest he should
undergo the same hard Fate with the beautiful <HI>Nar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssus.</HI>
But how much greater was his Astonish∣ment,
when he saw his Sheep fleeced with Silk as
white as Snow, instead of their ordinary Wool,
and bedeck'd with Branches of Ribbons of various
Colours; and his favourite Ewe, set off like the
rest, come skipping over the Grass, as if she was
proud of her Attire; and his little Dog with a Col∣lar
of Gold, set with small Emeralds, which com∣posed
these Verses:
<Q><L>How pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts the Heart, seiz'd with an am'rous Fire,</L>
<L>Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h'd by lasting Flames of Love?</L>
<L>Tho to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> handsome can create Desire,</L>
<L>Yet to be happy, we must constant prove.</L></Q></P>
<P>The young Shepherd judged by these Verses, that
he was obliged to Love for this agreeable Adven∣ture.
The Sun was then set, and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> possess'd
with most pleasing Thoughts, return'd to his Cab∣bin,
in which he observed no Change without;
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
but was hardly enter'd, before a delicious Odour
inform'd him there was something new. He found
his little Hut hung with a Tissue of Jessamin and
Orange-Flowers, the Curtains of his Bed the same,
raised up with Garlands of Lillies and Roses, sup∣ported
in their Beauty by an agreeable Freshness.</P>
<P>The Floor was China, whereon were represented
the Stories of all the Goddesses who fell in love
with Shepherds; <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who had a great deal of
Wit, observed it: for the Shepherds in that Coun∣try
were not common Shepherds, some of them be∣ing
descended from Kings and great Princes; as
<HI>Alidorus</HI> derived his Origin from a Prince that go∣vern'd
those People before they were subject to the
Fairies.</P>
<P>Till then the young Shepherd had been insensi∣ble,
but now he began to perceive that his young
Heart, tho he could fix on no Object, burnt to sur∣render;
he almost died with Impatience to know
the Goddess or Fairy that shew'd him such favour∣able
Marks of her Tenderness. He walk'd about
in the greatest Uneasiness imaginable, and knew
not what to think; Night came on, a fine Illumi∣nation
appear'd in his Cabbin, and his Musings were
interrupted by a delicious and stately Supper that
was set before him: “What, <HI>said the Shepherd smi∣ling,</HI>
always new Pleasures, and nobody to partake
of them with me!” His little Dog would have
play'd with him, but he was too much taken up to
answer his Caresses; when sitting down, a little
<HI>Cupid</HI> presented him Drink in a Cup made of one
single Diamond. He ask'd the little Love some
Questions, who, instead of answering them, drew
some Arrows, which as soon as they reached the
Shepherd, were changed into a sweet-smelling Wa∣ter.
<HI>Alidorus</HI> comprehended by these little Tricks,
that the little Rogue was order'd not to explain
this Mystery. As soon as <HI>Alidorus</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, the
little <HI>Cupid</HI> flew away, and the Table vanish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209"/>
Afterwards he heard a charming Symphony,
which creating a thousand tender Sentiments in
his Heart, his Impatience to know to whom he
was obliged for so much Pleasure, continually in∣creased;
when with a great deal of Satisfaction he
heard these words sung:
<Q><LG>
<L>Tell me, <HI>Cupid,</HI> what bright Form</L>
<L>Will wound the Swain I love;</L>
<L>Say what Charms I must put on,</L>
<L>That may his Passion move.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My constant Love, let him not doubt,</L>
<L>Tho that won't always please;</L>
<L>Great God incre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se my Stock of Charms,</L>
<L>My Truth will give me ease.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>“Come then, charming Object, <HI>cry'd the Shepherd,</HI>
and by your Presence compleat my Felicity: I
believe you too lovely ever to be capable of be∣ing
unfaithful to your Charms.” No Answer was
return'd, the Musick ceased soon after, and a pro∣found
Silence reign'd, which invited the Shepherd
to take a sweet Repose.</P>
<P>He threw himself upon his Bed, where he slept
but little, agitated by his Impa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience and growing
Passion. At Day-break he awaken'd by the har∣monious
Warblings of the Birds, arose and drove
his Flock to the same place, where the day before
his Good-Fortune began. He was no sooner sat
down by the Brook-side, but a Pavillion, of a
bright-green and gold-colour'd Stuff, was fasten'd
to the Boughs of the Trees, to secure him from
the Scorchings of the Sun. His Pavillion, Flock,
and Habit, surprized all the young Shepherds and
Shepherdesses about him; they came in great haste,
and ask'd him, with earnestness, the reason of those
strange Alterations: and <HI>Alidorus</HI> smiling, told them
all that had happen'd. There was not a Shepherd
but what was jealous, nor Shepherdess but blush'd
<PB N="201" REF="210"/>
with Rage and Envy, since there was scarce one
of the latter, who had not form'd Designs of gain∣ing
the Heart of this lovely Shepherd; and a God∣dess,
or a Fairy, were either of them too dange∣rous
Rivals.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who never lost sight of her
Shepherd, suffer'd the Conversation of the Shep∣herdesses
with impatience; some of them were
charming, and a lovely Shepherdess may prove a
formidable Rival to a Goddess herself. But <HI>Alido∣rus</HI>'s
Indifference, and their being obliged to leave
that Shepherd, and drive their Flocks further on
the Meadow, encouraged the young Fairy.</P>
<P>Some time after, when none but Shepherds were
with <HI>Alidorus,</HI> a delicious Entertainment appear'd
on a white marble Table, with Seats of Greens a∣round
it, of which <HI>Alidorus</HI> and those Shepherds
partook; when sitting down at the Table, they
found themselves clothed in magnificent Habits, but
not so fine as <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who shined again with Jew∣els.
A rustick Musick, but very fine, echoed all
around, and these words were sung:
<Q><L><HI>Alidorus</HI>'s Happiness confess,</L>
<L>By whom Love his Pow'r has shewn;</L>
<L>Swains that know his killing Charms,</L>
<L>Regard the Choice my Heart does own.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Shepherds Amazement increased every mi∣nute,
and some Shepherdesses, drawn by the Mu∣sick,
coming to the Brook-side, they began a very
agreeable Country-Dance. The young Fairy, who
was always present, but invisible, assumed, with six
of her Nymphs, the Habits of Shepherdesses, dress'd
with Garlands of Flowers, with their Crooks very
prettily wrought; at which time <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some,</HI>
who had on an Head-dress of Jonquils, which
had the most agreeable effect imaginable on her fine
black Hair, appear'd the most beautiful Person in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="211"/>
The Arrival of these charming Shepherdesses sur∣prized
all the Assembly; all the Beauties there con∣ceiving
Jealousies, and the Shepherds seeking, with
great earnestness, to pay them the utmost Respect.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who was not known to be
a Fairy, received all the Honours, and, like the
Loadstone, attracted all their Hearts; for there the
most sincere Homages were paid to Beauty alone,
which flatter'd <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> with the ef∣fect
of hers, since there her Rank had not the
least share.</P>
<P>For <HI>Alidorus,</HI> as soon as she appeared, forgetting
the Love a Goddess, or a Fairy, had for him, flew
to <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> and approached her with the
best Grace in the World: “Come, charming Shep∣herdess,
<HI>said h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> accept of a Place more worthy of
you; so delicate a Person is too much superiour to
the other Beauties, to stay intermixed with them.”
Then offering his Hand, <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> pleased
with the Sentiments she had inspired the young
Shepherd with, suffered herself to be led by him.
<HI>Alidorus</HI> conducted her under the Pavilion, where
some young Shepherds, by <HI>Alidorus</HI>'s Orders, brought
Bundles of Flowers and Greens, and raised a kind of
Throne, whereon they placed <HI>Young-and-Handsome.</HI>
The lovely young Shepherd laid himself at her feet,
the Nymphs sat by her, and the rest of the Company
made a Ring, where every one seated themselves
according to their Inclination.</P>
<P>This Circle of Beauties was a most agreeable sight,
where the purling Streams and the harmonious
Symphony, intermixed with the Warblings of the
Birds, which flock'd about them, made a compleat
Concert. Shepherds came in Troops to make their
Court to <HI>Young-and-Handsome;</HI> and one among them,
who was called <HI>Iphis,</HI> going up to the young Fairy,
“Though this Seat whereon you are placed by <HI>Ali∣dorus,
said he to her,</HI> is very agreeable, yet not∣withstanding
it is very dangerous.” “I believe, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Fairy with a Smile, capable of captivating all
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
Hearts,</HI> the Shepherdesses of this Hamlet will hard∣ly
pardon in me the Preference which <HI>Alidorus</HI>
seems to give me, before so many Beauties much
more deserving.” “No, <HI>said</HI> Iphis, our Shep∣herdesses
are more just, but a Goddess loves
<HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dorus.</HI>” Then he telling her the whole Adven∣ture
of that lovely Shepherd, and having made an
end of that Relation, the young Fairy turning her∣self
towards <HI>Alidorus,</HI> said, with a gracious Smile, “I
will not create myself so formidable an Enemy as
the Goddess, by whom you are beloved: Without
doubt she hath not destined me the Place I pos∣sess,
therefore I shall surrender it up to her;”
and in saying these words, she got up. “Stay, <HI>said</HI>
Alidorus, <HI>looking on her tenderly, and stopping her;</HI>
stay, beautiful Shepherdess, there is no Goddess,
whose Tenderness I would not sacrifice to the
Pleasure of adoring you: and that Goddess <HI>Iphis</HI>
hath told you of, is not very subtle, at least in
Love-Affairs, to permit me the sight of you.”
<HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> could not then return any An∣swer,
for they took her out just at that very
moment to dance; never any Person acquitted
herself with so good a Grace. And for the lovely
Shepherd, he even surpass'd himself. None of all
the magnificent Entertainment at the Court of
<HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> ever gave her so much pleasure
as this rural Assembly; for Love embelishes all
Places, where we can see the Persons we desire.</P>
<P><HI>Alidorus</HI> sound his Love increase every moment,
and swore a thousand times to sacrifice all the God∣desses
and Fairies in the World to the tender Pas∣sion
his Shepherdess inspired in him. <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI>
was charm'd with these Sentiments of her
belo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Shepherd, but was willing to make further
tryal of his Passion. <HI>Iphis</HI> was amiable, and if <HI>Ali∣dorus</HI>
had not been there, without doubt had had the
Preference. The young Fairy spoke to him twice
or thrice in a favourable manner, and dan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed often
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="213"/>
At which <HI>Alidorus</HI> conceived a Jealousy as vio∣lent
as his Love, which was not unobserved by
<HI>Young-and-Handsome;</HI> who thinking herself sure of
her Shepherd's Heart, forbore to torment him, and
spoke no more to <HI>Iphis</HI> all that day, but cast most
favourable Looks on <HI>Alidorus,</HI> which of themselves
were able to vanquish the most Insensible.</P>
<P>At night this fair Assembly broke up with Re∣gret,
when <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> would not permit
any of the Shepherds to accompany her, but was
follow'd by a thousand Sighs; however, she pro∣mised
<HI>Alidorus</HI> to meet him the next day in the
Meadow, and then went away with her Nymphs.
The Shepherds let them go, hoping, by following
at a distance, to know what Hamlet those Divine
Persons belong'd to; but as soon as they had gain'd
a little Wood, which deprived their Followers of
the sight of them, she and her Nymphs disappear'd,
and amused themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es some time, to see the Shep∣herds
searching out the Path they believed they had
gone: <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> observed with pleasure,
that <HI>Alidorus</HI> seem'd the most earnest. <HI>Iphis</HI> was in
despair, that they stay'd so long before they pur∣sued
them; and a great many other Shepherds,
whose Hearts the Nymphs had captivated, spent
most of the Night to find them out.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> return'd to her Palace, where
(tho a Fairy may have many Occasions to be ab∣sent)
she found all her Lovers very uneasy, that
they had not seen her all that day, but none of
them durst reproach her; for those who were her
Lovers, were forced to be submissive and respectful,
or leave her Court: So severe was she, that they
durst not tell her of their Tenderness; but hoped
only to gain her by their Assiduities, Respect, and
Constancy.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> seem'd to take very little no∣tice
of any thing; she eat but little, was often mu∣sing,
and the Princes her Admirers, who were
Observers of all her Actions, thought they heard
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
her often sigh. She took leave of her Court be∣times,
and retired to her Apartment; for when we
are to see again those we love, every thing that
obstructs that Happiness, seems cold and trouble∣some.</P>
<P>The young Fairy, with her Nymphs, were in∣stantly
at her beloved Shepherd's Cabbin, conceal'd
in a Cloud. He seem'd very melancholy for not
finding out the way his Divine Shepherdess had ta∣ken,
but found his Cottage as charming as when
he left it; only casting his Eyes on the Floor, he
perceiv'd it was chang'd, and instead of the Histo∣ries
of Goddesses, who were in love with Shep∣herds,
he saw terrible Examples of unfortunate
Lovers, who were not deserving of the Tenderness
of those Divinities.</P>
<P>“You are in the right, <HI>cry'd the lovely Shepherd;</HI>
you are in the right, Goddess; I deserve your
Anger: But why suffer'd you my Eyes to behold
a Shepherdess so lovely? Alas! what Deity was
able to withstand her Charms?”</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who was then in the Cot∣tage
when <HI>Alidorus</HI> pronounced these words, felt
all her Softness and Tenderness redoubled. There
appear'd another magnificent Supper, which <HI>Alido∣rus</HI>
made not so good a use of as that of the Night
before: He was too much in love, and at the same
time jealous; he often recall'd in his mind his
Shepherdess, her speaking to <HI>Iphis;</HI> but the Promise
she made him, that he should see her again the
next day, somewhat mitigated his Pain.</P>
<P>The little Love waited on him all the time, but
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> wholly taken up with his Disquiet, said
not one word to him. The Table disappear'd, and
a young Child making up to <HI>Alidorus,</HI> presented him
with two Boxes, in which were magnificent Pic∣tures,
and then flew away.</P>
<P>The Shepherd immediately open'd one of them,
wherein was the Picture of a young Lady of a
transcendent Beauty; under which these words
were writ in Letters of Gold▪</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="206" REF="215"/>
<HEAD>Thy Happiness consists in his Tenderness.</HEAD>
<P>“Who but he, who hath seen my Shepherdess
<HI>said</HI> Alidorus, <HI>looking on the Picture,</HI> could resist
these Charms?” Then shutting the Box, he laid
it carelesly on the Table, and afterwards he open'd
the other Box: but how great was his Surprize,
when he saw the Picture of his Shepherdess, shi∣ning
with all those Charms, that had made so live∣ly
an Impression on his Heart!</P>
<P>She was painted in the same Dress he saw her
in that day, with her Head-dress of Flowers; and
so transported was he with his Love, that 'twas a
long while before he perceiv'd these Words, which
were writ under it:
<Q>Forget her Charms, or thy Love will be fatal to thee.</Q></P>
<P>“Alas! <HI>cry'd</HI> Alido<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>: what Happiness is there
without my Shepherdess?” This Transport charm∣ed
<HI>Young-and-Handsome.</HI> That fine Picture <HI>Alidorus</HI>
despised was an imaginary one, by which the
young Fairy had a mind to try whether her Shep∣herd
would prefer her to so beautiful a Person,
who seem'd to be a Goddess, or a Fairy; but sa∣tisfy'd
with his Love, she return'd to her Palace,
after she had, by a Signal, call'd her Nymphs to∣gether,
who were gone to see after their Lovers.</P>
<P>Some of them were very well pleased with
theirs, having found them thinking and speaking
of them with Passion; others again were dissatis∣fy'd
with the Effects of their Beauty, having found
their Shepherds asleep, who in the day-time ap∣pear'd
very amorous, but were not in love enough
to keep them waking all night.</P>
<P>The young Shepherdess went to bed when she
arrived at her Palace, pleased with the Love of
her Shepherd, and agitated only with the sweet
Impatience of seeing him again. For <HI>Alidorus,</HI> he
<PB N="207" REF="216"/>
slept a little; and without disquieting himself with
the Menaces he read under the Pictures, thought
of nothing but the Meadow, where he hoped to
see his Shepherdess the next day, which he thought
approach'd too slow.</P>
<P>He drove his Flock to the fortunate Place where
he first saw <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> his little Dog watch∣ing
them, while his Master dreamt of his Shep∣herdess.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> was that day against her will
obliged to give Audience to several Ambassadors that
came from neighbouring Princes. Never were Au∣diences
more short; yet best part of that day was
spent in those troublesome Ceremonies, and the young
Fairy suffer'd as much as her Shepherd, who lan∣guish'd
under a most cruel Impatience. The Sun
set, and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who thought he should not see
his Divine Shepherdess that day, was in the greatest
Grief imaginable: He sigh'd and bewail'd his Ill∣fortune
a thousand times, made these Verses on her
Absence, and with the Iron of his Crook engraved
them on a young Elm.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thou bright Beauty of the Day,</L>
<L>Whom Love's Goddess can't survey;</L>
<L>Without Envy of thy Charms:</L>
<L>Shining Beauty, fairest Face,</L>
<L>Waited on by every Grace,</L>
<L>That the loveliest Female arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How prodigal has Love bestow'd</L>
<L>All the Artillery of the God,</L>
<L>You are made so charming fair;</L>
<L>'Tis by you he wounds all Hearts,</L>
<L>And no longer by his Darts,</L>
<L>Nymph, your Absence brings Despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fated to pass my Days alone,</L>
<L>My Sorrows now are constant grown,</L>
<L>Yet my Love and they are one.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="208" REF="217"/>
He had hardly done, before <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI>
appear'd with her Nymphs at a distance, all clothed
like Shepherdesses. <HI>Alidorus</HI> knowing them present∣ly,
ran, or rather flew towards <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI>
who receiv'd him with a charming Smile, capable
to create a Happiness in Gods themselves.</P>
<P>He spoke to her of his Love with an Ardour
that might have persuaded an Heart less affected
than that of the young Fairy, who would see what
he had engraved on the Tree, and was delighted
both with the Wit and Tenderness of her young
Shepherd. He told her all that happen'd the Night
before, and offer'd a thousand times to follow her
to the end of the World, to avoid the Love a God∣dess
or Fairy had unhappily conceiv'd for him.
“I shall lose too much, <HI>reply'd</HI> Young-and-Hand∣some,
if you fly that Fairy; for 'tis time I
discover to you my Sentiments, since I am satis∣fied
with yours. 'Twas I myself, <HI>Alidorus, con∣tinued
the charming Shepherdess;</HI> 'twas I that gave
you those Marks of my Tenderness, which, if
you are faithful, shall last for ever, and make us
happy.”</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherd, transported with Joy, cast
himself at her feet, and by his silence inform'd the
Fairy more, than if he had used the most pathe∣tick
Eloquence. <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> raised him up,
and he found himself clothed in a stately Habit;
then the Fairy touching the Ground with her
Crook, there appear'd a magnificent Chariot, drawn
by twelve white Horses very beautiful, and har∣ness'd
four on a breast. <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> got into
the Chariot, and made her lovely Shepherd sit by
her; and as soon as the Nymphs had taken their
places, the Horses, which had no need of any
Guide to obey the Fairy's Intentions, carried them
presently to a Castle <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> took great
delight in, which she had embelish'd with all her
Art, and call'd the Castle of Flowers.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="218"/>
The young Fairy and her happy Lover arrived
in a great Court, surrounded by Palisadoes breast∣high,
cover'd over with Jessamin and Citrons, by
which there ran a fine River, on the other side of
which were Meadows almost out of sight; where
the same River sported in several Meanders, as if
loth to leave so charming an Abode.</P>
<P>The Castle was much more to be admir'd for its
Architecture than Extent; there were twelve A∣partments
in it, each of which had its different
Excellency, they being large, but not capable of
containing the whole Court of <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI>
which was both numerous and magnificent.</P>
<P>The young Fairy always came to this Castle when
she had a mind to be retired, attended only by
favourite Nymphs, and some of the Officers of her
Houshold. She conducted her Shepherd into the
Apartment of Myrtles, where all the Furniture con∣sisted
of Myrtle, always in flower, interwoven with
so much Art, as shew'd the Fairy's delcate Taste in
the most simple things. Thus all the Apartments
were furnish'd with Flowers, which perfumed the
Air with their Fragrancy.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> had banish'd thence Winter,
and never permitted the Heats of Summer to in∣trude
on so agreeable a Place, but to enjoy with
more pleasure the Beauty of the Baths; which A∣partment
was made of blue and white Porphyry
finely wrought, with Baths of different Sizes and
Forms: that which <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> bath'd in,
was one entire Topaz of exquisite Beauty, over
which was a Canopy of yellow and silver Brocade,
adorn'd with Pearls, supported by four Pillars of
Amethist. <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who was entirely taken up
with the Happiness of looking on his lovely Fairy,
and seeing her sensible of his Passion, observed
hardly any of all these Wonders. A tender and
pleasant Conversation enchanted these happy Lovers
a long time in the Apartment of Myrtles; a magni∣ficent
Supper was served up in the Hall of Jonquils,
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
which was follow'd by an Entertainment, wherein
the Nymphs represented in Musick the Loves of
<HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Endymion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who forgot to return to her
Palace, pass'd the Remainder of the Night in the
Apartment of Narcissus's; and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> transported
with Love, was a long while before he could taste
the Sweets of Sleep in the Apartment of Myrtles,
where the Nymphs conducted him after Supper:
and that Night the Fairy, who was not willing to
use her Power to calm an agreeable Disorder, slept
not till Day-break.</P>
<P><HI>Alidorus,</HI> who long'd with impatience to see the
charming Fairy again, waited some time for that
happy moment in the Hall of Jonquils; he had neg∣lected
nothing in his D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, that could add to his
natural Graces and Beauties: and <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some,</HI>
who appear'd more charming than <HI>Venus,</HI> spent
part of that day with <HI>Alidorus</HI> and her Nymphs in
the Gardens of the Castle, the Beauties of which
surpass'd Description.</P>
<P>They had a small Regale in a delightful Wood,
where <HI>Alidorus</HI> for some time enjoy'd the Pleasure
of declaring his Passion for <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who
returning that Night to her Palace, promised <HI>Ali∣dorus</HI>
to come again the next Day. Never was any
Absence of so short a time so much regretted; the
Shepherd wish'd passionately to have follow'd the
young Fairy: she being willing to conceal her
Tenderness from her Court, desired him to stay in
the Castle of Flowers. None ever enter'd this Ca∣stle
without her Order, and for her Nymphs, she
fear'd not their discovering her Secrets; for those
of Fairies are always safe, and never divulged. She
ask'd <HI>Alidorus</HI> for his little Dog, to take him along
with her, for what pleases those we love, is always
dear to us.</P>
<P>After the young Fairy was gone, the Shepherd,
to entertain his Disquiet rather than divert it, went
farther into the Wood, to dream on his adorable
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
Fairy; and in a little Mead, that was in the midst
of the Wood, enamelled with Flowers, and water'd
by a delicate Spring, he saw his Flock skipping on
the Grass, and guarded by six young Slaves of good
Mien, clothed in Habits of Blue and Gold, with
Collars and Chains of the same: his favourite Ewe
soon knew her Master, and came to him; <HI>Alidorus</HI>
caress'd her, and was sensibly touch'd at the Care
<HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> had for him.</P>
<P>The young Slaves shew'd <HI>Alidorus</HI> their Hut,
which was just by, at the end of a shady Alley;
which little Abode was built all of Cedar, in which
there appear'd the Cyphers of <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> and
<HI>Alidorus</HI> mix'd together, with this Inscription in Let∣ters
of Gold, on a large Turquoize:
<Q><L>How pleasant is the sweet Abode,</L>
<L>Where my Charmer's Flock doth feed?</L>
<L>By the Shepherd I'm belov'd,</L>
<L>In Bliss no God can me exceed.</L></Q></P>
<P>The lovely Shepherd return'd to the Castle of
Flowers, charm'd with the Bounties of the young
Fairy, who the next day came again to her happy
Lover, as she promised: How great was his Joy to
see her again! All that the young Fairy had done
before, never gave him so great a Pleasure. She
spent almost all her time in the Castle of Flowers,
and seldom appear'd at her Court; where the Prin∣ces
her Lovers felt a mortal Grief, since all was sa∣crificed
to the happy <HI>Alidorus.</HI></P>
<P>But it was impossible for so great a Felicity to last
long without some Disaster. Another Fairy had seen
the lovely Shepherd, and found her Heart sensible
of his Charms.</P>
<P>One Evening, when <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> was gone
to her Court, <HI>Alidorus,</HI> taken up with his Love, sat
musing in the Hall of Jonquils; when hearing a
little noise at one of the Windows, and looking
that way, he perceiv'd a great Light, and soon after
saw on a Table, just by where he sat, a little Wo∣man,
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
about half a Yard high, very old, with Hair
as white as Snow, and an old-fashion'd Ruff and
Fardingale.</P>
<P>“I am the Fairy <HI>Mordicant, said she to the Shepherd;</HI>
and come to pronounce to you a Happiness, grea∣ter
than that of being beloved by <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some.</HI>”
“What Happiness can that be? <HI>said</HI> Alido∣rus
<HI>to her in a disdainful manner:</HI> The Gods them∣selves
enjoy not a greater Blessing!” “'Tis that
of pleasing me, <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swer'd the old Fairy haughtily:</HI> I
love you, and my Power is greater than that of
<HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> and almost equal to the Gods.
Leave this young Fairy for me; I will revenge
you of your Enemies, and on those you would
prejudice.”</P>
<P>“Your Favours are of no use to me, <HI>reply'd the
charming Shepherd smiling;</HI> I have no Enemies, and
would hurt nobody: I am too well satisfied with
my Good-fortune; and if the beautiful Fairy,
whom I adore, had been only a Shepherdess, I
had been as happy with her in a Cottage, as I
am in the most delightful Palace.”</P>
<P>After these words, the wicked Fairy seem'd all
on a sudden as large, as she seem'd at first little,
and in disappearing made a terrible noise. The next
day <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> came again to the Castle of
Flowers: <HI>Alidorus</HI> told her his Adventure; they both
knew the Fairy <HI>Mordicant</HI> to be both old and ugly,
and very sensible of Love. The two Lovers pass'd
a thousand Jests on her Passion, and never made
themselves a moment uneasy at the Effects of her
Revenge; for to be a successful Lover, and think
of Misfortunes to come, is a thing unusual.</P>
<P>Eight Days after <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> and the
lovely Shepherd, went to take the Air in a fine
gilt Boat on that River, which surrounded the Ca∣stle
of Flowers, follow'd by their small Court in
very fine Boats: <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI>'s was cover'd
with a Canopy of a light blue and silver Stuff, with
Oars of the same, attended by others full of Musi∣cians.
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> more in love than ever, regarded
nothing but <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> whose Beauty that
day appear'd more charming to him than ever.</P>
<P>In the midst of their Pleasures, twelve <HI>Syrens</HI>
arose out of the Water, follow'd soon after by as
many <HI>Tritons;</HI> who ranging themselves by the Boat∣side
which <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> was in, the <HI>Tritons,</HI>
with their concave Shells, perform'd a most agree∣able
Symphony, and the <HI>Syrens</HI> sang most alluring
Airs, which amused the young Fairy and Shepherd
some time. <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who was used to
such-like Diversions, thought it had been prepared
by those whom she entrusted with that Care; when
those perfidious <HI>Tritons</HI> and <HI>Syrens,</HI> laying their hands
on the Boat, sunk down with it suddenly.</P>
<P>All that <HI>Alidorus</HI> fear'd, was the danger the young
Fairy ran, and would have swam towards her, but
the <HI>Tritons</HI> carried him away; while <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some,</HI>
forced away by the <HI>Syrens,</HI> was put into her
own Palace.</P>
<P>As one Fairy has no power over another, the
jealous <HI>Mordicant</HI> limited her Revenge, in making
<HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> endure all the Torments a cruel
Absence could create. In the mean time <HI>Alidorus</HI>
was convey'd by the <HI>Tritons</HI> into a terrible Castle,
guarded by winged Dragons, where <HI>Mordicant</HI> re∣solved
to make the Shepherd answer her Love, or
revenge herself on his Disdain. They put him into
a dark Room, where <HI>Mordicant,</HI> all shining with
Jewels, came to him, and spoke of her Tenderness,
whom the Shepherd, in despair for being separated
from <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> treated with the utmost
Contempt and Disdain.</P>
<P><HI>Mordicant</HI>'s Rage was unexpressible, and her Love too
violent to destroy the Person who was the cause of it.
She resolved, after keeping <HI>Alidorus</HI> some time in this
most dismal Prison, to vanquish his Fidelity by new
Artifices; and to that end transported him suddenly
into a magnificent Palace, where he was served
with a Pomp no ways inferior to what he had seen
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
in the Castle of Flowers. She endeavour'd to dissi∣pate
his Grief by a thousand agreeable Entertain∣ments;
and the most beautiful Nymphs in the
World, which composed her Court, seem'd to strive
which should have the honour of pleasing him.
They never spoke to <HI>Alidorus</HI> of the wicked Fairy's
Love; that faithful Shepherd languish'd in the midst
of Pleasures, and was as much in despair for his
Absence from <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> at all the most
gallant Entertainments, as when in his dismal
Prison.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Mordicant</HI> hoped, that the Ab∣sence
of <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> the continual Pleasures
she endeavour'd to amuse him with, and the sight
of so many charming Persons, might in the end
render the Heart of the Shepherd unfaithful: her
Design, by presenting so many beautiful Nymphs to
his View, was to find out what sort of Beauty he
liked best, that she might assume a Form accord∣ingly;
sometimes she appear'd a charming Brown,
and sometimes a most delicate Fair.</P>
<P>Love, who can do every thing, then suspended
her natural Cruelty; but her Despair of not being
able to shake the Constancy of <HI>Alidorus,</HI> rekindled
her Rage so much, that she resolved to destroy that
charming Shepherd, and to make him a Victim to
that unshaken Love he preserved for <HI>Young-and-Handsome.</HI></P>
<P>One day, as she was watching undiscover'd, she
heard <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who was leaning over the Banisters
of a Gallery that look'd towards the Sea, sighing
grievously, and making such tender and piercing
Complaints, as shew'd the lively Passion he had for
the young Fairy; when transported with Rage, she
appear'd to him in her own natural Shape, and af∣ter
having cast a thousand Reproaches on him, con∣fined
him in a Prison, and told him, that in three
days he should be sacrificed to her Hatred, by the
most cruel Punishments a despised Lover could in∣flict.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224"/>
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> for his part, valued not his Life, which
was insupportable to him when absent from <HI>Young-and-Handsome;</HI>
and as he was satisfied he had no∣thing
to apprehend on her part from <HI>Mordicant</HI>'s
Anger, he expected, with Firmness of Mind, the
Death which had been pronounced.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> who was
as faithful as her Shepherd, groan'd under the Grief
of losing him. The <HI>Syrens,</HI> as soon as they had
carried her to her Palace, disappear'd; and the
young Fairy, not doubting but that it was the cruel
<HI>Mordicant</HI> that had carried <HI>Alidorus</HI> away, could not
disguise from her Court the Grief which her Ten∣derness
for her Shepherd, and her Loss of him,
created.</P>
<P>How many Kings were there jealous of the Mis∣fortunes
to which the wicked Fairy precipitated
<HI>Alidorus?</HI> What a Rage were the Princes her Ad∣mirers
in, when they understood that they had a
Rival beloved, and saw her shed Tears for him!
Yet their Hopes revived at the losing of him, for
they were sensible that <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> knew as
well how to love, as to please: They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edoubled
their Importunities, and every one flatter'd himself
with the pleasing hope of succeeding that happy
Lover; when <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> equally afflicted
with the Absence of <HI>Alidorus,</HI> and wearied with the
Love of his Rivals, left her Court, and retired to
the Castle of Flowers.</P>
<P>The sight of that charming Abode, where every
thing reminded her of her lovely Shepherd, aug∣mented
her Grief and Tenderness; when one day,
as she was walking in those pleasant Gardens, “A∣las!
<HI>said she, looking on the Ornaments that embelish'd
it;</HI> I once took a pleasure in you, but am now
too much taken up with my Grief, to think of
adding to your Beauties.”</P>
<P>As she made an end of these words, she per∣ceiv'd
the Flowers moved by a gentle Wind, and
saw them ranged in a different manner; at first
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
they represented the Cyphers of <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI>
then other Cyphers, which she knew not, and pre∣sently
afterwards they form'd distinct Letters, by
which <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> read these Verses:
<Q><L>To grace this Place bid gentle <HI>Zephir</HI> wait,</L>
<L>With springing Gales the Flow'rs to consecrate;</L>
<L>For <HI>Flora</HI> every day, Excess he shews,</L>
<L>And does his Care luxuriously expose:</L>
<L>Ambitious more under your pow'r to live,</L>
<L>If you but smile, much greater he will give.</L></Q></P>
<P>When she had read these Verses, she saw in the
Air a God, who came to declare his Love to her,
drawn in a Chariot of Roses by white Vapours.
As soon as the Chariot alighted on the Earth, the
God <HI>Zephirus</HI> got out of it, and approach'd the
young Fairy: He spoke to her with all the Grace
and Gallantry of a Deity, while the young Fairy,
tho pleased with so glorious a Conquest, answer'd
him like a faithful Lover. <HI>Zephirus,</HI> not at all dis∣may'd
at the rigorous Answers of <HI>Young-and-Hand∣some,</HI>
but flattering himself with the Hopes of soft∣ning
her Heart by his gentle Approaches, made con∣stant
court to her, and neglected nothing that might
please her: Which contributed much to the Glory
of <HI>Alidorus;</HI> thus to have a God for his Rival, and
to be preferred before him.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>Alidorus,</HI> that happy Mortal, was
ready to expire by the Fury of <HI>Mordicant;</HI> he had
been almost a year in that condition, when <HI>Zephirus,</HI>
who had no hopes of overcoming the Constancy of
<HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> touch'd with the Tears she
shed, and finding her one day more melancholy
than ordinary, said to her, “Since I am no longer
permitted, charming Fairy, to flatter myself with
the Happiness of pleasing you, I will however
contribute to your Felicity. Tell me what I
shall do, <HI>continued he,</HI> to accomplish it.” “Restore
me, <HI>Alidorus, reply'd the young Fairy with a Smile, that
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
created new Love in</HI> Zephirus; I have no power
over another Fairy: but you, <HI>Zephirus,</HI> are a God,
and your Power can reach that cruel Rival.” “I
will endeavour, <HI>answer'd</HI> Zephirus, to overcome
the Love you have inspired me with, to do you
an agreeable service.” After these Words he flew
away, leaving <HI>Young-and-Handsome</HI> full of pleasing
Expectations.</P>
<P><HI>Zephirus,</HI> fully convinced of the young Fairy's
Constancy, and having no hopes left, flew to the
horrible Prison where <HI>Alidorus</HI> was kept, attended
by six impetuous Western Winds, which open'd the
Prison-Doors, and afterwards carried the lovely
Shepherd in a bright Cloud to the Castle of Flow∣ers;
where, after he had survey'd him, his Asto∣nishment
was not so great at the Fidelity of <HI>Young-and-Handsome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alidorus</HI> and <HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> overjoy'd to see
one another again, thought each other more amia∣ble,
and loved more tenderly. Those two Lovers
return'd the God a thousand thanks, who after∣wards
left them, and return'd to <HI>Flora.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Handsome,</HI> willing that all her Court
should partake of her Happiness, celebrated her
Marriage by a thousand Sports throughout the Ex∣tent
of her Empire, notwithstanding the Grief of
the Princes her Lovers, who were Spectators of
the Triumph of the lovely Shepherd. And that she
might be under no Apprehensions for the future of
<HI>Mordicant</HI>'s Rage against <HI>Alidorus,</HI> learnt him the
Fairy Art, and presented him with the Gift of per∣petual
Youth. After having bestow'd so great a
Blessing on her happy Lover, mindful of his Glory,
she gave him the Castle of Flowers, and made him
to be acknowledged Sovereign of that Country,
where his Ancestors had formerly reign'd; so that
he became the greatest of Kings, where he had been
the most charming of Shepherds.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of Don Fer∣dinand
of Toledo.</HEAD>
<P>DON <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had gain'd so much the Atten∣tion
of his Hearers, that Day came insensibly
upon them, when <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda,</HI> who seem'd
no ways inclined to sleep, were desired by their
Lovers to go into their Cabbin, to take some Rest
in the midst of all their Troubles. They were
just entring into the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> when the
Weather changing suddenly, put them in some fear
for their Lives; and being toss'd by the Winds and
Waves some time, they found themselves drove a∣bove
an hundred Leagues from the Gulph, and up∣on
the Weather's changing, and the Sea's growing
calm again, were attacked by two Brigantines,
commanded by <HI>Zoromy,</HI> a famous Corsair, who came
upon them so soon after the Tempest, that they had
hardly time to think of defending themselves. After
the first Broadside, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain struck, and
our young Lovers saw themselves reduced to the
hard Necessity of acknowledging a Corsair for their
Master: I don't pretend to represent the Excess of
their Grief, which is much more easy to compre∣hend;
the Ship was soon crouded with <HI>Turks,</HI> who
not only robb'd them of their Effects, but also of
their Liberty: however, as they might judge, by
the Respect that was shew'd those Ladies, and the
Magnificence of their Clothes, that they were of
considerable Quality, they treated them with more
Civility than they could expect from <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zoromy</HI> took the two Lovers and their Mistresses
on board him, and bid <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda,</HI> in <HI>French,</HI>
not afflict themselves, for that he would sweeten
the Bitterness of their Captivity as much as possi∣ble.
To which they answer'd only with their
Tears, that discover'd the Greatness of their Sor∣row;
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
which went to the very hearts of the two
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho they supported it with a great deal
of Courage. When <HI>Leonora</HI> had an opportunity to
speak to Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> she said to him, “Since we
could not foresee our Fate, I think it would be
most proper you should pass for my Brother; and
if we are separated, you may comfort yourself
with this, that I'll sooner cease to live, than
change.” “Oh! Madam, <HI>cry'd the amorous Don</HI> Fer∣dinand,
what is this you tell me of? Can I possi∣bly
undergo the Misfortune of parting from you?”
“We must provide against every thing, <HI>replied she,</HI>
in the miserable Condition we are in, and pre∣pare
ourselves without Weakness.” “You have
too much Courage, <HI>said he,</HI> which I am afraid
proceeds from your Indifference!” “How can you
form to yourself such Suspicions, <HI>replied she, with
a melancholy Look;</HI> since what I have done for you,
in leaving my Father's House, is a sufficient
Proof of my Friendship?” “I am not ungrateful,
Madam, <HI>answer'd Don</HI> Ferdinand, but a miserable
Wretch, oppress'd with the most fatal Strokes of
Fortune, therefore pardon my Fears; were you
not so dear to me, I should be less unjust.” Such
tender Sentiments afforded the lovely <HI>Leonora</HI> great
Comfort, who express'd hers in Terms more pro∣per
to assuage his Grief. They agreed to go to
speak to <HI>Zoromy,</HI> to know his Intentions, and what
Sum he ask'd for their Ransom; but as soon as
that Proposition was made, the proud Corsair im∣posed
Silence: “These Ladies must think, <HI>said he,</HI>
to please the Grand Visier <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hmet,</HI> to whom I de∣termine
to make a Present of them, for the many
Obligations I have receiv'd.”</P>
<P>What News was this to Persons that loved so
well, and flatter'd themselves with being set at
liberty! When Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> told <HI>Leonora</HI> of it,
she was struck with the most lively Grief; but
thinking it too great a Weakness to abandon herself
entirely to her Sorrows, and seeing the Pain she
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
gave her generous Lover, she resolved to have re∣course
to her Courage, to stifle one part, and to
conceal the other as much as possible: And for Don
<HI>James</HI> and <HI>Matilda,</HI> their Sentiments and Resolu∣tions
were no less generous, they swore to each
other an eternal Love, which was at that time
their only Comfort. The Wind proving favourable,
they arrived in a short time at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where
the Ladies disembark'd, and were conducted to <HI>Zo∣romy</HI>'s
House, where they staid some time to rest
themselves after the Fatigue of their Voyage, that
they might recover the natural Vivacity of their
Eyes, and the Freshness of their Complexions; he
clothed them, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, in Cloth
of Gold, and having had their Jewels set in Chains
of Gold, fasten'd them to their Arms. Don <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
and Don <HI>James</HI> had Slaves Habirs of the same
Stuff, but their good Mien set them off more than
<HI>Zoromy</HI>'s Jewels. Thus dress'd, they were all four car∣ried
to a Country-Seat of the Grand Visier's, nigh
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> which he used to retire to with a small
Court to divert himself. <HI>Achmet</HI> receiv'd <HI>Zoromy</HI> after
an obliging manner, admired the good Mien of his
Slaves, and told him he had never beheld any thing
so beautiful as <HI>Leonora.</HI> As he spoke very good <HI>Spa∣nish,</HI>
looking on <HI>Leonora</HI> with an Air of Tenderness
and Compassion, he said to her, “Throw off, Ma∣dam,
those Chains, Heaven has made you to give
to all that see you.” To which Gallantry, <HI>Leonora</HI>
return'd no Answer, but louring, fell a crying.
“What are you grieved to be among us? <HI>continued
the V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sier;</HI> I can assure you, you had not more
Power in your own Country than here.” “I
ought always, Sir, <HI>replied she,</HI> whatever Bounty
you so generously promise me, to distrust my For∣tune
for the future, since what has befel me;
therefore I beg of you not to think me ungrate∣ful,
if I shew not all the Sensibility I owe to
your Favour: But, Sir, <HI>added she, throwing herself
at his feet,</HI> if you would dry up my Tears, be
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
pleased to set a Price on our Liberty, that we may
see our Friends and Relations again.” To which
he answer'd, “Since that fair Damsel is thy Sister,
and these Slaves thy Brothers, I will grant you
what you ask for them; but for yourself, I must
take some time to think of it.” By this Answer
they knew that <HI>Achmet</HI> gave them their liberty,
only to separate them from <HI>Leonora;</HI> and being re∣solved
not to leave her, they made the Visier this
Answer, with a great deal of Respect: “We de∣serve
not, Sir, the Favour you are pleased to grant
us, if we make use of it before we have shew'd
ourselves worthy of it; therefore we make bold
to beg of you to suffer us to remain some time in
the number of your Slaves, to pay our Acknow∣ledgments.”
Which <HI>Achmet</HI> consented to, and af∣ter
having told the Corsair, that he should always
remember the Present he had made, he conducted
<HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> into the Apartment of his Wo∣men,
where he kept some of the finest in the
World; he being a Man given up entirely to his
Pleasures, but not so much as to neglect any ways
the Affairs of the Publick. He was both handsome,
generous, and gallant, since he had seen several
other Courts, besides that of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>These two <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies he lodged in an Apart∣ment
of surprizing Beauty and Magnificence, and
came constantly every day to see <HI>Leonora;</HI> besides
the considerable Presents he sent, which were suffi∣cient
to inform the beautiful Lady what terrible
Circumstances she was in, and that he would not
wait long for Favours he might command: there∣fore
she sometimes told him, that whatever was
possess'd by force, always in the end had some fa∣tal
Consequence, and that an Heart that yielded
through Inclination, and not Violence, was by far
most preferable. And whenever he press'd her hard,
she always conjured him to give her liberty to ask
herself, whether her Esteem for him proceeded
from Authority or Tenderness; in which Proposi∣tion
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
he discover'd so much Delicacy, that he pro∣mised
to do every thing that might please her.</P>
<P>He used <HI>Matilda</HI> with all the Civilities imagina∣ble,
and to engage her in his Interests, made her
very considerable Presents; and for Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
and Don <HI>James,</HI> he treated them so generously,
that they seem'd more like Friends than Slaves.
But alas! what a melancholy Living was this for
Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> never to see his Mistress, and to
know she was in the power of an absolute Rival!
His Soul was in continual Alarms, first, for the
Weakness of the Sex, and next, on account of the
Visier's Power. Don <HI>James,</HI> whose Uneasiness up∣on
<HI>Matilda</HI>'s account was not so great, comforted
him the best he could, and endeavour'd to mitigate
his Pains. <HI>Leonora</HI> prolong'd the time the Visier
had prescribed for her to pledge her Faith, and re∣ceive
his, as long as she could; and tho she had
great reason to commend her own Proceedings, yet
was she no less afflicted than Don <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> In
short, the Visier press'd her at last to determine on
what she intended to do, telling her, that he in∣tended
to marry her, and make her happy, and
that he should expect her Answer the first time he
came; at which <HI>Leonora</HI> appear'd melancholy and
thoughtful. After he was gone, <HI>Matilda</HI> came in,
and seeing the Tears trickling down her Cheeks,
ask'd what new Subject she had for that Grief.
Whereupon she told her all that had pass'd, and
spoke of Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> with a great deal of Ten∣derness;
but perceiving the Visier listening behind
a Closet-door that belong'd to another Room, but
open'd into that, and seeming not to know he was
there, continued the Discourse, and said, “I am
sensible, that if Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had not been faith∣ful,
I should not have been able to have dispensed
with the Oaths we made, but should have lost my
Life, to have preserved my Heart his; nay, no
Separation should have alter'd my Sentiments:
but the ungrateful Wretch has been false; you
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
know, Sister, how basely he has used me; I am
resolved to forget him, for my own quiet sake,
and never to speak to him more.”</P>
<P>The Visier retired very much concerned, and
could not forbear asking <HI>Matilda</HI> several Questions,
who knew too well what Answers to return; and
<HI>Leonora</HI> being inform'd by her of what pass'd be∣tween
them, and knowing that she ought to ma∣nage
a Lover, in whose power she was, with a
great deal of Art, she sent for him into her Cham∣ber,
who, when he came in, discover'd by her
Looks the Grief she was oppress'd with. “Com∣plain
not, Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> that my Heart was en∣gaged
before I knew you, which I could not re∣solve
to own; but since you are inform'd of it,
you know also how false he has proved to me,
and if you will allow me some time to calm my
Troubles, I can promise you all the Marks of the
Acknowledgment I owe to your Goodness.” “I
confess, <HI>said he,</HI> my Love and Honour were both
offended, to find there was a Competitor with me
for your Heart; I was not surprized at thy In∣difference,
which I attributed to thy Youth: nay,
I flatter'd myself with the hopes, that I might be
the first that might touch thy Heart with some
Tenderness; but alas! cruel Fair, I dare not now
hope for it.” As he made an end of these words,
he cast his Eyes on <HI>Leonora,</HI> to seek some Ease in
hers; and she at that very time looking favourably
at him, pleased him as well as if she had said the
most obliging things in the World. Thus she ma∣naged
while she meditated on her Flight; to bring
which about, she neglected nothing to gain time,
and make use of the first Opportunity that offer'd,
to which end, Fortune was not slow at this time.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior return'd to <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
where the Visier was obliged to attend, and as
<HI>Leonora</HI> was not then in a perfect State of Health,
he would not put her to the Fatigue of a Journey;
when going into her Chamber to take his leave,
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
he said, “My charming <HI>Leonora,</HI> I am going from
you for two or three days, and seem as if I left
my better part behind me, since nothing but the
Remembrance of thy Promises could make me re∣solve
on it. Alas! what will become of me, if
you should not keep them, and I should lose
thee? O Heavens! if—” And stopping there,
he stood some time musing, which put <HI>Leonora</HI> into
a terrible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>right, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should have discover'd her
Design; but resuming the Discourse again, he
cry'd out, “No, I will not alarm myself with any
groundless Fears, <HI>Leonora</HI> has granted me her
Love.” “Yes, you possess it entire, <HI>interrupted</HI> Le∣onora;
I should think myself unfit to live, if I
answer'd your Passion with Indifference: go whi∣ther
you Duty calls you, and fear not but your
Return back will be acceptable to me.” <HI>Achmet</HI>
was so much affected with what she said, that he
gave her a thousand Assurances of an everlasting
Passion: and when he bid her adieu, it was in so
touching a manner, that one would have thought
him in the most inexpressible Agonies.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> having been in∣form'd
of their Mistresses Designs, seconded them
with so happy a Success, as to find out the means
to hire a Vessel: <HI>Leonora</HI> having gain'd some Chri∣stian
Slaves entirely devoted to her, who upon a
Signal given, set the Seraglio on fire in several
parts at once; the confusion and Disorder that
generally attend these sorts of Accidents, facili∣tated
our Lovers Entry into the Womens Apart∣ments,
and gave them an opportunity to carry off
<HI>Leonora, Matilda,</HI> and some trusty Slaves: and as
the Palace was situate by the Sea-side, Sloops wait∣ed
for to carry them on board the Vessel; which,
as soon as they came, weigh'd Anchor, and sail'd
away with a favourable Wind for the Gulph of
<HI>Venice.</HI> Never was any Voyage more agreeable and
pleasant, wherein these tender Lovers had the hap∣piness
of being together, and entertaining each
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
other with the Transports of their Joy. <HI>Leonora</HI>
and <HI>Matilda</HI> intended, when they came there, to
go into a Convent, till Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI>
had got the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI>'s and the Marquiss of
<HI>Toledo</HI>'s Consent; but upon more serious Reflections
they both thought, that if they should defer their
Marriage, their enraged Relations might prevent
it, and if it was consummated, it would be out of
their power, and that after some time their Anger
might be over; if not, the Jewels that the Visier
had given <HI>Leonora</HI> would keep an Equipage suitable
to their Birth: therefore they agreed upon it, and
this Resolution render'd the two Lovers Joys inex∣pressible.</P>
<P>But to return to the Marquiss of <HI>Toledo;</HI> he no
sooner knew of <HI>Leonora</HI>'s being gone, but he pre∣pared
to follow after her; and the Count <HI>de Fuen∣tes,</HI>
who was very much afflicted, went with him,
and neglected no means to overtake these run-away
Children, but, as it happen'd, took the wrong Rout.
Tho the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI>'s Concern was extraordi∣nary,
yet it became not so extravagant as the Mar∣quiss's
Grief, who threaten'd to disinherit his Son;
and was so much disorder'd thereby, that his Phy∣sicians
thought him in so great danger, that Don
<HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s Friends endeavour'd, by the respectful
Letters he sent, to appease him. At last, when he
perceived he should die, he forgave him, as like∣wise
did the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> his Daughters, who
were not only married, but their Choice proved
beyond what any of their Family could have pro∣posed
for them. When the Marquiss was dead, and
when Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had paid all the Honours due
to his Memory, he and Don <HI>James</HI> came to <HI>Cadiz</HI>
with their Brides, where they were complimented
by all that knew them; and among the rest, their
generous Friend and Relation Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> whose
Services had appear'd throughout so eminent, that
Don <HI>James,</HI> who was never ungrateful, ask'd him
how he should acquit himself of the Obligations
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
he lay under. Don <HI>Francisco</HI> told him he might ea∣sily
do that, by giving him his beautiful Sister,
whose Charms he had so long adored; acquainting
him withal, that she had no Aversion to his Pas∣sion,
and it lay entirely in his breast to make them
happy. Don <HI>James</HI> embraced him with all the
Marks of Friendship, and said to him in an obli∣ging
manner; “I only complain that you should
keep a Secret from me, in whose power it was
to serve you: My Sister shall certainly be no o∣ther's
but yours, and for her Fortune, I will make
it worth your Acceptance.” Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> whose
Joy was beyond description, said all the most en∣gaging
things he could think of, and then went
with Don <HI>James</HI> to the Convent where his Sister
was brought up; who not only discover'd in their
Conversation a great share of Wit, but could not
disguise her Sentiments so well, but that her Bro∣ther
penetrated into them. In short, he took her
out of this Religious House, the Wedding was so∣lemnized
at his own with great Magnificence; and
thus these three Lovers and their Mistresses became
happy.</P>

<HEAD>The History of the New GEN∣TLEMAN-CITIZEN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Young Man, whose Father was a substan∣tial
Tradesman in <HI>Paris,</HI> and had left him
a plentiful Fortune, having Vanity enough
to set up for a Man of Fashion, because
he was rich; and thinking that he might not have
Respect paid to his new-assumed Quality in a Place
where he had been known to have served behind a
Counter, bethought himself of going into the Coun∣try,
and making himself distinguished, by setting
up for a Man of Learning and Judgment; and to
that end bought a Closet of Books that were a
young Student's, who was lately dead, not doubt∣ing
in the least but he should be as good a Scholar,
since he had the same Books: and likewise, that he
might pass for a Man of Bravery, learnt to fence,
but in the main was a mere Braggadocio. After this,
he was in dispute what Country to pitch upon;
when at last bending his Thoughts towards <HI>Norman∣dy,</HI>
he fix'd there, and set out for <HI>Rouen,</HI> where he
found many of his Father's Correspondents, who
strove who should entertain him best, but all to no
purpose: he was a Man of Quality, and so no
Company for Tradesmen; and to persuade the World
he was really one, told the most ridiculous Stories
imaginable. After having enquired what Estates
there were to be disposed of thereabouts, and be∣ing
told of one that lay by the Sea-side; the De∣scription
of it pleased him so well, that he went
to see it, and bought it: but the House not being
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
fine enough, he pulled it down, and built another,
in which, as he pretended to every thing, he acted
as chief Architect. The Situation of this Estate
was very pleasant, it being along the Sea-side,
where a large River disembogued itself; over which
he built a great strong Bridge, and on that his
House, or Castle, as we shall sometimes call it, to
which you must ascend on either side sixty Stone
Steps with Iron Rails; so that if it either rain'd
hard, or the Sun shone hot, you run the risque of
being drown'd or burnt: and to complain, was an
unpardonable Fault.</P>
<P>But that our Gentleman-Cit might not be known,
he resolved to lay aside his Paternal Name, and call
himself Monsieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere;</HI> the length
of which Name he thought would conduce very
much towards the imposing on his Neighbours,
who were for the most part Country Gentlemen
of moderate Estates, and little acquainted with the
Court: and to make them yield the sooner to this
Imposition, always had his Pockets full of Letters
from Persons of the first Quality, of his own wri∣ting;
but in what Stile, Heaven knows. However,
they were always full of what News was most re∣markable
in that Province, and among the rest, the
King was always in pain for his Health. To sup∣port
the Rank assumed, he kept a Pack of Dogs,
and a Valet call'd <HI>Alain,</HI> who answer'd to as many
Titles as his Master pleased to employ him in Of∣fices,
either as Secretary, Hostler, Cook, Steward,
or Valet. One day, as this Valet was hunting in
some neighbouring Grounds, and had kill'd some
Game, a Gentleman of a passionate Temper meet∣ing
with him in his, beat him heartily; and upon
<HI>Alain</HI>'s threatning that his Master would make him
answer it at the Sessions, told him, that since he
thought to frighten him, he would let him see that
he knew who Monsieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere</HI> was, and
desired him to carry him four or five Strokes on
the Face from him, and ask him if he had ever
measured such with his Yard.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="238"/>
The Valet went home with swell'd Eyes, and a
bloody Face, without any Game, tho his Master de∣pended
on having some, to treat the next day two
or three honest Curates of the adjacent Villages.
When <HI>Alain</HI> had told him his Misfortunes, and that
<HI>Villeville,</HI> which was the Gentleman's Name, was the
Person who put this Affront upon him; he flew in∣to
a terrible Passion, for he was very cholerick,
and very much offended at any Disrespect shewn to
him: “I'll be revenged, <HI>said he, pulling his Hat over
his Eyes;</HI> was I not now busy, he should find the
difference between my being his Friend and Foe.
I have a River that runs under my House, and
the Sea ebbing and flowing before my Windows,
my House cover'd with Slates; and this sorry Fel∣low's
is nought but Mud-Walls, and thatch'd with
Straw.” While he was walking about in this
Heat, with his Hands behind him, in came the Ba∣ron
<HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> who was a Gentleman beloved
all thereabouts for the good Offices he did his
Neighbours; since there were no Quarrels, but he
made them up, nor no Marriage, or any Affair of
consequence concluded, before his Advice was ta∣ken.
He was of a good Family, but had little or
no Fortune, which made him submit to marry a
very homely Woman, who was resolved to lay out
what she could to make herself handsome, notwith∣standing
their Circumstances would not allow of it.
She had two beautiful Daughters, whom she could
not endure, because they were grown up too soon,
and all People of Understanding paid a greater de∣ference
to them; for which reason she kept them
lock'd up in a Summer-house at the end of the
Garden. In this Solitude they read as many Ro∣mances
as they pleased, and knowing themselves
handsome, and that Fortune was unkind to them,
they fancied themselves to be unfortunate Prin∣cesses,
who lived in expectation of some Knight's
coming to deliver them out of this inchanted Castle.
The little Acquaintance they had with the World,
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
together with these Chimeras, made them so much
out of the way, tho they wanted no Sense; yet
their Education render'd them singular, which
their Mother was not insensible of, but was very
easy on that score: provided they put her to no
expence, and that all was laid out on herself, their
Imaginations might be as extravagant as they plea∣sed.
Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was not a little con∣cerned
at the Extravagancies of his Daughters, and
if he had enjoy'd a more plentiful Fortune, would
have endeavour'd to make them sensible of them;
but since they could be no otherwise happy, than
in their Imagination, he was forced to let them
please themselves that way.</P>
<P>The Baron <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was very much surprized
at the Outrage he observed Monsieur <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
was in, and smiling, said to him, “I hardly know
you to-day; what is the matter with you?”
“What is the matter! Neighbour, <HI>reply'd the other;</HI>
should I tell you, you would die away in Amaze∣ment:
the Sieur <HI>Villeville</HI> has affronted me, kill'd
my Dogs, assassinated my Huntsman, and call'd me
Scoundrel; but—Well, I'll say no more, you
shall see—” “What, <HI>interrupted Monsieur</HI> de
St. Thomas, do you design to measure Swords?”
“Yes, I do, <HI>answer'd</HI> Dandinardiere, and will kill
him at the first Thrust, or else I shall not be sa∣tisfied.”
“You must moderate your Passion, <HI>said
the Baron,</HI> you know the cruel Fate of all Duelists;
should your Design be known to any of your Ene∣mies,
you would be obliged to quit the Kingdom
immediately.” “My Honour, <HI>answer'd</HI> Dandinar∣diere,
has always been dearer to me than my Life;
should I bear these Insults, I might leave my
House: These <HI>Norman</HI> Dogs treat me ill; not that
I call them Dogs, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> to affront you, but
only out of the Excess of my Passion to <HI>Villeville.</HI>”
“Sir, <HI>reply'd Monsieur</HI> de St. Thomas, I don't take
things so literally; but to let you see how much
I am devoted to your Service, if you are resolved
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
to fight, I am ready to carry the Challenge.” This
Proposition surprized <HI>Dandinardiere;</HI> the Danger he
was in abated his Passion, and his Friend's Zeal at
this time seem'd the most insupportable thing in
the World. After some musing, he reply'd, “Do
you think in your conscience, that if I should
fight with this Clown, that the Court will not
take notice of it?” “You need but appoint the
Place, <HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> I know <HI>Villeville</HI> will not
refuse you.” “Is he then a Man of Bravery?” <HI>an∣swer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>somewhat disorder'd.</HI> “Yes, to
Rashness, <HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> he has kill'd more Men
in his life-time, than some have Flies.” “I am glad at
my very Soul of that, <HI>said he, putting the best face he
could on the matter;</HI> I remember the sixteenth Duel
I fought, I kill'd my Antagonist before he well
knew where he was.” “Oh! I never question'd
your Abilities, <HI>added the Baron;</HI> but do you intend
me the Pleasure of being serviceable to you?”
“I am determined on it, but will do nothing rash∣ly,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere; I shall have the honour
to see you again in two or three days time.”
Then changing the Discourse, they talked of what
News there was from <HI>Paris</HI> and the Army.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> had much ado to forbear
laughing before our Cit's face, and therefore got
away as fast as he could, being naturally gay, and
of a quick and ready Apprehension, and seeing the
Perplexity <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was in, and that he was
more vex'd at himself for boasting so much, than
at <HI>Villeville</HI> for his Affront, was resolved to carry on
the matter to make sport: and having a Valet, a
notable Fellow, who was a <HI>Gasconiard,</HI> and no
ways wanting in all the natural Qualifications of
his Country, whom instructing in what he should
do, he sent, two or three days afterwards, to <HI>Dan∣dinardiere</HI>
in a Buff-Coat, a black crape Neckcloth,
a large-brimm'd Hat, a great leathern Belt, in
which hung the most terrible Sword that had ever
been seen since the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror.
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was walking along by the Sea-shore,
when all on a sudden he saw this Bullyhuff so nigh
him, that notwithstanding his great desire to shun
him, yet he could not well do it. “Are not you,
“<HI>said the other,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Dandinardiere?</HI>” “How!”
“<HI>reply'd he, trembling.</HI> How! <HI>continued the other,</HI> what
do you mean by that Answer?” “I mean, <HI>said</HI>
Dandinardiere, that I don't know you, and am
not very fond of any new Acquaintance; there∣fore
I answer in two words, that I am call'd per∣haps
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and perhaps not.” “Then your
How is explain'd, <HI>said our Bravo;</HI> for my part, I
must tell you without Ceremony, that Monsieur
<HI>Villeville</HI> being inform'd of your Behaviour, desires
you to meet him, three days hence, in the next
Wood: I am to be his Second, therefore it is
proper you provide one.”</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was so surprized, that this Hector
had time to get away, and hide himself behind a
Bank the Sea had thrown up, before he could re∣cover
out of his Fright; and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who in
such a case as this would rather have to do with
a Devil than a Man, persuaded himself that it was
an Apparition, and that some evil Spirit had put
on this fantastical Form to disturb his Repose: and
upon this Supposition deceived himself in his Con∣jectures,
that he might make the World believe it,
and come off with Honour. When he came home,
all pale and trembling, he found the Prior <HI>Rich<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cour</HI>
and the Viscount <HI>Berginville,</HI> who were come to pay
him a Visit, but saw him not, because they were
busy, looking at some old Heroes which <HI>Dandinar∣diere</HI>
had adorn'd his Hall with; but their Names
and principal Actions were writ in so small a Cha∣racter,
that the Prior and Viscount were disputing
thereupon, one saying it was <HI>Gillet,</HI> and the other
<HI>Gillot:</HI> Whereupon our Gentleman-Cit stepping up,
said it was <HI>Gille de Dandinardiere,</HI> his Grandfather,
who was bred up by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleventh, King of
<HI>France,</HI> in the Castle of <HI>Amboise,</HI> with <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
Eighth, his Son. “Now, <HI>said he,</HI> this little Prince
was a fine Child, and endow'd with great Sense,
and loved my Grandfather <HI>Gille</HI> to distraction; and
<HI>Lewis</HI> fearing, as the History says, that his Son
might, some time or other, dethrone him, to se∣cure
himself, brought him up very indifferently,
and fed him with gross Meats: but <HI>Gille,</HI> his Fa∣vourite,
had always Dainties, which he never
fail'd to let his Master partake of; insomuch that
to recompence him, he made him I know not
what, but I believe it was Constable.” “I am
sure there never was any of that Name,” <HI>said</HI>
“<HI>the Prior.</HI> That's no matter, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
at least if he was not Constable, he was Admiral
of the Horse; for 'tis certain, the Truncheon he
holds in his hand signifies no small Post.” Thus
he explain'd to them all that he had caused to be
writ of his Ancestors, which he had all by heart,
and had continued therein a long time, notwith∣standing
the Apparition he had seen, if the Vis∣count,
casting his Eyes on him, and seeing him as
pale as death, had not said, “Alas! Sir, you are
going to die, you are strangely changed!” “Nay,
after what has happen'd, 'tis a mercy I am alive,
<HI>said he;</HI> for if I had not had good Courage, I should
have died away immediately: Think with your∣selves,
Gentlemen, what Condition a Man must
be in, to see a Devil in a human Shape, with
Eyes full of infernal Malice and cloven Feet.”
Then he told them all that happen'd by the Sea∣shore;
but as serious as the Prior and Viscount af∣fected
to be, they could not help laughing at this
chimerical Fright of his, but wink'd, and signified
their Thoughts to each other by their Smiles:
then, after some Exclamations upon such an extra∣ordinary
Adventure, they advised him to let blood,
which he consented to with a great deal of plea∣sure,
because let things go as they would, he should
gain thereby some respite.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="243"/>
A Surgeon was immediately sent for, but before
he could come, Dinner was ready, and <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
would eat nothing, tho he was very hungry, and
the fresh Breezes from off the Sea had got him a
good Stomach, had not his Friends told him he
must, to get Strength to resist both Men and De∣vils;
which Advice he not only approved, but fol∣low'd,
and eat more than both his Guests. But as
the Surgeon lived a great way off, the Prior and
Viscount were gone before he came, each admiring
at his Folly of boasting he was descended from a
Favourite of <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, and his pretending
he was frighten'd by a Devil; both agreeing that
there was somewhat very pleasant in what he had
told them, and thereupon resolved to go to the
Baron <HI>St. Thomas</HI> to unriddle the matter. When
they came there, they found him in his usual Gay∣ety
of Temper, tho he had no great reason for it;
since his Wife and Daughters, as I have said be∣fore,
intermix'd some Gall with his Sweets. He
told his Friends the trick he had put upon <HI>Dandi∣nardiere,</HI>
and shew'd them the Man that had put
him into such a terrible fright, desiring them to
keep the Secret, and he would go and offer his
Service against <HI>Villeville,</HI> and give them an exact
account of <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Behaviour, when the Duel
should be proposed; with which they were both
so very well pleased, that they desired the Baron
it might be the next day.</P>
<P>When the Surgeon came, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was not
willing to lose one drop of his Blood, but paid him
liberally to say he had, and order'd his Servants to
say the same. The Baron went early the next
Morning, when the faithful <HI>Alain</HI> told him he could
not wake his Master, because he was very sick.
“Oh! <HI>said the Baron,</HI> I have business of the utmost
importance; therefore, good Friend <HI>Alain,</HI> open
his Door, for I must speak with him.” <HI>Alain</HI> could
not deny the Baron admittance any longer, who
found <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> in bed, in a black Waistcoat,
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
and a red woollen Cap on his Head, with a Toilet
answerable thereunto. “How can you sleep, <HI>said
Monsieur</HI> de St. Thomas, while <HI>Villeville</HI> is waiting
for you at the Place appointed? He told me ye∣sterday
he sent you a Challenge, and that he is
resolved to fight you, whatever comes on it; and
I cannot believe you will refuse him that Satis∣faction.”
At this <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> trembled so much
with fear, that he could not disguise it: “I needs
must own, <HI>said he,</HI> that I came not here to cut
Throats; had I any such Designs, I should have
stay'd in <HI>Paris,</HI> which is a murdering Place,
where some People take a pleasure in tormenting
others. I came into this Province to live peace∣ably,
and I have enough to render my Life plea∣sant;
why then should you advise me to risque
what is so dear to me?” “I advise you as a
Friend, <HI>reply'd the Baron,</HI> you ought to follow the
Steps of your glorious Ancestors; would you lose
your Honour for two or three Thrusts with a
Sword? If the word Duel seems harsh in your
Ears, we will change it, and call it a Rencoun∣ter:
I intend to serve you, and will be your Se∣cond,
tho I hazard much more than you; for I
have a Wife and two Daughters, but for a Friend
I will venture all.”</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> seeing himself thus closely press'd,
had recourse to a Feint, which had but ill Success.
He fell back on his Pillow, and cry'd out with all
his might, “I shall die, I shall die, I bled so much
in the Night, for my Bandage unbound, and I
lost two Pail-fulls of Blood, that I faint.” Where∣upon
closing his Eyes, he stretch'd himself out,
and resolved not to open them till the Baron was
gone, who pulled him about, shaked him heartily,
and gave him two or three Fillips on the Nose; all
which he took with a great deal of patience: then
running to a Bason of Water that stood by, he
threw so much in his face, that <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> fear∣ing
a second Inundation, open'd his Eyes, and
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
turn'd red again with Anger: “I beg of you, Sir,
<HI>said he,</HI> if you see me faint, to let me die, rather
than use me thus.” “I see my Zeal is taken ill,
<HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> but no matter for that, I am
your Friend, and ready to serve you: if you
would but fight, I should be satisfied.” “For
God's sake, Sir, <HI>answer'd</HI> Dandinardiere, let me
alone, for you are more troublesome than <HI>Villeville.</HI>”
“Would you be assassinated, <HI>added the Baron,</HI> for
that is the Fate of those who keep not the Assig∣nations
they make.” At this Menace he began to
be uneasy, and said, “Let me think a little, and
then I will give you a positive Answer.” Where∣upon
Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> thinking he should tire
him too much, if he should urge him any more,
took his leave, and went home, tho <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
press'd him hard to stay at Dinner.</P>
<P>When he was alone, he thought very seriously of
the Engagements he in honour laid under, and at
the same time believ'd he had found out a way to
preserve his Reputation, and to sleep in a whole
Skin, and that was to make <HI>Alain,</HI> arm'd cap-a-pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
fight <HI>Villeville,</HI> and for himself to appear in the same
Arms to the Baron and others; so that they would
not know but that it was himself that should
fight. Then calling his faithful <HI>Alain,</HI> he said, “I
do not doubt of thy Affection, but there are some
things that do not absolutely depend on ourselves;
for example, no Man can be brave, who in the
bottom is a Coward, since all his Endeavours to
be so are in vain: for my part, I was born with
a Princely Heart, full of Courage and Resolution;
but my only fault is, I have too much. Now
thou knowest, <HI>Alain,</HI> that that pitiful Fellow, <HI>Vil∣leville,</HI>
would fight me; if I should resolve on it,
he is a dead Man at the first Thrust; but I have
Riches, and should be sorry to lose them, if he,
as he is hasty, should kill me before I have put
myself in a Posture to prevent him: therefore
the only Remedy that I can think of in this busi∣ness,
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
is for you to fight in my stead, while I
pray for you.”</P>
<P>This Proposition seem'd very hard and unreaso∣nable
to <HI>Alain,</HI> who was of a very mild and peace∣able
Temper; who, after he had mused some time
to make a plausible Excuse, said, “Unless you
could give me your Face, Shape, and Air, how
do you think I shall resemble you, but Monsieur
<HI>Villeville</HI> will discover the Cheat?” “If I remove
this Difficulty, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, will you
promise me to fight?” “Yes, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Alain, <HI>think∣ing
it impossible;</HI> and if you don't, what shall I do to
you?” “What you please, <HI>answer'd</HI> Alain.” “Well then,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, we shall soon see whether you
have any Honour and Courage.” These words
put <HI>Alain</HI> into such a Fit of Trembling, that he
could not hold a Joint still; and it coming into his
head, that the same Devil that his Master saw by
the Sea-side, had taught him some extraordinary
Secret, “Be pleased, Sir, to hear me, <HI>said he,</HI> let
us have nothing to do with the Devil, I beseech
you; for I would not damn myself for any one:
I hate Sorcery and all its Ways, I renounce the
Bargain, if so; and will not fight if I was sure to
get an hundred Pieces by it.” This Cowardice of
<HI>Alain</HI>'s, inrag'd <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> so much, that he took
his Cane and laid it smartly over his Shoulders,
telling him that he might expect as much every
day, if he did not resolve to obey him; which
Usage so vex'd <HI>Alain,</HI> that he was in an hundred
minds to leave his Master.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> for his part, was full of Cares;
the appointed time drew nigh, and he had found
out no way to avoid it: however he resolv'd to
put <HI>Alain</HI> into Armour, he having bought two old
Head-pieces and Gantlets, and all things fitting for
a Warrior; and searching after him for that end,
found him set in a little dark Cellar, by a Runlet
of Wine, the Balsam of which Liquor, he thought,
might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e smarting of his Shoulders. “Come
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
up, you sneaking Dog, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>on the
Top of the Stairs,</HI> come and see whether I am a
Sorcerer, or thou art a Fool.” Upon which
<HI>Alain</HI> made haste to drink off his Can of Liquor,
and came up more brisk than he went, the Wine
having put a little Courage in him; and follow'd
his Master into his Chamber, but was terribly
frighten'd at the sight of the Armour, but much
more when <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> bid him put it on. “What
must I put on first, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> for 'tis Logick to
me.” “I'll shew you, you great Booby, <HI>said</HI> Dan∣dinardiere,
for if I am not your Valet-de-Cham∣bre,
you won't have Courage enough to equip
yourself.” Whereupon he put on the Cuirass,
which was so strait, that poor <HI>Alain</HI> was forc'd
to strip off his Waistcoat and Doublet, and ex∣pose
his Sides to hard Iron. “This is the Habit
of the greatest Kings when they go to War,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere.” “Ah, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain, those Kings
were certainly great Fools to wear such a scoun∣drel
Habit, when they might have what Velvet
and Sattin they pleas'd; for my part, I am sure, I
like a good Feather-bed much better.” “O Rascal!
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, you will never come to be
a great Man; for such Wretches as thou, are
easily distinguish'd from People of Quality, by
their Inclinations: now I, who am a Man of
fashion, I would eat, drink, and sleep in Armour.”
“Yes, <HI>said</HI> Alain; but yet you won't meet Monsieur
<HI>Villeville,</HI> which, thank you, you reserve for me
to do.” This unseasonable Reproach of <HI>Alain</HI>'s,
made his Master so angry, that without returning
any Answer, he clap'd on the Head-piece with so
much Force, and so little Skill, that he had like
to have kill'd him: for being as unexpert at it as
his Man, he put the hind part before; which
made poor <HI>Alain,</HI> who could hardly fetch his
Breath, stamp and tear like a Man mad: while
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who fancied it proceeded from his
Ill-will, and being not used to such Apparel, almost
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
split his Sides with laughing; but at last perceiv∣ing
his Mistake, took it off presently, and found
<HI>Alain</HI> chang'd as black as his Hat. After giving
him some time to recover, he put it on again, and
armed himself likewise, and drawing his Man to
a great Glass that stood in his Room, said to him,
“Now in thy own opinion who dost thou take
thyself to be?” “Why <HI>Alain,</HI> Sir, who should I
be?” “Go, you Blockhead, <HI>reply'd his Master,</HI> you are
Monsieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere;</HI> for when the Visors
of our Head-pieces are down, there's no diffe∣rence;
and I am sure <HI>Villeville</HI> can never distin∣guish
us. Have a good heart, honest Lad, I don't
intend you shall fight for nothing; I promise
you a Reward alive or dead: If you are kill'd,
you shall be buried as great as any Lord of the
Land; and if you come off safe, I'll marry you
to <HI>Kate,</HI> for whom I am sure you have a great
Respect. Hold, there's Half-a-crown and some
Farthings by way of advance: You know your
Fortune will be made.” Whereupon, <HI>Alain</HI> be∣ing
flush'd with Wine, and seeing the Money,
and relying on his Master's Promise to gain him
his Mistress, cry'd out, “I'll fight, since Riches and
my <HI>Kitty</HI> are the Prize:” which words pleased
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> so well, that he embrac'd him for
Joy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Prior and the Viscount
waited full of Expectation at the Baron's; and
when he came, were very much diverted with
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Fears, and resolved it should cost
him something to make peace. Not long after,
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who depended on <HI>Alain,</HI> arriv'd arm'd
Cap-a-pee, with a large Plume of Feathers on his
Head-piece, a long Sword; and, to look the more
terrible, had cut off the Tail of a fine Horse, and
fasten'd it to his Shoulders for a Shoulder-knot.
In this strange Equipage, he might very well be
taken for Don <HI>Quixot</HI> the second, tho not half so
valiant, follow'd by his worthy Imitator of <HI>Sancho
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
Pancho.</HI> Nevertheless he could not help being
afraid of meeting with <HI>Villeville,</HI> notwithstanding
he had great Confidence in his Visor. “It is impos∣sible,
<HI>said he to</HI> Alain, for my Enemy to know
me, if he should meet me; for I can tell him he
is mistaken, and that I am not <HI>Dandinardiere:</HI> and
after such a Declaration, it would be very imper∣tinent
in him to ask any more Questions.” The
Man approved of his Prudence: but as they were
thus talking, he began to fear lest <HI>Alain</HI> should find
out that their Arms were not alike; and should
alledge, that <HI>Villeville</HI> might easily discover who he
was. Thereupon, stopping all on a sudden, he
bid <HI>Alain</HI> go home, and not be uneasy if he did
not come that Night, for he might probably be at
the Baron's; and withal, charg'd him to exercise
himself in his Arms, because it might be of service
to him. This Order surpriz'd <HI>Alain</HI> again, who
now began to cool upon it, and fall off from that
Gaiety of Temper he acquir'd in the Cellar; and
answer'd with a Shrug of his Shoulders, “That he
did not care to fight; that he knew not what
belong'd to it.” Happy was it for him, that his
Master heard him not, for if he had, his Shoul∣ders
must have paid for it.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> follow'd the Road by the Sea-side,
till he came to a little Garden-house, at the end
of a Garden; from whence he heard somebody
say, Make haste Sister <HI>Marthonida,</HI> and come and
see a Knight in Arms; and not doubting but he
was the Person that was so call'd, lifted up h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Eyes, pleased to think he had excited so much
Curiosity: but how great was his Surprize to see
two beautiful Young Ladies at a grated Window,
who were the Baron <HI>de St. Thomas</HI>'s Daughters,
whom <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> had never seen, tho he had
been a visiting there several times. He made them so
low a Bow, that had not the Visor stood his Nose's
Friend, he had certainly broke it against the Pum∣mel
of the Saddle; which Salute they return'd with
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
Usury; and as both Parties were Strangers to each,
their Admiration was reciprocal.</P>
<P>As <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was capable enough of any Im∣pression
of Tenderness, he was so gallant as to be
over-joy'd at so unexpected and agreeable a sight;
and for the Ladies, their Heads were full of such
a number of great Actions and Adventures of Knights
Errants, Heroes, and Princes, that they were no∣thing
nigh so much surprized to see <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
in that comical Dress, as he was at two such beau∣tiful
Persons living retired from all the World in
a little Box by the Sea-side. <HI>Virginia,</HI> who was the
eldest of the two Sisters, and who call'd herself
<HI>Virginia</HI> instead of <HI>Maria,</HI> which was her true Name,
(as likewise did her Sister <HI>Martha</HI> assume that of
<HI>Marthonida</HI>) was the first who broke silence. “Tho,
my Lord, <HI>said she,</HI> you may have Affairs of the
greatest Importance that may call you away, yet
give us leave to ask you how you came to go by
our Windows.” Whereupon, <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who
was mightily pleas'd with the Title of Lord, that
he might not be behind-hand in point of Civility,
reply'd, “Since, divine Highnesses, you vouchsafe to
east your eyes on so unfortunate a Wretch, know
that an Affair of Honour obliged me to it.” “What,
noble Knight, <HI>interrupted</HI> Marthonida, are you go∣ing
then to fight? Who can be that hardy Man
that dare meet you?” <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was so much
transported with these fine things, that he thought
he had never discover'd in all his Life so much
Wit in any Person before; and thereupon reply'd
“I cannot, Ladies, tell you who the Gentleman is,
having some Reasons to the contrary; but I can
assure you, as soon as I have cut off his Head, I
will come and hang it at your Window as an Ho∣mage
due to your Beauty.” “Oh, my Lord, <HI>cry'd</HI>
Virginia, if you do so, we shall die away with
fear.” To which he reply'd, That rather than
displease them he would die himself; that his
Sentiments were so nice and delicate, that never
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
any Passion made so great a progress in so short
a time, and that he was in the utmost despair
that his Affairs should oblige him to leave them;
but having a mind before he took his leave, to
shew himself and Horse, and spurring and checking
him at the same time, the poor Horse not knowing
what he would be at, reared up an end, and
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> seeing himself in danger, out of fear
gave the Horse another Jerk with the Bridle, and
pull'd him upon himself; the sight of which made
the two confined Princesses shriek out: for lying
under his Horse upon sharp Flint-stones, he sadly
bruised his side, and his Head-piece, as he fell, un∣fortunately
flying off, he cut his Head cruelly.
<HI>Marthonida</HI> seeing him bleed, lost all patience, and
bid her Sister stay at the Window while she went
and acquainted the Family with the Disaster that
had befallen this Knight.</P>
<P>Away she ran to her Father's Study, where the
Viscount and Prior were drinking of Coffee with
him. “Make haste, Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> and come away
to the Sea-side: a Knight arm'd Cap-a-pee is dan∣gerously
wounded, and stands in need of your
Assistance.” “What, <HI>said the Baron smiling, who
was used to these Sallies of his Daughters,</HI> is he a
Knight of the Round-Table, or one of the twelve
Peers of <HI>France?</HI>” “I can't tell, <HI>said she, with a
serious and melancholy Countenance,</HI> who he is; but
his Horse is grey, with his Mane and Tail tied up
with Ribbons, and his Right-ear is cut off.” The
Baron and Viscount knowing by this Description
that it was <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and looking at one ano∣ther,
amaz'd at what <HI>Marthonida</HI> had told them,
without staying to ask any more Questions, made
all the haste they could to get to the Place she
directed them to, where they found our unfortu∣nate
Cit in a real Swoon; but were very much
surpriz'd at his Equipage and Metamorphosis. After
they had rubb'd his Temples with Hungary-Water,
and used the most proper means they could think
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
of, they brought him to himself again, and led
him to the Baron's House frighten'd almost out of
his Wits. <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida,</HI> who were all
the time at their Window, were at a great loss to
know how their Father came to be acquainted
with this valiant Knight, and to inform themselves
went into their Mother's Chamber, whither the
Baron was gone to tell her of the Adventure of
their Neighbour <HI>Dandinardiere.</HI> Whereupon, being
very sparing by way of Hospitality, tho profuse
enough in what related to herself, she ask'd, if he
design'd to stay long, and thought to be cured at
their expence. To which he made answer, that
she had no need to trouble herself about that, he
was very rich, and would make them amends.
Then taking her aside into his Closet, “The Viscount
<HI>Berginville, said he,</HI> has just now communicated
to me a Thought of his, which I very much approve
of; and that, is to persuade <HI>Dandinardiere▪</HI> to marry
one of our Daughters, which I should be very
glad of, since you know I have not much to give
them.” “But, <HI>reply'd</HI> Madam <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> (who was
full of her Whims) you know our Family, and
shall we marry them below their Rank, and dis∣grace
ourselves by so unequal a Match?” “Believe
me, Madam, <HI>said the Baron,</HI> Quality without a
Fortune answerable, is but grinning Honour; I
wish with all my heart, that this Citizen, as much
beneath them as you imagine, was so mad: but
don't you now go and set your Daughters against
it, for I know you are likely enough to undo
what I have taken so much pains about.” “What,
<HI>cry'd she, changing Colour,</HI> am not I as much their
Mother as you their Father? Ought not I to
have been consulted, and my Advice taken as well
as yours? No, Sir, my Daughters shall marry
none but a Marquiss or an Earl.” “Right, Madam,
<HI>said Monsieur</HI> de St. Thomas <HI>coldly,</HI> keep up the
Dignity of your Birth, and your Daughters fifty
Years longer.” Upon this the Baroness was so
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
enraged, that she rung such a Peal in his Ears as
brought the Viscount and Prior into the Closit.
“I appeal to these Gentlemen, <HI>said the Baron.</HI>” “And
for my part, I refuse them to be the Judges, <HI>answer'd
the Baroness;</HI> since I look upon them to be more
your Friends than mine, and as Advisers to this
fine Marriage.” But these Gentlemen having Sense
enough to enter into this Dispute without aggra∣vating
her, desired her to moderate her Passion in
an Affair so easy to be regulated, since she gave her
Consent, provided her Son-in-law was a Man of a
good Family; telling her, that they could assure
her his Hall was full of the Pictures of his Grand∣fathers,
and that they had observed among the
rest one call'd <HI>Gille de la Dandinardiere,</HI> who was at
least Constable in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. At
these Words the Baroness began to be a little
calm; and gave her word, that if it was so, she
would not be against it. Thereupon they advis'd
her to go and see him, and offer him her Assistance;
which she could not consent to, till she had been
and adjusted her Dress, and spent some Hours at
her Toilet. Afterwards she went into <HI>Dandinar∣diere</HI>'s
Chamber, who had been just dressed by a
Surgeon of the Village, who was a great Blockhead,
and said always he was afraid of curing but by
halves; and to perfect his Cure was very ready at
cutting off Legs and Arms, and upon occasion the
Head too: and having a mind to exercise his In∣cision-knife
on our wounded Knight, he no sooner
perceiv'd it in his Hand, but he cry'd out with
all his might, “Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> I put my∣self
under your Protection, let me not endure
any more.” Upon which Words the Baron put a
stop to Mr. <HI>Robert</HI>'s further Proceeding.</P>
<P>When Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> came, she found
him more vex'd than sick, and his Wound not to
be so great as she expected from so terrible a Fall.
She offer'd civilly to take care of him till he was
well, to keep him company, and also to bring her
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
Daughters to divert him. “I can say, <HI>added she,</HI>
without Vanity, that they have both Wit and a
nice Taste They are besides great Readers, and
make as good a use of it, for they can say <HI>Amadis</HI>
of <HI>Gaul</HI> by heart.” “I believe, Madam, <HI>answer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, all you say is true: but having
had the good-fortune to meet with two young
Princesses of an incomparable Beauty, my Thoughts
are so full of them, that I should be very glad of
their Company to blot them out of my remem∣brance:
not that what I say proceeds from any
want of Respect to the Ladies your Daughters,
but rather from my Fears of finding them too
charming.” At this the Baroness blush'd again
with Anger, and bridling to shew her Resentment,
said, “You are at your own liberty, Sir; I thought
to have done you a pleasure, but there is no
necessity for my Daughters coming.” Then rising
up, she took her leave, but in so ill an Humour
that she could almost have hang'd her Husband and
the Viscount, reproaching them with their usele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Endeavours. “I foresee, <HI>said she,</HI> and I am seldom
mistaken, that I shall have no reason to be plea∣sed
with this Visit: this Man is in love with two
or three Princesses, and cannot think of <HI>Virginia.</HI>”
Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was too great a lover of
Peace to make any Answer that might provoke her
any more, but went with the Viscount and Prior
to take a Walk in the Garden; where talking of
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Extravagances, he said, he could
not imagine who he meant, and where he had
seen those charming Princesses he spoke of, and
that he verily believ'd his Head was turn'd. “Then
the blame lies at your door, <HI>answer'd the Viscount;</HI>
for since the Challenge the <HI>Gasconiard</HI> carry'd
from <HI>Villeville,</HI> he has not been sensible, and his
being thus in Armour is a convincing Proof of
it.”</P>
<P>The next day these three Gentlemen went to
pay him a Visit in his Chamber; when after some
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
small talk, he seem'd desirous to have a little private
discourse with the Baron; whereupon the other
two retired. When they were alone, <HI>he said,</HI> ta∣king
the Baron's Hand between his, “May I de∣pend
on you as a true Friend?” “That you may
undoubtedly, <HI>answer'd the Baron,</HI> since I profess
myself so.” “You must know then, <HI>said</HI> Dandi∣nardiere,
that I design'd to meet <HI>Villeville</HI> in Arms,
as you saw me; I never fight otherwise: and if
he does not like that, he may let me alone, for
I won't abate a Gantlet. I came to you, to de∣sire
you to tell him to provide the like Arms,
thinking he might not have any by him, being
unwilling to take any advantage of him, having
the Rules of Honour and Chivalry writ in my
Face: but not to weary you with too long a dis∣course,
I will open my Mind to you in three
Words, and tell you I am in love.” “How long
have you been in Love, <HI>said the Baron?</HI>” “Four
and twenty Hours and some Minutes, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
if I reckon right: Nay, I have not always been
insensible to the Charms of Beauty. I have been
in love before, and have perform'd some Gal∣lantries
that surpriz'd all <HI>Paris,</HI> and fill'd up a
Paper call'd the <HI>Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury Galante.</HI> I short, some
Dutchesses that shall be nameless, having dealt
unhandsomely by me, and been false to me, I
must own to you, I laid it so much to heart,
and was so much enraged against my cruel Stars,
I came to throw myself into the Sea; but finding
the Situation pleasant, I thought it better to
build me an House, and live here in a lethargick
Philosophy. Thus, Sir, I lived free from Love,
Law-suits, and Ambition, and enjoy'd myself; when
my first Misfortune began by <HI>Villeville</HI>'s Violence,
and <HI>Alain</HI>'s impertinently bragging. That Rascal
has brought an Affair of Honour upon my hands,
which oppresses me like a huge Mountain; for
I have no desire to lose my Estate, and be banish'd
<HI>France.</HI> However, I have resolved on this unhap∣py
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
Duel, on condition, as I have said, that I fight
in Armour: of which I was coming to inform
you; when, as I was riding along by the Shore,
I heard two young Persons talking loud, who
charm'd me with the Sweetness of their Voices;
when looking about, I saw in a little Box with
Iron-barr'd Windows, two Princesses or Demi-Princesses,
which made me over-joy'd; particularly
the Fair-one has stole my Heart. Their Conver∣sation
was so polite and pretty, and they talk'd
with so great an Energy, and—that I never
should have done, if I should express the Agree∣ableness
thereof; and when they call'd me my
Lord, which shew'd that they were, or had
been breed up in Courts, methoughts they
rais'd up my Heart as a Kite does a Pidgeon. In
the midst of the Respect and Admiration they
created in my Heart, I knew not what I did;
and instead of giving myself an Air on horse∣back,
I unfortunately fell, and bruised my Head
against the Stones; so that I am at present in
love, sick, ingaged in a Quarrel with <HI>Villeville,</HI>
and the most unfortunate of all Men.” Here
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was silent some time, to fetch two or
three Sighs like a Man oppress'd with Sorrows;
while the Baron who heard him without any in∣terruption,
lifted up his Hands and Eyes towards
Heaven, to shew his Surprize at what he had re∣lated;
and being not sparing of his Sighs, sigh'd in
his turn. “Fear not, dear Friend, <HI>said he,</HI> we must
hope all from Time.” “Alas, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Dandinar∣diere,
I am in the utmost confusion: but what
I am now most concern'd at, is, for my Love and
Health; therefore I desire you would send for
a more able Surgeon than Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> and write
a Letter for me to those beautiful Persons I told
you of.” “If you will dictate, <HI>said Monsieur</HI> de St.
Thomas, I shall be very ready to be your Secre∣tary.”
“I would not give you that trouble, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, if my Head was better; but it is so
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
ill, that I don't know how to frame the many
things I have to say to them.” “You have no
need of any Assistance, <HI>said the Baron,</HI> you are
smitten, and want no Wit, therefore begin.”
While the Baron was folding his Paper, and pre∣paring
his Pen, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was musing and bi∣ring
his Nails, and then dictated as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Imprison'd Highnesses,</HI>
“YOU set all the World on fire; for methinks
you are two Suns, which reflecting on the
Chrystal Optick of my Eyes, have reduced my
Heart to Ashes. Yes, my Fair-ones, I am a very
Furnace since that fatal and happy Moment I
saw you at the Window; and my Reason has
evaporated so much, as to permit me to sacrifice
my tender Heart. I was not able to govern
myself, you were the guilty Witnesses of my
Fall. I have split my Blood at your Walls,
and would pour out my Soul, if the Sacrifice
was agreeable to you.”</P>
<CLOSER>I am, Ladies, Your most submissive Slave,
<HI>George Dandinardiere,</HI> Grandson to
<HI>Gille de la Dandinardiere,</HI> Favourite
to <HI>Charles VIII.</HI> and Constable, or some∣thing
like it.</CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>“Ah, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> (overjoy'd, after he had read his
Letter several times over) here is a Letter, which
tho it has cost me some pains, yet it is excel∣lent.
I see I have not lost the Stile so much
admired at Court, which distinguished me so
much there.” “I am so confounded, <HI>said the
Baron,</HI> to see with what ease you did it, that I
am almost angry with myself. I could as soon
eat Pen, Ink, and Paper, as do so much in a
Month. How happy is a Man that has so much
Wit!” “Ho, ho! my dear Baron, <HI>said our Gentlema<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Cit,</HI>
you praise me too much, and make me too
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
vain: but I must confess, I am infinitely well
pleased with the Comparison of the Optick Glass,
it is what we call a new Thought.” “It is what
we call sublime, <HI>answer'd the Baron.</HI>” “I know,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, I have an excellent Genius
this way, and need yield to none; but let us
wrap it up so nice and gallantly, that it may an∣swer
to the Inside: it must be in green Silk with
a Device. I have a Seal in my Pocket which
will be very proper; and that is a Woman lean∣ing
on an Anchor with these Words, <HI>Hope's the
Food of Love.</HI>” “I remember, <HI>said</HI> Monsieur <HI>de St.
Thomas,</HI> I had just such another.” “Then it came
from me, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>boldly,</HI> for all the
Court admir'd it; the King himself had one cut
after mine, for no Device was approved but what
was done after my manner.” “I make no dispute
of what you say, <HI>continued the Baron,</HI> you have so
much Fire and Vivacity, that you must succeed
in whatever you undertake: but I don't know
whether my Wife may have any plain green Silk.”
“It's no matter whether it is plain or not, <HI>said</HI>
Dandinardiere, if it be but green Silk.”</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> went out, and sent the
<HI>Gascoin,</HI> for he durst not let him come in lest
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> should know him; who after he had
sought over twenty Drawers, bethought himself of
going to the young Ladies, and told them the Gen∣tleman
that was wounded, desired the favour of
them to send a piece of green Silk and some Wax
to seal up a Letter. As they never could make
any Excuse to go into his Chamber, they were
overjoy'd at this that presented itself; thereupon
telling the <HI>Gascoin</HI> that they had none, while he
went and ask'd all the Family, they slipt up the
Garden Walls that their Mother might not see
them; and with a little work'd Box, in which
they kept gilt Paper, Ink, Sand, and pieces of
Silk of all Colours, came into <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Cham∣ber,
and had got to his Bed-side before their Fa∣ther,
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
whose Back was turn'd towards them, saw
them: when the sick Man, knowing them at first
sight, and getting up an end in Bed, cry'd out,
“Make room for the Princesses.” Upon which the
Baron thought him mad; but turning about, saw his
two Daughters. “These are <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Martho∣nida,
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id he,</HI> who are come to make you a Visit,
knowing that I was here.” “No, Sir, <HI>reply'd the
eld<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> st,</HI> one coming from you to tell us that this
young Stranger wanted a piece of green Silk, we
have brought it with us.” <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was so
confounded at so great a Favour, and agitated with
so many different Thoughts, that he was not able
to return any Answer; for thinking that it was a
Princess he was in love with, and finding that he had
descended some Steps lower, he thought that the
Letter, which he had writ in that Character, would
not be agreeable to a Country Lady, and had a
mortal Regret to lose all those Commendations she
was so deserving of: having pleased himself with
carrying on a gallant Intrigue, and having a Man
of Quality for his Confidant, not suspecting he was
the Father of his Mistress. But as he now disco∣ver'd
the Mystery, he laid aside his Despair, being
over-joy'd to find those charming Strangers again;
besides, their Readiness to come into his Chamber
flatter'd his Vanity and Heart so much, that he was
not able to open his Lips. When the Baron, who
never mistrusted when he writ the Letter, that it
was to his Daughters, soon eased him of his trou∣ble,
telling him with an Air of Gayety, that he
would not call <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida</HI>'s Merit in
question, since they were capable of making an
Impression on him; and desired they might not be
debarr'd the Pleasure of reading the most gallant
Billet-deux that had been writ for some Ages,
assuring him, that they wanted not a Taste of the
Beauries it contain'd. The Ladies for their parts
had no occasion for any Preparation to engage them
to fall into an Extasy; they were delighted so much
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
with the <HI>Optick Glass,</HI> that they cry'd out, How
beautiful and delicate is this Thought! how few
are there that can write in this manner? <HI>Dandi∣nardiere</HI>
was all the time adjusting his Night-cap,
ashamed to have his Head bound up; and catching
up his Cask which was in a Chair that stood by the
Bed-side, was for putting it on, as he said, to ap∣pear
more decent before the Ladies. The Baron at
this new piece of Extravagance could not help
laughing to himself, and let him try at an Impossibi∣lity,
for his Head was at that time half as big again
as his Cask; when finding he could not get it on,
he said, “Ladies, I hope you will accept of my re∣spectful
Intentions, but—” “Oh Sir, <HI>interrupted</HI>
Virginia, we take the Will for the Deed; but
lest we should incommode you, I think we ought
to retire.” “Ah glorious Suns! <HI>cry'd out the Cit,</HI>
would you darken my Chamber by your Eclipse?”
“Sir, <HI>said he, turning towards the Baron,</HI> oblige these
charming Goddesses to stay, I beseech you.” “No,
<HI>answer'd the Baron,</HI> I am vex'd that you have talk∣ed
so much as you have done; take a little Repose,
your Wounds are so great they ought to be taken
care of. Farewel, we will leave you; depend
upon it, Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> shall come no more; you shall
have another.”</P>
<P>Thus the Father and two Daughters took their
leaves of <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who desir'd he might not
be deny'd some Books, that he might divert the
Melancholy their Absence might create, by read∣ing.
“Oh, <HI>said</HI> Marthonida, I will send you a Sto∣ry
my Sister made an end of but last Nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.” “Oh,
<HI>said</HI> Virginia, it is one of those which are now so
much in vogue; and as I pretend to imitate Per∣sons
of Wit, tho' I live in the Country, yet I
design to send it to <HI>Paris:</HI> but if it has the hap∣piness
to please you, I shall be sure of the Appro∣bation
of the Learned.” “I give my Voice alrea∣dy,
adorable <HI>Virginia, reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, and
will send it to-morrow to Court, if you think
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
fit; where five or six Princesses give me the li∣berty
to write to them, and entertain them with
my Verses.” “Ha! What's that you say, Sir, <HI>cry'd</HI>
Marthonida, are you a Poet; if so, let us have
the pleasure of hearing some of your Perfor∣mances.”
“Oh, this is not a proper time, <HI>said the
Baron, pushing them out;</HI> with your good-wills you
would talk my Friend here to death.”</P>
<P>Being thus obliged to retire, as soon as they got
back to their Apartment, they sent their Knight-Errant
the Story by their Maid, who seem'd over∣joy'd
at these Marks of their Esteem; but as he
was not in a condition to read any long time, he
sent to tell the Prior that he wanted earnestly to
speak with him, which put the whole Family in
no small Alarm, every one being curious to know
the cause. When the Prior came, he ask'd him
what he would have: <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> shew'd him the
Story, and desired him to assuage his Pain by
reading it to him; which he began as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Story of the White Cat.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a King who had three Sons, all
handsome brave young Gentlemen; but jea∣lous
that they should desire to reign before his Death,
he caused several Reports to be spread abroad, that
they endeavoured to procure themselves, Creatures
to deprive him of his Crown. The King found
himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery old, but his Sense and Capacity of
Government no ways decay'd; so that he cared
not to resign up a Place he fill'd so worthily, and
thought that the best way for him to live at quiet
was to amuse them by Promises. To this end he
took them into his Closet, where after he had
talk'd to them with great Candour, he said,
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
“You will agree with me, my Children, that my
great Age will not allow me to apply myself to
the Affairs of the Publick with as much Care as
formerly; and I am afraid my Subjects will not
be so well pleased with my Administration: there∣fore
I intend to resign my Crown to one of you.
But as it is very just that you should strive to
please me for such a Present, and as I design to
retire into the Country; I should be very glad to
have a very pretty little Dog to keep me compa∣ny:
therefore without having more regard to my
eldest than my youngest, I declare to you, that
which of you brings me the most beautiful Dog
shall be my Heir.”</P>
<P>The three Princes were very much surprized at
their Father's Desire for a little Dog: for the two
younger, they were extraordinary well pleased at
this Proposal; and for the elder, he was either
too timorous or respectful to represent his Rights.
However they took their leaves of the King, who
gave them Money and Jewels, telling them that
they must all return without fail in a Year's time,
on a certain day, with their Dogs. But before
they set out on this Search, they all went to a
Castle three Leagues off, where they made an En∣tertainment,
and invited their most trusty Friends
and Confidants, before whom the three Brothers
swore an eternal Friendship to one another, pro∣mising
never to be jealous of each other's good∣fortune;
but that the most successful should let
the other two partake with him, appointing that
Castle for the Place of their Rendevouz, and from
thence to go all together to the King.</P>
<P>They every one took a different Road without
any Attendants; and for the two eldest they had
a great many Adventures: but as the Particulars
are not so well known by me, I shall pass them
over in silence, and speak only of the youngest,
who was a Prince of a sweet Behaviour, exact
Shape, fine Features, had delicate Teeth, perfor∣med
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
all Exercises fit for a Prince with a good
grace; and to sum up all in one, was a Youth of
bright parts, and brave even to a fault: besides, he
sang very agreeably, and play'd on the Lute and
Theorbo to admiration, and painted with great
Judgment. Not a day pass'd over his head, but
he bought Dogs of some kind or other, as Hounds,
Greyhounds, Spaniels, <HI>&amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> that were pretty, keeping
always the most beautiful, and letting the others
go; for it was impossible for him to keep all the
Dogs he purchas'd, since he had neither Gentle∣man,
Page, or any other Person along with him:
however he kept going on, without fixing on any
certain place; when he was surpriz'd one Night in
a large Forest where he could find no Shelter, by
a Storm of Thunder, Lightning, and Rain. Still
he pursu'd the Road, and went a long way, when
seeing a small Light, he persuaded himself some
House was nigh where he might get a Lodging
that Night; following the Light, he arriv'd at the
Gates of a stately Castle, which were all of massy
Gold; in which were Carbuncles which gave that ex∣traordinary
Light which the Prince saw so far off.
The Walls were of fine China, whereon the Hi∣stories
of all the Fairies since the Creation of the
World were represented; but the Rain and ill
Weather would not suffer our Prince to stay to
examine them all, tho he was charm'd to find the
Adventures of Prince <HI>Lutin,</HI> who was his Uncle,
among the rest.</P>
<P>He return'd to the Door, after having rambled
some Paces off, and there found a Deer's Foot at
the end of a Chain of Diamonds, which made him
admire the Magnificence: he pulled, and soon
heard a Bell, which by the Sound he judged to
be either Gold or Silver; and some time after the
Door open'd, and he saw no Person, but only
twelve Hands, each holding a Flambeau, at which
sight he was very much surpriz'd, and was in dis∣pute
whether or no he should proceed any further,
<PB N="255" REF="264"/>
when to his great Amazement he felt some others
behind him which push'd him forwards; where∣upon
he advanced with his Hand on his Sword,
tho very uneasy, and as he thought in some danger:
when going into a Wardrobe of Prophiry and Lapis
Lazuli, he heard two sweet Voices sing these words;
<Q><L>With Unconcern behold these Hands,</L>
<L>And dread no false Alarms,</L>
<L>If you are sure you can withstand</L>
<L>The Force of Beauty's Charms.</L></Q></P>
<P>He could not believe he was invited so kindly
to suffer any Injury; which made him, finding
himself forced forwards, to go to a great Gate of
Coral, which open'd as soon as he approach'd it, and
he went into a Hall of Mother of Pearl, and thence
into several Chambers adorn'd and inrich'd with
Paintings and Jewels; a vast number of Lights that
were let down from the Ceiling of the Hall, contri∣buted
to light some part of the other Apartments,
which besides were hung round with Glass Scon∣ces.
In short, the Magnificence was almost incre∣dible.
After having gone into sixty Chambers▪ the
Hands that conducted him spot him, and he saw a
great Easy Chair make up towards him; the Fire∣light
of itself, and the Hands, which were both
white and finely proportion'd, undress'd him, he
being wet and in some danger of catching cold.
A fine Shirt, and a Night-gown of Gold Brocade,
with Cyphers and small Emeralds, were given
him, and a Table and Toilet brought by these
Hands. Every thing was very grand: the Hands
comb'd out his Hair with a lightness that gave
him pleasure, and afterwards dress'd him in extra∣ordinary
fine Clothes, while he not only silently
admired at them, but at last began to be in some
little fright. When he was dress'd, that he seem∣ed
as beautiful as <HI>Adonis,</HI> they conducted him into
a stately Hall richly furnish'd, where he saw in
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
fine Painting, the Stories of the most famous Cats;
as <HI>Rodillardus</HI> hung by the Heels in a Council of
Rats, the Cat in Boots, the Marquiss <HI>de Carabas,</HI>
the writing Cat, the Cat turn'd Woman, Witches
in the Shapes of Cats, with their nightly Meetings,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all very odd and singular.</P>
<P>Two Cloths were laid, both garnish'd with gold
Plate, with Beaufets<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> set out with vast number of
Glasses, and Cups made of valuable Stones; and
while the Prince was thinking with himself what
they were laid for, he saw some Cats come and
place themselves upon a Bench set there for that
purpose, one holding a Musick-Book, another with
a Roll of Paper to beat time with, and the rest
with small Guittars: when all on a sudden they
every one set up a mewing in different Tones, and
struck the Strings with their Talons, which made
the strangest Musick that ever was heard. The
Prince would have thought himself in Hell, if the
Palace had not been so wonderful fine, it put him
so much in mind of it; then stopping his Ears, he
laughed heartily at the several Postures and Grima∣ces
of these strange Musicians. And while he was
calling to mind the several things that had hap∣pen'd
since his being in this Castle, he saw a little
Figure about half a yard high come forward in a
Veil of black Crape, led by two Cats in mourning
Clokes, with Swords by their sides, and follow'd
by a numerous Train of Cats; some carrying Rats,
and some Mice in Traps and Cages.</P>
<P>The Prince was in the greatest Amazement, and
knew not what to think; when the little Figure in
black coming up to him, and lifting up its Veil, he
saw the prettiest little White Cat he ever had set his
Eyes on, which seem'd to be young, but with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l
very melancholy, and set up such an agreeable and
charming Mewing, as went to the Prince's heart.
“Prince, <HI>said she,</HI> you are welcome, it is a pleasure
to me to see you here.” “Madam Puss, <HI>reply'd the
Prince,</HI> you are very generous to receive me so
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
graciously; but you appear to me to be a Cat of
extraodinary Merit: for the Gift you enjoy of
Speech, and this stately Castle you possess, are
convincing Proofs of it.” “Prince, <HI>answer'd the White
Cat,</HI> I desire you would forbear your Compli∣ments,
for I am both plain in my Discourse and
Manners, but have a good heart. Let us go, <HI>said
she,</HI> to Supper, and bid the Musicians leave off,
for the Prince does not understand what they say.”
“What, <HI>said he,</HI> do they then say any thing?” “Yes,
<HI>answer'd the White Cat,</HI> we have Poets, and
great Wits; and if you will stay with us, you
shall be convinced of it.” “I need but hear you
speak to believe that, <HI>answer'd he gallantly,</HI> for I
look on you as on something more than common.”</P>
<P>Supper was brought up, the Hands set on the Ta∣ble
two Dishes of Soup, one made of young Pid∣geons,
and the other of fat Mice. The sight of
the one hinder'd the Prince from eating of the
other, fancying that the same Cook had dressed
both; which the White Cat guessing at, assured
him that she had two Kitchens, and that he might
eat of whatever was set before him, and be con∣fident
there were no Rats or Mice in any thing of∣fer'd
him. The Prince, who believed that this
beautiful Cat would not deceive him, wanted not
to be told so twice. He observed a little Picture
to hang upon her foot, at which he was not a lit∣tle
surprized, and asked her to shew it him, think∣ing
it might be some fine Puss, a Lover of the
White Cat; but was in amaze to see an handsome
young Man, who resembled him very much. The
White Cat sigh'd, and growing melancholy, kept a
profound silence. The Prince perceiv'd that there
was something extraordinary, in it, but durst not
inform himself, for fear of displeasing or grieving
his kind Entertainer. He diverted her with all
the News he knew, and found her very well ac∣quainted
with the different Interest of Princes, and
other things that pass'd in the World. When Sup∣per
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
was done, the White Cat carried her Guest in∣to
a Hall, where there was a Stage, on which
twelve Cats, and as many Apes, danced a Mask in
<HI>Moor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Habits; and when this was over,
the White Cat bid her Guest good-night, and the
Hands led him into an Apartment opposite to that
he had seen, but no less magnificent: it was hung
with Tapestry, made of the Wings of Butterflies,
the Variety of which Colours form'd most beauti∣ful
Flowers. The Bed was of fine Gawze, tied
with Bunches of Ribbon, and the Glasses reach'd
from the Ceiling down to the Floor, and the Pan∣nels
between represented, in carved Work, thou∣sands
of <HI>Cupids.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince went to bed, and slept a little, but
was awaken'd again by a confused Noise. The
Hands took him out of bed, and put him on an
hunting Habit. He look'd out of the Window,
and saw above five hundred Cats, some leading
Greyhounds, and others blowing Horns; it being
that day a great Feast, whereon the White Cat had
a mind to go a hunting, and was willing that the
Prince should partake of that Diversion. The
Hands presented to him a wooden Horse, that had
a good speed and easy paces, which he made some
scruple to mount, alledging, that certainly they
took him for a Don <HI>Quixote;</HI> but his Refusal signified
nothing, they set him on the wooden Horse, which
was finely caparison'd, with a Saddle and Housing
of Gold, beset with Diamonds. The White Cat
rid on a most beautiful Ape, having thrown off her
Veil, and put on a Hat and Feather, which gave so
bold an Air, as frighten'd all the Mice that saw
her. Never was there better Sport; the Cats out∣ran
the Hares and Rabbits, and whenever they took
one, the White Cat always paunch'd its Prey, and
gave them their Fees. For the Birds, they were
not in much greater Security; the Cats climb'd up
the Trees, and the Ape carried the White Cat up
to the Eagles Nests. When the Chase was over,
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
she took a Horn, of about a finger's length, which,
when sounded, was so loud, that it might be heard
some Leagues; and as soon as she blow'd, she had
presently all the Cats in the Country about her,
some mounted in Chariots in the Air, and some in
Boats, but all in different Habits, which made a
fine Show. With this pompous Train she and the
Prince return'd to her Castle, who thought it fa∣vour'd
very much of Sorcery; but was more sur∣prized
at the Cat's speaking, than all the rest.</P>
<P>As soon as she came home, she put on her black
Veil again, and supped with the Prince, whom the
fresh Air had got a good Stomach; the Hands
brought him fine Liquors, which he not only drank
of with pleasure, but made him forget the little
Dog he was to procure for his Father: His Thoughts
were bent on bearing the White Cat company, and
he spent his time in Hunting and Fishing, and some∣times
in Balls and Plays. The White Cat made such
passionate Songs and Verses, that he began to think
she had a tender Heart, since she could not express
herself as she did, and be insensible of the Power
of Love; but her Secretary, who was an old Cat,
writ so bad an hand, that should any of her Works
remain, it would be impossible to read them. The
Prince had forgot his Country, the Hand still wait∣ed
on him, and he regretted his not being a Cat,
that he might pass his Life in such pleasant Com∣pany.
“Alas! <HI>said he to the White Cat,</HI> how sorry
am I to leave you, since I love you dearly: ei∣ther
become a Woman, or change me into a
Cat.” Which Wish the White Cat only answer'd
in obscure Words, tho she was mightily pleased
with it.</P>
<P>Thus a Year slipt away free from Care and Pain.
The White Cat knew the time he was to return,
and as he did not think of it, put him in mind
thereof. “Don't you know, <HI>said she,</HI> that you have
but three days to find a little Dog in, and that
your Brothers have got some very fine ones?”
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
This rouzed the Prince out of his Lethargy: “By
what secret Charm, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> have I forgot the
only thing in the World, that is of the greatest
importance to me? What will become of my Ho∣nour
and Fortune? Where shall I find a little
Dog beautiful enough to gain a Kingdom, and a
Horse swift enough to make diligent search after
one?” Then beginning to afflict himself, and
grow uneasy, the White C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> said to him, “Do not
grieve, Prince, I am your Friend; you may stay
here a day longer yet, for tho it is five hundred
Leagues off, the good wood<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Horse will carry you
there in less than twelve Hours.” “I thank you,
beautiful Cat, <HI>said he;</HI> but 'tis not enough for me
to return to my Father, I must carry with me a
little Dog.” “Here take this Acorn, <HI>said the White
Cat,</HI> it has a beautiful little Dog in it; put it to
your Far, and you will hear it bark.” The Prince
obey'd, heard it bark, and was transported with
Joy: He would have open'd it, so great was his
Curiosity; but the White Cat told him it might
catch cold, and he had better stay till he gave it
to his Father. He thank'd her a thousand times,
and bid her a tender Farewel, assuring her, that he
never pass'd his Days so pleasantly as with her,
and that he was grieved to leave her behind him;
adding, that tho she was a Sovereign, and had
great court paid to her, yet he could not forbear
asking her to go along with him: to which Propo∣sition
she only answer'd with a Sigh.</P>
<P>The Prince came first to the Castle, that was ap∣pointed
for the Rendevouz with his Brothers, who
arrived soon afterwards, but were very much sur∣prized
to see a wooden Horse in the Court, that
leapt better than any in all the Academies. The
Prince went to meet them, they embraced, and
gave each other an account of their Adventures;
but our Prince took care to conceal the truth of
his, and shew'd them only an ugly Turn-spit, tel∣ling
them that he thought him very pretty: at
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
which, tho they were very good Friends, the two
eldest conceived a secret Joy. The next day they
all three went together in the same Coach to the
King. The two eldest carried their Dogs in Bas∣kets
so white and delicate, that none durst hardly
touch them; and the youngest had his poor despi∣cable
Turn-spit in a String. When they came to
the Palace, the Courtiers crouded about them, to
welcome them home. The King, when they came
into his Apartment, knew not in whose favour to
declare, for the two little Dogs that the elder Bro∣thers
brought were almost of equal Beauty, when
the youngest pulling the Acorn out of his Pocket,
which the White Cat gave him, put an end to the
Difference. As soon as he open'd it, they all saw a
little Dog laid on Cotton, and so small, that he
might go thro a Ring and never touch it. The
Prince set it on the ground, and presently it began
to dance a Saraband with Castaners, as nimble and
as well as the best <HI>Spaniard.</HI> It was of a Mixture
of several Colours, its Ears and long Hairs reach'd
to the Ground. The King was very much sur∣prized,
and tho it was impossible to meet with any
thing so beautiful as <HI>Tonton,</HI> by which Name it was
call'd, yet he was not very ready to part with his
Crown, the least Gem of which was dearer to him
than all the Dogs in the World. He told his Chil∣dren,
that he was very well pleased with the pains
they had taken; but that they had succeeded so
well in the first thing he had desired, that he had
a mind to make further proof of their Abilities be∣fore
he perform'd his Promise: and that w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he
would give them a Year to find out a Web of
Cloth fine enough to go thro the Eye of a small
working Needle. They all stood surprized and
concerned, that they were to go ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in upon ano∣ther
Search; however, the two eld<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> seem'd the
more ready, and all three parted witho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t making
so great a Profession of Friendship as they did the
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
first time, for the Story of the Turn-spit had some∣what
abated it.</P>
<P>Our Prince mounted his wooden Horse again,
and without looking after any other Assistance, than
what he might expect from the Friendship of the
White Cat, return'd in all diligence to the Castle,
where he had been so well receiv'd; where he not
only found all the Doors open, but the Windows,
Walls, and Walks illuminated. The Hands came
and met him, held his Horse's Bridle, and led him
into the Stable, while the Prince went to the White
Cat's Chamber, who was laid in a little Basket, on
a Quilt of white Sattin. When she saw the Prince,
she made a thousand Skips and Jumps, to express
her Joy, and said, “Whatever reason I might have,
Prince, to hope for your Return, I must own I
durst not flatter myself with it; since I am gene∣rally
unhappy in what I most desire, therefore
this surprizes me.” The Prince, full of Acknow∣ledgment,
caress'd her often, and told her the Suc∣cess
he had in his Journey, which she was not
unacquainted with, and that the King required a
Web of Cloth so fine, as it might be drawn thro
the Eye of a Needle, which he believed was a
thing impossible; but that however he would not
fail to try to procure such a one, relying on her
Friendship and Assistance. The White Cat, put∣ting
on a grave Air, told him it was an Affair that
required some Consideration, that by Good-fortune
she had in her Castle some Cats that spun very
fine, that she would do what she could to forward
that Work, so that he might stay there, and not
trouble himself to search elsewhere, it being un∣likely
for him to meet with any so easily.</P>
<P>Soon after the Hands appear'd, carrying Flam∣beaux,
and the Prince follow'd the White Cat
into a magnificent Gallery, that look'd on to a Ri∣ver,
upon which there were some artificial Fire-works,
made to burn four Cats, who had been ac∣cused
and convicted of eating some Roast-meat de∣sign'd
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
for the White Cat's Supper, with some Cheese
and Milk; and besides, for conspiring against her
Person with <HI>Martafax</HI> and <HI>Lermites,</HI> two famous
Rats in that Country: but as it was thought that
there was a great deal of injustice done them, and
that most of the Witnesses were suborn'd, the
Prince obtain'd their Pardon; notwithstanding, the
Fire-works were let off, which gave the Prince
very great diversion. Afterwards a Repast was
served up, which gave the Prince more pleasure
than the Fire, for his Riding had got him an extra∣ordinary
Stomach: for the rest of the time, he spent
it in agreeable Entertainments, with which the in∣genious
White Cat diverted her Guest, who was
perhaps the first Mortal that was so well enter∣tain'd
by Cats, without any other Company. In∣deed
the White Cat had a ready Wit, and could
discourse on any Subject, which often put the
Prince into a great Consternation, and made him
say to her, “Certainly, all this that I observe so
wonderful in you, cannot be natural; therefore
tell me by what Prodigy you think and speak so
justly?” “Forbear asking me any Questions,
Prince, <HI>said she,</HI> for I am not allow'd to answer
them, but you may conjecture what you please;
let it suffice that I have used you with Respect,
and that I interest myself tenderly in what re∣gards
you.”</P>
<P>The second Year roll'd away insensibly, as well
as the first; the Prince wish'd for nothing, but the
diligent Hands brought it to him, whether Books,
Jewels, fine Pictures, or antique Medals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when
the White Cat, who was always watchful for the
Prince's Interest, inform'd him that the time of his
Departure drew nigh, but that he might be easy
concerning the Web of Cloth, for she had a won∣derful
fine one made; and added withal, that this
time she would give him an Equipage suitable to
his Birth, and without waiting for an Answer, ob∣liged
him to look into the great Court of the Ca∣stle,
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
in which there waited an open Chariot of
emboss'd Work in Gold, in several gallant Devices,
drawn by twelve milk-white Horses, four a-breast,
whose Harnesses were cover'd with Velvet of Fire-colour,
which was the same as the Lining of the
Chariot, beset with Diamonds, and the Buckles of
Gold. An hundred Coaches with eight Horses, full
of the Lords of his Retinue, magnificently clothed,
follow'd this Chariot, which was guarded besides
by a thousand Body-Guards, whose Clothing was
so full of Embroidery, that the Cloth was hardly
discover'd; and what was very singular, the White
Cat's Picture was seen every where, both in the
Devices on the Chariot, and on the Guards. “Go,
Prince, <HI>said she,</HI> and appear at the King your Fa∣ther's
Court in so stately a manner, that your
Magnificence may serve to impose on him, that
he may refuse you no longer the Crown you de∣serve.
Take this Walnut, be sure to crack it in
his presence, and you will find in it such a Web
as you want.” “Lovely White Cat, <HI>said he,</HI> I own
I am so penetrated with your Bounty, that if
you will give your consent, I will prefer passing
my days with you, before all the Grandeur I
may promise myself elsewhere.” “Prince, <HI>reply'd
she,</HI> I am persuaded of the Kindness of your Heart,
which is a rare thing among Princes, who would
be respected by all the World, and love none
but themselves; but you shew me this Rule is not
general. I make great account of the Attachment
you have for a little White Cat, that in the main
is fit for nothing but to catch Mice.” At that the
Prince kiss'd her Paw, and went away.</P>
<P>It is almost incredible to believe the haste he
made, were we unacquainted with the Swiftness
of the wooden Horse, who carried him before five
hundred thousand Leagues in less than two days;
and the same Power that animated him, had so great
an effect upon the others, that he was not above
four and twenty Hours upon the Road, and never
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
stopt till he arrived at the King's Palace, where
his two Brothers had got before him; who seeing
he was not come, rejoiced at his Negligence, and
said to one another, “How fortunate is this, he is
either sick or dead, and will not come to rival
us in this important business.” Thereupon they
pulled out their Webs, which were indeed very
fine, and pass'd them thro the Eye of a large Nee∣dle,
but not a small one; which Pretext of Refusal
the King embracing, went and fetch'd the Needle
he proposed, which the Magistrates, by his order,
had carried to the Treasury, and lock'd up care∣fully.
This Refusal raised a great Murmuring;
those that were Friends to the Princes, and parti∣cularly
the eldest, whose Web was the finest, said
it was all a Trick and Evasion: and the King's
Creatures maintain'd, that he was not obliged to
keep any other Conditions than what were propo∣sed;
when, to put an end to this Difference, there
was heard a Sounding of Trumpets and Hautboys,
which came before our Prince.</P>
<P>The King and his Sons were all surprized at this
Magnificence. The Prince, after he had respect∣fully
saluted his Father, and embraced his Bro∣thers,
took out of a Box cover'd with Rubies, a
Walnut, which he crack'd, thinking to find the
Web so much boasted of; but only saw a small Ha∣zel-Nut,
which he crack'd also, and, to his sur∣prize,
found only a Kernel of Wax. The King
and every body laugh'd to think, that the Prince
should be so credulous as to think to carry a Web
of Cloth in a Nut; but had they recollected them∣selves,
they might have remember'd the little Dog
that lay in an Acorn. However, he peal'd the
Kernel, and nothing appear'd but the Pulp itself,
whereupon a great noise was heard all over the
Room, every one having it in his mouth what a
fool the Prince was made of; who, for his part, re∣turn'd
no Answer to all the Pleasantries of the
Courtiers, but broke the Kernel, and found in it a
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
Corn of Wheat, and in that a Grain of Millet. At
the sight of this he began to distrust, and mutter'd
to himself, <HI>O White Cat, White Cat, thou hast deceived
me!</HI> And at that instant he felt a Cat's Paw upon his
Hand, which scratch'd him, and fetch'd Blood; he
knew not whether it was to encourage or dismay
him: however, he open'd the Millet-Seed, and to
the amazement of all present, drew out a Web of
Cloth four hundred Yards long; and what was
more wonderful, there were painted on it all sorts
of Birds, Beasts and Fish, Fruits, Trees and Plants,
Rocks, and all manner of rare Shells of the
Sea; the Sun, Moon, Stars and Planets; and all
the Pictures of all the Kings and Princes of the
World, with those of their Wives, Mistresses and
Children, all dress'd after the fashion of their own
Country. When the King saw this Piece of Cloth,
he turn'd as pale, as the Prince was red in looking so
long for it, and the Needle was brought, and it was
put thro five or six times; all which time the King
and his two Sons were silent, tho afterwards, the
Beauty and Rarity of the Cloth was so great, they
said it was not to be match'd in the whole World.
The King fetch'd a deep Sigh, and turning himself
towards his Children, said to them; “Nothing gives
me so much comfort in my old Age, as to be sen∣sible
of the Deference you have for me, which
makes me desirous of putting you to a new Tryal.
Go and travel another Year, and he that brings
me the most beautiful Damsel, shall marry her,
and be crown'd King; there being an absolute
Necessity that my Successor should marry: and I
swear and promise, I will no longer defer the
Reward.”</P>
<P>Our Prince suffer'd all this Injustice: The little
Dog and the Web of Cloth rather deserved ten
Crowns than one; but he was of so sweet a Dispo∣sition,
that he would not thwart his Father's Will:
so without any delay he got into his Chariot again,
and with his Train return'd to his dear White Cat,
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
who knowing the Day and Moment he would come,
had the Roads strew'd with Flowers. She was laid
on a <HI>Persian</HI> Tapestry, under a Canopy of Cloth of
Gold, in a Gallery from whence she could see him
return. He was receive'd by the Hands that always
served him, and all the Cats climbed upon the Gutter
to congratulate his Return by a Concert of mewing.
“Well, Prince, <HI>said she to him,</HI> I see you are come
back without your Crown.” “Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
by your Bounty I was in a condition of gaining
it, but I am persuaded the King is more loth to
part with it, than I am fond of having it.” “No
matter for that, <HI>said she,</HI> you must neglect nothing
to deserve it, I will assist you on this occasion;
and since you must carry a beautiful Damsel to
your Father's Court, I will look out for one, who
shall gain you the Prize: but in the interim, let
us be merry, and divert ourselves, I have order'd
a Sea-fight between my Cats and the most terri∣ble
Rats of the Country. My Cats perhaps may
be hard set, for they are afraid of the Water;
however, they will have advantage enough: we
cannot expect it in every thing.” The Prince re∣turn'd
her thanks, and said several handsome things
on her Conduct and Prudence. Aferwards they
went upon a Terrass which look'd on to the Sea.
The Cats Vessels consisted of great pieces of Cork,
on which they floated very commodiously; and those
of the Rats of Egg-shells joined together. The
Fight was very obstinate; the Rats threw them∣selves
into the Water, and swam better than the
Cats, insomuch that they as often conquer'd, as
they were conquer'd; when <HI>Minagrobis,</HI> the Admi∣ral
of the Cats, reduced the Rattish Race to the
utmost despair, by eating up the Admiral of their
Fleet, who was an old experienc'd Rat, that had
made three Voyages round the World in very good
Ships, in which he was neither Captain nor Sailor, but
only a kind of Interloper. But the White Cat was so
politick, that she would not absolutely destroy these
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
poor unfortunate Rats, thinking that if there were
no Rats nor Mice, her Subjects would live in an
Idleness that might become prejudicial to her.</P>
<P>The Prince pass'd this Year, as he had done the
two first, in Hunting, Fishing, and such Diversions,
and often at a Game of Chess, which the White
Cat play'd extraordinary well at; but he could not
forbear often questioning her, to know by what
Miracle she spoke. He ask'd her if she was a Fairy,
or if by any Metamorphosis she was turn'd into a
Cat. But as the White Cat was always capable of
saying what she had a mind to, she return'd him an
Answer so insignificant, that he perceiv'd she was
not willing to communicate this Secret to him.
As nothing passes away so quick as happy Days, if
the White Cat had not been so careful as to re∣member
the time the Prince was to return, 'tis cer∣tain
he would have quite forgot it. She told him
of it the night before, and withal, that the hour
of destroying the fatal Work of the Fairies was
come; and therefore he must resolve to cut off her
Head and Tail, and throw them presently into the
Fire. “What! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> shall I, my lovely White
Cat, be so barbarous as to kill you? You have
undoubtedly a mind to make proof of my Heart,
butbe assured it is incapable of wanting that
Friendship and Acknowledgment due to you.”
“No, Prince, <HI>continued she,</HI> I don't suspect you of
Ingratitude, I know your Merit; but neither you
nor I can prescribe to Fate: do what I desire
you, we shall hereby be happy; and you shall
know, upon the word of a Cat of Worth and Ho∣nour,
that I am really your Friend.” Tears stuck
two or three times in the young Prince's Eyes, to
think he must cut off the Head of his pretty Cat,
that had been so kind to him; he said all that he
could think most tender to engage her to dispense
with him: To which she answer'd obstinately, she
would die by his hand, and that was the only way
to hinder his Brother from having the Crown. In
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
short, she press'd him so earnestly, that he tremb∣ling,
with an unsteady hand, cut off her Head and
Tail, and threw them presently into the Fire; and
at the same time saw the most charming Metamor∣phosis
imaginable. The Body of the White Cat
grew presently large, and changed all on a sudden
to a fine Lady so accomplish'd, as exceeds descrip∣tion.
Her Eyes committed Theft upon all Hearts,
and her Sweetness kept them; her Shape was ma∣jestick,
her Air noble and modest, her Wit flow∣ing,
her Manners engaging; in a word, she was
beyond every thing that was lovely.</P>
<P>The Prince, at the sight of her, was in so agree∣able
a Surprize, that he thought himself inchanted.
He could not speak nor look at her, and his Tongue
was so tied, that he could not explain his Amaze∣ment;
which was much greater, when he saw an
extraordinary number of Gentlemen and Ladies,
holding their Cat-Skins over their Shoulders, come
and prostrate themselves at the Queen's feet, to
testify their Joy to see her again in her natural
State. She receiv'd them with all the Marks of
Bounty, which sufficiently discover'd the Sweet∣ness
of her Temper. After having spent some time
in hearing their Compliments, she order'd them to
retire, and leave her alone with the Prince; to
whom she spoke as follows:</P>
<P>Think not, Sir, that I have always been a Cat,
and that my Birth is obscure. My Father was King
of six Kingdoms, loved my Mother tenderly, and
gave her liberty to do what she pleased. Her most
prevailing Inclination was to travel, insomuch that
when she was with Child of me, she undertook to
go to see a Mountain, of which she had heard a
most surprizing account. As she was on the Road,
she was told there was nigh the Place she was
then at, an antient Castle of Fairies, which was the
finest in the World, or at least said to be so; for
as no Person was ever admitted into it, there could
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
not be any positive Judgment pass'd thereon: but
for the Gardens, they were known to contain the
best Fruits that ever were eat. The Queen my
Mother, who long'd to taste of them, went thither.
But when she came to the Gate of this stately Edi∣fice,
which shined again with Blue enamell'd with
Gold, nobody came, tho she knock'd a long time;
and her Desire increasing the more, by reason of
the Difficulty, she sent for Ladders to scale the
Walls: but they growing visibly to a great
height of themselves, they were forced to fasten
the Ladders to one another, to lengthen them, and
whenever any one went up them, they broke
under their Weight; so that they were either kil∣led
or lamed. The Queen was in the utmost de∣spair
to see Trees loaded with such delicious Fruits,
and not to taste of them; which she was resolved
to do, or die: insomuch that she order'd some rich
Tents to be pitch'd before the Castle, and stay'd
there six Weeks with all her Court. She neither
slept nor eat, but sigh'd continually, and was al∣ways
talking of the Fruit. In short, she fell dan∣gerously
ill, and no Remedy could be found out;
for the inexorable Fairies never appear'd from the
time she came there. All her Court were very
much grieved; there was nought to be heard but
Sighs and Lamentations, while the dying Queen
was continually asking those that were in waiting
upon her, for Fruit; but would eat of none but
what came out of this Garden.</P>
<P>One Night, after having got a little sleep, when
she awaken'd she saw a little ugly decrepid old
Woman sat in an Elbow-chair by her Bolster, and
was surprized that her Woman should suffer a
Stranger so near her; when she said to her, “We
think your Majesty very importunate to be so
stubborn in your Desires of eating of our Fruit;
but since your Life is in danger, my Sisters and I
have consented to give you as much as you can
carry away, and to let you eat of them as long
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
as you stay here, provided you will make us one
Present.” “Ah! my good Mother, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI>
name it, I will give you my Kingdoms, Heart
and Soul, to have some of the Fruit; I cannot
buy it too dear.” “We would have your Majesty,
<HI>said she,</HI> give us the Daughter you now bear in
your Womb. As soon as she is born, we will
come and fetch her; she shall be brought up by
us, and we will endow her with all Virtues,
Beauties, and Sciences: in short, she shall be our
Child, and we will make her happy: But your
Majesty must observe, that you must never see her
any more till she is married. If you will agree
to this Proposition, I will cure you immediately,
and carry you into our Orchards, where, not∣withstanding
'tis Night, you shall see well enough
to chuse what you would have; but if what I
say displeases your Majesty, Good-night.” “Tho
what you impose on me, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> is very
hard, yet I accept it rather than die; for cer∣tainly
if I cannot live, my Child must be lost;
therefore skilful Fairy, <HI>continued she,</HI> cure me, and let
me not be a moment debar'd of the Privileges I
am intitled to thereby.”</P>
<P>The Fairy touched her with a little golden Wand,
saying, “Your Majesty is free from all Illness.” And
thereupon she seem'd as if she had thrown off a
heavy Garment that had been very troublesome and
incommodious to her. She order'd all the Ladies
of her Court to be call'd, and with a gay Air told
them she was extraordinary well, and would rise,
since that the Gates of the Fairies Palace, which
were so strongly barrocaded, were set open for her
to eat of the Fruit, and to carry what she pleased
away. The Ladies thought the Queen delirious,
and that she was then dreaming of the Fruit she
long'd so much for; insomuch, that instead of re∣turning
any Answer they fell a crying, and call'd
in the Physicians; which Delays put the Queen
into the utmost despair: she ask'd for her Clothes,
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
and they refusing her them, put her into a violent
Passion, which they look'd upon as her Fever. In
the interim the Physicians came, who after having
felt her Pulse, and made their Enquiries, could
not deny but that she was in perfect Health. The
Ladies seeing the Fault they had committed thro
their great Zeal, endeavour'd to repair it by dres∣sing
her quickly. They every one begg'd her par∣don,
which she granted, and hasten'd to follow the
old Fairy who waited for her. She went into the
Palace, where nothing was wanting to make it
the finest in the World; which you will the more
easily believe, Sir, <HI>added the</HI> (new metamorphosed)
<HI>Queen,</HI> when I shall tell you 'twas this we are
now in. Two other Fairies not quite so old as she
that conducted my Mother, receiv'd her favourably
at the Gate; she desired them to carry her present∣ly
into the Garden, and to those Trees that bore
the best Fruits. They told her they were all
equally good, and that unless she would have the
pleasure of gathering them herself, they would call
them to her. “I beg, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> that I may
have the satisfaction of seeing so extraordinary an
Event.” Whereupon the elder of the three put
her Fingers in her Mouth, and blow'd three times,
and then cry'd, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectarines,
Plumbs, Cherries, Pears, Melons, Grapes, Apples,
Oranges, Lemons, Gooseberries, Currants, Straw∣berries,
Rasberries, come all at my Call. “But,
<HI>said the Queen,</HI> these Fruits are not all ripe in the
same Season.” “Oh, <HI>said they,</HI> in our Gardens we
have all sorts of Fruit always ripe and good, and
they never diminish.”</P>
<P>At the same time they came rolling to them
without any Bruises; and the Queen, who was im∣patient
to satisfy her longing, fell upon them, and
took the first that offer'd, which she rather de∣vour'd
than eat. When her Appetite was somewhat
satisfied, she desired the Fairies to let her go to
the Trees, and have the pleasure to gather them
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
herself: to which they gave their consents, but said
to her at the same time, You must remember the
Promise you have made us; for you will not be
allow'd to run back from it. “I am persuaded,
<HI>reply'd she,</HI> that it is so pleasant living with you,
and this Palace is so charming, that if I did not
love the King my Husband dearly, I would offer
myself; therefore you need not fear my retracting
from my word.” The Fairies, who were very
well satisfied, opened the Doors of their Gardens,
and all their Inclosures; and the Queen stay'd in
them three Days and Nights without ever stirring
out, so delicious she found them. She gather'd
Fruit for her Provision, and as they never waste,
loaded four hundred Mules she brought along with
her. The Fairies added to their Fruit, Baskets of
Gold of curious work to carry them in, and many
other very valuable Rarities. They promised to
educate and make me a compleat Princess, and to
chuse me out an Husband, and to inform my Mo∣ther
of the Wedding.</P>
<P>The King was overjoy'd at the Queen's return,
and all the Court express'd their pleasure to see
her again; there were nothing but Balls, Masque∣rades,
and Courses, where the Fruits the Queen
brought, serv'd for delicious Regales. The King
prefer'd them before all other Things, but knew
not the Bargain she had made with the Fairies, but
often asked her what Country she had been in, to
bring home such good things; to which she reply'd,
she found them on a Mountain that was almost in∣accessible;
sometimes that she met with them in a
Valley, and sometimes in the midst of a Garden or
a great Forest; all which Contradictions very
much surprized the King. He enquired of those
that went with her, but they were all forbid to
tell any thing of the matter. At length the Queen,
when her time was at hand, began to be troubled
at what she had promised the Fairies, and grew
very melancholy; she sigh'd every Minute, and
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
changed her Countenance. The King was very
much concern'd, and pressed the Queen to declare
what was the cause; who with some difficulty told
him what had passed between her and the Fairies,
and that she had promised them the Daughter she
was then big with. “What, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> we
have no Children, and could you who know how
much I desire them, for the eating of two or
three Apples, promise your Daughter? Certainly
you must have no regard for me.” And thereupon
he loaded her with a thousand Reproaches, which
made my poor Mother almost ready to die for
grief: But not content with this, he put her into
a Tower under a strong Guard, where she could
have no Conversation but with the Officers that
were appointed to attend her. The ill Correspon∣dence
between the King and Queen put the Court
into the utmost Consternation: they laid aside their
rich Clothes, and put on such as were agreeable
to the general Sorrow. The King appear'd for
his part inexorable, and wou'd not see the Queen;
but as soon as I was born made me be brought in∣to
his Palace to be nursed there, while my Mother
at the same time remain'd a Prisoner, and in an ill
state of Health. The Fairies, who were not igno∣rant
all this while of what past, and who look'd
upon me as their own Property, were so provoked,
that they resolved to have me; but before they had
recourse to their Art, they sent Ambassadors to the
King, to desire him to set the Queen at liberty,
and to restore her to his Favour again; and like∣wise
to demand me, that I might be nursed and
brought up by them. The Ambassadors were so
little and deformed, for they were Dwarfs, that
the King instead of granting what they ask'd, re∣fused
them rudely, and if they had not got away
quickly, might have served them worse.</P>
<P>When the Fairies were inform'd of my Father's
Proceeding, they were so enrag'd, that after they
had sent all the Plagues capable of rendring his
<PB N="175" REF="284"/>
six Kingdoms desolate, they let loose a terrible
Dragon that poison'd all the Places wherever he
came; devour'd Men, Women, and Children, and
kill'd all Trees and Plants with the breath of his
Nostrils. The King finding himself reduc'd to this
Extremity, consulted all the Sages of his Kingdom
to know what he should do to preserve his Subjects
against these Misfortunes, wherewith they were
so much oppress'd: They advised him to send for
the best Physicians to prescribe the most excellent
Remedies, as one means; and to pardon all Crimi∣nals
that were condemn'd to die, if they would
fight with the Dragon, as the other. The King,
who was well enough pleased with this Advice,
put it in execution, but received no benefit by it;
for the Mortality continued, and none fought with
the Dragon but were devour'd: insomuch, that at
last he had recourse to a Fairy who had protected
him from his Youth, and who was so old that she
hardly ever rose from off her Seat. He went to
her, and reproached her for permitting his Fate to
persecute him in such a manner without giving him
some Assistance. “What would you have me do,
<HI>reply'd the Fairy,</HI> you have provoked my Sisters,
who have equal Power with me, and we seldom
act one against another; therefore think of ap∣peasing
them by giving your Daughter, since they
have a Right to her; set the Queen at liberty,
who is too good and amiable to be used so ill, and
resolve to fulfil what she has promised, and then
I'll assure you, you shall be happy.” The King, my
Father, loved me dearly; but seeing no other way
to preserve his Kingdoms, and to be delivered from
the fatal Dragon, told his Friends that he would
believe her, and would give the Fairies his Daugh∣ter,
since she had assured him I should be taken
care of, and treated as became a Princess of my
Birth, and release the Queen; and withal desired
her to tell him how he might send me to the Fairy
“Castle,” “You must carry her, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> in a
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
Cradle to the Mountain of Flowers, and must stay
there-abouts to see what happens.” The King told
her, she might acquaint her Sisters that he and the
Queen would go with me there in eight days time,
and that they might do with me what they thought
proper.</P>
<P>As soon as he came back to the Palace, he sent
for the Queen with as much Love and Tenderness,
as he had made her a Prisoner with Anger and
Passion; but she was so fallen away and alter'd,
that he could hardly know her, if he had not
been very certain she was the Person he once so
much doated on. He begg'd of her, with Tears in
his Eyes, to forget the ill Treatment she had re∣ceiv'd
from him, which he promised her should be
the last. She answer'd, that she brought it upon
herself by her Imprudence, in promising her Child
to the Fairies; and that if any thing would plead
her excuse, it was the condition she was then in.
In short, he declared his design to her of putting
me into their hands, which she opposed, and it
seem'd as if it was my Fate to be always the cause
of my Father and Mother's disagreeing: But after
she had cry'd and taken-on some time, without
obtaining what she desired, (for my Father too
well foresaw the fatal Consequences, and his Sub∣jects
still dying as if they had been guilty of our
Faults) she consented, and Preparations were made
against the Ceremony. I was put into a Cradle of
Mother of Pearl, adorn'd as much as possible by
Art, with Garlands of Flowers and Festons hung
round about it, and the Flowers so intermixt with
Jewels of several Colours, that when the Sun re∣flected
upon them, they gave such a lustre as daz∣zled
the Eyes. The Magnificence of my Dress ex∣ceeded,
if that was possible, my Cradle. All the
Bands and Rolls of my Swadling-Clouts were
buckled with large Pearls, four and twenty▪ Prin∣cesses
of the Blood carried me on a kind of a light
Litter, all dress'd in white to resemble my Inno∣cence,
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
and were follow'd by the whole Court ac∣cording
to their Ranks. While they were going
up the Mountain, they heard a melodious Symphony;
and afterwards the Fairies appear'd to the number
of six and thirty, for the three had invited all their
Friends, each in a Shell of Pearl as large as that
wherein <HI>Venus</HI> arose out of the Sea, and drawn by
Sea-horses, in as great Pomp as if they had been
the first Queens in the World. They were exceed∣ing
old and ugly: they carry'd in their hands Olive-Branches,
to signify to the King, that by his Sub∣mission
he had gain'd their Favour. When they
took me, it was with such extraodinary Caresses,
that it seem'd as if they lived only to make me happy.</P>
<P>The Dragon, which was the Instrument of their
Revenge against my Father, follow'd them bound
in Chains of Diamonds. They took me in their
Arms, caress'd me a thousand times, endow'd me
with several Gifts, and then fell to dancing; and
'tis almost incredible to believe how these old Wo∣men
jump'd and skip'd. Afterwards the devouring
Dragon came forwards, the three Fairies to whom
my Mother promised me, placed themselves upon
him, and set my Cradle between them; then stri∣king
the Dragon with a Wand, he presently dis∣play'd
his large Wings, which were as thin and
fine as Gawze, and intermix'd with various Colours,
and carried them to their Castle. My Mother see∣ing
me in the Air upon this furious Dragon, could
not forbear shrieking out, while the King com∣forted
her by the assurance his Friend had given
him, that no ill Accident should befal me; and
that I should have as great care taken of me as if
I was in their own Palace: which assurance ap∣peased
her, tho she was very much grieved to lose
me for so long a time; especially when she reflec∣ted
that she herself was the cause of it. You must
know, Prince, <HI>continued she,</HI> that my Guardians built
a Tower on purpose for me, wherein there were a
thousand beautiful Apartments for all the Seasons
of the Year, furnish'd with magnficent Goods, and
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
agreeable Books; but there were no Doors, and no
other coming in but at the Windows, which were
prodigious high. It was surrounded by beautiful
Gardens full of Flowers, and embelish'd with Foun∣tains
and Arbours of Greens, where it was cool
and pleasant in the hottest Seasons. Here the Fai∣ries
brought me up, and took more care of me than
every they promised the Queen to do. My Clothes
were so fashionable and fine, that if any one had
seen me, they would have thought it had been
my Wedding-day. They taught me all that was
proper for one of my Age and Birth to learn, and
they had not much trouble with me, for there
was nothing but what I comprehended with great
ease. They were very well pleased at my ready
Disposition, and if I had never seen any body be∣sides
them, I should have been contented to have
lived there all my Life. They came very often to
see me, mounted upon the same dreadful Dragon I
have already spoke of; they never mentioned the
King or Queen to me, but call'd me their Daugh∣ter,
and I thought myself really so. No Creature
lived with me in this Tower but a Parrot and a
little Dog, which were endow'd both with Reason
and Speech, and were given to divert me.</P>
<P>One Side of the Tower was built upon a hollow
Road, ser full of Elms and other Trees, which
shaded it so much, that I never saw any one▪ pass
by while I was there; when one day, as I was at
the Window talking to my Parrot and Dog, I
heard a noise, and looking about, perceiv'd a young
Gentleman, who stopt to hear our Conversation.
I had never seen one before but in Paintings, and
was not sorry that this Accident had given me the
opportunity; insomuch, that not mistrusting the
danger we run in the Satisfaction we receive by
the sight of so lovely an Object, I look'd at him
again, and the more I look'd, the more pleased I
was. He made me a low Box, fix'd his Eyes on
me, and seem'd concern'd to know how to talk
to me; for my Window being a great height, he
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
was afraid of being heard, knowing that it was a
Castle which belong'd to Fairies. Night came upon
us all on a sudden, or, to speak more properly, be∣fore
we perceiv'd it; he sounded his Horn twice
or thrice, which he thought to please me with,
and then went away without my discovering which
way he took, it was so dark. I remain'd thought∣ful;
the Pleasure I used to take in talking to my
Parrot and Dog, was no ways agreeable. They
said all the pretty things that could be to me, for
these were very witty: but my Thoughts were
otherwise engaged, and I had not Art enough to
dissemble. My Parrot observed all my Actions, but
made no mention of what he thought. The next
Morning I rose with the Sun, and run to my Win∣dow,
where I was most agreeably surprized to see
my Spark, who was dress'd magnificently; in which
I flatter'd myself I had some share, and was not
mistaken. He spoke to me through a Speaking-Trumpet,
told me he had been till that instant in∣sensible
to all the Beauties he had beheld, but found
himself so sensibly touched with me, that he could
not live without seeing me. I was mightily pleas'd
with his Compliment, but vex'd that I durst not
make some Reply, for I must have bawled out with
all my might, and run the risque of being heard
sooner by the Fairies than him. I threw him some
Flowers I had in my hand, which he took for so
signal a Favour, that he kiss'd them several times,
and thank'd me. He ask'd me afterwards if I ap∣proved
of his coming every day at the same Hour
under my Window, and if I did, to throw some∣thing;
whereupon I presently pull'd off a Turquoise-Ring
that I had on my Finger, and cast it at him,
making a sign for him to be gone presently, be∣cause
I heard the Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> coming on the
Dragon to bring me my Breakfast.</P>
<P>The first Words she spoke, when she enter'd my
Chamber, were; “I smell the Voice of a Man,
search, Dragon.” Alas! what a condition was I
in! I was ready to die with fear, lest he should
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
find out, and follow my Lover. “Indeed, <HI>said I,</HI>
my good Mamma, (for the Fairy would be called
so) you banter, when you say you smell the Voice
of a Man; can any one smell a Voice? and should
it be so, what Wretch could be so bold as to
venture coming up into this Tower?” “What you
say, is very true, Child, <HI>said she,</HI> I am overjoy'd to
hear you argue so well, I fancy 'tis the Hatred I
have against Men, that makes me think them nigh
when they are not; however, I have brought you
your Breakfast and a Distaff, be sure spin, yesterday
you did nothing, and my Sisters are very angry.”
Upon my word, I was so taken up with this Stranger,
that I was not able to work. As soon as her back
was turn'd, I threw away my Distaff, and went upon
the Terrass, to look as far as my Eye would carry,
in an excellent Spying-Glass I had; by which, after
having look'd about some time, I discover'd my Lo∣ver
laid under a rich Pavillion of Cloth of Gold,
on the top of a high Mountain, surrounded by a
numerous Court. I doubted not but that he was
some neighbouring King's Son, and was afraid, lest
when he came to the Tower again, he should be
found out by the terrible Dragon; I went and
fetch'd my Parrot, and bid him fly to that Moun∣tain,
to desire him from me not to come again, be∣cause
I was afraid my Guardian should discover it,
and he should come into danger. My Parrot ac∣quitted
himself of his Commission, and surprized
all the Courtiers, to see him come upon full wing,
and perch upon the Prince's Shoulder, and whisper
him softly in the Ear. The Prince was both over∣joy'd
and troubled at this Message. My Care flat∣ter'd
his Passion, but the difficulty there was in
speaking to me, gave him as much Chagrin. He
ask'd the Parrot a thousand Questions, and the
Parrot him as many, for he was naturally inquisi∣tive.
The Prince, in return for my Turquoize,
sent me a Ring of another, but much finer than
mine, cut in the shape of a Heart, and set round
with Diamonds; and told him, (that he might treat
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
him more like an Ambassador) he would present
him with his Picture, which he might shew to his
charming Mistress: the Picture was tied under his
Wings, and the Ring he brought in his Bill.</P>
<P>I waited for the Return of my green Courier,
with an Impatience unknown to me till then. He
told me the Person I sent him to was a great King,
who had receiv'd him with all the Joy possible,
that I might assure myself he lived only for me;
and that tho it was very dangerous for him to
come so low as my Tower, yet he was resolved to
hazard all to see me. This News had such an ef∣fect
upon me, that I fell a crying; my Parrot and
Dog comforted me the best they could, for they
loved me tenderly, and then my Parrot deliver'd
the Prince's Ring to me, and shew'd me his Pic∣ture.
I must own I was overjoy'd, that I could
view so nigh a Person I had never seen, but at a
distance. He appear'd much more lovely than he
seem'd, and the different Thoughts this sight in∣spir'd
me with, for some were agreeable to me,
and others not, made me very uneasy; which the
Fairies, when they came to see me, discover'd:
they said one to another, that I was certainly trou∣bled
at something, and that they must think of pro∣viding
a Husband for me of the Fairy Race. They
named several, but at last pitch'd on the little King
<HI>Migonnet,</HI> whose Kingdom lay above five hundred
Leagues off from their Palace, but that was of no
great importance. My Parrot heard all their Dis∣course,
and came to give me an account. “Alas!
my dear Mistress, <HI>said my Bird,</HI> how much I pity
you, if you should be King <HI>Migonnet</HI>'s Queen!
He is enough to fright you, which I am sorry to
tell you; but one thing I am sure of, the King who
loves you, scorns to have such a one for his Foot∣boy:
and I think, <HI>continued he,</HI> if I am not much
mistaken, I have perch'd upon the same Bough
with him.” “How do you mean, <HI>reply'd I,</HI> on the
same Bough?” “Why, <HI>said he,</HI> he has Feet like
an Eagle.” I was very much afflicted at this ac∣count,
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
I look'd on the charming Picture of the
young King, and fancy'd he only gave it my Par∣rot,
that I might have an opportunity of seeing it;
but when I compared it with <HI>Migonnet,</HI> I lost all
hopes of Life, and resolved to die, sooner than
marry him. I slept not all the night, but talked
with my Parrot and Dog, and towards morning
began to close my Eyes. My Dog, who had a good
Nose, smelt the King at the foot of the Tower;
he awaken'd the Parrot, and said to him, “I'll en∣gage
the King is below.” To which the Parrot
made answer, “Hold thy tongue, thou prating Fool,
because thy Eyes and Ears are always open, you
are vex'd that any body else should have any rest.”
“Well, <HI>said the Dog,</HI> I am sure he is:” “And, <HI>reply'd
the Parrot,</HI> I am sure he is not; for I have, from
my Mistress, forbid him from coming.” “You talk
finely of your forbidding him, <HI>cry'd the Dog;</HI> a Man
in Love consults nothing but his Passion.” There∣upon
pulling the Parrot by the Tail, he made such
a noise, that I awoke. They told me of their Dis∣pute;
I ran, or rather flew to the Window, whence
I saw the King holding out his Arms, who, by his
Trumpet, told me he could not live without me,
that he possess'd a flourishing Kingdom, and con∣jured
me to find out some way to escape from my
Tower, or to let him to come to me, calling Hea∣ven,
and all the Elements, to witness that he
would marry me, and make me his Queen. I bid
my Parrot go and tell him, that what he desir'd
seem'd to me almost impossible; that however, up∣on
the Word he had given, and Oaths he had swore
to me, I would endeavour to accomplish his De∣sires:
but withal, to conjure him not to come every
day, lest he should be discover'd, which might
prove fatal to us both.</P>
<P>He went away, overjoy'd with the flattering
hopes I gave him. I found myself in the utmost
Confusion, when I reflected on what I had pro∣mised.
I knew not how one so young, timorous,
and unexperienced, should get out of a Tower, to
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
which there were no Doors, with the assistance on∣ly
of a Dog and a Parrot; therefore I resolved not
to attempt a thing in which I could never succeed,
and so sent my Parrot to acquaint the King with it:
who was for killing himself that minute, but at
last charged the Parrot to persuade me to it, and
to come and see him die, or bring him some Com∣fort.
To which my winged Ambassador answer'd,
that he was very well persuaded his Mistress only
wanted the Power. When he gave me an account
of what had happen'd, I was more grieved than
ever. The Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> came, and found my Eyes
swell'd and red; she told me I had been crying,
and if I did not tell her the reason, she would
burn me. I answer'd trembling, I was weary with
spinning, and that I had a great desire to make
some Nets to catch some Birds, that destroy'd the
Fruit in the Garden. “What you desire, Child,
<HI>said she,</HI> shall cost you no more Tears, I will bring
you Materials enough to-night; but I would ra∣ther
you thought less of working, and more of
setting off your Beauty, because King <HI>Migonnet</HI>
will be here in a few days.” I sigh'd at this News,
but made no Reply; but as soon as her back was
turn'd, began two or three Rows of my Nets, and
afterwards apply'd myself to the making of a Lad∣der
of Ropes. But as the Fairy had not furnish'd
me with as much as I wanted, which obliged me
to ask for more, she told me my Work was like
<HI>Penelope</HI>'s Web, it went not forwards, and yet I
teazed her for more Stuff. “O good Mamma! <HI>said
I,</HI> you may say what you please; but you must
know, that as I am not very ready at this Work,
I burn it when it does not please me.” With
which Excuse she seem'd satisfy'd, and left me.</P>
<P>I sent my Parrot that night to bid the King come
under my Window, where he should find a Ladder,
and to tell him he should know more when he
came; in short, I had tied it very fast, and was de∣termin'd
to escape with him by this means: but
he, as soon as he saw it, without waiting for my

coming down, mounted up in haste, and threw
himself into my Chamber, as I was making every
thing ready for my Flight. I was so overjoy'd to
see him, that I forgot the Danger we were in. He
renew'd all his Oaths, and intreated me to defer
his Happiness no longer; we made my Parrot and
Dog the Witnesses to our Marriage, which was the
most private in the world for Persons of our Rank,
and none certainly were ever better satisfied. The
King left me before day; I told him of the Fairies
design to marry me to <HI>Migonnet,</HI> and gave him a de∣scription
of his mean and sorry Figure, for which
his Horror was as great as mine. As soon as he
was gone, the Hours seem'd like Years, I ran to
the Window, and follow'd him with my Eyes, not∣withstanding
the Darkness: But how great was my
Surprize, to see a fiery Chariot, drawn in the Air
by six winged Salamanders, which flew so swift,
that the Eye was not able to follow them. This
Chariot was attended by a great many Guards, all
mounted on Ostriches. I did not give myself time
to think, that it was <HI>Migonnet</HI> that was thus traver∣sing
the Air, but I believed it was a Fairy or In∣chanter.
Soon after, the Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> came into my
Chamber, and told me she brought me good News,
that my Lover would be with me presently, and
bid me prepare myself to receive him; and with
that gave me fine Clothes and Jewels. “But pray,
<HI>said I,</HI> who has inform'd you that I want to be
married? I am sure 'tis the farthest from my
Thoughts; therefore send King <HI>Migonnet</HI> back a∣gain,
for I won't put in one Pin more, whether
he think me handsome or not, I am not for him.”
“Oh, oh! <HI>said the Fairy again,</HI> little Rebel, little
Empty-Pate, I shall not mind your Raillery, but I
shall—” “What will you do? <HI>reply'd I, enrag'd
at the Names she had call'd me:</HI> Can any one be
worse served than I am, to live all my Days im∣mur'd
with a Parrot and a Dog, and to be visited
constantly by that frightful Dragon?” “Ha! In∣grate!
<HI>said the Fairy,</HI> is this all we deserve for our
<PB N="285" REF="296"/>
Care and Pains? I have told my Sisters but too
often, we should have but sorry Recompence.” At
that she went away, and told them of our Diffe∣rence,
which put them into no little Amazement.</P>
<P>My Parrot and Dog remonstrated to me, that if
I should continue any longer thus sturdy, they fore∣saw
that I should undergo some Misfortune. But
I was so proud of possessing the Heart of a King,
that I despised both the Fairies, and the Advice of
those my little Companions. I would not dress me,
but strove all I could to tumble my Head-dress, that
I might appear less agreeable to <HI>Migonnet.</HI> We had
an Interview upon the Terrass, he came in his
fiery Chariot; but of all Dwarfs, he was the least
I ever saw in my life. His Feet were like an Ea∣gle's,
and close to his Knees, for Legs he had none.
His Royal Garment was not above half a Yard long,
and trail'd one third part upon the Ground. His
Head was as big as a Peck, and his Nose long e∣nough
for twelve Birds to perch on it, and be re∣galed
at the same time with a delightful Bush, for
his Beard was large enough for Canary-Birds to
build their Nests in: And for his Ears, they reach'd
a foot above his Head, but were a great part hid
by a high Crown that he wore, to appear the more
grand. The Flame of his Chariot coddled the
Fruit, withered the Flowers, and dryed up the
Fountains of my Gardens. He came with open
Arms to embrace me, and I stood upright, which
obliged his first Esquire to hold him up; as soon as
he came near me, I ran to my Chamber, and fa∣sten'd
my Window: so that <HI>Migonnet</HI> enraged, was
forced to retire to the Fairies, who ask'd a thou∣sand
pardons for the Affront; and to appease him,
because he was powerful, they resolved to bring
him at night into my Chamber, and while I was
asleep, to tie my hands and feet, and put me into
his Chariot. Things being thus agreed on, they
only chided me for what I had done, and char∣ged
me to think of making him amends for the
future. Which Mildness of their surprized my
<PB N="286" REF="297"/>
Parrot and Dog, who told me their Hearts misgave
them, for they knew the Fairies to be strange ill-temper'd
sort of old Ladies, and especially <HI>Violenta.</HI>
I laugh'd at their Fears, and waited with the ut∣most
impatience for my dear Husband, whose De∣sires
to see me again were no less violent; I threw
out the Ladder of Ropes, resolving to escape with
him, he came softly up it, and said a thousand kind
things, which I dare not recall to my remembrance.</P>
<P>While we were talking together, with the same
tranquillity as if we had been in his own Palace,
we saw all on a sudden the Windows broke open,
and the Fairies enter upon their frightful Dragon,
follow'd by <HI>Migonnet</HI> in his fiery Chariot, and all
his Guards on Ostriches. The King, without any
dismay, clapt his Hand on his Sword, and thought
of securing and protecting me; when these barba∣rous
Creatures set their Dragon upon him, which
devoured him before my face. Vex'd and in de∣spair,
I threw myself into the mouth of this dread∣ful
Monster, that he might swallow me as he had
done the Prince, who was dearer to me than all
the World besides. And I had certainly undergone
the same Fate, but the Fairies, who were more cruel
than the Monster, would not permit it, but said I
must be reserved for greater Punishments; a quick
Death was too mild a one for so base a Creature:
whereupon touching me, I found myself changed
into a white Cat. They conducted me to this
stately Palace, which belonged to my Father, and
turned all the Lords and Ladies into Cats; and for
the rest of his Subjects, left of them only the Hands,
which we see, and reduced me to that miserable
Condition you found me: letting me know at the
same time my Birth, the Death of my Father and
Mother, and that I never should be released from this
Metamorphosis, but by a Prince that perfectly re∣sembled
my Husband, whom they deprived me of.
“You, Sir, have that resemblance, the same Fea∣tures,
Air and Voice; I was struck as soon as I
saw you, and was inform'd of all that should hap∣pen
<PB N="287" REF="298"/>
and am still of all that shall come to pass:
my Pains will be at an end.” “And shall mine,
fair Queen, <HI>said the Prince,</HI> be of long duration?”
“I love you, Sir, already more than my Life, <HI>said
the Queen;</HI> we must go to your Father, and know
his Sentiments for me, and whether he will con∣sent
to what you desire.” After this she went
out, the Prince handed her into a Chariot, which
was much more magnificent than that he had, and
then went into it himself. All the rest of the E∣quipage
answer'd it so well, that the Buckles of
the Horses Harnesses were Diamonds and Emeralds.
I shall say nothing of their Conversation, which
must be very polite, since she was not only a great
Beauty, but also a great Wit; and for the Prince,
he was no ways inferior to her therein: so that all
their Thoughts were bright and lively.</P>
<P>When they came nigh the Castle where the Bro∣thers
were to meet, the Queen went into a Cage
of Chrystal set in Gold, which had Curtains drawn
about it, that she might not be seen, and was car∣ried
by handsome young Men richly clothed. The
Prince staid in the Chariot, and saw his Brothers
walking with two Princesses of extraordinary
Beauty. As soon as they knew him, they came to
receive him, and ask'd him if he had brought a
Mistress along with him; to which he answer'd,
that he had been so unfortunate in all his Journey,
to meet with none, but what were very ugly, but
that he had brought a pretty white Cat. “A Cat,
<HI>said they, laughing;</HI> what was you afraid that Mice
should devour our Palace?” The Prince reply'd,
that he was not very wise in making such a Pre∣sent
to his Father, but it was the greatest Rarity
he could meet with. Afterwards they all bent
their Course towards the capital Town. The two
elder Princes and their Princesses went in Calashes
of blue emboss'd with Gold, with Plumes of white
Feathers upon the Horses Heads; nothing was finer
than this Cavalcade. The younger Prince follow'd
after, and then the Cage of Chrystal, which every
<PB N="288" REF="299" MS="y"/>
body admired. The Courtiers crouded to tell the
King that the Princes were arrived, and brought
most beautiful Ladies along with them; which
News was no ways pleasing to the King. The two
elder Princes were very earnest to shew him the
Beauties they had brought, whom he receiv'd kind∣ly,
but knew not in whose favour to decide; when
looking on the youngest, “What, <HI>said he,</HI> are you
come by yourself?” “Your Majesty, <HI>reply'd the
Prince,</HI> will find in this Cage a pretty little Cat,
which mews and plays so sweetly, that you will
be very well pleased with her.” Hereat the King
smiled, and was going to open the Cage; but as
soon as he approach'd towards it, the Queen with
a Spring broke it in pieces, and appear'd like the
Sun when he breaks forth from a Cloud. Her fair
Hair was spread upon her Shoulders, and laid in
fine large Rings, and her Forehead was adorn'd
with Flowers. Her Gown was a thin white Gawze,
lin'd with a rose-colour'd Taffety. She made the
King a low Courtesy, who in the Excess of his
Admiration could not forbear crying out, “This is
the incomparable Fairy who deserves my Crown.”
“Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> I came not to rob you of your
Crown, which you wear so worthily; I was born
Heiress to six Kingdoms, give me leave to present
one of them to you, and one to either of your
Sons, for which I ask no other Return but your
Friendship, and this young Prince in Marriage:
three Kingdoms will be enough for us.” The
King and all the Court were not able to express
their Joy and Amazement. The Marriages of the
three Princes and their Princesses were celebrated
at the same time, and the Court spent several
Months in Pleasures and Diversions; after which,
they all went to their Dominions, and the White
Cat gain'd as great Honour by her Bounty and Ge∣nerosity,
as by her rare Merit and Beauty.</P>
