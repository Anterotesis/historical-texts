I see Mists crowning distant Mountains, and march∣ing
to shock and engage each other, flaming Meterors
dart this Way, rise, fall, shoot and flash; direct,
oblique, prone, perpend, and pointing to each other:
Moving Air describes in (to others invisible) small and
exactly shap'd Clouds, the very Faces, Shapes, Names
and Distinctions of such Persons, Nations, Towns,
Cities and People of whom those Mists, Meteors,
and other Clouds represent the Actions: Darkness it
self forms the Posture of things by which <HI>WE</HI> see,
and every Cloud is fill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with Hieroglyphicks for
the Assistance of this uncouth Attainment called
<HI>SECOND SIGHT.</HI></P>
<P>In this Manner Peace, War, Life, Death, Fate,
Catastrophe, Plague, Dearth, Plenty, Victory, Loss,
Storms, Blasts, Tempests, and universal Event is
more easily seen by <HI>Ʋ S,</HI> than any Calculation from
Views of Stars, Constellations, Motions or Positi∣ons
of Heavenly Bodies can discern: As these Views
have signified then in my Observe for the Year co∣ming,
take them as follows.</P>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>First VISION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the black of the Night, <HI>Lomon</HI>-top being two
Thirds dismal, came a light Gleam from the <HI>Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
thro' which, piercing Sight discovers, that in the Counci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the <HI>Northern</HI> World much Confusion happens in
the first of the Year about Peace and War; the Crowns

and Powers engaged against <HI>F—e</HI> inveigh against
one of their own Ally'd Branches, and being Exas∣perate
at that Power for what they call Betray∣ing
them, consult how to make Peace themselves,
and Avenge themselves of those who dealt Trea∣cherously
with them, but Power fails; I saw the Mu∣ster-Roll
of their devised Power too weak, so they
content themselves with Recording, that separating
Power in all their Archives as the most perfidious
Nation upon Earth, whether justly or no the Vision
says not.</P>
<P>A Voice I heard not, but in Capitals of bright
Air were written on a Cloud at inconceivable Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance,
such Words (tho' in Celestial Characters) as
these, <HI>The perfidious Nation trodden down of those she
Saved, and laugh'd at by those she Betrayed.</HI> In the
Measure of Time observ'd by our Ancestors from the
Degree of Brightness on the Cloud in the Center
of Vision, this Appearance signifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s twelve Years,
eleven Lunar Months, some Days, e'er it come to pass.</P>
<P>The bright little Body of Cloud which represented
Peace moved on, but stopp'd before the Place de∣sign'd
for its Rest; so no Peace seems to be yet
ripe enough to be declared in <HI>Europe,</HI> whether Ge∣neral
or Separate.</P>

lourd three Days and a half: There I see three
Months and half of this coming Year the Nations
of <HI>Europe</HI> shall prepare for War, tho' Peace be in
their Words, and I fear even then, another Year of
Blood e'er the Quiet of <HI>Europe</HI> be Established, the
louring Cloud ending in black, not bright, shows t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Whensoever the Conclusion of what the Peo∣ple

Expectation of every Side; those who expect the
Nation shall be effectually settled and quiet at
Home by having <HI>Peace</HI> Abroad, and those who
expect that new Wars shall immediately break
out Abroad, are equally deceiv'd; the furious
Agitation of Parties at Home rather encreases
than abates by the Stop which is put to the War
Abroad; strong siding against the Great Ones,
quarrelling the Peace, impeaching the Integrity
and Design of those who have brought it to this
Length, as what has been a Ruin to the Mea∣sures
formerly taken both at Home and Abroad;
great and formal Accusations of Ill Practises

bright <HI>Visions</HI> representing <HI>Peace,</HI> and comfort∣ing
Circumstances to <HI>Great-Britain, France</HI> and
<HI>Spain,</HI> and some other Parts of the World; but
by the Operation of our most clear Perception,
all appears dark again; towards the latter End
of the Year Clouds of Dissention arise in <HI>France;</HI>
perhaps the great Fury, whose Emblem is the Sun
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
in his full Strength, is now setting; if nor, if
Death is not his Portion, at this Time, some Ca∣pital
Disappointment shall attend him and his
Affairs: Misunderstandings are begun between
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> about this time, which in pro∣cess
of Years shall divide these two Nations as
much as ever, and tho' not in the Life of the

<HEAD>Tenth VISION.</HEAD>
<P>BY what Aspect our usual Appearances have
at our Tenth Observation, I see Hopes
that the End of the Year closes with <HI>Peace,</HI> and
for that reason I give you but <HI>Ten Visions</HI> for
this Year, whereas before it was in <HI>Twelve.</HI>
The Allies of <HI>Britain</HI> concluding, or not conclu∣ding,
we allow our selves to be in <HI>Peace:</HI> The
General Treaty eminently manag'd by the <HI>British</HI>
Influence, may not yet have effectually been fi∣nished,
but the <HI>Peace</HI> as entertain'd by the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Sovereign, appears made for our selves, and
such of our Allies as stand with us; the rest
complain loudly, and talk high, but see a Ne∣cessity
of Complying, and putting an End to the
War which now every Body think better of than
they did before.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22"/>
Many of my Second-Sighted Friends say openly
that they see farther than I have done into these
Things, which I will not deny; they pretend
to see that the <HI>Peace</HI> was made some time since,
with ill Views and ill Prospects, and by ill Men,
and will but ill last, and that many ill Conse∣quences
shall happen from it; but I shall rather
publish my own Views, and what my own Sight
discovers, than what these Men say: I cannot say
with Verity that I have such black Sights beyond
the Peace as they have, and therefore say to my
Countrymen and Friends, That if the ill Things
do follow the Peace which these Men predict, it
must, very much of it, be the Mis-management of
our own selves at Home that may procure it, and
that therefore, if they please, the <HI>Peace</HI> shall be
well or ill for them: Among those who have
it so much in their Power to better to us the
Effects of <HI>Peace,</HI> none so much as those who
make it; who, if they will prevent the Influences
of <HI>France</HI> over Affairs in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in the rest
of <HI>Europe,</HI> questionless may cause the Effects of
this <HI>Peace</HI> to be less hurtful to <HI>Britain</HI> than o∣therwise
it would be: These Men can, no doubt,
prevent the Dangers of the Party who favour a
Wrong Succession, and can bring the Nation to
a more settled Condition in that Affair than we
are in at present: Whether they shall do this or
not; whether they shall take Effectual Care or
no to prevent the Fears of the People, and farther
to secure us after a <HI>Peace,</HI> I shall give a more
direct Account of in my next Year's Predictions.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
The two last Months of this Year threaten
great Loss and Destruction in <HI>Europe</HI> by unusual
Tempests, especially about <HI>November,</HI> the ga∣thering.
Torrents I see evidently in the Air, and
all the Heats of Summer furnish Vapour for this
Irruption; it is probable the same shall be attend∣ed
with great Innundations of Water.</P>
<P>Some great Calamity threatens <HI>Germany</HI> and
<HI>Hungary;</HI> whether the <HI>Northern</HI> War shall break
out again, or whether the <HI>Turks</HI> shall fall in upon
the Empire, does not yet appear, but it seems that
the War in the <HI>North,</HI> notwithstanding all the
Endeavours of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to put an
End to it, shall not be finally concluded during
the length of these Predictions.</P>
<P>The Plague, as is usual at this Season of the
Year, ceases, or rather takes Breath only to re∣vive
with the more Fury, and if my <HI>Second Sight</HI>
says true to me, the next Year it shall begin in
these Countries, or entirely cease in <HI>EƲROPE.</HI></P>
