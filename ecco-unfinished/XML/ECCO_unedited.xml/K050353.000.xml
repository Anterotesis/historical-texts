<HEAD>Some farther Account OF THE Original Disputes In <HI>IRELAND,</HI> &amp;c,</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Need make no Apology for my En∣quiries into this Affair, with one who was entirely a Stranger, see∣ing he was no Stranger to the Thing I enquir'd after: It is enough to say, that meeting with a sensible and intelligent Person, <HI>one of the People call'd</HI> QUAKERS, and who came lately from <HI>Dublin,</HI> and falling into an Acquaintance with him, he occasionally menti∣on'd the Heats and Wrangling which they had very unhappily fallen into in <HI>Ireland,</HI> about the Currency of <HI>Copper-Money</HI> there.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
I had indeed, a long time wish'd for such an Opportunity to talk with somebody or other on that Subject, for I always believ'd what I am now confirm'd in, <HI>namely,</HI> that we never had a true, or at best, not a full Account of that Matter; and I that always lov'd to keep one Ear open, and if possible, to hear both Sides of a Question, had for some time suspended my Judgment in this Case, in hopes that I shou'd one time or other come to hear more of it.</P>
<P>In consequence of this Reserve of my Thoughts I told the honest QUAKER, I shou'd be very glad to have a full Account of that Affair, and ask'd him, if he had been acquainted with it? He gravely reply'd, Why truly I am well acquainted with it, Friend; but I find the Peo∣ple of <HI>England</HI> neither well acquainted with it, or willing to be inform'd: They are not all so, <HI>said I,</HI> for I am very desirous to be inform'd of it; and then I told him what I have said above, of my so long wishing for a full Account, and believing we had not been well us'd in it before.</P>
<P>Truly Friend, <HI>says he, thou</HI> hast judg'd rightly as to <HI>thy</HI> having heard but Part of this Story; but I fear <HI>thy</HI> Patience will not serve <HI>thee</HI> to hear the whole, for <HI>verily</HI> it will take up much Time, especially in my slow Way of speaking.</P>
<P>Well, I press'd him to give me a full Account of it, assuring him, that I had as much Pati∣ence as Curiosity; and that, <HI>in a word,</HI> I had so much Desire to hear it, that I cou'd not want
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Patience, if it held all Night, desiring him not to shorten any Part of; upon which he under∣took it, <HI>and began thus:</HI></P>
<P><HI>First he told me,</HI> That he suppos'd the chief In∣formation I had receiv'd of that Affair, was, from the Votes and Resolves of the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and their several Addresses to the King; <HI>I told him,</HI> It was so, including only two or three Letters, or Advertisements, publish'd by way of Libel, or Pamphlet, in some of our publick Papers.</P>
<P><HI>In truth,</HI> Friend, <HI>says he,</HI> I saw those Papers too, but they seem'd to be written by some Hand as ignorant as officious; so that I shou'd almost think, those which argued against the Copper-Money, were hir'd by the Adversary to expose the Cause, and give Advantages against themselves.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> but what say you to the Pro∣ceedings in the Parliament of <HI>Ireland?</HI></P>
<P>As for that, <HI>says he,</HI> e'en let <HI>thee</HI> and I lay them aside for the present; <HI>verily,</HI> they need not so much as be nam'd in the Case; neither shall I have any Occasion <HI>to speak of them</HI> in all my Discourse, except only as <HI>thou</HI> seest I do now, <HI>namely,</HI> to let <HI>thee</HI> know, that <HI>I do not speak of them.</HI></P>
<P>Those Assemblies, <HI>added he,</HI> which <HI>ye</HI> call <HI>Parlia∣ments,</HI> are Numbers of Men call'd together by our Government, to make and amend Laws, redress
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the Grievances, and do divers Things which are needful to be done; but they are compos'd of fallible Men, and I will not say they cannot Err, and be Mistaken, even in their Parliament Ca∣pacity; whether they have been now mistaken, or impos'd upon by subtle Men from Without-Doors, is not my present Business to say, or <HI>thine</HI> to enquire; to which I gave a little <HI>Hum,</HI> with like Gravity, <HI>and so he went on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me then,</HI> That I must therefore learn to distinguish in this Affair, between what was done in Parliament, and what was done out of Parliament; for indeed, <HI>says he,</HI> the Scheme of all this Matter was laid, and much transacted, before the Parliament came together, and con∣sequently what happen'd in Parliament, cou'd not be the Cause of what Opposition was resolv'd on, because then it must act before it had a Be∣ing; whether what was done in Parliament, was an Effect consequent to what went before? <HI>Of that, Friend,</HI> said he, <HI>judge Thou.</HI></P>
<P>Nor, <HI>says he,</HI> have you in <HI>England</HI> been only mi∣staken, by turning your Eyes to the Votes of Par∣liament, and to some foolish weak Papers, where one Part of the Fact is represented, and the o∣ther taken no Notice of; by which means your Judgments are biass'd, and prepossess'd, in Fa∣vour of that which is most popular: But <HI>says he,</HI> if I am not mistaken, <HI>thou</HI> art, and the People here in <HI>England</HI> have been amus'd, and led quite beside the Question; <HI>ye</HI> are taken up in discussing the Terms of the Grant; calculating the Value of the New Coin; the Profits of the Patentee; and
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the Advantage, or Disadvantage, which accrues to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> by this <HI>Copper-Mo∣ney;</HI> in all which Disputes and Calculations, <HI>adds my Friend,</HI> the <HI>Men of Art,</HI> thy <HI>Sons of Figures and Cyphers</HI> are most extreamly wrong, as I may tell <HI>thee</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>But there is, <HI>adds he,</HI> a previous Question, which shou'd have been first determin'd; and that is, <HI>What the main Question is?</HI> for verily we are by no means agreed about that yet, and till that is answer'd, all the rest is beating the Air, and dancing in a Circle.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says I,</HI> the main Question (as I under∣stand it) is, Whether the Farthings and Half∣pence are prejudicial, destructive, and dangerous to the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or whether they are not?</P>
<P>No, no, Friend <HI>says my</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> art mistaken quite, that is a Question, (and I may say something to that also hereafter) but that is not the main Question to be discuss'd, or which was first discus'd among us, in order to come at a clear Understanding of this Matter.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>said I,</HI> this was the Question debated and resolv'd in your Parliament.</P>
<P>I tell <HI>thee, said he somewhat pecvishly,</HI> I am not speaking of the Parliament; I wou'd not have them so much as nam'd, or any-thing done by them, mention'd; I am searching deeper into this Wound, than those State-Surgeons cou'd go, and
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
enquiring into what was before their Sitting, <HI>I mean in their last Sitting;</HI> therefore let them be no more spoken of in it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I,</HI> then the Question must be, whe∣ther the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are willing to receive these Farthings and Halfpence, or not; or whe∣ther they are illegally and arbitrarily impos'd up∣on them.</P>
<P>No, no, Friend, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> art still out of the right Way, <HI>thou</HI> wilt never come at the Bottom of the Business, by these Enqui∣ries; for in that the Patent will answer <HI>thee,</HI> and the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> will answer <HI>thee</HI> in the other: <HI>Then he added with some Warmth,</HI> The Farthings and Halfpence were not forc'd upon <HI>us illegally,</HI> or <HI>arbitrarily,</HI> for they were not forc'd upon <HI>us</HI> at-all: The Patent (or Grant) gave no Power to <HI>impose them;</HI> neither were WE in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> oblig'd to take one Ounce of them, unless we freely and willingly (and by our own Choice) agreed to take them. <HI>On the contrary,</HI> the Peo∣ple, <HI>as they</HI> extreamly wanted them, <HI>so they</HI> uni∣versally approv'd of them: I assure <HI>thee,</HI> I have not heard of one Gainsayer, or that offer'd to make the least Complaint against them, 'till they had been current, and past as Current-money a∣mong us, for several Months.</P>
<P>What then is the Case, <HI>said I,</HI> for you seem something mysterious about it?</P>
<P>Why, the main Question, <HI>Friend, says he,</HI> was, whether the Patent was rightly granted? And so
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the Quarrel was a Debate of Interest, and lay be∣tween <HI>William Wood,</HI> the present Patentee, and <HI>some other Persons,</HI> who laid their Hands upon it, in their Imagination: This, I say, is the Debate, and may be stated thus, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Coin∣age of <HI>Copper-Money, being very profitable in itself,</HI> shou'd continue to the said <HI>William Wood,</HI> to whom the King had granted it, or whether it wou'd not be much better to set him aside, and get it for <HI>our selves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hum! said I again,</HI> but who do you mean by <HI>our selves?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, but <HI>thou</HI> may'st not enquire too far into the Secrets of others, that is not right; howbeit, I may (perhaps) open some Part of the Matter unto <HI>thee,</HI> in the latter End of the Story; for I do not say, that the Men have no Names, nor do I say, that their Names are not known also: But of that also in its Place.</P>
<P>I begin to understand you, Friend, <HI>says I,</HI> and if I am right, you would have us believe, that there was an original Design, or Conspiracy, a∣mong a Sett of Persons in <HI>Ireland; in short,</HI> to sup∣plant Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> get his Patent set aside, and af∣terward to get a Grant of it for themselves.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>thou hast said, says the</HI> QUAKER, but I did not tell <HI>thee,</HI> that I wou'd have <HI>thee</HI> believe me; for of what Consequence is it to me, <HI>Friend, says he,</HI> when I talk to <HI>thee</HI> of these Things, whe∣ther <HI>thou</HI> believest me or no?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Well, well, <HI>says I,</HI> I see you are searching it to the Bottom indeed; pray go on with your Story then, and I will not interrupt you any more with my Enquiries: So he went on indeed, in a surprizing manner, <HI>to me;</HI> and by which I was fully convinc'd, that really we in <HI>England</HI> had all-along taken this Affair by the wrong Handle, had seen it in a false Light, and that in∣deed we knew nothing at-all of the Matter.</P>
<P>He then went on, I say, and repeating to me the general Satisfaction with which the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as he had said before) first receiv'd the Farthings and Halfpence; <HI>he told me,</HI> they did receive them, as Things they had not only a good Opinion of, but as what they were in great Want of; that after the first News of the Grant, and that the Coining of them was in hand, which was some time before they arriv'd, the People were very impatient for their coming, and often express'd their Concern, lest the Coinage shou'd not go forward; that this did not arise from the usual Eagerness of People after Novelty, but from the real Want the Country was in of small Money, for the Supply of petty Cash, Ex∣change of larger Species, for buying Provisions in small Quantities, and for all the other Occa∣sions, in which small Money is usually made use of.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> that as soon as the Copper-Mo∣ney appear'd, it met with a general Approbation; the People took it with so free a Consent, that it became universally current: There was no Ob∣jections
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
rais'd, either against its Figure, which was very beautiful, or the Workmanship, which was compleat, or the Value and Fineness of the Metal, which (it was well known) the Grant it self had provided for, and which in Appear∣ance seem'd to be such as was reasonable, and duely proportion'd to the Nature of the thing, and to the Usage in other Parts of the King's Do∣minions, in like Cases.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>he said,</HI> they were something LIGHTER than the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but then, <HI>he added,</HI> they were HEAVIER than the <HI>Bodles</HI> and <HI>Baubees</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there was just Reasons to be given for the Difference in both; but, <HI>says he,</HI> of that I shall talk far∣ther with <HI>thee</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>Then he went on to tell me, that this general Approbation of the People continued a great∣while; for verily <HI>Friend, says he,</HI> we very sensi∣bly felt the Ease they were to us in Trade; the Shop-keepers (in particular) felt the Advantage in their Retail Business; and it was impossible we cou'd act against our Light, so as to com∣plain of that which we so universally rejoic'd at: I say, <HI>he affirm'd,</HI> that this general Approba∣tion of the People continued a great-while, and that even when Complaints began to be heard, they had not their beginning among the trading Part of the Nation: Nay, <HI>he told me, and bid me remark it,</HI> that some of those very Persons who afterwards appear'd to be concern'd most vi∣olently against the Copper-Farthings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were for some time the most forward to approve of
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
them, and applaud the Advantage, which ac∣crued to the Publick by them; that they were Advocates on all publick Occasions for the Pa∣tentee; appear'd extreamly pleas'd that the Coin obtain'd so general a Currency in Trade, and that the People were so well satisfy'd with it; and, <HI>says he in his rough Way,</HI> whether they LY'D then, or since, they know best.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>says I,</HI> art <HI>thou</HI> well satisfy'd, or can'st <HI>thou</HI> make it appear, that these Men did not change their Opinion, 'till, <HI>as thou say'st,</HI> they form'd a Conspiracy to supplant Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Patent.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Friend, says he, thou</HI> dost not use me fair∣ly now; for that is to put me upon the Proof of Hours and Minutes, when Things were done, which were done in the Dark; for as <HI>thou</HI> hast call'd it a <HI>Conspiracy, (which 1 did not)</HI> it must then be secret, and I cannot speak to Minutes; but 'tis enough to say, <HI>First,</HI> That those very Men did some time after raise Clamours, and bring evil Ac∣cusations against the Grant for <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Half∣pence,</HI> against the Coin itself, and against <HI>thy</HI> Friend, <HI>William Wood,</HI> the Patentee, to whom the Privilege is granted. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That some Persons have propos'd to get a Grant to them∣selves, and set up such another Coinage on their own Account, as soon as this can be set aside: This, <HI>says he,</HI> I believe they will put no-body to the Trouble of proving.</P>
<P>Then he gave me a long Account of the Per∣sons concern'd, the Measures concerted, and the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Advantages propos'd by those People, who, <HI>as he said,</HI> were thus engag'd against Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Patent, and by what Arts they propos'd to bring it before the King, in order to obtain the recalling Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Grant: When I wou'd have ask'd him, by what secret Management they had been able to bring it into Parliament, and brought the Houses to espouse it, as they had done; he took me short, and seem'd angry, reminding me, that he had said, he wou'd not meddle with that Part, or so much as name the Parliament, in all his Discourse; that he cou'd give me a suffi∣cient Account of the Matter without it; and that I might enquire that Part of some-body else, if I found his Relation was imperfect.</P>
<P>I pacify'd him as well as I cou'd, and brought him to go on; then he gave himself some <HI>loose</HI> at the Injustice and Unfairness of this Proceed∣ing; how they abus'd the People, in laying the Complaint in their Names, who, <HI>as he said,</HI> he was well inform'd, never complain'd at all, or had any Inclination to do so: Not the Privy-Council, <HI>he said,</HI> not the Lord Lieutenant, not the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>Dublin,</HI> or of any other City, had ever any Petitions, or Representations, a∣gainst the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> no Grand-Ju∣ry ever presented them; no Merchants; <HI>in a Word, he added,</HI> that no Man, or Society of Men, open'd their Mouths against them; nay, <HI>adds he,</HI> I may say, not a Dog wagg'd his Tongue against them, 'till this Fire burst out, as from a secret Mine (like a Powder-Plot) to blow up both <HI>Patent</HI> and <HI>Patentee,</HI> in order to set up an∣other in its Room.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
He goes on then to tell me, That this being the secret History of the Thing itself, the Per∣sons concern'd in it were not so secret, but that many People guess'd at their Names, as well as their Undertaking; and it was given out, that they were Men of such Figure and Interest, that they did not doubt they shou'd obtain their Re∣quest, <HI>namely,</HI> To set aside the <HI>Patent: He said,</HI> It was not known at first which Way they wou'd go to work, or what Measures they wou'd take to get this done, much less was it so much as guess'd, that they wou'd get the Parliament to espouse it: Nor, <HI>adds he,</HI> do I say yet, that the Parliament did appear in it, by the procuring of these Men, and therefore I say nothing to that; for he kept close to the Point, that he wou'd not concern the Parliament in any Part of his Dis∣course, nor wou'd he suffer me so much as to name them on that Occasion.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>he said,</HI> the first Prejudices began in Avarice and private Interest, among a Sett of Men, who form'd their Designs wholly and sole∣ly upon the View of their own Advantage.</P>
<P>As soon as they had form'd their Design, <HI>he said,</HI> they set their Wheels to work, to raise Complaints among the People, against the <HI>Cop∣per-Money;</HI> and tho', <HI>he said,</HI> they went about it with the utmost Subtlety and Art, and spread their empty Objections among the People, by their Agents, in several Parts of the Kingdom, yet they con'd never make any-thing of it, nor bring their <HI>Clamours</HI> to be popular; for the People
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
being sensible of the Utility of the <HI>Copper-Money,</HI> not only by Judgment or Opinion, but by Expe∣rience, and by feeling the Difference in their Trade, cou'd never be brought to join with them in their Complaints, much less to make any Ap∣plication to the Government against them; tho' <HI>as he said,</HI> he was inform'd, much Endeavour was us'd to bring them to it; so that, <HI>in a Word, he said,</HI> they seem'd discourag'd and silent again; and People began to think, they had given over the Design; but in this, <HI>he added,</HI> we were mi∣staken; for as Avarice is unwearied, they seem'd to imitate the fam'd Resolution,</P>
<P><HI>—Acheronta movebo,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then he told me,</HI> he heard, that a little before the meeting of the Parliament, they had renew'd their Attack, and try'd some great Person; he does not say (neither was he certain) who it was, but intimates some Man of Note; and that find∣ing still no Encouragement (every unprejudic'd Person being against them) they gave it out, that they wou'd bring it into Parliament; and, <HI>says he,</HI> I hear (since I came away) it has been brought into Parliament; but that, <HI>adds he,</HI> as also being since my arriving in <HI>England,</HI> I will have nothing to say to.</P>
<P>Here he seem'd to stop, as if he had done, and so indeed he had, as to the Historical Part of his Account; but I, who wanted much to hear his Opinion of the Arguments on both Sides, soon set him on again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
But pray, <HI>says I,</HI> what had they to say against the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence?</HI> for you say they were evidently useful to the Country.</P>
<P>I did indeed, <HI>says he,</HI> affirm to <HI>thee,</HI> that the People were pleas'd with them, and found them very beneficial; and I own, my Opinion is, they were really so; but <HI>thou</HI> know'st that greater People than I, say they are of another Opinion: Now this he said with a kind of a <HI>Grin,</HI> that in my Thoughts intimated a Contempt of those Opinions; and then he went on, <HI>and told me,</HI> That as to the Arguments those Men brought against the Copper-Money, before he came away; they were, <HI>he said,</HI> the weakest, and most emp∣ty, that ever he cou'd have expected to have come from Men of Sence, and that they had no Weight at-all in them; and even the Com∣mon People began, <HI>to use his own Words,</HI> to have them in Derision.</P>
<P>First, <HI>he said,</HI> they gave it out, that they were useless; that there was no Occasion for them; that Farthings and Halfpence, indefinite∣ly and merely as Farthings and Halfpence, were of no Service to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> that they were of no Advantage to the Commerce; <HI>nay, he added,</HI> they went farther at length, for they wou'd have it be, that they were prejudi∣cial and destructive to Trade; but they seem'd to forget in this, that they were preparing a Mine against their own Project, and also that the common Opinion of the People was against them; and indeed, they began to expose them∣selves
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
by it, to ridicule and Laughter; seeing <HI>he said,</HI> they dropt that Part, tho' not without acknowledging it to be a Mistake, and then pub∣lickly own'd, that they wou'd have those <HI>Eng∣lish Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> cry'd down; and that they wou'd supply the Country with others coin'd among themselves; and to make this look a little popular, they talk'd of setting to-work upon some Copper-Mines, which were formerly discover'd in their own Country.</P>
<P>This, <HI>he said,</HI> had been a little more rational, if they cou'd ha' got over two Things, <HI>namely,</HI> (1.) Upon what foot this cou'd be done, if what they had given-out before, and had not yet re∣call'd, were true; <HI>namely,</HI> That meer <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were destructive to the Trade of the Kingdom. (2.) That the Kingdom had no need of them.</P>
<P>But first, to blast the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in general, as <HI>destructive</HI> and <HI>needless,</HI> and then tell the World, they intended to <HI>make some them∣selves;</HI> this was so plain a Discovery, <HI>he said,</HI> that whatever it did in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he observ'd the People got hold of it here in <HI>England,</HI> and almost made a Jest of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, for being so grossly impos'd upon.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>he said,</HI> they pull'd in their Horns a little, <HI>as it were,</HI> and taking Breath, they began upon a new Sett of Arguments; but these, <HI>he said,</HI> were (in the examining them) found to be as weak, and had as little Weight in them as the other, only that indeed there was not so gross an
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Absurdity, nor so barefac'd an Insult upon the Country, in them, as in the other.</P>
<P>Then he told me, how their Emissaries ran up and down, exclaiming against the Injustice of putting a Coinage upon them from <HI>England;</HI> that it was an Invasion of the Liberties of the People; that it was a Monopoly, and a Piece of Arbi∣trary Power; nay, some went farther, and re∣flected upon the Grant itself, and consequently upon the Person granting it; and that it was a dangerous Precedent at best; that the King had been impos'd upon by <HI>William Wood,</HI> and <HI>his Ac∣complices;</HI> and had had the State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> very much misrepresented to him, insinu∣ating, <HI>he said,</HI> that the King had granted this <HI>Patent,</HI> without the Advice of his Council, or without being duly inform'd of the State of Things in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>This was a sure Card, <HI>he said,</HI> to bring all the Papists, and Enemies to the <HI>Government,</HI> into the Party, and to make them universally Enemies to the <HI>Copper-Coinage,</HI> they being known to be forward, and glad of an Opportunity to close with any-thing, which they think will make a Clamour at the <HI>English Government,</HI> or the present Administration under the Reign of King <HI>GEORGE.</HI></P>
<P>This was a wicked, but a very politick Step, <HI>he said,</HI> for then (and not till then) the Com∣plaint at the <HI>English Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> be∣gan to be loud, and make a Noise; and that Noise to be propagated in the remotest Parts
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of the Country; and thus, <HI>added he,</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> suffers in good Company, for the Clamour at the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> became really a Clamour at the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> but why was this so weak and so empty a Complaint?</P>
<P>Why <HI>truly, said he,</HI> because it was <HI>not Truth,</HI> and then he went of his own Accord into a Dis∣course upon the Merits of the <HI>Patent,</HI> and par∣ticularly upon the Right the King had to grant such a <HI>Patent:</HI> The Clamour against <HI>England, he said,</HI> and particularly against the King, was not on∣ly an ill-natur'd thing, but was without sufficient ground; for, <HI>said he,</HI> they can't deny but the Coin∣age is the King's; that it is his Prerogative, and one of the ordinary Appendixes to the Right of <HI>Government;</HI> that the King (in all Nations where they have Kings reigning) appoint the Coinage of Money; that the Image and Superscription tell whose it is; and that <HI>Ireland,</HI> no more than <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland</HI> cou'd complain against it; in both which Places, as he understood it, <HI>he said,</HI> the Coinage was appointed by the King; and particularly, <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> had formerly been coin'd in <HI>England,</HI> for the Account of private Persons, and that by <HI>Patent,</HI> or <HI>Grant,</HI> in the same manner as was now in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and there∣fore the granting, or appointing, such a Coinage cou'd not be illegal or arbitrary.</P>
<P>Then he took Notice of the Terms of the <HI>Pa∣tent</HI> itself; the Care his Majesty had taken of the Rights and Properties of his Subjects of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>

in the Terms of the Grant, and in the Li∣mitations of the Privileges given to the <HI>Paten∣tee;</HI> and as a Digression, he express'd himself very largely, and indeed more fully than I expected from one of his Profession, in Defence of his Majesty's Conduct, and of the Ministers of State also, in this very Grant.</P>
<P>The King, <HI>he said,</HI> had shewn such a Care and Concern, for the Good of all his Subjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well for their Liberties, as the Prosperity of their Trade, in all the Articles of this <HI>Patent,</HI> as evidently shew'd, he fully un∣derstood the true Interest of the Kingdom, and the State of his People <HI>there;</HI> and that he neither was, or cou'd be impos'd upon by my Friend <HI>Wood,</HI> or any-one else; and such a Care as ought to make 'em asham'd (whoever they were) who had suggested to the contrary: <HI>Then he went on, and told me</HI> all the Limitations, which were inserted in the <HI>Patent,</HI> by which the Fine∣ness of the Metal, with the Weight and Value of the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were ascertain'd, that so the People might not be injur'd in either, the Quantity also to be coin'd ascertain'd, that they might not be glutted with an exorbi∣tant Sum; and that, <HI>after all,</HI> the People were entirely left at Liberty to take <HI>them,</HI> or refuse <HI>them,</HI> no Man having any Power to impose one single <HI>Farthing</HI> or <HI>Halfpenny</HI> upon them, without their Consent.</P>
<P>Here he expatiated again upon the Difference between the mild and gentle Reign of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> and the former Tyranny which
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
they groan'd under, in the Times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. and the false Money and Cop∣per-Money impos'd in both these Reigns; parti∣cularly the last, when little more than a Copper <HI>Halfpenny</HI> was made current for <HI>Half a Crown;</HI> but this (however handsomely indeed express'd) I omit for want of Room.</P>
<P>He likewise enlarg'd upon the Conduct and Fidelity of the <HI>British</HI> Ministers of State, in the several Inspections, References, and Reports from one to another, in the ordinary Forms of pas∣sing this <HI>Patent;</HI> how it had all the mature Con∣deration, and Consultation, as well before the <HI>Privy-Council,</HI> as the <HI>Treasury,</HI> the <HI>Attorney-Gene∣ral,</HI> and the <HI>Lord-Chancellor,</HI> thro' all whose Hands it severally pass'd; in order that nothing unjust, illegal, or arbitrary, or hard, and severe to the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> shou'd pass, or be al∣low'd in it: Particularly he spoke [with the ut∣most Regard] of Mr. <HI>Wa—le,</HI> who, <HI>he said,</HI> fully understood the Nature of the Thing, and he was not to be impos'd upon by any-body, in suffering such a <HI>Grant</HI> to pass in the King his Master's Name, without so many Precautions and Provisions, as wou'd for ever make it im∣possible for the worst Enemy the King had, to lay any just Reproach, either upon the Nature of the <HI>Grant,</HI> or the Manner of granting it: <HI>And here he told me,</HI> That besides the Care taken to li∣mit the <HI>Patentee</HI> [as above] from any Misappli∣cation of the <HI>Patent,</HI> to the Injury or Burden of the Subject, due Care was also taken to appoint such a <HI>Checque</HI> and <HI>Comptrole</HI> over the <HI>Patentee,</HI> as that it shou'd not be in his Power to make
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
any Excursions, beyond the Bounds of the said Powers granted; and to finish all, the <HI>Comptoller</HI> [thus appointed] was to make report, from time to time, to the <HI>Lords of the Treasury,</HI> of all that should be done in Pursuance of the <HI>Patent:</HI> This, <HI>he said,</HI> was particularly owing to the Conduct of Mr. <HI>Wa —le;</HI> of whom he said a great∣deal, and greatly to his Advantage, which I have not Room to bring in here.</P>
<P>I confess, I was surpriz'd to hear all this from a Stranger, who had liv'd thus remote; and was extreamly glad, to find his Majesty, and his Ministers of State, so well treated; and that the King especially, whose Actions [I was before assur'd] are always guided with the most exqui∣site Care, and Concern, for the Good of his Sub∣jects, in all his Dominions; I say, I was ex∣treamly glad, to find his Majesty had so much Justice done him, and that his whole Administra∣tion was so effectually vindicated by a plain [but well-meaning] Man, so remote from the Place where these Things were done.</P>
<P>But I confess, when he told me, that by this <HI>Grant</HI> the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> were left so entirely free in this whole Affair, that they might take the said Copper-Money, or refuse it, as they pleas'd; that not the meanest Person in the Kingdom was to be impos'd upon, or oblig'd to accept them in Payment, or deliver their Goods for them; I say, when I heard this, and that he pull'd out a Copy of the <HI>Grant,</HI> and shew'd it me in so many Words, I was, from that Mo∣ment, entirely at a loss, to find which Way the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Injury to the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> cou'd be made out, or the Damage to their Trade be made rational; but then I pull'd out some Printed Papers, which I had met with in the Town, where this Matter was very much canvas'd, as particularly <HI>Mist's Journal, the Whitehall Evening-Post, Boyer's</HI> scanda∣lous <HI>Political State,</HI> and such like Pamphlets; and began to enter into some Discourse about them.</P>
<P>But he took me short with a Question: Do'st <HI>thou</HI> know, <HI>said he,</HI> what our People in <HI>Ireland</HI> say of those Libels? No, <HI>says I;</HI> Why they say, <HI>says he,</HI> that Friend <HI>William Wood</HI> the <HI>Pa∣tentee,</HI> had hir'd some subtle Fellow to write a Libel, and publish it in <HI>Mist's Journal, &amp;c.</HI> which was to be perform'd weakly and scandalously, to form Cavils against the Patent, that he might have the Advantage of confuting and exposing them; as those who write Dialogues make the Enquirer propose none but weak Que∣stions, that they may be answer'd to the Ad∣vantage of the Party he writes for.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> that was begging the Question, and alledging nothing, especially as to the Objections about the Value, and the Injury done the People: Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> I do not tell <HI>thee</HI> that 'tis so, but that indeed it is done very weakly and follish∣ly, that cannot be denied.</P>
<P>But one thing, <HI>he said,</HI> cou'd not be omitted as to these Libels; <HI>namely,</HI> How much con∣cern'd the Party who oppos'd this Patent, were, to make their Clamours popular; and that you in <HI>England said he,</HI> shou'd hear one side of
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
the Question, where you cou'd not so readily know what the Sentiments of the People in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> were, which is the other side of it: <HI>Then he observ'd,</HI> how unjust and unfair the Way of Arguing was; that seeing the small Copper-Money is chiefly appointed for the Use of the Common People, and that in the Retail Trade, those People are indeed, best able to judge whether they had Need of them, and whether they were any Con∣venience to them or no; yet <HI>in Truth, says he,</HI> they have not been enquir'd of in this Mat∣ter.</P>
<P>Here he made another Digression upon the Want they had been in for many Years, of such Species of Money; how Retailers, for want of small Money, were oblig'd to keep long Scores, and give long Credit to their Customers, for little things, till they were frequently forgot, or more frequently lost; that those who wou'd not keep such Scores, and give such Credit, were oblig'd to sit still, and not sell their Goods; so that Trade was cramp'd, and made both difficult and hazardous: That all the Help they had against this, was from several sorts of small Money, such as <HI>Rapps, French Threepences, Rials,</HI> and such like; which, in the first Place, <HI>he said,</HI> did not supply the want of <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> their Quan∣tity being small: And, 2. They were brought into <HI>Ireland</HI> much more to the Loss of the Publick, than the Copper-Money now complain'd of.</P>
<P>For Brevity sake, I omit a great deal of what he offer'd on that Account, wherein I thought it was so evidence that <HI>Ireland</HI> was in great Want
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
of a Copper Coinage, that I wonder'd much at what I had heard here in <HI>England</HI> upon that Sub∣ject: But to go on, I then ask'd him what he said to all the Calculations which I shew'd him in our printed Papers, of the great Loss to the Publick, which there wou'd necessarily be in this Money at last, the exorbitant Gain of the <HI>Paten∣tee,</HI> and the Injustice of both.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> It was evident to any that wou'd impartially look into that Matter, that those Calculations were all false and unjust; and that they were made, by Persons who either mistook thro' Ignorance, or from a worse Principle; and that he wou'd undertake to convince me, that not one of them was justly drawn up; <HI>he added,</HI> that he cou'd easily confute them all; nay, <HI>added he,</HI> even <HI>Friend Wood</HI> himself, or those who have written in his Defence, have not given the due Weight to his own Cause; but much more is to be said on that Occasion.</P>
<P>I wou'd have enter'd, one by one, into the ge∣neral Valuations on the one side, and on the o∣ther, which I shew'd him in the printed Papers; but <HI>he said,</HI> it needed not; that he had seen them all, and that he wou'd give me a few Ex∣planations, which if I thought fit to bestow my Thoughts upon, wou'd enable me to give full Answers to them all, wherever I met with them.</P>
<P><HI>First, he said,</HI> No Man ought to suppose, that a Coinage of <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> cou'd be set-up, wherein the Coin shou'd bear the full Weight and Value of the Principles from which
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
it was form'd; or that there shou'd not be an Al∣lowance for the preparing the Metal, and the Incidents attending it; for the Coinage itself, and the Utensils, Places of Workmanship, Officers, and Persons employ'd, <HI>that is to say,</HI> Labour, <HI>and the like;</HI> the general Coinage <HI>says he,</HI> is not done without it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, he said,</HI> No Man ought to suppose, that the Grant was given to any Person for such an Undertaking, attended with so much Risque, Application and Expence, and where so great a Stock also was requir'd, and that he, <HI>the Undertaker,</HI> shou'd not have a reasonable Gain from it, for the Encouragement of the Undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, he said,</HI> if these Allowances for the Expences, and Incidents in preparing and coining this Money, did not exceed the like Allowances, which have usually been made in the like Cases, [except where the different Circumstance of the Country made it reasonable] then the <HI>Patentee</HI> has not put any-thing upon the World, which is not justifiable by the Custom and Usage of <HI>Patentees,</HI> in like Cases, and also by the Privileges and Grants of this particular <HI>Patent.</HI></P>
<P>These three Considerations, <HI>he said,</HI> wou'd effectually remove all just Complaints from the Person, or Conduct, of the <HI>Patentee;</HI> and as to the Value of his <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halspence,</HI> and as to the Advantage or Disadvantage to Trade, and to the Publick by them, he wou'd speak to that Part by itself.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
As to the Value of the Copper, the Expence of Coinage, and Profit of the <HI>Patentee,</HI> he stated them together thus:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> he objected, that there was some De∣bate about the current Value of Copper in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> which some wou'd have be call'd 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound, others 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound; but as he said, he had been a Merchant, and had imported Copper himself, as well from <HI>Sweden</HI> as from <HI>England,</HI> and likewise from <HI>Barbary,</HI> he cou'd not afford to sell the Copper in Bulk, under 14 <HI>d.</HI> but often sold it for 15 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound; that if Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> by buying it in <HI>England,</HI> did get it cheaper, that was not the Question here at-all; but we ought to suppose it at 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>says he,</HI> I am not to enquire what the Profit to the <HI>Patentee</HI> immediately is, upon this Pound of Copper, for that is not the Question; but what it is more than the Profit of the like Coinage in <HI>England,</HI> and then see what Reasons can be given for the Difference; and by this it will appear whether the <HI>Patentee</HI> is chargable with Exorbitance, or not.</P>
<P>In <HI>England, says he,</HI> a Pound of Copper makes 45 <HI>Halspence,</HI> sometimes 46; in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by this new Patent, we have 60; so that Friend <HI>Wood</HI> says, he makes 7 <HI>d. halfpenny</HI> in a Pound of <HI>Copper</HI> more of his Coinage than is made in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
I was surpriz'd at his Way of reckoning, for I was going to draw the Account out in Co∣lumns, as the printed Papers have done; but he took me short; No, no, <HI>he said,</HI> their Business was not to enquire what Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> got by the Coinage, but what he got more than was gotten by the same Works in <HI>England;</HI> for if they in <HI>Ireland</HI> had but Neighbours Fare, it was what cou'd not be objected against: Therefore, <HI>says he,</HI> I have nothing to do with the Expence of preparing the Metal, or of the Coinage, the Al∣lowances on one hand or other; here is 7 <HI>d. halfpenny per</HI> Pound Difference, let us see how Friend <HI>Wood</HI> accounts for that, and what he has to say why he shou'd make <HI>Ireland</HI> pay 7 <HI>d. half∣penny per</HI> Pound more than <HI>England</HI> pays for the same Species.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> this is a short Way of coming at the Question, indeed; pray go on.</P>
<P>Why first, <HI>says he,</HI> the Copper in <HI>Ireland</HI> is granted to be of the Value of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, which is 2 <HI>d.</HI> more than in <HI>England;</HI> so there is 2 <HI>d.</HI> of the 7 <HI>d. halfpenny;</HI> then there is the Difference of Exchange upon his Money, which at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is 3 <HI>d.</HI> in the Half-Crown more; but because a very critical Opposer may insist, that these two Articles relating only to the Difference of Value between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> are there∣fore in some respect the same, I will set by the Difference of the Price of Copper in this part of the Discourse, and only take the bare Ex∣change of Money, which the <HI>Patentee</HI> must sink,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
to bring back his Money to <HI>England,</HI> in order to go to Market for more Copper.</P>
<P>This Rate of Exchange being one time with another 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is 2 <HI>s. per l.</HI> which is just 3 <HI>d.</HI> on the Pound of Copper.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>says he,</HI> there is the Charge of ship∣ping the Coin, suppose at <HI>Bristol,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> when finish'd; the Freight to <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Landing there; the Risque of the Sea; the Charge on∣shore, <HI>such as</HI> Warehouse-room, Commission to the Persons disposing of it, and Commission a∣gain for remitting back the Effects: If all this is not to be computed at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more, I must see some Reasons given to the contrary, which I do not see yet, before I allow it.</P>
<P>He then went on to innumerate several other Particulars, which added to Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Charge, as well before, as after the Coinage here, which the Coinage at the <HI>Tower</HI> is not loaded with; Particularly, that all Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Servants, and Workmen, Engines, Tools, Buildings, and Con∣veniences, are hir'd on purpose, and maintain'd solely for this one Work; and consequently his Charge of Servants and Workmen is greater, than at the <HI>Tower,</HI> where all things are prepar'd for other Branches of the Coinage, as well as that of the Copper-Money, and where the Servants are employ'd in common upon the one as well as the other, and consequently the Charge is not equal: But all this, <HI>he said,</HI> he only mention'd, for that besides this, the other two Articles had brought his Calculation beyond what his Argu∣ment
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
call'd for; and it appear'd, that <HI>Ireland</HI> had their <HI>Farthings</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> cheaper, the Circum∣stances of their Situation consider'd, one <HI>Half∣penny</HI> in a Pound-weight, than <HI>England</HI> receiv'd theirs from the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>With this Addition also, That if the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were all to be melted down, and reduc'd into meer Copper-Metal, the said Copper-wou'd sell for 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound weight more than the reduc'd Copper in <HI>England</HI> wou'd sell for; so that <HI>Ireland</HI> wou'd be less a Loser than <HI>England,</HI> by 1 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. per l.</HI> Sterling; which is 6 <HI>l.</HI> 13. 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd not deny but his Calculation was just so far.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>said he,</HI> I have gain'd that Point, and <HI>thou</HI> must allow, that Friend <HI>Wood</HI> does not get more by the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> than the Government gains, (if it be gain'd) by the like Species coin'd at the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise, <HI>said he, thou</HI> can'st not but see, that the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has acted not only with a due Regard to Justice, but with a prudent Re∣gard to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland;</HI> not to lay any Bur∣then upon them, but what the Nature of the thing, and the Circumstances of the Kingdom made necessary; and that they are so far from having reason to complain of being oppress'd, or impos'd arbitrarily upon, and having harder Terms than <HI>England,</HI> that on the contrary, they have rather the Advantage, than the Disadvan∣tage,
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
of <HI>England,</HI> in this Grant, and that in every Part of it.</P>
<P>But where then, <HI>said I,</HI> is Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Profit?</P>
<P><HI>I tell thee,</HI> says he, <HI>speaking a little warm,</HI> That's nothing to me, or to <HI>thee,</HI> as to the Matter in debate: If there is a Profit in the Coinage in the <HI>Tower,</HI> so there may be to him in his Coin∣age at <HI>Bristol;</HI> and yet even in that, as I have told <HI>thee</HI> already, his Profit must be much less than theirs at the <HI>Tower,</HI> many Ways; but that, <HI>he said,</HI> was one of the present Questions which he challeng'd me to answer, if I cou'd, <HI>namely,</HI> Whether Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> Friend <HI>Wood he call'd him,</HI> had made any Advantage, by virtue of this Grant, more than was made of the like Coin∣age in <HI>England?</HI> And whether <HI>Ireland</HI> had not their <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> as cheap, <HI>their own Circumstances only excepted,</HI> as <HI>England</HI> had theirs? Which indeed, I cou'd not deny.</P>
<P>But I have not done with <HI>thee</HI> yet, <HI>says my</HI> QUAKER; for I shall now undertake to tell <HI>thee,</HI> and perhaps prove it as plainly as I have done the other:</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the <HI>Patentee</HI> really does, and indeed must, dispose of these <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Half∣pence,</HI> they are in effect, very little Loss to <HI>Ireland;</HI> no, tho' they were to be reduc'd immediately to their first Principles, and sold in Bulk as meer Copper.</P>
<P N="2">2. That as he may dispose of them, and as I, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, am told, he has of∣fer'd to dispose of them, they will be so far
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
from being any Loss to the publick Stock of the Kingdom, that if <HI>Ireland</HI> will do Ju∣stice to the <HI>Patentee</HI> and his Assigns, they shall after a certain Period of Years, call them all in at Demand, and he shall pay for them the full Value they were at first issu'd out at, and that in the current Money of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I look'd a little surpriz'd at him, and desir'd to know how this cou'd be made out? <HI>He told me,</HI> it wou'd be too long to enter upon at that time, unless I had a great-deal more Patience than he thought I had; however, as he found me eager to be inform'd, and that, <HI>he said,</HI> I might set it in a clear Light to others, <HI>he told me,</HI> he wou'd enter a little upon the First, and if we had not Time for the rest, it shou'd be adjourn'd to our next Leisure.</P>
<P>He began then with the First, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>He bid me observe, that as <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were the lowest Species of Coin, so they were dispos'd of, <HI>generally speaking,</HI> among the meanest sort of the trading People; and in Consequence of this, <HI>he said,</HI> they were ordina∣rily exchang'd for the meanest Species of Mo∣ney; and that particularly, for <HI>French Threepen∣ces</HI> and <HI>Groats,</HI> quarters of <HI>Livres, and the like,</HI> and at the best, for <HI>Rials</HI> or <HI>Cobbs</HI> by weight, or <HI>English</HI> Money by tale.</P>
<P>Of the last we cou'd not suppose, <HI>he said,</HI> much was receiv'd; but of the former, the greatest Part; it ought then to be enquir'd, <HI>he</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<HI>said,</HI> what Loss there wou'd be to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> upon that <HI>French</HI> and Foreign Money, those <HI>Threepences, Quarter-pieces,</HI> &amp;c. in case they were to be reduc'd to <HI>Metal?</HI> and whatever that was, so much ought to be deducted out of the Loss which it might be suppos'd <HI>Ireland</HI> wou'd lose by the Reduction of <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> into Copper; for <HI>(to make it plainer) he said,</HI> If <HI>Ireland</HI> buys the <HI>Farthings,</HI> &amp;c. when they are current, or to make them current, tho' they are not of the full Value for which they are made current, and pays for them in another Coin, which is likewise not of the full Value for which it passes as current, then no more of the Loss by the Deficiency cou'd be plac'd to the Account of the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> than the Difference was between the Loss on the separate Reduction on the several Species: <HI>For Example,</HI> he said,</P>
<P>Suppose the <HI>French</HI> Threepences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pass in <HI>Ireland</HI> for Threepence, and being reduc'd, are found not to be of more Value than Two∣pence, losing thereby one Third, when they are turn'd into Metal, and sold in Bulk.</P>
<P>And supposing, <HI>tho' not granting,</HI> that the Far∣things lost one Half, when reduc'd into Metal; why then, <HI>he added, Ireland</HI> cou'd be said to lose no more by the <HI>Farthings,</HI> than the Difference be∣tween one Third and one Half, which wou'd be thus,</P>

So that here is but <HI>5 d.</HI> by <HI>2 s. 6 d.</HI> Loss to <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> more than <HI>Ireland</HI> was in a declar'd State of losing before; which, <HI>said he,</HI> is but ⅙ Part, and this not till the Money is reduc'd neither: Let them shew me, <HI>said he,</HI> any <HI>Copper Coinage</HI> made current in the World on so easy Terms: Then he shew'd me how the same stood in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> there, <HI>said he,</HI> 45 <HI>Halfpence</HI> are made of a Pound of <HI>Copper,</HI> and pass for <HI>1 s. 10 d. ob.</HI> and are bought for so much in good Standard Silver or Gold; when these are reduc'd to Me∣tal, <HI>said he,</HI> they sell but for <HI>1 s.</HI> and so lose <HI>10 d. ob. per</HI> Pound, which is above double the Loss of that in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>said I,</HI> if they sell the <HI>Farthings, &amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for <HI>French Threepences,</HI> they likewise put off those <HI>Threepences</HI> again in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and so the Publick bears the Loss of both.</P>
<P>This, <HI>he said,</HI> was dancing in a Circle; for so the <HI>Farthings</HI> might buy <HI>Threepences,</HI> and the <HI>Threepences</HI> buy <HI>Farthings,</HI> to the end of the Chap∣ter; which neither made one way or other, the Substance being the same, and the Species the same also; but the Loss was not till the End.</P>
<P>But then I objected, that he plac'd the Redu∣ction at <HI>15 d. per</HI> Pound on <HI>Copper,</HI> which was at best, but at <HI>14 d. He answer'd,</HI> That was stated to make good the Example, and not to determine the Value; but that the Case was still equal; for that neither were those <HI>Threepences</HI> worth <HI>2 d.</HI> each; and if I insisted upon that, he might put the Case upon the <HI>Rapps,</HI> another scandalous Fo∣reign Coin, which went current in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
upon the <HI>Scots Bodles,</HI> and <HI>Baubees,</HI> both which went current in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> and were, tho' <HI>Copper,</HI> considerably lighter, and less worth, than the <HI>New Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> coin'd by Friend <HI>William Wood,</HI> as he call'd him.</P>
<P>I cou'd not deny the Force of this Argu∣ment, nor cou'd I avoid the Consequence of it; which he had laid down thus:</P>
<P>If then, <HI>said he,</HI> this <HI>New Copper Coin</HI> be pur∣chas'd with another <HI>Coin</HI> equally deficient, which yet is current in the same Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> then <HI>Ireland</HI> can lose nothing by the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> because 'tis evident, they wou'd only supply the Place of Foreign Coins, and prevent the Encrease, which are already receiv'd at a like Loss, and which if the <HI>Copper Money</HI> did not come in, wou'd daily encrease, the Want of small Mo∣ney appearing to grow greater and greater in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Having gone through this Part of his Argu∣ment, which he enlarg'd much more upon, than I have room here to give an Account of, I press'd him to enter upon his Second Article, which, <HI>he said,</HI> was so significant, and which I seem'd to wonder so much at; and I promis'd him my Attention, being, <HI>as indeed I was,</HI> impatient to hear his Explanation of what I thought was so mysterious: So he repeated the whole Article; for I am not afraid <HI>said he,</HI> or doubtful that I shall not make it out to <HI>thy</HI> Satisfaction: The Article is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
First, <HI>he said,</HI> he laid it as a Foundation, that <HI>Friend Wood, so he call'd the Patentee,</HI> shou'd sell his <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> for Manufactures ei∣ther of Wool or Flax, as he told me he had offer'd to do for some Part of them.</P>
<P><HI>I reply'd,</HI> I knew that Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> intended to do so, and that if he did not immediately exchange the the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> for Linnen and Wool∣len Manufactures, he was such a Friend to the Commerce of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had resolv'd to encou∣rage it so much, that he resolv'd to vest a great Part of the Species he receiv'd for them in those Goods, and to Ship the same for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, <HI>he said;</HI> then he undertook to prove that for all those <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> which should be so vested in Woollen or Linnen Manu∣factures of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be carry'd out of the King∣dom, whether to <HI>England,</HI> or the <HI>West-Indies, Ireland</HI> shou'd gain considerably, tho' the said <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were immediately melted again, and reduc'd into <HI>Copper</HI> Metal.</P>
<P>I listen'd earnestly to this Discourse, and waited the Demonstration; which he began thus:</P>
<P>Previous, <HI>said he,</HI> to the Computations and Schemes that may be necessary to explain this Article, <HI>thou</HI> must grant me one just Distinction; <HI>namely,</HI> That we are not now speaking of the Profit or Loss accruing to this or that private Person in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in any Part of what may be spoken of about
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> but of the Pro∣fit or Loss to the publick Stock of <HI>Ireland</HI> as a Nation.</P>
<P><HI>For Example,</HI> First, <HI>he said,</HI> the Value of any Product form'd by the Industry of the Peo∣ple, was of no real Advantage to, and did not encrease the publick Stock of the Coun∣try, if that Product was not sent away, and exported out of the Kingdom; for as to what was consum'd at-home, whatever was gain'd by the several Artificers and Manu∣facturers thro' whose Hands it pass'd, was lost again in his Hands who was the last Consumer, and so the general Stock re∣main'd the same.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of those Manufactures which are export∣ed, no Part can be esteem'd a Diminution of the publick Stock, but the first Princi∣ples of the Manufacture, all the rest is Gain to the Stock; and consequently what∣ever is return'd, or paid for it, is clear Pro∣fit to the publick Stock of the Country.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>says he,</HI> for Example, If a Pound of Wool, costing 3 <HI>d.</HI> by various Improvements, arrives to the Value of 5 <HI>s.</HI> in Manufactures (as it is ma∣fest in some Manufactures, it will double that Value,) and if then <HI>thy Friend Wood</HI> gives two Pound of <HI>Copper Halfpence,</HI> value 5 <HI>s.</HI> for this Pound of Wool manufactur'd, tho' this two Pound of <HI>Halfpence</HI> be immediately melted, and reduc'd into <HI>Copper</HI> Metal, and sold for 14 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, which is 2 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> the publick Stock of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> gains two Shillings and one Penny by the Exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
I confess I was confounded at this Computa∣tion, and at first did not readily apprehend it, wherefore <HI>I ask'd him,</HI> what came of the almost numberless Families of Handicrafts, Labourers, and Manufacturers employ'd in bringing the Ma∣nufacture so wrought from the Fleece to the Merchandize.</P>
<P>Become of them? <HI>said he,</HI> they are all paid by one another; what they earn, they spend; it circulates from one to another; they gain by Work, the eat, and lose it again, and still 'tis within ourselves; the publick Stock neither en∣creases or decreases by that; but the <HI>Copper</HI> which <HI>thy</HI> Friend brings in, leave 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> of solid un∣consumable Metal in Specie in the Kingdom, more than the 3 <HI>d.</HI> which it carried away.</P>
<P>This 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> is a real Value, it will go to <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> or any-where, and exchange itself into Gold or Silver, if you please, and come home as valuable as it went out, and will never diminish, unless lost by some subsequent Conduct, to which this has no relation.</P>
<P>I had not one Word to say against this, nor can I since, tho' I have propos'd it to several in the very same terms which the QUAKER sta∣ted it to me; <HI>I say,</HI> I cannot meet with one sub∣stantial Objection against it, so I leave it for any one to confute, who think they can confute it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
But now FRIEND, <HI>says my</HI> QUAKER, I have not done with <HI>thee</HI> yet; my next Question is, If the Profit to the publick Stock be thus great, under the unnecessary Supposition of a Reduction of the <HI>Copper Coin</HI> to its meer first Prin∣ciples, what an immense Gain to the publick Stock of <HI>Ireland</HI> must it be, if this Coin re∣mains current; for tho' it is true, simply consi∣der'd, that it is of no more Value than the 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> to which it may be reduc'd, yet it is really a Loan to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> of 2 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> more, in every 5 <HI>s.</HI> current Cash, which Loan it supplies the Nation with, for the Convenience of its Commerce, without any Interest; and if there shou'd be the Value of 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> in Far∣things thus made current for any Number of Years, the Advantage of this in Trade is scarce to be computed, seeing it is capable (always sug∣gesting it to be laid out in Manufactures) of keeping the Poor of the whole Kingdom em∣ploy'd, and consuming the Product in a foreign Nation.</P>
<P>And this is the Foundation, <HI>added he,</HI> on which, <HI>I said before, and say it now,</HI> let <HI>Ireland</HI> pay Interest for this Loan, to the <HI>Patentee,</HI> but at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the <HI>Patentee</HI> may oblige himself, his Executors, Ad∣ministrators, and Assigns, at any time after thir∣ty Years, to call these <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> all in, and pay for them at the full Rate as <HI>Far∣things</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> or let them be melted down in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and pay the Difference.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
I listen'd to this Part too, with Attention, tho' it seem'd to be but a Speculation; but upon ex∣amining it, I cou'd not deny the Fact, or find a∣ny Falacy in the reasoning Part.</P>
<P>My QUAKER seeing me silent, began to smile at me; and now my Friend, <HI>said he,</HI> what Occasion has here been for such a plentiful Show∣er of Railery at King <HI>George,</HI> and his Govern∣ment in <HI>England?</HI> or at the Ministers of State? or at <HI>Friend Wood? Thou</HI> seest the World is im∣pos'd upon in the Matter.</P>
<P>Really, <HI>says I, thou</HI> hast made it so plain to me, I think they have been impos'd upon indeed; 'tis true, I thought so before, but I cou'd not make it out so clearly as I can now.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said he,</HI> I am glad thou art convinc'd at last; but now shall I ask <HI>thee</HI> a Question or two about what I hear since I came to <HI>Eng∣land?</HI> for <HI>thou, says he,</HI> may'st perhaps, know more of that Part than I do, or, <HI>at least, thou</HI> can'st, as a Piece of News, tell me whether it be true or not.</P>
<P>What are your Questions, <HI>says I?</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>says he,</HI> one of my Questions is this: I understand it has been desir'd of our King, by some People, that he shou'd issue out his Pro∣clamation to forbid the taking these <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I interrupted him there, <HI>and told him,</HI> I be∣liev'd that was his Mistake, and that, as I was
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
inform'd, it was only an Application or Address to the King, to command his Officers and Re∣ceivers of the Revenue, not to take them in Payment.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says he,</HI> even what <HI>thou</HI> say'st, is the same thing in a lesser Degree, but I do not mean that; but as I said to <HI>thee,</HI> I have been inform'd, that some People have endeavour'd, or resolv'd to endeavour, to obtain a Proclamation to com∣mand the People not to take them; or, <HI>added he,</HI> to speak in <HI>thy</HI> Country Way in the like Cases, <HI>to cry them down.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I,</HI> and what do you infer from that?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>said he,</HI> I wou'd ask <HI>thee</HI> a Question upon that Subject: Whether wou'd it not be as arbitrary and illegal to have commanded us not to have pass'd them as current, and not to take them in Payment as current Money, as it wou'd have been to have commanded them to pass cur∣rent by virtue of the King's Prerogative?</P>
<P><HI>I answer'd,</HI> If the Coinage was the King's by Right, and by Prerogative, as he had granted, it cou'd not have been arbitrary either <HI>to cry them up,</HI> or <HI>cry them down;</HI> but both had been in the King's Power to do, without any Com∣plaint justly lying against it.</P>
<P><HI>He said,</HI> I did not keep to the <HI>Terms</HI> of his <HI>Que∣stion;</HI> he did not question the Prerogative of the King, <HI>one way or other;</HI> it was none of his Business or Intention so much as to meddle with it; but
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
his Question was, Whether one was not as much an Act of Tyranny, or Arbitrary Power, as the other?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> Yes, without Question they were equally arbitrary, or equally rightful.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>says he,</HI> with what Assurance must those Men act, who cou'd first censure the <HI>Pa∣tent</HI> as an illegal Grant, and an arbitrary putting the <HI>Copper Coin</HI> upon the People, tho' it was not impos'd upon them neither, and yet cou'd desire the King to impose the Negative upon them; for it must be, that as the <HI>Patent</HI> leaving the Peo∣ple free, they had certainly a Right to refuse them, as well as to take them; so certainly they are still free, and have a Right to take them, as well as refuse them.</P>
<P>Besides, <HI>he added,</HI> that he thought we went all upon a wrong Argument here in another Case, for want of distinguishing rightly of the thing; for, <HI>says he,</HI> the Grant to <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> does not exert the Prerogative of the King, as is usual in all Grants, and Patents of this Kind, and that relate to the Coin.</P>
<P><HI>Then he told me,</HI> That, <HI>as he had said before,</HI> there had been several Grants of this Kind be∣fore this; and the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had given the <HI>Copper</HI> Coinage to particular Persons be∣fore now, by <HI>Patent,</HI> and that in <HI>England</HI> in par∣ticular; nor was it ever esteem'd to be arbitrary or illegal to declare them current.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
But that in this Grant the King having with an unusual Tenderness to his People, left it in their Choice, whether to take them, or refuse them, they were to be therefore distinguish'd from the general Coinage of the King's Domi∣nions, and were rather a Merchandize than a Coin; and if so, <HI>says he, I</HI> do not see upon what Foundation those Men cou'd proceed, who in∣tended to move the King (if any did do so) to <HI>cry them down by Proclamation,</HI> seeing, <HI>says he,</HI> eve∣ry Man is free, and it is the undoubted Property of the People, if they have any Property at-all, to deal in, buy and sell any Goods and Merchan∣dize whatsoever, if not prohibited, and made contraband by Law.</P>
<P>These <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> then, <HI>he said,</HI> are nothing but a certain Quantity of <HI>Copper</HI> Me∣tal sold in small Pieces, and which the King has given Leave to the Proprietor of them to stamp with a certain Mark, by which they may be par∣ticularly known, and the Value of them ascer∣tain'd; we are not bound so much, <HI>added he,</HI> as to know them by their Names, but they are carried to Market as coin'd <HI>Copper</HI> Metal, and if any will buy them, as no doubt they have a Right to do, <HI>well and good;</HI> then <HI>Wm. Wood, thy</HI> Friend, who is the Proprietor, sells them, as he and the People can agree; if they will not buy, he must keep them till they will buy, or other∣wise dispose of them as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>And just thus, <HI>says he,</HI> it is in this very Coun∣try of <HI>England,</HI> for I need not carry <HI>thee</HI> out of
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
<HI>thy</HI> Knowledge for an Example; and then he brought a most clever compleat Parallel from the Block-Tin in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> The Tin in <HI>Corn∣wall, he said,</HI> was as much <HI>a Coin</HI> as my Friend <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and my Friend <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> as much a Merchandize as the Blocks of Tin in <HI>Cornwall;</HI> they are both, <HI>says he,</HI> the Property of private Persons, yet both are stamp'd with the several Marks and Inscriptions, which are se∣verally appointed by the King's Authority; the Standard of both their Weight and Fineness, <HI>adds he,</HI> are likewise adjusted and settled by the same Authority, and the Works are equally call'd by the same Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Coinage.</P>
<P>The Blocks of Tin are brought to the several <HI>Stanuary Towns</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI> appointed for the Coinage of Tin, and there by the King's Offi∣cers they are essay'd and coin'd; nor, <HI>adds he,</HI> do I put the Word <HI>Coin'd</HI> upon them, but 'tis call'd so there upon the Spot; and when they are thus coin'd, the Goodness and Fineness of the Metal being first ascertain'd, and then the Blocks are current, <HI>that is,</HI> they are carried to Market, and any-body may buy them that please.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>he told me,</HI> it was with Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Coinage; <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood, says he,</HI> does no more, his <HI>Copper</HI> is brought to <HI>Bristol,</HI> which is his <HI>Sta∣nuary Town,</HI> or Place of Coinage, there they are form'd into such Pieces as the Market calls for, and there the Metal is essay'd, and the Value of it ascertain'd by proper Persons; then
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
it is stamp'd, and such Marks and Inscriptions made upon them as is directed by the King's Authority; <HI>and what then?</HI> Why then 'tis a cur∣rent Merchandize, and 'tis carry'd to <HI>Ireland</HI> to Market, where any-body may buy them that please.</P>
<P>This Consideration, <HI>he said,</HI> gave the People a Right to buy them, and as <HI>Copper,</HI> in whatever Shape, was not prohibited in <HI>Ireland,</HI> none cou'd be forbid admitting them to be imported, unless they were so prohibited by Law, or be forbid∣den to buy them and sell them, when they were imported, and that when, and as often, and at what Price or Value the Buyer and Seller cou'd agree for.</P>
<P>And by the same Rule, <HI>says he,</HI> these, or any other Goods of the like Nature, may be made current by the common Consent of the People in any other Part of the King's Dominions; and here he enter'd into a very fine and ingenious Discourse upon the great Ease with which a coin'd Merchandize might (the King consent∣ing) be made current in all the distant Parts of the King's Dominions, with due Calculations and Allowances for the intrinsick Value of the Materials, and for the Proportions to the Rates of Exchange, or the Loss and Gain in the inter∣course of Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and all the said distant Places respectively.</P>
<P>But when I was big with Expectations for his en∣larging on so <HI>agreeable</HI> and so <HI>improving</HI> a <HI>Subject,</HI> he turn'd it back again to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Subject we
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
were upon before, in this pleasant and usual man∣ner; I am not going, <HI>says he,</HI> to carry <HI>thee</HI> off of <HI>thy</HI> Argument, to follow my Notions, which per∣haps are out of <HI>thy</HI> Way, I bring it back to the Case in hand, <HI>says he,</HI> and to the Proportions in this Coinage of <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and it wou'd not be amiss, <HI>said he,</HI> to enlarge a little upon the Argument, how well the Value is pro∣portion'd and calculated to the Rate of Ex∣change, either to <HI>England,</HI> or between <HI>Ireland</HI> and any other Country in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It may not, <HI>said I,</HI> be so much out of my Way as you imagine, to talk of proportioning a petty Coinage for other Places besides <HI>Ireland;</HI> on the contrary, <HI>said I,</HI> I shall be very glad to hear you talk on that Subject too, because I fancy you have spent some Thoughts that Way.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>he said,</HI> he had, but it was too conside∣rable a Subject to enter into at present, and he wou'd give me an Hour or two by itself on that Part, when I wou'd; but <HI>he said,</HI> he cou'd not give up this Case of the <HI>Copper</HI> Money in <HI>Ireland,</HI> without observing one thing more, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Proportions between the current and the intrin∣sick Value were so well calculated and adjusted, that notwithstanding all that had been objected in Publick, and in Private, yet there was a nearer Proportion in the <HI>Copper</HI> Money, than in any o∣ther Foreign Species of Money that were current at that time in the Kingdom; I mean a Propor∣tion, <HI>says he,</HI> to the Value of Exchanges from other Countries; and that a Foreign Bill of Ex∣change made payable at <HI>Dublin,</HI> wou'd much
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
better be Paid in <HI>Copper Farthings,</HI> than in <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or any other Money, except only in <HI>English</HI> Guineas; and, <HI>he added,</HI> that there was a greater Weight of Argument lay upon this Part, than I was yet aware of; but this also we agreed to adjourn.</P>
<P><HI>He then concluded with telling me,</HI> He hop'd he might say, that the King and the Ministers of State in <HI>England</HI> know the State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> so well, and were so heartily concern'd for the publick Good of the Kingdom, that he was in great Hopes they shou'd not be depriv'd of the Advantage of this small Coinage, which, <HI>says he,</HI> if we shou'd, it wou'd be an infinite Dis∣advantage to our Commerce.</P>
<P>We had a great-deal of Discourse more of this Kind, but I have not room to give any farther Account of it at this Time.</P>
