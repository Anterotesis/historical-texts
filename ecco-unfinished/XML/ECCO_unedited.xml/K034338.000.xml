<HEAD>DEDICATION. To DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE attention, with which you have been pleased to distinguish this inconsiderable production, makes it a duty with me to lay it at your feet. The applauses of the Theatre gave me assurance of its success, but it was your testimony alone, which could inspire me with any opinion of its merit: Nor is it on this occasion only I am to thank you; in whatever proportion I have been happy enough to attract the regards of the public, in the same degree I have never failed being honoured with your's.</P>
<P>How I have merited these marks of your partiality I am not able to guess: I can take my conscience to witness, I have paid you no sacrifice, devoted no time or study to your service, nor am a man in any respect qualified to repay your favors: Give me credit, there∣fore, when I tell you, that your liberality oppresses me. Was I apt to rate my pretensions highly, and presume upon the indulgence of the public, I might have some claim to your favor; but 'till you hear me complain that my reward is not equal to my merit, I pray you let me enjoy my content and my obscurity.</P>
<P>At the same time that I would gladly withdraw my∣self from your notice, I have no one in my eye whom I would wish to recommend to it: It is my desire to put you at your ease, worn out as you must needs be with the toils of your employment; and I seriously protest to you, that if your silence will be the conse∣quence of mine, I am ready to enter with you into ar∣ticles whenever you think fit; convinced that I can never benefit mankind so much as by procuring you a lasting repose; nor would you be long to seek for a retreat; there are many market-towns in the country
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
where you may drink your tea in quiet with a reput∣able set of elderly maidens at a distance from the ca∣pital. Above all things I should humbly recommend it to you, to relieve yourself from your labours in the dramatic walk: Consider, Sir, the campaign is now opening; I understand it will be an active one; new competitors will be pressing forward in the field of fame; I could wish you to keep out of their way; enervated as you are by past excesses, you will be ill able to struggle with these young and maiden spirits; but if you must engage, let it, I pray you, be with some of your intimates, if you find any on the ground; and do not pursue those ministerial politics, hitherto adopt∣ed by you, of bestowing all your favours on your op∣posers, and letting your friends go without their re∣ward.</P>
<P>Whilst I am consulting your future repose, do not think I am unmindful of your past renown: It is to you alone, <HI>Most mighty Sir,</HI> we owe the great encrease of <HI>news-papers</HI> (not to mention <HI>magazines, reviews,</HI> &amp;c.) in this metropolis. In former times, the world was contented with a stale recital of <HI>foreign and domestic occurrences,</HI> which never came to pass, and a lame ac∣count of <HI>casualties,</HI> where no mischief was ever done; now the reader is convey'd under your auspices to the foot of the throne; you have the key that admits him into the cabinets of all the princes in Europe; nay, you can carry him a dance thro' the air, as familiarly as the lame devil did the scholar of Salamanca, and uncover the roofs of our closets and chambers to his view: The world is not only supplied with a faithful history of the times in our public prints, but every private family, thro' your means, may meet its own s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cret <HI>Atalantis.</HI> These are advantages, which some people of confined notions have not clearly understood, and have rashly proceeded to oppose the tyrranny of the law against the freedom of the press; pains and penal∣ties have been inflicted, mulcts and imprisonments have been put in force against the conductors of your undertaking; but, thanks to our excellent constitu∣tion, you still enjoy your full liberty, though many of your partisans are abridg'd of theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
The personal, political and literary characters of men are the three great branches of your study; emi∣nent have been your researches in each; but it is not within the compass of this dedication to follow you thro' any but the latter, and that in the dramatic di∣vision only: And here I observe your ordinary prac∣tice hath been as follows:</P>
<P>When any play, like this now submitted to the pub∣lic, meets a favourable reception on its first appearance, the very next morning by break of day out comes your manifesto; unravels the whole plot and contri∣vance of the drama, dissects the characters, detects the plagiarisms, and kindly tells the town what it is to expect; and all this is the dark operation of one midnight hour, while the poor romantic author lies wrapt perhaps in golden dreams of happiness and suc∣cess: The consequence of this manifesto is, the clear∣ing up of many mistakes which the public would else be apt to make: They who have been pleas'd, being told they ought not to have been pleas'd, go no more and avoid an error in judgement; they who would have gone, stay at home and save their money; the per∣formers, whom success might have made giddy, are now prevented from over-acting their several parts, and seasonably kept down; the author, whom the plaudits of a theatre might have intoxicated to that phrenzy of sensibility, in which we are told that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philippides quoque Comaediarum poeta baud ignobilis, quum in certamine poetarum, praeter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isset, et loetissimè gauderet, inter illud gaudium repente mortuus est.</HI> AULUS GELLIUS iii. xv.</NOTE> <HI>Philippides the comic poet</HI> expired, is kept in due regimen, and under no danger of losing the moderate share of senses you allow him: Thus you stand, like the admonishing slave in the triumph, to remind the conqueror that <HI>he is a man;</HI> if therefore the shouts of the people are loud, you hallow in his ear, so as to be heard above the cry; if they are moderate, you whisper; but where the people are silent, the admonition is unnecessary; and whenever your own friends mount the carr, your delicacy in their instance is conspicuous, by the pro∣found taciturnity you observe.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
In the instance of the present imperfect performance (thus laid at your feet) I have had opportunity to ex∣perience your concern for me in a peculiar manner: Ill-health, and other melancholy attentions, which I need not explain to you, kept me at a distance from the scene of its decision; on this occasion you redoub∣led your admonitions, apprehensive, no doubt, that I should give way to the flattering report of my friends, and fearful that I should yield to that weakness, of which the mind, when under the visitation of affliction, is evidently most susceptible.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only error I might have fallen into▪ I must confess to you I had vainly flatter'd myself with the design of addressing this Comedy not to you, <HI>High and Mighty Sir,</HI> but to an amiable and elegant friend, to a lady whose criticisms under favour differ as widely from your's, as <HI>Shakespeare</HI> does from the author of the <HI>Choleric Man:</HI> This lady, Sir, (whose name I forbear to mention, as it is unknown to you) was called upon in defence of a countryman to enter the lists, tho' the mildest of human beings, with the renowned <HI>Voltaire</HI> (I do not disguise his name from you, because I think on certain subjects, especially where Christianity is concerned, you have sometimes taken part with him): The spectators of the combat gave the victory to the lady; the action is recorded in pure English; but if you please to turn to the par∣ticulars of the attack, which was on her side, you will find it conducted upon principles so opposite to your own, that you will probably differ in opinion from the rest of mankind and give your palm to her antagonist: You I know would have proceeded according to all the rules of modern finesse; sapping, undermining and blowing up; working like a mole out of sight, and over-turning all things in confusion and ruin; she, in the spirit of ancient times, carried on her ap∣proaches in open day-light and above ground, com∣bating with such weapons only, as <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> had put into her hands under the plain guidance and direction of her own wit and judgement. To this <HI>lady,</HI> in pure affection and esteem, I had purposed to have inscribed this Comedy; but when you told me
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
it was not worthy even of my poor genius, how could I suppose it a fit tribute to her's? She will therefore in the simple phrase accept the will for the deed; and if she should chance upon refusal to dissent from the opinion you have given in the case, I must beseech her to distrust herself, and to believe there is one quality, very apt to mislead and be misled, which she possesses in a greater degree (if possible) than either wit or judgement, and that is called (pardon my introducing it into your presence) <HI>Benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>How ridiculous should I have made myself, if, fol∣lowing the false lights of popular applause, I had pre∣sented this <HI>heterogeneous</HI> piece (as you are pleased to call it) to one, whose genius might have merited the ori∣ginal from whence it pretends to be derived; not the <HI>'Squire of Alsatia</HI> I mean, but the <HI>Adelphi of Terence:</HI> With respect to the above-mentioned <HI>'Squire,</HI> which I understand is the offspring of <HI>Mr. Shadwell,</HI> if I have ignorantly robb'd him of any part of his patrimony, I hope it will not be imputed to me; for I do seriously declare that to my knowledge I never saw him, or ever had any commerce or acquaintance with him, or knew, 'till you informed me, that he had so respecta∣ble a father: It is to you therefore, <HI>ingenious Sir,</HI> I am indebted for the discovery that I have lost sight of an original which I pretended to have copied, and copied one which I really never saw.</P>
<P>But I would beg leave humbly to observe that the plot of <HI>Terence</HI> was never in my contemplation; it re∣quires the genius of <HI>Mr. Mason</HI> to make the Grecian simplicity live on our stage; I dare not attempt it even at your command; but if you wish to have it tried, go to your <HI>Terence,</HI> you will find it ingeniously and ably translated, and bring his <HI>Brother</HI> on the theatre; I fear even my illegitimate race, if tried by a jury of English freeholders, will oust the representative of the heir apparent, nay the very heir himself, if he was to come in his own person to assert his right.</P>
<P><HI>Atbens</HI> and <HI>London, Most Mighty Sir,</HI> cannot as I conceive be easily compared: In your department I am apprised how much advantage dwells with the latter; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n mine we are grievously worsted: I have ventured
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
to hint to you in the dull <HI>prologue</HI> I have presin'd, that there were at least fifty comic poets flourishing at one period in <HI>Athens,</HI> and most of these lived to write more plays than all our fraternity now alive put to∣gether; tho' you I believe may think some of us have already written more than enough. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scripsit</HI> (sc Menander) <HI>Suidâ teste</HI> 80 <HI>Comaedias, vel secundum alios</HI> 180, <HI>qui etiam a Terentio conversas esse omnesq. intercidisse asserunt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Menander, learn∣ed Sir,</HI> you well know is said to have written 80, or according to some, 180 Comedies, and that they were all translated by <HI>Terence;</HI> but if we take the testimony of <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ex istis tamen centum et quinque omnibus, folis eum (sc Menan∣drum) octo vicisse idem Apollodorus codem in libro scripsit.</HI> A GILL. xvii. iv.</NOTE> <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> the number will amount according to his computation to 105, and the same authority tells us that out of these 105 Comedies, <HI>Menander</HI> carried away but eight prizes, while <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Euripidem quo{que} M Varro ait, quum quinque et septuaginta tra∣gaedias scripserit in quinque solis vicisse.</NOTE> <HI>Euripides,</HI> as <HI>Varro</HI> informs us, on the other hand, out of 75 Tragedies was victorious only in five. These instances will suffice to give us some idea of the comparative state of genius in the two places and periods.</P>
<P>Amongst all these plays and all these poets, which the Athenian stage can boast, I should doubt if you could have found half the employment which our scanty fraternity at home afford you: Be pleased, <HI>learned Sir,</HI> to try your skill upon any one of <HI>Aristo∣phanes</HI>'s comedies; take his <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Clouds</HI> for instance; if you was literally in the clouds you could not be more to seek; and unless Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Carter</HI> will take you by the hand (and how that should be I don't know) you will never get thro' the fog—Turn over a Fragment of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philemon lived in the time of Alexander the Great; he was a writer of the</HI> New Comedy, <HI>and is said by Suidas to have written ninety plays.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Philemon;</HI> what do you think of it? Write a column in the news-papers upon it; is it not as <HI>heterogeneous</HI> a thing as the <HI>Choleric Man?</HI> Cast your eye over those passages of <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diphilus was also a writer of the</HI> New Comedy; <HI>he wrote</HI> 100 <HI>plays, and some of these it is said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> copied by Plantus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Diphilus;</HI> do you see no

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esemblance to the <HI>'Squire of Alsatia?</HI> It was as well known to <HI>Diphilus,</HI> as it is to me.</P>
<P>But there remains a word to be said on some learned animadversions of your's, entitled <HI>An Essay on the Theatre,</HI> in which you profess to draw a <HI>Comparison between Laughing</HI> and <HI>Sentimental Comedy;</HI> and in which you are pleased evidently to point some observations at my comedy of the <HI>Fashionable Lover:</HI> You insinu∣ate that every blockhead can write <HI>Sentimental or pa∣thetic Comedy;</HI> that <HI>Terence</HI> appears to have made the <HI>nearest approaches,</HI> tho' without confounding the diffe∣rent provinces; and yet that he is reproached by <HI>Caesar</HI> for wanting the <HI>vis comica;</HI> but <HI>that all the other comic writers of antiquity</HI> take the walk of ridi∣cule, and cautiously avoid incroaching on the confines of tragedy; nay that <HI>Terence</HI> himself judiciously stops short before he comes to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Terence seems to have made the nearest Approaches, yet always judiciously stops short before he comes to the</HI> downwright pathetic; <HI>and yet he is even reproached by Caesar for wanting the</HI> Vis comica. <HI>All the other comic writers of antiquity aim only at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endering folly or vice ridiculous, but never exalt their characters into buskin'd pomp, or make what Voltaire humorously calls a tradesman's tragedy.</HI> ANONY.</NOTE> <HI>downright</HI> pathetic.</P>
<P>By this specimen of your acquaintance with the <HI>comic writers of antiquity, most learned Sir,</HI> I suspect that from the great attention you have bestowed upon the moderns, you have had little to spare to their pre∣decessors; for if it is your opinion that <HI>Terence</HI> of all the ancient comic poets made the <HI>nearest approaches</HI> to the <HI>pathetic,</HI> I fear you will have an host of authorities to combat? <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">To <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thos <HI>nulli alii servare convenit quam Titinnio et Terentio;</HI> Pathe <HI>vero Trabea et Attilius et Caecilius facilè moverant.</HI> (Varr. de Lat. Sermone.)</NOTE> <HI>Varro</HI> decrees the province of the <HI>Manners</HI> to <HI>Titinnlus</HI> and <HI>Terence;</HI> but that of the <HI>Pa∣thetic</HI> to <HI>Trabea, Attilius</HI> and <HI>Caecilius:</HI> You have here three comic poets of the Roman stage, all of which, according to the testimony of <HI>Varro</HI> the most learned of the Romans, <HI>approached</HI> nearer to the <HI>pathetic</HI> than <HI>Terence.</HI> But let us hear the opinion of <HI>C. Caesar</HI> in this question, to whom you refer us, and tell us
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
that he <HI>reproach'd Terence</HI> for being deficient in the <HI>vis comica,</HI> and this no doubt because he had such leanings, such <HI>approaches to the pathetic:</HI> The lines, which convey this <HI>reproach</HI> will be found below in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><L><HI>Tu quoque tu in sumnis, O dimidiate Menander,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Poneris, et meritò, puri sermonis amator;</HI></L>

<L><HI>Cum Graecis, neque in hâc despectus parte jaceres,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.</HI></L></NOTE> note; they appear to me to be expressive of a most tender affection and respect to the memory of a favourite author; and I wish, <HI>illustrious Sir,</HI> you would think so well of them as to convey your <HI>reproaches</HI> in the like terms; my brethren would not complain, and I should be a great gainer. But let us consider these expressions of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s; I do not discover any allusion to the <HI>pathetic:</HI> He calls him <HI>puri sermonis amator;</HI> and this indeed accords with <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Quidquid come loquens ac omnia dulcia dicens.</NOTE> <HI>Cicero</HI>'s description; but I am apt to think that neither in this expression, nor in that of <HI>Lenibus Scriptis</HI> any reference is made to the <HI>pathetic,</HI> and I am strengthened in this opinion by an observation of <HI>Tanaquillus Faber</HI> on this very pas∣sage: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nempe hoc sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bat Terentium in movendis</HI> pathefin <HI>inforiorem quibusdanm poet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s esse, quod profecto verum est, et judicium Caesaris sen∣tentiâ Varronis, qui Romanorum doctissimus fuit confirmatur.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Caesar thought</HI> (says the commentator) <HI>that Torence, in moving the passions, was inferior to some others, which indeed is the case; and Caesar's opinion is confirmed by the decree of Varro, the most learned of the Romans.</HI> This truly is to the point, if we are to cre∣dit the authority above-mentioned; and he proceeds to say, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vides</HI> to ethos <HI>Terentio relictum, nil aliud:</HI> To pathos, <HI>quod vim et impetum postulat, praeserlim in genere comico, aliis concedi.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Thus you see that nothing is left to Terence but The Manners: The Pathetic, which requires force and energy, especially in the comic province, is ascribed to others.</HI> By this reference you see we have not only gained an authority for my interpretation of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s words, but we have sound a learned critic, who is
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
hardy enough to assert, that the <HI>pathetic</HI> is the very effence of the <HI>vis comica,</HI> or in other words, <HI>requires force and energy, especially</HI> in <HI>the comic province;</HI> the very opposite doctrine to what you, <HI>most learned Sir,</HI> have maintained.</P>
<P>So much for <HI>Terence;</HI> as for <HI>all the other Comic Writers of antiquity,</HI> I am at a loss to know whether you refer to the whole bulk of them in general, mean∣ing all such of whose writings we have any fragments or descriptions; or whether you mean <HI>all the others,</HI> whose plays have come down to us entire; or in other words, <HI>all the two,</HI> viz. <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and <HI>Plantus—</HI>But we will take a short examination of the case.</P>
<P>If you mean to refer generally to the bulk of Greek and Roman writers of comedy, the question is in part answer'd by <HI>Varro,</HI> (as above quoted) who declares that <HI>Trabea, Attilius</HI> and <HI>Caecilius</HI> excelled in <HI>sentimental</HI> or <HI>pathetic</HI> comedy: This will satisfy us as to the Roman stage; the Greek theatre, being original, was more various: Comedy took different characters at different periods: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vetus Comoedia.</NOTE> <HI>The Ancient Comedy</HI> was personal and licentious, for then the government of <HI>Athens</HI> was democratical; <HI>Aristophanes, Cratinus, Eupolis, Phere∣crates,</HI> and many others rank under this department; they lash'd the vices of mankind with singular severity; the generals, judges, treasurers, the people themselves, nay the most illustrious and most virtuous citizens were not exempt from their satire. Their invectives however were frequently resented; <HI>Eupolis</HI> in par∣ticular was cast into the sea and drowned, either be∣cause he had satyriz'd the <HI>Baptae,</HI> in his comedy so call'd, or at the command of <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> whom he had lampooned. This circumstance and the transition of power from the people to the nobles introduced that species of comedy call'd <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Media.</NOTE> <HI>The Middle;</HI> of this sort we are told was the <HI>Aeolosicon</HI> of <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> the <HI>Ulysses</HI> of <HI>Cratinus,</HI> and many others, which contain no personal invective, but have for the object of their
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
ridicule certain passages in, or allusions to, the ancient poets, or parodies and travesties upon the eminent <HI>tragedies;</HI> thus <HI>Cratinus</HI> in the comedy above men∣tioned ridicules the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and thus the transition was made from person to performance, much to the advantage of society: Your transitions, <HI>learned Sir,</HI> on the contrary, are often from performance to person. This however is certain that the writers of the <HI>ancient</HI> or <HI>middle comedy</HI> made few, if any, <HI>approaches</HI> towards the <HI>pathetic,</HI> and so far your assertion is well sounded.</P>
<P>But in the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nova—Novae Comoediae Menander fuit facilè princeps.</NOTE> <HI>new comedy,</HI> of which <HI>Menander</HI> is at the head, the case is widely different; the Wits of <HI>Athens</HI> became exceedingly cautious how they in∣dulged their vein for satire, least by any means their invective might be applied to any of the <HI>Maccdonian</HI> princes, late <HI>Alexander</HI>'s generals, of whose power they stood in extream awe. <HI>Comedy</HI> now assumed an aspect entirely different; the fragments of <HI>Menander, Philemon, Diphilus, Posidippus,</HI> <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">The H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cyra and Phormio of Terence are said, by Donatus, to be taken from Apollodorus.</NOTE> <HI>Apollodorus Gelous,</HI> and others, consist of moral sententious passages, elegant in their phrase, but grave, and many of them, especially those of <HI>Diphilus,</HI> of a religious cast, as may be seen by refering to them.</P>
<P>Numberless quotations might be adduced to prove this to have been the character and complexion of the <HI>new comedy</HI> under <HI>Menander</HI> and his fraternity; <HI>Quintilian</HI> says of <HI>Menander</HI> that he is <HI>omnibus rebus, personis,</HI> affectubus <HI>accommodotus.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>And now, Sir, having addressed you under your general title, do not believe that I mean to mark you out by any particular one: Your correspondence with me, you well know, has always been <HI>anonymous,</HI> ex∣cept in the case of one unhappy gentleman, and he has fled his country. As for you, Sir, wherever you inhabit, and whatever is your fortune, I bear you no ill-will; my character I will keep out of your reach, and for my writings I shall not much differ in opinion from you about them: If you pursue the same studies with me, good luck attend you; give your own works a good word, and be silent about mine; for if it shall please the Giver of my life to spare it, I hope soon to present to my countrymen something more worthy of their approbation, and less dependent upon your's.</P>

<L><HI>Greece</HI> from her fall immortal triumphs drew,</L>

<L>She, goddess-like, confiding in her charms,</L>
<L>To <HI>Mars</HI> resign'd the barren toil of arms,</L>
<L>Full well assur'd, when these vain toils were past,</L>
<L>That wit must triumph over strength at last;</L>
<L>Then smiling saw her <HI>Athens</HI> meet its doom,</L>
<L>And crown'd her in the theatres of <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>Nor murmur'd <HI>Rome</HI> to see her <HI>Terence</HI> shod</L>
<L>With the same sock in which <HI>Menander</HI> trod,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Laelius</HI> scorn'd, nor <HI>Scipio</HI> blush'd to sit,</L>
<L>And join their plaudits to <HI>Athenian</HI> wit.</L>
<L><HI>Micio</HI>'s mild virtue and mad <HI>Demea</HI>'s rage,</L>
<L>With bursts alternate shook the echoing stage;</L>
<L>And from these models 'tis your poet draws</L>
<L>His best, his only hope of your applause.</L>
<L>A tale it is to chace that angry spleen,</L>
<L>Which forms the mirth and moral of his scene;</L>
<L>A tale for noble and ignoble ear,</L>
<L>Something for fathers and for sons to hear:</L>
<L>And should you on your humbler bard bestow,</L>
<L>That grace which <HI>Rome</HI> to her's was pleas'd to show,</L>
<L>Advantage with the modern fairly lies,</L>
<L>Who, less deserving, gains as great a prize.</L>

<L>AS <HI>I'm</HI> an <HI>Artist,</HI> can my skill do better,</L>

<L>I'll draw the out-lines—finish at my leisure,</L>

<L>Here is my pencil, here my sketching book,</L>

<L>I will in full, three quarters, and profile,</L>
<L>Take your sweet faces, nay, your thoughts I'll steal;</L>
<L>From my good friends above, their wives and doxies,</L>
<L>Down to <HI>Madame,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur,</HI> in the boxes:</L>
<L>Now for it, Sirs!—I beg from top to bottom,</L>
<L>You'll keep your features fix'd 'till I have got 'em.</L>
<L>First for <HI>Fine Gentlemen</HI> my fancy stretches—</L>
<L>They'll be more like, the slighter are the sketches:</L>
<L>Such unembodied form invention racks;</L>
<L>Pale cheeks, dead eyes, thin bodies, and long backs;</L>
<L>They would be best in shades, or virgin wax.</L>
<L>To make <HI>Fine Ladies</HI> like, the toil is vain,</L>
<L>Unless I paint 'em o'er and o'er again:</L>

<L>Hold up your head, your fat becomes you, Sir;</L>
<L>Leer with your eyes—as thus—now smirk—well done!</L>
<L>You're ogling, Sir—a haunch of venison.</L>

<P>Bless me! was the world of my mind, they would patch up their differences over a bottle, and let the grass grow in our Inns of court. Let me see—what have we got here?—<STAGE>(reads)</STAGE><HI>—A detects B plucking turnips out of his field,</HI> &amp;c.—Here's a fellow for you, he'll go to law with the Crows for picking worms out of his dunghill: Prosecute a fellow-creature for a turnip?

<P>A light guinea, Sir.</P>

<SP>

<P>'Tis more than a light woman deserves: Give the taylor his guinea again; bid him proceed to his work, and leave a good-for-nothing wife to go on with her's; and hark'ee, Frampton, you seem to want a new coat, suppose you let him take your measure; the fellow, you see, would fain be cutting out work for the lawyers.

<P>There, Sir. You've compar'd it, no doubt: Put the papers under one enclosure, and carry them to Miss Fairfax's; make my respects, and say I will have the honour of waiting on her this forenoon, and stating some particulars in my opinion that may want explaining.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>(Goes to the table and puts up the papers.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you ready, Frampton? you and I must step to the hall. How we appear to that spruce gentleman! His father wore a livery; his sister is waiting-woman to Miss Fairfax, the very lady he is going to in that monkey habit: Is there no persuading him to suit his dress to his condition? Believe me, Frampton, there is much good sense in old distinctions: When the law lays down its full-bottom'd perriwig, you will find less wisdom in bald pates than you are aware of.</P>
<STAGE>(Exeunt.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Alone.</STAGE>
<P>What a damn'd queer figure old Frampton makes of himself? I must never show him at our Sunday's club, never. The Counsellor's little better: It does well enough for chamber practice, but he cou'dn't walk the hall in that wig: It's nothing now unless a good club of hair peeps under the tye: I hope shortly to see the day when Westminster-hall shall be able to count cues with the Parade.—<STAGE>(He sits down. A knock∣ing at the door.)</STAGE>—Who's at the door?

<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No witch, but an old bone-setting mare, with a heavy cloak-bag at her crupper, that has play'd a bit∣ter tune upon my ribs. Where's his honour, Master Dibble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out. Give me hold of thy hand, old boy. What's the best news in your parts? Hav'n't earth'd old Surly-Boots yet?</P>

<P>Earth'd him! no such luck; he's a tough morsel. He's above ground, as my head can testify.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's action and battery with a vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Battery! he knows the strength of my scull, as well as a sand-man knows the back of his ass, and cudgels it as often: But he's hard at hand—When will his honour, Manlove, be at home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Presently, presently. What brings your old blade hither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old errand: a little bit of law; a small jig to the tune of John Doe and Richard Roe; that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plaintiff, I bet five to one. But how does my playmate, Jack? how fares it with young Hopeful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gads-my-life; well remember'd! here's a writing for you: 'Tis a merciless scrawl to be sure; he's not at all come on in his running-hand, not at all; no, tho' I talk to him, and talk to him, and tell him what a fine young man his brother Charles is here, Mr. Manlove I must call him now; for his honour,
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
I am told, since his return from travel, has nominated him afresh after himself, hasn't he, Master Dibble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; 'twas done last sessions; he's no longer Charles Nightshade, but Charles Manlove, Esq. and a brave estate he's got by the exchange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>All these things I ding into the ears of our young scape-grace, Jack; but I might as well whistle the birds from the sky, as talk him out of his tricks; mobbing with the carter-fellows, and scampering after the maids: All the while too the arch knave contrives to blind the eyes of old Choleric, his father, sitting as demure as a cat, till he is fairly in for his evening's nap, then away goes he, like hey-go-mad, all the parish over. Well, have you made out his letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll attempt to read it to you.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Pickle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Old Choleric is setting off for London, and thinks to leave me in the country, but it won't do: Must have another brush with the lads at the Bear: intend to be at brother Charles's on Wednesday at noon, where you'll meet me. Old Trusty carries this, and understands trap: Mum's the word. Thine,</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN NIGHTSHADE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>So you are privy to this trip, Gregory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Master Dibble; we are all of his side: There is not a servant wou'd peach, if he was to com∣mit murder amongst 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But hold, here is more over the leaf. <HI>Gregory says I was of age last Lammas, if you know of ever a clean tight wench, that will take me out of old Choleric's clutches, I don't care if I buckle too for life.</HI> N. B. <HI>She must have the Spanish, or the bait won't take.</HI></P>

So, so! he's for a wife you see: Has he ever talk'd to you in this strain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now and then, but I always tell him 'tis time to think of marrying when the old badger is in the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! you're to blame: We'll make a man of him; we'll set him up with a wife. I have a girl in my eye; a friend of my own—provided you will bear a hand in the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bear a hand, Master Dibble! You are a lawyer and can take care of yourself, I'm a poor servant and have a character to lose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; but if I pay you for your character, and your service into the bargain; every thing has its price you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, there's no denying that: But, hark! here comes his honour Manlove.</P>

<P>Enough—Where are you lodg'd?</P>

<P>Game, quotha! if he comes to talk to me about hares and partridges, Gregory, I won't hear of it: Such laws, and such law-suits are the disgrace of the country—I won't hear a word upon the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's quite a breach; he has totally left off going to church himself, and forbade all his family; nay, what's more, he has broke his back-gammon tables, only because the parson taught him the game. Mercy o' me, that ever your honour and my old master shou'd be born of the same mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the same mother, but very different fathers, Gregory: Doom'd from early youth to a life merely mercantile, his days have been pass'd between a compting-house at Rotterdam, and the cabbin of a Dutch dogger; precious universities! One son, in∣deed, he allow'd me to rescue from his hands, and to him I have given a public education; the other poor lad has been a bird of his own breeding.</P>

<P>I tell you, fellow, there's your fare: I'll not give you a farthing over. A hard shilling indeed! a hard coach if you please!—Brother Manlove, your servant! This town grows worse and worse; no conscience, no police—If I was not the most patient man alive, such things would turn my brain—Brother Manlove, I say, your servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Andrew, you are welcome. You seem'd a little ruffled, so I waited for its subsiding, and now give me your hand: I am glad to see you in town, provided the occasion be agreeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the law has a proviso for every thing: Your compliment sets off, like the preamble of a statute, and your conclusion limps after like the clause at the tail of it. So you keep your old apart∣ments, and as slovenly as ever—Lincoln's-Inn and the law—so runs your life. A turn upon the Terrace after breakfast, a mutton chop for dinner at the Rolls, and the eyening papers at the Mount, wind up your day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A narrow scale, I own; but whether it be that I was made too small for grandeur, or grandeur be too small for happiness, I never could entertain both guests together, so I took the humblest of the two, and left the other for my betters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, 'tis too late to alter; 'twou'd be a vain endea∣vour to correct your temper at these years—By the way, brother, your stair-case is the dirtiest I ever sate my foot upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So long as we have clean dealings within, our cliants will make no complaint. Your's, I warrant, was neater at Rotterdam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neater! 'tis matter of astonishment to me, how you that have a plentiful estate, can make yourself a slave to business, and drudge away your life in such a hole as this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Andrew, 'twas unreasonable; but as I have now made over the best part of my estate to your son, so I think I have answered the best part of your objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall excuse me, all the world cries out upon your folly; you are apt to be a little hasty, else I should be free to tell you, you have made yourself ridiculous; and what is worse, Brother Charles, I speak to you as a father, you have undone my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so? have I confin'd him in his education?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith; the scale on which you've finish'd him is wide enough to take in vice and folly at full size; his principles won't cramp their growth. At school he was grounded in impudence, the University con∣firm'd him in ignorance, and the grand tour stock'd him with infidelity and bad pictures—such has been his education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you, in your wisdom, pursued a different course with your younger son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bred him as a rational creature should be bred, under the rod of discipline, under the lash of my own arm; I gave him a sober, frugal, godly training; and mark the difference between us—Your fellow lives here in this great city, in a round of pleasures, in the front of the fashion, squandering and revelling:—Mine abides patiently in the country, toiling and travailing; early at his duty, sparing at his meals, patient of fatigue; he hears no music as Charles does, purchases no fine pictures, lolls in no fine chariot, befools himself with no fine women; no, thank my stars, I've rescued one of my boys; Jack at least treads in the steps of his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope he will; better principles I cannot wish him; but methinks, Andrew, a little more knowledge of the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Knowledge of the world, Brother Charles! who knows so much? Belike you never heard then I had made three trips to Shetland, in a herring-buss, before you was born? have been three times charter'd to Statia for muscovadoes; twice to Zante for currants, and made one voyage to Bencoolen for pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that pepper-voyage runs in your blood still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better; it will preserve my wits, it will season my understanding from such flyblown folly as your's. Zooks! you to talk of knowledge of the world! where should you come by it? upon Clap∣ham-Common? upon Bansted-Downs? Did you ever s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the pike of Teneriffe, the rock of Gibraltar, or even the Bishop and his Clerks?

<P>There's my purse, Jack; it contains enough to spend, and some to throw away: Frederick com∣mands the wardrobe; if you find any thing to your mind, take it; if not, convene my taylor, he'll equip you in an instant: Follow your propensities, but take a little discretion to your aid; your nature has not had much pruning, and 'till experience shall have clear'd the path of life, pleasure may be apt to spread some snares in your way that may cost you sorrow to escape from.</P>

</SP>

<P>The declaration you made to her this morning; I dread the artificial graces which young women are too apt to put on, when they act under observation; so quiet, so chastis'd, so infinitely obliging: We think 'em meak as lambs; marry 'em, and they change to mountain-cats.

<P>Come along, Mr. What's-your-name: Enter with∣out more ceremony I beseech you—An old formal blockhead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I attend you, Sir, by order of Mr. Manlove, touching a case wherein you have consulted him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, that's true; it is the pigeon-house case—I gave it him this morning: Is it usual for you lawyers to be so nimble with your answers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not unusual with Mr. Manlove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what thinks he of the case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The case is a clear case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it heartily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>In other words, it is a case clear to be apprehended: It hath reference to a pigeon-house, built and erected in a certain field, commonly known by the name of the Vicar's Homestèad. <HI>Quaere: Standeth not the said pigeon-house within the manorial rights of Calves-Town, and in that case, may not you, Andrew Night-shade,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
<HI>Esq. lord of said manor, remove, or cause to be remov'd, said vicar's pigeon-house.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pull down, erase, destroy, and level with the ground; those are my words. Now give me the opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has given no opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No opinion! what the plague is this your errand? Am I to be made a fool of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>To his clients Mr. Manlove gives opinions, to his friends advice. He wishes you to let the pigeon-house stand where it does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fig for what he wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, if you're so determin'd, he does not deny but you may pull it down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's enough. Then down it goes: I'll sow the land with salt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRAMPTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nevertheless, he wills me to tell you, that this must be done <HI>tuo periculo,</HI> as the saying is; for if your conscience does not prevent you from pulling it down, the law will make you build it up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The law has made a fool of you, methinks: Why, what the deuce do you blow hot and cold in the same breath? Is this the way you treat your clients? Am I to be fobb'd off thus by an old methodical piece of clock-work, by a stiff starcht limb of the law, a cutter of goose quills, and a scraper of parchments? No: Evacuate my chamber. Tell your principal I'll none of his advice; I value his opinion not a rush: Shall I be taught and tutor'd at these years?
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
I'm sure I am an older man, and I believe a wiser than himself—so tell him, Master Frampton.</P>

<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour shall hear the whole proceeding: At Thavies-Inn I first got scent of him, threw off, and took the drag as far as Shoe-Lane; there he hung cover; I had a warm burst to the Fleet; hunted him thro' Turn-again-Lane to the Old-Bailey; got an entapis, and run into him in Labour-in-vain-Court, Old Fish-Street-Hill—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what says he to the prosecution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>For some time he said nothing; for when I first arrived he was on a visit to a friend under sentence of death in Newgate: however, after a while he came home, and then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What said he then? to the point, Dunce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he said, an please your honour, he wou'd have nothing to do with the business: There's no credit to be got by such prosecutions; if it had been
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
on a criminal indictment indeed—but he won't be con∣cern'd in any vexatious suit about game; humanity won't suffer him.</P>

<P>Keep the peace, in the King's name! what's the matter now, friend Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this sot would fain have me believe that a Newgate solicitor will refuse a suit upon motives of humanity: A likely tale indeed! He comes home from the society of a condemn'd malefactor, and scruples levying the penalty against a poaching par∣son. What would the noblemen and gentlemen, asso∣ciated for the preservation of our game, say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who cares what they would say! What have men of business to do with such disputes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Men of business! I have no business: I left off trade, thank heaven, in time: You'll stay till it has left off you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? Our warehouses are as full, our com∣missions as many, our credit as good as ever: What do you see about us makes you prophecy so ill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, your trade is ebbing fast away from you in every quarter of the globe. Look out and satisfy yourself; but I have done, 'tis no concern of mine—What are your treaties with the Portuguese?
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>
waste paper; linings for old trunks to carry home the refuse goods, that they return upon your hands. Another man would flatter you; but I'm your friend; I let you know these things in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>A most considerate precaution, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have now no leisure for conversations of this na∣ture, but I would ask a thinking man, what must be the fate of your Turkey trade? Undone. You've burnt their ships it seems, now you may burn your own; you'll have no further call for them, unless you send them to your colonies, to air your goods and ex∣ercise your sailors—but I've something else to think of—Gregory, my hat! I'm staying here too long. Your servant, Mr. Stapleton—remember I have told you now, I've let you know your danger—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the tenderest manner; you are the kindest friend: If we are ruin'd, you'll have nothing to regret—Your servant—we shall meet again at supper—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I just step back to tell you that your weavers are all rising: I fell in with a large party of them in the streets: Your people migrating by thousands: What! men must not starve—I hint this to you gently, and in pure good will; I have no interest to serve—and so your servant for an hour or two—I'll tell you more when I return—Oh, if I was a man to turn the gloomy side of things upon you, I could draw a melancholly picture truly!</P>

<P>Your papa! let it be father in your mouth, if I might advise you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What person?</P>

<P>A person from abroad; a painting man, I believe; he says he has a recommendation to you—there are many such call here.</P>

<P>If he has any letter of recommendation, desire he will be pleased to send it in. <STAGE>(Exit Lucy.)</STAGE> I cannot reconcile myself to this methodical course of proceed∣ing; in the name of all that's happy, let our inclina∣tions get the start of our proposals: If I could meet this Mr. Manlove naturally, and without form; if we

were then to single out each other by the guidance of no other monitor than the heart, and if a thousand ifs besides were all to prove realities, a happy alliance might succeed; but to be turn'd into a room to un∣dergo the profest survey of a man, who comes upon a visit of liking, is insupportably humiliating.

<P><HI>The bearer of this letter, is a young man in whose prosperity I am warmly interested. He is lately return'd from Italy, where he has made some proficiency in the art of which you are a mistress; and as I flatter myself you will find him not unworthy, I beg leave to recommend him to your protection and esteem. When my nephew has the honour of being known to you, he can give you fuller satisfaction in this young man's particular than I can; in the mean time I venture to add, that Mr. Manlove will consider every favour you bestow, in this instance, as con∣ferr'd upon himself.

<P>You are lately from Italy: Where did you princi∣pally pursue your studies?</P>

<P>At Rome: I visited Florence, Bologna, Venice and other places; but I regard Rome as the grand repository of the antique, and for that reason I made my principal residence there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what branch of the art did you chiefly direct your attention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the study of beauty, Madam; and that in its simplest forms: A Laocoon, a Hercules, or a Ca∣racalla may astonish; but it is a Faustina, a Venus, an Apollo that delights, that ravishes—But I am speaking to you on a subject of which you are both by art a mistress, and an example by nature.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Busily, my girl, busily. I have borrowed a mo∣ment's time from company to run to you: I have luckily found you alone: Utter not a word; be all attention: Jack Nightshade, the country boy I made acquaintance with last year, is now in town; but not a word of that—He is at a tavern hard by, with some lads of mettle, who push about the glass. What say you, Hussey, to a bold stroke for a husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a husband! You are joking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Serious, upon my honour! Oh, when the blood begins to boil, and the brain begins to turn, every thing may be attempted. He has signified to me that he is in want of a wife; you, I suppose, have no ob∣jection to a husband; so far you are both of a mind. He says the lady must be rich; the condition is a rea∣sonable one; and you must provide a fortune for the purpose: What say you to your mistress's? He visits you in the name of Mr. Manlove; why may not you receive him in that of Miss Fairfax?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! Don't you know his father lodges in this very house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scare boys with bug-bears: I have provided against danger; and with a promise of a good round sum, upon the wedding night, have made old Gregory my own: He will aid our project, and keep watch upon old Surly-boots, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is gain'd, if we shou'd compass our ends? the young man is a minor, and his father wou'd dis∣inherit him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing—he's of age—Gregory confirms it: And as for his father's disinheriting him, I'll tell you a secret; it is not in his power: When the Counsellor settled an estate on Charles, old Nightshade cut him off with a shilling, and gave his fortune to Jack: I drew the deed myself; it is as tight as law can tye it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say; a settlement to be sure is something; Mrs. Nightshade and an equipage, is better than plain Lucy and a pair of pattens: But then my heart misgives me—and the boy, they say, is such a cub—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine airs, in truth! Nay, if you are so exceptious, please yourself; it's no affair of mine; I've done with it.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, leave me to draw the marriage deed; I'll jointure you I warrant. Come, decide; time's pre∣cious, and the moment serves: Old Nightshade's out; the ladies too, I understand, are on the wing—When shall we come?</P>

<P>Pshaw! you are so irresolute; ev'n be a servant∣maid all days of your life; I care not.</P>

<P>No, brother; I've as much ambition as my betters, so here's my hand—I'm with you—give me half an hour's time to con my lesson and I'll be ready for you.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my brave girl! Courage! the day's our own. If every thing's in train, and the coast clear, let Gregory meet us at the corner of the street, ex∣actly in half an hour's time. But, hark'ee, Lucy; Jack is incog, and takes his brother Manlove's name, remember that: By the way, I suspect something's in the wind between your Madam and Mr. Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIBBLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I saw him turn into her room just now, in an undress; he pass'd me on the stairs, and whisper'd me in the ear, not to open my lips concerning his being here to a single soul, for my life; therefore make no mischief—Farewel, I must be gone.</P>

Are you a painter as well as your ward here?

<P>Ridiculous! Do you observe that picture, Madam; 'tis a melancholly story, very finely told by Pouss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n: It is a view of Marseilles at the time of the plague, with a capital figure of the good bishop in the midst of the groupe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK</SPEAKER>
<P>Bishop, Madam! that person which you look up∣on is a physician, and the people round about him are his patients; they are in a desperate way it must be confest. Do you see that angry figure in the corner; he is a gamester: he is picking lead out of loaded dice to run into bullets, to fire through his own head: 'Tis no bad moral.</P>

<SP>

<P>You are infinitely kind to favour us with these anecdotes: If you are thus gracious to all strangers, the world will edify abundantly.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am told it is an art which ladies mostly practise in their own chambers—What say you to that picture over the door? 'tis a merry conceit.</P>

<P>It is the colouring of the Venetian school: I should guess it to be <HI>Tintoret.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you are quite out of the story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is speaking of the master: The story is plainly that of Actaeon, and no bad moral; he was turn'd into a stag, by the goddess of chastity, for his im∣pertinent curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Madam, you mistake the moral—That gentleman with the antlers on his head, is a city husband, the principal lady in the show is his wife; she wears a crescent on her forehead to signify she is a dealer in horns; her companions are a groupe of city Madams: The painter drew them bathing to shew the warmth of their constitutions.</P>

<P>Really, Madam, I shou'd wish to do justice to a lady's good opinion: but your visit, I must say, was rather unseasonable, and that elderly Lady was so vexatiously in the way.</P>

<P>I readily believe it—and therefore, Sir, though it is not altogether in character for me to promote a conversation of such a sort as you hinted at when we met at your own house; yet, I must observe to you, if you have any such proposal in design, it will be for both our ease that you shou'd come to the point directly.</P>

<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the point, Madam! Upon my soul I don't know what to say to that—To be sure I did come here with a full and fixt design of offering myself to Miss Fairfax upon the marrying lay, and that, you know, at best is but a hanging kind of job; so that if I appear rather dull of apprehension, I hope you will recollect that a man cannot be very merry when he's on his road to his execution.</P>

<P>Ah, Mr. Nightshade, will you never be brought off from this unhappy temper? You see the dismal effects of it; you feel them; I perceive you do: Your compunction is severe; I pity you—your situation brings the tears into my eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's more than it does into mine; I tell you it is all a collusion to extort money; and this rogue of mine falls in with the plot. Stapleton will tell another story.</P>

<P>To be sure, madam, his honour is in the right to bear up as they say, but it will be a trapan at least: The china riviter at next door is a knowing man in fractures, and he says his scull will never ring well again so long as it is a scull. Oh, Sir, what will poor dear Master Jacky think of this? He's in the country, lord love him, and little dreams of this mishap; I fear 'twill break his heart.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, and how do you like it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'm in hopes it will blow over; I think they'll hardly prosecute, and if the worst shou'd hap∣pen, they can make nothing of it, but chance-medley or manslaughter; nothing else, Gregory: So there's little to fear from the law. But as I am a man, who have always enforced the law against other people, d'ye observe me, and consequently made enemies amongst the wicked; I shou'd think, honest Gregory, you might stand in my place, and I'd be sure to bring you off, and reward you into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, a trifle; I shou'd be proud of being hang'd in the service of so good a master; but I'm afraid there were too many people present, and 'twou'd be gross presumption to suppose any body cou'd mis∣take me for your honour.</P>

<P>Make over your estate to Master Jacky, and fly your country: What if I run to the French walk, and take you a passage in the Boulogne Pacquet? I may be in time to secure the cabbin before any other malefactor has taken a birth in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Malefactor! prythee let me hear no more of your advice, it is but wasting time; I must have better counsel; and tho' brother Manlove has not pleas'd me in the matter of the pigeon-house, yet he's a good man in the main, and understands his business; run to him, d'ye hear, and desire him to repair here directly, upon a pressing concern; I know he'll not refuse assistance when I really want him.</P>

<P>I am to solicit you in behalf of Mr. Manlove, that he may be allow'd the honour of making him∣self known to you.</P>

<P>That is done already: I am no stranger to Mr. Manlove, believe me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The character he has assumed, I must fairly own to you, gives me no favourable opinion of his real one: The shallow devices he made use of to impose on my understanding, when he thought himself secure from a discovery, betray a disingenuous mind; and I must believe, that no man wou'd descend from the character of a gentleman, who was not wanting in the requisites that go to the support of it.</P>

<P>I'm fairly trapp'd: I must be prating of what I did not understand—I will not offer much in Mr. Manlove's behalf, Madam; but as to his skill in painting, you will be pleas'd to consider him not as a professor, but a lover only of the art.</P>

<P>No, the case is perfectly clear; and I flatter myself you think I have been explicit on my part.</P>

<P>I should think, brother, there's no danger but a jury will see the action in this light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard to say; juries are ticklish things; the law will look to the motives: <HI>If it shall appear that it was done not from the wickedness of the heart, but from the sudden heat of the passions,</HI> a jury will bring it in <HI>Manslaughter.</HI></P>

<P>Nay, brother, blame not nature, she has done her part: 'Tis you that shou'd have till'd the soil. O Charles, you come upon a wish; your father is im∣patient to embrace you.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CHARLES.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let but my father add his approbation, and my happiness shall be compleat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can't withhold it. Come, throw prejudice aside; let wrath and jealousy be cast far from you: Look upon this youth; he is your son; you are the principle, but do you substitute the justice to confess my system has succeeded; it is possible you see to gain a knowledge of this world, and not be tainted with its wickedness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHAE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis mighty well; but for this cub of mine I'll disinherit him to the devil; I cou'd find in my heart, to die to-morrow, for the pleasure of cutting him off with a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, father, in that case a little matter wou'd content me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, the law has made provision against that: Jack must inherit your estate die when you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll not die at all; I'll live for ever on purpose to plague him; I'll starve the whelp; he shall have nothing to live upon, but rain-water and pig-nuts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Andrew, I will keep him; he shall live with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NIGHTSHADE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, brother? then I'll forgive him and keep him to myself; and since you talk of knowledge of the world, I'll shew him what it is: Come hither,
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
Jack: I'll go with him as far as there is water to carry us; I'll travel him to the world's end: Zounds, I'll take him out of it, rather than be out▪gone.</P>

<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take the last stage by yourself, dear father. Farewel, uncle; good-bye, Charles!</P>

<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incorrigible humourist! Come my son, and come my worthy friends: Where is your amiable ward? I still have hopes this day of rancour and confusion will conclude with joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it shall, if my persuasion can have weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persuasion never fails, when inclination aids it. Look, she comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And comes like hope, like spring and sunshine to the longing year, with smiles of soft complacency and love.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now your rival's gone, you think the field your own; but every hour will raise fresh rivals, for every hour will draw forth fresh perfections from a character like your's, and each demand the preference in our admiration and applause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my girl, then there's a bargain made; What need of further words?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye upon you, Mr. Stapleton, you distress her; you are too much in haste about these matters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> STAPLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Dolly, you and I concluded our matter within the week.</P>

<SP>

<P>Longer, 'twas longer: Don't believe him, Laetitia.</P>

<SPEAKER>LAETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, I can readily believe that hearts so fitted for each other might unite at once by mutual at∣traction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dost thou believe it, fair one? then away with all delay! not even the law, its own parent, shall be pri∣vileg'd in this case; we'll work like shipwrights at an armament, and Dibble, as a punishment for his intrigues, shall labour double tides. If marriage ever shall regain its dignity in this degenerate age, is must be by the union of such hearts as these.</P>
