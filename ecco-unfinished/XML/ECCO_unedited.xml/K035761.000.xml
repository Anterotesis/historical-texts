<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM THE <HI>Princess</HI> SOBIESKI, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O Thee, dear <HI>JAMES,</HI> my Lover and my Friend,</L>
<L>From <HI>Inspruck</HI>'s Tow'rs these mourn∣ful Lines I send,</L>
<L>Where in a Cloister, by unjust Alarms,</L>
<L>The <HI>German</HI> Pow'rs with-hold me from thy Arms;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>To Thee, <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Native, exil'd KING,</L>
<L>I send in Writing what I fain would bring,</L>
<L>Long Health I send, and, void of winning Art,</L>
<L>The kindest Wishes of a Love-sick-Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As to thy Arms my flying Steps I sped,</L>
<L>Wing'd with the Pleasures of thy promis'd Bed,</L>
<L>While my big Heart with eager Transports rose,</L>
<L>And swell'd, unconscious of approaching Woes,</L>
<L>Ye Gods! how shocking was the dire Decree,</L>
<L>That snatch'd Me from those Pleasures, and from Thee?</L>
<L>With Grief and Rage I heard the dreadful Tale,</L>
<L>My Limbs grew feeble and my Cheeks turn'd pale.</L>
<L>My trembling Heart forgot its wonted Pride,</L>
<L>And my Blood crept along, a frozen Tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>No Joys to Me these lonely Walls afford,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the Fortunes of my absent Lord;</L>
<L>Let spleenful Prudes and antiquated Maids</L>
<L>Affect the Convent's solitary Shades,</L>
<L>Make Mid-night Zeal and Chastity their Care,</L>
<L>And starve the Sense with Abstinence and Pray'r;</L>
<L>Ill suits with me this dull, abstemious Life,</L>
<L>Who want to be a Mistress or a Wife;</L>
<L>How vain to Me, whose Breast with Passion beats,</L>
<L>These dark Recesses and obscure Retreats?</L>
<L>My burning Pulse no Vows can e'er restrain,</L>
<L>Useless is Penance, and Devotion vain,</L>
<L>Whilst to my God I lift my solemn Eyes,</L>
<L>To Thee my wand'ring Thought in Transport flies,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>From Wish to Wish incessantly I rove,</L>
<L>And drop the Beads in Extasies of Love;</L>
<L>Heav'n in my Pray'rs claims but the meaner Part,</L>
<L>My Lips alone; my Lover has my Heart.</L>
<L>Thou, Thou alone employ'st my pensive Mind,</L>
<L>And in thy Love all other Joys I find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thro' the Horrors of the silent Dome</L>
<L>I meditate in Tears on Thee and <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>For Thee and <HI>Rome</HI> my Vows to Heav'n address,</L>
<L>And all the Passion of my Soul confess;</L>
<L>My Flame the Holy Sisterhood reprove,</L>
<L>And cant Religion whilst I burn with Love;</L>
<L>Ev'n now the promis'd Moments I employ,</L>
<L>And my Limbs tremble with the distant Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>But O! What Torments did thy Bosom bear,</L>
<L>When first my sad Afflictions reach'd thy Ear?</L>
<L>What Rage and Sorrow did thy Soul divide,</L>
<L>Despoil'd of thy unhappy, loving Bride?</L>
<L>How did'st Thou weeping curse the impious Hand,</L>
<L>That durst obey so lawless a Command?</L>
<L>How did'st Thou mourn this greatest killing Cross,</L>
<L>And think Three Kingdoms but a trifling Loss?</L>
<L>How did'st Thou wish for me alone to live,</L>
<L>And e'en great <HI>Brunswick</HI> in thy Rage forgive?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unhappy Lover, and unhappy Man!</L>
<L>Whose early Suff'rings with thy Life began,</L>
<L>Whom angry Heav'n, surrounding Thee with Foes,</L>
<L>Seems to mark out a Monument of Woes!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>Ill after Ill thy Royal Breast alarms,</L>
<L>In Love as unsuccessful as in Arms,</L>
<L>Eternal Wrath the cruel Fates ordain,</L>
<L>And to thy Wishes I am kind in Vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still is the Victor in thy Fall employ'd?</L>
<L>How void of Conscience, and of Mercy void?</L>
<L>Will not the <HI>British</HI> Diadem suffice,</L>
<L>And does he still demand a dearer Prize? —</L>
<L>Swoln with Success, with bloody Laurels crown'd,</L>
<L>The World is for his Pride a narrow Bound;</L>
<L>Plum'd with imperial Greatness let him Reign</L>
<L>Lord of the Sea, and dictate Peace to <HI>Spain;</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Austria</HI> mighty Leagues design,</L>
<L>And with the potent Realms in Friendship joyn:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>To his Decisions let all Nations yield,</L>
<L>Fam'd let him be in Council and the Field,</L>
<L>In Wealth, in Titles, and in Empire grow,</L>
<L>And of the Regal Honours strip thy Brow,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Alberoni</HI>'s tott'ring Schemes controul,</L>
<L>And triumph in the Fulness of his Soul;</L>
<L>Not all his Grandeur shall thy Envy move</L>
<L>Let Him but grant Thee <HI>Sobieski</HI>'s Love.</L>
<L>Possess'd of Me, to Him thou shalt resign</L>
<L>Thy bootless, lineal Claims, and Right Divine,</L>
<L>For Me Thou shalt renounce all future Schemes,</L>
<L>All Vain Aerial Hopes and flatt'ring Dreams,</L>
<L>Patient to Heav'n submit, and Heaven's Decree,</L>
<L>And find the Empire of the World in Me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>But how, ah! how, thus helpless and distrest,</L>
<L>How shall I meet Thee, take Thee to my Breast,</L>
<L>Hang round thy Neck, my furious Fires impart,</L>
<L>And whisper out the Fondness of my Heart?</L>
<L>Immur'd alas! I live from publick Sight,</L>
<L>And meditate with fruitless Arts my Flight,</L>
<L>Darkling in Mid-night Vigils I complain</L>
<L>That bounteous Heav'n has giv'n me Charms in vain:</L>
<L>Relentless Walls and Bolts obstruct my Way,</L>
<L>And Guards as senseless and as deaf as They,</L>
<L>Or to my <HI>James</HI> thro' Whirlwinds I would go,</L>
<L>Thro' burning Desarts and o'er <HI>Alps</HI> of Snow,</L>
<L>Pass spacious roaring Oceans undismay'd,</L>
<L>And think the mighty Dangers well repaid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>But thou at large, by more auspicious Fates</L>
<L>Securely roam'st thro' Fair <HI>Ausonia</HI>'s States;</L>
<L>Ev'n thy poor Lot is less severe than mine,</L>
<L>Thee no strong Bars nor Prison-walls confine,</L>
<L>Thou art but simply wretched, Thou art free,</L>
<L>And Master of thy Will, compar'd to me:</L>
<L>Why therefore, arm'd with Justice on thy Side,</L>
<L>May'st Thou not rescue thy imprison'd Bride?</L>
<L>Quick at the Call accouter for the Fight,</L>
<L>And issue forth a bold advent'rous Knight,</L>
<L>Let Glory prompt Thee to the gen'rous Deed,</L>
<L>Grasp the tough Lance, and mount the fiery Steed,</L>
<L>Collect thy Vengeance, put forth all thy Soul,</L>
<L>And hasten from <HI>Ferrara</HI> to <HI>Tyrol:</HI></L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>The banish'd Duke shall his Assistance lend,</L>

<L>Nor draw upon thy self such dreadful Foes;</L>
<L>As well on mighty <HI>George,</HI> that envy'd Name,</L>
<L>Again thou might'st renew thy baffled Claim,</L>
<L>In Arms once more provoke him to the Fight,</L>
<L>And from his Thunder steal thy private Flight;</L>
<L>Whose Cause all <HI>Europe</HI> against Thee defends,</L>
<L>And Emperours are proud to be his Friends,</L>
<L>Invaded Monarchs to his Aid resort,</L>
<L>And throng with their Ambassadours his Court;</L>

<L>And in his great Alliances partakes,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<L>Nor art Thou skill'd in Arms by Land or Sea,</L>
<L>And Fighting is an Art, unknown to Thee;</L>
<L>The martial Sword Thou know'st not how to wield,</L>
<L>And the loud Cannon scares Thee from the Field,</L>
<L>Bloodshed and Death thy trembling Heart possess;</L>
<L>(Ev'n all thy Friends the well-known Truth confess,)</L>
<L>Unfit, alass! Heroick Acts to dare,</L>
<L>To storm the Castle and relieve the Fair,</L>
<L>In bloody Justs to poize the beamy Launce,</L>
<L>And charm the Ladies in a new Romance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No; thy proud Rival rather humbly greet,</L>
<L>And fall a lowly Suppliant at his Feet,</L>
<L>Strive with submissive Arts to gain his Ears,</L>
<L>With Pray'rs, Intreaties and persuasive Tears,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>Thy bold Pretensions to his Crown deplore,</L>
<L>And promise never to disturb him more:</L>
<L>Say farther, that an helpless, dying Maid,</L>
<L>Implores his Pity, and conjures his Aid;</L>
<L>Say that a Princess, beautiful and young,</L>
<L>Who never yet offended, knows no wrong,</L>
<L>His Title never, nor his Right deny'd,</L>
<L>Begs by his Truth and Justice to be try'd,</L>
<L>Longs his unbounded Clemency to bless,</L>
<L>And his great Goodness with his Foes confess;</L>
<L>Say that to Him her Sufferings She commends,</L>
<L>Say on his Mercy that her Life depends,</L>
<L>Say all thou can'st; and for the Want of Art,</L>
<L>Let Tears express the Meaning of thy Heart:</L>
<L>At length perhaps his gen'rous Soul may melt,</L>
<L>Touch'd with a Passion which Himself has felt,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>His Candour to the World he may approve,</L>

<L>Nor groundless is the Hope; for join'd to Thee,</L>
<L>Alas! what Dangers can He fear from Me!</L>
<L>I have no Armies in thy Cause to fight,</L>
<L>No Friends to question or dispute Thy Right,</L>
<L>To Crowns I neither dare nor wish to tour,</L>
<L>It is not in my Will, nor in my Pow'r.</L>
<L>Crowns are to me ridiculous and mean,</L>

<L>Ambition never yet disturb'd my Head,</L>
<L>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gen'rous Lover, not the King, I wed,</L>
<L>The golden Wreath and Scepter I despise,</L>
<L>Thou art alone to Me the richest Prize.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<L>Were my great Sire alive, Immortal King!</L>
<L>With whose Exploits remotest Nations ring,</L>
<L>In vain Himself would in thy Cause engage,</L>
<L>And stem th' impetuous Torrent of the Age,</L>
<L>Tho' crown'd with Fame, and dreadful from afar,</L>
<L>(Great as he was) the Thunderbolt of War;</L>
<L>For still we must allow, what none denies,</L>
<L>That BRUNSWICK is as valiant and as wise;</L>
<L>In vain thy Friends his deep Designs oppose,</L>
<L>As fam'd in War, as dreadful to his Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But He is dead, and I am left alone,</L>
<L>Weak, and unable to attempt a Throne;</L>
<L>To teaze Thy Foes indeed, officious Fame</L>
<L>Reports Me wealthy, magnifies My Name,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>And boasts my Pow'r; but Fame, O gentle Youth!</L>
<L>Like other Maids, not always speaks the Truth:</L>
<L>'Tis a good Maxim, well-approv'd, and old,</L>
<L>That Female Dowries swell as oft as told;</L>
<L>Those fickle, wav'ring Stocks, in sooth to say,</L>
<L>Fall <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> upon the Wedding-Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No present Dangers from our Love arise,</L>
<L>No wealthy Treasures, and no strong Allies;</L>
<L>No potent Armies to disturb his Reign,</L>
<L>No Force by Land, nor Empire o'er the Main;</L>
<L>Yet studious our united Souls to part,</L>
<L>Still some new Plea the Conqueror may start,</L>
<L>His Care to future Ages may extend,</L>

<L>Yet groundless too such Jealousies appear,</L>
<L>Begot in sickly Brains, the Dreams of Fear:</L>
<L>For should the Stars this greatest Boon afford,</L>
<L>And, Mistress of my Wish, I call Thee Lord:</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n shou'd bless Us with a num'rous Line,</L>

<L>Tho' fruitful as thy UNCLE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>King</HI> CHARLES II.</NOTE> Thou should'st prove,</L>

<L>In vain thy vengeful Heir, when Thou art Dead,</L>
<L>Would strive to pluck the Crown from <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Head;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>In vain would strive, in his Ambition crost,</L>
<L>To gain the Kingdoms which his Father lost;</L>

<L>For now quite stale the Passive Doctrine grows,</L>
<L>Scoff'd and derided by Thy learned Foes;</L>
<L>The Danger of the Church begins to cease,</L>
<L>And with each rising Sun thy Friends decrease;</L>
<L>No longer in a ruin'd Cause confide,</L>
<L>And one by one desert to <HI>Brunswick's</HI> Side.</L>

<LG>
<L>But, if relentless to our common Grief,</L>

<L>If, tho' no Dangers can from hence arise,</L>
<L>He still detains Me from Thy longing Eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="20"/>Death shall release Me from insulting Woe,</L>
<L>Death is My Friend, tho' <HI>Brunswick</HI> be My Foe:</L>
<L>Robb'd of My dearest Hopes, how vain is Life,</L>
<L>With all the Passions in my Breast at Strife?</L>
<L>'Tis mean to live, when Life becomes our Curse,</L>

<L>Dying, my constant Passion will I prove</L>
<L>A mournful Instance of ill-fated Love;</L>
<L>I'll grasp the pointed Sword, or drench the Bowl,</L>
