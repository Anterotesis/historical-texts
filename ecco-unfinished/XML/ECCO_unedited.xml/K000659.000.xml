<HEAD>A <HI>CONGRATULATORY</HI> EPISTLE To the Right Honourable <HI>JOSEPH ADDISON,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE Half the Globe is shook with Wars and Arms,</L>
<L>And <HI>Europe</HI> labours with unripe Alarms;</L>
<L>While the mad SUEDE, with Insolence unknown,</L>
<L>Affects new Kingdoms, and betrays his own:</L>
<L>From <HI>Isis'</HI> Laurel'd Banks, the Muse reveals</L>
<L>A Joy which ev'ry honest <HI>Briton</HI> feels,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>Who sees his Country's and his KING's Commands,</L>
<L>Intrusted to your unpolluted Hands.</L>
<L>Accept, Immortal Sir! an artless Song,</L>
<L>From One, the meanest, of the Vocal Throng,</L>
<L>Who joys to see distinguish'd Merit rise,</L>
<L>Advanc'd the foremost in his PRINCE'S Eyes.</L>
<L>From Public Cares One Hour relieve your Breast,</L>
<L>And let the Cause of Warring Nations rest;</L>
<L>While, smote with Glory and Poetic Flame,</L>
<L>Boldly I strive to reach your Deathless Name:</L>
<L>On daring Wings the boundless Height I soar,</L>
<L>Thro' trackless Skies, and Worlds unseen before.</L>
<L>What Tongue so impious to condemn my Pain,</L>
<L>If ADDISON approves the Youthful Strain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>But where shall I begin? — With equal Light,</L>
<L>The POET and the PATRIOT strike my Sight:</L>
<L>Candour unrival'd, and ennobled Love,</L>
<L>Demand the Muse, and her vast Theme improve;</L>
<L>To raise my Verse un-number'd Gifts conspire,</L>
<L>And fill my Bosom with ungovern'd Fire;</L>
<L>For to adorn your Person are combin'd</L>
<L>A piercing Judgment, and unblemish'd Mind:</L>
<L>Each Scene of Life, with rising Wonders fraught,</L>
<L>Crouds to my View, and swells my lab'ring Thought.</L>
<L>In what you write, the Spirit of the Nine,</L>
<L>And all APOLLO teems in ev'ry Line:</L>
<L>In all you act, transfus'd into your Breast,</L>
<L>Great BRUNSWICK's Soul burns out, in strongest Light confest.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>From WARWICK'S Eyes, and Your own spotless So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>You MARCIA'S Charms, and CATO'S Virtues stole</L>
<L>My grov'ling Fancy sinks beneath Your Praise,</L>
<L>And my Breast labours with unequal Lays,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From You the Poet borrows all his Rage,</L>
<L>Unstrung with Years, nor yet matur'd by Age:</L>
<L>Fir'd by Your Numbers, he attempts to write,</L>
<L>That, un-inspir'd, would have declin'd the Flight;</L>
<L>Wrapt and transported with each glowing Line,</L>
<L>In his own Breast he feels the Rage Divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft, between the Guilty and the Fair,</L>
<L>Hath ROSAMONDA'S Blood engag'd my Care?</L>
<L>Forbidden Love, and Majesty betray'd,</L>
<L>By Turns excite my Pity, and upbraid.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow oft have I bewail'd, in CATO'S Doom,</L>

<L>My boiling Veins throb with tumultuous Heats,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Pulse with Martial Ardour beats!</L>
