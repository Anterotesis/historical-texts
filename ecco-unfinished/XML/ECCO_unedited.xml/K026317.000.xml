<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the LIFE of Mrs. <HI>Anne Oldfield</HI>.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Loss which the polite Part of the Town has sustained, in the Death of Mrs. OLDFIELD, must be allowed to be irrepara∣ble; because, in Comedy, as she never had, so she has not left, her Equal.</P>
<P>Mrs. ANNE OLDFIELD was born in <HI>Pall-Mall</HI>, in the Year 1683. Her Grandfather was a Vintner, but on her Mother's Side she was well descended. Her Father rode in the Guards, and I have heard had a Commission under King JAMES before he died. By his free Way of Living, he not only run out his In∣come, but likewise spent a very pretty Paternal Estate. His Daughter was put to Mrs. <HI>Wotton</HI>, a Sempstress in <HI>King-street Westminster</HI>, but her Genius for the Stage was predominant, as appeared by her continual reading and re∣peating Parts of Plays. Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> being left in strait Circumstances, She and her Daughter lived for some time with her
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Sister Mrs. <HI>Voss</HI>, who kept the Mitre Ta∣vern in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Market. She married a Second Husband, one <HI>Wood</HI>. Her Daughter Mrs. <HI>Anne Oldfield</HI> was introduced to Mr. CHRISTOPHER RICH, by the late Sir JOHN VANBRUGH, in the Year 1699. About which time Mrs. <HI>Cross</HI> having made an Excursion to <HI>France</HI>, with a certain Baronet, Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI>'s <HI>first</HI> Appearance on the Stage was in a Part of Her's, <HI>viz.</HI> CANDIOPE, in <HI>Secret Love:</HI> Or, the <HI>Maiden Queen</HI>; a Tragi-Comedy, writ∣ten by Mr. DRYDEN.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Second</HI> Appearance was in a more Capital Part, ALINDA, in the <HI>Pilgrim</HI> of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, in which Sir JOHN VANBRUGH made some <HI>Alterations</HI>, and Mr. DRYDEN wrote a <HI>Masque</HI>, to ren∣der the Revival of this Play more agreeable to the Town, together with a New <HI>Prologue</HI> and <HI>Epilogue</HI>. The <HI>Pilgrim</HI> was indeed re∣vived for the Benefit of Mr. DRYDEN, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1700, but he dying on the third Night of its Representation, his Son attended the Run of it, and the Advantages accrued to his Fa∣mily. About three Years after, upon the Decease of that eminent Actress Mrs. VER∣BRUGGEN, who died in Child-bed, Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI> succeeded her in the Part of Lady <HI>Lurewell</HI>, in the <HI>Constant Couple</HI>: Or, a <HI>Trip</HI> to the <HI>Jubilee</HI>, written by Mr. FAR∣QUHAR, which run Fifty-two Nights. But
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
the Part that render'd Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Ex∣cellence chiefly known to the Town, was that of Lady <HI>Betty Modish</HI>, in the <HI>Careless Husband</HI>, a Comedy, written by Mr. CIBBER, in the Year 1704. In this Character it was that those two Qualities, before observed by Mr. CIBBER, of the <HI>Genteel</HI> and the <HI>Elegant</HI>, shone out in Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> to their greatest Degree of Perfection; and the Character was so admirably suited to the natural and agree∣able Manner of Conversation peculiar to Mrs. OLDFIELD, that almost every Sen∣tence, in the Part, may with Justice be said to have been heard from her own Mouth be∣fore she pronounced it on the Stage. In short, it was not the Part of Lady <HI>Betty Mo∣dish</HI>, represented by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>; but it was the real Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> who appeared in the Character of Lady <HI>Betty Modish</HI>.</P>
<P>THE same Year, the Royal Company of Comedians went down to <HI>Bath</HI>, where, among several Plays acted by them during the Season, Miss <HI>Campion</HI>, not only by her Action, but her Singing and Dancing, had so far captivated the most noble WILLIAM Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>, Father of the late Duke, that he took her off the Stage. Of this Amour farther Mention will be hereafter made; because it is intended that these Me∣moirs shall not only, with the utmost Fide∣lity, consist of a Recital of the peculiar Ex∣cellencies of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, but likewise
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
contain a short digressionary History of the Fate and Fortunes of the most considerable Actresses during the same Period of Time: an Attempt which I hope will not be less useful than entertaining to every Reader.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that about this Time, a strict Alliance of Friendship had com∣menced between <HI>Arthur Maynwaring</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI>, who wrote the Life of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, assures the Public,
<Q>“That each of them loved with a Passion, that could hardly have been stronger, had it been both <HI>Hers</HI> and ”<HI>His</HI> first Love.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Maynwaring<HI>'s</HI> Life, 8<HI>vo.</HI> pag. 43 &amp;c.</NOTE> It was doubtless ow∣ing, in a great Measure, to his Instructions, that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> became so admirable a <HI>Player</HI>, for as no body understood the <HI>Action</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI> better than himself, so no body took greater Pleasure than he to see her excel in it. He wrote several <HI>Prologues</HI> and <HI>Epilogues</HI> for her, and would always hear her rehearse them in private before she spoke them in public: I shall insert Part of one, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Epilogue</HI> to the <HI>Wife's Relief:</HI> Or, The <HI>Husband's Cure</HI>. A Comedy written by Mr. <HI>Charles Johnson</HI>.</NOTE> to which in the Speaking she gave an inimitable Turn of Humour; being an agreeable Display of the Manner how the Ladies would Go∣vern under a <HI>Feminine Monarchy</HI>.</P>
<Q><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<LG>
<L>Could we a <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Women</HI> call,</L>
<L>We'd <HI>vote</HI> such <HI>Statutes</HI> as would <HI>tame ye all</HI>:</L>
<L>First, we'd <HI>resolve</HI>, that all those <HI>marry'd Fellows</HI>,</L>
<L>Should <HI>Banishment</HI> endure, who durst be <HI>Jealous</HI>:</L>
<L>For tho' that curst <HI>Disease</HI> proceeds from <HI>Love</HI>'s soft Passion,</L>
<L>Nothing should be a <HI>Crime</HI> in <HI>Us</HI> but Demonstration.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, that those dull, uncomfortable Wights,</L>
<L>Who <HI>sleep</HI> all <HI>Morning</HI>, and who <HI>sot</HI> o' <HI>Nights</HI>,</L>
<L>Should find, when they <HI>reel</HI> Home with <HI>Surfeits</HI> cloy'd,</L>
<L>Their tender <HI>Wives</HI> with better <HI>Friends</HI> employ'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lastly, the <HI>Man</HI> who breaks the Marriage-Vow,</L>
<L>(If any such, <HI>in this good House</HI>, you know)</L>
<L>For the <HI>first Time</HI>, should suffer a <HI>Divorce</HI>;</L>
<L>Adieu those tempting Words—<HI>for better and for worse:</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Ladies</HI> should be free again to <HI>wed</HI>,</L>
<L>And the <HI>false Men</HI> be <HI>naturally</HI> dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hold! what makes <HI>me</HI> impotently rant?</L>
<L>The <HI>Will</HI> we have—but O! the Power we want:</L>
<L>And you, vile <HI>Husbands</HI>, when these Threats you hear,</L>
<L>Will only grow worse Tyrants than you were.</L>
<L>Yet have a Care — for tho' we cannot make</L>
<L><HI>Laws</HI> for <HI>Mankind</HI>, we can their <HI>Orders</HI> break.</L>
<L>The <HI>War</HI>, 'tis said, is drawing to an End;</L>
<L>And not <HI>one Woman</HI> then can want a <HI>Friend</HI>.</L>
<L>The <HI>Brave</HI> will all to this dear Town repair,</L>
<L>And they were always <HI>Guardians</HI> of the <HI>Fair</HI>;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<L>By faithful Service to their Country done,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Sex</HI>'s Favour they have fairly won;</L>
<L>And may they still have this propitious Doom,</L>
<L><HI>Conquest</HI> Abroad, and just Returns at Home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These are our Wishes, — and if any here</L>
<L>The glorious Character of <HI>Soldier</HI> bear,</L>
<L>I hope their Favour to this Play they'll show,</L>
<L>And <HI>pay</HI> our <HI>Poet</HI> what to <HI>us</HI> they <HI>owe</HI>.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Friends, some of whom were of the highest Rank, of both Sexes of∣ten blamed him, nay, have had such Quarrels with him concerning this Affair, that even Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> herself has frequently represented to him, that it was for his <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Inte∣rest</HI> to break off their <HI>Alliance</HI>, which open Frankness, on her Side, did as he has often confessed, engage him to her the more firm∣ly, and all his Friends at last, gave over im∣portuning him to leave her. They saw, by her most engaging Manner, that she daily, and hourly, more and more entangled him in <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Nets, and it must be allowed that Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> is not the only wise Man who has fallen a Victim to <HI>Venus</HI>. He real∣ly sustained a greater Weight of the public Affairs, than some whose Posts more imme∣diately load them with the Burthen. His very great Intimacy and Friendship with my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough</HI>,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
who were then at the Head of the Ministry, could not but necessarily involve him in Political Researches, and it was to unbend his Mind that he took Delight to pass some Hours with a Woman, whose Conver∣sation was both soft and pleasant, and exactly agreeable to his own. It is not to be sup∣posed that two Persons under such an Affec∣tionate Alliance, could meet without Consum∣mation; and all the Quarter that is desired for Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Reputation in this Transaction of his Life, is, that none but the Innocent would condemn him. For what Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> has observed of the <HI>Primitive State</HI>, may be justly applied to the Satisfaction they en∣joyed in each other.</P>
<Q><L>Pure from Deceit, devoid of Fear and Strife,</L>
<L>While Love was all the pensive Care of Life.</L></Q>
<P>IT cannot be denied, but this Amour was very expensive to Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, tho' it was not the only erroneous Instance of his Oeconomy. No Man could have a greater Contempt for Money, or abhorred what was mean and sordid more than he did: And it was wholly owing to his Generosity and Negli∣gence of his own Affairs, that after he had so profitable a Post, as Auditor of the Imprest conferred on him, yet he made no Addition to his Fortune. When he sold his Estate of <HI>Ight∣field</HI> in <HI>Shropshire</HI>, to my Lord <HI>Kilmurry</HI>, there
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
was not, when the Mortgages were paid off, above four Thousand Pounds left to be divided between him and his Sister. The Management of his Domestic Affairs he gave intirely up to his Sister and Servants; and those that knew what was the Conduct of his Family at <HI>White∣hall</HI>, never thought that he would be the richer for his Post. His Company was so much the Delight of the <HI>Great</HI>, the <HI>Fair</HI> and the <HI>Gay</HI>, that he was very little at Home. However, we must leave him for a while in the Business of his Post; made happy, at certain Intervals, by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, in whose Conversation all his Political Fatigues were most agreeably alle∣viated.</P>
<P>ABOUT this Time, the <HI>English</HI> Stage met with as much Opposition as the <HI>State</HI>. No∣thing would go down but <HI>Italian</HI> Operas, and indeed Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, being a Lover of Mu∣sic, and a fine Performer himself, gave into this Polite Taste, and wrote the following <HI>Prologue</HI> to CAMILLA.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>While martial Troops, with more than martial Rage,</L>
<L>For <HI>Austria</HI> these, for <HI>Bourbon</HI> those engage;</L>
<L>Cover with Blood th' unhappy <HI>Latian</HI> Plains,</L>
<L>Insult their Shepherds, and oppress their Swains;</L>
<L>CAMILLA, frighten'd from her native Seat,</L>
<L>Hither is driv'n to beg a false Retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>O may the exil'd Nymph a Refuge find!</L>
<L>Such as may ease the Labours of her Mind:</L>
<L>Hear her, ye Fair, in tuneful Notes complain,</L>
<L>Pity her Anguish and remove her Pain;</L>
<L>To you her Vindication does belong,</L>
<L>To you the Mourner has address'd her Song.</L>
<L>Let her your Hearts with just Compassion move,</L>
<L>By Music soften'd and endear'd by Love;</L>
<L>So may your Warriour Lords successful fight,</L>
<L>May Honour crown the Day and Love the Night.</L>
<L>May Conquest still attend their generous Arms,</L>
<L>Till their Swords grow as fatal your Charms.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>BUT let it here be observed, that tho' Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Love of Music made him give some Encouragement to the <HI>Italian</HI> Operas; yet he was a fast Friend and vigo∣rously pushed all his Interest, both for pro∣moting and improving the Entertainment of the <HI>English</HI> Theatre, being truly sensible of this Remark,
<Q><L>While <HI>Nicolino</HI> like a <HI>Tyrant</HI> reigns,</L>
<L><HI>Nature</HI>'s <HI>neglected</HI>, and the <HI>Stage</HI> in <HI>Chains</HI>. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epilogue <HI>to the</HI> Careless Husband.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>WE must now return to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, rising every Season in Reputation, from her inimitable Performance, first acquired under
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
the Character of Lady <HI>Betty Modish</HI>, and in which she shone more, than in all the Parts wherein she had hitherto appeared.</P>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Careless Husband</HI>, thus impartially states the Case, to his most noble Pa∣tron the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>:
<Q>“The best Criticks have long and justly complained, that the Coarseness of most Characters in our late Co∣medies have been unfit Entertainments for <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Quality</HI>, especially the <HI>Ladies:</HI> And therefore, <HI>says he</HI>, I was long in hopes that some able Pen, whose Expectation did not hang upon the Profits of Success, would ge∣nerously attempt to reform the Town into a <HI>better Taste</HI> than the World generally allows them: But nothing of that Kind having lately appeared, that would give an Opportunity of being wise at another's Expence, I found it impossible any longer to resist the secret Temptation of my Vanity, and so e'en struck the first Blow myself: And the Event has now convinced me, <HI>that whoever sticks close to</HI> Na∣ture, <HI>cannot easily write above the Understand∣ing of the</HI> Galleries, <HI>tho' at the same time he may may possibly deserve Applause of the</HI> ”Boxes.</Q></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Play</HI>, before its Tryal on the Stage, was examined by several People of Qua∣lity, who came into the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>'s Opi∣nion of its being a just, a proper, and diverting
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Attempt in Comedy; but few of them carried the Compliment beyond their private Approba∣tion:
<Q>“For, says Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, when I was wishing for a little farther Hope, they stopt short of your <HI>Grace</HI>'s Penetration, and only <HI>wished</HI> me what they seemed to <HI>fear</HI>, and you assured me of, a <HI>general Success</HI>. And, if the Dialogue of <HI>this Comedy</HI> flows with a more easy Turn of Thought and Spirit, than what I have usually produced; I shall not yet blame some People for saying <HI>it is not my own</HI>, unless they know at the same Time I owe most of it to the many stolen Observa∣tions I have made from your <HI>Grace</HI>'s Manner ”of Conversing.</Q></P>
<P>I SHOULD not have dwelt so long on this Play, were it not the Period from whence we may date the Birth of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> as an Actress. And, to demonstrate how exactly the Drama∣tical-Pencil has delineated her <HI>real Character</HI>, under the <HI>imaginary one</HI> of Lady <HI>Betty Modish</HI>, I shall, both for the Reader's Entertainment and Information, refer him to the <HI>first</HI> Scene of the <HI>second</HI> Act of the Play, between Lady <HI>Mo∣dish</HI> and Lady <HI>Easy</HI>; wherein the Descriptions given of the Allurements of Dress, and other captivating Charms, of Wit, Raillery and Con∣versation, for which Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> was so peculi∣arly remarkable, make it appear self-eivdent, that none but <HI>she</HI> could have sat for the Picture.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>IT must here be noted, that, the Summer before the Appearance of the <HI>Careless Husband</HI> on the Stage, Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI> spent the Recess of a whole long Vacation at <HI>Windsor</HI>, the Scene of that Comedy, where they lodged in the Castle, at the House of Mr. <HI>John Sewell</HI>, Treasurer and Chapter-Clerk to the Dean and College. The Application of this Hint, I submit to the Reader's Judgment, when he has consider'd the <HI>Interview</HI> between the <HI>two Ladies</HI> abovementioned.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Chit-chat</HI> of Lady <HI>Betty Modish</HI>, may be found the fine Raillery of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. It was her Wit that made her Company always acceptable to Persons of the highest Rank; and as to her outward Appearance, it was beautiful without Artifice, and her Address engaging with∣out Affectation.</P>
<P>WE must now return to Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, who being made happy by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> with the Birth of a Son, it was such a Rivet to <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Chains, as bound him much faster to his <HI>Venus</HI>. However, Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> made a serious Ap∣plication of this natural Incident; and set a firm Resolution to himself of regula∣ting his future Conduct. He reduced all his Expences to stated Allowances, and laid by a considerable Part of the Income of his Audi∣torship, saying, <HI>He had been such a Fool as to
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
despise Money till then, but now he would do as other Men did, and endeavour to grow Rich</HI>. But this Resolution was formed too late; for his Company was so much the Delight of the Great, the Fair and the Gay, that he was very little at Home. He drank freely, and as his Wines were generally <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Burgun∣dy</HI>, it was to their corrosive Qualities that he im∣puted the ill State of Health he was fallen in∣to; and has often spoken with Concern, of the Misfortune it had been to him, that People thought his Conversation so agreeable, as to expose him to Intemperance. However, Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> by her Care, and tender Affection for him, pro∣longed his Life some Years; and her Generosi∣ty has been so great, towards his Son, that she has, by her Last Will and Testament, bequeathed him a Legacy much more than double the Es∣tate his Father left, besides other Provisions made for him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> No. I. <HI>and</HI> II. <HI>of the</HI> Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>I SHALL now resume the Thread of my Dramatical Narrations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>UPON Mrs. <HI>Cross</HI>'s Excursion to <HI>Paris</HI>, as before mentioned, I remember a jocose Distich in an <HI>Epilogue</HI> spoken by <HI>Jo. Haines</HI>, on that Occasion, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<L>We're ruin'd quite, we are not worth one Souse,</L>
<L>We've lost the only <HI>Touch-Hole</HI> of our House.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cross</HI>, last, belonged to the Threatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, and has been some Years.</P>
<P>LET us next view Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in the Tra∣gic Scene. In <HI>Phaedra</HI> and <HI>Hippolitus</HI>, she ap∣peared in Company suitable to her own. The <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI> of that excellent Play, consisted but of four Men and two Women, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Keene</HI>, Mr. <HI>Corey</HI>; Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI>.</P>
<P>PHAEDRA, says Mr. <HI>Oldiswo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Character of the Author, prefix'd to his Works, <HI>pag. xiv.</HI></NOTE>, is a consummate Tragedy; and, the <HI>Success</HI> of it was as great, as the most sanguine Expecta∣tions of the Author's Friends could promise, or foresee. The <HI>Number</HI> of Nights, and the common Method of filling the <HI>House</HI>, are not always the surest Marks of judging what En∣couragement a Play meets with: But the Ge∣nerosity of all the Persons of a refined Taste a∣bout Town was remarkable on this Occasion: And it must not be forgotten how zealously Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> espoused its Interest, with all the elegant Judgment and diffusive Good-nature, for which that accomplished Gentleman was so justly valued by Mankind. But as to <HI>Phaedra</HI>,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
she has certainly made a finer Figure under Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Conduct, upon the <HI>English</HI> Stage, than either at <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI>; and if she excels the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin Phaedra</HI>, I need not be put to the Trouble of saying she surpasses the <HI>French</HI> one, tho' embellished with whatever regular Beauties, and moving Softness, <HI>Racine</HI> himself could give her.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Prologue</HI> to this <HI>Tragedy</HI> was written by Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>, and spoken by Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>. The fine turn of Raillery it contains against the <HI>Italian</HI> Theatre, will, I think, justify my trans∣cribing it in this Place in Defence of the <HI>English</HI> one, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Long has a Race of Heroes fill'd the Stage,</L>
<L>That rant by Note, and thro' the Gamut rage;</L>
<L>In Songs and Airs express their martial Fire,</L>
<L>Combat in Trills, and in a Feuge expire;</L>
<L>While lull'd by Sound, and undisturb'd by Wit,</L>

<L>And from the dull Fatigue of Thinking free,</L>

<L>But he, a Stranger to your modish Way,</L>
<L>But your old Rules must stand or fall to-day,</L>
<L>And hopes you will foreign Taste command,</L>
<L>To bear for once with what you understand.</L>

<P>IN the Representation of the Play itself, who could sit unmoved at a Recital of the Passions of <HI>Theseus</HI>'s Queen, or the Princess <HI>Ismena</HI>, for their <HI>Hippolitus</HI>, when a <HI>Barry</HI> and an <HI>Old∣field</HI> were the Pleaders?</P>
<P>AND who was not <HI>pierced to the Heart</HI> when <HI>Ismena</HI> pronounced these Lines?</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Let them be cruel that delight in Mischief;</L>
<L>I'm of a softer Mould; poor <HI>Phaedra</HI>'s Sorrows</L>
<L>Pierce thro' my yielding Heart and wound my Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For could you think that open gen'rous <HI>Youth</HI></L>
<L>Could with feign'd love deceive a jealous Woman?</L>
<L>Could he so soon grow artful in dissembling?</L>
<L>Ah! without doubt his Thoughts inspir'd his Tongue,</L>
<L>And all his Soul receiv'd a real Love.</L>
<L>Perhaps new Graces darted from her Eyes,</L>
<L>Perhaps soft Pity charm'd his yielding Soul,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>Perhaps her Love, perhaps her Kingdom charm'd him!</L>
<L>Perhaps — Alas! how many Things might charm him!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>THE Care of <HI>Ismena</HI>, to preserve <HI>Hippo∣litus</HI>, and the Resolution she forms of sharing his Fate, is thus inimitably expressed:
<Q><LG>
<L>O! haste away, my Lord, I go, I fly</L>
<L>Thro' all the Dangers of the boist'rous Deep.</L>
<L>When the Wind whistles thro' the crackling Masts,</L>
<L>When thro' the yawning Ship the foaming Sea</L>
<L>Rolls bubbling in; then, then I'll clasp thee fast,</L>
<L>And in transporting Love forget my Fear;</L>
<L>O! I will wander thro' the <HI>Scythian</HI> Gloom,</L>
<L>O'er Ice and Hills of everlasting Snow:</L>
<L>There when the horrid Darkness shall enclose us,</L>
<L>When the bleak Wind shall chill my shiv'ring Limbs,</L>
<L>Thou shalt alone supply the distant Sun,</L>
<L>And chear my gazing Eyes, and warm my Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<P>THE Quotations I have here made, are to show the admirable Diction of this Play, and to justify Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Censure, in the <HI>Tatler</HI>, of <HI>the Want of Taste in the Audience</HI>, for <HI>not encouraging this excellent Tragedy</HI>.</P>

<Q><LG>
<L>Ladies, to-night your Pity I implore</L>
<L>For one who never troubled you before:</L>
<L>An <HI>Oxford</HI> Man, extreamly read in <HI>Greek</HI>,</L>
<L>Who from <HI>Eu—ripides</HI> makes <HI>Phaedra</HI> speak,</L>
<L>And comes to Town to let us Moderns know,</L>
<L>How Women lov'd two thousands Years ago.</L>
<L>If that be all, said I, e'en burn your Play,</L>
<L>I gad we know all That as well as they:</L>
<L>Show us the youthful handsome Charioteer,</L>
<L>Firm in his Seat, and running his Career;</L>
<L>Our Souls wou'd kindle with as gen'rous Flames,</L>
<L>As e'er inspir'd the antient <HI>Grecian</HI> Dames:</L>

<L>But, as it is, Six flouncing <HI>Flanders</HI> Mares</L>

<L>Now of the Bustle you have seen to-day,</L>
<L>And <HI>Phaedra</HI>'s Morals in this Scholar's Play;</L>
<L>Something, at last, in Justice should be said,</L>
<L>But this <HI>Hippolitus</HI> so fills one's Head. —</L>
<L>Well! <HI>Phaedra</HI> liv'd as chastly as she cou'd,</L>
<L>For she was Father <HI>Jove</HI>'s own Flesh and Blood;</L>
<L>Her aukward Love, indeed, was oddly sated,</L>
<L>She and her <HI>Poly</HI> were too near related;</L>
<L>And yet that Scruple had been laid aside,</L>
<L>If honest <HI>Theseus</HI> had but fairly dy'd:</L>
<L>But when he came, what needed he to know,</L>
<L>But that all Matters stood in <HI>Statu quo</HI>?</L>
<L>There was no harm, you see; or grant there were,</L>
<L>She might want Conduct, but he wanted Care.</L>
<L>'Twas in a Husband little less than rude,</L>
<L>Upon his Wife's Retirement to intrude:</L>
<L>He shou'd have sent a Night or two before,</L>
<L>That he wou'd come exact at such an Hour;</L>
<L>Then he had turn'd all Tragedy to Jest,</L>
<L>Found ev'ry thing contribute to his Rest;</L>
<L>The Picquet Friend dismiss'd, the Coast all clear,</L>
<L>And Spouse alone, impatient for her Dear.</L>
</LG>

<L>But if these gay Reflections come too late</L>
<L>To keep the guilty <HI>Phaedra</HI> from her Fate;</L>
<L>If your more serious Judgment must condemn</L>
<L>The dire Effects of her unhappy Flame:</L>
<L>Yet, ye chaste Matrons, and ye tender Fair,</L>
<L>Let Love and Innocence engage your Care.</L>
<L>My spotless Flames to your Protection take,</L>
<L>And spare poor <HI>Phaedra</HI> for <HI>Ismena</HI>'s sake.</L>

<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> gained an universal Applause by playing <HI>Ismena</HI>, in this Tragedy. The Character shewed her in a Light of Perfection hardly to be expressed; and in∣deed every Part she acted was a Demonstration of her daily Improvement.</P>
<P>SOME Differences arising between Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> and his Company, they joined in with the Company at the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>, Acting un∣der the Licence of <HI>Vanburgh</HI> and <HI>Congreve</HI>, where Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, both famous in their Way, had been for some time. But Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Voice, Figure and Manner of Playing soon made <HI>her</HI> shine out, even here, the <HI>brightest Star</HI>. Upon the Preference being given to her in the <HI>Be∣nefit-Plays</HI>, and other Disputes fomented among the Managers, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> entirely quitted the Business, and left Mrs. <HI>Oldfield sole Empress of the Stage</HI>.</P>
<P>THE Season following, the <HI>Revolters</HI> re∣turning to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, made up one com∣pleat Company; and in the Spring came on Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI>'s Tragedy, The <HI>Distrest Mo∣ther</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Rogers</HI>, an Actress, who in her Turn, had made a considerable Figure on the Stage, was designed the Part of (<HI>An∣dromache, Hector</HI>'s Widow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> i. e.) the <HI>Distrest Mother</HI>. But the Author, as well as his Friends, were soon convinced that
<PB N="21" REF="22" MS="y"/>
Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> was infinitely the more ac∣complished Person for so Capital a Part. Up∣on its being given to Her, Mrs. <HI>Rogers</HI> raised a Posse of Profligates, fond of Tumult and Riot, who made such a Commotion in the House, that the Court hearing of it, sent four of the Royal Messengers, and a strong Guard, to suppress all Disorders. This being effect∣ed, the Play was brought upon the Stage and crowned with deserved Success.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had introduced a <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy upon our Theatre, Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> was willing to try what Reception would be gi∣ven to a <HI>French</HI> one. <HI>Phaedra</HI> and <HI>Hippo∣litus</HI>, is by much the superiour Performance; but the <HI>Distrest Mother</HI>, by Dramatical Management, to which Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> was an utter Stranger, greatly exceeded it in the Run; and to do the <HI>English</HI> Author Justice, it is a good modern Play. I shall here let him speak, for himself, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>HOWEVER, I cannot think it improper, in this Place, to remark, that as full as Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> is of his <HI>Elogiums</HI> on <HI>Monsieur Racine</HI>, yet at the same Time <HI>Euripides</HI> is acknowledged to be the Original Author.

<P>I must now relate the melancholy Parting of two sincere Friends. Notwithstanding Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s great Care and Concern for Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Welfare, his Negligence of him∣self brought upon him a violent Relapse of his former Indisposition, which daily increased; in∣somuch that his Friends began to despair of his Recovery.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>Such was the Inveteracy of Party-Malice at this Time, that (because Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> was chiefly concerned in writing the <HI>Medley</HI>) the <HI>Examiner</HI>, in one of his Papers, upbraided him, even with his <HI>sickly Constitution</HI>, which however was not owing to any <HI>Debaucheries</HI>, as he had maliciously represented.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> had Lodgings at <HI>Hamp∣stead</HI>, and rode out every Day, hoping for some Benefit by that most healthful Exercise. But, upon paying a Visit to her Grace the Dutch∣ess of <HI>Malborough</HI>, at her Seat near <HI>St. Albans</HI>, he caught so violent a Cold by walking too late in the Gardens, and it increased upon him so fast, that it was his own Opinion, it would fi∣nish what his former Illness had began. His Physicians, Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>, expressed very small Hopes of his Recovery; which gave the more Cause of Ap∣prehension to his Friends, for both those Gen∣tlemen were among the first of that Number, and as much concerned in Friendship as Prac∣tice, to save him if possible. His Relations would have Dr. <HI>Radcliffe</HI> consulted, and the late Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> happening to see the Doc∣tor before he had been with Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> spoke thus to him—<HI>Pray Doctor take Care of that Gentleman, one of the most valuable Lives in</HI> England. Indeed Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> was at last so much obliged by that Minister's good Offices and Civilities, that he declared, if he should recover, <HI>he would never more draw his
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Pen against him</HI>. But it was out of the Power of Physick to help him, his inward Decay was so great. He was thrown into such a languish∣ing Condition, that tho' his Distemper was not then thought to be a <HI>Consumption</HI>, yet it had all the Symptoms and Effects produced by one. He was visited, in this his last Sickness, by all the great People of both Sexes, who had the Happiness of his Acquaintance, tho' he was able to see but few of them. And it its to his Glory, that the <HI>Greatest Lady</HI> in <HI>England</HI> wept often by his Bed-side, which Tears he mutual∣ly returned, being <HI>sensible</HI> how much he owed to such an Illustrious Mourner, when he was sensible of little or nothing else. He had not Words to express the Transport he felt, when he was almost even in the Agony, to see him∣self so far in the good Graces of a Lady of such high Rank and Merit, as that his Danger should strike her Dumb, and leave it to her Eyes to express the Sorrow of her Heart. It is suppos∣ed he would fain have endeavoured to have broke thro' the Excess of his Grief, and formed some Utterance for it; but his Sister remained in the Room. This Emotion of his was the more extraordinary, on account of a slight Mis∣understanding at that Time, between him and this Great Lady. He had given her some Cause of Disgust, but was not conscious to himself in what, and it is thought, that his Perplexity about it contributed somewhat to the Increase of his Distemper. He did all in his Power to express his
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Concern for the unknown Offence, but he was too near Death, and in a few Hours after she had left him, he expired in the Arms of his Servant Mr. <HI>Thomas Wood</HI>, now Treasurer of the Theatre in <HI>Lincolns-Inn</HI> Fields, on the 12th of <HI>November</HI>, 1712, in the Prime of his Age, being but 44 Years old.</P>
<P>AFTER his Decease, a most scandalous and false Rumour was spread, chiefly levelled at Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, that he died of a Venereal Malady. But to obviate so ungenerous a Reflection, his Body, by her Direction, was opened by two Surgeons —Mr. <HI>Bussiere</HI> and Mr. <HI>Browne</HI>; in the Presence of two Physicians, Dr. <HI>Beeston</HI> and Dr. <HI>West</HI>; and of his Apothecary Mr. <HI>Buck∣eridge</HI>.</P>
<P>These Gentleman, all, declared, that there was not the least Symptom of any thing <HI>Venere∣al</HI>; but that he died of a Consumption. He had in his Life-time, heard the Whisperings of ma∣licious Rumour, charging him with such an In∣disposition; but he once complained very pa∣thetically to He, that he was not conscious of any such Distemper; confessing at the same time, that, in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI>, he had made an unfortunate Sally in an Amour, which gave him a slight Taint at <HI>Paris</HI>, 1698; that he was only patcht up there, but afterwards perfectly cured at <HI>London</HI>, since which Time he never had any such Misfortune.</P>
<P>IT is the Duty of an Historian to speak the Truth, as far as it comes to his Knowledge,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
and as great a Veneration as I have for Mr. <HI>Mayn∣waring</HI>'s Memory, I could not avoid mentioning even this Blemish of it, in Justice, and to clear up the unjust Aspersion cast on Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>.</P>
<P>IT was not long before his Death, that he made his Will, all which he wrote with his own Hand, and to which his Apothecary Mr. <HI>Buckeridge</HI>, and his Servant Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>, were Witnesses, when it wat executed at Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s House in <HI>South∣ampton-Street, Covent-Garden</HI>. He charged them not to take any Notice of what they knew; which however was little enough, for he intrusted no body with the Secret of his having made Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> his Executrix, tho' by her Behaviour to him, he could not in Justice do otherwise, on his Son's Account; nor could any Woman better de∣serve all that was in his Power to give; of which Truth his Son is a living Witness.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Clamour his Will made, after his Decease; himself, who best knew what he had to leave her, could not im∣gine such a Stir would have been made about so small an Estate. He was far from dying Rich, leaving evry little more than Three Thousand Pounds behind him, which he divided equal∣ly between his Sister, his Son's Mother, and the Child, who, in Feature and Vivacity, was very like his Father. Often have I heard Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> bemoan the Child, and say, <HI>What will become of the Boy when I am gone</HI>. This Anxiety proceeded from the <HI>Little</HI> he pos∣sessed. It is true he had such a noble Contempt
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
of the Goods of Fortune, that he never took Care to make one, nor ever resolved to grow Rich.</P>
<P>HAD I a Talent for Panegyric, I could be proud of this Opportunity to do Justice to the Memory of a Gentleman, whose Name would be Immortal, had not his Modesty been as great as his Merit; had he not contented him∣self with the <HI>Pleasure</HI> of Writing, and resigned the <HI>Glory</HI> of it to others. As to the Author of the <HI>Medley</HI>, the <HI>Examiner</HI> was obliged to allow that he wrote with <HI>a Tolerable Spirit, and in a Masterly Style</HI>. A <HI>Spirit</HI>, indeed, which has not many Equals, and a <HI>Style</HI> worthy the Imi∣tation of the greatest Masters. His Learning was without Pedantry; his Wit Affectation; his Judgment, without Malice; his Friendship, without Interest; his Zeal, without Violence; in a Word, he was the best Subject, the best Relation, the best Master, the best Critic, and best Political Writer in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after his Decease, was publish∣ed <HI>a Defence of</HI> Mr. <HI>Maynwaring, in a Letter to a Friend</HI>. It was, Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> asserts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Posthumous Works</HI> of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> published by him, <HI>pag. 351.</HI></NOTE>, supposed to be written by the Right Honourable <HI>Robert Walpole</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and is not unworthy so good a Hand for its Generosity, Spirit; and Ele∣gance, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I write to you upon a Circumstance, for which it is the Interest of all Mankind to be concerned. The Public is under the Adminis∣tration of its respective Ministers and Officers, who are obliged by their Posts to consult the true Welfare of it. But Incidents, which hap∣pen alike to all, and from which no Man can be exempt, fall under every Man's Care, and are to be considered and laid home to the Bo∣som of every Man breathing. It is incumbent upon each individual Person, for his own sake, to <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>Absent</HI>; but much more so to <HI>defend the Dead</HI>, who are to be <HI>absent for ever</HI>. I have Reasons for thinking I am called to this Duty, upon the accidental Perusal of a virulent Libel, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> EXAMINER February 9<HI>th</HI>, 1712. 13.</NOTE> wherein the Author, after much Dis∣course about <HI>himself</HI>, has (alluding to a Gentle∣man who lately departed this Life) the follow∣ing Words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>“Suppose I were also to tell the World, That the most active Enemy against this <HI>Paper</HI>, was <HI>one</HI> who got to be poor in the <HI>Jacobite Cause</HI>, and then run over in∣to <HI>Two</HI> desperate Extreams, and was resolved at once to grow Rich and Honest in the Cause of the <HI>Whigs</HI>. That outlived his Works a little too long; till having parted with Religion and Morality, he threw away his Honour in a careless manner after it, together with his Humanity and natural Affection to
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
a kind Sister, his Estate, Fortune, and even the Vouchers belonging to his Office: All which were bestowed, as Monumental Le∣gacies of <HI>Whig Honesty</HI>, on a celebrated ACTRSES, who is too much admired <HI>upon the Stage</HI>, to have any Enquiry made in her ”Conduct <HI>behind the Curtain</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>THE Person here levelled at, (Mr. <HI>Mayn∣waring</HI>) was, in his younger Days, tinctured with <HI>Jacobitism</HI>; an Error no Man ever re∣nounced more heartily, and with greater Ab∣horrence of it than he did. He was a Man of great Modesty, and could not exert himself in Public Places, or in mixt Company; but when, in Process of Time, his Talents grew conspicu∣ous, in spite of a bashful Nature, he was invit∣ed and courted into a Familiarity with Men in the highest Power, and of the greatest Abilities in the Kingdom, to whom his Conversation was both a Pleasure and a Service. Then it was that his Words and Actions first began to manifest the Principles in which he lived and died. He had the highest Obligations to that great Minister, <HI>Sidney</HI>, Ear of <HI>Godol∣phin</HI>, Lord High Treasurer, and enjoyed by his Favour, an Office for Life (<HI>Auditor of the Imprest</HI>.) After the Removal of that noble Lord from the Treasury, the <HI>Examiner</HI> thought fit to disparage his Services, by Insinuations and Reflections, which the Gentleman, of whom we are talking, had too much Gratitude to
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
here without Indignation. This I take to be the Provocation which moved the <HI>Examiner</HI> to utter this reproachful Language against him; among which he falls into the Error of saying, <HI>He outlived his Works; but Works of his, which outlive him</HI>, will let us into the <HI>Secret</HI> of this <HI>cruel Behaviour</HI>. The <HI>Medley</HI> was often writ∣ten by (Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>) this <HI>active Enemy</HI> of the <HI>Examiner</HI>, in which so many gross <HI>Fals∣hoods</HI> of <HI>that</HI> Writer were detected, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>MEDLEY NO. 41,</HI> relating to the Act of <HI>Indemnity</HI>. See also <HI>MEDLEY NO. 443,</HI> concerning the <HI>State Loans</HI>.</NOTE> that he had recourse to <HI>Detraction</HI> rather than a <HI>just Defense</HI> of himself, for which he had been call∣ed upon by Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> in several subse∣quent Papers.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears, that the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Treatment of this Gentleman, is as just as it would be in a Felon to publish a Libel against the late Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI>, for passing Sen∣tence upon him to be burnt in the Cheek. The <HI>Examiner</HI> has Sense enough tho' not Grace enough, to know, that to <HI>deserve</HI>, not to <HI>suffer</HI> Punishment, is truly shameful; but none but a Man enraged, as in the supposed Case of the Fe∣lon, and incapable of Remorse and Shame, could forget all Regards to the Advantage his Adver∣sary had in the Dispute, all Tenderness with Relation to a Man's private Affairs, so far as to mention the Particulars of the Gentleman's <HI>Sis∣Sister</HI>,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
and his Passion for an <HI>Actress</HI>. This Account with his <HI>Sister</HI>, I am very sure the <HI>Examiner</HI> can be no Judge of, nor any one but the Gentleman himself. The Offence his Passions (for Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>) gave, to all who es∣teemed him, is to be lamented, but not to be mentioned with these Aggravations, especially after his Death, and that when he who speaks professes himself an Enemy. But the <HI>Exami∣ner</HI> takes upon him to be a <HI>Champion</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI>, and must not allow such Sins to be ve∣nial; yet at the same time he should have consi∣dered, that the other Party would recriminate, and have reflected, that there are too many of the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s <HI>Side</HI>, who do not behave them∣selves as if they were under <HI>Vows</HI> of <HI>Chastity</HI>. I know as <HI>sly one</HI> among his great Friends, that loves a Wench as well as ever did old <HI>Rowley</HI>, (King <HI>Charles</HI> II.) Besides <HI>him</HI>, there is <HI>another</HI>, who finds Leisure from his weighty Affairs to strole among the Stews, or, as some will have it, neglects his Writing now and then, to toy with the Business of a Nation. But this dull Fel∣low, the <HI>Examiner</HI>, has so little Sense of what the impartial World thinks of him and his Per∣formance, that he gives himself an Air of Talking by way of good Humour. In the Beginning of the same Paper, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. <HI>The</HI> Examiner <HI>of</HI> Feb. 9<HI>th</HI>, 1712-13. <HI>abovementioned</HI>.</NOTE> the pretty Wanton is in a laughing Vein, and with a

<P>I THINK my self obliged to take off the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s last Aspersion of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>; (not spoken to in the foregoing excellent Defense it is this most notorious Falshood, that — <HI>He threw away the Vouchers of his Office</HI>, which I hereby solemnly declare he never could do, as never having a <HI>Voucher</HI> in his Custody, there∣fore could not lose <HI>one</HI>. This being a <HI>Charge</HI> always committed by the <HI>Auditors</HI> to their <HI>Officers</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Deputies were known to be Men of the most scrupu∣lous Care imaginable: He <HI>himself</HI> being es∣teemed by all who knew him, for which I par∣ticularly appeal to the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>Cus∣toms</HI>, to be the most exact of any Man in all the Affairs he undertook. Indeed it was im∣possible for it to be otherwise, there not being in his Time, a Gentleman of better Sense, more solid Judgment, and quicker Dispatch in Business, during the Intervals of Wit and Pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>A TRUE Copy of his <HI>last Will and Testament</HI>, hereunto annexed, sufficiently justifies the re∣gular and honest Disposition of that small For∣tune whereof he died possessed.</P>
<P>HAVING thus vindicated the Memory of this excellent Person, as well as Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Behaviour to him, I shall not presume to add any thing farther of my own to his Character, but conclude with letting the Reader know that Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Corps was interred in the Church of <HI>Chertsey</HI> in the County of <HI>Sur∣rey</HI>, where his Grant-Father (Sir <HI>Arthur Maynwaring</HI>) and his Father (<HI>Charles Mayn∣waring</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) were likewise buried, and where they had heretofore a plentiful Estate and fine Seat. His Obsequies were performed with great Privacy, answerable more to his Modes∣ty than his Merit: He never affected Pomp living, and those who had the Direction of his Funeral, took care to fulfil this his last Re∣quest, as they had done all others in his Life-time, with the utmost Justice and Honour.</P>
<P>HE was born at <HI>Ightfield</HI>, in the County of <HI>Salop, Ann.</HI> 1668, <HI>Obitt</HI> 1712, <HI>Aetat</HI>. XLIV. Those who are desirous to know more Par∣ticulars concerning him, and his Writings, may consult his Life and Posthumous Works, published by Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI>, in the Year 1715, 8<HI>vo</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>THE <HI>Distress'd Mother</HI> seemed now to be the Case of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, both on and off the Stage. For, tho' the <HI>Town-Talk</HI> was wholly bent upon Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s making her Ex∣ecutrix of his Will, it must surely be acknow∣ledged, that Two Thousand Pounds was no such mighty Sum to bring up an Orphan, from Seven Years old, suitable to the most ardent Wishes of his Father, which, in every Respect, his Mother has fully accomplished.</P>
<P>I THINK I cannot close the Subject in de∣bate more properly, than by applying to all <HI>Intermeddlers</HI> in Affairs which no ways con∣cern them, a short <HI>Essay</HI> of Mr. <HI>Maynwar∣ing</HI>'s in the <HI>Medley</HI> No. 33.</P>
<Q>Of MODESTY and JUSTICE.</Q>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Law</HI> mentioned by <HI>Plato</HI>, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> is said to have enacted in his own Name: <HI>That, if any Man appeared plainly to be incapable of</HI> Modesty <HI>or</HI> Justice, <HI>he should immediately be knocked o' the Head as a common Pestilence</HI>. The Account <HI>Plato</HI> gives of it is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>HE is describing the first State of Hu∣man Society: How <HI>Mankind</HI> built Towns to defend themselves from <HI>Beasts</HI>; and how,
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
in a more than brutal manner, they after∣wards fell upon one another: And at last, he says, <HI>Jupiter</HI>, justly fearing that the whole Race of <HI>Mankind</HI> would be destroyed, ordered <HI>Mercury</HI> to go to them, and to carry along with him <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI>, as the best Support and Ornament of their new-built Cities, and the firmest Bond of their own mu∣tual Friendship. <HI>Mercury</HI> upon this Occa∣sion asked <HI>Jupiter</HI>, in what manner he should bestow <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Modesty</HI> upon <HI>Mankind</HI>: Whether, said he, as the <HI>Arts</HI> are divided, shall I shall divide these <HI>Virtues</HI>, which are indeed of two Kinds, and shall I give to some Men <HI>one</HI>, to some the <HI>other</HI>, as we see by Experience, that one skilful Physician is sufficient for a great many of the Ignorant, and so of other <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Professions</HI>? or, shall I so divide them a∣mong the whole Race of <HI>Mankind</HI>, as that eve∣ry <HI>single</HI> Person may have a Share in them? Divide them in <HI>that manner</HI>, says <HI>Jupiter</HI>, and let <HI>all Mankind</HI> be Partakers of them: For it these <HI>Virtues</HI> were only conveyed to a <HI>few</HI>, as the Arts and <HI>Sciences</HI> are given, it would be im∣possible for any Cities to subsist; Therefore I would have you go farther, and establish a Law in my Name, <HI>That whoever cannot be made to partake of</HI> Modesty <HI>and</HI> Justice, <HI>shall be destroyed as a Plague of the Republick</HI>.</P>
<P>THE Application of this most excellent <HI>Fable</HI>, is, that it would be much more com∣mendable
<PB N="40" REF="41" MS="y"/>
in all Persons to have the <HI>Modesty</HI> of leaving the Administration of <HI>Justice</HI> to those to whom it peculiarly belongs, and to mind only their own Business.</P>
<P>To return to the Stage. Before this Time Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> had not only quit∣ted the Theatre, but also the Stage of Life. I remember a Passage in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Henry Cromwell</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> that upon hearing of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Death, he says,

<P>THE next Capital Part, in which Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> adorned the <HI>British</HI> Theatre, was in that beautiful Transition from <HI>Hector</HI>'s Wi∣dow, to become a Queen of <HI>England</HI>.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> became so universally accept∣able to the Town, both in Comedy and Trage∣dy, that she was over-loaded with Parts; and, obliged to quit the less considerable ones, espe∣cially in some Plays, wherein, by her Appear∣ance only, in speaking an <HI>Epilogue</HI>, she kept them alive a little while, but afterwards they were wholly laid aside.</P>

<Q>“She was always well drest: The Make of her Mind very much contributed to the Ornament of her Body.

was full of Attraction, but more of Allure∣ment. There was such a Composure in her Looks, and Propriety in her Dress, that you would think it impossible she should change the Garb you one Day see her in, for any thing so be coming, till you next Day see her in another. There was no other Mystery in this, but that however she was apparell'd, her self was the same.

<P>THERE happened a very remarkable Inci∣dent in the Representation of the <HI>Conscious Lo∣vers</HI>, which Sir <HI>Richard</HI> takes particular Notice of in his Preface, and I shall give it in his own Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“This Comedy was in every Part excellent∣ly performed; and there needs no other Ap∣plause of the Actors, but that they excelled according to the Dignity and Difficulty of the Character they represented:—The Tears which were shed, on this Occasion, flow∣ed from Reason and good Sense, and Men ought not to be laughed at for weeping, till we are come to a more clear Notion of what is to be imputed to the <HI>Hardness</HI> of the Head and the <HI>Softness</HI> of the Heart; and I think it was very politely said of Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, to one who told him there was a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Brigadier General <HI>Charles Churchill</HI>.</NOTE> <HI>General</HI> weeping for <HI>Indiana</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Part.</NOTE>—<HI>I'll warrant he'll fight ne'er the worse for that</HI>.

<P>AMONG the many Apologies for the <HI>Stage</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Oldelfid</HI> always preferred that humorous one given by Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, in his Discourse upon Comedy, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“POETRY alone, and chiefly the <HI>Drama</HI>, lies open to the Insults of all Pretenders; she was one of Nature's eldest Offsprings, whence by her Birthright, and plain Simpli∣city,

she pleads a genuine Likeness to her Mother. Born in the Innocence of Time, she provided not against the Assaults of suc∣ceeding Ages; and, depending altogether on the generous End of her Invention, neg∣lected those secret Supports and serpentine Devices used by other Arts, that wind themselves into Practice for more subtile and politick Designs: <HI>Naked she came into the World</HI>, and it is to be feared, like its Profes∣”sors, <HI>will go Naked out</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>I have often heard Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> mention the many agreeable Hours she had spent in Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Company. The Original Parts she had in his Plays, were only Two; <HI>Silvia</HI> in the <HI>Recruting Officer</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Sullen</HI> in the <HI>Stra∣tagem</HI>: Most of his Comedies being written before Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s coming on the Stage; and in the Old Parts, as already observed, she succeeded Mrs. <HI>Verbruggen</HI>, whose Maiden Name was <HI>Percival</HI>, and afterwards <HI>Mountfort</HI>.</P>
<P>Of this Gentlewoman, I am naturally led in∣to the Relation of one melancholy Scene of her Life, in which I believe no Parallel can be found either in Ancient or Modern History.

Under this, almost insuperable, Affliction, she was introduced to the good Queen <HI>Mary</HI>, who being, as she was pleased to say, <HI>struck to the Heart</HI> upon receiving Mrs: <HI>Mount∣fort</HI>'s Petition, immediately granted all that was in her Power, a Remission of her Father's Exe∣cution for that of Transportation. But Fate had so ordered it, that poor Mrs. <HI>Mountfort</HI> was to lose both Father and Husband. For as Mr. <HI>Percival</HI> was going abroad, he was so weakened by his Imprisonment, that he was taken sick on the Road, and died at <HI>Portsmouth</HI>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fatality</HI> which happens to the <HI>Shedders</HI> of <HI>Blood</HI>, I have alway remarked as a certain Effect of the Divine Vengance; and therefore all Gentlemen who are apt to draw their Swords upon the most trivial Occasions, would do well to consider two or three Accidents I shall here lay before them.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they would please to remember Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s Catastrophe; who, as Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI> fell by his Hands, he fell in the Duel between him and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>, himself sending the Challenge.</P>
<P N="2">2. At a Representation of the <HI>Scornful La∣dy</HI> some Years ago, for the Benefit of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, many Persons of Distinction were be∣hind the Scenes. Among others Beau <HI>Fielding</HI> came, and being always mighty ambitious of shewing his <HI>fine Make and Shape</HI>, as himself
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
used vainly to talk, he very closely pressed for∣ward upon some Gentlemen, but in particular upon one Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI>, a Barrister of <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI>, an Acquaintance of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> being a Gentleman of quick Resent∣ment, told <HI>Fielding</HI> he used him rudely; upon which, he laid his Hand upon his Sword, but Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> instantly drew and gave <HI>Fielding</HI> a Wound of twelve Inches deep in the Belly. This putting the Audience in∣to the greatest Consternation, <HI>Mr. Fulwood</HI> was with much Intreaty persuaded to leave the Place. At length, out of Respect to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> he did so, and went to the Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, where the same Eve∣ning the <HI>Libertine</HI> was acted. Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> went into the Pit, and in a very few Minutes cast his Eye upon one Captain <HI>Cusack</HI>, to whom he had an old Grudge, and there demanded Satisfaction of him. Captain <HI>Cusack</HI> without the least Hesitation obeyed the Summons. They went into the Field, and in less than half an Hour, Word was brought into the House, that Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> was killed on the Spot, and Captain <HI>Cusack</HI> had made his Esape.</P>
<P N="3">3. The last Instance I shall produce is in the Case of the late Lord Chief Justice <HI>Pine</HI>, of <HI>Ireland</HI>, who, when he was a Student of <HI>Lin∣coln's-Inn</HI>, in those Walks, killed the eldest Son of one of the finest Gentleman in <HI>England</HI>. I
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
beg to be excused from naming, him because he was my near Relation. However, the <HI>Weight</HI> of <HI>Blood</HI> hung so heavy upon Mr. <HI>Pine</HI>, that he declared, he could not live in <HI>England</HI>, and went over to <HI>Ireland</HI>, in which Kingdom in∣deed he made his Fortune; but an over-ruling Power dampt all his Joys, even to the Day of his Death, because the Price of Blood was re∣paid in his own Family, his eldest Son being killed in a Duel in <HI>Ireland</HI>.</P>
<P>As these accidental Digressions will not be without their Use, I hope they will not be judg∣ed in this Place impertinent, our Theatres be∣ing too often the Scene of Actions of this Kind.</P>
<P>BUT let us now again resume the pleasing Entertainment given by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. To Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI>'s excellent Tragedy of <HI>Jane Shore</HI>, she spoke the following <HI>Epilogue</HI>, and how she charmed throughout the whole Play, every Spectator must remember!</P>

<P><Q>“IN your Memoirs of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> it may not be amiss to insert the following Facts, the Truth of which you may depend. Her Father, Captain <HI>Oldfield</HI>, not only run out all the Military, but likewise the Paternal Bounds of his Fortune, having a pretty Estate in Houses in <HI>Pall-Mall</HI>. It was wholly owing to Cap∣tain <HI>Farquhar</HI>, that ever Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> became an Actress, from the following Incident. Din∣ing
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
one Day at her Aunt's, who kept the Mitred Tavern in <HI>St. James's-Market</HI>, he hear Miss <HI>Nanny</HI> reading a Play behind the Bar with so proper an Emphasis, and such agreeable Turns suitable to each Character, that he swore the Girl was cut out for the Stage; to which she had before always expres∣sed an Inclination, being very desirous to try her Fortune that Way. Her Mother, the next Time she saw Captain <HI>Vanbrugh</HI>, who had a great Respect for the Family, told him what was Captain <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Advice; upon which he desired to know whether, in the Plays she read, her Fancy was most pleased with Tragedy or Comedy. Miss being called in, said, Comedy; she hav∣ing at that Time gone through all <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Comedies; and the Play she was reading when Captain <HI>Farquhar</HI> dined there, was, <HI>The Scornful Lady</HI>. Captain <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> shortly after recommended her to Mr. <HI>Christopher Rich</HI>, who took her into the House, at the Allowance but of Fifteen Shil∣lings <HI>per</HI> Week. However, her agreeable Figure, and the Sweetness of her Voice, soon gave her the Preference, in the Opinion of the whole Town, to all our young Actresses; and his Grace the late Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI>, being pleased to speak to Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> in her

<P>Having already mention'd Miss <HI>Campion</HI>'s good Fortune, in being honoured with the Friendship of the Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>, I am here to observe, that a very short Time put a Period to her Happiness.</P>
<P>Paying some Visits, last Summer, to my Friends in <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI>, (as the Monu∣ments of the Dead never escape my Notice, in <HI>Latimer</HI>'s Church in that County, I found Miss <HI>Campion</HI> was buried. She was taken off in her Bloom, by a Hectic-Fever, under which she languished four Months, being but Nine∣teen Years of Age. Her Endowments, both of Mind and Body, are very elegantly delineat∣ed in the following Inscription, upon a very neat Marble Tablature, erected to her Memory in the Church above mentioned, by his Grace <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>.</P>

<P>HIS Grace of <HI>Devonshire</HI> did not long sur∣vive Miss <HI>Campion</HI>, dying in about a Year af∣ter her. This Amour, and the Duke's Po∣litical Character, drew upon Dr. <HI>White Ken∣net</HI>, late Bishop of <HI>Peterborough</HI>, some very se∣vere Reflections, on Account of the Sermon he preached at his Funeral in the Church of <HI>All∣hallows</HI> in <HI>Derby, Sept.</HI> 5. 1707. I shall not load these Papers with a Recital of what has been said <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con</HI>, by Pamphleteers, but content myself, and I hope the Reader, in giv∣ing a short State of the <HI>Case</HI>, as it is very handsomely drawn up, with regard to the Me∣mories
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
both of the <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal</HI> Peer, by the Writer of Bishop <HI>Kennet</HI>'s Life. —<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bishop <HI>Kennet</HI>'s Life, Printed in Octavo, 1730. pag. 35. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI></NOTE> "A growing Set of People, were disposed to dislike every thing he wrote or did: For the Times were now come, when Parties judged of Actions and Writings, not by the Merit of the Performances, but by the Affection or Prejudice they bore to the Name of the Authors of them. He was now stampt for a <HI>Whig-Writer</HI>; which was as bad as the being a <HI>Republican</HI>, and a <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI>; and that was <HI>worse</HI>, than the being a <HI>Papist</HI>. Many of our best Prelates and Di∣vines have suffered under the same Prejudices of Malice and Ignorance. When their Political Writings have offended, then the Party run down all their other Performances what∣soever. When once angry, they catch at new Causes, and fresher Pretences of being more angry; like Children and other People of no Command upon themselves, they are scratching of a <HI>new</HI> Wound, because of an Itching in the <HI>old</HI> Sore."</P>
<P>IT was under this Disadvantage that Doctor <HI>Kennet</HI> was called to preach a <HI>Funeral Ser∣mon</HI> for the Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>, from which he excused himself, as a Stranger to that noble Family, and till then utterly unknown to them. But it appeared that a Reverend Prelate had re∣commended him to that Duty, and had un∣dertaken
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
to give him such Instructions, as might enable him to speak with Truth and proper Observations of that Great Man. Upon this Encouragement, he complied with the im∣portunate Request, and upon a short Warning, amidst the Necessity of asking many Questions, and making many Visits, he drew up a serious Sermon, and attended the very solemn Funeral to <HI>Derby</HI>, delivering the Sermon before a very full Audience of the neighbouring Gentry, who could best judge of the Character given of that noble Peer; and in the same Evening, one of them at the Table, in the Name of the Rest, thanked the Preacher, and told him that they, in that County, had been Witnesses of the Truth of the most material Things he had so well spoken of the late Duke: And it was by their Report, and the concurrent Tes∣timony of that Part of the Family that attend∣ed those Obsequies, that his late Grace the Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>, a Peer of great Prudence and Probity, generously approved of that last Office and desired the Doctor to publish the Sermon; to which he submitted with the less Fear of Of∣fence, because all he said relating to his Life was either suggested or allowed by the then Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI>, who was intimately acquaint∣ed with his Grace's Conduct; and all that he observed concerning his Sickness and Death, was communicated to him by the Eye-Witness
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
and faithful Judge of them, the then Lord Bi∣shop of <HI>Ely</HI>. Upon their Authority, and Appro∣bation, the Doctor published his Sermon, and confirmed the main Subject of it, by casting in some Historical Collections relating to the De∣scent and Progress of that Noble Family; to which he made a modest Dedication to the late Duke; which he (who would have despis∣ed Flattery, and abhorred Falshood) was so well pleased with, that he had a Respect and Favour for the Doctor, and shewed it in a very kind Manner, by recommending him to the Queen for the Deanery of <HI>Peterborough</HI>, soon after vacant by the Death of Dr. <HI>Freeman</HI>, which we may suppose was the more easily obtained of her Majesty, as being her Chaplain in Ordi∣nary, by the Recommendation of the Lord Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Godolphin</HI>. This Preferment, tho' not so much to be envied, raised the fiercer Spite and Malice of the Party against him: Libels and peevish Sermons point∣ed at him. They got young Men to tune the <HI>Oxford</HI> Pulpit, and let out their University Press to the Printing, or Reprinting a sorry Libel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hazard of a Death-Bed Repentance.</NOTE> of poor <HI>John Dunton</HI>'s against the deccased Duke and his Funeral Preacher. Some said that he had <HI>covered all the Vices</HI> of that great Man, which was so far from being true, that he plain∣ly intimated them. — "That this was the true Bottom of all the Clamour against Dean
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
<HI>Kennet</HI>, both then and afterwards, is evident from the many violent Pamphlets and Libels pub∣lished against him." And, it is meerly to shew the Inveteracy of Prejudice on all Occasions, and of Party Malice in some, that the Reader has been troubled with this Digression; but, with candid Minds it will have its due Weight and Use. For as to the Dean's palliating all the Duke's Vices, thereby insinuating, that he was privy to his Grace's Amour with Miss <HI>Campion</HI>, and also that he was the Author of her Monumental Inscription;
<Q>“These Ca∣lumnies he was so little concerned in, that he has often said, he had never before heard ”of them.</Q>
The Intrigue he was wholly a Stranger to, and as to the Inscription, it is well known to be the Performance of his Grace's own elegant Pen.</P>
<P>We have been lately told, by a noted <HI>State-Writer</HI>, that,
<Q>“Persons who move in a Supe∣rior Orb, will not be mewed up, nor be barred those Pleasures, which every Inferior ”Person thinks he has a Right to pursue.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Observations on the Writings of the <HI>Craftsman</HI>.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Manley</HI> tells us, in her Life, that the Dutchess of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Favourite, and the on∣ly Man she loved, was Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> the Play∣er; tho' she had the Power of Captivating Princes. And tho' as Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> sings, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dispensary, a Poem.</NOTE> the Stage is a Spot,
<Q><PB N="65" REF="66"/>
<L>Where Purple Emperors in Buskins tread,</L>
<L>And rule imaginary Worlds for Bread.</L></Q>
Yet, many are the Instances of <HI>real</HI> Monarchs, and Persons of the <HI>first</HI> Distinction, who have felt the Power of Beauty from the Stage, and fallen willing Victims to a Theatrical <HI>Venus</HI>.</P>
<P>The Admirers of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> may justly be said to be innumerable, as her Performance on the Stage was allowed to be inimitable. But to point out the Persons who shared the Esteem of her private Friendship, is not the Intent of these Papers, as I have publickly declared. The Gentleman who has lived with her since the Death of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> made it his sole Busi∣ness and Delight to place her in the same Rank of Reputation (to which her own natural Deportment greatly contributed,) with Persons of the best Condition; and the Mention she has made of him, in her Will, sufficiently confirms her just Value for him.</P>
<P>Among the other <HI>Dramatical Memoirs</HI>, here∣in recited, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> having been mention∣ed on Account of his most excellent Writings; I think my self, in Justice to <HI>his</HI> Memory (as well as to the <HI>Gentleman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capt.</HI> Shrimton.</NOTE> who married his Widow) to set the Affair of his Marrying, <HI>just at the Eve of his Death</HI>, (as Major <HI>Pack</HI> well expresses it) in a true Light.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that poor Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was <HI>incapable</HI>, as he told the Lady,

of rendering her <HI>due Benevolence</HI>; but he was very unwilling to be rendered <HI>incapable</HI> of pay∣ing his Debts (through his Nephew's ungene∣rous Treatment of him) when he knew what was in his Power; so that it must embalm his Memory, with the greatest <HI>Honour</HI>, when it is known, that <HI>Justice</HI> was the only Motive of his changing his Condition.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this Article with <HI>some Circumstances of the last Act of</HI> Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley</HI>'s <HI>Life</HI>, as related by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See A Letter to Mr. BLOUNT of <HI>Jan.</HI> 21, 1715-16.</NOTE>
<Q>“He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would marry as soon as his Life was despaired of: Accord∣ingly, a few Days before his Death he under∣went the Ceremony; and joined together those Two Sacraments, which wise Men say, should be the Last we receive; for if you observe, <HI>Matrimony</HI> is placed after <HI>Extream Unction</HI> in our <HI>Catechism</HI>, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they ought to be taken. The old Man then lay down, satisfied in the Conscience of having by this one Act paid his just Debts, obliged a Wo∣man who, he was told, had Merit, and shewn an Heroic Resentment of the ill Usage of his next Heir. Some Hundred Pounds which he had with the Lady, discharged those Debts; a Jointure of 400 l. a Year mader Her a Recompence; and his Nephew he left to
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
comfort himself as well as he could, with the miserable Remains of a Mortgaged Estate. I saw our Friend twice after this was done, less peevish in his Sickness than he used to be in his Health; neither much <HI>afraid</HI> of Dy∣ing, nor (which in him had been more like∣ly) much <HI>ashamed</HI> of <HI>Marrying</HI>. The Eve∣ning before he <HI>expired</HI>, he called his young Wife to the Bed-side, and earnestly intreat∣ed her not to deny him one Request, the Last he should make. Upon her Assurance of Consenting to it, he told her, <HI>My Dear, it is only this, that you will never marry an old Man again</HI>. I cannot help remarking, that <HI>Sickness</HI>, which often destroys both <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI>, yet seldom has Power to remove that Talent which we call <HI>Humour</HI>: Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> shewed <HI>his</HI> even in this <HI>Last Com∣pliment</HI>; tho' I think his Request a little hard, for <HI>why should he bar her from doubling her ”Jointure on the same easy Terms</HI>?</Q>
But Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should have observed, that the <HI>Lady</HI> dou∣bled her Fortune much better, by marrying a <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> whose <HI>Commission</HI> was more than equivalent to her Jointure.</P>

<P>The Case of Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Executor, and the unjust litigious Usage he met with, is, I think, a sufficient <HI>Memento</HI> for all Persons whatever, who have any Effects to leave behind them, how prudently circumspect they ought to be in settling their Affairs before their Decease. Tho' notwithstanding all the Care
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
and Caution imaginable, where there is a Fel∣low, who wears a <HI>Corinthian Forehead</HI>, such a one as Capt. <HI>Shrimpton</HI> had to do with, a Man of Honour will find it very difficult to get out of his Clutches. Mr. <HI>Otway</HI>, in his Tragedy of <HI>Venice Preserved</HI> has described the Misery of a Man, whose Effects are in the Hands of the Law, with great Spirit. The Bitterness of be∣ing the Scorn and Laughter of base Minds, the Anguish of being insulted by Men hardened be∣yond the Sense of Shame or Pity, and the In∣jury of a Man's Fortune being wasted, under Pretence of Justice, are excellently aggravat∣ed in the following Speech of <HI>Pierre</HI> to <HI>Jaffeir</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>I pass'd this very Moment by <HI>Thy</HI> Doors,</L>
<L>And found them guarded by a Troop of Vil∣lains;</L>
<L>The Sons of public Rapine were destroy'd</L>
<L>They told me, by the Sentence of the Law,</L>
<L>They had Commission to seize all thy Fortune.</L>
<L>Here, stood a Ruffian with a horrid Face,</L>
<L>Lording it o'er a Pile of massy Plate,</L>
<L>Tumbled into a Heap for Public Sale.</L>
<L>There, was Another, making Villainous Jests</L>
<L>At thy Undoing: He had ta'en Possession</L>
<L>Of all thy antient most Domestic Ornaments:</L>
<L>Rich Hangings, intermix'd and wrought with Gold;</L>
<L>The very Bed, which on thy Wedding-Night</L>
<L>Received Thee to the Arms of <HI>Belvidera</HI>!</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="74"/>The Scene of all thy Joys, was violated</L>
<L>By the coarse Hands of filthy Dungeon Villains</L>
<L>And thrown amongst the common Lumber.</L></Q>
<P>I shall put an End to this just Complaint, by acquainting the Reader, that the Lord Chan∣cellor <HI>Macclesfield</HI> was pleased to make a <HI>De∣cree</HI> in favour of Capt. <HI>Shrimton</HI>.</P>
<P>We now come to the last Original Part of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield. James Thomson</HI>, an ingeni∣ous <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman (Author of <HI>The Seasons</HI>) in the <HI>Preface</HI> to his Tragedy of <HI>Sophonisba</HI>, thus delivers himself:
<Q>“I cannot conclude without owning my Obligations to those concerned in the <HI>Representation</HI>. They have indeed done me more than Justice. What∣ever was designed as amiable and engaging in <HI>Massinissa</HI>, shines out in Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Ac∣tion. Mrs. <HI>Olfideld</HI>, in the Character of <HI>So∣phonisba</HI>, has excelled what, even in the Fond∣ness of an Author, I could either wish or im∣agine. The Grace, Dignity, and happy Variety of her Action, have been universally ”applauded, and are truly admirable.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophonisba</HI> was the <HI>last</HI> Original Character in which She appeared on the Stage: But, the <HI>last</HI> Time of her Performance was on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 28th Day of <HI>April</HI>, 1730, when Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI>'s excellent Comedy, The <HI>Provok'd Wife</HI>, was acted for the Benefit of Mr. <HI>Charke</HI>, wherein she acted the Part of Lady <HI>Brute</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75"/>I have been assured by some of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s most intimate Female-Friends, that she had for some Years languished under a very delcin∣ing State of Health, tho' not from any Cause which Malice may suggest. The natural Chear∣fulness of her Temper made her ward off eve∣ry Attack with the greatest Alacrity. Yet, ma∣ny times, when she has been playing a Part, and received the universal Applause of an Au∣dience, the Tears have fallen from her Cheeks with the Anguish of Pain she felt; such was her Willingness to oblige in her Profession.</P>
<P>Upon the very Approach of her last Illness, she most earnestly requested her Physicians not to flatter her, but to give her their Opinions freely, <HI>what, they thought of her Case</HI>. And when they told her, <HI>they feared the Fatality of it</HI>, she replied, without the least Shock, or Emotion, She <HI>acquiesced in the Lot Providence had assigned her; and hoped she should bear her Afflictions patiently</HI>.</P>
<P>Having this previous Notice of her Change, she <HI>set her House in Order</HI>, and made such an equitable Distribution of her Estate, as is in eve∣ry Respect highly commendable.</P>
<P>Her most intimate and dear Friend, Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI>, attended her almost from the Begin∣ning to the End of her melancholy Six Months Languishment. This Gentlewoman was brought upon the Stage through the Recom∣mendation of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, and in a most a∣greeable Manner entertained the Town for
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
some Years, being esteemed, <HI>in her Stile of Playing</HI>, one of the most eminent Actresses. The Violence of an Asthmatical Indisposition obliged her to leave the Stage. She retired to <HI>Watford</HI> in <HI>Hertfordshire</HI>, about fifteen Miles from <HI>London</HI>, where she now lives, and from whence, upon my writing to her, she has been pleased to favour me with the following Letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. CURLL,</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Watford,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 29, 1730.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours concerning Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, whose Memory, I hope, will never be forgotten by any that had the Pleasure of being known to her.</P>
<P>The Account I can give of her Behaviour, during the Time of her Sickness, is but short, tho' strictly true.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Funeral</HI> I never heard her once men∣tion; but <HI>Christian Fortitude</HI> she had sufficient; for tho' she had no <HI>Priest</HI>, she did the Office of one to the <HI>Last</HI>.</P>
<P>When her <HI>Dissolution drew nigh</HI>, and the <HI>Lamp of Life waxed dim</HI>, she then expressed her self in <HI>broken</HI> Words and <HI>pious</HI> Meditations, in the most <HI>moving</HI> and <HI>strongest</HI> Manner you can imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/>It may be justly said she <HI>prayed without ceasing</HI>. She was all Goodness: The best of Daughters, the best of Mothers, and the best of Friends. Oh! that I had Words to sound forth her Praise; but that, <HI>Sir</HI>, is a Task you have taken in hand, and I do not doubt your doing Justice to her Memory.</P>
<P>As to my own Time on the Stage, to the best of my Remembrance, I came into the House in the Year 1702; and my ill State of Health obliged me to quit it in 1720.</P>
<P>A Copy of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Picture is at your Service, and I shall gladly accept of that ex∣cellent Copy you are about to draw of her; it will give vast Pleasure to,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your very humble Servant</HI>, M. SAUNDERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> was at length released from her Earthly Bonds, expiring very early on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, <HI>October</HI> 23. 1730.</P>
<P>As the Nicety of Dress was her Delight when living, she was as nicely dressed after her De∣cease; being by Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI>'s Direction thus laid in her Coffin. She had on a very fine <HI>Brussels</HI> Lace Head; a Holland Shift with a Tucker, and double Ruffles of the same Lace; a Pair of New Kid-Gloves, and her Body wrapped up in a Winding Sheet.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78"/>On her Coffin, was this Inscription:
<Q>ANNE OLDFIELD, Aetatis 47.</Q></P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 27th of <HI>October</HI>, the Corps was carried from her House, in <HI>Grosvenor-Street</HI>, to the <HI>Jerusalem-Chamber Westminster</HI>, where it lay in State, and about Eleven o' Clock was conveyed to the Abbey: The Pall being supported by the Lord <HI>Delawar</HI>, Lord <HI>Harvey</HI>, the Right Honourable <HI>George Bubb Doddington, Charles Hedges</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Walter Carey</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Capt <HI>Elliot</HI>.</P>
<P>Her eldest Son, <HI>Arthur Maynwaring</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Chief Mourner. The Funeral Service was performed by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Barker</HI>, Senior Prebendary, then Resident.</P>
<P>Here I think my self obliged to expose the Insolence of that Weekly Libeller, the <HI>Grub∣street</HI> Journalist.</P>
<P>In his 44th Numb. <HI>Thursday Novemb.</HI> 5. he says, —
<Q>“A Place having been <HI>allowed</HI> the celebrated Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> in <HI>Westmin∣ster-Abbey;</HI> I hope, that on the fine Monu∣ment which is to be erected to her Memory, the Inscription will particularly mention the Christian, as well as Moral Virtues of that ”Lady.</Q>
This wretched Sneer can only af∣fect the Writer of it; and I wish when he comes
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
to die, that a Testimony as ample, and sincere, of his <HI>Christian Virtues</HI>, may be produced, as Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI> has given of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s; and as for her <HI>Moral Virtues</HI>, her <HI>Last Will and Testament</HI> is a Demonstration of her Justice.</P>
<P>Some Folks, it seems, much more <HI>scrupulous</HI> than <HI>conscientious</HI>, would have laid hold on an obsolete <HI>Popish</HI> Canon; which ordains, that <HI>no</HI> Stage Players <HI>should be buried in Churches</HI>. But I have been assured by Dr. <HI>Barker</HI> himself that he buried Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> very willingly, and with the greatest Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Place of her Interment is towards the <HI>West</HI> End of the <HI>South</HI> Isle, (near the Monu∣ment of Secretary <HI>Craggs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>) hard by the <HI>Consistory</HI>, or Spiritual-Court.</P>
<P>Taking Occasion, from these <HI>Three</HI> eminent Persons having never been <HI>married</HI>, a certain Gentleman, well known at <HI>Westminster</HI>, was very innocently witty; and threw down these Verses, written with a Pencil, upon Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI>'s Grave, after the Ceremony was over, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>If <HI>Penance</HI> in the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s <HI>Court</HI>, be fear'd,</L>
<L><HI>Congreve</HI>, and <HI>Craggs</HI>, and <HI>Oldfield</HI> will be scar'd</L>
<L>To find that at the <HI>Resurrection</HI> Day,</L>
<L>They've <HI>All</HI> so near the <HI>Consistory</HI> lay.</L></Q>
<P>The following Epitaph is supposed to come from the same Hand.</P>
<Q><PB N="77" REF="80"/>
<L>Hic Jacet (cito jacet hic) <HI>Oldfield,</HI></L>
<L>The Brightest Actress <HI>Britain</HI> e'er did yield.</L>
<L>In Parts diverting her chief Talent lay,</L>
<L>Wherein a Thousand Charms she did display.</L>
<L>Would every one in this degen'rate Age,</L>
<L>Whilst Acting here a Part on Life's Short Stage,</L>
<L>Like her exert, pursuing <HI>Nature</HI>'s <HI>Laws</HI>,</L>
<L>They'd meet at their last <HI>Exit</HI> like Applause.</L></Q>
<P>As to the <HI>Variety</HI> of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s <HI>Amours</HI>,
<Q>“such infamous Reports arise, from her be∣ing more lovely than the rest of <HI>her Sex</HI>, she was envied by such malicious Wretches; but all who knew her will confirm this Truth, that, she was never guilty of any ”base or ungenerous Action.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH is the Character I have had communi∣cated to me by a <HI>Gentlwoman</HI> whose Veracity is unquestionable; and whom, I am not asham∣ed to own, I have with great Satisfaction con∣sulted upon the present Occasion. She thus farther proceeds.</P>
<P><Q>“Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, like a prudent and just Pa∣rent, has equitably divided her Estate be∣tween her Two Sons, and only Children, <HI>Maynwaring</HI> and <HI>Churchill</HI>; for was I brought on my Oath, I would swear she had no other; and, as to <HI>Love Affairs</HI>, I do assure you, I know of none, but with the Fa∣thers of the Gentlemen here mentioned. As to the Cause of her Death, it cannot fall within the Bounds of Censure; for the Sur∣geons
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
when she was opened, made no other Report, than what had been reported by the Physicians; and it was a Ma∣lady known by every body to be incident to our Sex, although we were Vestals. These are all the Particulars I can relate either of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Publick or Private Behaviour. I have thrown in my Mite toward her Vin∣dication, tho' the Occasion for it gives me a great deal of Uneasiness; but they who cannot serve a Friend without a View of ”Interest, ought to be dispised.</Q></P>
