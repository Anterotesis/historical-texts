<L>On brazen Columns, and on Coins of Gold,</L>
<L>Let it in lasting Characters be told,</L>

<L>Near <HI>Woodstock</HI>'s Grotto, rais'd the stately Pile;</L>
<L>That his just QUEEN augmented his Renown</L>

<L>And that the <HI>Senate,</HI> anxious for his Fame,</L>

<L>Thro' five successive Reigns his Virtues ran,</L>

<L>Scorn'd to combine or lend his venal Hand;</L>
