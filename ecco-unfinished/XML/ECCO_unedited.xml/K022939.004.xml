<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO The first publication of this <HI>Epistle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS paper is a sort of bill of complaint, be∣gun many years since, and drawn up by snatches, as the several occasions offered. I had no thoughts of publishing it, till it pleased some Persons of Rank and Fortune [the Authors of <HI>Verses to the Imitator of Horace,</HI> and of an <HI>Epistle to a Doctor of Di∣vinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court]</HI> to attack, in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which, being public, the Public is judge) but my <HI>Per∣son, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> whereof, to those who know me not, a truer information may be requisite. Being divided between the necessity to say something of <HI>my∣self,</HI> and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task, I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle. If it have any thing pleasing, it will be that by which I am most desirous to please, the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Sentiment;</HI> and if any thing offensive, it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend▪ <HI>the vicious</HI> or <HI>the ungenerous.</HI></P>
<P>Many will know their own pictures in it, there be∣ing not a circumstance but what is true; but I have,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
for the most part, spared their <HI>Names,</HI> and they may escape being laughed at, if they please.</P>
<P>I would have some of them know, it was owing to the request of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine. However, I shall have this advantage, and honour, on my side, that whereas, by their proceeding, any abuse may be directed at any man, no injury can possibly be done by mine, since a name∣less Character can never be found out, but by its <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>likeness.</HI> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO Dr. ARBUTHNOT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Apology for himself and his Writings.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Ep. to Dr. Arbuthnot.]</HI> AT the time of publishing this Epistle, the Poet's patience was quite exhausted by the endless impertinence of Poetasters of all ranks and conditions; as well those who courted his favour, as those who envied his reputation. So that now he had resolved to quit his hands of both together, by the publication of a DUNCIAD. This design he commu∣nicated to his excellent Friend Dr. ARBUTHNOT, who, although as a man of Wit and Learning he might not have been dis∣pleased to see their common injuries revenged on this pernicious Tribe; yet, as our Author's Friend and Physician, wassolicitous of his ease and health; and therefore unwilling he should pro∣voke so large and powerful a party.</P>
<P>Their difference of opinion, in this matter, gives occasion to the following <HI>Dialogue.</HI> Where, in a natural and familiar detail of all his Provocations, both from flatterers and slanderers, our Author has artfully interwoven an Apology for his <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>poetic</HI> Character.</P>
<P>For after having told his case, and humourously applied to his Physician in the manner one would ask for a Receipt to kill Vermin, he strait goes on, in the common Character of Askers of advice, to tell his Doctor that he had already taken his party, and determined of his remedy. But using a preamble, and in∣troducing it (in the way of Poets) with a Simile, in which he names <HI>Kings, Queens, and Ministers of State,</HI> his Friend takes the alarm, begs him to forbear, to stick to his subject, and to be easy under so common a calamity.</P>
<P>To make so light of his disaster provokes the Poet: he breaks the thread of his discourse, which was to lead his Friend gently, and by degrees, into his project; and abruptly tells him the ap∣plication of his Simile, at once,
<Q><L>Out with it, <HI>Dunciad!</HI> let the secret pass, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
But recollecting the humanity and tenderness of his Friend, which, he apprehends, might be a little shocked at the apparent severity of such a proceeding, he assures him, that his good▪na∣ture is alarmed without a cause, for that nothing has less feeling than this sort of Offenders; which he illustrates in the Examples of a <HI>damn'd Poet,</HI> a <HI>detected Slanderer,</HI> a <HI>Table-Parasite,</HI> a <HI>Church-Buffo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and a <HI>Party-Writer</HI> [from ℣ 1 to 100.]</P>
<P>But, in this enumeration, coming again to <HI>Names,</HI> his Friend once more stops him, and bids him consider what hostilities this general attack will set on soot. So much the better, replies the Poet; for, considering <HI>the strong antipathy of bad to good,</HI> enemies they will always be, either open or secret: and it admits of no question, but a Slanderer is less hurtful than a Flatterer. For, says he (in a pleasant Simile addressed to his Friend's profession)
<Q><L>Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right,</L>
<L>It is the slaver kills, and not the bite.</L></Q>
And how abject and excessive the flattery of these creatures was, he shews, by observing, that they praised him even for his insirmities; his bad health, and his inconvenient shape [℣ 100 to 125.]</P>
<P>But still it might be said, that if he could bear this evil of Authorship no better, he should not have wrote at all. To this he answers, by lamenting the natural bent of his disposition, which, from his very birth, had drawn him so strongly towards <HI>Poetry,</HI> as if it were in execution of some secret decree of Heaven for crimes unknown. But though he offended in becoming an Author, he offended in nothing else. For his early verses were perfectly innocent and harmless,
<Q><L>Like gentle Fanny's was my flowing theme,</L>
<L>A painted mistress, or a purling stream.</L></Q>
Yet even then, he tells us, two enraged and hungry Critics fell upon him, without the least provocation. But this might have been borne, as the common lot of distinction. But it was <HI>his</HI> peculiar i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l-fortune to create a Jealousy in One, whom not only many good offices done by our Author to him and his friends, but a similitude of genius and studies might have inclined to a reciprocal affection and support. On the contrary, that other∣wise amiable Person, being, by nature, timorous and suspicious; by education a party-man; and, by the circumstances of fortune, beset with flatterers and pick-thanks; regarded our Author as his Rival, set up by a contrary Faction, with views destructive of public liberty, and his friends reputation. And all this, with as
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
little provocation from Mr. Pope's conduct in his poetic, as in his civil character.</P>
<P>For though he had got a Name (the reputation of which he agreeably rallies in the description he gives of it) yet he never, even when most in fashion, set up for a Patron, or a Dictator amongst the Wits; but still kept in his usual privacy; leaving <HI>the whole Castalian state,</HI> as he calls it, to a Mock-Mecenas, whom he next describes [℣ 125 to 261.]</P>
<P>And, struck with the sense of that dignity and felicity insepar∣able from the character of a true Poet, he breaks out into a passionate vow for a continuance of the full Liberty attendant on it. And to shew how well he deserves it, and how safely he might be trusted with it, he concludes his wish with a description of his temper and disposition [℣ 261 to 271.]</P>
<P>This naturally leads him to complain of his Friends, when they consider him in no other view than that of an <HI>Author:</HI> as if he had neither the same right to the enjoyments of life, the same concern for his highest interests, or the same dispositions of benevolence, with other people.</P>
<P>Besides, he now admonishes them, in his turn, that they do not consider to what they expose him, when they urge him to write on; namely, to the <HI>suspicions</HI> and the <HI>displeasure</HI> of a Court; who are made to believe, he is always writing; or at least to the foolish <HI>criticisms</HI> of court sycophants, who pretend to find him, by his style, in the immoral libels of every idle scribler: though he, in the mean time, be so far from countenancing such worthless trash in others, that he would be ready to execrate even his own best vein of poetry, if made at the expence of Truth or Innocence.</P>
<LG>
<L>Curst be the verse, how well so e'er it flow,</L>
<L>That tends to make one worthy man my foe;</L>
<L>Give Virtue scandal, Innocence a fear,</L>
<L>Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear.</L>
</LG>
<P>(Sentiments, which no efforts of genius, without the concur∣rence of the heart, could have expressed in strains so exquisitely sublime) that the sole object of his resentment was <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>baseness.</HI> In the detection of which, he artfully takes occasion to speak of <HI>that</HI> by which he himself had been injured and of∣fended: and concludes with the character of one who had wantonly outraged him, and in the most sensible manner [℣ 271 to 334.]</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
And here, moved again with fresh indignation at his slan∣derers, he takes the advice of Horace, <HI>sume superbiam qua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sitam meritis,</HI> and draws a fine picture of his moral and poetic conduct through life. In which he shews that not <HI>fame,</HI> but VIRTUE was the constant object of his ambition: that for this he opposed himself to all the violence of Cabals, and the treacheries of Courts: the various iniquities of which having distinctly speci∣fied, he sums them up in that most atrocious and sensible of all, [℣ 334 to 359]</P>
<LG>
<L>The whisper, that to greatness still too near,</L>
<L>Perhaps yet vibrates on his <HI>SOV'REIGN'S</HI> ear.</L>
<L>Welcome for thee, fair <HI>Virtue!</HI> all the past:</L>
<L>For thee, fair <HI>Virtue!</HI> welcome ev'n the last.</L>
</LG>
<P>But here again his Friend interrupts the strains of his divine enthusiasm, and desires him to clear up an objection made to his conduct, at Court. "That it was inhumane to insult the Poor, "and ill-breeding to affront the Great." To which he replies, That indeed, in his pursuit of <HI>Vice,</HI> he rarely considered how Knavery was circumstanced; but followed it, with his Vengeance, indifferently, whether it led to the Pillory, or the Drawing-Room [℣ 359 to 368.]</P>
<P>But lest this should give his Reader the idea of a savage in∣tractable Virtue, which could bear with nothing, and would pardon nothing, he takes to himself the shame of owning that he was of so easy a nature, as to be duped by the slenderest ap∣pearances, a pretence to <HI>Virtue</HI> in a <HI>witty Woman:</HI> so forgiving, that he had sought out the object of his beneficence in a <HI>personal Enemy:</HI> so humble, that he had submitted to the conversation of <HI>bad Poets:</HI> and so forbearing, that he had curbed in his re∣sentment under the most shocking of all calumnies, <HI>abuses on his Father and Mother</HI> [℣ 368 to 388.]</P>
<P>This naturally leads him to give a short account of their births, fortunes, and dispositions; which ends with the tenderest wishes for the happiness of his Friend; intermixed with the most pathetic description of that filial Piety, in the exercise of which he makes his own happiness to consist.</P>
<LG>
<L>Me let the tender office long engage</L>
<L>To rock the Cradle of reposing Age;</L>
<L>With lenient arts extend a Mother's breath,</L>
<L>Make Languor smile, and smooth the bed of Death;</L>

VER. 127. <HI>As yet a child,</HI> &amp;c.] He used to say, that he be∣gan to write verses further back than he could remember. When he was eight years old, Ogilby's Homer fell in his way, and delighted him extremely; it was followed by Sandys' Ovid; and the raptures these then gave him were so strong, that he spoke of them with pleasure ever after. About ten, being at school at Hide-park-corner, where he was much neglected, and suffered to go to the Comedy with the greater boys, he turned the transactions of the Iliad into a play, made up of a number of speeches from Ogilby's translation, tacked together with verses of his own. He had the address to persuade the upper boys to act it; he even prevailed on the Master's Gardener to re∣present Ajax; and contrived to have all the actors dressed after the pictures in his favourite Ogilby. At twelve he went with
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
his Father into the Forest: and then got first acquainted with the writings of Waller, Spencer, and Dryden; in the order I have named them. On the first sight of Dryden, he found he had what he wanted. His Poems were never out of his hands; they became his model; and from them alone he learnt the whole magic of his versification. This year he began an epic Poem, the same which Bp. Atterbury, long afterwards, per∣suaded him to burn.

<P>When in these latter ages, human learning raised its head in the West, and its tail, <HI>verbal criticism,</HI> was, of course, to rise with it; the madness of Critics soon became so offensive, that the sober stupidity of the monks might appear the more tolerable evil. <HI>J. Argyropylus,</HI> a mercenary Greek, who came to teach school in Italy, after the sacking of Constantinople by the Turks,
<PB N="21" REF="24" MS="y"/>
used to maintain that <HI>Cicero</HI> understood neither Philosophy nor Greek: while another of his Countrymen, <HI>J. Lascaris</HI> by name, threatened to demonstrate that <HI>Virgil</HI> was no Poet. Coun∣tenanced by such great examples, a French Critic afterwards un∣dertook to prove that <HI>Aristotle</HI> did not understand Greek, nor <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> Latin. It was the same discernment of spirit, which has since discovered that <HI>Josephus</HI> was ignorant of He∣brew; and <HI>Erasmus</HI> so pitiful a Linguist, that, <HI>Burman</HI> assures us, were he now alive, he would not deserve to be put at the head of a country school. For though time has strip'd the pre∣sent race of Pedants of all the real accomplishments of their pre∣decessors, it has conveyed down this spirit to them, unimpaired; it being found much easier to ape their manners, than to imitate their science. However, those earlier Ribalds raised an appe∣tite for the Greek language in the West: insomuch, that <HI>Her∣molaus Barbarus,</HI> a passionate admirer of it, and a noted Critic, used to boast, that he had invoked and raised the Devil, and puz∣zled him into the bargain, about the meaning of the Aristotelian ENTEAEXEIA. Another, whom <HI>Balzac</HI> speaks of, was as eminent for his Revelations: and was wont to say, that the meaning of such or such a verse, in <HI>Persius,</HI> no one knew but GOD and himself. While the celebrated <HI>Pomponius Laetus,</HI> in excess of Veneration for Antiquity, became a real Pagan, raised altars to Romulus, and sacrificed to the Gods of Latium: in which he was followed by our countryman, <HI>Baxter,</HI> in every thing, but in the expence of his sacrifices.</P>
<P>But if the Greeks cried down <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Italian Critics knew how to support his credit. Every one has heard of the childish excesses into which the ambition of being thought CICERONIANS carried the most celebrated Italians of this time. They abstained from reading the Scriptures for fear of spoiling their style: Cardinal <HI>Bembo</HI> used to call the Epistles of St. Paul by the contemptuous name of <HI>Epistolaccias, great overgrown Epistles.</HI> But ERASMUS cured their frenzy in that masterpiece of good sense, his <HI>Ciceronianus.</HI> For which (in the way Luna∣tics treat their Physicians) the elder <HI>Scaliger</HI> insulted him with all the brutal fury peculiar to his family and profession.</P>

His son <HI>Joseph,</HI> and <HI>Salmasius</HI> had indeed such endowments of nature and art, as might have raised modern learning to a rival∣ship with the ancient?

In a letter to <HI>Thuanus,</HI> speaking of two of them, <HI>Clavius</HI> and <HI>Lipsius,</HI> he calls the first, <HI>a monster of ignorance;</HI> and the other, <HI>a slave to the Jesuits, and an Idiot.</HI> But so great was his love of sacred <HI>amity</HI> at the same time, that he says, <HI>I still keep up my correspondence with him, notwithstand∣ing his Idiotry, for it is my principle to be constant in my friend∣ships—Je ne reste de luy escrire, nonobstant son Idioterie, d'autant que je suis constant en amiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The character he gives of his <HI>Chronology,</HI> in the same letter, is no less extraordinary: <HI>Vous vous pouvez assurer que nostre Eusebe sera un trésor des merveilles de la doctrine Chronologique.</HI> But this modest account of his own work, is nothing in comparison of the idea the Father gives his Bookseller of his own Person. Who, when he was preparing something of <HI>Julius Scaliger's</HI> for the Press, desired the Author would give him directions concerning his Picture, which was to be set before the book. Whose answer (as it stands in his col∣lection of Letters) is, that if the engraver could collect together the several graces of Massinissa, Xenophon, and Plato, he might then be enabled to give the public some faint and imperfect re∣semblance of his Person. Nor was <HI>Salmasius's</HI> judgment of his own parts less favourable to himself; as M. <HI>Colomies</HI> tells the story. This Critic, on a time, meeting two of his brethren, Mess. <HI>Gaulmin</HI> and <HI>Maussae,</HI> in the Royal Library at Paris, <HI>Gaul∣min,</HI> in a virtuous consciousness of their importance, told the other two, that he believed, they three could make head against all the learned in Europe: To which the great <HI>Salmasius</HI> fiercely replied, <Q>“Do you and M. <HI>Maussac</HI> join yourselves to all that are learned in the world, and you shall find that I alone am a match for you all.”</Q></P>

<P>VER. 193. <HI>But were there One whose fires</HI> &amp;c.] Our Poet's friendship with Mr. Addison began in the year 1713. It was cultivated, on both sides, with all the marks of mutual esteem and affection, and constant intercourse of good offices. Mr. Addison was always commending moderation, warned his friend against a blind attachment to party, and blamed Steele for his indiscreet zeal. The translation of-the Iliad being now on foot, he recommended it to the public, and joined with the Tories in pushing the subscription; but at the same time advised Mr. Pope not to be content with the applause of one half of the na∣tion. On the other hand, Mr. Pope made his friend's interest his own (see note on ℣ 215, 1 Ep. B. ii. of Hor.) and, when
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
<HI>Dennis</HI> so brutally attacked the Tragedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> he wrote that humourous piece called <HI>A narrative of his madness.</HI></P>
<P>Thus things continued till Mr. Pope's growing reputation, and superior genius in Poetry gave umbrage to his friend's false delicacy: and then it was he encouraged Philips and others (see his Letters) in their clamours against him as a Tory and Jacobite, who had assisted in writing the <HI>Examiners;</HI> and, under an affected care for the Government, would have hid, even from himself, the true grounds of his disgust. But his jealousy soon broke out, and discovered itself, first to Mr. Pope, and, not long after, to all the world. <HI>The Rape of the Lock</HI> had been written in a very hasty manner, and printed in a collection of Miscellanies. The success it met with encouraged the Author to revise and enlarge it, and give it a more important air, which was done by advancing it into a mock-epic Poem. In order to this it was to have its Machinery; which, by the hap∣piest invention, he took from the <HI>Rosyerusian</HI> System. Full of this noble conception, he communicated it to Mr. Addison, who he imagined would have been equally delighted with the improvement. On the contrary, he had the mortification to have his friend receive it coldly; and more, to advise him against any alteration; for that the poem in its original state was a delicious little thing, and, as he expressed it, <HI>merum sal.</HI> Mr. Pope was shocked for his friend; and then first began to open his eyes to his Character.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a translation of the first book of the Iliad appeared under the name of Mr. Tickell; which coming out at a critical juncture, when Mr. Pope was in the midst of his engagements on the same subject, and by a creature of Mr. Addison's, made him suspect this to be another shaft from the same quiver: And after a diligent enquiry, and laying many odd circumstances together, he was fully convinced that it was not only published with Mr. Addison's participation, but was
<PB N="27" REF="30" MS="y"/>
indeed his own performance. Mr. Pope, in his first resent∣ment of this usage, was resolved to expose this new Version in a severe critic upon it. I have now by me the Copy he had marked for this purpose; in which he has classed the several faults in translation, language, and numbers, under their pro∣per heads. But the growing splendor of his own work so eclipsed the faint efforts of this opposition, that he trusted to its own weakness and malignity for the justice due to it. About this time, Mr. Addison's son in law, the E. of Warwick, told Mr. Pope, that it was in vain to think of being well with his Father who was naturally a jealous man; that Mr. Pope's su∣perior talents in poetry had hurt him, and to such a degree, that he had underhand encouraged <HI>Gildon</HI> to write a thing about Wycherley, in which he had scurrilously abused Mr. Pope and his family; and for this service he had given Gildon ten gui∣neas, after the pamphlet was printed. The very next day Mr. Pope, in a great heat, wrote Mr. Addison a Letter, where∣in he told him, he was no stranger to his behaviour; which, however, he should not imitate: But that what he thought faul∣ty in him, he would tell him fairly to his face; and what de∣served praise he would not deny him to the world: and, as a proof of this disposition towards him, he had sent him the in∣closed, which was the <HI>Character,</HI> first published separately, and afterwards inserted in this place of the Epist. to Dr. Arbuth∣not. This plain dealing had no ill effect. Mr. Addison treat∣ed Mr. Pope with civility, and, as Mr. Pope believed, with justice, from this time to his death, which happened about three years after.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>But were there one whose fires,</HI> &amp;c.] The strokes in this Character are highly finished. Atterbury so well understood the force of them, that in one of his letters to Mr. Pope he says, <Q>“Since you now know where your strength lies, I hope you will not suffer that talent to lie unemployed.”</Q> He did not; and, by that means, brought satiric Poetry to its perfection.</P>

He replied, that I thought too highly of the public taste; that, most commonly, it was formed on that of half a dozen people in fashion, who took the lead, and who sometimes have obtrud∣ed on the Town the dullest performances, for works of Wit: while, at the same time, some true effort of genius, without name or recommendation, hath passed by the public eye unob∣served or neglected: That he once before made the trial I now objected to, with success, in the <HI>Essay on Man:</HI> which was at first given (as he told me) to Dr. Younge, to Dr. Desaguliers, to Lord Bolingbroke, to Lord Pagett, and, in short, to every body but to him who was capable of writing it. However, to make him amends, this same Public, when let into the secret, would, for some time after, suffer no poem, with a moral title, to pass for any one's but his. So the <HI>Essay on human Life,</HI> the <HI>Essay on Reason,</HI> and many others of a worse tendency, were very liberally bestowed upon him.</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occasion of publishing these <HI>Imitations</HI> was the Clamour rais'd on some of my <HI>Epistles.</HI> An Answer from <HI>Horace</HI> was both more full, and of more Dignity, than any I could have made in my own person; and the Example of much greater Freedom in so eminent a Divine as Dr. <HI>Donne,</HI> seem'd a proof with what indignation and contempt a Christian may treat Vice or Folly, in ever so low, or ever so high a Sta∣tion. Both these Authors were acceptable to the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> under whom they lived. The Satires of Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> I versifyed, at the desire of the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> while he was Lord Treasurer, and of the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> who had been Secretary of State; neither of whom look'd upon a Satire on Vi∣cious Courts as any Reflection on those they serv'd in. And indeed there is not in the world a greater er∣ror, than that which Fools are so apt to fall into, and Knaves with good reason to encourage, the mistaking a <HI>Satirist</HI> for a <HI>Libeller;</HI> whereas to a <HI>true Satirist</HI> no∣thing is so odious as a <HI>Libeller,</HI> for the same reason as to a man <HI>truly virtuous</HI> nothing is so hateful as a <HI>Hy∣pocrite.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE First Satire of the Second Book OF HORACE IMITATED.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER expects a <HI>Paraphrase</HI> of Horace, or a faithful Copy of his genius, or manner of writing, in these IMITATIONS, will be much disappointed. Our Author uses the Roman Poet for little more than his canvas: And if the old design or colouring chance to suit his purpose, it is well: if not, he employs his own, without scruple or ceremony. Hence it is, he is so frequently serious where Horace is in jest; and at ease where Horace is disturbed. In a word, he regulates his movements no further on his Original, than was necessary for his concurrence, in pro∣moting their common plan of <HI>Reformation of manners.</HI></P>
<P>Had it been his purpose merely to paraphrase an ancient Sati∣rist he had hardly made choice of Horace; with whom, as a Poet, he held little in common, besides a comprehensive know∣ledge of life and manners, and a certain <HI>curious felicity</HI> of ex∣pression, which consists in using the simplest language with dig∣nity, and the most ornamented, with ease. For the rest, his harmony and strength of numbers, his force and splendor of colouring, his gravity and sublime of sentiment, would have ra∣ther led him to another model. Nor was his temper less unlike that of Horace, than his talents. What Horace would only smile at, Mr. Pope would treat with the grave severity of Per∣sius: And what Mr. Pope would strike with the caustic light∣ening of Juvenal, Horace would content himself in turning into ridicule.</P>
<P>If it be asked then, why he took any body at all to <HI>imitate,</HI> he has informed us in his <HI>Advertisement.</HI> To which we may add, that this sort of Imitations, which are of the nature of <HI>Parodies,</HI> add reflected grace and splendor on original wit. Be∣sides, he deem'd it more modest to give the name of Imitations to his Satires, than, like Despreaux, to give the name of Sa∣tires to Imitations.</P>

<P>VER. 3. <HI>Scarce to wise</HI> Peter—Chartres] It has been com∣monly observed of the English, that a Rogue never goes to the Gallows without the pity of the Spectators, and their parting curses on the rigour of the Laws that brought him thither: and this has been as commonly ascribed to the <HI>good nature</HI> of the people. But it is a mistake. The true cause is their hatred and envy of power. Their compassion for Dunces and Scoun∣drels (when exposed by great writers to public contempt, either in justice to the age, or in vindication of their own Characters) has the same source. They cover their envy to a superior ge∣nius, in lamenting the severity of his Pen.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 7. <HI>Tim'rous by nature, of the Rich in awe,]</HI> The delicacy of this does not so much lie in the ironical application of it to himself, as in its seriously characterising the Person for whose advice he applies.</P>
<P>VER. 12. <HI>Not write?</HI> &amp;c.] He has omitted the most hu∣mourous part of the answer,
<Q><L>Peream male, si non</L>
<L>Optimum erat,</L></Q>
and has lost the grace, by not imitating the conciseness, of <HI>verum nequeo dormire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55"/>
For conciseness, when it is clear (as in this place) gives the highest grace to elegance of expression.—But what follows is as much above the Original, as this falls short of it.</P>
<P>VER. 20. <HI>Hartshorn]</HI> This was intended as a pleasantry on the novelty of the prescription.</P>
<P>VER. 23. <HI>What? like Sir Richard,</HI> &amp;c.] Mr. Molyneux, a great Mathematician and Philosopher, had a high opinion of Sir Richard Blackmore's poetic vein. <HI>All our English poets, ex∣cept Milton</HI> (says he, in a letter to Mr. Locke) <HI>have been mere</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
<HI>ballad-makers in comparison of him.</HI> And Mr. Locke, in answer to this observation, replies, <HI>I find, with pleasure, a strange har∣mony throughout, between your Thoughts and mine.</HI> Just so a Roman Lawyer, and a Greek Historian, thought of the poetry of Cicero. But these being judgments made by men out of their own profession, are little regarded. And Pope and Juvenal will make Blackmore and Tully pass for Poetasters to the world's end.</P>
<P>VER. 28. <HI>falling Horse?]</HI> The horse on which his Majesty
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
charged at the battle of Oudenard; when the Pretender, and the Princes of the blood of France, fled before him.</P>
<P>VER. 39. <HI>Abuse the City's</HI> best good men <HI>in</HI> metre,] The <HI>best good Man,</HI> a City phrase for the <HI>richest. Metre</HI>—not used here, purely to help the verse, but to shew what it is a Citizen esteems the greatest aggravation of the offence.</P>
<P><HI>VER. 41.</HI> What should ail them?] <HI>Horace hints at</HI> one <HI>rea∣son,</HI> that each fears his own turn may be next; <HI>his imitator gives</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
<HI>another,</HI> and with more art, a reason which insinuates, that his very lenity, in using feigned names, increases the number of his Enemies.</P>
<P>VER. 46. <HI>Darty his Ham-pye;]</HI> This Lover of Ham-pye own'd the fidelity of the poet's pencil; and said, he had done justice to his taste; but that if, instead of <HI>Ham-pye,</HI> he had given him <HI>Sweet-pye,</HI> he never could have pardoned him.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>
VER. 50. <HI>Like in all else, as one Egg to another.]</HI> This has neither the justness nor elegance of
<Q><L>ovo prognatus eodem.</L></Q>
For tho' it may appear odd, that those <HI>who come from the same Egg</HI> should have tempers and pursuits directly contrary; yet there is nothing strange, that two Brothers, <HI>alike in all things else,</HI> should have different amusements.</P>
<P>VER. 52. <HI>As downright Shippen, or as old Montagne:]</HI> They had this, indeed, in common, to use great liberties of speech, and to profess saying what they thought. Montagne had <HI>many</HI> qualities, that have gained him the love and esteem of his Rea∣ders: The other had <HI>one,</HI> which always gain'd him the favour∣able
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
attention of his Hearers. For, as a celebrated Roman Ora∣tor observes, <Q>“Maledicit INERUDITUS apertius et saepius, cum periculo etiam suo. Affert et ista res OPINIONEM, quia li∣bentissime homines audiunt ea quae dicere <HI>ipsi</HI> noluissent.”</Q></P>
<P>VER. 56. <HI>the medium must be clear.]</HI> Allusion to a fountain of limpid water, thro' which the contents of the bottom are dis∣covered. This thought, tho' not very exact, assisted him in the easy and happy change of the metaphor in the following line.</P>
<P><HI>VER. 63.</HI> My head and heart thus flowing from my quilt,] <HI>In∣ferior to the Original:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
<L>Ille velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim</L>

<P>Persius alluded to this idea, when he said,</P>
<Q><L>Vidi, vidi ipse, Libelle! etc.</L></Q>
<P>VER. 64. <HI>Verse-man or Prose-man, term me which you will, Pa∣pist or Protestant, etc.]</HI> The original thought (which is very flat, and so ill and aukwardly expressed, as to be taken for a monkish Addition) is here admirably imitated, in a lively cha∣racter of himself, and his Writings.</P>
<P>VER. 69. <HI>Satire's my Weapon]</HI> In these Words, our Author has happily explained the true Character of Horace's ironical Apology, which is to this purpose: Nature, says he, has given all Creatures the means of <HI>offence</HI> and <HI>defence:</HI> The wolf has teeth, the bull has horns, and my weapon is satire. And, at the same time that he vindicates the claim to his <HI>natural</HI> talent, he shews the moral use of it, by the instances of the like na∣tural talents of Cervius to <HI>inform,</HI> of Canidia to <HI>poison,</HI> and of Turius to <HI>pass sentence.</HI> The turn of this ludicrous argumenta∣tion is fine and delicate; and we find his Imitator saw the whole force of it.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
VER. 71. <HI>I only wear it in a land of Hectors, etc.]</HI> Superior to, <HI>tutus ab infestis latronibus,</HI> which only carries on the metaphor in <HI>ensis Vagina tectus,</HI> whereas the imitation does more; for, along with the metaphor, it conveys the image of the subject, by presenting the reader with the several objects of satire.</P>
<P>VER. 72. <HI>Thieves, Supercargoes,]</HI> The names, at that time, usually bestowed on those whom the trading Companies sent with their Ships, and intrusted with their concerns, abroad.</P>
<P>VER. 73. <HI>Save but our Army! etc.]</HI> "Une Maladie nouvelle (says the admirable Author <HI>de L'esprit des Loix)</HI> <Q>“s'est répan∣due en Europe; elle a saisi nos Princes, et leur fait entretenir un nombre desordonné de Troupes. Elle a ses redoublemens, et elle devient <HI>necessairement contagieuse.</HI> Car si-tot qu'un Etat augmente ce qu'il appelle ses Troupes, les autres sou∣dain augmentent les leurs, de façon qu'on ne gagne rien par∣là que la Ruïne commune. Chaque Monarque tient sur pied toutes les Armées qu'il pourroit avoir, si ses Peuples étoient en danger d'étre exterminés; et <HI>on nomme Paix cet état d'effort de tous contre tous.</HI> Aussi l'Europe est-elle si ruïnée, que les particuliers, qui seroient dans la situation où sont les trois

<P>VER. 81. <HI>Slander or Poison dread from Delia's rage, From furious Sappho</HI>—] Two Ladies, who thought themselves ag∣grieved in these characters, had this satisfaction proposed by Lord Peterborough, To transpose the circumstances, and give the poi∣soning part to <HI>Sappho,</HI> and the other favour to <HI>Delia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66" MS="y"/>
VER. 81—84. <HI>Slander—libell'd by her hate.]</HI> There seems to be more spirit here than in the original. But it is hard to pro∣nounce with certainty. For tho' one may be confident there is more force in the 83d and 84th lines than in
<Q><L>Canidia Albuti, quibus est inimica, venenum;</L></Q>
yet there might be something, for ought we know, in the Cha∣racter or History of <HI>Cervius</HI> which might bring up that line to the spirit of poinancy of the 82d verse of the Imitation.</P>
<P>VER. 85.—90. <HI>It's proper power to hurt, etc.]</HI> All, ex∣cept the two last lines, inferior to the elegance and precision of the Original.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="67"/>
VER. 93,—96. <HI>Whether old age—shade]</HI> The Original is more finished, and even sublime. Besides, the last verse—<HI>To wrap me in the universal shade,</HI> has a languor and redundancy unusual with our author.</P>
<P>VER. 97. <HI>Whether the darken'd room—Or whiten'd wall—]</HI> This is only a wanton joke upon the terms of his Original</P>
<Q><L>Quisquis erit vitae color.</L></Q>
<P>VER. 99. <HI>In durance, exile, Bedlam, or the Mint,]</HI> The Poet, in our equal Government, might talk of the disasters incident to wit, at his ease, and with all this levity of style. But it was a serious matter with Horace; and is so still with our witty Neigh∣bours; one of whom has well expressed their condition, in the following lines,</P>
<Q><L>Eh! Que sait-on? Un simple badinage,</L>
<L>Mal entendu d'un Prude, ou d'un Sot,</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="65" REF="68"/>
<L>Peut vous jetter sur un autre rivage:</L>
<L>Pour perdre un Sage, il ne faut qu'un Bigot.</L></Q>
<P>VER. 104. <HI>Will club their Testers,</HI> &amp;c.] The image is ex∣ceeding humourous, and at the same time betrays the injustice of their resentment in the very circumstance of their indulging it; as it shews the Poet had said no more of their avarice, than what was true. Our Author's abundance of Wit has made his readers backward in acknowledging his Humour. But the veins are equally rich; and the one flows with ease, and the other is always placed with propriety.</P>
<P>VER. 105.—120. <HI>What? arm'd for Virtue, etc.]</HI> This is not only superior to any thing in Horace, but equal to any thing in himself.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69"/>
VER. 110. <HI>Lights of the Church, or Guardians of the Laws?]</HI> Because just <HI>Satire</HI> is an useful supplement to the sanctions of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Religion;</HI> and has, therefore, a claim to the protec∣tion of those who preside in the administration of both.</P>
<P>VER. 111. <HI>Could Boileau—Could Dryden]</HI> I believe neither of them would have been suffered to do this, had they not been egregious flatterers of the several Courts to which they be∣longed.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Could pension'd Boileau—Could Laureate Dryden]</HI> It was Horace's purpose to compliment the former times, and therefore he gives the virtuous examples of Scipio and Laelius; it was Mr. Pope's, to satirize the present, and therefore he gives the vicious examples of Louis, Charles, and James. Either way the instances are equally pertinent; but in the latter they have ra∣ther greater force. Only the line,
<Q><L>Uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis,</L></Q>
loses something of its spirit in the imitation; for the <HI>amici,</HI> re∣ferred to, were Scipio and Laelius.</P>
<P>VER. 116. <HI>Unplac'd, unpension'd, no man's heir, or slave?]</HI> Mr. Pope, it is well known, made his fortune by his Homers. Lord
<PB N="67" REF="70" MS="y"/>
Treasurer Oxford affected to discourage that design; for so great a Genius (he said) ought not to be confined to Translation. He always used Mr. Pope civilly; and would often express his con∣cern that his religion rendered him incapable of a <HI>place.</HI> At the same time, he never spoke one word of a <HI>pension.</HI> For this of∣fer he was solely indebted to the Whig-Ministers. In the begin∣ning of George I. lord Hallifax, of his own motion, sent for Mr. Pope, and told him, it had often given him concern that so great a Poet had never been distinguished; that he was glad it was now in his power to serve him; and, if he cared to accept it, he should have a pension not clogged with any engagements. Mr. Pope thanked him, and desired time to consider of it. After three months (having heard nothing further from that Lord) he wrote him a letter to repeat his thanks; in which he took oc∣casion to mention the affair of the <HI>pension</HI> with much indifference. So the thing dropt till Mr. Craggs came into the Ministry. The affair of the <HI>pension</HI> was then resumed. And this minister, in a very frank and friendly manner, told Mr. Pope, that three hun∣dred pounds a year was then at his service: that he had the ma∣nagement
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
of the secret-service money, and could pay him such a pension, without its being known, or ever coming to account. But now Mr. Pope declined the offer without hesitation: only, in return for so friendly a proposal, he told the Secretary, that if at any time he wanted money he would draw upon him for 100 or 200 l. which liberty, notwithstanding, he never took. Mr. Craggs more than once pressed him on this head; and urged the conveniency of a Chariot; which Mr. Pope was sen∣sible enough of: But the precariousness of that supply made him very prudently decline the thoughts of an equipage, which it was much better never to set up, than not properly to sup∣port.</P>

Les Magistrats y sont de petits souverains, qui ne sont pas assez grands pour mepriser les injures.

<Q><L>Esto, siquis <HI>mala;</HI> sed <HI>bona</HI> si quis.</L></Q>
But the Imitator's <HI>grave Epistles</HI> shew the <HI>satire</HI> to be a se∣rious reproof, and therefore justifiable; which the <HI>integer ipse</HI> of the Original does not: for however this might plead in mi∣tigation of the offence, nothing but their being <HI>grave Epistles</HI> could justify the attack.</P>

<P>Some Critics tell us, it is want of taste to put this line in the mouth of Trebatius. But our Poet confutes this censure, by shewing how well the sense of it agrees to his Friend's charac∣ter. The Lawyer is cautious and fearful; but as soon as SIR ROBERT, the Patron both of Law and Gospel, is mentioned
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
as approving them, he changes his note, and, in the lan∣guage of old Plouden, owns, <HI>the Case is altered.</HI> Now was it not as natural, when Horace had given a hint that Augustus himself supported him, for Trebatius, a Court Advocate, who had been long a Client to him and his Uncle, to confess <HI>the Case was altered?</HI></P>

<P>VER. 9. BETHEL.] The same to whom several of Mr. Pope's Letters are addressed.</P>

<P>VER. 26. <HI>a whole Hog barbecu'd!]</HI> The Poet has here given a beauty equivalent to that in the Original,
<Q><L>Porrectum magno magnum spectare catino,</L></Q>
which, by the slowness of the Syllables, where four spondees fol∣low one another, well expresses the enormous bulk of the fish which the Glutton pray'd for.</P>

<P><PB N="83" REF="85"/>
VER. 50. <HI>For him you'll call a dog, and her a bitch]</HI> One cannot but admire the lively turn here given to the Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
VER. 80. <HI>The Soul subsides, and wickedly inclines To seem but mortal ev'n in sound Divines.]</HI> Horace was an Epicurean, and laughed at the immortality of the soul. He therefore describes that languor of the mind proceeding from intemperance, on the idea, and in the Terms of Plato,
<Q><L>affigit humo divinae particulam aurae.</L></Q>
To <HI>this</HI> his ridicule is pointed. Our Poet, with more sobriety
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
and judgment, has turned the ridicule, from the Doctrine, which he believed, upon those Preachers of it, whose feasts and compotations in Taverns did not edify him: and so has added surprizing humour and spirit to the easy elegance of the Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>VER. 82. <HI>On morning wings etc.]</HI> Much happier and nobler than the original.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>
VER. 87. <HI>Or tir'd in search of Truth, or search of Rhyme.]</HI> A fine ridicule on the extravagance of human pursuits; where the
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
most trifling and most important concerns of life succeed one another, indifferently.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
VER. 123. <HI>Oh Impudence of wealth! with all thy store, How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor?]</HI>
<Q><L>Cur eget indignus quisquam, te divite?</L></Q>
is here admirably paraphrased. And it is observable in these <HI>Imitations,</HI> that where our Poet keeps to the sentiments of Ho∣race, he rather piques himself in excelling the most finished touches of his Original, than in correcting or improving the more inferior parts. Of this uncommon excellence all his Writ∣ings bear such marks, that it gave countenance to an invidious imputation, as if his chief talent lay in copying finely. But if ever there was an inventive genius in Poetry it was Pope's. But his fancy was so corrected by his judgment and his imitation so
<PB N="89" REF="91" MS="y"/>
spirited by his genius, that what he <HI>improved</HI> struck the vulgar eye more strongly than what he <HI>invented.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 128. <HI>As M**o's was, etc.]</HI> I think this light stroke of satire ill placed; and hurts the dignity of the preceding mo∣rality. Horace was very serious, and properly so, when he said,
<Q><L>cur, Improbe! carae</L>
<L>Non aliquid patriae tanto emetiris acervo.</L></Q>
He remembered, and hints with just indignation, at those luxu∣rious Patricians of his old party; who, when they had agreed to establish a fund in the cause of Freedom, under the conduct of Brutus, could never be persuaded to withdraw from their expen∣sive pleasures what was sufficient for the support of so great a
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
cause. He had prepared his apology for this liberty, in the pre∣ceding line, where he pays a fine compliment to Augustus:
<Q><L>quare</L>
<L>Templa ruunt antiqua Deûm?</L></Q>
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
which oblique Panegyric the Imitator has very properly turned into a just stroke of satire.</P>
<P>VER. 139. <HI>In South-sea days not happier, etc.]</HI> Mr. Pope had South-sea stock, which he did not sell out. It was valued at be∣tween twenty and thirty thousand pounds when it fell.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
VER. 156. <HI>And, what's more rare, a Poet shall say Grace.]</HI> The pleasantry of this line consists in the supposed rarity of a Poet's having a table of his own; or a sense of gratitude for the bles∣sings
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
he receives. But it contains, too, a sober reproof of Peo∣ple of Condition, for their unmanly and brutal disuse of so na∣tural a duty.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96" MS="y"/>
VER. 171. <HI>Well, if the use be mine, etc.]</HI> In a letter to this Mr. Bethel, of March 20, 1743, he says, <Q>“My Landlady, Mrs. <HI>Vernon,</HI> being dead, this Garden and House are offered me in sale; and, I believe (together with the cottages on each side my grass-plot next the Thames) will come at about a thousand pounds. If I thought any very particular friend would be pleased to live in it after my death (for, as it is, it serves all my purposes as well during life) I would purchase it; and more particularly could I hope two things, That
<PB N="95" REF="97" MS="y"/>
the Friend who should like it, was so much younger and heal∣their than myself, as to have a prospect of its continuing his some years longer than I can of its continuing mine. But most of those I love are travelling out of the world, not into it; and unless I have such a view given me, I have no va∣nity nor pleasure that does not stop short of the Grave.”</Q>—So that we see, what some of his Friends would not believe, his thoughts in prose and verse were the same.</P>
<P><HI>VER. 175.</HI> Or, in a jointure, vanish from the heir;] <HI>The ex∣pression</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
pression well describes the surprize an heir must be in, to find himself excluded by that Instrument which was made to secure his succession. For Butler humourously defines a <HI>Jointure</HI> to be the act whereby Parents</P>
<Q><L>turn</L>
<L>Their Childrens Tenants, e're they're born.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99"/>
VER. 183. <HI>proud Buckingham's etc.]</HI> Villers Duke of Buck∣ingham. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 185. <HI>Let lands and houses etc.]</HI> The turn of his imi∣tation, in the concluding part, obliged him to diversify the sen∣timent. They are equally noble: but Horace's is expressed with the greater force.</P>

VER. 16. <HI>You limp, like Blackmore on a Lord Mayor's horse.]</HI> The fame of this heavy Poet, however problematical elsewhere, was universally received in the City of London. His versifica∣tion is here exactly described: stiff, and not strong; stately and yet dull, like the sober and slow-paced Animal generally em∣ployed to mount the Lord Mayor: and therefore here humour∣ously opposed to Pegasus. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 26. <HI>And house with</HI> Montagne <HI>now, and now with</HI> Locke,] <HI>i. e.</HI> Chuse either an <HI>active</HI> or a <HI>contemplative</HI> life, as is
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
most fitted to the season and circumstances.—For he regarded these Writers as the best Schools to form a man for the world; or to give him a knowledge of himself: <HI>Montagne</HI> excelling in his observations on social and civil life; and <HI>Locke,</HI> in dive∣loping the faculties, and explaining the operations of the human mind.</P>
<P>VER. 30. <HI>Still true to Virtue—with Aristippus, or St. Paul,]</HI> It was the Poet's purpose in this place, to give us the picture of his own mind; not that of Horace's, who tells us, he some∣times went with <HI>Zeno,</HI> and sometimes with <HI>Aristippus;</HI> the
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
extremes of whose different systems Tully thus justly censures: <Q>“Ut quoniam <HI>Aristippus,</HI> quasi animum nullum habeamus, cor∣pus solum tuetur; <HI>Zeno,</HI> quasi corporis simus expertes, ani∣mum solum complectitur.”</Q> But neither truth nor decency would suffer our Poet to say, that, to suit himself to the times, he went into either of these follies. To shew us, therefore, he took no more from the Stoics than their sincerity and warmth for the interests of Virtue, he compares himself to a friend, in whom he observed that warmth. And by joining St. <HI>Paul</HI> with <HI>Aristippus</HI> he would insinuate, that he took no more from the Cyrenaic sect than a charitable compliance to occasions, for the benefit of his neighbour. Thus in serving himself of his friend to temper the rigidity of one sect of philosophy, while the Apo∣stle is employed to rectify the looseness of the other, he brings Mr. <HI>Lyttelton</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> acquainted; for those who correct opposite extremes must needs meet; and so we see the <HI>Patriot</HI>

<P>VER. 32. <HI>Indulge my candor—Back to my native Moderation slide]</HI> An honest and useful insinuation, that, tho' Parties in the State prosecute their ends on never so true principles, and with never so good intentions, yet opposition is apt to make the most scrupulous Leaders of them sometimes violate both <HI>candor</HI> and <HI>moderation.</HI> However, by the expression, of <HI>indulging his candor,</HI> he would insinuate too, that, when he allowed the least to it, he never violated Truth; and, by <HI>sliding back to his na∣tive moderation,</HI> that he always kept within the bounds of Rea∣son.—But the general Sense of the whole passage is, that when he went with the Stoics, who advise a <HI>public</HI> life, the character of his <HI>civil</HI> virtue was <HI>rigid;</HI> when he went with the Cyrenaics, who encourage a <HI>private,</HI> that of his <HI>social</HI> was <HI>indulgent.</HI></P>

Speaking of his obligations to this great Physician and others of the Fa∣culty, in a Letter to Mr. Allen, about a month before his death, he says, <Q>“There is no end of my kind treatment from the Faculty.

But what follows,

<P><PB N="109" REF="110"/>
VER. 77. <HI>Here Wisdom calls: etc.]</HI> All from hence to ℣ 110, is a pretty close translation: but in general done with so mas∣terly a spirit, that the Original, tho' one of the most finished passages in Horace, looks only like the <HI>imitation</HI> of it.</P>
<P>VER. 78. <HI>As Gold to Silver, Virtue is to Gold.]</HI> This perhaps is the most faulty line in the whole collection. The Original is,
<Q><L>Vilius est auro argentum, virtutibus aurum.</L></Q>
which only says, <HI>that as Silver is of less value than Gold, so Gold</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
<HI>is of less value than Virtue:</HI> in which <HI>simple inferiority,</HI> and not the <HI>proportion</HI> of it, is implied. For it was as contrary to the Author's purpose, as it is to common sense, to suppose, that Virtue was but just as much better than gold, as gold is better than silver. Yet Mr. Pope, too attentive to his constant object, <HI>conciseness,</HI> has, before he was aware, fallen into this meaning. However this, and many other inaccuracies in his works, had been corrected had he lived; as many, that now first appear in this Edition, were actually corrected a little before his death.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but do justice to one of his many good qualities, a very rare one indeed, and what none but a truly great genius can attend to indulge; I mean his extreme readi∣ness, and unfeigned pleasure, in acknowledging his mistakes: this, with an impatience to reform them, he possessed in a greater degree, and with less affectation than any Man I ever knew.</P>

Dacier laughs at an able Critic, who was scandalized, that the antient Scholiasts had not explained what Horace meant by <HI>a wall of brass;</HI> for, says Dacier, <Q>“Chacun se fait des difficultes

Our Poet has hap∣pily served himself of this impertinence to convey a very fine stroke of satire.</P>
<P>VER. 97. <HI>And say, etc.]</HI> These four lines greatly superior to any thing in the Original.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115"/>
VER. 117. <HI>Full many a Beast goes in,]</HI> This expression is used for the joke's sake; but it hurts his <HI>moral;</HI> which is, that <HI>they come out beasts.</HI> He should here have stuck to the terms of his Original, <HI>vestigia omnia te adversum spectantia.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 118. <HI>Adieu to Virtue, etc.]</HI> These two lines are intend∣ed for the application or moral of a fable, which needs no ex∣plaining; and, consequently, they impair the <HI>grace</HI> of it, which at best is inferior to his Original. For Horace speaks of the common people, <HI>Populus Romanus,</HI> to whom one of Aesop's Fables was properly addressed: too simple a method of convey∣ing truth to <HI>the well-drest Rabble of St. James's.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116"/>
VER. 124. <HI>Alike in nothing but one Lust of Gold, Just half the land would buy, and half be sold:]</HI> Here the argument suffers a little for the sake of the satire. The reason why the People should not be followed is because
<Q><L>Bellua multorum est capitum. nam quid sequar, aut quem?</L></Q>
they are so divers in their pursuits (says Horace) that one can∣not follow this man without being condemned by that. The imitator says, they all go on one common principle, <HI>the lust of gold.</HI> This inaccuracy, tho' Horace has a little of it, yet he has however artfully disguised it, by speaking of the various ob∣jects
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
of this one Passion, <HI>avarice,</HI> as of so many various passions,
<Q><L>Pars hominum gestit conducere publica: sunt qui, etc.</L>
<L>Crustis et pomis</L>
<L>Multis occulto, etc.</L></Q>
but his imitator has unwarily drawn them to a point, by the in∣troductory addition of the two lines above,
<Q><L>Alike in nothing, etc.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 126. <HI>Their Country's wealth our mightier Misers drain,]</HI> The undertakers for advancing Loans to the Public on the Funds.
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
They have been commonly accused of making it a job. But in so corrupt times, the fault is not always to be imputed to a Ministry: it having been found, on trial, that the wisest and most virtuous citizen of this or any other age, with every re∣quisite knowledge in such matters, and supported by all the weight an honest Administration could afford him, was, they say, unable to abolish this inveterate mystery of iniquity.</P>

<Q><L>decedentia certis</L>
<L>Tempora momentis</L></Q>
by which Horace means no more than <HI>the change of seasons.</HI> But as this change is here considered as an object of admiration, his imitator has judiciously expressed it in the▪ more sublime figu∣rative terms of
<Q><L>Stars that rise and fall,</L></Q>
by whose courses the seasons are marked and distinguished.</P>
<P>VER. 8. <HI>trust the Ruler with the skies, To him commit the hour,]</HI> Our Author, in these imitations, has been all along care∣ful to correct the loose morals, and absurd divinity of his Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>VER. 10. <HI>And view this dreadful All without a fear.]</HI> He has added this idea to his text; and it greatly heightens the dignity of
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
the whole thought. He gives it the appellation of a <HI>dreadful All,</HI> because the immensity of God's creation, which modern philosophy has so infinitely enlarged, is apt to affect <HI>narrow</HI> minds, who measure the divine comprehension by their own, with dreadful suspicions of man's being overlooked in this dark and narrower corner of existence, by a Governor occupied and bu∣sled with the sum of things.</P>
<P>VER. 21. <HI>In either case, believe me, we admire;] i. e.</HI> These objects, in either case, affect us, as objects unknown affect the mind, and consequently betray us into false judgments.</P>

The <HI>curse</HI> is the <HI>same</HI> (says he) <HI>whe∣ther we joy or grieve.</HI> Why so? Because, in either case, the man is <HI>surprized,</HI> hurried off, and led away captive.
<Q><L>(The good or bad to one extreme betray</L>

<P>VER. 29. <HI>reflected Plate]</HI> This epithet conveys a fine stroke of satire; it insinuates, that the enamoured possessor, half ashamed of his passion, obliquely eyes his plate from the <HI>reflect∣ing</HI> mirror, that hangs opposite to his Side-board; which idea he expresses in another place by</P>

Not to cure you of that bane of life, <HI>admiration,</HI> but to raise and inflame it, by <HI>doubling your surprize.</HI> And this a <HI>false taste</HI> will always do; as a <HI>pre∣tended taste</HI> will always affect to do; there being none so given to raptures as the <HI>Virtuoso-Tribe:</HI> whereas the <HI>Man of true taste</HI> finds but few things to approve; and those he approves with moderation.</P>

<Q><L>In this impartial glass, my Muse intends</L>

<Q><L>Laugh at your <HI>Friends,</HI> and if your <HI>Friends</HI> be sore,</L>

because their impatience under reproof would shew, they had a great deal which wanted to be set right.</P>
<P>On this principle, <HI>Swift</HI> falls under his correction. He could not bear to see a Friend he so much valued, live in the miserable abuse of one of Nature's best gifts, unadmonished of his folly. Swift, (as we may see by some posthumous Volumes, lately published, so dishonourable and injurious to his memory) trifled away his old age in a dissipation that women and boys might be ashamed of. For when men have given into a long habit of employing their <HI>wit</HI> only to shew their parts, to edge their spleen, to pan∣der to a faction; or, in short, to any thing but that for which Nature bestowed it, namely, to recommend, and set off Truth;
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
old age, which abates the passions, will never rectify the abuses they occasioned. But the remains of wit, instead of seeking and recovering its proper channel, will run into that miserable depravity of taste here condemned: and in which Dr. Swift seems to have placed no inconsiderable part of his wisdom. <HI>I chuse</HI> (says he, in a Letter to Mr. Pope) <HI>my Companions amongst those of the least consequence, and most compliance: I read the most trifling Books I can find: and whenever I write, it is upon the most trifling subjects.</HI> And again, <Q>“I love <HI>La Bagatelle</HI> bet∣ter than ever.

<P>THE Reflections of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the Judgments past in his Epistle to <HI>Augustus,</HI> seem'd so season∣able to the present Times, that I could not help apply∣ing them to the use of my own Country.

VER. 69. <HI>Shakespear.]</HI> Shak spear and Ben Johnson may truly be said not much to have thought of this Immortality, the one in many pieces composed in haste for the Stage: the other in his latter works in general, which <HI>Dryden</HI> call'd his <HI>Dotages.</HI> P. Ibid. <HI>Shakespear—For gain, not glory, etc.]</HI> SHAKESPEAR knew perfectly well what belonged to a true composition, as ap∣pears from <HI>the Tempest,</HI> and <HI>the Merry Wives of Windsor.</HI> But he generally complied with the ignorance, and the ill taste of his Au∣dience. However, in his most irregular plays his wit and sublimity make amends for his transgression of the rules of art, and sup∣port him in it. But, happily for the improvement of the Drama, he had a competitor in JOHNSON; who, with a greater tempta∣tion to comply with the bad taste of the age, yet had not the same force of genius to support an irregular composition. Johnson, therefore, borrowed all he could from art; and like an expe∣rienced general, when he could not depend on his natural strength, never ventured from behind his lines. The consequence was, that Shakespear having once tried to reform the taste [See Hamlet] and, on failing, had complied with it, became the favourite Poet of the People; while Johnson, who, for the reason given
<PB N="153" REF="152"/>
above, could not be so complaisant, was all his life long in a state of war with them. This, and not (as is commonly imagined) the ignorance of one, and the superior knowledge of the other, was the true cause of that difference which we find between these two Capital Writers, in the art and construction of their pieces. So that here, we see, a want of sufficient na∣tural genius accidentally contributed to the refinement of the English stage.</P>

<P>VER. 104. <HI>Bentley]</HI> This excellent critic, who had the for∣tune to be extravagantly despised and ridiculed by two of the greatest wits, and as extravagantly feared and flattered by two of the greatest Scholars of his time, will deserve to have that ju∣stice done him now, which he never met with while alive.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157"/>
He was a great master both of the languages and the learn∣ing of polite Antiquity; whose writings he studied with no other design than to correct the errors of the text. For this he had a strong natural understanding, a great share of penetration, and a sagacity and acumen very uncommon. All which qualities he had greatly improved by long exercise and application. Yet, at the same time, he had so little of that elegance of judgment, we call <HI>Taste,</HI> that he knew nothing of <HI>Style,</HI> as it accommo∣dates itself, and is appropriated to the various kinds of compo∣sition. And the faculties of his Understanding being infinitely better than those of his Imagination, the <HI>style of poetry</HI> was what he had the least idea of. So that, that clearness of concep∣tion, which so much assisted his critical sagacity, in discovering and reforming errors in books of science, where a philosophical precision, and grammatical exactness of language is employed, served but to betray him into absurd and extravagant conjec∣tures when ever he attempted to reform the text of a Poet, whose diction he was always for deducing to the prosaic rules of logi∣cal severity; and whenever he found what a great master of speech calls <HI>verbum ardens,</HI> he was sure not to leave it till he had thoroughly quenched it in his critical standish. But to make philology amends, he was a perfect master of all the mysteries of the ancient <HI>Rythmus.</HI></P>
<P>The most important of his works, as a scholar, is his <HI>Critic on the Epistles of Phalaris:</HI> and the least considerable, his <HI>Remarks on the Discourse concerning Free-thinking.</HI> Yet the first, with all its superiority of Learning, Argument, and Truth, was borne down by the vivacity and clamour of a Party, which carried the Public along with them: while the other, employed only in the easy and trifling task of exposing a very dull and very ignorant Rhapsodist, was as extravagantly extolled. For it was his odd fortune (as our Poet expresses it) to pass for<Q><L>A Wit with Dunces, and a Dunce with Wits:</L></Q>
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
whereas in truth he was neither one nor the other. The injustice that had been done him in the <HI>first</HI> case, made him always speak, amongst his friends, of the blind partiality of the public in the <HI>latter,</HI> with the contempt it deserved. For however he might sometime mistake his fort, he was never the dupe of the Pub∣lic judgment. Of which a learned Prelate, now living, gave me this instance: He accidentally met Bentley in the days of Phalaris; and after having complimented him on that noble piece of Criticism (the <HI>Answer</HI> to the Oxford writers) he bad him not be discouraged at this run upon him: for tho' they had got the laughers on their side, yet mere wit and raillery could not long hold out against a work of so much merit. To which the other replied, <Q>“Indeed, Dr. S. I am in no pain about the matter. For I hold it as certain, that no man was ever written out of reputation, but by himself.”</Q> What pity, that he should live to verify his own maxim!</P>

<P>VER. 108. <HI>The Mob of Gentlemen who wrote with Ease;]</HI> The Poet has here very happily exemplified this envied quality of <HI>easy writing</HI> in the turn of the verses that expose it. These wits formed themselves, for the most part, on <HI>Suckling,</HI> a fine and original genius. But on so slippery a ground it was no won∣der such Imitators should fall; and either sink his free and easy manner into insipidity, or abuse it to ribaldry and licentiousness: they did both; till easy writing came to be defined a negligence of <HI>what</HI> they said, and <HI>how</HI> they said it. This was called writ∣ing like a <HI>Gentleman.</HI> But as fashions take their turn, Lord Shaftesbury has introduced a new sort of <HI>Gentleman-like writing,</HI> which consists indeed, like the other, in a negligence of what is said, but joined to much affectation in the manner of saying it.</P>

<P>VER. 121. <HI>One Tragic sentence if I dare deride,]</HI> When wri∣ters of our Author's rank have once effectually exposed <HI>turgid expression,</HI> and reduced it to its just value, which, hitherto, the small critics had mistaken for the <HI>sublime,</HI> these latter are now apt to suspect all they do not understand, to be bombast: like the Idiot in Cervantes, who having been beat for not distinguish∣ing between a Cur and a Greyhound, imagined every dog he
<PB N="162" REF="161"/>
met, to be a Cur-dog. So our respectable Laureat will needs imitate his betters, and <HI>dare to deride</HI> too with the best. <Q>“In what raptures (says he) have I seen an audience, at the fu∣rious sustian and turgid rants of Nat. Lee's <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> Let me give you a sample. Alexander, in a full croud of courtiers, says,
<LG>
<L>When Glory, like the dazzling <HI>Eagle,</HI> stood</L>
<L>Perch'd on my Beaver in the Granic flood;</L>
<L>When <HI>Fortune's</HI> self my standard trembling bore,</L>
<L>And the pale <HI>Fates</HI> stood frighted on the shore;</L>
<L><HI>When the</HI> Immortals on the billows rode,</L>
<L>And I myself appear'd the leading God.</L>
</LG>
If this passage has merit, let us see what figure it would make upon canvas; what sort of picture would arise from it. If Le Brun had seen this lofty description, what one image could he have possibly taken from it? In what colours could he have shewn us <HI>Glory perch'd upon a beaver?</HI> How could he have drawn Fortune trembling? Or indeed what use could he have made of <HI>pale Fates,</HI> or <HI>Immortals riding upon billows,</HI> with this blustering God of his own making at the head of them?”</Q> <HI>Apol. for his life,</HI> p. 88. Ed. oct.—If the <HI>Audience were in raptures</HI> I admire their good taste: for, I think, these six lines are as truly sublime as any thing we have in the Eng∣lish Language. But the Critic is for having the images they convey painted. And, it must be owned, this is no ill test of distinguishing <HI>sound</HI> from <HI>substance.</HI> He is indeed a little mis∣taken in his Painter, as the Connoisseurs will tell him. For this subject demands the genius of Rubens rather than Le Brun. And, from such a one, he might have a very good picture for his money. He seems not to have reflected that <HI>Fortune</HI> and the
<PB N="163" REF="162"/>
<HI>Fates</HI> tho' imaginary, are yet personified Beings. And <HI>Glory,</HI> here, is something more substantial; for by the line,
<Q><L>When Glory like the dazzling Eagle stood, etc.</L></Q>
is meant that Glory appear'd in the shape of an Eagle on his crest.</P>
<P>The truth is, these six lines, unluckily for the Laureate's criticism, contain not only the most <HI>sublime</HI> but the most <HI>judi∣cious</HI> imagery that poetry could conceive or paint. The <HI>first</HI> line alludes to the tradition of an Eagle's hovering over Alex∣ander's head, at the battle of Arbela, as a presage of Victory; Lee, I suppose, might think himself at liberty to transfer it to the passage of the Granicus; and this the poet has made the ground of his fine imagination, of <HI>Glory</HI> in the shape of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> in the style of Homer, who represents Terror, Affright, and a number of such fantastic Beings, swarming on the crests of his heroes.</P>
<P>The representing <HI>Fortune,</HI> in the <HI>third</HI> line, as his standard∣bearer, is very happy. It is not only in the true spirit of poetry, but it gives us a right idea of the nature of his Asiatic expedi∣tion; and the making her <HI>tremble,</HI> as she displayed it, in the passage of the Granicus, the justest notion of the exceeding rash∣ness of that adventure.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> line greatly heightens all these images, by making the <HI>Fates</HI> themselves (who had destined the Persian empire to de∣struction, and called Alexander out of Greece to execute their
<PB N="164" REF="163"/>
decrees) as half afraid that this desperate Madman would frustrate their purpose.</P>
<P>But the sublime of the <HI>two last</HI> verses exceeds all the rest. They are a beautiful allusion to the battle of Scamander in Homer, where Achilles led on the Gods themselves to the destruction of Troy, thro' the billows of that River, which opposed their passage. And the exquisite judgment of the Poet in this allu∣sion is seen by those who have heard that Achilles was Alexan∣der's model of Heroism, and Homer his favourite Historian. Lastly, as to the propriety of Alexander's thus extolling his own actions, the Poet is justified by Q. Curtius, from whom we learn that it was his custom.</P>
<P>From what has been said, we may collect how dangerous it is for a writer to give his opinion out of his own Profession, how well soever he may succeed within it. For this justice is due to the Laureate, that that part of his book, where he has drawn the characters of the set of Players on whom he formed himself, or whom he emulated, and that, with a performance equal to the most perfect of theirs, is indeed (bating the singu∣larity of his phrase) a Master-piece in its kind. So necessary was that ancient direction</P>

<P>VER. 146. <HI>And ev'ry flow'ry Courtier writ Romance.]</HI> The rise and progress of the several branches of literary Science is one of the most curious parts of the history of the human mind, and yet is that which amongst us is least attended to. This of fic∣titious history is not below our notice. The close connexion which every individual has with all that relates to MAN in ge∣neral
<PB N="167" REF="166"/>
strongly inclines us to turn our observation upon human affairs, in preference to other attentions, and eagerly to wait the progress and issue of them. But as the course of human ac∣tions is too slow to gratify our curiosity, observant men very early contrived to satisfy its impatience by the invention of <HI>his∣tory.</HI> Which by recording the principal circumstances of past Facts, and laying them close together, in a continued narration, kept the mind from languishing, and gave constant exercise to its reflections.</P>
<P>But as it commonly happens, that in all indulgent refine∣ments on our satisfactions, the Procurers to our pleasures run into excess; so it happened here. Strict matters of fact, however delicately dressed up, soon grew too simple and insipid to a taste stimulated by the <HI>luxury</HI> of art: They wanted something of more poignancy to quicken and enforce a jaded appetite. Hence in the <HI>politer</HI> ages those feigned histories relating the quick turns of capricious Fortune; and, in the more <HI>barbarous,</HI> the RO∣MANCES, abounding with the false provocative of inchantment and miraculous adventures.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"/>
But satiety, in things unnatural, brings on disgust. And the reader at length began to see that too eager a pursuit after <HI>adven∣tures</HI> had drawn him from, what first engaged his attention, MAN and <HI>his ways,</HI> into the Fairy walks of Monsters and Chi∣mera's. And now those who had run farthest after these delu∣sions, were the first that recovered themselves. For the next species of fiction, which took its name from its NOVELTY, was of <HI>Spanish</HI> invention. These presented us with something of huma∣nity; but in a forced unnatural state. For as every thing be∣fore was conducted by Necromancy, so all now was managed by <HI>intrigue.</HI> And tho' it had indeed a kind of <HI>life,</HI> it had yet, as in its infancy, nothing of <HI>manners.</HI> On which account those who could not penetrate into the ill constitution of its plan, yet grew disgusted at the dryness of the <HI>Conduct,</HI> and want of ease in the <HI>Catastrophe.</HI></P>
<P>The avoiding these defects gave rise to the HEROICAL RO∣MANCES of the <HI>French,</HI> here ridiculed by our Poet; in which some celebrated story of antiquity was so polluted by modern fable and invention, as was just enough to shew that the con∣trivers of them neither knew how to lye nor speak truth. In these voluminous extravagances, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> supplied the place of <HI>Life and Manners.</HI> But the over-refinement of <HI>Pla∣tonic</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="168"/>
sentiments always sinks into the dregs of the <HI>gentle passion.</HI> Thus in attempting a more natural representation of it in the little AMATORY NOVELS which succeeded those heavier volumes, tho' the writers avoided the dryness of the <HI>Spanish Intrigue,</HI> and the extravagance of the <HI>French Heroism,</HI> yet, by giving too natural a picture of their subject, they introduced a worse evil than a cor∣ruption of <HI>Taste,</HI> and that was a corruption of <HI>Heart.</HI></P>
<P>At length this great People (to whom, it must be owned, every branch of Science has been infinitely indebted) hit upon the true secret, by which alone a deviation from strict fact, in the commerce of <HI>Man,</HI> could be really amusing to an improved mind, or useful to promote that improvement.

<P>VER. 215. <HI>excuse some Courtly strains]</HI> We are not to under∣stand this as a disapprobation of Mr. Addison for celebrating the virtues of the present Royal Family. It relates to a particular fact, in which he thought that amiable Poet did not act with the ingenuity that became his character.</P>
<P>When Mr. Addison, in the year 1713, had finished his <HI>Cato,</HI> he brought it to Mr. Pope for his judgment. Our Poet, who thought the sentiments excellent, but the action not enough theatrical, gave him his opinion fairly, and told him that he had better not bring it upon the Stage, but print it like a classical performance, which would perfectly answer his design. Mr. Addison approved of this advice; and seemed disposed to follow it. But soon after he came to Mr. Pope, and told him, that some friends, whom he could not disoblige, insisted on his hav∣ing
<PB N="177" REF="176"/>
it acted. However he assured Mr. Pope that it was with no <HI>Party</HI> views, and desired him to satisfy the Treasurer and the Secretary in that particular; and at the same time gave him the Poem to carry to them for their perusal. Our Poet exe∣cuted his commission in the most friendly manner; and the Play, and the project for bringing it upon the Stage, had their approbation and encouragement. Throughout the carriage of this whole affair, Mr. Addison was so exceedingly afraid of party imputations, that when Mr. Pope, at his request wrote the fa∣mous prologue to it, and had said,
<Q><L>"Britons, ARISE, be worth like this approv'd,</L>
<L>"And shew you have the virtue to be mov'd.</L></Q>
he was much troubled, said it would be called, stirring the people to rebellion; and earnestly begg'd he would soften it into some thing less obnoxious. On this account it was al∣tered, as it now stands, to—<HI>Britons, attend,</HI>—though at the expence both of the sense and spirit. Notwithstanding this, the very next year, when the present illustrious Family came to the Succession, Mr. Addison thought fit to make a merit
<PB N="178" REF="177"/>
of CATO, as purposely and directly written to oppose to the schemes of a faction. His poem, to her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, beginning in this manner,</P>

<PB N="185" REF="184"/>
false manners in Tragedy escape unobserved; but unnatural action in Comedy lies hid from no body. Hence it is, that the difficulty of succeeding lies on the side of the comic writer. To support these observations, let me ask, from whence arises our disgust, when the scene in Comedy is laid abroad, and that of Tragedy at home. It appears, at first sight, whimsical and ca∣pricious, but has its foundation in nature. What we chiefly seek in Comedy is a true image of life and <HI>manners,</HI> but we are not easily brought to think we have it given us, when dressed in foreign modes and fashions. And yet a good writer must follow his scene and observe decorum. On the contrary, 'tis
<PB N="186" REF="185"/>
the <HI>action</HI> in Tragedy which most engages our attention. But to fit a domestic occurrence for the stage we must take greater li∣berties with the action than a well known story will allow. Not but perhaps another reason might be given for our disapprobation of this state of the scene. Comedy deals much in satire, Trage∣dy in panegyric: and our natural malignity will more easily suf∣fer us to find the <HI>ridiculous</HI> at home, than the <HI>heroic.</HI></P>

This did not take place but that afterwards he fell to it again, as was especially observed one night at supper at the Lord Bishop of Ely's, whither being brought by Mr. Casaubon (as I think) my Lord intreated him to stay to supper, which he did. There was present Dr. Steward and another Civilian, unto whom he flings out some question of that profession, and was so full of words, that Dr. Steward afterwards told my Lord, <HI>That he did perceive by him,</HI>

What betray'd our poet into this inaccuracy of expression was it's suiting better with the <HI>application.</HI> But in a great writer we pardon nothing. And such an one should never forget, that the
<PB N="209" REF="207"/>

<P>VER. 52. <HI>Bred up at home, etc.]</HI> The Reader may possibly have a curiosity to know something more of Mr. Pope's educa∣tion than what this verse tells him; and tho' much more would be too trifling to enter into a just volume of his life, it may do no dishonour to one of these cursory notes. He was taught his letters very early by an Aunt; and, from thence, to his eighth year, he took great delight in reading. He learn'd to write of himself by copying after printed books, whose characters he brought himself to imitate in great perfection. At eight, he was put under one <HI>Taverner,</HI> a Priest, who taught him the rudi∣ments of the Latin and Greek tongues, together: From him, in a little time, he was sent to a private school at Twiford near
<PB N="210" REF="208"/>
Winchester. Here, he continued about a year, and was then re∣moved to another, near Hyde-park Corner. Under these two last Masters he lost the little he had got under the Priest. At Twelve, he went with his Father into the Forest; where he was, for a few months, under another Priest, and with as little success as before. For, as he used to say, he never could learn any thing which he did not pursue with pleasure. And these miserable pedants had not the art of making his studies an amusement to him. Upon the remnants, therefore, of this small stock, so hardly picked up, so easily lost, and recovered (as we shall see) with so much la∣bour, he at length thought fit to become his own master. And now the only method of study he prescribed to himself was read∣ing those classic writers, who afforded him most entertainment. So that while he was intent upon the subject, with a strong ap∣petite for Knowledge, and an equal passion for Poetry, he in∣sensibly got Latin and Greek. And, what was extraordinary, his impatience of restraint, in the usual forms, did not hinder his subjecting himself; now he was his own master, to all the drudgery and fatigue of perpetually recurring to his Grammar and Lexicon. By the time he was fifteen he had acquired a very ready habit in the learned languages; when a strong fancy came into his head to remove to London, to learn French and Italian. His Family (whose only object was the preservation of his miserably infirm body) regarded it as a very wild project. But he persisted in it, and they gave way: to town he went; and mastered those two languages with surprizing dispatch. The whole treasure of Parnassus now lay open to him; and, between this and his twentieth year, his constant employment was read∣ing
<PB N="211" REF="209"/>
the most considerable poets and critics in the Greek, La∣tin, French, Italian, and English languages. But, all this, with∣out much order, as chance threw them in his way, or the ca∣price of desultory reading directed his choice. This being one continued indulgence of his curiosity or amusement, made him always speak of these four or five years as the most pleasurable part of his life.</P>
<P>Yet his true understanding would not suffer him to continue long the dupe of so defective an education. For a vast memory, and an accurate judgment, which remedied many of its incon∣veniences, made him but the more sensible of them all. So that, at twenty, when the impetuosity of his spirits began to suf∣fer his genius to be put under restraint, he went over all the parts of his education a-new, from the very beginning, and in a regu∣lar, and more artful manner. He penetrated into the general grounds and reasons of speech; he learnt to distinguish the se∣veral species of style; he studied the peculiar genius and charac∣ter of each language; he reduced his natural talent for poetry to a science, and mastered those parts of philosophy that would most contribute to enrich his vein. And all this, with such continued attention, labour, and severity, that he used to say, he had been seven years (that is, from twenty to twenty-seven) in unlearning all he had been acquiring for twice seven.</P>

VER. 65. <HI>He stuck to poverty with peace of mind,]</HI> There was something very singular in the Oeconomy of Mr. Pope's father. He was a Merchant, and lived in London. At the Revolution he left off trade, and converted his effects into money, amount∣ing to between fifteen and twenty thousand pounds, with which he retired into the country. As he was a Papist he could not purchase, nor put his money to interest on real security; and as he adhered to the interests of King James, he made a point of conscience not to lend it to the new Government: so he kept it in his chest, and lived upon the Principal; till, by that time his son came to the succession, it was almost all fairly spent.</P>

the important use of some late attempts to restore a better knowledge of our own. Which I observe with pleasure, as the growing prevalency of a different humour, first catched, as it should seem, from our commerce with the French mo∣dels, and countenanced by the too scrupulous delicacy of some good writers amongst ourselves, had gone far towards unnerv∣ing the noblest modern language, and effeminating the pub∣lic taste. This was not a little forwarded by what gene∣rally makes its appearance at the same time, a kind of femi∣nine curiosity in the choice of words; cautiously avoiding and reprobating all such (which were not seldom the most expres∣sive) as had been prophaned by a too vulgar use, or had suf∣fered the touch of some other accidental taint.

<P>VER. 174. <HI>Prune the luxuriant, etc.]</HI> Our Poet, at about fif∣teen, got acquainted with <HI>Walsh,</HI> whose candor and judgment he has celebrated in his <HI>Essay on Criticism</HI> Walsh encouraged him much, and used to tell him, there was one road still open for distinction, in which he might excell the rest of his countrymen, and that was by <HI>correctness,</HI> in which the English poets had been remarkably deficient. For tho' we have had several great Ge∣nius's, yet not one of them knew how to <HI>prune his luxuriancies.</HI> This therefore, as he had talents that seemed capable of things worthy improving, should be his principal study. Our young Author followed his advice, till habit made correcting the most agreeable, as well as useful, of all his poetical exercises. And the delight he took in it produced the effect he speaks of in the following lines,</P>
<Q><PB N="226" REF="224"/>
<L>Then polish all with so much <HI>life</HI> and <HI>ease,</HI></L>
<L>You think 'tis nature, and a knack to please.</L></Q>
<P>We are not commonly taught to expect this effect from correc∣tion; and it has been observed oftener to produce a heavy stiff∣ness, which by another image the ancients called <HI>smelling of the lamp.</HI> And without doubt this will, most an end, be the con∣sequence, when it is discharged with pain, and merely, as a task. But when it becomes an exercise of pleasure, the judg∣ment will lie no harder on the fancy than to direct its sallies; which will preserve the <HI>spirit;</HI> and the fancy will so lighten the judgment as to produce <HI>ease.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 175. <HI>But show no mercy to an empty line;]</HI> To such, our Poet was always inexorable. Unless it was once, when in the full blaze of his glory, he chose to sacrifice to envy, in that de∣voted and execrable line, in one of the best translated books of the Odyssey,
<Q><L>"Close to the Cliff with both his hands he clung,</L>

But there is a set of still lower Creatures than these, at the tail of which is one EDWARDS, who can make shift to subsist even on a Printer's blunder. The late Editor of Shakespear gave order to the corrector of the press, that all Mr. Pope's notes should be printed in their places. In one of these there was mention made, as they say, of some Italian novels (I forget whose) in which <HI>Dec.</HI> and <HI>Nov.</HI> were printed thus contractedly. But the printers of the late edition lengthen'd them into <HI>December</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and, in this condition, they are charged upon the Edi∣tor by this <HI>Edwards.</HI> Now, was the man such a Dunce to make his criticism with good faith, he is much to be pitied; was he

<P>VER. 176. <HI>Then polish all, etc.]</HI> A celebrated French writer says—<Q>“L'art d'être eloquent en vers est de tous les arts le plus difficile, et le plus rare.

<P>VER. 177. <HI>You think 'tis Nature, and a knack to please:]</HI> The reason is because we are wont to give to nature every thing that is plain, easy, and simple; without reflecting, that that artifi∣cial ordonance of words and expression, from whence this ease arises, is the effect of much study and application. It is true, that study is commonly observed to destroy this very ease, which, we say, arises from it. It may, and will do so in a common writer; but never, in a Genius. The precisely right expression is but <HI>one,</HI> while the meaning required may be tolerably con∣veyed in one <HI>hundred.</HI> But in such a croud, the search requires labour; and when you have hit upon the right, unless you have <HI>taste</HI> as well as judgment, you will never know, for certain, that it is the very thing you seek; so you go on till you be tired; and then the first that offers is received. Whereas a genius seizes it as soon as found, and never suffers the change to be put upon him by its counterfeit.</P>
<P>VER. 178. <HI>But ease in writing, etc.]</HI> That species of writers, which our Poet elsewhere calls
<Q><L>The mob of Gentlemen who wrote with ease,</L></Q>
understood this quality of a poem to belong only to such as (a cer∣tain wit says) were <HI>easily written;</HI> whereas he supposes it to be the last and most difficultly-attained perfection of a laboured work. But the <HI>Gentleman-writing,</HI> laughed at in the line above, and its opposite, which he somewhere calls <HI>prose run mad,</HI> are
<PB N="228" REF="226"/>
the two extremes of that perfect work, the idea of which he has here so well described from his own practice. As <HI>ease</HI> was the mode of the last age, which took <HI>Suckling</HI> for its patern; so an affected imitation of <HI>Milton</HI> has introduced a pompous hardness into the writings of the present. Which last Character Quinti∣lian describes very justly, and accounts well for its success,—<Q>“Evenit nonnunquam ut aliquid grande inveniat, qui semper quaerit quod nimium est; verum et raro evenit, et caetera vi∣tia non pensat.”</Q> I remember once, on reading a poem of this kind with Mr. Pope, where the Poet was always on the strain, and labouring for expression, he said pleasantly: <HI>This is a strange man: he seems to think with the Apothecaries, that Album grecum is better than an ordinary stool.</HI> He himself was never pompous; and if ever he inclined to hardness, it was not from attempting to say a common thing with magnificence, but from saying a great deal in a little room.</P>
<P>VER. 184. <HI>There liv'd</HI> in primo Georgii, <HI>etc.]</HI> The imita∣tion of this story of the <HI>Madman</HI> is as much superior to his ori∣ginal, in the fine and easy manner of telling, as that of Lucul∣lus's
<PB N="229" REF="227"/>
Soldier comes short of it. It is true the turn Horace's madman took, agrees better with the subject of his Epistle, which is <HI>Poetry;</HI> and doubtless there were other beauties in it, which time has deprived us of. For it is in poetry as in paint∣ing, the most delicate touches go <HI>first;</HI> and, what is worse, they agree in this too, that they are <HI>last</HI> observed. So that, what between time and ill taste, the greatest beauties are the shortest lived. But we need not wonder that ancient satirists should feel the effects of this fatal union, when those noble ones of so mo∣dern a date as Rablais and Cervantes are so little understood. One of the finest strokes in the latter is in the plan of his famous Ro∣mance, which makes a Spanish Gentleman of fifty run mad with reading books of Chivalry. But we see little of its beau∣ty; because we do not know that a disordered understanding is a common malady amongst Spanish Gentlemen in the decline of life. A fact which Thuanus occasionally informs us of, <Q>“Men∣doza étoit un fort habile homme, il avoit été employé en de grandes Ambassades—sur la fin de ses jours il devint furieux, comme d'ordinaire les Espagnols.”</Q> <BIBL>Thuana.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>THE SATIRES of Dr. DONNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>manly Wit</HI> of Donne, which was the Character of his genius, suited best with <HI>Satire;</HI> and in this he excell∣ed, tho' he wrote but little; six short poems being all we find amongst his writings of this sort. Mr. Pope has em∣bellished two of them with his wit and harmony. He called it <HI>versifying</HI> them, because indeed the lines have nothing more of numbers than their being composed of a certain quan∣tity of syllables. This is the more to be admired, because, as appears by his other poems, and especially from that fine one called the <HI>Progress of the Soul,</HI> his Verse did not want harmony. But, I suppose, he took the <HI>sermoni propiora</HI> of Horace too seriously, and so would imitate it literally, or rather was con∣tent with the character his master give of Lucilius,
<Q><L>Emunctae naris durus componere versus.</L></Q>
Having spoken of his <HI>Progress of the Soul,</HI> let me add, that Po∣etry never lost more than by his not pursuing and finishing that noble Design; of which he has only given us the Introduction. With regard to his Satires, it is almost as much to be lament∣ed that Mr. Pope did not give us a Paraphrase, in his manner, of the <HI>Third,</HI> the noblest Work not only of This, but perhaps of any satiric Poet. To supply this loss in some small degree, I have here inserted it, in the versification of Dr. Parnell. It will at least serve to shew the force of Dr. Donne's genius, and of Mr. Pope's; by removing all that was rustic and shocking in the former, and not being able to reach one single grace of the other.</P>

<P>Dr. Donne compares <HI>Power</HI> or Authority to Streams; and <HI>Souls</HI> to Flowers; but not being so explicite in the latter, Dr. Parnell overlooked that part of the Simile, and so has hurt the whole thought, by making the Flowers <HI>passive;</HI> whereas the Original says <HI>they leave their roots, and give themselves to the stream:</HI> that is, wilfully prefer human Authority to divine; and this makes them the object of his Satire; which they would not have been, were they irresistibly carried away, as the Imitation supposes.</P>

The frauds with which that work, so necessary for the welfare of the state, was begun; the rapine with which it was carried on; and the dissoluteness in which the plunder arising from it was wasted, had scandalized all sober men; and disposed the best Protestants to wish, that some part of that immense wealth, arising from the suppression of the Monasteries, had been reserved
<PB N="261" REF="257"/>
for Charity, Hospitality, and even for the public service of Re∣ligion.</P>
<P><SUP>a</SUP> He speaks here of those illiberal Advocates who frequent the Bar for mere gain, without any purpose of promoting or ad∣vancing civil justice; the consequence of which, he tells us, is a <HI>slavish</HI> attendance, together with the <HI>degradation</HI> of their parts and abilities. So that when they undertake to excuse the bad conduct of their client, they talk as idly, and are heard with the same contempt, as debtors, whose common cant is, that they were undone by <HI>Suretiship.</HI> The Imitator did not seem to take the fineness of the satire, or he would not have neglected an abuse of this importance, to fall upon such <HI>paultry things as Peter,</HI> and those whom he considered and so used as his <HI>patrimony.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="260"/>
VER. 104. <HI>So Luther etc.]</HI> Our Poet, by judiciously trans∣posing this fine similitude, has given new lustre to his Author's thought. The Lawyer (says Dr. Donne) enlarges the legal instruments for conveying property to the bigness of <HI>gloss'd civil Laws,</HI> when it is to secure his own ill-got wealth. But let the same Lawyer convey property for you, and he then omits even the necessary words; and becomes as concise and hasty as the loose postils of a modern Divine. So <HI>Luther</HI> while a Monk, and, by his Institution, obliged to say Mass, and pray in person for others, thought even his <HI>Pater-noster</HI> too long. But when he set up for a Governor in the Church, and his business was to direct others how to pray for the success of his new Model; he then lengthened the Pater-noster by a new clause. This
<PB N="265" REF="261"/>
representation of the first part of his conduct was to ridicule his want of devotion; as the other, where he tells us, that the <HI>ad∣dition</HI> was the <HI>power and glory clause,</HI> was to satirize his ambi∣tion; and both together to insinuate that, from a Monk, he was become totally <HI>secularized.</HI>—About this time of his life Dr. Donne had a strong propensity to Popery, which appears from several strokes in these satires. We find amongst his works, a short satirical thing called a <HI>Catalogue of rare books,</HI> one article of which is intitled, <HI>M. Lutherus de abbreviatione Orationis Do∣minicae,</HI> which shews he was fond of the joke. As his putting Erasmus and Reuchlin in the rank of Lully and Agrippa shews what were then his sentiments of Reformation. I will only observe, that this Catalogue was written in imitation of Rabelais's
<PB N="266" REF="262"/>
famous <HI>Catalogue of the Library of St. Victor.</HI> It is one of the finest strokes in that extravagant satire (which was then the Manual of the Wits) and so became the subject of much imita∣tion; the best of which are this of Dr. Donne's and one of Sir Thomas Brown's.</P>

The popish Doctrine of <HI>good works</HI> was one of those abuses of
<PB N="267" REF="263"/>
Religion which the Church of England condemns in its Articles. To this the Poet's words satirically allude. And having through∣out this satire had several flings at the Reformation, which it was penal, and then very dangerous, to accuse, he had reason to bespeak the Reader's candor, in the concluding words,

VER. 145. <HI>Why Turnpikes]</HI> In this recapitulation of modern abuses, he has imitated his original with great spirit. Amongst those which Dr. Donne mentions is
<Q><L>A Licence, old iron, boots, shoes, and egge-</L>

by this he means <HI>Monopolies,</HI> the most unpopular abuse of power of his time. It continued down thro' the reigns of Elizabeth, James, and Charles I. to the breaking out of the civil war. In the year 1633 the four bodies of the Law entertained the Court with a magnificent Mask. And one of their <HI>Anti-masks</HI> was an ingenious ridicule on the abuse of Monopolies; which Mr. Whit∣lock thus describes: <Q>“In this Anti-masque of Projectors (says he) came a Fellow with a bunch of Carrots on his head, and a
<PB N="281" REF="277" MS="y"/>
Capon upon his fist, describing a Projector who begg'd a pa∣tent of Monopoly as the first inventer of the art to feed Ca∣pons fat with Carrots, and that none but himself might make use of that invention, etc. Several other projectors were in like manner personated in this Anti masque; and it pleased the spectators the more, because by it an information was covertly given to the king of the unfitness and ridiculousness of these projects against the Law; and the Attorney <HI>Noy,</HI> who had most knowledge of them, had a great hand in this Anti-masque of the <HI>Projectors.”</HI></Q> This exorbitancy was become so common and fashionable, that Ben Johnson makes a cheating Procurer of Monopolies the chief character in one of his plays▪ just as he had done a cheating Alchymist in another.</P>

the reader expects it will conclude,—<HI>what Lady is painted.</HI> No, just the contrary,
<Q><L>what Lady is not painted,</L></Q>
satirically insinuating, that that is a better Proof of the goodness
<PB N="283" REF="279" MS="y"/>
of his intelligence than the other. The Reader sees there is greater force in the use of these plain words, than in those which the Imitator employs. And the reason is, because the satire does not turn upon the <HI>odiousness</HI> of painting; in which case the terms of a <HI>painted wall</HI> had given force to the expression; but upon the frequency of it, which required only the simple mention of the thing.</P>

But the irony in the first line, and the satirical equivoque in the second, mark them for his own. His making the objector say, that Horace excelled him in writing verse, is pleasant. And the ambiguity of <HI>putting their trust in Peter,</HI> insinuates that Horace and he had frequently laughed at that specific folly, arising from indolence, which still disposes men to intrust their spiritual and temporal concerns to the absolute disposal of any sanctified or unsanctified cheat, bearing the name of PETER.</P>

VER. 29. <HI>Seen him I have,</HI> &amp;c.] This and other strokes of commendation in the following poem, as well as his forbearing him on all occasions, were in acknowledgement of a certain ser∣vice the Minister had done a Priest at Mr. Pope's solicitation. Our Poet, when he was about seventeen, had a very ill fever in the country, which, it was feared, would end fatally. In this condition, he wrote to Southcot, a Priest of his acquaintance, then in town, to take his last leave of him. Southcot with great affection and solicitude applied to Dr. Radcliffe for his advice. And not content with that, he rode down post, to Mr. Pope, who was then an hundred miles from London, with the Doctor's directions; which had the desired effect. A long time after this, Southcot, who had an interest in the Court of France, writing to a common acquaintance in England, informed him that there was a good abbey near Avignon, which he had credit enough to get, were it not from an apprehension that his promotion would give umbrage to the English Court, to which he (Southcot) by his intrigues in the Pretender's service, was become very obnoxious. The person to whom this was written happening to acquaint Mr. Pope with the case, he immediately wrote to Sir Robert Wal∣pole about it; begged that this embargo might be taken off; and acquainted him with the grounds of his solicitation: He told him he was indebted to Southcot for his life, and that more than his life was engaged for the discharge of his obligation, for he was certainly to satisfy it in purgatory, if he could not do it here. The Minister received it favourably, and with much good-nature wrote to his brother, then in France, to remove this obstruction. In consequence of which Southcot got the abbey. Mr. Pope ever after retained a grateful sense of this fa∣vour.</P>
<P>VER. 31. <HI>Seen him, uncumber'd]</HI> These two verses were

originally in the poem, though omitted in all the first edi∣tions. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 34. <HI>what he thinks mankind.]</HI> This request seems some∣what absurd: but not more so than the principle it refers to. That great Minister, it seems, thought all mankind Rogues; and that every one had his price. It was usually given as a proof of his penetration, and extensive knowledge of the world. Others perhaps would think it an instance of a narrow contract∣ed understanding, that, from a few of Rochefaucault's <HI>maxims,</HI> and the corrupt practice of those he commonly conversed with, would thus boldly pronounce upon the Character of his species. It is certain, that a Keeper of Newgate, who should make the same conclusion, would be heartily laughed at.</P>
<P>VER. 37. <HI>Why yes: with Scripture</HI> &amp;c.] A scribler, whose only chance for reputation is the falling in with the fashion, is apt to employ this infamous expedient for the preservation of his momentary existence. But a true Genius could not do a foolisher thing to defeat his own aim. The great Boileau used to say on this occasion, <Q>“Une ouvrage severe peut bien plaire aux li∣bertins; mais un ouvrage trop libre ne plaira jamais aux per∣sonnes severes.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Why yes: with Scripture still you may be free;]</HI> Thus the Man commonly called <HI>Mother Osborn,</HI> who was in the Mi∣nister's pay, and wrote Journals; for one Paper in behalf of Sir Robert, had frequently two against J. C.</P>

<P>VER. 75. <HI>As, tho' the Pride of Middleton and Bland,]</HI> I am led by justice, as well as inclination, to explain the obscurity of this line, as far as it relates to the respectable person first named in it. The Poet had heard, amongst the numberless false reports, which the heat of party contests, at that time, pro∣duced, that Dr. Middleton highly approved of the Latinity and composition of the piece in question, and had expressed him∣self in those common terms of approbation, that he should have been <HI>proud</HI> to be the Author of it. It was of little im∣portance to enquire into the truth or falshood of the report, since what the Poet intended to say, on this occasion, was not to re∣flect on Dr. Middleton, whom he esteemed and had a personal regard for; but, on the contrary, to own the excellence of his judgment, in general, in words that only amount to this, <HI>though so able a judge as Dr. Middleton himself should approve the Latinity, I say it is bad and barbarous.</HI> In which he uses no greater freedom with this learned Man than he sometimes did with those he most valued, as Dr. Swift and others.</P>

<P>How highly our Poet thought of that truly great personage may be seen by one of his letters to Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> written at that time; in which, amongst others, equally respectful, are the following words: <Q>“The Queen shewed, by the confession of all about her, the utmost firmness and temper to her last mo∣ments, and through the course of great torments. What character historians will allow her, I do not know; but all her domestic servants, and those nearest her, give her the best testimony, that of sincere tears.”</Q></P>

Sir Richard Steele had once this post. And he describes the condition of it very well, in <HI>the Apology for himself and his writings:</HI> <Q>“My next appearance as a writer was in the quali∣ty of the lowest minister of state, to wit, in the Office of <HI>Gazetteer;</HI> where I worked faithfully, according to order, without ever erring against the rule observed by all ministers, to keep that paper very innocent and very insipid.

This useful citizen, after a run of ill luck, came one morning early into his master's bed-chamber, with two loaded pistols. And, as Englishmen do not understand raillery in a case of this nature, told the philosopher, on presenting him with one of his pistols, that now was come the time to put his doctrine in practice: that as to himself having lost his last stake he was become an <HI>useless</HI> member in society, and so was resolved to quit his <HI>station;</HI> and that, as to him, his <HI>guide, philosopher, and friend,</HI> surrounded with miseries, the outcast of government, and the sport even of that <HI>Chance</HI> which he adored, he doubtless would rejoice for such an opportunity to bear him company.

<P>The lines above have been commonly given as an instance of this ungenerous backwardness in doing justice to merit. And,

indeed, if fairly given, would bear hard upon the Author, who believed the person here celebrated to be one of the greatest cha∣racters in private life that ever was; and known by him to be, <HI>in fact,</HI> all, and much more than he had feigned in the imaginary virtues of <HI>the man of Ross.</HI> One, who, whether he be considered in his civil, social, domestic, or religious character, is, in all these views, an ornament to human nature.</P>
<P>And, indeed, we shall see, that what is here said of him agrees only with such a Character. But as both the thought and the expression have been censured, we shall consider them in their order.</P>

This encomium has been called <HI>obscure</HI> (as well as <HI>penurious.)</HI> It may be so; not from any defect in the conception, but from the deepness of the sense; and, what may seem more strange, (as we shall see afterwards) from the elegance of phrase, and exactness of expression. We are so absolutely governed by cus∣tom, that to act contrary to it, creates even in virtuous men, who are ever modest, a kind of diffidence, which is the parent of <HI>Shame.</HI> But when, to this, there is joined a consciousness that, in forsaking custom, you follow truth and reason, the in∣dignation arising from such a conscious virtue, mixing with <HI>shame,</HI> produces that amiable <HI>aukwardness,</HI> in going out of the fashion, which the Poet, here, celebrates.</P>

So that the Poet's elegant correctness of composition required, that his language, in the first case, should present something of negligence and censure; which is admi∣rably implied in the <HI>expression</HI> of the thought.</P>

<Q><L>She's still the same, <HI>belov'd, contented</HI> thing.</L></Q>
So that the sense of the text is this, <Q>“It is all one to <HI>Virtue</HI> on whom her influence falls, whether on high or low, because it still produces the same effect, <HI>their content;</HI> and it is all one to <HI>me,</HI> because it still produces the same effect, <HI>my love.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>VER. 144. <HI>Let Greatness own her, and she's mean no more,]</HI> The Poet, in this whole passage, would be understood to allude to a very extraordinary story told by <HI>Procopius</HI> in his <HI>Secret his∣tory:</HI> the sum of which is as follows.</P>
<P>The Empress THEODORA was the daughter of one Acaces, who had the care of the wild beasts, which the <HI>Green faction</HI> kept for the entertainment of the people. For the Empire was, at that time, divided between the two Factions of the <HI>Green</HI> and <HI>Blue.</HI> But Acaces dying in the infancy of Theodora, and her two Sisters, his place of <HI>Master of the Bears</HI> was disposed of to a stranger; and his widow had no other way of support∣ing herself than by prostituting her three Daughters, who were all very pretty, on the public Theatre. Thither she brought them in their turns as they came to years of puberty. Theo∣dora first attended her Sisters in the habit and quality of a
<PB N="315" REF="310"/>
slave. And when it came to her turn to mount the stage, as she could neither dance, nor play on the flute, she was put into the lowest class of Buffoons to make diversion for the Rabble; which she did in so arch a manner, and complained of the in∣dignities she suffered in so ridiculous a tone, that she became the absolute favourite of the people. After a complete course of infamy and prostitution, the next place we hear of her is at Alexandria, in great poverty and distress: from whence (as it was no wonder) she was willing to remove. And to Constan∣tinople she came, but after a large circuit thro' the East, where she worked her way, by a free course of prostitution. JUSTI∣NIAN was at this time consort in the Empire with his Uncle <HI>Justin,</HI> and the management of affairs entirely in his hands. He no sooner saw Theodora than he fell desperately in love with her, and would have married her immediately, but that the Empress <HI>Euphemia,</HI> a barbarian, and unpolite, but not illiberal in her nature, was then alive. And she, altho' she refused him nothing else, yet obstinately refused giving him this instance of her complaisance. But she did not live long: and then, nothing but the ancient Laws, which forbad a senator to marry with a common prostitute, hindered Justinian from executing this ex∣traordinary project. These, he obliged Justin to revoke; and then, in the face of the sun, married his dear Theodora. A ter∣rible example (says the Historian) and an encouragement to the most shameless licence. And now no sooner was THEODORA (in the Poet's phrase) <HI>owned by Greatness,</HI> than she, whom not long before it was thought <HI>unlucky</HI> to meet, and a <HI>pollution</HI> to touch, became the idol of the Court. There was not a single Magistrate (says Procopius) that expressed the least indig∣nation at the shame and dishonour brought upon the state; not a single Prelate that shewed the least desolation for the public scandal. They all drove to court so precipitately, as if they were striving to prevent one another in her good graces. Nay, the <HI>very soldiers</HI> were emulous of the honour of becoming the Champions of her Virtue. As for the common people, who had so long been the spectators of her servility, her Buffoonry,
<PB N="316" REF="311"/>
and her Prostitution, they all in a body threw themselves at her feet, as slaves at the footstool of their Mistress. In a word, there was no man, of what condition soever, that shewed the least dislike of so monstrous an elevation. In the mean time, Theodora's first care was to fill her Coffers, which she soon did, with immense wealth. To this end, Justinian and she pretend∣ed to differ in their principles. The one protected the <HI>blue,</HI> and the other, the <HI>green</HI> faction; till in a long course of intrigue, by sometimes giving up the one to plunder and confiscation, and sometimes the other, they left nothing to either party. <HI>See Procop.

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Paxton]</HI> Late sollicitor to the Treasury.</P>
<P>VER. 8. <HI>Feign what I will, etc.]</HI> The Poet has here intro∣duced an oblique apology for himself with great art. You at∣tack personal characters, say his enemies. No, replies he, so far from that, I paint from my invention; and to prevent a like∣ness, I exaggerate every feature. But alas! the growth of vice
<PB N="319" REF="314" MS="y"/>
is so monstrous quick, that it rises up to a resemblance before I can get from the press.</P>
<P>VER. 11. <HI>Ev'n Guthry]</HI> The Ordinary of Newgate, who publishes the memoirs of the Malefactors, and is often pre∣vailed upon to be so tender of their reputation, as to set down no more than the initials of their name. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 13. <HI>How, Sir! not damn the Sharper, but the Dice?]</HI> The liveliness of the reply may excuse the bad reasoning; otherwise <HI>the dice,</HI> tho' they rhime to <HI>vice,</HI> can never stand for it, which his argument requires they should do. For <HI>the dice</HI> are only the <HI>instruments</HI> of fraud; but the question is not, whether the <HI>in∣strument,</HI> but whether the <HI>act</HI> committed by it, should be ex∣posed, instead of the person.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="315"/>
VER. 26. <HI>I fain would please you, if I knew with what; Tell me, which Knave is lawful Game, which not?]</HI> I have observed, that our author has invented, and introduced into his writings, a new species of the <HI>sublime,</HI> by heightening it with <HI>wit.</HI> There is a species of <HI>elegance</HI> in his works (of which these lines are an instance) almost as peculiar to him, which he has produced by employing the <HI>simplest</HI> and tritest phrases to prevent stiffness, and yet, by a supreme effort of his art, giving them the <HI>dignity</HI> of the choicest. Quintilian was so sensible of the lustre which this throws upon true eloquence under a masterly direction, and of the pre∣judices against it from the difficulty of succeeding in it; that he says, <HI>Utinam—et verba in usu quotidiano posita minus timeremus.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 28. <HI>Must great Offenders, etc.]</HI> The case is archly put. Those who escape public justice being the particular property of the Satirist.</P>
<P>VER. 29. <HI>like Royal Harts, etc.]</HI> Alluding to the old Laws of the game, when our Kings spent all the time they could spare from human slaughter, in Woods and Forests.</P>
<P>VER. 31. <HI>As Beasts of Nature may we hunt the Squires?]</HI> The expression is rough, like the subject, but no reflection: For if <HI>beasts of Nature,</HI> then not beasts of their own making; a fault too frequently objected to country Squires. However, the La∣tin is nobler, <HI>Ferae natura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Things</HI> uncivilized, and free. <HI>Ferae,</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="316" MS="y"/>
as the Critics say, being from the Hebrew, <HI>Pere,</HI> Asinus silves∣tris. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 32. <HI>You know what I mean,]</HI> Considering the subject, it is not easy to know what he means.</P>
<P>VER. 35. <HI>You hurt a man that's rising in the Trade.]</HI> For, as the reasonable <HI>De la Bruyere</HI> observes, <Q>“Qui ne sait être un ERASME, doit penser à être <HI>Evêque.”</HI></Q> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 39. <HI>wretched Wild,]</HI> Jonathan Wild, a famous Thief, and Thief-Impeacher, who was at last caught in his own train and hanged. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 42. <HI>for the love of Vice]</HI> We must consider the Poet
<PB N="322" REF="317"/>
as here directing his discourse to a follower of the new system of Politics, That <HI>private vices are public benefits.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 51. <HI>why lay it on a King.]</HI> He is serious in the fore∣going subjects of satire; but ironical here, and only alludes to the common practice of Ministers, in laying their own miscar∣riages on their masters.</P>
<P>VER. 55. <HI>Strike? why the man was hang'd ten years ago:]</HI> The line is exquisitely beautiful. The high humour of it, in the un∣expected turn, is but it's second praise. It finely carries on the argument, which exposes the false rules and measures of satire, his <HI>Court Friend</HI> would inculcate for his practice, Ver. 28. insinu∣ates, that he is to avoid the proper object of satire, <HI>great offend∣ers,</HI> who have escaped public justice; and this, that he is to seize, in their stead, the little rogues, who have submitted to it.</P>
<P>VER. 57. <HI>Ev'n Peter trembles only for his ears,]</HI> Peter had, the year before this, narrowly escaped the Pillory for forgery: and got off with a severe rebuke only from the bench. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="318" MS="y"/>
VER. 64. <HI>feels for Fame, And melts to Goodness]</HI> This is a fine compliment; the expression shewing, that <HI>fame</HI> was but his <HI>se∣cond</HI> passion.</P>
<P>VER. 65. <HI>Scarb'row]</HI> Earl of; and Knight of the Garter, whose personal attachments to the king appeared from his steddy adherence to the royal interest, after his resignation of his great employment of Master of the Horse; and whose known honour and virtue made him esteemed by all parties. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 66. <HI>Esher's peaceful grove,]</HI> The house and gardens of Esher in Surry, belonging to the Honourable Mr. Pelham, Bro∣ther of the Duke of Newcastle. The author could not have given a more amiable idea of his Character than in compar∣ing him to Mr. Craggs. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 67. Kent <HI>and Nature]</HI> Means no more than <HI>art and nature.</HI> And in this consists the compliment to the Artist.</P>
<P>VER. 71. <HI>Secker is decent]</HI> These words (like those ℣ 135. of the first <HI>Dialogue)</HI> are another instance of the malignity of
<PB N="324" REF="319"/>
the public judgment. The Poet thought, and not without rea∣son, that they conveyed a very high idea of the worthy person to whom they are applied; to be DECENT (or to become every station of life in which a man is placed) being the noblest encomium on his wisdom and virtue. It is the very topic he employs in speaking of a favourite friend, one he most esteemed and loved,
<Q><L>Noble and young, who strikes the heart,</L>
<L>With ev'ry sprightly, ev'ry <HI>DECENT</HI> part.</L></Q>
The word in both places implying <HI>every endowment of the heart.</HI> As in that celebrated verse of Horace, from whence the expression was taken, and which no one has a better right to apply to him∣self than this excellent prelate:
<Q><L>Quid verum atque <HI>DECENS</HI> curo et rogo, et omnis in hoc sum.</L></Q>
So that to be <HI>decent</HI> is to excell in the moral character.</P>
<P>VER. 76. <HI>But does the court a worthy Man remove?]</HI> The poet means, <HI>remove</HI> him for his <HI>worth:</HI> not that he esteemed the being <HI>in</HI> or <HI>out</HI> a proof either of corruption, or virtue. <Q>“I had a glympse of a letter of yours lately (says he to Dr. Swift) by which I find you are, <HI>like the vulgar,</HI> apter to think well of people <HI>out</HI> of power, than of people <HI>in</HI> power. Perhaps 'tis a mistake; but, however, there is something in it generous.”</Q> <HI>Lett.</HI> xvii. <HI>Sept.</HI> 3, 1726.</P>
<P>VER. 77. <HI>Sommers]</HI> John Lord Sommers died in 1716. He had been Lord Keeper in the reign of William III. who took from him the seals in 1700. The author had the honour of knowing him in 1706. A faithful, able, and incorrupt mini∣ster; who, to the qualities of a consummate statesman, added those of a man of Learning and Politeness. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="320" MS="y"/>
VER. 77. <HI>Halifax]</HI> A peer, no less distinguished by his love of letters than his abilities in Parliament. He was disgraced in 1710, on the Change of Q. Anne's ministry. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 79. <HI>Shrewsbury,]</HI> Charles Talbot, Duke of Shrews∣bury, had been Secretary of state, Embassador in France, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Trea∣surer. He several times quitted his employments, and was of∣ten recalled. He died in 1718. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 80. <HI>Carleton]</HI> Hen. Boyle, Lord Carleton (nephew of the famous Robert Boyle) who was Secretary of state under William III. and President of the Council under Q. Anne. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Stanhope]</HI> James Earl Stanhope. A Nobleman of equal courage, spirit, and learning. General in Spain, and Secrètary of state. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 84. <HI>Chesterfield]</HI> Philip Earl of Chesterfield, commonly given by Writers of all Parties for an EXAMPLE to the Age he lives in, of <HI>superior talents,</HI> and <HI>public Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 88. <HI>Wyndham]</HI> Sir William Wyndham, Chancellor of
<PB N="326" REF="321"/>
the Exchequer under Queen Anne, made early a considerable figure; but since a much greater both by his ability and elo∣quence, joined with the utmost judgment and temper. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 92. <HI>And if yet higher, etc.]</HI> He was at this time ho∣noured with the esteem and favour of his Royal Highness the Prince.</P>
<P>VER. 93. <HI>Still let me say! No Follower, but a Friend.]</HI> i. e. Unrelated to their <HI>parties,</HI> and attached only to their <HI>persons.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 99. <HI>my Lord May'r.]</HI> Sir John Barnard, Lord Mayor in the year of the Poem, 1738. A Citizen eminent for his vir∣tue, public Spirit, and great talents in Parliament. An excel∣lent Man, Magistrate, and Senator. In the year 1747, the City of London, in memory of his many and signal services to his Country, erected a Statute to him. But his image had been placed long before in the heart of every good Man.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="322"/>
VER. 102. <HI>To find an honest man, etc.]</HI> In this search, in which he was very sincere, it would have been well if he had not sometimes trusted to the reports of others, who had <HI>less pe∣netration, but more passions</HI> to gratify.</P>
<P>VER. 116. <HI>What Richlieu wanted, etc.]</HI> The thing here in∣sinuated is, that the greatest character for <HI>Politics, Munificence,</HI> or <HI>Conquests,</HI> when separate from virtue, would never gain the praises of the <HI>true</HI> Poet. But <HI>munificence</HI> approaching nearer to Virtue than the other two qualities, he says, <HI>Louis scarce could gain;</HI> while <HI>Richlieu</HI> and <HI>young Ammon</HI> went without.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Louis scarce could gain,]</HI> By this expression finely insi∣nuating, that the great <HI>Boileau</HI> always falls below himself in those passages where he flatters his Master. Of which flattery he gives
<PB N="328" REF="323"/>
an instance in ℣ 231. where the topic of adulation is exceeding childish and extravagant.</P>
<P>VER. 120. <HI>To Cato, Virgil pay'd one honest line.]</HI> It is in the AEN.</P>
<Q><L>His dantem jura Catonem.</L></Q>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Virgil paid one honest line,]</HI> i. e. If Virgil, who was a Courtier, paid <HI>one</HI> honest line, how <HI>many</HI> are due from me, who am none?</P>
<P>VER. 121. <HI>O let my Country's friends illumin mine!]</HI> A pret∣ty expression, alluding to the old practice of illuminating MSS. with gold and vermilion.</P>
<P>VER. 127. <HI>I only call those Knaves who are so now.]</HI> He left it to Time to tell them,
<Q><L>Gato is as great a Rogue as you.</L></Q>
not the <HI>Cato</HI> of Virgil, but the <HI>Cato</HI> of Mr. Pope. See <HI>the Ep. on Riches.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 129. <HI>Spirit of Arnall!]</HI> Look for him in his place. Dunc. B. ii. ℣ 315.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="324"/>
VER. 130. <HI>Polwarth.]</HI> The Hon. Hugh Hume, Son of Alex∣ander Earl of Marchmont, Grandson of Patric Earl of March∣mont, and distinguished, like them, in the cause of Liberty. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 136. <HI>do I blame? Call Verres, Wolsey, any odious name?]</HI> The Leaders of Parties, be they as florid as they will, generally do their business by compendium: A single rule of Rhetoric, which they may have learnt of Quintilian, or perhaps of a much older Sophist, does their business, <HI>Si nihil, quod nos adjuvet, erit, quaeramus quid Adversarium laedat.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIB.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 141. <HI>When Paxton gives him double pots and pay,]</HI> If this <HI>band of Pensioners</HI> were so offensive while embodied and under discipline, what must we think of their disorders since they were disbanded and become free-booters? No virtue nor merit hath escaped them. They have made a great City in the South,
<PB N="330" REF="325" MS="y"/>
too much resemble another in the North, where the products of night and darkness are discharged from <HI>Garrets</HI> on every ho∣nest man that comes within their reach.</P>
<P>VER. 160. <HI>the Bard]</HI> A verse taken out of a poem to Sir R. W. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="326"/>
VER. 164. <HI>The Priest, etc.]</HI> Spoken not of any particular priest, but of many priests. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 166. <HI>And how did, etc.]</HI> This seems to allude to a com∣plaint made ℣ 71. of the preceding Dialogue. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="327"/>
VER. 185. <HI>Japhet—Chartres]</HI> See the Epistle to Lord Bathurst. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="328"/>
VER. 204. <HI>And mine as Man, who feel for all mankind.]</HI> From Terence: "Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum "puto." <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 208. <HI>Yes, I am proud; etc.]</HI> In this ironical exultation the Poet infinuates a subject of the deepest humiliation.</P>
<P>VER. 211. <HI>Yet touch'd and sham'd by Ridicule alone.]</HI> The Passions are given us to awake and support Virtue. But they frequently betray their trust, and go over to the interests of Vice. Ridicule, when employed in the cause of Virtue, shames and brings them back to their duty. Hence the use and im∣portance of <HI>Satire.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 214. <HI>To all but Heav'n-directed hands]</HI> <Q>“”The Citizen (says <HI>Plato,</HI> in his fifth book of Laws) who does no injury to any one, without question, merits our esteem. He, who, not content with being barely just himself, opposes the <HI>course</HI> of injustice, by prosecuting it before the Magistrate, merits our esteem vastly more. The <HI>first</HI> discharges the du∣ty
<PB N="334" REF="329"/>
of a single Citizen; but the <HI>other</HI> does the office of a Body. But he whose zeal stops not here, but proceeds to ASSIST THE MAGISTRATE IN PUNISHING is the most precious blessing of Society. This is the PERFECT CITI∣ZEN, to whom we should adjudge the <HI>prize of Virtue.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>VER. 219. <HI>And goad the Prelate slumb'ring in his Stall.]</HI> The good <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in his <HI>Evangelical Preparation,</HI> draws a long parallel between the <HI>Ox</HI> and the Christian <HI>Priesthood.</HI> Hence the dignified Clergy, out of mere humility, have ever since called their <HI>thrones</HI> by the name of <HI>stalls.</HI> To which a great Prelate of Winchester, one W. Edinton, modestly alluding, (who otherwise had been long since forgotten) has rendered his name immortal by this ecclesiastical aphorism, <HI>Canterbury is the higher rack, but Winchester is the better manger.</HI> By which, however, it appears that he was not one of those here con∣demned, who <HI>slumber in their stalls.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P><HI>VER. 220.</HI> Ye <HI>tinsel</HI> Insects! whom a Court maintains, That counts your <HI>Beauties</HI> only by your Stains, Spin all your <HI>Cobwebs] And again, to the same purpose, in the</HI> Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,</P>
<LG>
<L>Who breaks a <HI>butterfly</HI> upon a wheel?</L>
<L>Yet let me flap this <HI>bug with gilded wings,</HI></L>
<L>This painted child of Dirt, that <HI>stinks</HI> and <HI>stings.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>These, it is objected, are Insects not of Nature's creating, but the Poet's, and therefore such compound images are to be con∣demned. One would think, by this, that <HI>mixed qualities</HI> troubled the sense, as much as <HI>mixed metaphors</HI> do the style. But whoever thinks so, is mistaken. The fault of <HI>mixed meta∣phors</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="330"/>
is, that they call the <HI>imagination</HI> from image to image, when it is the writer's purpose to fix it upon one. On the contrary, <HI>mixed qualities</HI> do their office rightly, and inform the <HI>understanding</HI> of what the author would insinuate, that the <HI>mo∣ral</HI> insect is a more worthless creature than the <HI>physical,</HI> as he collects together, in one individual, many bad or trifling quali∣ties, which nature had dispersed in several. And when, in fact, we see them so collected; as venom, sophistry, and in∣sidiousness, in a <HI>Court-Butterfly,</HI> the giving it the <HI>bite</HI> of the bug, and the <HI>web</HI> of the spider, makes it a <HI>monster</HI> indeed, but a monster of nature's producing, and not the poet's,
<Q><L>cujus velut aegri somnia vanae</L>
<L>Fingentur species.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 223. <HI>Ye Insects—The Muse's wing shall brush you all away:]</HI> This it did very effectually; and the memory of them had been now forgotten, had not the Poet's charity, for a while, protracted their miserable Being. There is now in his library a complete collection of all the horrid Libels written and published against him;</P>
<LG>
<L>The tale reviv'd, the lye so oft o'erthrown,</L>
<L>Th'imputed trash, and dulness not his own;</L>
<L>The morals blacken'd, when the writings 'scape,</L>
<L>The libell'd Person, and the pictur'd shape.</L>
</LG>
<P>These he had bound up in several volumes, according to their various sizes, from folios down to duodecimos; and to each of them hath affixed this motto out of the book of Job:</P>
<P>Behold, my desire is, that mine adversary should write a book. Surely I should take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. <BIBL>Ch. xxxi. ℣ 35, 36.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 224. <HI>Cobwebs]</HI> Weak and slight sophistry against virtue and honour. Thin colours over vice, as unable to hide the light of Truth, as cobwebs to shade the sun. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="331"/>
VER. 228. <HI>When black Ambition etc.]</HI> The case of Cromwell in the civil war of England; and (℣ 229.) of Louis XIV. in his conquest of the Low Countries. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 231. <HI>Nor Boileau turn the Feather to a Star.]</HI> See his Ode on Namur; where (to use his own words) <Q>“il a fait un Astre de la Plume blanche que le Roy porte ordinairement à son Chapeau, et qui est en effet une espece de Comete, fatale à nos ennemis.”</Q> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="332"/>
VER. 237. <HI>Anstis]</HI> The chief Herald at Arms. It is the custom, at the funeral of great peers, to cast into the grave the broken staves and ensigns of honour. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 239. <HI>Stair;]</HI> John Dalrymple Earl of Stair, Knight of the Thistle; served in all the wars under the Duke of Marl∣borough; and afterwards as Embassador in France. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 240, 241. <HI>Hough and Digby]</HI> Dr. John Hough Bishop of Worcester, and the Lord Digby. The one an assertor of the Church of England in opposition to the false measures of King James II. The other as firmly attached to the cause of that King. Both acting out of principle, and equally men of honour and virtue. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 249. <HI>on the edge of Law:]</HI> From the summit of law is a dreadful precipice, which may well make Truth herself tremble. And from thence came the common proverb, <HI>Sum∣mum jus, summa injuria.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="333"/>
VER. <HI>ult.]</HI> This was the last poem of the kind printed by our author, with a resolution to publish no more; but to enter thus, in the most plain and solemn manner he could, a sort of PROTEST against that insuperable corruption and depravity of manners, which he had been so unhappy as to live to see. Could he have hoped to have amended any, he had continued those attacks; but bad men were grown so shameless and so powerful, that Ridicule was become as unsafe as it was inef∣fectual. The Poem raised him, as he knew it would, some enemies; but he had reason to be satisfied with the approbation of good men, and the testimony of his own conscience. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have so great a Trust in your In∣dulgence towards me, as to believe you cannot but Patronize this Imitation, so much in your own manner, and whose Birth I may truly say is o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to you. In that Confidence, I would not suppress the Criticisms made upon it by the Reverend Doc∣tor, the rather, since he has promised to mend the faults in the next Edition, with the same Goodness he has practised to Milton. I hope you will believe that while I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>press my Regard for you, it is only out of Modesty I conceal my Name; since, tho perhaps, I may not profess myself your admirer so much as some others, I cannot but be, with as much inward Respect, Goodwill, and Zeal as any Man,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Dear Sir Your most Affectionate and Faithful Servant</SALUTE></CLOSER>

<P>One RICHARD SMITH, a Book-binder and Prisoner for Debt within the Liberties of the King's Bench, and Bridget Smith, his Wife, were found, about 8 a Clock in the Morning, hanging in their Chamber, about 2 Yards distant from each other; and below in the Kitchen their little Child, about Two Years old, was found in a Cradle shot thro' the head. They were all neatly dress'd, in clean lin∣nen, a Curtain was drawn between the Man and Woman, a Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tol loaded lying near him, and a Knife by her. He was hang'd with a new Cord, which She was seen to twist a∣bout her hand the Day before. Upon the Nail which She hang'd on was a broken piece of Tape, besides the Cord, She was in, which was taken from the bed. She was 7 Months gone with Child, and when found, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm, but the Man quite cold. She was known to be a Papist, but the Christian Religion must have been quite defaced in both, by the wild notions in the following Letters which were left in the Room. One of which directed to their Landlord and two others inclosed to Mr Brindley, a Book-binder in New Bond street</P>

<P>IT is now about the Time I promis'd Pay∣ment to Mr. Brooks, which I have per∣formed in the best Manner I was able. I wish it had been done more to your Satisfaction; but the Thing was impossible. I here return you my hearty Thanks for the Favours, which I have received; it being all the Tribute I am able to pay. There is a certain anonymous Person, whom you have some Knowledge of, who, I am inform'd, has taken some Pains to make the World believe he has done me Services▪ I wish that said Person had never troubled his Head about my Affairs; I am sure he had no Business with them; for it is intire∣ly owing to his meddling that I came Penny∣less into this Place; whereas had I brought Twenty Pounds in with me, which I could easily have done, I could not then have miss'd getting my bread here, and in time have been able to come to Terms with my Plaintiff, whose menaces I believe could not have lasted always. I must not here conclude, for my meddling Friend's Man Sancho Pancho would perhaps take it ill, did I nor make mention of him; therefore if it lies in your Way, let Sancho know that his Impudence and Insolence was not so much forgotten as despis'd. I shall now make an End of this Epistle, desiring you to publish the inclos'd; as to the Manner how, I leave it intirely to your Judgment.

<P>THESE Actions, consider'd in all their Circumstances, being somewhat uncome∣mon, it may not be improper to give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome-Account of the Canse, and that it was an in∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erate Hatred we conceiv'd against Poverty and Rags; Evils that through a Train of un∣lucky Accidents were become inevitable; for we appeal to all that ever knew us, whether we were either idle or extravagant▪ whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o we have not taken as much Pains to get o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Living as our Neighbours, altho' not at∣tended with the same Success. We apprehend the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king our Child's Life away to be a Circumstance for which we shall be general∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondemn'd; but for our own Parts, we are perfectly easy upon that Head. We are satisfied it is less Cruelty to take the Child with us, even supposing a State of Anni∣hilation▪ as some dream of, than to leave her friendless in the World, expos'd to Ignorance and Misery; now, in order to obviate some Censures, which may proceed either from Ignorance or Malice, we think it proper to inform the World that we firmly believe the Existence of Almighty God; that this Belief of ours is not an implicit Faith, but deduced from the Nature and Reason of Things; we believe the Existence of an Almighty Being, from the Consideration of his wonderful Works; from a Consideration of his wonderful Works; from a Consideration of those in∣numerable, celestial and glorious Bodies, and from their wonderful Order and Harmony. We have also spent some Time in viewing those Wonders, which are to be seen in the minute Part of the World, and That with great Pleasure and Satisfaction; from all which Particulars we are satisfied that such amazing Things could not possibly be with∣out a first Mover, without the Existence of an Almighty Being; and as we know the wonderful God to be Almighty, so we cannot help believing but that he is also good, not implacable; not like such Wretches as Men are, not taking Delight in the Miseries of his Creature; for which Reason we resign up our Breaths unto him without any terrible Ap∣prehensions, submitting our selves to those Ways, which in his Goodness he shall please to appoint after Death. We also believe the Existence of unbodied Creatures, and think We have Reason for that Belief; although We don't pretend to know their Way of subsisting. We are not ignorant of those Laws made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> TERROREM, but leave the Disposal of our Bodies to the Wisdom of the Coroner and his Jury; the Thing being indifferent to us where our Bodies are laid; from whence it will ap∣pear how little anxious we are about a HIC JACET; we for our Parts neither expect nor desire such Honours, but shall content our selves with a borrowed Epitaph, which we shall incert in this Paper.</P>
