<HEAD>To His Grace the Duke of <HI>QUEENSBERRY</HI> and <HI>DOVER</HI>, Marquis of <HI>BEVERLY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have long lain under the greatest Obligations to Your Grace's Family, and nothing has been more in my Wishes, than that I might be able to discharge some part, at least, of so large a Debt. But Your Noble Birth and Fortune, the Power, Num∣ber and Goodness of those Friends You have already, have plac'd You in such an Independency on the rest of the World, that the Services I am able to render to Your Grace can never be advan∣tageous, I am sure, not necessary to You in any Part of Your Life. However, the next Piece of Gratitude, and the only one I am capa∣ble of, is the Acknowledgment of what I owe: And as this is the most publick, and indeed the only way I have of doing it, Your Grace will pardon me if I take this Opportunity to let the World know the Duty and Honour I had for your illustrious Father. It is, I must confess, a very tender Point to touch upon; and at the first fight may seem an ill chosen Compliment, to renew the Memory of such a Loss, especially to a Disposition so sweet and gentle, and to a Heart so sensible of filial Piety as Your Grace's has been, even from Your earliest Childhood. But perhaps this is one of those Griefs by which the Heart may be made better; and if the Remem∣brance of his Death bring Heaviness along with it, the Honour that is paid to his Memory by all good Men, shall wipe away those Tears, and the Example of his Life set before Your Eyes, shall be of the greatest Advantage to Your Grace in the Conduct and future Disposition of Your Own.</P>
<P>In a Character so amiable as that of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Queensberry</HI> was, there can be no Part so proper to begin with as that, which was in him, and is in all good Men, the Foundation of all other Vertues, either Religious or Civil, I mean good Nature. Good Nature, which is Friendship between Man and Man, good Breeding in Courts, Charity in Religion, and the true Spring of all Beneficence in ge∣neral. This was a Quality he possess'd in as great a Measure as any Gentleman I ever had the Honour to know. It was this natu∣ral
<PB REF="3"/>
Sweetness of Temper, which made him the best Man in the World to live with, in any kind of Relation. It was this, made him a good Master to his Servants, a good Friend to his Friends, and the ten∣derest Father to his Children. For the last, I can have no better Voucher than your Grace; and for the rest I may appeal to all that have had the Honour to know him. There was a Spirit and Pleasure in his Conversation, which always enliven'd the Company he was in, which, together with a certain Easiness and Frankness in his Dis∣position, that did not at all derogate from the Dignity of his Birth and Character, render'd him infinitely agreeable. And as no Man had a more delicate taste of natural Wit, his Conversations always abounded in good Humour.</P>
<P>For those Parts of his Character which related to the Publick, as he was a Nobleman of the first Rank, and a Minister of State, they will be best known by the great Employments he past through; all which he discharg'd worthily as to himself, justly to the Princes who employ'd him, and advantageously for his Country. There is no occa∣sion to enumerate his several Employments, as Secretary of State, for <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, for <HI>Britain</HI> in general, or Lord High Commissioner of <HI>Scotland</HI>; which last Office he bore more than once; but at no time more honourably, and (as I hope) more hap∣pily, both for the present Age, and for Posterity, than when he laid the Foundation for the <HI>British</HI> Union. The Constancy and Address which he manifested on that Occasion, are still fresh in every Body's Memory, and perhaps when our Children shall reap those Benefits from that Work, which some People do not foresee and hope for, now, they may remember the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> with that Gra∣titude, which such a piece of Service done to his Country deserves.</P>
<P>He shew'd upon all Occasions a strict and immediate Attachment to the Crown, in the legal Service of which no Man could exert him∣self more dutifully nor more strenuously. And at the same time no Man gave more bold and more generous Evidences of the Love he bore to his Country. Of the latter, there can be no better Proof than the share he had in the late happy Revolution; nor of the former than that dutiful Respect, and unshaken Fidelity which he preserv'd for Her present Majesty, ev'n to his last moments.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>With so many good and great Qualities, it is not at all strange that he possess'd so large a Share, as he was known to have, in the Esteem of the Queen, and Her immediate Predecessor; nor that those great Princes shou'd repose the highest Confidence in him: And at the same time, what a Pattern has he left behind him for the Nobi∣lity in general, and for Your Grace in particular to copy after.</P>
<P>Your Grace will forgive me, if my Zeal for Your Welfare and Honour (which no body has more at Heart than my self) shall press you with some more than ordinary Warmth to the Imitation of Your noble Father's Virtues. You have, My Lord, many great Ad∣vantages which may encourage You to go on in pursuit of this Repu∣tation; it has pleas'd God to give You naturally, that Sweetness of Temper, which, as I have before hinted, is the the Foundation of all good Inclinations. You have the Honour to be born, not only of the greatest, but of the best Parents; of a Gentleman generally belov'd, and generally lamented; and of a Lady adorn'd with all Vir∣tues that enter into the Character of a good Wife, an admirable Friend, and a most indulgent Mother. The natural Advantages of Your Mind, have been cultivated by the most proper Arts and Manners of Education, You have the Care of many noble Friends, and espe∣cially of an excellent Unkle, to watch over You in the Tenderness of Your Youth. You set out amongst the first of Mankind, and I doubt not but Your Virtues will be equal to the Dignity of Your Rank.</P>
<P>That I may live to see Your Grace eminent for the Love of Your Country, for Your Service and Duty to your Prince, and in conve∣nient time, adorn'd with all the Honours that have ever been con∣ferr'd upon Your Noble Family: That you may be distinguish'd to Posterity, as the Bravest, Greatest, and best Man of the Age You live in, is the hearty Wish, and Prayer of.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE; spoken by Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>TO Night, if you have brought your good old Taste,</L>
<L>We'll treat you with a downright English Feast.</L>
<L>A Tale, which told long since in homely Wise,</L>
<L>Have n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver fail'd of melting gentle Eyes:</L>
<L>Let no nice <HI>Sir</HI> despise our hapless Dame,</L>
<L>Because recording Ballads chaunt her Name;</L>
<L>Those venerable ancient Song-Enditers</L>
<L>Scar'd many a Pitch above our modern Writers:</L>
<L>They caterwaul'd in no Romantick Ditty,</L>
<L>Sighing for <HI>Phillis</HI>'s, or <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Pity.</L>
<L>Justly they drew the Fair, and spoke her plain,</L>
<L>And sung her by her Christ'an Name—'twas <HI>Jane</HI>.</L>
<L>Our Numbers may be more refin'd than those,</L>
<L>But what we've gain'd in Verse, we've lost in Prose.</L>
<L>Their Words no shuffling, double-meaning knew,</L>
<L>Their Speech was homely, but their Hearts were true.</L>
<L>In such an Age, Immortal <HI>Shakespear</HI> wrote,</L>
<L>By no quaint Rules, nor hampering Criticks taught;</L>
<L>With rough, majestick Force he mov'd the Heart,</L>
<L>And Strength, and Nature made amends for Art.</L>
<L>Our humble Author does his Steps pursue,</L>
<L>He owns he had the mighty Bard in View;</L>
<L>And in these Scenes has made it more his Care</L>
<L>To rouse the Passions, than to charm the Ear.</L>
<L>Yet for those gentle <HI>Beaux</HI> who love the Chime,</L>
<L>The Ends of Acts still gingle into Rhime.</L>
<L>The <HI>Ladies</HI> too, he hopes, will not complain,</L>
<L>Here are some Subjects for a softer Strain,</L>
<L>A Nymph forsaken, and a perjur'd Swain.</L>
<L>What most he fears, is, least the Dames shou'd frown,</L>
<L>The Dames of Wit and Pleasure about Town,</L>
<L>To see our Picture drawn, unlike their own.</L>
<L>But left that Error shou'd provoke to Fury</L>
<L>The Hospitable Hundreds of <HI>Old Drury,</HI></L>
<L>He bid me say, in our <HI>Jane Shore</HI>'s Defence,</L>
<L>She d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd about the charitable Pence,</L>
<L>Built Hospitals, turn'd a Saint, and dy'd long since.</L>
<L>For her Example, whatsoe'er we make it,</L>
<L>They have their Choice to let alone, or take it.</L>
<L>Tho', few, as I conceive, will think it meet,</L>
<L>To weep so sorely, for a Sin so sweet:</L>
<L>Or mourn and mortify the pleasant Sense,</L>
<L>To rise in Tragedy two Ages hence.</L>
</DIV1>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>EPILOGUE; spoken by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>YE modest Matrons all, ye virtuous Wives,</L>
<L>Who lead with horrid Husbands, decent Lives,</L>
<L>You who for all you are in such a taking,</L>
<L>To see your Spouses Drinking, Gaming, Raking,</L>
<L>Yet make a Conscience still of Cuckold-making,</L>
<L>What can we say your Pardon to obtain?</L>
<L>This Matter here was prov'd against poor <HI>Jane</HI>:</L>
<L>She never once deny'd it, but in short,</L>
<L>Whimper'd,—and Cry'd,—<HI>sweet Sir,—I'm sorry for't▪</HI></L>
<L>'Twas well she met a kind, good natur'd Soul,</L>
<L>We are not all so easy to controul:</L>
<L>I fancy one might find in this good Town</L>
<L>Some wou'd ha' told the Gentleman his own;</L>
<L>Have answer'd smart,— <HI>To what do you pretend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Blockhead!— As if I must n't see a Friend:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tell me of Hackney-Coaches—Jaunts to th' City—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where shou'd I buy my China—Faith, I'll fit ye—</HI></L>
<L>Our Wife was of a milder, meeker Spirit:</L>
<L>You!—Lords and Masters!—was not that some Merit?</L>
<L>Don't you allow it to be virtuous Bearing,</L>
<L>When we submit thus to your Domineering.</L>
<L>Well, peace be with her, she did Wrong most surely;</L>
<L>But so do many more who look demurely:</L>
<L>Nor shou'd our mourning Madam weep alone,</L>
<L>There are more Ways of Wickedness than one.</L>
<L>If the reforming Stage shou'd fall to shaming</L>
<L>Ill-nature, Pride, Hypocrisy, and Gaming;</L>
<L>The Poets frequently might move Compassion,</L>
<L>And with <HI>She</HI> Tragedies o'er-run the Nation.</L>
<L>Then judge the fair Offender, with good Nature;</L>
<L>And let your Fellow-feeling curb your Satyr.</L>
<L>What if our Neighbours have some little Failing,</L>
<L>Must we needs fall to damning and to railing:</L>
<L>For Her Excuse too, be it understood,</L>
<L>That if the Woman was not quite so good,</L>
<L>Her Lover was a King, she Flesh and Blood.</L>
<L>And since she has dearly paid the sinful Score,</L>
<L>Be kind at last, and pity poor <HI>Jane Shore</HI>.</L>

<P>WHEREAS all Gentlemen ought to fit themselves betimes for those Employments which naturally fall to their Share, prefera∣bly to the rest of their Fellow-Subjects; and that they, who design in particular to serve their Prince Abroad, are oblig'd to understand the Interests and Pretensions of Foreign States, as well as the Laws and Constitution of their own Country: It has been judg'd very serviceable by Persons of great Experience, to have the most celebrated Monsieur WICQUEFORT'S AMBASSADOR translated into the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, as being the only Book that perfectly exhausts this, Matter, little being written on the Subject by other Nations in comparison of the <HI>Italians</HI>, whose Books are too defective and abstracted for common Practice.</P>
