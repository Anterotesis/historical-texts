<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING is more easy than
to discover a Thing already
found out. This is verified
in Me and that anonimous
Gentleman, whom the publick Prints have
lately complemented with a Discovery to
prevent Street-Robberies; tho' by-the-by
we have only his vain <HI>Ipse dixit,</HI> and
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/>
the ostentatious Outcry of Venal News-Writers,
in his behalf.</P>
<P>BUT to strip him of his borrow'd
Plumes, these are to remind the Publick,
that about six Months ago, in a Treatise,
intituled, <HI>Augusta Triumphans, or the
Way to make LONDON the most
flourishing City in the Universe,</HI> I laid
down a plain and practicable Scheme, for
the total Suppression and Prevention of
Street Robberies; which Scheme has been
approved of by several learned and ju∣dicious
Persons.</P>
<P>OH! but say the Advocates of this
second-hand Schemist, our Project is to be
laid before the Parliament: Does that
make his better, or mine worse? Have
not many silly Projects been laid before
Parliaments e'er now? Admit it be not
<PB N="iii" REF="10"/>
the same, (as I have but too much reason to
fear it is) Cannot the Members of both
Houses read Print as well as Written-hand?
Or does he think they are so pre∣judic'd
to dislike a Thing the worse for
being offer'd without view of Gain? I
trust <HI>ANDREW MORETON</HI>'s Scheme,
generously offer'd for the Publick Good,
will meet with as fair a Reception as that
of this hireling Projector.</P>
<P>MINE is already publish'd; let him
generously follow my Example, and no
doubt, if his Scheme be preferr'd, the Go∣vernment
will reward him.</P>
<P>IF my Antagonist be necessitous, where
is the Merit? he does it for his own sake,
not for the Publick: If he be not ne∣cessitous,
what a sordid Wretch is he to
withold his Scheme for Lucre? putting it
<PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
up at Publick Sale; So that if you don't
give him his Price you shan't have it.</P>
<P>SOME People indeed are so fond of
Mysteries, they run down every thing
that is plain and intelligible; they love
Darkness, Whispers, and <HI>Free-Masonry;</HI>
despising whatever comes in the Shape of
a Pamphlet, be it never so useful or com∣mendable:
But in spight of Prejudice,
Truth is the Standard, by which I hope
all honest and impartial Men will judge
me.</P>
<P>THOUGH, I must confess, I am not
a little piqued to be jocky'd out of my La∣bours:
Yet not to be behind-hand with my
Gentleman in the Clouds, who would have
the Parliament buy his Pig-in-a-Poke, and
build up his Fortune at my Expence; I
have so amply enlarged and amended my
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>
Scheme, that it is now scarce like the
same. I have taken in every thing possible
of Comprehension or Practice: Nor have
I left him room to edge in one single Hint.
I have debated the Objections of divers
Wise and Learned Men, and corrected
my Project accordingly: So that on com∣parison
my first Thoughts will appear but
as a Rude and Imperfect Sketch, only
valuable in that it gave the Idea of this
more labour'd and finish'd Performance,
on which I pledge my whole Reputation,
being ready to stand or fall by its Success.</P>
<P>In order to which I have pre∣sented
Copies of this Book to the King
and Queen's most Excellent Majesties, to
several of the Lords Spiritual, and di∣vers
Honourable and Worthy Members of
both Houses; and Time must shew whose
Scheme shall have the Precedence.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="13"/>
In the mean time I stand prepared for
the Sneers of those who despise every thing
and every body but their own dear selves;
as also the Objections of the <HI>Puzzle Causes,</HI>
who will turry-lugg a thing out of all Sense
and Meaning; and by the cloudiness of
their Explanations darken what is most
plain and obvious. My Business is to
go straight forward, and let the End
crown the Work. If Men of Sense ap∣prove
me, I need not value the Laughter
of Fools, whose very Approbation is scan∣dal:
For if a thinking Man is to be laugh'd
out of every good Intention or Invention,
nothing will ever be done for the Publick
Good.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND
THOUGHTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE principal Encourage∣ment
and Opportunity given
to Street-Robbers is, that
our Streets are so poorly
watch'd; the Watchmen,
for the most Part, being decripid, super∣anuated
Wretches, with one Foot in the
Grave, and t'other ready to follow; so
feeble, that a Puff of Breath can blow
'em down: Poor crazy Mortals! Much
fitter for an Alms-house than a Watch-house.
A City watch'd and guarded by
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
such Animals, is wretchedly watch'd in∣deed.</P>
<P>Nay, so little Terror do they carry
with them, that hardy Thieves make a
mere Jest of 'em, and oftentimes oblige
even the very Watchman, who should ap∣prehend,
to light 'em in their Roguery:
And what can a poor Creature do, in
Terror of his Life, surrounded by a Pack
of Ruffians, and no Assistance near?</P>
<P>Add to this, that our Rogues are grown
more wicked than ever, and Vice in all
Kinds is so much wink'd at, that Robbery
is accounted a petty Crime. We take
Pains to puff 'em up in their Villainy, and
Thieves are set out in so aimable a Light
in the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> it has taught
them to value themselves on their Pro∣fession,
rather than to be asham'd of it.</P>
<P>There was some Cessation of Street-Robberies,
from the Time of <HI>Bunworth</HI>
and <HI>Blewit</HI>'s Execution, 'till the Intro∣duction
of this pious Opera. Now we
find the <HI>Cartouchian</HI> Villainies revived,
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
and <HI>London,</HI> that us'd to be the most safe
and peaceful City in the Universe, is now
become a Scene of Rapine and Danger.
If some of <HI>Cartouch</HI>'s Gang be not come
over hither to instruct our Thieves, we
have, doubtless, a <HI>Cartouch</HI> of our own,
and a Gang, which, if not suppress'd, may
be full as pernicious as was ever <HI>Cartouch</HI>'s,
and <HI>London</HI> may be as dangerous as <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI>
if due Care be not taken.</P>
<P>Not content with the Mischief done by
the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> we must have a
<HI>Quaker's Opera</HI> forsooth of much more
evil Tendency than the Former; for in this
<HI>Jack Shepherd</HI> is made the Hero of the
Drama, and runs through such a Scene
of Riot and Success, that but too many
weak Minds have been drawn away, and
many unwary Persons so charm'd with
his Appearance on the Stage, drest
in that elegant Manner, and his Pock∣ets
so well lin'd, they have forthwith
commenc'd Street-Robbers or House-break∣ers;
so that every idle Fellow, weary of
honest Labour, need but fancy himself a
<HI>Macheath</HI> or a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and there's a
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
Rogue made at once. Since therefore Exam∣ple
has such Force, the Stage ought to be
reformed, and nothing exhibited but what
might be represented before a Bishop: They
may be merry and wise: Let them take the
<HI>Provok'd Husband</HI> for a Pattern.</P>
<P>A good Physician seeks the Cause, and
weighs the Symptoms, before he proceeds
to prescribe; and if we trace this Evil from
its Radix, we shall find a Cause antecedent
to the two Operas aforesaid: Namely,
accursed <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Bane and Ruin of
our lower Class of People.</P>
<P>Those who deny an inferior Class of
People to be necessary in a Body Politick,
contradict Reason and Experience itself;
since they are most useful when Industri∣ous,
and equally pernicious when lazy:
By their Industry our Manufactures, Trade,
and Commerce are carried on, The Mer∣chant
in his Compting-House, and the
Captain in his Cabbin would find but lit∣tle
Employment were it not that many
Hands carried on the different Branches
of the Concerns they superintended.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="18"/>
But now so far are our common People
infatuated with <HI>Geneva,</HI> that half the
Work is not done now as formerly. It de∣bilitates
and enervates them, nor are they
near so strong and healthy as formerly.</P>
<P>So that if this Abuse of <HI>Geneva</HI> be not
stopt, we may go whoop for Husbandmen,
Labourers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trade must consequently
stand still, and the Credit of the Nation
sink: Nor is the Abatement of the Excise,
tho' very considerable, and most worthy
Notice, any ways comparable to the
Corruption of Manners, Destruction of
Health, and all the Train of Evils we
are threaten'd with from pernicious <HI>Ge∣neva.</HI></P>
<P>We
will suppose a Man able to maintain
himself and Family by his Trade, and at
the same time to be a <HI>Geneva</HI>-drinker:
This Fellow first makes himself incapable
of working, by being continually drunk;
which runs him behind-hand, so that he
either pawns or neglects his Work, for
which Reason no Body will employ him:
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
At last, fear of Arrests, his own Hunger,
the Cries of a Family for Bread, his na∣tural
Desire to support an irregular Life,
and a propense Hatred to Labour, turn
but too many an honest Tradesman into an
arrant desperate Rogue: And these are
commonly the Means that furnish us with
Thieves and Villains in general.</P>
<P>Thus is a Man, who might be useful
in a Body Politick, render'd obnoxious to
the same: So that if this Trade of Wick∣edness
goes on, they will increase
upon us so much that we shall not
dare to stir out of our Habitations; nay, it
will be well if they arrive not to the Im∣pudence
of plundering our Houses at Noon∣day.</P>
<P>Where
is the Courage of the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, that a Gentleman, with six or
seven Servants, shall be robb'd by one
single Highwayman? Yet we have lately
had Instances of this; and for this we may
thank our Essiminacy, our Toupee Wigs,
and powder'd Pates, our Tea, and other
scandalous Fopperies; and above all, the
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
Disuse of noble and manly Sports, so ne∣cessary
to a brave People, once in Vogue,
but now totally lost amongst us.</P>
<P>Let not the Reader think I run from
my Subject, if I search the Bottom of the
Distemper before I propose a Cure, which
having done, though indeed but slightly,
for this is an Argument could be carried
to a much greater Length, I proceed to
the Purpose in manner following.</P>
<P>Let the Watch be composed of stout
able bodied Men, and of those a sufficient
Number, that is to say, a Watchman to
every forty Houses, twenty on one side of
the way, and twenty on the other; for it
is observable, that a Man cannot well see
distinctly beyond the Extent of twenty
Houses in a Row; if 'tis a single Row,
and no opposite Houses, the Charge must
be greater, or their Safety less.</P>
<P>This Man should be elected, and paid
by the House-keepers themselves, to pre∣vent
Misapplication and Abuse, so much
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
complain'd of in the Distribution of Pub∣lick
Money.</P>
<P>He should be allowed 10 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI>
by each House-keeper, which at Forty
Houses, as above specify'd, amounts to
20 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> almost treble to what is
at present allowed; and yet most House-keepers
are charg'd at least <HI>2s. 6 d.</HI> a
Quarter to the Watch, whose Beat is, ge∣nerally
speaking, little less than the Com∣pass
of half a Mile.</P>
<P>What a Shame it is, that at least one
hundred Pounds should be collected in
some Beats, and the poor Watchman should
not have the one tenth Part of the Money?
And this I leave to the Consideration of
any House-keeper, who will take the
Pains to enquire into the Extent of a
Watchman's Beat, and after that cast up
what is collected in the said Beat: (as they
say for the Watch) But this is a small
Abuse in Comparison of other Parochial
Misapplications; for a Proof of which I
refer my Reader to a Treatise of mine,
Entituled, <HI>Parochial Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="22"/>
This Salary of 20 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> is
something of Encouragement, and a pretty
Settlement for a poor Man, who, with
Frugality, may live decently thereon, and,
by due Rest, be enabled to give due and
vigilant Attendance; that is to say, from
Evening Dusk, to Morning Light.</P>
<P>If a House-keeper break, or a House is
empty, the poor Watchman ought not to
suffer, the Deficiency should be made up
by the House-keepers remaining.</P>
<P>The Watch thus station'd, strengthen'd,
and enconraged, let every Watchman be
arm'd with Fire-Arms and Sword; and
let no Watchman stand above Twenty
Doors distant from his Fellow.</P>
<P>This has already been put in Practice
in the Parish of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s <HI>in the Fields,</HI>
and has had so good an Effect, that 'tis
hop'd other Parishes will follow their Ex∣ample,
which redounds not a little to the
Credit of our Project.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="23"/>
Let each Watchman be provided with a
Horn, to sound an Alarm, or in Time of
Danger; and let it be made penal, if not
Felony, for any but a Watchman to sound
a Horn in and about the City, from the
Time of their going on, to that of their
going off.</P>
<P>I know an Objection will be here made on
account of the Post-Boys, to obviate which,
I had Thoughts of a Bell, but that would
be too ponderous and troublesome for a
Watchman to carry, besides his Arms and
Lanthorn; whereas a Horn is portable,
always ready, and most alarming.</P>
<P>Let the Post-Boys, therefore, use some
other Signal, since this is most convenient
to this more material Purpose. They may
carry a Bell in a Holster, with Ease, and
give Notice by that, as well as those who
collect the Letters.</P>
<P>That the Watchmen may see from one
End of their Walks to the other, let a
convenient Number of Lamps be set up,
<PB N="11" REF="24"/>
and those not of the Convex Kind, which
blind the Eyes, and are of no manner of
Use; they dazzle, but give no distinct
Light, and further, rather than prevent
Robberies. Many Persons deceived and
blinded by these <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> have been
run over by Coaches, Carts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Peo∣ple
stumbling more, even under these
very Lamps, than in the Dark. In short,
they are most unprofitable Lights, and,
in my Opinion, rather Abuses than Be∣nefits.</P>
<P>Besides,
I see no Reason why every ten
House-keepers can't find a Lamp among
themselves, which would be four Lamps
in a Beat, and let their Watchman dress it,
rather than fatten a Crew of Directors:</P>
<P>But we are so fond of Companies, 'tis a
Wonder we have not our Shoes black'd by
one, and a set of Directors made rich at
the Expence of our very Black-guards.</P>
<P>The Watch ought to be in View, as
well as in the Hearing of each other, or
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>
they may be over-power'd, and much Dan∣ger
may happen.</P>
<P>The Streets being thus gloriously illu∣minated,
and so strongly guarded by stout
and able Fellows well arm'd and well
pay'd, all within the View of one another,
proceed we to secure all bye-Turnings,
Courts, Alleys, Lanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may
favour a Street-Robber's Escape and make
our Project ineffectual.</P>
<P>A Street, Court, Lane, Alley, or other
Place, where the Number of Houses or
Poverty of the Inhabitants will not afford
a Watchman on the Terms afore-men∣tion'd,
should be gated in, and the In∣habitants
let in and out by the Watchman
of the Street.</P>
<P>Where there are even but twelve Hou∣ses
in a Court, and the Inhabitants People
of Credit, they may have a separate Watch
to themselves, as it practised in <HI>Boswel-Court</HI>
by <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Angel-Court</HI>
in <HI>Throckmorton-Street,</HI> and many
other Places in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="26"/>
This I think an unexceptionable way
to secure the Cities and Suburbs of <HI>London</HI>
and <HI>Westminster.</HI> The only Difficulty I
can conceive is, that Persons after dark
may now and then go a little Way round
about by keeping the Street Way; but
the Pleasantness and Safety occasion'd by
the Lights and Watch aforesaid, make
ample amends. Let those go through
bye-Ways and in the dark, whose Deeds
are so: I am for providing Security for
Honest Men, and Obstacles for Rogues.</P>
<P>And now we have put a stop to their
Roguery, let us endeavour to suppress the
Rogues themselves: In order to which I
shall begin with their Harlots, who are
generally speaking, the first Motives to
their Villainy; and egg them on to all
manner of Mischief.</P>
<P>And these are generally Servant Wenches,
who stroll from Place to Place, and at last
weary of working, throw themselves on
the Publick: To maintain these Crea∣tures
many a Man turns Rogue. It be∣hoves
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>
the Government therefore to oblige
all young Wenches to keep in Service.
Masters and Mistresses ought likewise to
see that Servants of both Sexes go not a
rambling, when sent to Church; but that
they keep good Hours; for many have
been ruin'd by junketing and staying
out, instead of being at Church or at
home.</P>
<P>Our Common Women ought to be re∣strain'd
in the Liberties they have lately
taken: They openly swear and talk so
obscenely, 'tis a Shame to a Christian
Country.</P>
<P>Having fully handled this Topick in
two foregoing Treatises, <HI>viz. Every-Body's
Business is No-Body's Business,</HI>
and <HI>Parochial Tyranny,</HI> I shall not tire
my Readers with Repetition, but referring
'em to the Treatises themselves, return to
my Subject, which is,</P>
<P>After we have reformed the La∣dies,
let us take their Sparks in hand.
And first let all Shoe-Cleaners, I mean
<PB N="15" REF="28"/>
Boys and sturdy Vagrants be suppress'd,
according to my Scheme in <HI>Every-Body's
Business,</HI> &amp;c. As for Link-boys, <HI>alias</HI>
Thieves with Lights, there will be no
need of 'em, when the Streets are illumi∣nated,
according to my Project.</P>
<P>That Sailors as well as Soldiers may not
give cause of Suspicion, 'tis fit they should
also be quarter'd after the same Nature; and
more to enforce it, Surveyors of Quarters
should have Rounds allotted them.</P>
<P>These Surveyors should call at the
Quarters of every Soldier or Sailor at a
limited Hour, to see if they are there or
no, and register 'em at home or absent ac∣cordingly:
Absence to be penal.</P>
<P>Every Soldier or Sailor leaving his
Quarters 'till Morning after he has been
found at home and register'd, should be
punished.</P>
<P>I must be excused if I ward every Ob∣stacle,
my Design being to break up Street-Robbers
Nest and Egg.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29"/>
And that Thieves may not stroll about,
under pretence of being destitute of Lodg∣ing,
Barracks or Barns should be built at
convenient Ends of the Town, where all
Vagrants should be obliged to render
themselves at a stated Hour, where they
should have clean Straw allow'd 'em, and be
kept orderly and out of harm's way: They
may be let loose if they have apparent
means of honest Livelihood; otherwise
they should be sent to the Work-house of
their respective Parish, or to a General
Work-house, of which there is great need.
And of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>All Publick-Houses and Gin-Shops, if
they should be tolerated, should be shut
up at ten.</P>
<P>If the Government should think fit to
tolerate Gin-Shops, I see no Reason why
they may not be subject to Licences, and
come into the Pot-Act as well as Ale-Houses;
especially considering there is as
much Gin as Ale consumed now-a-days.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="30"/>
Night-Houses and Cellars above all
should be totally suppress'd: These are the
Harbours and Refuge of Villains and Strum∣pets:
These are their Houses of Call, where
their hellish Trade is carried on: It is
here they wait for the Signal of their
Scouts: Here they cast their Schemes, and
bring in Advices: Here they encourage
and initiate young Thieves: Here they
barter and sell their stolen Goods: These
are their Exchanges and Asylums after Mis∣chief.</P>
<P>Hackney
Coach-Drivers next require our
Care: They are the Scum of the People
and generally speaking the worst of
Rogues.</P>
<P>So many and such frequent Robberies
can never be committed without the Con∣nivance
of these Villains; and 'tis but too
much to be feared, that at the same time they
take up a Fare they take up a Robber, who
is ready to mark his Prey, and gets up
either on the Box or behind; and alights
at a convenient Place to perpetrate his
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
hellish Design. As for a Snack of the
Coal (as they term it) no doubt but the
Coachman and he have proper under∣standing
and Rendezvous.</P>
<P>Many who go to the Coach-Office
now-a-days, may be mistaken in their
hopes of Redress, not but the Com∣missioners
to a Man treat Complainants
wtth the utmost Civility; but the Penalty,
which used to be on the Renter, being now
on the Driver, the Renter or Owner
of that Figure is clear, and the Driver
has nothing to do but to be absent and
laugh at the Complainant, an Instance
of which take in the following Case.</P>
<P>A Hackney Coach-man took eighteen
Pence of a Gentleman for a twelve Penny
Fare: The Gentleman took his Number,
and complain'd; the Driver appear'd and
was fin'd fifteen Shillings, but the Renter
escap'd: What was the Result? the Driver
absconded, the Gentleman sits down at his
loss of Attendance and Money: Had
Robbery or Assault been the Complaint,
the Consequence had been the same, the
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>
Gentleman is but where he was. He has
since called several Times at the Office,
but to no purpose; all the Answer he can
get is, the Fellow can't be found. I
write this therefore to undeceive those
Persons, who think when they have taken
the Number of a Coach they can punish
the Driver for Insolence or Extortion.</P>
<P>The Law in this Case ought to be
turned into its old Channel, that is to say,
the Owner of the Figure should be an∣swerable:
He ought to employ a Driver
he can answer for, or drive himself.</P>
<P>Every Renter therefore should be o∣bliged
to Register and Respond for his
Driver; or Commissioners, Figures, and all
other Forms are to little purpose.</P>
<P>Beggars should next be suppress'd, who
lounge about all Day, to see where they
can steal at Night. It is a shame we should
suffer real Objects of Charity to beg; and
for those who are not so 'tis a shame but
they should work.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="33"/>
I shall close all with this Observation.</P>
<P>That the Extortions and Cabals of
Tradesmen, by enhaunsing the Prices of
Provisions, is most detrimental to a State,
and worthy the Notice of its Legislature:
For Men not being able to support their
Families by honest Labour, and being
made Beggars by reason of the Dearness
of Provisions, oftimes grow desperate and
turn Rogues. This Assertion is but too
true, to prove which I appeal to the late
Conduct of
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Coal-Merchants,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Bakers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Butchers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And above all the Tallow-Chandlers,</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Cabals of Coal-Traders have for
many Years jocky'd us in the Price of
Coals; they have raised and fell them at
pleasure, and made meer stock-jobbing
Work of it; but never so much as in his
late Majesty's Reign; on a great Impress
for Seamen, they in less than a Fortnight
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
rais'd the Price of Coals from twenty
three Shillings to almost fifty. What a
Pinch must this be on the Poor, who live
only from Hand to Mouth, and buy their
Coals (poor Souls!) some by the half
Peck.</P>
<P>The Bakers are yet more flagrant and
vile; they turn Plenty to Famine, and
push up the Price of Bread without Rule
or Reason; they have already been de∣tected
in one Bite, <HI>i.e.</HI> procuring some of
the Fraternity to buy a small Quantity of
Corn much above the Market Price, and
then by making oath thereof, abuse a
well intended Law, and raise the Price of
Bread accordingly.</P>
<P>Thus are the Poor ground to Dust, in
order to fatten a Pack of Misers, who
know no Mercy. But I hope the Go∣vernment
will make 'em honest, even
against their Will.</P>
<P>The Butchers are now so extravagant in
their way of living, that usual and mode∣rate
<PB N="22" REF="35"/>
Profit won't content 'em; they can't
drink Malt Liquor, and the Poor must
pay for the Wine which they swill down
at an unmerciful rate.</P>
<P>The Price of Meat should therefore be
regulated according to the Price of Cattle,
but not according to the Baker's Rule
afore-mention'd.</P>
<P>But as for the Tallow-Chandlers, their
Oppressions call aloud for Redress: To
what an exorbitant Pitch have they raised
the Price of Candles; just double what it
was some Years ago: Nay, they threaten
to have them at ten Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. How
can the Poor work when Candles are so
dear. But we may thank our own Lux∣ury
for these Impositions. I see no reason
why we should not humble these Upstarts
by making our own Candles; ay, and
our own Bread too, as our Forefathers have
done before us.</P>
<P>The Tallow-Chandlers, to excuse them∣selves,
lay the Fault on the Melters.
The Melters shift it from themselves to
<PB N="23" REF="36"/>
the Butchers: And so the Game goes
round.</P>
<P>Oh but say they the Government will
lose Part of its Revenue: To which I
answer, that rather than they shall
raise Candles to double their Value, on
pretence of paying a Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound Ex∣cise,
in case the Parliament will take off
the Duty on Candles for the ease of the
Poor, I will present 'em with a Project
<HI>gratis,</HI> which shall bring in almost double
the Money now levied by Candles; and
that without the least Hardship on the
Subject.</P>
<P>Having, I hope, taken sufficient care
of Street-Robbers, I proceed now to
clear the Roads from Highway-men,
Foot-pads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Let Parties of Horse be station'd at all
the Outgoings from the City of <HI>London;</HI>
so that if a Coach, Waggon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> want
a Convoy, two, three, or more may be
detach'd by the commanding Officer;
these shall be register'd, and answerable
<PB N="24" REF="37"/>
for their Charge; and for Encouragement
shall receive so much <HI>per</HI> Mile, or in the
Whole; <HI>Convoy Money.</HI></P>
<P>This may be likewise practised from
Town to Town all over <HI>England,</HI> so that
the Roads will be as safe as the Streets:
And they who will scruple the Trifle of
<HI>Convoy Money</HI> above proposed, merit not
Safety.</P>
<P>For those who walk on Foot to the
adjacent Villages, Parties of Foot may
be station'd in like manner; so that not
only the Subject will be free from Danger,
but the Soldier employ'd and prevented
from corrupt Measures by this additional
Perquisite to his Pay.</P>
<P>Nothing remains, but that Robbers be
prosecuted at the Publick Charge; the
Trials fix'd to respective Days, that Pro∣secutors
may not lose so much time; and
the Rewards paid in Court without De∣duction
or Delay: Nor should any Rob∣ber
be admitted an Evidence after he is
taken, or pardon'd after Conviction.</P>
