<HEAD>THE
Consolidator, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT Cannot be unknown to any that
have travell'd into the Dominions
of the Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that this
famous rising Monarch, having stu∣died
all Methods for the Encrease of his
Power, and the Enriching as well as Po∣lishing
his Subjects, has travell'd through
most part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and visited the Courts
of the greatest Princes; from whence, by
his own Observation, as well as by car∣rying
with him Artists in most useful
Knowledge, he has transmitted most of
our General Practice, especially in War
and Trade, to his own Unpolite People;
and the Effects of this Curiosity of his are
exceeding visible in his present Proceed∣ings;
for by the Improvements he ob∣tained
in his <HI>European</HI> Travels, he has
Modell'd his Armies, form'd new Fleets,
settled Foreign Negoce in several remote
Parts of the World; and we now see
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
his Forces besieging strong Towns, with
regular Approaches; and his Engineers
raising Batteries, throwing Bombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
like other Nations; whereas before, they
had nothing of Order among them, but
carried all by <HI>Ouslaught</HI> and <HI>Scalado,</HI>
wherein they either prevailed by the
Force of Irresistible Multitude, or were
Slaughter'd by heaps, and left the Ditches
of their Enemies fill'd with their Dead
Bodies.</P>
<P>We see their Armies now form'd into
regular Battalions; and their <HI>Strelitz Mus∣queteers,</HI>
a People equivalent to the <HI>Turks
Janizaries,</HI> cloath'd like our Guards,
firing in Platoons, and behaving them∣selves
with extraordinary Bravery and
Order.</P>
<P>We see their Ships now compleatly
fitted, built and furnish'd, by the <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Artists, and their Men of War
Cruize in the <HI>Baltick.</HI> Their New City
of <HI>Petersburgh</HI> built by the present Czar,
begins now to look like our <HI>Portsmouth,</HI>
fitted with Wet and Dry Docks, Store∣houses,
and Magazines of Naval Prepa∣rations,
vast and Incredible; which may
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
serve to remind us, how we once taught
the <HI>French</HI> to build Ships, till they are
grown able to teach us how to use
them.</P>
<P>As to Trade, our large Fleets to <HI>Arch-Angel</HI>
may speak for it, where we now
send 100 Sail yearly, instead of 8 or 9,
which were the greatest number we ever
sent before; and the Importation of To∣baccoes
from <HI>England</HI> into his Dominions,
would still increase the Trade thither, was
not the Covetousness of our own Mer∣chants
the Obstruction of their Advan∣tages.
But all this by the by.</P>
<P>As this great Monarch has Improved
his Country, by introducing the Manners
and Customs of the Politer Nations of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
so, with Indefatigable Industry, he
has settled a new, but constant Trade,
between his Country and <HI>China,</HI> by Land;
where his Carravans go twice or thrice a
Year, as Numerous almost, and as strong,
as those from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Persia:</HI> Nor is the
Way shorter, or the Desarts they pass
over less wild and uninhabitable, only
that they are not so subject to Flouds of
Sand, <HI>if that Term be proper,</HI> or to Troops
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
of <HI>Arabs,</HI> to destroy them by the way;
for this powerful Prince, to make this
terrible Journey feazible to his Subjects,
has built Forts, planted Collonies and
Garisons at proper Distances; where,
though they are seated in Countries in∣tirely
Barren, and among uninhabited
Rocks and Sands; yet, by his continual
furnishing them from his own Stores, the
Merchants travelling are reliev'd on good
Terms, and meet both with Convoy and
Refreshment.</P>
<P>More might be said of the admirable
Decorations of this Journey, and how so
prodigious an Attempt is made easy; so
that now they have an exact Correspon∣dence,
and drive a prodigious Trade be∣tween
<HI>Muscow</HI> and <HI>Tonquin;</HI> but having
a longer Voyage in Hand, I shall not de∣tain
the Reader, nor keep him till he
grows too big with Expectation.</P>
<P>Now, as all Men know the <HI>Chineses</HI>
are an Ancient, Wise, Polite, and most
Ingenious People; so the <HI>Muscovites</HI> be∣gun
to reap the Benefit of this open
Trade; and not only to grow exceeding
Rich by the bartering for all the Wealth
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
of those Eastern Countries; but to polish
and refine their Customs and Manners, as
much on that side as they have from their
<HI>European</HI> Improvements on this.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Chineses</HI> have many sorts
of Learning which these Parts of the
World never heard of, so all those useful
Inventions which we admire our selves so
much for, are vulgar and common with
them, and were in use long before our
Parts of the World were Inhabited. Thus
<HI>Gun-powder, Printing,</HI> and the use of the
<HI>Magnet</HI> and <HI>Compass,</HI> which we call Mo∣dern
Inventions, are not only far from
being Inventions, but fall so far short of
the Perfection of Art they have attained
to, that it is hardly Credible, what won∣derful
things we are told of from thence,
and all the Voyages the Author has made
thither being imploy'd another way, have
not yet furnish'd him with the Particulars
fully enough to transmit them to view; not
but that he is preparing a Scheme of all
those excellent Arts those Nations are
Masters of, for publick View, by way of
Detection of the monstrous Ignorance
and Deficiencies of <HI>European</HI> Science;
which may serve as a <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>icon Technicum</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
for this present Age, with useful Dia∣grams
for that purpose; wherein I shall
not fail to acqaint the World, 1. With
the Art of <HI>Gunnery,</HI> as Practis'd in <HI>China</HI>
long before the War of the <HI>Giants,</HI> and
by which those Presumptuous Animals
fired Red-hot Bullets right up into Hea∣ven,
and made a Breach sufficient to en∣courage
them to a General Storm; but
being Repulsed with great Slaughter, they
gave over the Siege for that time. This
memorable part of History shall be a
faithful Abridgement of <HI>Ibra chizra-le∣peglizar,
Historiagrapher-Royal</HI> to the Em∣peror
of <HI>China,</HI> who wrote <HI>Anno Mundi</HI>
114. his Volumes extant, in the Publick
Library at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> Printed in Leaves of
Vitrify'd Diamond, by an admirable
Dexterity, struck all at an oblique Mo∣tion,
the Engine remaining intire, and
still fit for use, in the Chamber of the
Emperor's Rarities.</P>
<P>And here I shall give you a Draft of
the Engine it self, and a Plan of its Ope∣ration,
and the wonderful Dexterity of
its Performance.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
If these Labours of mine shall prove
successful, I may in my next Journey that
way, take an Abstract of their most ad∣mirable
Tracts in Navigation, and the
Mysteries of <HI>Chinese</HI> Mathematicks; which
out-do all Modern Invention at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Rate, that 'tis Inconceivable: In this E∣laborate
Work I must run thro' the 365
Volumes of <HI>Augro-machi-lanquaro-zi,</HI> the
most ancient Mathematician in all <HI>China:</HI>
From thence I shall give a Description
of a Fleet of Ships of 100000 Sail, built
at the Expence of the Emperor <HI>Tangro</HI>
the 15th; who having Notice of the Ge∣neral
Deluge, prepar'd these Vessels, to
every City and Town in his Dominions
One, and in Bulk proportion'd to the
number of its Inhabitants; into which
Vessel all the People, with such Movea∣bles
as they thought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to save, and with
120 Days Provisions, were receiv'd at the
time of the Floud; and the rest of their
Goods being put into great Vessels made
of <HI>China</HI> Ware, and fast luted down on
the top, were preserv'd unhurt by the
Water: These Ships they furnish'd with
600 Fathom of Chain instead of Cables;
which being fastned by wonderful Arts
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
to the Earth, every Vessel rid out the
Deluge just at the Town's end; so that
when the Waters abated, the People had
nothing to do, but to open the Doors
made in the Ship-sides, and come out,
repair their Houses, open the great <HI>China</HI>
Pots their Goods were in, and so put
themselves in <HI>Statu Quo.</HI></P>
<P>The Draft of one of these Ships I may
perhaps obtain by my Interest in the pre∣sent
Emperor's Court, as it has been pre∣serv'd
ever since, and constantly repair'd,
riding at Anchor in a great Lake, about
100 Miles from <HI>Tonquin;</HI> in which all
the People of that City were preserv'd,
amounting by their Computation to about
a Million and half.</P>
<P>And as these things must be very useful
in these Parts, to abate the Pride and
Arrogance of our Modern Undertakers of
great Enterprizes, Authors of strange Fo∣reign
Accounts, Philosophical Transacti∣ons,
and the like; if Time and Opportu∣nity
permit, I may let them know, how
Infinitely we are out-done by those refi∣ned
Nations, in all manner of Mechanick
Improvements and Arts; and in discour∣sing
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
of this, it will necessarily come in
my way to speak of a most Noble Inven∣tion,
being an Engine I would recom∣mend
to all People to whom <HI>'tis necessary
to have a good Memory;</HI> and which I de∣sign,
if possible, to obtain a Draft of,
that it may be Erected in our Royal So∣cieties
Laboratory: It has the wonder∣fullest
Operations in the World: One
part of it furnishes a Man of Business to
dispatch his Affairs strangely; for if he
be a Merchant, he shall write his Letters
with one Hand, and Copy them with the
other; if he is posting his Books, he
shall post the Debtor side with one Hand,
and the Creditor with the other; if he be
a Lawyer, he draws his Drafts with one
Hand, and Ingrosses them with the other.</P>
<P>Another part of it furnishes him with
such an Expeditious way of Writing, or
Transcribing, that a Man cannot speak
so fast, but he that hears shall have it
down in Writing before 'tis spoken;
and a Preacher shall deliver himself to his
Auditory, and having this Engine before
him, shall put down every thing he says
in Writing at the same time; and so ex∣actly
is this Engine squar'd by Lines and
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Rules, that it does not require him that
Writes to keep his Eye upon it.</P>
<P>I am told, in some Parts of <HI>China,</HI> they
had arriv'd to such a Perfection of Know∣ledge,
as to understand one anothers
Thoughts; and that it was found to be
an excellent Preservative to humane So∣ciety,
against all sorts of Frauds, Cheats,
Sharping, and many Thousand <HI>European</HI>
Inventions of that Nature, <HI>at which only
we can be said to out-do those Nations.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, I have not yet had leisure to
travel those Parts, having been di∣verted
by an accidental Opportunity of a
new Voyage I had occasion to make for
farther Discoveries, and which the Plea∣sure
and Usefulness thereof having been
very great, I have omitted the other for
the present, but shall not fail to make a
Visit to those Parts the first Opportunity,
and shall give my Country-men the best
Account I can of those things; for I
doubt not in Time to bring our Nation,
so fam'd for improving other People's
Discoveries, to be as wise as any of those
Heathen Nations; I wish I had the same
Prospect of making them half so honest.
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
I had spent but a few Months in this
Country, but my search after the Prodigy
of humane Knowledge the People a∣bounds
with, led me into Acquaintance
with some of their principal Artists, En∣gineers,
and Men of Letters; and I was
astonish'd at every Day's Discovery of
new and of unheard-of Worlds of Learn∣ing;
but I Improv'd in the Superficial
Knowledge of their General, by no body
so much as by my Conversation with the
Library-keeper of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> by whom I
had Admission into the vast Collection of
Books, which the Emperors of that Coun∣try
have treasur'd up.</P>
<P>It would be endless to give you a Ca∣talogue,
and they admit of no Strangers
to write any thing down, but what the
Memory can retain, you are welcome to
carry away with you; and amongst the
wonderful Volumes of Antient and Mo∣dern
Learning, I could not but take No∣tice
of a few; which, besides those I
mentioned before, I saw, when I lookt
over this vast Collection; and a larger
Account may be given our next.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
It would be needless to Transcribe the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Character, or to put their Alpha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bet
into our Letters, because the Word
would be both Unintelligible, and very
hard to Pronounce; and therefore, to
avoid hard Words, and Hyroglyphicks
I'll translate them as well as I can.</P>
<P>The first Class I came to of Books, was
the Constitutions of the Empire; these
are vast great Volumes, and have a sort of
Engine like our <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> to remove
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, and with placing them in a Frame, by
turning a Screw, open'd the Leaves, and
folded them this way, or that, as the
Reader desires. It was present Death for
the Library-keeper to refuse the meanest
<HI>Chinese</HI> Subject to come in and read them
for 'tis their Maxim, <HI>That all People ought
to know the Laws by which they are to be go∣vern'd;</HI>
and as above all People, we find
no Fools in this Country; so the Empe∣rors,
though they seem to be Arbitrary,
enjoy the greatest Authority in the World,
by always observing, with the greatest
Exactness, the <HI>Pacta Conventa</HI> of their
Government▪ From these Principles it
is impossible we should ever hear, either
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
of the Tyranny of Princes, or Rebellion
of Subjects, in all their Histories.</P>
<P>At the Entrance into this Class, you
find some Ancient Comments, upon the
Constitution of the Empire, written ma∣ny
Ages before we pretend the World
began; but above all, One I took parti∣cular
notice of, which might bear this
Title, <HI>Natural Right prov'd Superior to
Temporal Power;</HI> wherein the old Author
proves, <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors were Origi∣nally
made so, by Nature's directing the
People, to place the Power of Govern∣ment
in the most worthy Person they
could find; and the Author giving a most
exact History of 2000 Emperors, brings
them into about 35 or 36 Periods of Lines
when the Race ended; and when a Col∣lective
Assembly of the Nobles, Cities,
and People, Nominated a new Family to
the Government.</P>
<P>This being an heretical Book as to <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Politicks, and our Learned Au∣thors
having long since exploded this Do∣ctrine,
and prov'd that Kings and Em∣perors
came down from Heaven with
Crowns on their Heads, and all their Sub∣jects
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
were born with Saddles on the
Backs; I thought fit to leave it where
found it, least our excellent Tracts of Sir
<HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> L... <HI>y, S..</HI>
and Others, who have so learnedly treat∣ed
of the more useful Doctrine of Passive
Obedience, Divine Right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be
blasphem'd' by the Mob, grow into Con∣tempt
of the People; and they should
take upon them to question their Supe∣riors
for the Blood of <HI>Algernon Sidney</HI>
and <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>
<P>For I take the Doctrines of Passive O∣bedience,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> among the States-men, to
be like the Copernican System of the
Earths Motion among Philosophers;
which, though it be contrary to all an∣tient
Knowledge, and not capable of
Demonstration, yet is adher'd to in gene∣ral,
because by this they can better solve,
and give a more rational Account of se∣veral
dark Phaenomena in Nature, than
they could before.</P>
<P>Thus our Modern States-men approve
of this Scheme of Government; not that
it admits of any rational Defence, much
less of Demonstration, but because by
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
this Method they can the better ex∣plain,
as well as defend, all Coertion in
Cases invasive of Natural Right, than they
could before.</P>
<P>Here I found two famous Volumes in
Chyrurgery, being an exact Description of
the Circulation of the Blood, discovered
long before King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Allegory of
the Bucket's going to the Well; with se∣veral
curious Methods by which the De∣monstration
was to be made so plain, as
would make even the worthy Doctor
<HI>B</HI>—himself become a Convert to his
own Eye-sight, make him damn his own
Elaborate Book, and think it worse Non∣sence
than ever the Town had the Free∣dom
to imagine.</P>
<P>All our Philosophers are Fools, and
their Transactions a parcel of empty Stuff, to
the Experiments of the Royal Societies
in this Country. Here I came to a Learn∣ed
Tract of Winds, which outdoes even
the Sacred Text, and would make us be∣lieve
it was not wrote to those People;
they tell Folks whence it comes, and
whither it goes. There you have an
Account how to make Glasses of Hogs
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Eyes, that can see the Wind; and the
give strange Accounts both of its regular
and irregular Motions, its Compositions
and Quantities; from whence, by a sort
of Algebra, they can cast up its Dura∣tion,
Violence, and Extent: In these
Calculations, some say, those Author<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have been so exact, that they can, as our
Philosophers say of Comets, state their
Revolutions, and tell us how many
Storms there shall happen to any Period
of time, and when; and perhaps this
may be with much about the same
Truth.</P>
<P>It was a certain Sign <HI>Aristotle</HI> had never
been at <HI>China;</HI> for, had he seen the 216th
Volume of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Navigation, in
the Library I am speaking of, a large Book
in Double Folio, wrote by the Famous
<HI>Mira-cho-cho-lasmo,</HI> Vice-Admiral of <HI>Chi∣na,</HI>
and said to be printed there about
2000 Years before the Deluge, in the
Chapter of Tides he would have seen the
Reason of all the certain and uncertain
Fluxes and Refluxes of that Element<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
how the exact Pace is kept between the
Moon and the Tides, with a most elabor∣rate
Discourse there, of the Power of
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Sympathy, and the manner how the hea∣venly
Bodies Influence the Earthly: Had
he seen this, the <HI>Stagyrite</HI> would never
have Drowned himself, because he could
not comprehend this Mystery.</P>
<P>'Tis farther related of this Famous Au∣thor,
that he was no Native of this World,
but was Born in the <HI>Moon,</HI> and coming hi∣ther
to make Discoveries, by a strange In∣vention
arrived to by the <HI>Virtuosoes</HI> of that
habitable World, the Emperor of <HI>China</HI>
prevailed with him to stay and improve his
Subjects, in the most exquisite Accom∣plishments
of those <HI>Lunar</HI> Regions; and
no wonder the <HI>Chinese</HI> are such exquisite
Artists, and Masters of such sublime Know∣ledge,
when this Famous Author has blest
them with such unaccountable Methods
of Improvement.</P>
<P>There was abundance of vast Classes
full of the Works of this wonderful Phi∣losopher:
He gave the <HI>how,</HI> the <HI>modus</HI> of
all the secret Operations of Nature; and
told us, how Sensation is convey'd to and
from the Brain; why Respiration pre∣serves
Life; and how Locomotion is
directed to, as well as perform'd by the
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Parts. There are some Anatomical Dis∣sections
of Thought, and a Mathematical
Description of Nature's strong Box, the
Memory, with all its Locks and Keys.</P>
<P>There you have that part of the Head
turn'd in-side outward, in which Nature
has placed the Materials of reflecting;
and like a <HI>Glass Bee-hive,</HI> represents to
you all the several Cells in which are
lodg'd things past, even back to Infancy
and Conception. There you have the
Repository, with all its Cells, Classically,
Annually, Numerically, and Alphabeti∣cally
Dispos'd. There you may see how,
when the perplext Animal, on the loss
of a Thought or Word, <HI>scratches his Pole:</HI>
Every Attack of his Invading Fingers
knocks at Nature's Door, allarms all the
Register-keepers, and away they run,
unlock all the Classes, search diligently
for what he calls for, and immediately
deliver it up to the Brain; if it cannot
be found, they intreat a <HI>little Patience,</HI>
till they step into the <HI>Revolvary,</HI> where
they run over little Catalogues of the mi∣nutest
Passages of Life, and so in time ne∣ver
fail to hand on the thing; if not just
when he calls for it, yet at some other
time.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
And thug, when a thing lyes very Ab∣struse,
and all the rumaging of the whole
House cannot find it; nay, when all the
People in the House have given it over,
they very often find one thing when they
are looking for another.</P>
<P>Next you have the <HI>Retentive</HI> in the re∣motest
part of the Place, which, like the
Records in the Tower, takes Possession
of all Matters, as they are removed from
the Classes in the Repository, for want
of room. These are carefully Lockt, and
kept safe, never to be open'd but upon
solemn Occasions, and have swinging
great Bars and Bolts upon them; so that
what is kept here, is seldom lost. Here
<HI>Conscience</HI> has one large Ware-house, and
the <HI>Devil</HI> another; the first is very sel∣dom
open'd, but has a Chink or Till,
where all the Follies and Crimes of Life
being minuted are dropt in; but as the
Man seldom cares to look in, the Locks
are very Rusty, and not open'd but with
great Difficulty, and on extraordinary
Occasions, as Sickness, Afflictions, Jails,
Casualties, and Death; and then the
Bars all give way at once; and being
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
prest from within with a more than ordi∣nary
Weight, burst as a Cask of Win<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon the Fret, which for want of Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
makes all the Hoops fly.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ware-house, he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two constant Warehouse-keepers, <HI>Prid</HI>
and <HI>Conceit,</HI> and these are always at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

In another Angle is to be seen the
<HI>Memory's Garden,</HI> in which her most plea∣sant
things are not only Deposited, but
Planted, Transplanted, Grafted, Ino∣culated,
and obtain all possible Propaga∣tion
and Encrease; these are the most
pleasant, delightful, and agreeable things,
call'd Envy, Slander, Revenge, Strife and
Malice, with the Additions of Ill-turns,
Reproaches, and all manner of Wrong;
these are caressed in the Cabinet of the
<HI>Memory,</HI> with a World of Pleasure never
let pass, and carefully Cultivated with
all imaginable Art.</P>
<P>There are multitudes of Weeds, Toys,
Chat, Story, Fiction, and Lying, which
in the great throng of passant Affairs,
stop by the way, and crowding up the
Place, leave no room for their Betters
that come behind, which makes many a
good Guess be put by, and left to go
clear thro' for want of Entertainment.</P>
<P>There are a multitude of things very
curious and observable, concerning this
little, but very accurate thing, called
<HI>Memory;</HI> but above all, I see nothing so
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
very curious, as the wonderful Art of
<HI>Wilful Forgetfulness;</HI> and as 'tis a thing,
indeed, I never could find any Person
compleatly Master of, it pleased me very
much, to find this Author has made a
large Essay, to prove there is really no
such Power in Nature; and that the Pre∣tenders
to it are all Impostors, and put a
Banter upon the World; for that it is
impossible for any Man to oblige himself
to forget a thing, since he that can re∣member
to forget, and at the same time
forget to remember, has an Art above
the Devil.</P>
<P>In his Laboratory you see <HI>a Fancy</HI> pre∣serv'd
<HI>a la Mummy,</HI> several Thousand
Years old; by examining which you
may perfectly discern, how Nature makes
a Poet: Another you have taken from a
meer Natural, which discovers the Rea∣sons
of Nature's Negative in the Case of
humane Understanding; what Depriva∣tion
of Parts She su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is, in the Compo∣sition
of a Coxcomb; and with what
wonderful Art She prepares a Man to be
a Fool.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Here being the product of this Author's
wonderful Skill, you have the <HI>Skeleton of a
Wit,</HI> with all the Readings of Philosophy
and Chyrurgery upon the Parts: Here you
see all the Lines Nature has drawn to
form <HI>a Genius,</HI> how it performs, and from
what Principles.</P>
<P>Also you are Instructed to know the
true reason of the Affinity between Poe∣try
and Poverty; and that it is equally
derived from what's Natural and Intrin∣sick,
as from Accident and Circumstance;
how the World being always full of Fools
find Knaves, Wit is sure to miss of a good
Market; especially, if Wit and Truth
happen to come in Company; for the
Fools don't understand it, and the Knaves
can't bear it.</P>
<P>But sftill 'tis own'd, and is most appa∣rent,
there is something also Natural in
the Case too, since there are some parti∣cular
Vessels Nature thinks necessary, to
the more exact Composition of this nice
thing call'd <HI>a Wit,</HI> which as they are, or
are not Interrupted in the peculiar Offices
for which they are appointed, are sub∣ject
to various Distempers, and more
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
particularly to Effluxions and Vapours,
<HI>Diliriums</HI> Giddiness of the Brain, and
<HI>Lapsae,</HI> or <HI>Looseness of the Tongue;</HI> and as
these Distempers, occasion'd by the ex∣ceeding
quantity of Volatiles, Nature is
obliged to make use of in the Composi∣tion,
are hardly to be avoided, the Disas∣ters
which generally they push the Ani∣mal
into, are as necessarily consequent
to them as Night is to the Setting of the
<HI>Sun;</HI> and these are very many, as disob∣liging
Parents, who have frequently in
this Country whipt their <HI>Sons</HI> for making
Verses; and here I could not but reflect
how useful a Discipline early Correction
must be to a Poet; and how easy the
Town had been had <HI>N</HI>—<HI>t, E</HI>—<HI>w,
T. B</HI>—<HI>P</HI>—<HI>s, D</HI>—<HI>S</HI>—<HI>D</HI>—<HI>fy,</HI>
and an Hundred more of the jingling
Train of our modern Rhymers, been
Whipt young, <HI>very young,</HI> for Poetasting
they had never perhaps suckt in that Ve∣nome
of Ribaldry, which all the Saty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Age has never been able to scourge
out of them to this Day.</P>
<P>The further fatal Consequences of these
unhappy Defects in Nature, where she
has damn'd a Man to Wit and Rhyme,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
has been loss of Inheritance, Parents be∣ing
aggravated by the obstinate young
<HI>Beaus,</HI> resolving to be Wits in spight of
Nature, the wiser Head has been obli∣ged
to Confederate with Nature, and
with-hold the Birth-right of Brains, which
otherwise the young Gentleman might
have enjoy'd, to the great support of his
Family and Posterity. Thus the famous
<HI>Waller, Denham, Dryden,</HI> and sundry O∣thers,
were oblig'd to condemn their Race
to Lunacy and Blockheadism, only to pre∣vent
the fatal Destruction of their Fa∣milies,
and entailing the Plague of Wit
and Weathercocks upon their Posterity.</P>
<P>The yet farther Extravagancies which
naturally attend the Mischief of <HI>Wit,</HI> are
<HI>Beau-ism, Dogmaticality, Whimsification,
Impudensity,</HI> and various kinds of <HI>Foppe∣rosities</HI>
(according to Mr. <HI>Boyl,</HI>) which
issuing out of the Brain, descend into all
the Faculties, and branch themselves by
Infinite Variety, into all the Actions of
Life.</P>
<P>These by Conseqence, Beggar the Head,
the Tail, the Purse, and the whole Man,
till he becomes as poor and despicable as
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Negative Nature can leave him, abandon'd
of his Sense, his Manners, his Modesty,
and what's worse, his Money, having
nothing left but his Poetry, dies in a
Ditch, or a Garret, <HI>A-la-mode de Tom
Brown,</HI> uttering Rhymes and Nonsence
to the last Moment.</P>
<P>In Pity to all my unhappy Brethren,
who suffer under these Inconveniencies,
I cannot but leave it on Record, that
they may not be reproached with being
Agents of their own Misfortunes, since
I assure them, Nature has form'd them
with the very Necessity of acting like
Coxcombs, fixt upon them by the force
of Organick Consequences, and placed
down at the very Original Effusion of
that fatal thing call'd <HI>Wit.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Discovery less wonderful
than edifying, and no humane Art on
our side the World ever found out such a
Sympathetick Influence, between the Ex∣treams
of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Folly,</HI> till this great
Lunarian Naturalist furnisht us with such

Nor is this all I learnt from him, tho'
I cannot part with this, till I have pub∣lisht
a <HI>Memento Mori,</HI> and told 'em what
I had discovered of Nature in these re∣mote
Parts of the World, from whence I
take the Freedom to tell these Gentlemen,
That if they please to Travel to these di∣stant
Parts, and examine this great Ma∣ster
of Nature's Secrets, they may every
Man see what cross Strokes Nature has
struck, to finish and form every extrava∣gant
Species of that Heterogenious Kind
we call <HI>Wit.</HI></P>
<P>There <HI>C</HI>—<HI>S</HI>—may be inform'd how
he comes to be very Witty, and a Mad∣man
all at once; and <HI>P</HI>—<HI>r</HI> may see,
That with less Brains and more <HI>P</HI>—<HI>x</HI> he
is more a Wit and more a Mad-man than the
Coll. <HI>Ad</HI>—son may tell his Master
My Lord—- the reason from Nature,
why he would not take the Court's Word,
nor write the Poem call'd, <HI>The Campaign,</HI>
till he had 200 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> secur'd to
him; since 'tis known they have but one
Author in the Nation that writes for 'em
for nothing, and he is labouring very
hard to obtain the Title of Blockhead,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
and not be paid for it: Here <HI>D.</HI> might
understand, how he came to be able to
banter all Mankind, and yet all Mankind
be able to banter him; at the same time
our numerous throng of <HI>Parnassians</HI> may
see Reasons for the variety of the Negative
and Positive Blessings they enjoy; some for
having Wit and no Verse, some Verse and
no Wit, some Mirth without Jest, soem Jest
without Fore-cast, some Rhyme and no Jin∣gle,
some all Jingle and no Rhyme, some
Language without measure; some all
Quantity and no Cudence, some all Wit
and no Sence, some all Sence and no Flame,
some Preach in Rhyme, some sing when
they Preach, some all Song and no Tune,
some all Tune and no Song; all these Un∣accountables
have their Originals, and can
be answer'd for in unerring Nature, tho'
in our out-side Guesses we can say little
to it. Here is to be seen, why some are
all Nature, some all Art; some beat Verse
out of the Twenty-four rough Letters,
with Ten Hammers and Anvils to every
Line, and maul the Language as a <HI>Swede</HI>
beats Stock-Fish; Others <HI>huff</HI> Nature,

<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
in a black Cloud: Thus Degrees and
Capacities are fitted by Nature, according
to Organick Efficacy; and the Reason
and Nature of Things are found in them∣selves:
Had <HI>D</HI>—<HI>y</HI> seen his own Draft
by this Light of <HI>Chinese</HI> Knowledge, he
might have known he should be a Cox∣comb

<HI>Dryden</HI> might have told his Fate, that
having his extraordinary Genius slung and

turn round as fast as the Times, and in∣struct
him how to write Elegies to <HI>O. C.</HI>

<P>Particularly a Map of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> with
an exact Delineation of all the Cells, A∣partments,

of Thought for the Improvement of all
sorts of humane Understanding, and to
have discoursed with them on those
things, must have been very pleasant, be∣sides,
its being very much to our paritcu∣lar
Advantage.</P>
<P>I confess, I have thought it might have
been very useful to this Nation, to have
brought so wonderful an Invention hither,
and I was once very desirous to have
set up my rest here, and for the Benefit
of my Native Country, have made my
self Master of these Engines, that I might
in due time have convey'd them to our
Royal Society, that once in 40 Years they
might have been said to do something
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Publick Good; and that the Reputa∣sion
and Usefulness of the <HI>so so's</HI> might

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat in the Moon there were many of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Glasses to be had very cheap, and I
having declar'd my Resolution of under∣taking
a Voyage thither, I deferred my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esign, and shall defer my treating of
them, till I give some Account of my

<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
But above all his Inventions for making
this Voyage, I saw none more pleasant
or profitable, than a certain Engine for∣med
in the shape of a Chariot, on the
Backs of two vast Bodies with extended
Wings, which spread about 50 Yards in
Breadth, compos'd of Feathers so nicely
put together, that no Air could pass;
and as the Bodies were made of <HI>Lunar
Earth</HI> which would bear the Fire, the
Cavities were fill'd with an Ambient
Flame, which fed on a certain Spirit depo∣sited
in a proper quantity, to last out the
Voyage; and this Fire so order'd as to move
about such Springs and Wheels as kept
the Wings in a most exact and regular
Motion, always ascendant; thus the Per∣son
being placed in this airy Chariot,
drinks a certain dozing Draught, that
throws him into a gentle Slumber, and
Dreaming all the way, never wakes till
he comes to his Journey's end.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Consolidator.</HEAD>
<P>THese Engines are call'd in their
Country Language, <HI>Dupekasses;</HI>
and according to the Ancient <HI>Chinese,</HI> or
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
<HI>Tartarian, Apezolanthukanistes;</HI> in <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> a <HI>Consolidator.</HI></P>
<P>The Composition of this Engine is very
admirable; for, as is before noted, 'tis
all made up of Feathers, and the quality
of the Feathers, is no less wonderful than
their Composition; and therefore, I hope
the Reader will bear with the Description
for the sake of the Novelty, since I assure
him such things as these are not to be
seen in every Country.</P>
<P>The number of Feathers are just 513,
they are all of a length and breadth ex∣actly,
which is absolutely necessary to the
<HI>floating Figure,</HI> or else one side or any one
part being wider or longer than the rest,
it would interrupt the motion of the
whole Engine; only there is one extra∣ordinary
Feather which, as there is an
odd one in the number, is placed in the
Center, and is the Handle, or rather Rud∣der
to the whole Machine: This Feather
is every way larger than its Fellows, 'tis
almost as long and broad again; but a∣bove
all, its Quill or Head is much lar∣ger,
and it has <HI>as it were</HI> several small
bushing Feathers round the bottom of it,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
which all make but one presiding or su∣perintendent
Feather, to guide, regulate,
and pilot the whole Body.</P>
<P>Nor are these common Feathers, but
they are pickt and cull'd out of all parts
of the Lunar Country, by the Command
of the Prince; and every Province sends
up the best they can find, <HI>or ought to do
so at least,</HI> or else they are very much to
blame; for the Employment they are put
to being of so great use to the Publick,
and the Voyage or Flight so exceeding
high, it would be very ill done if, when
the King sends his Letters about the Na∣tion,
to pick him up the best Feathers
they can lay their Hands on, they should
send weak, decay'd, or half-grown Fea∣thers,
and yet sometimes it happens so;
and once there was such rotten Feathers
collected, whether it was a bad Year for
Feathers, or whether the People that ga∣ther'd
them had a mind to abuse their
King; but the Feathers were so bad, the
Engine was good for nothing, but broke
before it was got half way; and by a
double Misfortune, this happen'd to be
at an unlucky time, when the King him∣self
had resolv'd on a Voyage, or Flight
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
to the <HI>Moon;</HI> but being deceiv'd, by the
unhappy Miscarriage of the deficient Fea∣thers,
he fell down from so great a height,
that he struck himself against his own
Palace, and beat his Head off.</P>
<P>Nor had the Sons of this Prince much
better Success, tho' the first of them was
a Prince mightily belov'd by his Subjects;
but his Misfortunes chiefly proceeded from
his having made use of one of the Engines
so very long, that the Feathers were quite
worn out, and good for nothing: He
used to make a great many Voyages and
Flights into the <HI>Moon,</HI> and then would
make his Subjects give him great Sums of
Money to come down to them again;
and yet they were so fond of him, That
they always complyed with him, and
would give him every thing he askt, ra∣ther
than to be without him: <HI>But they
grew wiser since.</HI></P>
<P>At last, this Prince used his Engine so
long, it could hold together no longer;
and being obliged to write to his Subjects
to pick him out some new Feathers, <HI>they did
so;</HI> but withall sent him such <HI>strong</HI> Fea∣thers,
and so <HI>stiff,</HI> that when he had placed
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
'em in their proper places, and made a very
beautiful Engine, it was <HI>too heavy for him
to manage:</HI> He made a great many Essays
at it, and had it placed on the top of an
old Idol Chappel, dedicated to an old
<HI>Bramyn</HI> Saint of those Countries, called,
<HI>Phantosteinaschap;</HI> in <HI>Latin, chap. de Saint
Stephano;</HI> or in <HI>English,</HI> St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s:
Here the Prince try'd all possible Contri∣vances,
and a vast deal of Money it cost
him; but the Feathers were [<HI>so stiff</HI> they
would not work, and <HI>the Fire within</HI> was
so choaked and smother'd with its <HI>own
Smoak,</HI> for want of due Vent and Circu∣lation,
that it <HI>would not burn;</HI> so he was
oblig'd to take it down again; and from
thence he carried it to his College of <HI>Bra∣myn</HI>
Priests, and set it up in one of their
Publick Buildings: There he drew Cir∣cles
of Ethicks and Politicks, and fell to
casting of Figures and Conjuring, but all
would not do, <HI>the Feathers</HI> could not be
brought to move; and, indeed, I have
observ'd, That these Engines are seldom
helpt by Art and Contrivance; there is
no way with them, but to have the Peo∣ple
spoke to, to get <HI>good Feathers;</HI> and
they are easily placed, and perform all
the several Motions with the greatest Ease
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
and Accuracy imaginable; <HI>but it must be
all Nature;</HI> any thing of Force distorts
and dislocates them, and the whole
Order is spoiled; and if there be but one
Feather out of place, or pincht, or stands
wrong, <HI>the D—l would not ride in the
Chariot.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince thus finding his Labour in
vain, broke the Engine to pieces, and
sent his Subjects Word what bad Feathers
they had sent him: But the People, who
knew it was his own want of Manage∣ment,
and that the Feathers were good
enough, only a little stiff at first, and with
good Usage would have been brought to
be fit for use, took it ill, and never would
send him any other as long as he liv'd:
However, it had this good effect upon
him, That he never made any more Voy∣ages
to the <HI>Moon</HI> as long as he reign'd.</P>
<P>His Brother suceeeded him; and truly
he was resoved upon a Voyage to the
<HI>Moon,</HI> as soon as ever he came to the
Crown. He had met with some unkind
Usage from the Religious <HI>Lunesses</HI> of his
own Country; and be turn'd <HI>Abogratziarian,</HI>
a zealous fiery Sect something like our <HI>Anti-every
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
body-arians</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis confest,
some of the <HI>Bramyns</HI> of his Country were
very false to him, put him upon several
Ways of extending his Power over his
Subjects, contrary to the Customs of the
People, and contrary to his own Inte∣rest;
and when the People expressed
their Dislike of it, he thought to have
been supported by those Clergy-men; but
they failed him, and made good that Old
<HI>English</HI> Verse;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>That Priests of all Religions are the same.</HEAD>
<P>He took this so hainously, that he con∣ceiv'd
a just Hatred against those that had
deceiv'd him; and as Resentments seldom
keep Rules, unhappily entertain'd Preju∣dices
against all the rest; and not finding
it easy to bring all his Designs to pass
better, he resolved upon a Voyage to the
<HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, he sends a Summons to
all his People according to Custom, to
collect the usual quantity of Feathers for
that purpose; and because he would be
sure not be used as his Brother and Fa∣ther
had been, he took care to send cer∣tain
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
Cunning-men Express, all over the
Country, to bespeak the People's Care,
in collecting, picking and culling them out,
these were call'd in their Language, <HI>Tso∣pablesdetoo;</HI>
which being Translated may
signify in <HI>English, Men of Zeal,</HI> or <HI>Booted
Apostles:</HI> Nor was this the only Caution
this Prince used; for he took care, as the
Feathers were sent up to him, to search
and examine them one by one in his own
Closet, to see if they were fit for his pur∣pose;
but, alas! he found himself in his
Brother's Case exactly; and perceived,
That his Subjects were generally disgusted
at his former Conduct, about <HI>Abrogratzi∣anism,</HI>
and such things, and particu∣larly
set in a Flame by some of their
Priests, call'd, <HI>Dullobardians,</HI> or <HI>Passive-Obedience-men,</HI>
who had lately turn'd their
Tale, and their Tail too upon their own
Princes; and upon this, be laid aside any
more Thoughts of the Engine, but took
up a desperate and implacable Resolution,
<HI>viz.</HI> to fly up to the Moon without it; in
order to this, abundance of his Cunning∣men
were summon'd together to assist
him, strange Engines contriv'd, and Me∣thods
prpos'd; and a great many came
from all Parts, to furnish him with In∣ventions
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
and equivalent for their Jour∣ney;
but all were so preposterous and ri∣diculous
that his Subjects seeing him going
on to ruin himself, and by Consequence
them too, unanimously took Arms; and
if their Prince had not made his Escape
into a foreign Country, 'tis thought they
would have secur'd him <HI>for a Mad-man.</HI></P>
<P>And here 'tis observable, That as it is
in most such Cases, the mad Councellors
of this Prince, when the People begun to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gather
about him, fleds; and every one
shifted for themselves; nay, and some
of them plunder'd him first of his Jewels
and Treasure, and never were heard of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
since.</P>
<P>From this Prince none of the Kings o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Government of that Country have ever
seem'd to incline to the hazardous At∣tempt
of the Voyage to the <HI>Moon,</HI> at least
not in such a hair-brain'd manner.</P>
<P>However, the Engine has been very
accurately Re-built and finish'd; and the
People are now oblig'd by a Law, to send
up new Feathers every three Years, to
prevent the Mischiefs which happen'd by
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
that Prince aforesaid, keeping one Set so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong that it was dangerous to venture
with them; and thus the Engine is pre∣served
fit for use.</P>
<P>And yet has not this Engine been with∣out
its continual Disasters, and often out
of repair; for though the Kings of the
Country, as has been Noted, have done
riding on the back of it, yet the <HI>restless</HI>
Courtiers and Ministers of State have fre∣quently
obtained the Management of it,
from the too easy Goodness of their Ma∣sters,
or the Evils of the Times.</P>
<P>To Cure this, the Princes frequently
chang'd Hands, turn'd one Set of Men out
and put another in: But this made things
still worse; for it divided the People into
Parties and Factions in the State, and still
the Strife was, who should ride in this
Engine; and no sooner were these <HI>Skaet-Riders</HI>
got into it, but they were for <HI>dri∣ving
all the Nation up to the</HI> Moon: But of
this by it self.</P>
<P>Authors differ concerning the Original
of these Feathers, and by what most exact
Hand they were first appointed to this
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
particular use; and as their Original
hard to be found, so it seems a Difficulty
to resolve from what sort of Bird these
Feathers are obtained: Some have nam'd
one, some another; but the most Learn∣ed
in those Climates call it by a hard
Word, which the Printer having no Let∣ters
to express, and being in that place
Hierogliphical, I can translate no better
than by the Name of a <HI>Collective:</HI> This
must be a strange Bird without doubt; it
has Heads, Claws, Eyes and Teeth innu∣merable;
and if I should go about to de∣scribe
it to you, the History would be so
Romantick, it would spoil the Credit of
these more Authentick Relations which
are yet behind.</P>
<P>'Tis sufficient, therefore, for the pre∣sent,
only to leave you this short Abridge∣ment
of the Story, as follows: This great
Monstrous Bird, call'd the <HI>Collective,</HI> is
very seldom seen, and indeed never, but
upon <HI>Great Revolutions,</HI> and portending
terrible Desolations and Destructions to
a Country.</P>
<P>But he frequently sheds his Feathers;
and they are carefully pickt up, by the
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
<HI>Proprietors</HI> of those Lands where they
fall; for <HI>none but those Proprietors may</HI>
meddle with them; and they no sooner
pick them up but they are sent to Court,
where they obtain a new Name, and are
called in a Word equally difficult to pro∣nounce
as the other, but very like our
<HI>English</HI> Word, <HI>Representative;</HI> and being
placed in their proper Rows, with the
<HI>Great Feather</HI> in the Center, and fitted for
use, they lately obtained the Venerable
Title of, <HI>The Consolidators;</HI> and the Ma∣chine
it self, the <HI>Consolidator;</HI> and by that
Name the Reader is desir'd for the future
to let it be dignified and distinguish'd.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, forbear to descant a
little here, on the Dignity and Beauty
of these Feathers, being such as are hard∣ly
to be seen in any part of the World,
but just in these remote Climates.</P>
<P>And First, Every Feather has various
Colours, and according to the Variety of
the Weather, are apt to look brighter and
clearer, or paler and fainter, as the <HI>Sun</HI>
happens to look on them with a stronger
or weaker Aspect. The Quill or Head of
every Feather is <HI>or ought to be</HI> full of a
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
vigorous Substance, which gives Spirit
and supports the brightness and colour of
the Feather; and as this is more or less in
quantity, the bright Colour of the Feather
is increased, or turns languid and pale.</P>
<P>'Tis true, some of those Quills are ex∣ceeding
empty and dry; and the Humid
being totally exhal'd, those Feathers grow
very useless and insignificant in a short
time.</P>
<P>Some again are so full of Wind, and
puft up with the Vapour of the Climate,
that there's not Humid enough to Con∣dence
the Steam; and these are so fleet
so light, and so continually fluttering and
troublesome, that they greatly serve to
disturb and keep the Motion unsteddy.</P>
<P>Others either placed too near the in∣ward
concealed Fire, or the Head of the
Quill being thin, the Fire causes too
great a Fermentation; and the Conse∣quence
of this is so fatal, that sometimes
it mounts the Engine up too fast, and in∣dangers
Precipitation: But 'tis happily
observed, That these ill Feathers are but
a very few, compar'd to the whole num∣ber;
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
at the most, I never heard they
were above 134 of the whole number:
As for the empty ones, they are not very
dangerous, but a sort of <HI>Good-for-nothing
Feathers,</HI> that will fly when the greatest
number of the rest fly, or stand still when
they stand still. The fluttering hot-head∣ed
Feathers ate the most dangerous, and
frequently struggle hard to mount the En∣gine
to extravagant heights; but still the
greater number of the Feathers being
stanch, and well fixt, as well as well fur∣nisht,
they always prevail, and check the
Disorders the other would bring upon the
Motion; so that upon the whole Matter,
tho' there has sometims been oblique Mo∣tions,
Variations, and sometimes great
Wandrings out of the way, which may
make the Passage tedious, yet it has always
been a certain and safe Voyage; and no
Engine was ever known to miscarry or
overthrow, but that one mentioned before,
and that was very much owing to the pre∣cipitate
Methods the Prince took in gui∣ding
it; and tho' all the fault was laid in
the Feathers, <HI>and they were to blame e∣nough,</HI>
yet I never heard any Wise Man,
but what blam'd his Discretion, and par∣ticularly,
a certain great Man has wrote
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
three large Tracts of those Affairs, and
call'd them, <HI>The History of the Opposition of the
Feathers;</HI> wherein, tho' it was expected
he would have curst the Engine it self
and all the Feathers to the Devil, on the
contrary, he lays equal blame on the
Prince, who guided the Chariot with so
unsteddy a Hand, now as much too slack,
as then too hard, turning them this way
and that so hastily, that the Feathers could
not move in their proper order; and this
at last put the Fire in the Center quite
out, and so the Engine over-set at once.
This Impartiality has done great Justice
to the Feathers, and set things in a clearer
light: But of this I shall say more, when
I come to treat of the <HI>Works of the Learn∣ed</HI>
in this Lunar World.</P>
<P>This is hinted here only to inform the
Reader, That this Engine is the safest
Passage that ever was found out; and
that saving that one time, it never mis∣carried;
nor if the common Order of
things be observed, cannot Miscarry; for
the good Feathers are always <HI>Negatives</HI>
when any precipitant Motion is felt, and
immediately suppress it by their number;
and these <HI>Negative Feathers</HI> are indeed the
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
Travellers safety; the other are always
upon the flutter, and upon every occasion
<HI>hey for the Moon,</HI> up in the Clouds pre∣sently;
but these <HI>Negative Feathers</HI> are
never for going up, but when there is
occasion for it; and from hence these
fluttering fermented Feathers were called
by the Antients <HI>High-flying Feathers,</HI> and
the blustering things seem'd proud of the
Name.</P>
<P>But to come to their general Character,
the Feathers, speaking of them all toge∣ther,
are generally very Comely, Strong,
Large, Beautiful things, their Quills or
Heads well fixt, and the Cavities fill'd
with a solid substantial Matter, which
tho' it is full of Spirit, has a great deal of
Temperament, and full of suitable well-dispos'd
Powers, to the Operation for
which they are design'd.</P>
<P>These placed, as I Noted before, in an
extended Form like two great Wings, and
operated by that sublime Flame; which
being concealed in proper Receptacles,
obtains its vent at the Cavities appointed,
are supplied from thence with Life and
Motion; and as Fire it self, in the Opi∣nion
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
of some Learned Men, is nothing but
Motion, and Motion tends to Fire: It
can no more be a Wonder, if exalted in
the Center of this famous Engine, a whole
Nation should be carried up to the World
in the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, this Engine is frequently as∣saulted
with fierce Winds, and furious
Storms, which sometimes drive it a great
way out of its way; and indeed, consi∣dering
the length of the Passage, and the
various Regions it goes through, it would
be strange if it should meet with no Ob∣structions:
These are oblique Gales, and
cannot be said to blow from any of the
Thirty-two Points, bnt Retrograde and
Thwart: Some of these are call'd in their
Language, <HI>Pensionazima,</HI> which is as much
as to say, being Interpreted, a <HI>Court-breeze;</HI>
another sort of Wind, which generally
blows directly contrary to the <HI>Pensionazi∣ma,</HI>
is the <HI>Clamorio,</HI> or in <HI>English,</HI> a <HI>Coun∣try
Gale;</HI> this is generally Tempestuous,
full of Gusts and Disgusts, Squauls and
sudden Blasts, not without claps of Thun∣der,
and not a little flashing of Heat and
Party-fires.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
There are a great many other Internal
Blasts, which proceed from the Fire with∣in,
which sometimes not circulating right,
breaks out in little Gusts of Wind and
Heat, and is apt to indanger setting
Fire to the Feathers, and this is more
or less dangerous, according as among
which of the Feathers it happens; for
some of the Feathers are more apt to take
Fire than others, as their Quills or Heads
are more or less full of that solid Matter
mention'd before.</P>
<P>The Engine suffers frequent Convulsi∣ons
and Disorders from these several
Winds; and which if they chance to
overblow very much, hinder the Passage;
but the Negative Feathers always apply
Temper and Moderation; and this brings
all to rights again.</P>
<P>For a Body like this, what can it not
do? what cannot such an Extension per∣form
in the Air? And when one thing is
tackt to another, and properly <HI>Cosolidated</HI>
into one mighty <HI>Consolidator,</HI> no question
but whoever shall go up to the <HI>Moon,</HI> will
find himself so improv'd in this wonder∣ful
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Experiment, that not a Man ever per∣form'd
that wonderful Flight, but he cer∣tainly
came back again as wise as he
went.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, and what if we are
call'd <HI>High-flyers</HI> now, and an Hundred
Names of Contempt and Distinction,
what is this to the purpose? who would
not be a <HI>High-flyer,</HI> to be Tackt and <HI>Con∣solidated</HI>
in an Engine of such sublime
Elevation, and which lifts Men, Monarchs,
Members, yea, and whole Nations, up
into the Clouds; and performs with such
wondrous Art, the long expected Experi∣ment
of a Voyage to the <HI>Moon?</HI> And
thus much for the Description of the <HI>Con∣solidator.</HI></P>
<P>The first Voyage I ever made to this
Country, was in one of these Engines;
and I can safely affirm, I never wak'd all
the way; and now having been as often
there as most that have us'd that Trade,
it may be expected I should give some
Account of the Country; for it appears▪
I can give but little of the Road.</P>
<P>Only this I understand, That when this
Engine, by help of these Artificial Wings
has raised it self up to a certain height
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
the Wings are as useful to keep it from
falling into the <HI>Moon,</HI> as they were before
to raise it, and keep it from falling back
into this Region again.</P>
<P>This may happen from an Alteration of
Centers, and Gravity having past a cer∣tain
Line, the Equipoise changes its Ten∣dency,
the Magnetick Quality being be∣yond
it, it inclines of Course, and pur∣sues
a Center, which it finds in the <HI>Lunar
World,</HI> and lands us safe upon the Sur∣face.</P>
<P>I was told, I need take no Bills of Ex∣change
with me, nor Letters of Credit;
for that upon my first Arrival, the Inha∣bitants
would be very civil to me: That
they never suffered any of <HI>Our World</HI> to
want any thing when they came there:
That they were very free to show them
any thing, and inform them in all need∣ful
Cases; and that whatever Rarities the
Country afforded, should be expos'd im∣mediately.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into the Customs, Geo∣graphy,
or History of the Place, only
acquaint the Reader, That I found no
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
manner of Difference in any thing Natu∣ral,
except as hereafter excepted, but all
was exactly as is here, an Elementary
World, peopled with Folks, <HI>as like us as</HI>
if they were only Inhabitants of the same
Continent, but in a remote Climate.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants were <HI>Men, Women,
Beasts, Birds, Fishes,</HI> and <HI>Insects,</HI> of the
same individual Species as Ours, the lat∣ter
excepted: The <HI>Men</HI> no wiser, better,
nor bigger than here; the <HI>Women</HI> no
handsomer or honester than Ours: There
were Knaves and honest Men, honest Wo∣men
and Whores of all Sorts, Countries,
Nations and Kindreds, as on this side the
Skies.</P>
<P>They had the same Sun to shine, the
Planets were equally visible <HI>as to us,</HI> and
<HI>their Astrologers</HI> were as busily Impertinent
as Ours, only that those wonderful Glas∣ses
hinted before made strange Discove∣ries
that we were unacquainted with; by
them they could, plainly discover, That
<HI>this</HI> World was <HI>their</HI> Moon, and <HI>their</HI>
World <HI>our</HI> Moon; and when I came first
among them, the People that flockt about
me, distinguisht me by the Name of, <HI>the
Man that came out of the Moon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
I cannot, however, but acquaint the
Reader, with some Remarks I made in
this new World, before I come to any
thing Historical.</P>
<P>I have heard, that among the General∣lity
of our People, who being not much
addicted to Revelation, have much con∣cern'd
themselves about Demonstrations,
a Generation have risen up, who to solve
the Difficulties of Supernatural Systems,
imagine <HI>a mighty vast Something,</HI> who has
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Form but what represents him to them
as one <HI>Great Eye:</HI> This infinite Optick
they imagine to be <HI>Natura Naturans,</HI> or
Power-forming; and that as we pretend
the Soul of Man has a Similitude in quali∣ty
to its Original, according to a Notion
some People have, who read that so much
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idicul'd Old Legend, call'd <HI>Bible,</HI> That
<HI>Man was made in the Image of his Maker:</HI>
The Soul of Man, therefore, in the Opi∣nion
of these Naturallists, is <HI>one vast Op∣tick
Power</HI> diffus'd through him into all
his Parts, but seated principally in his
Head.</P>
<P>From hence they resolve all Beings to
<HI>Eyes,</HI> some more capable of Sight and re∣ceptive
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
of Objects than others; and as to
things Invisible, they reckon nothing so,
only so far as our Sight is deficient, con∣tracted
or darkened by Accidents from
without, as Distance of Place, Interposi∣tion
of Vapours, Clouds, liquid Air, Ex∣halations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or from within, <HI>as wan∣dring
Errors, wild Notions, cloudy Ʋnder∣standings,</HI>
and <HI>empty Fancies,</HI> with a Thou∣sand
other interposing Obstacles to the
Sight, which darken it, and prevent its
Operation; and particularly obstruct the
perceptive Faculties, weaken the Head,
and bring Mankind in General to stand in
need of the <HI>Spectacles of Education</HI> as soon
ever they are born: Nay, and as soon
as they have made use of these Artificial
Eyes, all they can do is but to clear the
Sight so far as <HI>to see</HI> that <HI>they can't see;</HI> the
utmost Wisdom of Mankind, and the
highest Improvement a Man ought to wish
for, being but to be able to see that <HI>he was
Born blind;</HI> this pushes him upon search
after Mediums for the Recovery of his
Sight, and <HI>away he runs to School</HI> to Art
and Science, and there he is furnisht with
<HI>Hocoscopes, Microscopes, Tellescopes, Caelis∣copes,
Money-scopes,</HI> and the D—l and
and all of Glasses, to help and assist his
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
<HI>Moon-blind Ʋnderstanding;</HI> these with
wonderful Skill and Ages of Application,
after wandring thro' Bogs and Wildernes∣ses
of <HI>Guess, Conjectures, Supposes, Calcu∣lations,</HI>
and he knows riot what, which he
meets with in <HI>Physicks, Politicks, Ethicks,
Astronomy, Malthematicks,</HI> and such sort
of bewildring Things, bring him with
vast Difficulty to a little Minute-spot,
call'd <HI>Demonstration;</HI> and as not one in
Ten Thousand ever finds the way thither,
but are lost in the tiresome uncouth Jour∣ney,
sa they <HI>that do,</HI> 'tis so long before
they come there, that they are grown
Old and good for little in the Journey;
and no sooner have they obtained a gli∣mering
of this Universal <HI>Eye-sight,</HI> this
<HI>Eclaricissment General,</HI> but they <HI>Die,</HI> and
have hardly time to show the way to
those that come after.</P>
<P>Now, as the earnest search after this
thing call'd <HI>Demonstration</HI> fill'd me with
Desires of seeing every thing, so my Ob∣servations
of the strange multitude of Mys∣teries
I met with in all Men's Actions here,
spurr'd my Curiosity to examine, if <HI>the
Great Eye</HI> of the World had no People to
whom he had given a clearer Eye-sight,
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
or at least, that made a better use of it
than we had here.</P>
<P>If pursuing this search I was much de∣lighted
at my Arrival into <HI>China,</HI> it can∣not
be thought strange, since there we
find Knowledge as much advanc'd beyond
our common Pitch, as it was pretended
to be deriv'd from a more Ancient Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>We are told, that in the early Age of
the World, the Strength of Invention ex∣ceded
all that ever has been arrived to
since: That we in these latter Ages, ha∣ving
lost all that pristine Strength of Rea∣son
and Invention, which died with the
Ancients in the Flood, and receiving no
helps from that Age, have by long Search
arriv'd at several remote Parts of Know∣ledge,
by the helps of reading Conversa∣tion
and Experience; but that all amounts
to no more than faint Imitations, Apings,
and Resemblances of what was known in
those masterly Ages.</P>
<P>Now, if it be true as is hinted before,
That the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empire was Peopled long
before the Flood; and that they were
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
not destroyed in the General Deluge in
the Days of <HI>Noah;</HI> 'tis no such strange
thing, that they should so much out-do us
in this sort of <HI>Eye-sight</HI> we call <HI>General
Knowledge,</HI> since the Perfections bestow'd
on Nature, when in her Youth and Prime
met with no General Suffocation by that
Calamity.</P>
<P>But if I was extreamly delighted with
the extraordinary things I saw in those
Countries, you cannot but imagine I was
exceedingly mov'd, when I heard of a
<HI>Lunar</HI> World; and that the way was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assable from these Parts.</P>
<P>I had heard of a <HI>World in the moon</HI>
among some of our Learned Philosophers,
and <HI>Moor,</HI> as I have been told, had <HI>a Moon</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his Head; but none of the fine Preten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers,
no not Bishop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> ever found
Mechanick Engines, whose Motion was
sufficient to attempt the Passage. A late
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appy Author indeed, among his Mecha∣nick
Operations of the Spirit, had found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut an Enthusiasm, which if he could have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursued to its proper Extream, without

hereabout; but that he form'd his System
wholly upon the mistaken Notion of <HI>Wind,</HI>
which Learned Hypothesis being directly
contrary to the Nature of things in this
Climate, where the <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the Air
is quite different, and where the <HI>pressure
of the Atmosphere</HI> has for want of Vapour
no Force, all his Notion dissolv'd in its
Native Vapour call'd <HI>Wind,</HI> and flew up∣ward
in blew Strakes of a livid Flame
call'd <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> which burnt up all the
Wit and Fancy of the Author, and left a
strange <HI>stench</HI> behind it, that has this un∣happy
quality in it, that every Body that
Reads the Book, <HI>smells the Auther,</HI> tho'
he be never so far off; nay, tho' he took
Shipping to <HI>Dublin,</HI> to secure his Friends
from the least danger of a Conjecture.</P>
<P>But to return to the happy Regions of
the <HI>Lunar Continent,</HI> I was no sooner
Landed there, and had lookt about me,
but I was surpriz'd with the strange Alte∣ration
of the Climate and Country; and
particularly a strange Salubrity and Fra∣grancy
in the Air, which I felt so Nou∣rishing,
so Pleasant and Delightful, that
tho' I could perceive some small Respira∣tion,
it was hardly discernable, and the
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
least requisite for Life, supplied so long
that the Bellows of Nature were hardly
imployed.</P>
<P>But as I shall take occasion to consider
this in a Critical Examination into the
Nature, Uses and Advantages of <HI>Good
Lungs,</HI> of which by it self, so I think fit
to confine my present Observations to
things more particularly concerning the
<HI>Eye-sight.</HI></P>
<P>I was, you may be sure, not a little
surprized, when being upon an Eminence
I found my self capable by common Ob∣servation,
to see and distinguish things at
the distance of 100 Miles and more, and
seeking some Information on this point,
I was acquainted by the People, that
there was <HI>a certain grave Philosopher</HI> hard
by, that could give me a very good Ac∣count
of things.</P>
<P>It is not worth while to tell you this
Man's <HI>Lunar Name,</HI> or whether he had a
Name, or no; 'tis plain, 'twas a <HI>Man in
the Moon;</HI> but all the Conference I had
with him was very strange: At my first
coming to him, he askt me if I came from
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
the <HI>World in the Moon?</HI> I told him, <HI>no:</HI>
At which he began to be angry, told me
<HI>I Ly'd,</HI> he knew whence I came as well
as I did; for he saw me all the way. I
told him, I came <HI>to the World in the Moon,</HI>
and began to be as surly as he. It was a
long time before we could agree about it,
he would have it, that I came down from
<HI>the Moon;</HI> and I, that I came <HI>up to the
Moon:</HI> From this, we came to Explica∣tions,
Demonstrations, Spheres, Globes,
Regions, Atmospheres, and a Thousand
odd Diagrams, to make the thing out to
one another. I insisted on my part, as
that my Experiment qualified me to know,
and challeng'd him to <HI>go back with me</HI> to
prove it. He, like a true Philosopher,
raised a Thousand Scruples, Conjectures,
and Spherical Problems, to Confront me;
and as for Demonstrations, he call'd 'em
Fancies of my own. Thus we differ'd a
great many ways; both of us were cer∣tain,
and both uncertain; both right,
and yet both directly contrary; how to
reconcile this Jangle was very hard, till
at last this Demonstration happen'd, the
Moon as he call'd it, turning her blind∣side
upon us three Days after the Change,
by which, with the help of his extraor∣dinary
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
Glasses, I that knew the Country,
perceived that side the <HI>Sun</HI> lookt upon was
<HI>all Moon,</HI> and the other was <HI>all World;</HI>
and either I fancy'd I saw or else really
saw all the lofty Towers of the Immense
Cities of <HI>China:</HI> Upon this, and a little
more Debate, we came to this Conclusi∣on,
and there the Old Man and I agreed,
That they were <HI>both Moons</HI> and <HI>both Worlds,</HI>
this <HI>a Moon</HI> to that, and that <HI>a Moon</HI> to
this, like the Sun between two Looking-Glasses,
and shone upon one another by
Reflection, according to the oblique or
direct Position of each other.</P>
<P>This afforded us a great deal of Plea∣sure;
for all the World covet to be found
in the right, and are pleas'd when their
Notions are acknowledg'd by their Anta∣gonists:
It also afforded us many very
useful Speculations, such as these;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How easy it is for Men to <HI>fall out,</HI>
and yet all sides to be in the <HI>right?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How Natural it is for <HI>Opinion</HI> to
despise <HI>Demonstration?</HI></ITEM>
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
<ITEM>3. How proper mutual <HI>Enquiry</HI> is to
mutual <HI>Satisfaction?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From the Observation of these Glasses,
we also drew some <HI>Puns, Crotchets</HI> and
<HI>Conclusions.</HI></P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> That the whole World has a <HI>Blind∣side,</HI>
a <HI>Dark-side,</HI> and a <HI>Bright-side,</HI> and
consequently so has every Body in it.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> That the <HI>Dark-side</HI> of Affairs <HI>to
Day,</HI> be the <HI>Bright-side to Morrow;</HI>
from whence abundance of useful Morals
were also raised; such as,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. No Man's Fate is so dark, but when
the <HI>Sun</HI> shines upon it, it will return its
Rays, and shine for it self.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. All things turn like the <HI>Moon, up</HI> to
Day, <HI>down</HI> to Morrow, <HI>Full</HI> and <HI>Change,
Flux</HI> and <HI>Reflux.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Humane Understanding is like the
<HI>Moon</HI> at the First Quarter, <HI>half dark.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69"/>
3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Changing-sides</HI> ought not to
be thought so strange, or so much Con∣demn'd
by Mankind, having its Original
from the <HI>Lunar Influence,</HI> and govern'd
by the Powerful Operation of Heavenly
Motion.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> If there be any such thing as
Destiny in the World, I know nothing
Man is so predestinated to, as to be eter∣nally
turning round; and but that I pur∣pose
to entertain the Reader with at least
a whole Chapter or Section of the Philo∣sophy
of <HI>Humane Motion,</HI> Spherically and
<HI>Hypocritically Examin'd</HI> and <HI>Calculated,</HI> I
should inlarge upon that Thought in this
place.</P>
<P>Having thus jumpt in our Opinions▪
and perfectly satisfied ourselves with De∣monstration,
That these Worlds were
Sisters, both in Form, Function, and all
their Capacities; in short, a pair of <HI>Moons,</HI>
and a pair of <HI>Worlds,</HI> equally Magnetical,
Sympathetical, and Influential, we set up
our rest as to that Affair, and went for∣ward.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
I desir'd no better Acquaintance in my
new Travels, than this new Sociate; ne∣ver
was there such a Couple of People
met; he was the <HI>Man in the Moon</HI> to me,
and I <HI>the Man in the Moon</HI> to him; he
wrote down all I said, and made a Book
of it, and call'd it, <HI>News from the World
in the</HI> Moon; and all the Town is like to
see <HI>my Minutes</HI> under the same Title;
nay, and I have been told, he published
some such bold Truths there, from the
Allegorical Relations he had of me from
our World: That he was call'd before
the Publick Authority, who could not
bear the just Reflections of his <HI>damn'd Sa∣tyrical
way of Writing;</HI> and there they pu∣nisht
the Poor Man, put him in Prison,
ruin'd his Family; and not only Fin'd
him <HI>Ʋltra tenementum,</HI> but expos'd him
in the <HI>high Places of their Capital City,</HI> for
the Mob to laugh at him for a Fool: This
is a Punishment not unlike <HI>our Pillory,</HI> and
was appointed for <HI>mean Criminals,</HI> Fellows
that Cheat and Couzen people, Forge
Writings, Forswear themselves, and the
Like; and the People, that it was expect∣ed
would have treated this Man very ill,
on the contrary <HI>Pitied him,</HI> wisht those
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
that set him there placed in his room, and
exprest their Affections, by <HI>loud Shouts</HI> and
Acclamations, when he was taken down.</P>
<P>But as this happen'd before my first Vi∣sit
to that World, when I came there all
was over with him, his particular Ene∣mies
were disgrac'd and turn'd out, and
the Man was not at all the worse receiv'd
by his Country-folks than he was before;
and so much for the <HI>Man in the</HI> Moon.</P>
<P>After we had settled the Debate be∣tween
us, about the Nature and Quality,
I desir'd him to show me some Plan or
Draft of <HI>this new World</HI> of his; upon
which, he brought me out a pair of very
beautiful Globes, and there I had an im∣mediate
Geographical Description of the
Place.</P>
<P>I found it less by Degrees than Our
<HI>Terrestiial Globe,</HI> but more Land and less
Water; and as I was particularly con∣cer'ed
to see something in or near the
same Climate with Our selves, I observ'd
a large extended Country to the North,
about the Latitude of 50 to 56 Northern
Distance; and enquiring of that Country,
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
he told me it was one of the best Coun∣tries
in all their World: That it was his
Native Climate, and he was just a going
to it, and would take me with him.</P>
<P>He told me in General, the Country
was Good, Wholsome, Fruitful, rarely
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cituate for Trade, extraordinarily Ac∣comnaodated
with Harbours, Rivers and
Bays for Shipping; full of Inhabitants;
for it had been Peopled from all Parts,
and had in it some of the Blood of all the
Nations in the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>He told me, as the Inhabitants were
the most Numerous, so they were the
strangest People that liv'd; both their
Natures, Tempers, Qualities, Actions,
and way of Living, was made up of innu∣merable
Contradictions: That they were
the <HI>Wisest</HI> Fools, and the <HI>Foolishest</HI> Wise
Men in the World; the <HI>Weakest Strongest,
Richest Poorest,</HI> most <HI>Generous</HI> Covetous,
<HI>Bold</HI> Cowardly, <HI>False Faithful, Sober</HI>
Dissolute, <HI>Surly</HI> Civil, <HI>Slotbful</HI> Diligent,
<HI>Peaceable</HI> Quarrelling, <HI>Loyal</HI> Seditious Na∣tion
that ever was known.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73"/>
Besides my observations which I made
my self, and which could only furnish me
with what was present, and which I shall
take time to inform my Reader with as
much Care and Conciseness as possible; I
was beholding to this Old <HI>Lunarian,</HI> for
every thing that was Historical or Parti∣cular.</P>
<P>And First, He inform'd me, That in
this new Country they had very seldom
any Clouds at all, and consequently no
extraordinary Storms, but a constant Se∣renity,
moderate Breezes cooled the Air,
and constant Evening Exhalations kept
the Earth moist and fruitful; and as the
Winds they had were various and strong
enough to assist their Navigation, so they
were without the Terrors, Dangers, Ship∣wrecks
and Destructions, which he knew
we were troubled with in this our <HI>Lunar</HI>
World, as he call'd it.</P>
<P>The first just Observation I made of this
was, That I suppos'd from hence the won∣derful
Clearness of the Air, and the Ad∣vantage
of so vast Optick Capacities they
enjoy'd, was obtained: <HI>Alas!</HI> says the
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
<HI>Old Fellow,</HI> You see nothing to what some
of our <HI>Great Eyes</HI> see in some Parts of this
World, nor do you see any thing compar'd to
what you may see by the help of some new In∣vented
Glasses, of which I may in time let
you see the Experiment; and perhaps you may
find this to be the reason why we do not so
abound in Books as in your <HI>Lunar World;</HI>
and that except it be some extraordinary
<HI>Translations</HI> out of your Country, you will
find but little in our Libraries, worth giv∣ing
you a great deal of Trouble.</P>
<P>We immediately quitted the Philoso∣phical
Discourse of Winds, and I began
to be mighty Inquisitive after these Glas∣ses
and Translations, and</P>
<P>1st, Iunderstood here was a strange sort
of Glass that did not so much bring
to the Eye, as by I know not what won∣derful
Operation carried out the Eye to
the Object, and quite varies from all our
Doctrine of Opticks, by forming several
strange <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in Sight, which we are
utterly unacquainted with; nor could
<HI>Vision, Rarification,</HI> or any of our School∣mens
fine Terms, stand me in any stead
in this case; but here was such Additions
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
of <HI>piercing Organs,</HI> Particles of <HI>Transpa∣rence,
Emission, Transtmission, Mediums,</HI>
Contraction of <HI>Rays,</HI> and a Thousand
Applications of things prepar'd for the
wondrous Operation, that you may be
sure are requisite for the bringing to pass
something yet unheard of on this side the
<HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>First we were inform'd, by the help of
these Glasses, strange things, which pass
in our World for Non-Entities, is to
be seen, and very Perceptible; for Ex∣ample:</P>
<P><HI>State Polity,</HI> in all its Meanders, Shifts,
Turns, Tricks, and Contraries, are so
exactly Delineated and Describ'd, That
they are in hopes in time to draw a pair
of Globes out, to bring all those things
to a certainty.</P>
<P>Not but that it made some Puzzle, even
among these Clear-sighted Nations, to
determine what <HI>Figure</HI> the Plans and
Drafts of this undiscover'd <HI>World of Myste∣ries</HI>
ought to be describ'd in: Some were
of Opinion, it ought to be an <HI>Irregular
Centagon,</HI> a Figure with an Hundred <HI>Cones</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
or Angles: Since the <HI>Ʋnaccountables</HI> of
this State-Science, are hid in a Million of
<HI>undiscover'd Corners;</HI> as the Craft, Sub∣tilty
and Hypocrisy of Knaves and Cour∣tiers
have concealed them, never to be
found out, but by this wonderful D—l-<HI>scope,</HI>
which seem'd to threaten a perfect
Discovery of all those <HI>Nudities,</HI> which
have lain hid in the Embrio, and false
Conceptions of <HI>Abortive Policy,</HI> ever since
the Foundation of the World.</P>
<P>Some were of Opinion, this Plan ought
to be Circular, and in a Globular Form,
since it was on all sides alike, full of <HI>dark
Spots,</HI> untrod Mazes, <HI>waking Mischiefs,</HI> and
sleeping Mysteries; and being delineated
like the Globes display'd, would discover
all the Lines of Wickedness to the Eye at
one view: Besides, they fancied some sort
of Analogy in the Rotundity of the Fi∣gure,
with the continued Circular Motion
of all Court-Policies, in the stated Round
of Universal Knavery.</P>
<P>Others would have had it <HI>Hyrogliphical</HI>
as by a <HI>Hand in Hand,</HI> the Form repre∣senting
the Affinity between <HI>State Policy</HI>
here, and <HI>State Policy</HI> in the Infernal Re∣gions,
with some unkind Similies between
the Oeconomy of Satan's Kingdom, and
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
those of most of the Temporal Powers on
Earth; but this was thought too unkind.
At last it was determin'd, That neither
of these Schemes were capable of the vast
Description; and that, therefore, the
Drafts must be made single, tho' not di∣viding
the Governments, yet dividing
the Arts of Governing into proper di∣stinct
Schemes, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. A particular Plan of <HI>Publick Faith;</HI>
and here we had the Experiment immediately
made: The Representation is qualli∣fied
for the Meridian of any <HI>Country,</HI> as well
in <HI>our World</HI> as <HI>theirs;</HI> and turning it to'ards
<HI>our own World,</HI> there I saw plainly an <HI>Ex∣chequer
shut up,</HI> and 20000 Mourning Fa∣milies
selling their <HI>Coaches, Horses, Whores,
Equipages,</HI> &amp;c, for Bread, the Govern∣ment
standing by laughing, and looking
on: Hard by I saw the <HI>Chamber</HI> of a great
City shut up, and Forty Thousand <HI>Or∣phans</HI>
turn'd a-drift in the World; some
had no <HI>Cloaths,</HI> some no <HI>Shoes,</HI> some no
<HI>Money;</HI> and still the City Magistrates
calling upon other Orphans, to <HI>pay their
Money in.</HI> These things put me in mind
of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> and methoughts
I heard the same Voice that spoke to him,
calling me, and telling me, <HI>Come hither,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
aud I'll show thee greater Abominations than
these:</HI> So looking still on that vast Map,
by the help of these Magnifying-Glasses,
I saw <HI>huge Fleets hir'd for Transport-Ser∣vice,
but never paid;</HI> vast Taxes <HI>Antici∣pated,</HI>
that were never Collected;
others Collected and <HI>Appropriated,</HI> but
Misapplied: Millions of <HI>Talleys</HI> struck to
be Discounted, and the Poor paying 40
<HI>per Cent,</HI> to receive their Money. I saw
huge Quantities of Money <HI>drawn in,</HI> and
little or none <HI>issued out;</HI> vast Prizes taken
<HI>from the Enemy,</HI> and then taken away a∣gain
at home by <HI>Friends;</HI> Ships <HI>sav'd</HI> on
the Sea, and sunk in the <HI>Prize Offices;</HI>
Merchants <HI>escaping</HI> from Enemies at Sea,
and be <HI>Pirated</HI> by <HI>Sham Embargoes, Coun∣terfeit
Claims, Confiscations,</HI> &amp;c a-shoar:
There we saw <HI>Turkey-Fleets</HI> taken into
Convoys, and Guarded to the very
Mouth of the Enemy, and then <HI>abandon'd
for their better Security:</HI> Here we saw
Mons. <HI>Pauchartrain</HI> shutting up the Town-house
of <HI>Paris,</HI> and plundring the Bank
of <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>2. Here we saw the State of the War
among Nations; Here was the <HI>French</HI>
giving Sham-thanks for Victories they
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
never got, and some body else adressing
and congratulating <HI>the sublime Glory of
running away:</HI> Here was <HI>Te Deum</HI> for
Sham-Victories by Land; and there was
Thanksgiving for <HI>Ditto by Sea:</HI> Here we
might see two Armies fight, both run a∣way,
and <HI>both come and thank</HI> GOD <HI>for
nothing:</HI> Here we saw a Plan of a late
War like that in <HI>Ireland;</HI> there was all
the Officers cursing a Dutch <HI>General,</HI> be∣cause
the damn'd Rogue would fight, and
<HI>spoil a good War,</HI> that with decent Ma∣nagement
and <HI>good Husbandry,</HI> might have
been <HI>eek't out</HI> this Twenty Years; there
was whole Armies hunting two <HI>Cows</HI> to
one <HI>Irishsman,</HI> and driving of black Cattle
declar'd the <HI>Noble End of the War:</HI> Here
we saw a Country full of Stone Walls and
strong Towns, where every Campaign,
the Trade of War was carried on by the
Soldiers, with the same Intriguing as it
was carried on in the Council Chambers;
there was Millions of Contributions rai∣sed,
and vast Sums Collected, but no
<HI>Taxes lessn'd;</HI> whole <HI>Plate Fleets surpriz'd,</HI>
but no <HI>Treasure found;</HI> vast Sums <HI>lost</HI> by
Enemies, atnd yet never <HI>founnd</HI>
by Friends, Ships loaded with Volatile Silver, that came
away <HI>full,</HI> and gat home <HI>empty;</HI> whole
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
Voyages made to beat <HI>No body,</HI> and plun∣der
<HI>Every body;</HI> two Millions robb'd from
the honest Merchants, and not a Groat
sav'd for the honest Subjects: There we
saw Captains Listing Men with the Go∣vernments
Money, and letting them go
again for their own; Ships fitted out at
the Rates of Two Millions a Year, to fight
but once in Three Years, and then <HI>run
away</HI> for want of Powder and Shot.</P>
<P>There we saw <HI>Partition Treaties</HI> damn∣ed,
and the whole given away, <HI>Confedera∣cies</HI>
without <HI>Allies, Allies</HI> without <HI>Quota's
Princes</HI> without <HI>Armies, Armies</HI> without
<HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> without <HI>Money, Crowns</HI> wit∣hout
<HI>Kings, Kings</HI> without <HI>Subjects,</HI> more
<HI>Kings</HI> than <HI>Countries,</HI> and more <HI>Countries</HI>
than were worth fighting for.</P>
<P>Here we could see the King <HI>France</HI>
upbraiding his Neighbours with disho∣nourably
assisting his Rebels, <HI>though the
Misschief was, they did it not neither;</HI> and
in the same Breath, assisting the <HI>Hungar∣ian</HI>
Rebels against the Emperor; M. Ld N.
refusing so dishonourable an Action, as
to aid the Rebellious <HI>Camisars,</HI> but Lea∣guing
with the Admirant <HI>de Castile,</HI> to In∣vade
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
the Dominions of his Master to whom
he swore Allegiance: Here we saw Pro∣testants
fight against Protestants, <HI>to help
Papists,</HI> Papists against Papists <HI>to help Pro∣testants</HI> Protestants call in Turks, to keep
Faith against Christians <HI>that break it:</HI>
Here we could see <HI>Swedes</HI> fighting for Re∣venge,
and call it Religion; <HI>Cardinals</HI>
deposing their Catholick Prince, to intro∣duce
the Tyranny <HI>of a Lutheran,</HI> and call
it Liberty; <HI>Armies</HI> Electing Kings, and
call it Free Choice; <HI>French</HI> conquering
<HI>Savoy,</HI> to secure the Liberty of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>3. The Map of State Policy contains
abundance of Civil Transactions, no where
to be discover'd but in this <HI>wonderful Coun∣try,</HI>
and by this prodigious Invention:
As first, it shows an Eminent Prelate run∣ning
in every body's Debt to relieve the
Poor, and bring to <HI>God</HI> Robbery for
<HI>Burnt-Offering:</HI> It opens a Door to the
Fate of Nations; and there we might see
the <HI>Duke of S—y</HI> bought three times, and
his Subjects sold every time; <HI>Portugal</HI>
bought twice, and neither time worth
<HI>the Earnest; Spain</HI> bought once, but loth
to go with the <HI>Bidder; Venice</HI> willing to
be Bought, if there had been any Buyers;
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
<HI>Bavaria</HI> Bought, and run away with the
<HI>Money;</HI> the Emperor <HI>Bought</HI> and <HI>Sold,</HI>
but Bilkt the Chapman; the <HI>French</HI> buy∣ing
Kingdoms he can't <HI>keep,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>
keep Kingdoms they never <HI>Bought;</HI> and
the <HI>English</HI> paying their Money without
<HI>Purchase.</HI></P>
<P>In Matters of Civil Concerns, here was
to be seen <HI>Religion</HI> with no out-side, and
much Out-side with no Religion, much
Strife about <HI>Peace,</HI> and no Peace in <HI>the
Design:</HI> Here was Plunder without <HI>Vio∣lence,</HI>
Violence without <HI>Persecution,</HI> Con∣sicence
without <HI>Good works,</HI> and Good
Works without <HI>Charity;</HI> Parties cutting
one anothers Throats <HI>for God's sake,</HI> pul∣ling
down Churches <HI>de propoganda fide,</HI> and
making Divisions by way of <HI>Association.</HI></P>
<P>Here we have <HI>Peace and Ʋnion</HI> brought
to pass <HI>The Shortest Way,</HI> Extirpation and
Destruction prov'd to be the Road to
<HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Pleasure:</HI> Here all the Wise
Nations, a Learned Author would have
Quoted, <HI>if he could have found them,</HI> are
to be seen, who carry Exclusive Laws
to the general Safety and Satisfaction of
their Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
<HI>Occasional Bills</HI> may have here a parti∣cular
Historical, Categorical Description:
But of them by themselves.</P>
<P>Here you might have the Rise, Original,
Lawfulness, Usefulness, and Necessity of
<HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> as fairly represented as a
System of Divinity, and as clearly demon∣strated
<HI>as by a Geographical Description;</HI>
and which exceeds our mean Understand∣ing
here, 'tis by the wonderful Assistance
of these Glasses, plainly discerned to be
Coherent <HI>with Resistance, taking Arms,
calling in Foreign Powers, and the like.—</HI>
Here you have a plain Discovery of C. of
E. Politicks, and a Map of Loyalty: Here
'tis as plainly domonstratred as the Nose

a Man may <HI>Abdicate,</HI> drive away, and
<HI>Dethrone</HI> his Prince, and yet be absolute∣ly

of the least <HI>Fracture,</HI> Breach, Incroach∣ment,
or Intrenchment, upon the Doct∣rine
of <HI>Non-Resistance:</HI> Can <HI>shoot</HI> at his
Prince without any Design to <HI>kill him,
fight</HI> against him without raising <HI>Rebellion,</HI>
and take up Arms, without leaving War
against his Prince.</P>

Here they can persecute Dissenters,
without desiring they should Conform,
conform to the Church they would over∣throw;

Name,</HI> and <HI>Name</HI> the Prince they <HI>do not
Pray for.</HI></P>
<P>By the help of these Glasses strange In∣sights
are made, into the vast mysterious
dark World of <HI>State Policy;</HI> but that
which is yet more strange, and requires
vast Volumes to descend to the Particulars
of, and huge Diagrams, Spheres, Charts,
and a Thousand nice things to display is,
That in this vast Intelligent Discovery it
is not only made plain, that those things are
so, but all the vast Contradictions are
made Rational, reconciled to Practice,
and brought down to Demonstration.</P>
<P><HI>German Clock-Work,</HI> the perpetual Mo∣tions,
the Prim Mobilies of Our short-sighted
World, are Trifles to these Nicer
Disquisitions.</P>
<P>Here it would be plain and rational,
why a Parliament-Man will spend 5000 <HI>l.</HI>
to be Chosen, that cannot get a Groat
Honestly by <HI>setting there:</HI> It would be
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
easily made out to be rational, why he
that <HI>rails most</HI> at a Court is soonest re∣ceiv'd
<HI>into it:</HI> Here it would be very
plain, how great Estates are got in <HI>little
Places,</HI> and Double in <HI>none at all.</HI> 'Tis easy
to be prov'd honest and faithful to Victual
the <HI>French</HI> Fleet out of <HI>English</HI> Stores, and
let our own Navy want them; a long
Sight, or a large Lunar Perspective, will
make all these things not only plain in
Fact, but Rational and Justifiable to all
the World.</P>
<P>'Tis a strange thing to any body with∣out
doubt, that has not been in that
<HI>clear-sighted Region,</HI> to comprehend, That
those we call <HI>High-flyers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> are
the only Friends <HI>to the Dissenters,</HI> and
have been the most Diligent and Faithful
in their Interest, of any People in the
Nation; and yet so it is, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and
they ought to have the Thanks of the
<HI>whole Body</HI> for it.</P>
<P>In this advanc'd Station, we see it
plainly by Reflexion, That the Dissen∣ters,
like a parcel of Knaves, have retain∣ed
all the <HI>High-Church-men</HI> in their Pay;
they are certainly all in their <HI>Pension-Roll:</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Indeed, I could not see the Money paid
them there, it was too remote; but I
could plainly see the thing; all the
deep Lines of the Project are laid as
true, they are so <HI>Tackt</HI> and <HI>Consolidated</HI>
together, that if any one will give them∣selves
leave to consider, they will be most
effectually convinced, That the <HI>High-Church</HI>
and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> here, are all in a
Caball, a meer Knot, a piece of Clock∣work;
the Dissenters are the Dial-Plate,
and the High-Church the Movement, the
<HI>Wheel within the Wheels,</HI> the Spring and
the Screw to bring all things to Motion,
and make the <HI>Hand</HI> on the <HI>Dial-plate</HI>
point which way the <HI>Dissenters</HI> please.</P>
<P>For what else have been <HI>all the Shams</HI>
they have put upon the <HI>Governments,</HI>
Kings, States, and People they have been
concern'd with? What Schemes have
they laid on purpose <HI>to be broken?</HI> What
vast Contrivances, on purpose to be ridi∣cul'd
and expos'd? <HI>The Men are not Fools,</HI>
they had never V—d to <HI>Consolidate</HI> a
<HI>B</HI>—but that they were willing to save
the Dissenters, and put it into a pos∣ture,
in which they <HI>were sure it would
miscarry.</HI> I defy all the Wise Men of
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
the <HI>Moon</HI> to show another good reason
for it.</P>
<P>Methinks I begin to pity my Brethren,
the moderate Men of the Church, that
they cannot see into this <HI>New Plot,</HI> and
to wish they would but get up into our
<HI>Consolidator,</HI> and take a Journey to the
<HI>Moon,</HI> and there, by the help of these
Glasses, they would see the <HI>Allegorical,
Symbollical, Hetrodoxicallity</HI> of all this
Matter; it would make immediate Con∣verts
of them; they would see plainly,
that to <HI>Tack</HI> and <HI>Consolidate,</HI> to make
<HI>Exclusive Laws,</HI> to <HI>persecute</HI> for Conscience,
<HI>disturb,</HI> and <HI>distrest</HI> Parties; these are all
<HI>Phanatick Plots,</HI> meer Combinations against
the Church, to bring her into Contempt,
and to fix and establish the Dissenters to
the end of the Chapter: But of this I
shall find <HI>occasion</HI> to speak <HI>Occasionally,</HI>
when an <HI>Occasion</HI> presents it self, to exa∣mine
a certain <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> transacting
in these Lunar Regions, some time before
I had the Happiness to arrive there.</P>
<P>In examining the Multitude and Varie∣ty
of these <HI>most admirable Glasses</HI> for the
assisting the <HI>Opticks,</HI> or indeed the Forma∣tion
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
of a new perceptive Faculty; it was
you may be sure most surprizing, to find
there, that Art had exceeded Nature; and
the Power of Vision was assisted to that
prodigious Degree, as even to distinguish
<HI>Non-Entity it self;</HI> and in these strange
Engines of Light it could not but be very
pleasing, to distinguish plainly betwixt
<HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Matter,</HI> and to come to a De∣termination,
in the so long Canvast Dis∣pute
of Substance, <HI>vel Materialis, vel Spi∣ritualis;</HI>
and I can solidly affirm, That
in all our Contention between <HI>Entity</HI> and
<HI>Non-Entity,</HI> there is so <HI>little worth med∣dling
with,</HI> that had we had these Glasses
some Ages ago, we should have left trou∣bling
our Heads with it.</P>
<P>I take upon me, therefore, to assure
my Reader, That whoever pleases to
take a Journey, or Voyage, or Flight up
to these <HI>Lunar Regions,</HI> as soon as ever he
comes ashoar there, will presently be con∣vinc'd,
of the Reasonableness of <HI>Immate∣rial
Substance,</HI> and the <HI>Immortality,</HI> as
well as <HI>Immateriality</HI> of the Soul: He
will no sooner look into these Explicating
Glasses, but he will be able to know the
separate meaning of <HI>Body, Soul, Spirit,
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
Life, Motion, Death,</HI> and a Thousand
things that <HI>Wise-men</HI> puzzle themselves
about here, because they are not <HI>Fools
enough to understand.</HI></P>
<P>Here too I find Glasses for the <HI>Second
Sight,</HI> as our Old Women call it. This
<HI>Second Sight</HI> has been often pretended to
in <HI>Our Regions,</HI> and some Famous Old
Wives have told us, they can see <HI>Death,</HI>
the <HI>Soul, Futurity,</HI> and the Neighbour∣hood
of them, in the Countenance: By
this <HI>wonderful Art,</HI> these good People un∣fold
strange Mysteries, <HI>as</HI> under some <HI>Irre∣coverable</HI>
Disease, to foretell <HI>Death;</HI> un∣der
<HI>Hypovondriack</HI> Melancholy, to presage
<HI>Trouble of Mind;</HI> in pining Youth, to
predict <HI>Contagious Love;</HI> and an Hundred
other Infallibilities, <HI>which never fail to be
true as soon as ever they come to pass,</HI> and
are all grounded upon the same Infallibi∣lity,
by which a Shepherd may always
know when any one of his Sheep <HI>is Rot∣ten,</HI>
viz. <HI>when he shakes himself to pieces.</HI></P>
<P>But all this Guess and Uncertainty is a
Trifle, to the vast Discoveries of these
<HI>Explicatory Optick-Glasses;</HI> for here are
seen the Nature and Consequences of Se∣cret
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
Mysteries: Here are read strange
Mysteries relating to <HI>Predestination, Eter∣nal
Decrees,</HI> and the like: Here 'tis plain∣ly
prov'd, That <HI>Predestination</HI> is, in spight
of all Enthusiastick Pretences, so intirely
committed into Man's Power, that who∣ever
pleases to <HI>hang himself to Day,</HI> may won't
Live till to Morrow; no, though <HI>Forty
Predestination Prophets</HI> were to tell him,
<HI>His time was not yet come.</HI> These abstruse
Points are commonly and solemnly Dis∣cuss'd
here; and these People are such
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> that they say <HI>God's Decrees</HI> are
all subservient to the means of his <HI>Provi∣dence;</HI>
That what we call Providence is
a subjecting all things to the great <HI>Chain
of Causes and Consequences,</HI> by which that
one Grand Decree, That all Effects shall
Obey, without reserve to their proper
moving Causes, supercedes all <HI>subsequent
Doctrines,</HI> or pretended Decrees, or Pre∣destination
in the World: That by this
Rule, he that <HI>will kill himself,</HI> GOD,
Nature, Providence, or Decree, will not
see concerned <HI>to hinder him,</HI> but <HI>he shall
Die,</HI> any Decrees, Predestination, or
Fore-Knowledge of Infinite Powder, <HI>to the
contrary in any wise, notwithstanding</HI> that it
is in a Man's Power to throw himself into
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
the Water, <HI>and be Drown'd;</HI> and to kill
another Man, <HI>and he shall Die;</HI> and to say,
God appointed it, is to make him the
Author of Murther, and to injure the
Murtherer in putting him to Death for
what he could not help doing.</P>
<P>All these things are <HI>received Truths</HI> here,
and no doubt would be so every where else,
if the Eyes of Reason were open'd to the
Testimony of Nature, or if they had the
helps of these most <HI>Incomparable Glasses.</HI></P>
<P>Some pretended, by the help of these
<HI>Second-sight Glasses,</HI> to see the common
Periods of Life; and Others said, they
could see a great way beyond <HI>the leap in
the Dark:</HI> I confess, all I could see of the
first was, that holding up the Glass against
the Sea, I plainly saw, as it were on the
edge of the Horizon, these Words,
<Q><L>The Verge of Life and Death is here.</L>
<L>'Tis best to know where 'tis, but not how far.</L></Q></P>
<P>As to seeing <HI>beyond Death,</HI> all the Glas∣ses
I lookt into for that purpose, <HI>made
but little of it;</HI> and these were the only
<HI>Tubes</HI> that I found Defective; for here I
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
could discern nothing but Clouds, Mists,
and thick dark hazy Weather; but re∣volving
in my Mind, that I had read a
<HI>certain Book</HI> in our own Country, called,
<HI>Nature;</HI> it presently occurr'd, That the
Conclusion of it, to all such as gave them∣selves
the trouble of making out those
foolish things call'd Inferences, was al∣ways
<HI>Look up;</HI> upon which, turning one
of their Glasses <HI>Ʋp,</HI> and erecting the
Point of it towards the <HI>Zenith,</HI> I saw
these Words in the Air, <HI>REVELATION,</HI>
in large Capital Letters.</P>
<P>I had like to have rais'd the Mob upon
me for looking <HI>upright</HI> with this Glass;
for this, they said, was prying into the
Mysteries of the Great <HI>Eye</HI> of the World;
That we ought to enquire no farther than
he has inform'd us, and <HI>to believe</HI> what
he had left us <HI>more Obscure:</HI> Upon this,
I laid down the Glasses, and concluded,
that we had <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and
should be never the likelier to be taught
by <HI>One come from the</HI> Moon.</P>
<P>In short, I found, indeed, they had a
great deal more Knowledge of things than
we in this World; and that <HI>Nature, Sci∣ence,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
and <HI>Reason,</HI> had obtained great Im∣provements
in the <HI>Lunar World;</HI> but as
to <HI>Religion,</HI> it was the same equally re∣sign'd
to and concluded in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Re∣demption;</HI>
so I shall give the World no
great Information of these things.</P>
<P>I come next to some other strange Ac∣quirements
obtained by the helps of these
Glasses; and particularly for the discern∣ing
the <HI>Imperceptibles</HI> of Nature; such as,
the <HI>Soul, Thought, Honesty, Religion, Vir∣ginity,</HI>
and an Hundred other nice things,
too small for humane Discerning.</P>
<P>The Discoveries made by these Glasses,
as to the <HI>Soul,</HI> are of a very diverting
Variety; some <HI>Hieroglyphical,</HI> and <HI>Em∣blematical,</HI>
and some Demonstrative.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hieroglyphical</HI> Discoveries of the
Soul make it appear in the <HI>Image of its
Maker;</HI> and the Analogy is remarkable,
even in the very <HI>Simily;</HI> for as they re∣present
the Original of Nature as <HI>One
Great Eye,</HI> illuminating as well as discern∣ing
all things; so the <HI>Soul,</HI> in its <HI>Allego∣rical,</HI>
or <HI>Hieroglyphical</HI> Resemblance, ap∣pears
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
as a <HI>Great Eye,</HI> embracing the Man,
enveloping, operating, and informing eve∣ry
Part; <HI>from whence</HI> those fort of Peo∣ple
who we falsly call <HI>Politicians,</HI> affect∣ing
so much to put out <HI>this Great Eye,</HI> by
acting against their common Understand∣ings,
are very aptly represented by <HI>a great
Eye, with Six or Seven pair of Spectacles on;</HI>
not but that the Eye of their Souls may
be clear enough of it self, as to the com∣mon
Understanding; but that they hap∣pen
to have occasion to look sometimes
<HI>so many ways at once,</HI> and to judge, con∣clude,
and understand <HI>so many contrary
ways</HI> upon one and the same thing; that
they are fain to put double Glasses upon
their Understanding, as we look at the
<HI>Solar Ecclipses,</HI> to represent 'em in <HI>different
Lights,</HI> least <HI>their Judgments</HI> should not
<HI>be wheadled</HI> into a Compliance with the
<HI>Hellish Resolutions of their Wills;</HI> and this
is what I call the Emblematick Represen∣tation
of the Soul.</P>
<P>As for the Demonstrations of the <HI>Soul's
Existence,</HI> 'tis a plain case, by these <HI>Ex∣plicative
Glasses,</HI> that <HI>it is,</HI> some have pre∣tended
to give us the Parts; and we have
heard of Chyrurgeons, that could read
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
an Anatomical Lecture on the Parts of
the Soul; and these pretend it to be a
Creature in form, whether <HI>Camelion</HI> or
<HI>Salamandar,</HI> Authors have not determin'd;
nor is it compleatly discover'd <HI>when</HI> it
comes into the Body, or <HI>how</HI> it goes out,
or <HI>where</HI> its Locality or Habitation is,
while 'tis a Resident.</P>
<P>But they very aptly show it, like a
Prince, in his Seat, in the middle of <HI>his
Palace the Brain,</HI> issuing out his incessant
Orders to innumerable Troops of <HI>Nerves,
Sinews, Muscles, Tendons, Veins, Arteries,
Fibres, Capilarij,</HI> and <HI>useful Officers,</HI> call'd
<HI>Organici,</HI> who faithfully execute all the
Parts of <HI>Sensation, Locomotion, Concoction,</HI>
&amp;c. and in the Hundred Thousandth part
of <HI>a Moment,</HI> return with particular Mes∣sages
for <HI>Information,</HI> and demand New
<HI>Instructions.</HI> If any part of <HI>his Kingdom,
the Body,</HI> suffers a Depredation, or an
Invasion of the Enemy, the Expresses fly
to the Seat of the Soul, <HI>the Brain,</HI> and
immediately are order'd back <HI>to smart,</HI>
that the Body may of course send more
Messengers <HI>to complain;</HI> immediately o∣ther
Expresses are dispatcht to the Tongue,
with Orders <HI>to cry out,</HI> that the Neighbours
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
may come in and help, or Friends send
for the Chyrurgeon: Upon <HI>the Applica∣tion,</HI>
and a Cure, <HI>all is quiet,</HI> and the same
Expresses are dispatcht to the Tongue
<HI>to be hush,</HI> and say no more of it till far∣ther
Orders: All this is as plain to be
seen in these Engines, <HI>as the Moon</HI> of <HI>Our
World</HI> from the World in the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>As the Being, Nature, and Scituation
Of <HI>humane Soul</HI> is thus <HI>Spherically</HI> and <HI>Ma∣thematically</HI>
discover'd, I could not find
any Second Thoughts about it in all their
Books, whether of their own Composition
or by Translation; for it was a General
received Notion, That there could not
be a greater Absurdity in humane Know∣ledge,
than to imploy the Thoughts in
Questioning, what is as plainly known
by its Consequences, as if seen with <HI>the
Eye;</HI> and that to doubt the Being or Ex∣tent
of the Soul's Operation, is to <HI>imploy
her against her self;</HI> and therefore, when
I began to argue with my Old Philoso∣pher,
against the Materiality and Immor∣tality
of this Mystery we call <HI>Soul, he
laught at me,</HI> and told me, he found we
had none of their Glasses in our World;
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
and bid me send all our <HI>Scepticks, Soul-Sleepers,</HI>
our <HI>Cowards, Bakers, Kings</HI> and
<HI>Bakewells,</HI> up to him into the <HI>Moon,</HI> if
they wanted Demonstrations; where, by
the help of their Engines, they would
make it plain to them, that the <HI>Great Eye</HI>
being one vast Intellect, <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Eter∣nal,</HI>
all <HI>Inferior Life</HI> is a Degree of <HI>himself,</HI>
and as exactly represents him as one little
<HI>Flame</HI> the whole Mass of <HI>Fire;</HI> That it is
therefore uncapable of Dissolution, being
like its Original in Duration, as well as in
its Powers and Faculties, but that it goes
and returns by <HI>Emission, Regression,</HI> as the
<HI>Great Eye</HI> governs and determines; and
this was plainly made out, by the Figure
I had seen it in, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>Eye,</HI> the exact
Image of its Maker: 'Tis true, <HI>it was dark∣ned</HI>
by Ignorance, Folly and Crime, and
therefore oblig'd <HI>to wear Spectacles;</HI> but
tho' these were Defects or Interruptions in
its Operation, they were none in its Na∣ture;
which as it had its immediate Ef∣flux
from <HI>the Great Eye,</HI> and its return to
him must partake of himself, and could
not hut be of a Quality <HI>uncomatable,</HI> by
Casualty or Death.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>
From this Discourse we the more wil∣lingly
adjourned our present Thoughts, <HI>I
being clearly convinced of the Matter;</HI> and
as for our Learned Doctors, with their
Second and Third <HI>Thoughts,</HI> I told him I
would recommend them <HI>to the Man in the</HI>
Moon for their farther Illumination, which
if they refuse to accept, it was but just
they should remain <HI>in a Wood,</HI> where <HI>they
are,</HI> and are <HI>like to be,</HI> puzzling themselves
about Demonstrations, squaring of Circles,
and converting <HI>oblique</HI> into <HI>right Angles,</HI>
to bring out a Mathematical <HI>Clock-Work
Soul,</HI> that will go till the <HI>Weight is down,</HI>
and then stand still till <HI>they know not who</HI>
must wind it up again.</P>
<P>However, I cannot pass over a very
strange and extraordinary piece of Art
which this Old Gentleman inform'd me
of, and that was an Engine <HI>to screw a Man
into himself:</HI> Perhaps our Country-men
may be at some Difficulty to comprehend
these things by my dull Description; and
to such I cannot but recommend, a Jour∣ney
<HI>in my Engine to the</HI> Moon.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99"/>
This <HI>Machine</HI> that I am speaking of,
contains a multitude of <HI>strange Springs</HI> and
<HI>Screws,</HI> and a Man that puts himself into
it, is very insensibly carried into <HI>vast Spe∣culations,</HI>
Refflexions, and <HI>regular Debates
with himself:</HI> They have a very hard
Name for it in those Parts; but if I were
to give it an <HI>English</HI> Name, it should be
call'd, <HI>The Cogitator,</HI> or <HI>the Chair of Re∣flection.</HI></P>
<P>And First, The Person that is seated
here feels some pain in passing some <HI>Ne∣gative
Springs,</HI> that are wound up, effectu∣ally
to shut out all <HI>Injecting▪ Disturbing</HI>
Thoughts; and the better to prepare him
for the Operation that is to follow, and
this is without doubt a very rational
way; for when a Man can <HI>absolutely shut
out all manner of thinking,</HI> but what he is
upon, he shall think the more Intensly
upon the one object before him.</P>
<P>This Operation past, here are <HI>certain
Screws</HI> that draw <HI>direct Lines</HI> from every
<HI>Angle of the Engine to the Brain of the
Man,</HI> and at the same time, other direct
Lines to his Eyes; at the other end of
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
which Lines, there are Glasses which
convey or reflect the Objects the Person is
desirous to <HI>think upon.</HI></P>
<P>Then the main Wheels are turn'd, which
wind up according to their several Of∣fices;
<HI>this</HI> the Memory, <HI>that</HI> the Under∣standing,
a <HI>third</HI> the Will, a <HI>fourth</HI> the
thinking Faculty; and these being put
all into regular Motions, pointed by di∣rect
Lines to their proper Objects, and
perfectly uninterrupted by the Interven∣tion
of Whimsy, Chimera, and a Thou∣sand
fluttering <HI>Doemons</HI> that Gender in
the Fancy, but are effectually Lockt out
as before, assist one another to receive
right Notions, and form just Ideas of the
things they are directed to, and from
thence the Man is impower'd to make
right Conclusions, <HI>to think and act like
himself,</HI> suitable to the sublime Qualities
his Soul was originally blest with.</P>
<P>There never was a Man went into one
of these <HI>thinking Engines,</HI> but he came
wiser out than he was before; and I am
persuaded, it would be a more effectual
Cure to our <HI>Deism, Atheism, Scepticism,</HI>
and all other <HI>Scisms,</HI> than ever the <HI>Italian</HI>'s
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
Engine, for curing the Gout by cutting
off the Toe.</P>
<P>This is most wonderful Engine, and
performs admirably, and my Author gave
me extraordinary Accounts of the good
Effects of it; and I cannot but tell my
Reader, That our Sublunar World suffers
Millions of Inconveniencies, for want of
this thinking Engine: I have had a great
many Projects in my Head, how to bring
our People to regular thinking, but 'tis in
vain without this Engin; and how to
get the Model of it I know <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct; how to
screw up the Will, the Understanding,
and the rest of the Powers; how to bring
the Eye, the Thought, the Fancy, and
the Memory, into Mathematical Order,
and obedient to Mechanick Operation;
help <HI>Boyl, Norris, Newton, Manton, Ham∣mond,
Tillotson,</HI> and all the Learned Race,
help <HI>Phylosophy, Divinity, Physicks, Oeco∣nomicks,</HI>
all's in vain, a Mechanick Chair
of Reflection is the only Remedy that
ever I found in my Life for this Work.</P>
<P>As to the Effects of Mathematical think∣ing,
what Volumes might be writ of it
will more easily appear, if we consider the
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
wondrous Usefulness of this Engine in all
humane Affairs; as of <HI>War, Peace, Justice,
Injuries, Passion, Love, Marriage, Trade,
Policy,</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>When a Man has been screw'd into him∣self,
and brought by this Art to a Regu∣larity
of Thought, he never commits any
Absurdity after it; his Actions are squa∣red
by the same Lines, for Action is but
the Consequence of Thinking; and he
that acts before he thinks, sets humane
Nature with the bottom upward.</P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> would never have made his Speech,
nor the famous <HI>B—ly</HI> wrote a Book, if
ever they had been in this thinking En∣gine:
One would have never told us of
Nations he never saw, nor the other told
us, he had seen a great many, and was
never the Wiser.</P>
<P><HI>H.</HI> had never ruin'd his Family to Mar∣ry
Whore, Thief and Beggar-Woman, in

Our late unhappy Monarch had never
trusted the <HI>English</HI> Clergy, when they
preacht up that Non-Resistance, which
he must needs see they could never Pra∣ctice;
had his Majesty been screw'd up into
this <HI>Cogitator,</HI> he had presently reslected,
that it was against Nature to expect they
should stand still, and let him tread upon
them: That they should, whatever they
had preacht or pretended to, hold open
their Throats to have them be cut, and
tye their own Hands from resisting the Lord's Anointed.</P>
<P>Had some of our Clergy been screw'd
in this Engine, they had never turned
Martyrs for their Allegiance to the Late
King, only for the Lechery of having Dr.
<HI>S</HI>—in their Company.</P>
<P>Had our Merchants been manag'd in
this Engine, they had never trusted their
<HI>Turkey</HI> Fleet with a famous Squadron,
that took a great deal of care to Convoy
them safe into the Enemies Hands.</P>
<P>Had some People been in this Engine,
when they had made a certain League in
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
the World, in order to make amends for
a better made before, they would certain∣ly
have consider'd farther, before they had
embarkt with a Nation, that are neither
fit to go abroad nor stay at Home.</P>
<P>As for the Thinking practis'd in Noble
Speeches, <HI>Occasional Bills,</HI> Addressings a∣bout
Prerogative, Convocation Disputes,
Turnings in and Turnings out at Ours,
and all the Courts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> I have
nothing to say to it.</P>
<P>Had the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> been in our Engine, he would never have begun a
Quarrel, which he knew all the Powers
of <HI>Europe</HI> were concern'd to suppress, and
lay all other Business down till it was done.</P>
<P>Had the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> past the O∣peration
of this Engine, he would never
have beggar'd a Rich Electorate, to ruin
a beggar'd Crown, nor sold himself for a
Kingdom hardly worth any Man's taking:
He would never have made himself less
than he was, in hopes of being really no
greater; and step down from a Protestant
Duke, and Imperial Elector, to be a No∣minal
Mock-King with a shadow of Power,
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
and a Name without Honour, Dignity of
Strength.</P>
<P>Had Mons. <HI>Tallard</HI> been in our Engine,
he would not only not have attackt the
Confederates when they past the Morass
and Rivulet in his Front, but not have
attackt them at all, nor have suffer'd them
to have attackt him, it being his Business
not to have fought at all, but have lin∣ger'd
out the War, till the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>
having been reduced, the Confederate
Army must have been forced to have divi∣ded
themselves of course, in order to de∣fend
their own.</P>
<P>Some that have been very forward to
have us proceed <HI>The Shortest Way</HI> with the
<HI>Scots,</HI> may be said to stand in great need
of this Chair of Reflection, to find out a
just Cause for such a War, and to make
a Neighbour-Nation making themselves
secure, a sufficient Reason for another
Neighbour-Nation to fall upon them:
Our Engine would presently show it them
in a clear sight, by way of Paralel, that
'tis just with the same Right as a Man may
break open a House, because the People
bar and bolt the Windows.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106"/>
If some-body has chang'd Hands there
from bad to worse, and open'd instead of
closing Differences in those Cases, the
<HI>Cogitator</HI> migyt have brought them, by
more regular Thinking, to have known
that was not at all the Method of bring∣ing
the <HI>S—s</HI> to Reason.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Cogitator</HI> would be a very necessa∣ry
thing to show some People, That Po∣verty
and Weakness is not a sufficient
Ground to oppress a Nation, and their
having but little Trade, cannot be a suffi∣cient
Ground to equip Fleets to take away
what they have.</P>
<P>I cannot deny, that I have often thought
they have had something of this Engine
in our Neighbouring <HI>Antient Kingdom,</HI>
since no Man, however we pretend to be
angry, but will own they are in the right
of it, as to themselves, to Vote and pro∣cure
Bills for their own Security, and not
to do as others demand without <HI>Conditions</HI>
fit to be accepted: But of that by it self.</P>
<P>There are abundance of People in Our
World, of all sorts and Conditions, that
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
stand in need of our thinking Engines,
and <HI>to be screw'd into themselves a little,</HI>
that they might think as directly as they
speak absurdly: But of these also in a
Class by it self.</P>
<P>This Engine has a great deal of Philo∣sophy
in it; and particularly, 'tis a won∣derful
Remedy against <HI>Poreing;</HI> and as it
was said of Mons. <HI>Jurieu</HI> at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
that he us'd to <HI>lose himself in himself;</HI> by
the Assistance of this piece of Regularity,
a Man is most effectually secur'd against
<HI>bewildring Thoughts,</HI> and by direct think∣ing,
he prevents all manner of dangerous
wandring, since nothing can come to more
speedy Conclusions, than that which in
right Lines, points to the proper Subject
of Debate.</P>
<P>All sorts of <HI>Confusion of Thoughts</HI> are per∣fectly
avoided and prevented in this case,
and a Man is never troubled with <HI>Spleen,
Hyppo,</HI> or <HI>Mute Madness,</HI> when once he
has been thus under the Operation of <HI>the
Screw:</HI> It prevents abundance of Capital
Disasters in Men, in private Affairs; it
prevents <HI>hasty Marriages, rash Vows, Duels,
Quarrels,</HI> Suits at <HI>Law,</HI> and most sorts of
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
<HI>Repentance.</HI> In the State, it saves a Go∣vernment
from many Inconveniences; it
checks immoderate <HI>Ambition,</HI> stops <HI>Wars,
Navies</HI> and <HI>Expeditions;</HI> especially it pre∣vents
Members making <HI>long Speeches</HI> when
they have <HI>nothing to say;</HI> it keeps back
Rebellions, Insurrections, Clashings of
Houses, <HI>Occasional Bills, Tacking,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has a wonderful Property in our Af∣fairs
at Sea, and has prevented many a
<HI>Bloody Fight,</HI> in which a great many ho∣nest
Men might have lost their Lives that
are now useful Fellows, and help to Man
and manage Her Majesty's Navy.</P>
<P>What if some People are apt to charge
Cowardice upon some People in those
Cases? 'Tis plain <HI>that</HI> cannot be <HI>it,</HI> for
he that dare incur the Resentment of the
<HI>English</HI> Mob, shows more Courage than
would be able to carry him through For∣ty
Sea-fights.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore for want of being in this
Engine, that we censure People, because
they don't be knocking one another on
the Head, like the People at the <HI>Bear-Garden;</HI>
where, if they do not see the
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
<HI>Blood run about,</HI> they always cry out, <HI>A
Cheat;</HI> and the poor Fellows are fain to
cut one another, that they may not be
pull'd a pieces; where the Case is plain,
they are <HI>bold for fear,</HI> and pull up Cou∣rage
enough to Fight, because they are
afraid of the People.</P>
<P>This Engine prevents all sorts of <HI>Luna∣cies,
Love-Frenzies,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy-Mad∣ness,</HI>
for preserving the Thought in right
Lines to direct Objects, it is impossible
any <HI>Deliriums, Whimsies,</HI> or <HI>fluttering Air</HI>
of Ideas, can interrupt the Man, he can
never be Mad; for which reason I cannot
but recommend it to my Lord <HI>S</HI>—, my
Lord <HI>N</HI>—, and my Lord <HI>H</HI>—, as
absolutely necessary to defend them from
the State-Madness, which for some Ages
has possest their Families, and which runs
too much in the Blood.</P>
<P>It is also an excellent Introduction to
Thought, and therefore very well adapt∣ed
to those People whose peculiar Talent
and Praise is, That <HI>they never think at all.</HI>
Of these, if his Grace of <HI>B—d</HI> would please
to accept Advice from the <HI>Man in the
Moon,</HI> it should be to put himself into
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
this Engine, as a Soveraign Cure to the
known Disease call'd the <HI>Thoughtless Evil.</HI></P>
<P>But above all, it is an excellent Reme∣dy,
and very useful to a sort of People,
who are always <HI>Travelling</HI> in Thought,
but never <HI>Deliver'd</HI> into Action; who are
so exceeding busy at Thinking, they have
no leisure for Action; of whom the late
Poet sung well to the purpose;
<Q><L>—Some modern Coxcombs, who</L>
<L>Retire to Think, 'cause they have nought to do;</L>
<L>For Thoughts were giv'n for Actions Government,</L>
<L>Where Action ceases, Thought Impertinent:</L>

<P>These Gentlemen would make excellent
use of this Engine, for it would teach 'em
to dispatch one thing before they begin
another; and therefore is of singular use
to honest <HI>S</HI>—, whose peculiar it was,
to be always beginning Projects, but ne∣ver
finish any.</P>
<P>The Variety of this Engine, its Uses,
and Improvements, are Innumerable, and
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
the Reader must not expect I can give
any thing like a perfect Description of it.</P>
<P>There are yet another sort of Machine,
which I never obtained a sight of, till the
last Voyage I made to this Lunar Orb
and these are called <HI>Elevators:</HI> The Me∣chanick
Operations of these are wonder∣ful,
and helpt by Fire; by which the
Sences are raised to <HI>all the strange Extreams</HI>
we can imagine, and whereby the Intel∣ligent
Soul is made to converse with its
own Species, whether embody'd or not.</P>
<P>Those that are rais'd to a due pitch in
this wondrous Frame, have clear Pros∣pect
into the World of Spirits, and con∣verse
with <HI>Visions, Guardian-Angels, Spi∣rits
departed,</HI> and what not: And as this
is a wonderful Knowledge, and not to be
obtained, but by the help of this Fire;
so those that have try'd the Experiment,
give strange Accounts of <HI>Sympathy, Prex∣istence</HI>
of Souls, <HI>Dreams,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I confess, I always believ'd a converse
of Spirits, and have heard of some who
have experienced so much of it, as they
could obtain upon <HI>no Body else</HI> to believe.</P>
<P>I never saw any reason to doubt the
Existent State of the Spirit before embo∣dy'd,
any more than I did of its Immor∣tality
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
after it shall be uncas'd, and the
Scruptures saying, the Spirit returns to
God that gave it, implies <HI>a coming from,</HI>
or how could it be call'd <HI>a return.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can I see a reason why Embodying
a Spirit should altogether Interrupt its
Converse with the World of Spirits, from
whence it was taken; and to what else
shall we ascribe <HI>Guardian Angels,</HI> in which
the Scripture is also plain; and from
whence come <HI>Secret Notices,</HI> Impulse of
<HI>Thought,</HI> pressing <HI>Ʋrgencies of Inclination,</HI>
to or from this or that altogether Invo∣luntary;
but from some <HI>waking kind As∣sistant
wandering Spirit,</HI> which gives secret
hints to its Fellow-Creature, of some ap∣proaching
Evil or Good, which it was
not able to foresee.</P>

<HEAD>For Spirits without the helps of Voice converse.</HEAD>
<P>I know we have supplied much of this
with <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and <HI>conceited Revelation;</HI>
but the People of this World convince us,
that it may be all Natural, by obtaining
it in a Mechanick way, <HI>viz.</HI> by forming
something suitable to the sublime Na∣ture,
which working by Art, shall only
rectify the more <HI>vigorous Particles</HI> of the
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
Soul, and work it up to <HI>a suitable Eleva∣tion.</HI>
This Engine is wholly applied to
the Head, and Works by Injection; the
chief Influence being on what we call
<HI>Fancy,</HI> or Imagination, which by the heat
of strong Ideas, is fermented to a strange
heighth, and is thus brought to see back∣ward
and forward every way, beyond it
self: By this a Man fancies himself <HI>in the
Moon,</HI> and realizes things there as distinct∣ly,
as if he was actually talking to <HI>my Old
Phylosopher.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed is an admirable Engine,
'tis compos'd of <HI>an Hundred Thousand</HI> ra∣tional
Consequences, <HI>Five times the num∣ber</HI>
of Conjectures, Supposes, and Proba∣bilities,
besides an innumerable Company
of fluttering Suggestions, and Injections,
which hover round the Imagination and
are all taken in as fast as they can be Con∣cocted
and Digested there: These are
form'd into Ideas, and some of those so
well put together, so exactly shap'd, so
well drest and set out by the Additional
Fire of Fancy, that it is no uncommon
thing for the Person to be intirely decei∣ved
by himself, not knowing <HI>the brat of
his own Begetting,</HI> nor be able to distin∣guish
between Reality and Representa∣tion:
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
From hence we have some People
talking to Images of their own forming;
and seeing more Devils and Spectres than
ever appear'd: From hence we have weak∣er
Heads not able to bear the Operation,
seeing imperfect Visions, as of Horses and
Men without Heads or Arms, <HI>Light</HI> with∣out
<HI>Fire,</HI> hearing <HI>Voices</HI> without <HI>Sound,</HI>
and Noises without <HI>Shapes,</HI> as their own
Fears or Fancies broke the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> be∣fore
the intire Formation.</P>
<P>But the more Genuine and perfect Use
of these vast Elevations of the Fancy,
which are perform'd, as I said, by the
Mechanick Operation of Innate Fire, is
to guide Mankind to as much Fore-sight
of things, as either by Nature, or by the
Aid of any thing Extranatural, may be
obtain'd; and by this exceeding Know∣ledge,
a Man shall forebode to himself
approaching Evil or Good, so as to avoid
this, or be in the way of that; and what
if I should say, That the Notices of these
things are not only frequent, but constant,
and require nothing of us; but to make
use of this <HI>Elevation,</HI> to keep our Eyes,
our Ears, and our Fancies open to the
hints; and observe them;

You may suppose me, if you please,
come by this time into those Northern
Kingdoms I mention'd before, where
my Old Philospher was a Native, and
not to trouble you with any of the need∣ful
Observations, Learned Inscriptions,
<HI>&amp;c. on the way,</HI> according to the lauda∣ble
practices of the Famous Mr. <HI>Br—mly,</HI>
'tis sufficient to tell you I found there an
<HI>Opulent, Populous, Potent</HI> and <HI>Terrible
People.</HI></P>
<P>I found them at War with one of the
greatest Monarchs of the <HI>Lunar</HI> World,
and at the same time miserably rent and
torn, mangl'd and disorder'd among
themselves.</P>
<P>As soon as I observ'd the Political
posture of their Affairs, (for here a Man
sees things mighty soon by the helps of
such a Masterly Eye-sight as I have men∣tion'd)
and remembring what is said for
our Instruction, <HI>That a Kingdom divided
against its self cannot stand;</HI> I ask'd the
Old Gentleman if he had <HI>any Estate</HI> in
that Country? He told me, no great
matter; but ask'd me why I put that
Question to him? <HI>Because,</HI> said I, <HI>if this
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
People go on fighting and snarling at all the
World, and one among another in this man∣mer,
they will certainly be Ruin'd and Ʋn∣done,
either subdu'd by some more powerful
Neighbour; whilst one Party will stand still
and see the t'others Throat cut, tho' their
own Turn immediately follows, or else they
will destroy and devour one another.</HI> There∣fore
I told him I would have him Turn
his Estate into Money, and go some
where else; or go back to the other
World with me.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>reply'd the Old Man,</HI> I am
in no such Fear at this Time, the Scale
of Affairs is very lately chang'd here, <HI>says
he,</HI> in but a very few Years.</P>
<P>I know nothing of that, <HI>said I,</HI> but I
am sure there never was but one spot of
Ground in that World which I came from,
that was divided like them, and that's that
very Country I liv'd in. Here are three
Kingdoms of you in one spot, <HI>said I, One</HI> has
already been <HI>Conquer'd and Subdu'd, the
t'other</HI> suppress'd its Native Inhabitants,
<HI>and planted it with her own, and now
carries it with so high a Hand over them
of her own Breed, that</HI> she limits their
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
Trade, stops their Ports, when the Inhabi∣tants
have made their Manufactures, these
wont give them leave to send them abroad,
impose Laws upon them, refuse to alter and
amend those they would make for themselves,
make them pay Customs, <HI>Excises,</HI> and <HI>Taxes,</HI>
and yet <HI>pay the Garrisons and Guards</HI> that
defend them, themselves; Press their Inha∣bitants
to their Fleets, and carry away their
Old Veteran Troops that should defend them,
and leave them to raise more to be serv'd in
the same manner, will let none of their Mony
be carry'd over thither, nor let them Coin
any of their own; <HI>and a great many such
hardships they suffer under the Hand of
this Nation</HI> as meer Slaves <HI>and</HI> Conquer'd
People, tho' the greatest part of the Traders
are the People of the very Nation that treats
'em thus.</P>
<P>On the other hand, this creates Eternal
Murmurs, Heart-burnings and Regret,
both in the Natives and the Transplant∣ed
Inhabitants; the first have shewn
their Uneasiness by frequent Insurrecti∣ons
and Rebellions, for Nature prompts
the meanest Animal to struggle for Li∣berty;
and these struggles have often
been attended with great Cruelty, Ra∣vages,
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>
Death, Massacres, and Ruin both
of Families and the Country it self: As
to the Transplanted Inhabitants, they
run into Clandestine Trade, into corres∣ponding
with their Masters Enemies,
<HI>Victualling their Navies,</HI> Colonies and
the like, receiving and importing their
Goods in spight of all the Orders and Di∣rections
to the contrary.</P>
<P>These are the effects of Divisions, and
Feuds on that side; on the other hand
there is a Kingdom <HI>Entire</HI> Unconquer'd
and <HI>Independent,</HI> and for the present, un∣der
the same Monarch with the rest.—
But here their Feuds are greater than
with the other, and <HI>more dangerous by far</HI>
because National: This Kingdom joins
to the North part of the first Kingdom,
and Terrible Divisions ly among the
two Nations.</P>
<P>The People of these two Kingdoms
are call'd if you please for distinction
sake, for I cannot well make you under∣stand
their hard Names, <HI>Solunarians</HI>
and <HI>Nolunarians,</HI> these to the <HI>South</HI> and
those to the <HI>North,</HI> the <HI>Solunarians</HI> were
divided in their Articles of Religion;
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>
the Governing Party, or the Establish'd
Church, I shall call the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Church; but the whole Kingdom was
full of a sort of Religious People call'd
<HI>Crolians,</HI> who like our Dissenters in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
profess divers sub-divided Opinions
by themselves, and cou'd not, or wou'd
not, let it go which way it will, joyn
with the Establish'd Church.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Establish'd
Church in the Northern Kingdom was
all <HI>Crolians,</HI> but full of <HI>Solunarians</HI> in
Opinions, who were Dissenters there, as
the <HI>Crolians</HI> were Dissenters in the South,
and this unhappy mixture occasion'd
endless Feuds, Divisions, Sub-divisions
and Animosities without Number, of
which hereafter.</P>
<P>The Northern Men are Bold, Terrible
Numerous and <HI>Brave,</HI> to the last Degree,
but Poor, and by the Encroachments of
their Neighbours, growing poorer every
Day.</P>
<P>The Southern are equally Brave, more
Numerous and Terrible, but Wealthy
and <HI>care not for Wars,</HI> had rather stay at
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>
Home and Quarrel with one another,
than go Abroad to Fight, making good
an Old Maxim, <HI>Too Poor t' Agree, and yet
too Rich to Fight.</HI></P>
<P>Between these the Feud is great, and
every Day growing greater; and those
People who pretend to have been in the
<HI>Cogitator or thinking Engine</HI> tell us, all the
lines of Consequences in that Affair point
at a fatal period between the Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The Complaints also are great, and
back'd with fiery Arguments on both
sides; the Northern Men say, the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
have dealt unjustly and unkindly
by them in several Articles; but the
Southern Men reply with a most power∣ful
Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> they are <HI>Poor,</HI> and
therefore ought to be Oppress'd, Sup∣press'd, or <HI>any thing.</HI></P>
<P>But the main Debate is like to lye up∣pon
the Article of Choosing <HI>a King,</HI> both
the Nations being under one Govern∣ment
at present, but the Settlement
ending in the Reigning Line, the Nor∣thern
Men refuse to joyn in Government
again, unless they have a rectification
of some Conditions in which, they say,
they have the worst of it.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="123"/>
In this case, even the Southern Men
themselves, say, they believe the <HI>Nolu∣narians</HI>
have been in the <HI>Chair of Reflecti∣on,</HI>
the <HI>thinking Engine,</HI> and that having
screw'd their Understandings into a Di∣rect
Position to that Matter before them,
they have made a right Judgment of
their own Affairs, and <HI>with all their Po∣verty</HI>
stand on the best Foot <HI>as to Right.</HI></P>
<P>But as the matter of this Northern
Quarrel comes under a Second Head, and
is more properly the Subject of a Second
Voyage to the <HI>Moon;</HI> the Reader may
have it more at large consider'd in ano∣ther
Class, and some farther Enlight∣nings
in that Affair than perhaps can
be reasonably expected of me here.</P>
<P>But of all the Feuds and Brangles that
ever poor Nation was embroild in, of all
the Quarrels, the Factions and Parties
that ever the People of any Nation
thought worth while to fall out for, none
were ever in <HI>reality</HI> so light, in <HI>effect</HI> so
heavy, in <HI>appearance</HI> so great, in <HI>substance</HI>
so small, in <HI>name</HI> so terrible, in <HI>nature</HI> so
trifling, as those for which this Southern
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
Country was altogether by the Ears
among themselves.</P>
<P>And this was one Reason why I so
earnestly enquir'd of my <HI>Lunarian Phi∣losopher,</HI>
whether he had an Estate in
that Country or no. But having told
him the Cause of that enquiry, he re∣ply'd,
there was one thing in the Na∣ture
of his Country-men which secur'd
them from the ruin which usually at∣tended
<HI>divided Nations, viz.</HI> that if any
Foreign Nation thinking to take the ad∣vantage
of their Intestine Divisions <HI>fell
upon them</HI> in the highest of all their
Feuds, they'd lay aside their Parties and
Quarrels and presently <HI>fall in together</HI> to
beat out the common Enemy; and then
no sooner had they obtain'd <HI>Peace abroad,</HI>
by their Conduct and Bravery, but they
would fall to cutting one anothers
Throats again at home <HI>as naturally</HI> as if
it had been their proper Calling, and
that for Trifles too, <HI>meer Trifles.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, said I to <HI>my learned Self,</HI>
pretty like my own Country still, that
whatever Peace they have <HI>abroad,</HI> are
sure to have none <HI>at home.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="125"/>
To come at the historical Account of
these <HI>Lunarian</HI> Dissentions, it will be
absolutely necessary to enter a little into
the Story of <HI>the Place,</HI> at least as far as
relates to the present Constitution, both
of the People, the Government, and the
Subject of their present Quarrels.</P>
<P>And first we are to understand, that
there has for some Ages been carry'd on
in these Countries, a private feud or
quarrel among the People, about a thing
call'd by them <HI>Ʋpogyla,</HI> with us very
vulgarly call'd <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>This Difference, as in its Original
it was not great, nor indeed upon Points
accounted among themselves Essential,
so it had never been a Difference of any
height, if there had not always been some
one thing, or other, hapning in the State
which made the Court-Polititians think
it necessary to keep the People busy and
embroil'd, to prevent their more nar∣row
Inspection into Depredations and
Encroachments on their Liberties, which
was always making on them by the
Court.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="126"/>
'Tis not deny'd but there might be a
Native want of Charity in the Inhabi∣tant,
adapting them to Feud, and parti∣cularly
qualifying them to be always
Piquing one another; and some of their
own Nation, who by the help of the
famous Perspectives before-mentioned,
pretend to have seen farther into the
Insides of Nature and Constitution than
other People, tell us the cross Lines of
Nature which appear in the make of
those particular People, signify a direct
<HI>Negative</HI> as to the Article of <HI>Charity</HI> and
good Neighbour-hood.</P>
<P>'Twas particularly unhappy to this
wrangling People, that Reasons of State
should always fall in, to make that un∣charitableness
and continual quarrelling
Humour necessary to carry on the Pub∣lick
Affairs of the Nation, and may
pass for a certain Proof, that the State
was under some Diseases and Convul∣sions,
which, like a Body that digests
nothing so well as what is hurtful to
its Constitution, makes use of those
things for its Support, which are in
their very Nature, fatal to its being,
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
and must at last tend to its Destru∣ction.</P>
<P>But as this however enclin'd them
to be continually <HI>Snarling</HI> at one ano∣ther,
so as in all Quarrels it generally
appears one Side must go down.</P>
<P>The prevailing Party therefore al∣ways
kept the Power in their Hands,
and as the <HI>under</HI> were always Subject
to the lash they soon took care to hook
their Quarrel into the Affairs of State,
and so join <HI>Religious</HI> Differences, and
<HI>Civil</HI> Differences together.</P>
<P>These things had long embroil'd the
Nation, and frequently involv'd them
in bitter Enmities, Feuds, and Quarrels,
and once in a tedious, ruinous, and bloody
War in their own Bowels, in which, con∣trary
to all expectation, this <HI>lesser Party</HI>
prevail'd.</P>
<P>And since the allegorick Relation
may bear great Similitude with our
European Affairs on this side <HI>the Moon:</HI>
I shall for the ease of Expression, and
the better Understanding of the Read∣er,
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>
frequently call them by the same
Names our unhappy Parties are call'd
by in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Solunnarian Church∣men,</HI>
and <HI>Crolian Dissenters,</HI> at the same
time desiring my Reader to observe,
that he is <HI>always to remember</HI> who it is
we are talking of, and that he is <HI>by no
means</HI> to understand me of any Person,
Party, People, Nation, or Place on
this side the Moon, any Expression,
Circumstance, Similitude, or Appear∣ance
<HI>to the contrary in any wise notwith∣standing.</HI></P>
<P>This premis'd, I am to tell the Read∣er
that the last Civil War in this <HI>Lunar</HI>
Country ended in the Victors confound∣ing
their own Conquests by their intest∣ine
Broils, they being as is already not∣ed
a most Eternally Quarrelling Nation;
upon this new Breach, they that first
began the War, turn'd about, and plead∣ing
that they took up Arms to regulate
the Government, not to overthrow it,
fell in with the Family of their Kings,
who had been banish'd, <HI>and one of
them destroy'd,</HI> and restor'd the Crown
to the Family, and the Nation to the
Crown, just <HI>for all the World</HI> as the <HI>Pres∣byterians</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
in <HI>England</HI> did, in the Case of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>The Party that was thus restor'd,
accepted the return the others made
to their Duty, and their Assistance in
restoring the Family of their Monarch,
but abated not a Tittle of the old Ran∣cour
against them <HI>as a Party</HI> which they
entertain'd at their first taking Arms,
not allowing the return they had made
to be <HI>any attonement at all</HI> for the Crimes
they had been guilty of before. 'Tis
true they pass'd an Act or Grant of <HI>General
Pardon,</HI> and Oblivion, as in all
such Cases is usual, and as without which
the other would never ha' come in, or
have join'd Powers to form the Resto∣ration
they were bringing to pass, but
the old Feud of Religion continu'd with
this addition, that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> were <HI>Re∣bels,
Murtherers, King-killers,</HI> Enemies to
<HI>Monarchy</HI> and Civil Government, lovers
of Confusion, popular, anarchial Go∣vernments,
and movers of Sedition;
that this was in their very <HI>Nature</HI> and
<HI>Principles,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="130"/>
In this Condition, and under these
Mortifications this Party of People liv'd
just an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Servitude, <HI>viz.</HI> of 40
Years, in which time they were fre∣quently
vex'd with Persecution, <HI>Ha∣rass'd,</HI>
Plunder'd, <HI>Fin'd,</HI> Imprisoned, and
very hardly Treated, insomuch that they
pretend to be able to give an account
of vast Sums of their Country-Mony,
levy'd upon them on these Occasions,
amounting as I take it to 2 Millions of
<HI>Lunatians,</HI> a Coin they keep their Ac∣counts
by there, and much about the
value of our Pound Sterling; besides
this they were hook't into a great ma∣ny
Sham Plots, and Sworn out of their
<HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Estates</HI> in such a manner, that
in the very next Reign the Government
was so sensible of their hard treatment,
that they revers'd several Sentences by
the same Authority that had Executed
them; a most undeniable Proof they
were asham'd of what had been done;
at last, the Prince who was restor'd as
abovesaid, dyed, and his Brother mount∣ed
the Throne; and now began <HI>a third
Scene</HI> of Affairs, for this Prince was
neither <HI>Church-man,</HI> nor <HI>Dissenter,</HI> but
of a different Religion from them all
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
known in that Country by the Name of
<HI>Abrogratzianism,</HI> and this Religion of his
had this one absolutely necessary Conse∣quence
in it, that a Man could not be
sincerely and heartily of this, but he must
be an Implacable hater of both the o∣ther.
As this is laid down as a previ∣ous
Supposition, we are with the same
Reason to imagine this Prince to be en∣tirely
bent upon the Suppression and
Destruction of both the other, if not
<HI>absolutely</HI> as to Life and Estate, yet <HI>en∣tirely</HI>
as to Religion.</P>
<P>To bring this the more readily to pass
like a true Polititian, had his Methods
and Particulars been equally Politick
with his Generals, he began at the right
End, <HI>viz.</HI> to make the Breach between
the <HI>Solunnarian Church,</HI> and the <HI>Crolian
Dissenters as wide as possible,</HI> and to do
this it was resolv'd to shift Sides, and
as the Crown had always took part
with the Church, crush'd, humbl'd,
persecuted, and by all means possible
mortify'd the Dissenters, as is noted in
the Reign of his Predecessor. This
Prince resolv'd to caress, cherish, and
encourage the <HI>Crolians</HI> by all possible
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
Arts and outward Endearments, not so
much that they purpos'd them any real
Favour, <HI>for the destruction of both was
equally determin'd,</HI> nor so much that they
expected to draw them over to <HI>Abro∣gratrianism,</HI>
but Two Reasons may
be suppos'd to give Rise to this Project.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Lunarian Church</HI> Party had all
along Preach'd up for a part of their Re∣ligion,
that <HI>Absolute undisputed Obedience,</HI>
was due from every Subject to their
Prince without any <HI>Reserve,</HI> Reluctance
or <HI>Repining;</HI> that as to Resistance, it was
Fatal to <HI>Body, Soul, Religion, Justice</HI> and
<HI>Government;</HI> and tho' the Doctrine was
Repugnant to <HI>Nature,</HI> and to the very
Supreme Command it self, yet he that
resisted, receiv'd to himself Damnation,
just <HI>for all the World</HI> like our Doctrine of
<HI>Passive Obedience.</HI> Now tho' these <HI>Solu∣narian</HI>
Church-Men did not absolutely
believe all they said themselves to be
true, yet they found it necessary to push
these things to the uttermost Extremi∣ties,
because they might the better fix
upon the <HI>Crolian Dissenters,</HI> the Charge
of professing less Loyal Principles than
they. For as to the <HI>Crolians,</HI> they pro∣fess'd
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>
openly they would pay Obedience
to the Prince, as far as the Laws direct∣ed,
<HI>but no farther.</HI></P>
<P>These things were run up to strange
heights, and the People were always
falling out about what they would do,
or wou'd not do, if things were <HI>so or so,</HI>
as they were not, and <HI>were never likely to
be;</HI> and the hot Men on both sides were
every now and then going together by
the Ears about <HI>Chimeras,</HI> Shadows, <HI>May∣be's</HI>
and <HI>Supposes.</HI></P>
<P>The hot Men of the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI>
were for knocking the <HI>Crolians</HI> in the
Head, because as they said they were
<HI>Rebels,</HI> their <HI>Fathers</HI> were Rebels, and
they would certainly turn Rebels again
upon occasion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians</HI> insisted upon it, that they
had nothing to do with what was done
before they were Born, that if they were
Criminal, because their Fathers were so,
then a great many who were now of the
<HI>Solunarian Church</HI> were as Guilty as they,
several of the best Members of that
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
Church having been Born of <HI>Crolian</HI>
Parents.</P>
<P>In the matter of Loyalty they insisted
upon it, they were as Loyal as the <HI>Solu∣narians,</HI>
for that they were as Loyal as
Nature, Reason and the Laws both of
God and Man requir'd, and what the
other talk'd of <HI>more,</HI> was but a meer
pretence, and so it would be found if
ever their Prince should have occasion
to put them to the Tryal, that he that
pretended to go beyond the Power of
Nature and Reason, <HI>must indeed go beyond
them,</HI> and they never desir'd to be brought
into the extream, but they were ready
at any time to shew such Proofs, and
give such Demonstrations of their Loy∣alty,
as would satisfy any reasonable
Prince, and <HI>for more they had nothing to
say.</HI></P>
<P>In this posture of Affairs, this new
Prince found his Subjects when he came
to the Crown, the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> Ca∣ress'd
him, and notwithstanding his be∣ing
Devoted to the <HI>Abrogratzian Faith,</HI>
they Crown'd him with extraordinary
Acclamations.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="135"/>
They were the rather enclin'd to
push this forward by how much they
thought it would singularly mortify the
<HI>Crolians,</HI> and all the sorts of <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
for they had all along declar'd their ab∣horrence
of the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> to such a
Degree that they publickly endeavour'd
to have got a general Concurrence of
the whole Nation in the Publick <HI>Cortez,</HI>
or <HI>Dyet</HI> of the Kingdom, to have joyn'd
with them in Excluding this very Prince
by Name, and all other Princes that
should ever embrace the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI>
Faith.</P>
<P>And it wanted but a very little of bring∣ing
it to pass, for almost all the Great
Men of the Nation, tho' <HI>Solunarians,</HI> yet
that were Men of <HI>Temper,</HI> Moderation,
and <HI>Fore-sight,</HI> were for this exclusive
Law. But the <HI>High Priests</HI> and <HI>Patri∣archs</HI>
of the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> prevented
it, and upon pretence of this <HI>Passive O∣bedience
Principle,</HI> made their Interest
and gave their Voices for Crowning, or
Entailing the Crown and Government
on the Head of one of the most Impla∣cable
Enemies both to their Religion
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
and Civil Right that ever the Nation
saw; <HI>but they liv'd to Repent it too late.</HI></P>
<P>This Conquest over the <HI>Crolians</HI> and
the <HI>Moderate Solunarians,</HI> if it did not sup∣press
them entirely, it yet gave the other
Party such an ascendant over them,
that they made no Doubt when that
Prince came to the Crown, they had
done so much to oblige him, that he
could deny them nothing, and therefore
in expectation they swallow'd up the
whole Body of the <HI>Crolians</HI> at once, and
began to talk of nothing less than Ba∣nishing
them to the Northern part of the
Country, or to certain Islands, and
Countries a vast way off, where former∣ly
great numbers of them had fled for
shelter in like Cases.</P>
<P>And this was the more probable by
an unhappy Stroke these <HI>Crolians</HI> at∣tempted
to strike, <HI>but miscarry'd</HI> in at the
very beginning of this Prince's Reign:
for as they had always profest an aver∣sion
to this Prince on account of his Re∣ligion,
as soon as their other King was
dead, they set up one of his Natural
Sons against this King, which the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
had so joyfully Crown'd. This
young Prince invaded his Dominions, and
great Numbers of the most zealous
<HI>Crolians</HI> joyn'd him—But to cut the
Story short, he was entirely routed by
the Forces of the new Prince, for all
the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> joyn'd with him
against the <HI>Crolians</HI> without any respect
to the Interest of Religion, so they over∣threw
their Brethren: The young in∣vaded
Prince was taken and put to
Death openly, and <HI>Great Cruelties</HI> were
exercis'd in cold Blood upon the poor
unhappy People that were taken in the
Defeat!</P>
<P>Thus a second time these Loyal <HI>Solu∣narian
Church-men</HI> Establish'd their E∣nemy,
and built up what they were glad
afterwards to pull down again, and to
beg the assistance of those very <HI>Crolians</HI>
whom they had so rudely handled, to
help them demolish the Power they
had erected themselves, and which now
began to set its foot upon the Throat of
those that nourish'd and supported it.</P>
<P>Upon this exceeding Loyalty and
blind Assistance given to their Prince,
<PB N="134" REF="138"/>
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> made no question but
they had so Eternally bound him to
them, that it would be in their Power to
pull down the very Name of <HI>Crolianism,</HI>
and utterly destroy it from the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>But the time came on to Undeceive
them, for this Prince, whose Principle as
an <HI>Abrogratzian,</HI> was to destroy them
both, as it happened, was furnish'd with
Counsellors and Ecclesiasticks of his own
Profession, ten thousand Times more
bent for their general Ruin, than him∣self.</P>
<P>For abstracted from the Venom and
Rancour of his Profession as an <HI>Abrograt∣zian,</HI>
and from the furious Zeal of his
<HI>Bramin,</HI> Priests, and Religious People,
that continually hung about him, and that
prompted him to act against his Temper
and Inclination, by which he ruin'd all,
he was else a <HI>forward</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Prince,
and likely to have made his People Great
and Flourishing.</P>
<P>But his <HI>furious Church-Men</HI> ruin'd all
his good Designs, and turn'd all his
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
Projects to compass the Introduction of
his own Religion into his Dominions.</P>
<P>Nay, and had he not fatally been
push'd on by such as really design'd his
Ruin, to drive this deep Design on too
hastily and turn the Scale of his Man∣nagement
from a close and conceal'd,
to an open and profess'd Design, he
might have gone a great way with it.—Had
he been content to have let
that have been twenty Year a doing,
which he impatiently as well as pre∣posterously
attempted all at once.—<HI>Wise
Men have thought</HI> he might in time
have supprest the <HI>Solunarian Religion,</HI>
and have set up his own.</P>
<P>To give a short Scheme of his Pro∣ceedings,
and with them of the reason of
his Miscarriage.</P>
<P>1. Having defeated the Rebellious
<HI>Crolians,</HI> as is before noted, and reflect∣ing
on the Danger he was in upon the
sudden Progress of that Rebellion, for
indeed he was within a trifle of Ruin
in that Affair; and had not the <HI>Crolians</HI>
been deceiv'd bp the darkness of the
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
Night and led to a large Ditch of Water,
which they could not pass over, they
had certainly surpriz'd and overthrown
his Army, and cut them in pieces, before
they had known who had hurt them. Up∣on
the Sense of this Danger, he takes
up a pretence of necessity for the being al∣ways
ready to resist <HI>the Factious Crolians,</HI>
as he call'd them, and by that Insinua∣tion
hooks himself into a <HI>standing Army
in time of Peace;</HI>—nay, and so easy
were the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> to yield up
any point, which they did but imagin
would help to crush their Brethren the
<HI>Crolians,</HI> that they not only consented to
this unusual Invasion of their antient Li∣berties,
but sent up several <HI>Testimonials</HI>
of their free Consent, nay, and of their
Joy of having arriv'd to so great a Hap∣piness,
as to have a Prince that <HI>set∣ting
aside the formality of Laws</HI> would
vouchsafe to Govern them by the glo∣rious
Method of a <HI>Standing Army.—</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Testimonials</HI> were things not
much unlike <HI>our Addresses</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and
which when I heard, I could not but
remember our Case, in the time of the
late King <HI>James,</HI> when the City of <HI>Car∣lisle</HI>
in their Address, <HI>Thankt his Maje∣sty</HI>
for the Establishing a Standing Ar∣my
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
in <HI>England</HI> in time of Peace, calling it
the <HI>Strength, and Glory</HI> of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>So strong is the Ambition and Envy
of Parties, these <HI>Solunarian Gentlemen</HI> not
grudging to put out one of their own
Eyes, so they might at the same time put
out both the Eyes of their Enemies; the
<HI>Crolians</HI> rather consented to this badge
of their own Slavery, and brought
themselves who were a free People be∣fore,
under the Power and Slavery of
the Sword.</P>
<P>The ease with which this Prince got
over so considerable a Point as this, made
him begin to be too credulous, and to
perswade himself that the <HI>Solunarian
Church-Men</HI> were really in earnest, as
to their Pageant-Doctrin of <HI>Non Re∣sistance,</HI>
and that as he had seen them
bear with strange extravagancies on
the <HI>Crolian</HI> Part, they were real and
in earnest when they Preach'd that Men
ought to obey for Conscience's sake,
whatever hardship were impos'd upon
them, and however unjust, or contrary to
the Laws of God, Nature, Reason, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Country; what Principle in the
World could more readily prompt a
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
Prince to attempt what he so earnestly
coveted, as this zealous Prince did the
restoring the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Faith, for
since he had but two sorts of People to
do with; one he had crush'd by force,
and had brought the other to profess it
their <HI>Religion,</HI> their <HI>Duty,</HI> and their <HI>Re∣solution</HI>
to bear every thing he thought
fit to Impose upon them, and that they
should be <HI>Damn'd</HI> if they <HI>resisted,</HI> the
Work seem'd half done to his Hand.</P>
<P>And indeed when I reflected on the
Coherence of things, I could not so
much blame this Prince for his ventur∣ing
upon the probability, for whoever
was but to go up to this <HI>Lunar World</HI>
and read the Stories of that Time, with
what Fury the hot Men of the <HI>Soluna∣rian
Church</HI> acted against the <HI>Dissenting
Crolians,</HI> and with what warmth they as∣sisted
their Prince against them, and
how Cruelly they insulted them after
they were defeated in their attempt of
Dethroning him, how zealously they
Preach'd up the Doctrine of absolute
undisputed Resignation to his Will,
how frequently they obey'd several of
his encroachments upon their Liberties,
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
and what solemn Protestations they made
to submit to him in any thing, and to
stand by and assist him in <HI>whatever</HI> he
Commanded them to the <HI>last Drop,</HI>
much with the same Zeal and Forward∣ness,
as our <HI>Life-and-Fortune Men</HI> did
here in <HI>England.</HI> I say, when all this was
consider'd, I could not so much con∣demn
his Credulity, nor blame him for
believing them, for no Man could have
doubted their Sincerity, but he that at the
same time must have Taxt them with
<HI>most unexampled Hipocrisie.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Solunarians</HI> now began to
discern their Prince was not really on
their side, that neither in State Mat∣ters
any more than Religion, he had
any affection for them, and the first ab∣solute
Shock he gave them, was in Pub∣lishing
a general Liberty to the <HI>Crolians.</HI>
'Tis true this was not out of respect to
the <HI>Crolian</HI> Religion any more than the
<HI>Solunarian,</HI> but purely because by that
means he made way for an Introduction
of the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Religion which now
began to appear publickly in the Coun∣try.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="144"/>
But however, as this was directly con∣trary
to the expectation of the <HI>Soluna∣rians,</HI>
it gave them such a disgust against
their Prince, that from that very time
being disappointed in the Soveraign Au∣thority
they expected, they entred into
the deepest and blackest Conspiracy a∣gainst
their Prince and his Government
that ever was heard of.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Crolians</HI> were deluded
by the new Favour and Liberty they
receiv'd from the Prince to believe him
real, and were glad of the Mortification
of their Brethren; but the more Judici∣ous
seeing plainly the Prince's Design,
<HI>declar'd against their own Liberty,</HI> because
given them by an illegal Authority,
without the assent of the whole Body
legally assembled.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Solunarians</HI> saw this they
easily reconcil'd themselves to the <HI>Croi∣lians,</HI>
at least from the Outside of the
Face, for the carrying on their Design,
and so here was a Nation full of Plots,
here was the Prince and his <HI>Abrogratzi∣ans</HI>
plotting to introduce their Religion,
here was a parcel of blind short-sighted
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
<HI>Crolians</HI> plotting to ruin the <HI>Solunarian
Establishment,</HI> and weakly joining with
the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> to satisfy their private
Resentments; and here was the <HI>wiser
Crolians</HI> joining heartily with the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
of all sorts, laying aside private
Resentments, and forgetting old Grudges
about Religion, in order to ruin the in∣vading
Projects of the Prince and his
Party.</P>
<P>There was indeed some verbal Condi∣tions
past between them, and the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
willing to bring them into their
Party promised them upon the Faith of
their Nation, and the Honour of the
<HI>Solunarian Religion,</HI> that there should be
no more Hatred, Disturbance <HI>or Perse∣cution</HI>
for the sake of Religion between
them, but that they would come to a
Temper with them, and always be Bre∣thren
for the future. They declared
that <HI>Persecution was contrary to their Reli∣gion
in general, and to their Doctrin in par∣ticular;</HI>
and backt their Allegations
with some Truths they have not since
thought fit <HI>to like,</HI> nor much <HI>to regard.</HI></P>
<P>However by this Artifice, and on
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
these Conditions, they brought the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
to join with them in their Resolu∣tions
to countermine their designing
Prince; these indeed were for doing it
by the old way down-right, and to op∣pose
Oppression with Force, a Doctrin
they acknowledg'd, and profest to join
with all the <HI>Lunar</HI> part of Mankind in
the practice, and began to tell their Bre∣thren
how they had impos'd upon them∣selves
and the World, in pretending to
absolute Submission against Nature and
<HI>universal Lunarian Practice.</HI></P>
<P>But a cunning Fellow personating a
<HI>Solunarian,</HI> and who was in the Plot,
<HI>gravely answer'd them thus,</HI> “Look ye,
Gentlemen, we own with you that
<HI>Nature, Reason, Law, Justice,</HI> and <HI>Cu∣stom
of Nations</HI> is on your side, and that
all Power <HI>Derives</HI> from, <HI>Centers</HI> in,
and on all Recesses or Demises of
Power <HI>returns</HI> to its Great Original the
<HI>Party Governed:</HI> Nay we own our
<HI>Great Eye</HI> from whom all the habitable
Parts of this Globe are inlightned, has
always directed us to practise what
Nature thns dictates, always approv'd
and generally succeeded the attempt of
Dethroning Tyrants. But our Case
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
differs, <HI>we have always pretended to this
absolute undisputed Obedience,</HI> which we
did indeed to gain the Power of your
Party; and if we should turn round at
once to your Opinion, tho' never so
right, we should so fly in the Face of
our own Doctrin, <HI>Sermons,</HI> innumera∣ble
<HI>Pamphlets</HI> and <HI>Pretensions,</HI> as would
give all our Enemies too great a Power
over us in Argument, and we should
never be able to look Mankind in the
Face: But we have laid our Measures
so that by prompting the King to <HI>run
upon us</HI> in all sorts of bare-fac'd Ex∣treams
and Violences, we shall bring
him to exasperate the whole Nation;
then we may underhand foment the
breach on this side, raise the Mob upon
him, and by acting on both sides seem
to suffer a Force in falling in with the
People, and preserve our Reputation.”</P>
<P>“Thus we shall bring the thing to
pass, <HI>betray our Prince,</HI> take Arms <HI>a∣gainst
his Power,</HI> call in <HI>Foreign Force</HI> to
do the Work, and even then keep our
Hands seemingly out of the Broil, by
being pretended Sticklers for our for∣mer
Prince; so save our Reputation,
<PB N="144" REF="148"/>
and bring all to pass with Ease and
Calmness; while the eager Party of
the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> will do their own
Work by expecting we will do it for
them.”</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians</HI> astonish'd both at the
Policy, the Depth, the Knavery and
the Hypocrisy of the Design, left them
to carry it on, owning it was a Master∣piece
of Craft, and so stood still to ob∣serve
the Issue, which every way an∣swer'd the exactness of its Contrivance.</P>
<P>When I saw into the bottom of all this
Deceit, I began to take up new Resoluti∣ons
of returning back into <HI>our Old World
again,</HI> and going home to <HI>England,</HI> where
tho' I had conceiv'd great Indignation at
the Treatment our <HI>Passive Obedience Men</HI>
gave their Prince here, and was in hopes
in these my remote Travels to have
found out some Nations of Honour and
Principles. I was fill'd with Amaze∣ment
to see our <HI>Moderate Knaves</HI> so
much <HI>out-done,</HI> and I was inform'd that
all these things were meer Amusements,
Vizors, and Shams, to bring an Inno∣cent
Prince into the Snare.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="149"/>
Would any Mortal imagin who has
read this short Part of the Story, that
all this was <HI>a Solunarian Church Plot,</HI> a
meer Conspiracy between these Gen∣tlemen
and the <HI>Crolian Dissenters,</HI> only
to wheedle in the unhappy Prince to
his own Destruction, and bring the po∣pular
Advantage of the Mob, to a
greater Ascendant on the Crown.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Richlieus, Mazarines, Gon∣damours,
Oliver Cromwels,</HI> and the whole
Train of Polititians that our World has
produc'd, the greatest of their Arts are
Follies to the unfathomable depth of these
<HI>Lunarian Policies;</HI> and for <HI>Wheedle, Lying,
Swearing, Preaching, Printing,</HI> &amp;c. what
is said in our World by <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Poli∣titians,</HI>
we thank God <HI>may be believ'd;</HI>
but if ever I believe a <HI>Solunarian Priest</HI>
Preaching Non-Resistance of Monarchs,
or a <HI>Solunarian Polititian</HI> turning <HI>Abro∣gratzian,</HI>
I ought to be mark'd down
for a Fool; nor will ever any Prince in
that Country take their Word again,
if ever they have their Senses about 'em,
but as this is a most extraordinary
Scene, so I cannot omit a more particu∣lar
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
and sufficient Relation of some Parts
of it, than I us'd to give.</P>
<P>The <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI> had carry'd on
their Non-Resistance Doctrin to such Ex∣termities,
and had given this new Prince
such unusual demonstrations of it, that
he fell absolutely <HI>into the Snare,</HI> and en∣tirely
believ'd them; he had try'd them
with such Impositions as they would
never have born from any Prince in the
World, nor from him neither, had they
not had a deep Design, and consequent∣ly
stood in need of the deepest Disguise
imaginable; they had yielded to a <HI>Stand∣ing
Army,</HI> and applauded it as a thing
they had desir'd; they had submitted to
<HI>levying Taxes</HI> upon them by <HI>New Methods,</HI>
and illegal Practices; they had yielded to
the abrogation or suspension at least of
their Laws, when the King's absolute
Will requir'd it; not that they were
blind, and did not see what their Prince
was doing, but that the black Design
was so deeply laid, they found it was
the only way to ruin him, to push him
upon the highest Extreams, and then
they should have their turn serv'd.—Thus
if he desir'd one illegal Thing of
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>
them, they would immediately grant
two; one would have thought they had
read our Bible, <HI>and the Command, when a
Man takes away the Cloak, to give him the
Coat also.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this enough, but they seem'd
willing to admit of the publick Exer∣cise
of the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Religion in all
Parts; and when the Prince set it up
in his own Chappel, they suffered it to
be set up in their Cities, and Towns,
and the <HI>Abrogratzian Clergy</HI> began to be
seen up and down in their very Habits;
a thing which had never been permit∣ted
before in that Country, and which
the Common People began to be very
uneasy at: But still the <HI>Solunarian Clergy,</HI>
and all such of the Gentry, especially as
were in the Plot, by their Sermons,
printed Books, and publick Discourses,
carry'd on this high topping Notion of
absolute Submission, so that the People
were kept under, and began to submit
to all the impositions of the Prince.</P>
<P>These things were so acted to the
Life, that not only the Prince, but
none of his <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Counsellors
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>
could see the Snare, the Hook was fo
finely covered by the Church-Artificers,
and the Bait so delicious, that they all
swallow'd it with eagerness and delight.</P>
<P>But the Conspirators willing to make
a sure game of it, and not thinking the
King, or all his Counsellors would
drive on so fast as they would have
them, tho' they had already made a fair
Progress for the Time, resolv'd to play
home, and accordingly they persuade
their Prince, that they will not only
submit to his Arbitrary Will, in Matters
of State, and Government, but in Mat∣ters
of Religion; and in order to carry
this Jest on, <HI>one of the heads of their Po∣liticks,</HI>
and a Person of great Estem for
his Abilities in Matters of State, being
without question one of the ablest Heads
of all the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Nobility, <HI>pretended to
be converted,</HI> and turn'd <HI>Abrogratzian.</HI> This
immediately took as they desir'd, for the
Prince caress'd him, and entertain'd him
with all possible endearments, preferr'd
him to several Posts of Honour and Ad∣vantage,
always kept him near him,
consulted him in all Emergencies, took
him with him to the <HI>Abrogian</HI> Sacrifices,
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>
and he made no Scruple publickly to
appear there, and by these degrees and
a <HI>super-achitophalian</HI> Hypocrisie, so in∣sinuated
himself into the credulous
Prince's favour, that he became his only
Confident, and absolute Master of all
his Designs.</P>
<P>Now the Plot had its desir'd effect,
for he push'd the King upon all manner
of Precipitations; and if even the <HI>Abro∣gratzians</HI>
themselves who were about
the King, interpos'd for more <HI>temperate
Proceedings,</HI> he would call them Cow∣ards,
Strangers, ignorant of the Tem∣per
of the <HI>Lunarians,</HI> who when they
were a going, might be driven, but if
they were suffered to cool and consider,
would face about and fall off.</P>
<P>Indeed the Men of Prudence and E∣states
among his own Party, I mean the
<HI>Abrogratzians</HI> in the Country, frequent∣ly
warn'd him to take more <HI>moderate
Measures,</HI> and to proceed with more
Caution; told him he would certainly
ruin them all, and himself, and that
there must be some Body about his Ma∣jesty
that push'd him upon these Ex∣tremes,
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>
on purpose to set all the Nation
in a Flame, and to overthrow all the
good Designs, which with Temper and
good Conduct, might be brought to
Perfection.</P>
<P>Had these wary Councils been ob∣serv'd,
and a Prudence and Policy agree∣able
to the mighty consequence of Things
been practis'd, the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> had
run a great risque of being over thrown,
and to have sunk gradually in the <HI>Abro∣gian
Errors,</HI> the People began to be drawn
off gradually, and the familiarity of the
thing made it appear less frightful to un∣thinking
People, who had entertain'd
strange Notions of the monstrous things
that were to be seen in it, so that com∣mon
Vogue had fill'd the Peoples Minds
with ignorant Aversions, that 'tis no ab∣surdity
to say, I believe there was 200000
People who would have spent the last
drop of their Blood against <HI>Abrogratzian∣ism,</HI>
that did not know whether it was a
<HI>Man or a Horse.</HI></P>
<P>This thing consider'd well, would
of it self have been sufficient to have
made the Prince and his Friends <HI>wary,</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
and to have taught them to suit
their Measures to the Nature and Cir∣cumstances
of Things before them; but
<HI>Success in their beginnings</HI> blinded their
Eyes, and they fell into this <HI>Church
Snare</HI> with the most unpitied willingness
that could be imagin'd.</P>
<P>The first thing therefore this new
Counsellor put his Master upon, in or∣der
to the beginning his more certain
Ruin, was to introduce several of his
<HI>Abrograzians</HI> into Places of all kinds,
both in the <HI>Army, Navy, Treasure,</HI> and <HI>Civil
Affairs,</HI> tho' contrary to some of the ge∣neral
Constitutions of Government; he
had done it into the <HI>Army</HI> before, tho'
it had disgusted several of his Military
Men, but now he push'd him upon
making it Universal, and still the <HI>Passive
Solunarians</HI> bore it with patience.</P>
<P>From this tameness and submission,
his next Step was to argue that he might
depend upon it the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI>
had so sincerely embrac'd the Doctrine
of <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> that they were now
ripen'd not only to sit still, and see their
Brethren the <HI>Crolians</HI> suppress'd, but to
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>
stand still and be opprest themselves,
and he might assure himself the Matter
was now ripe, he might do just what
he wou'd himself with them, they were
prepar'd to bare any thing.</P>
<P>This was the fatal Stroke, for having
possest the Prince with the belief of this,
he let loose the Reins to all his long
conceal'd Desires. Down went their
<HI>Laws,</HI> their <HI>Liberties,</HI> their <HI>Corporations,</HI>
their <HI>Churches,</HI> their <HI>Colleges,</HI> all went to
wreck, and the eager <HI>Abrograzians</HI>
thought the Day their own. The <HI>So∣lunarians</HI>
made no opposition, but what
was contain'd within the narrow cir∣cumference
of Petitions, Addresses,
<HI>Prayers, and Tears;</HI> and these the Prince
was prepar'd to reject, and upon all oc∣casions
to let them know he was <HI>re∣solv'd to be obey'd.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he drove on by the treacherous
Advice of his new Counsels, till he ri∣pen'd
all the Nation for the <HI>general De∣fection</HI>
which afterward follow'd.</P>
<P>For as the Encroachments of the
Prince push'd especially at their Church
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>
Liberties, and threatned the overthrow
of all their Ecclesiastical Privileges, the
Clergy no sooner began to feel that they
were like to be the first Sacrifice, but
they immediately threw off the Vizor,
and beat the <HI>Concionazimir;</HI> this is a
certain Eeclesiastick <HI>Engine</HI> which is u∣sual
in cases of general Alarm, as the
Churches Signal of <HI>Universal Tumult.</HI></P>
<P>This is truly a strange Engine, and
when a Clergy-Man gets into the In∣side
of it, and beats it, <HI>it Roars,</HI> and
makes such a terrible <HI>Noise</HI> from the se∣veral
Cavities, that 'tis heard a long
way; and there are always a competent
number of them plac'd in all Parts so
conveniently, that the Alarm is heard
all over the Kingdom in one Day.</P>
<P>I had some Thoughts to have given
the Reader a <HI>Diagram</HI> of this piece of
Art, but as I am but a bad Drafts Man,
I have not yet been able so exactly to
describe it, as that a Scheme can be
drawn, but to the best of my Skill, take
it as follows. 'Tis a <HI>hollow Vessel,</HI> large
enough to hold the biggest Clergy-Man
in the Nation; it is generally <HI>an Octogon</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
in Figure, <HI>open before,</HI> from the <HI>Wast</HI> up∣ward,
but whole <HI>at the Back,</HI> with <HI>a
Flat</HI> extended over it for <HI>Reverberation,</HI>
or doubling the Sound; <HI>doubling</HI> and <HI>re∣doubling,</HI>
being frequently thought ne∣cessary
to be made use of on these occa∣sions;
'tis very Mathematically con∣triv'd,
erected on <HI>a Pedestal of Wood</HI> like
a Windmil, and has a pair of winding
Stairs up to it, like those at the great
Tun at <HI>Hiedlebergh.</HI></P>
<P>I could make some <HI>Hierogliphical</HI> Dis∣courses
upon it, from these References,
thus. 1. That as it is erected on a Pe∣destal
like a Wind-Mill, so it is no new
thing for the Clergy, who are the only
Persons permitted to make use of it, to
make it <HI>turn round with the Wind,</HI> and
serve to all the Points of the Compass.
2. As the <HI>Flat</HI> over it assists to encrease
the Sound, by forming a kind of hollow,
or cavity proper to that purpose, so
there is a certain natural hollowness, or
emptiness, made use of sometimes in it,
by the Gentlemen of the Gown, which
serves exceedingly to the propogation of
all sorts of <HI>Clamour, Noise, Railing,</HI> and
<HI>Disturbance.</HI> 3. As the Stairs to it go
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
winding up like those by which one
mounts to the vast Tun of Wine at
<HI>Hiedlebergh,</HI> which has no equal in <HI>our
World,</HI> so the use made of these ascend∣ing
Steps, is not altogether different,
being frequently employ'd to raise Peo∣ple
up to all sorts of <HI>Enthusiasms,</HI> spiri∣tual
<HI>Intoxications,</HI> mad and <HI>evtravagant
Action,</HI> high exalted <HI>Flights, Precipita∣tions,</HI>
and all kinds of <HI>Ecclesiastick Drunk∣enness</HI>
and <HI>Excesses.</HI></P>
<P>The sound of this Emblem of empti∣ness,
the <HI>Concionazimir,</HI> was no sooner
heard over the Nation, but all the Peo∣ple
discover'd their readiness to <HI>join in</HI>
with the Summons, and as the thing had
been concerted before, they send over
their Messengers to demand Assistance
from a powerful Prince beyond the Sea,
one of their own Religion, and who was
allied <HI>by Marriage</HI> to the Crown.</P>
<P>They made their Story out so plain,
and their King had by the contrivance of
their <HI>Achitophel</HI> rendred himself so sus∣pected
to all his Neighbours, that this
Prince, without any hesitation, resolv'd
to join with them, and accordingly
makes vast Preparations to invade their
King.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="160"/>
During this interval their Behaviour
was quite altred at home, the Doctrin
of <HI>absolute Submission</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI>
was heard no more among them, the
<HI>Concionazimir</HI> beat daily to tell all the
People they should stand up to Defend
the Rights of the Church, and that it
was time to look about them for the
<HI>Abrograzians</HI> were upon them. The
eager Clergy made this <HI>Ecclesiastick En∣gine</HI>
sound as loud and make all the
Noise they could, and no Men in the
Nation were so forward as they to ac∣knowledge
that it was a State-Trick,
and they were drawn in to make such a
stir about the pretended Doctrins of <HI>ab∣solute
Submission,</HI> that they did not see
the Snare which lay under it, that now
their Eyes were opened, and they had
learnt to see the Power and Superiority
of Natural Right, and would be deceiv'd
no longer. <HI>Others</HI> were so honest to tell
the Truth, that they knew the empti∣ness
and weakness of the pretence all
along, and knew what they did when
they Preacht it up, <HI>viz. to suppress and
pull down the Crolians:</HI> But they thought
their Prince who <HI>they always</HI> serv'd in
crying up that Doctrin, and whose Ex∣clusion
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
was prevented by it, would ha'
had more Gratitude, or at least more
Sense, than to try the Experiment <HI>upon
them,</HI> since whatever to serve his De∣signs
and their own, <HI>which they always
thought well united,</HI> they were willing to
pretend, he could not but see they <HI>al∣ways
knew better</HI> than to suffer the pra∣ctice
of it in their own Case. That
since he had turn'd the Tables upon
them, 'tis true he had them at an ad∣vantage
and might pretend <HI>they were
Knaves,</HI> and perhaps had an opportunity
to call them so with some reason; but
they were resolv'd, since he had drove
them to the necessity of being one or
t'other, tho' he might call them Knaves,
they would take care he should have no
reason to <HI>call them Fools</HI> too.</P>
<P>Thus the Vapour of absolute Subje∣ction
was lost on a suddain, and as if it
had been preparatory to what was com∣ing
after, the Experiment was quickly
made; for the King persuing his En∣croachments
upon the Church, and be∣ing
possest with a Belief that pursuant
to their open Professions they would
submit to any thing, he made a begin∣ning
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>
with them, in sending his positive
Command to one of his Superintendent
Priests, or <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> to forbid a certain
Ecclesiastick to officiate any more till
his Royal Pleasure was known.</P>
<P>Now it happen'd <HI>very unluckily</HI> that
this Patriarch, tho' none of the most
Learned of his Fraternity, yet had al∣ways
been a mighty zealous Promoter
of this blind Doctrin of <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI>
and had not a little triumph'd over and
insulted the <HI>Crolian Dissenters</HI> upon the
Notion of <HI>Rebellion,</HI> antimonarchical
Principles and Obedience, with a reserve
for the Laws, and the like, as a scanda∣lous
practice, and comprehensive of Fa∣ction,
Sedition, dangerous to the
Church and State, and the like.</P>
<P>This Reverend Father was singl'd out
as the first Mark of the King's Design:
the <HI>deluded Prince</HI> believ'd he could not
but comply, having so publickly pro∣fest
his being <HI>all Submission</HI> and <HI>absolute
Subjection;</HI> but as this was <HI>all Conceit,</HI>
he was pusht on to make the Assault
where he was most certain to meet a
repulse; and this Gentleman had long
<PB N="159" REF="163"/>
since thrown off the Mask, so his first
Order was disobey'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patriarch</HI> pretended to make
humble Remonstrances, and to offer his
Reasons why he could not in Consci∣ence,
<HI>as he call'd it,</HI> comply. The King,
who was now made but a meer Engine,
<HI>or Machine,</HI> screw'd up or down by this
false Counsellor to act his approaching
Destruction with his own Hand, <HI>was
prompted</HI> to resent this Repulse with the
utmost Indignation, to reject all manner
of Submissions, Excuses or Arguments, or
any thing but an immediate, absolute
compliance, according to the Doctrin so
often inculcated; and this he run on so
high, as to put <HI>the Patriarch in Prison</HI> for
Contumacy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patriarch</HI> as absolutely refus'd to
submit, and offer'd himself to the Deci∣sion
of the Law.</P>
<P>Now it was always a sacred Rule in
these <HI>Lunar Countries,</HI> that both <HI>King</HI>
and <HI>People</HI> are bound to stand by the ar∣bitrimnet
of <HI>the Law</HI> in all cases of
Right or Claim, whether publick or
<PB N="160" REF="164"/>
private; and this has been the reason
that all the Princes have endeavour'd to
cover their Actions with pretences of
Law, <HI>whatever really has been in their De∣sign;</HI>
for this reason the King could not
refuse to bring the Patriarch to a Tryal,
where the Humour of the People first
discover'd it self, for here <HI>Passive Obedi∣ence
was Try'd and Cast,</HI> the Law lrov'd
to be superior to the King, the Patriarch
<HI>was acquitted,</HI> his Disobedience to the
King <HI>justify'd,</HI> and the King's Command
<HI>Prov'd unjust.</HI></P>
<P>The Applause <HI>of the Patriarch,</HI> the
Acclamations of the People, and the ge∣neral
Rejoycings of the whole Nation at
this Transaction, gave a black prospect
to the <HI>Abrograzians;</HI> and a great many
of them came very honestly and humbly
to the King and told him, if he conti∣nued
to go on by these Measures he
would ruin them all; they told him
what general Alarm had been over the
whole Nation by the Clamours of the
Clergy; and the beating of the <HI>Conciona∣zimir</HI>
in all Parts, inform'd him how the
Doctrin of <HI>absolute Obedience</HI> was ridi∣cul'd
in all Places, and how the Clergy
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>
began to preach it back again <HI>like a
Witches Prayer,</HI> and that it would infal∣libly
raise the Devil of Rebellion in all
the Nation, they besought him to con∣tent
himself with the liberty of their
Religion, and the freedom they enjoy'd
of being let into Places and Offices of
Trust and Honour, and to wait all rea∣sonable
Occasions to encrease their Ad∣vantages,
and gradually to gain Ground;
they entreated him to consider the im∣possibility
of reducing so mighty, so ob∣stinate,
and so resolute a Nation all at
once. They pleaded how rational a
thing it was to expect that by Degrees
and good Management, which by pre∣cipitate
Measures would be endanger'd
and overthrown.</P>
<P>Had these wholsome Counsels taken
place in the King's Mind he had been
King to his last hour, and the <HI>Solunari∣ans</HI>
and <HI>Crolians</HI> too had been all un∣done,
for he had certainly incroach'd
upon them gradually, and brought that to
pass in time which by precipitant
Measures he was not likely to effect.</P>
<P>It was therefore a master-piece of Po∣licy
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
in the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Church-men to
place a feign'd Convert near their
Prince, who shou'd always biass him
with contrary Advices, puff him up
with vast prospect of Success, prompt
him to all Extreams, and always Fool
him with the certainty of bringing
Things to pass his own way.</P>
<P>These Arts made him set light by the
repulse he met with in the Matter of the
<HI>Patriarch,</HI> and now he proceeds to make
two Attacks more upon the Church;
one was by putting some of his <HI>Abrogra∣zian
Priests</HI> into <HI>a College</HI> among some of
the <HI>Solunarian Clergy;</HI> and the other was
to oblige all the <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI> to
read a certain Act of his Council, in
which his Majesty admitted all the <HI>Abro∣grazians,
Crolians,</HI> and all sorts of Dis∣senters,
to a freedom of their Religious
Exercises, <HI>Sacrifices, Exorcisms, Dippings,
Preachings,</HI> &amp;c. and to prohibit the <HI>So∣lunarians</HI>
To Molest or Disturb them.</P>
<P>Now as this last was a bitter reproach
to the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> for all the ill
Treatment the <HI>Dissenting Crolians</HI> had
receiv'd from them, and as it was ex∣prest
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
in the Act that all such Treatment
was Unjust and Unchristian, so for them
to read it in their Temples, was to ac∣knowledge
that they had been guilty of most
unjust and irreligious Dealings to
the <HI>Crolians,</HI> and that their Prince had
taken care to do them Justice.</P>
<P>The matter of introducing the <HI>Abro∣grazians</HI>
into the Colleges or Seminaries
of the <HI>Solunarian Priest,</HI> was actually a∣gainst
the Sacred Constitutions and
Foundation-Laws of <HI>those Seminaries.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore in both these Articles they
not only disobey'd their Prince, but they
oppos'd him with thofe <HI>trisling Things
call'd Laws,</HI> which they had before declar'd
had no Defensive Force against their
Prince; these they had recourse to now,
insisted upon the Justice and Right de∣volv'd
upon them by the Laws, and ab∣solutely
refus'd their compliance with
his Commands.</P>
<P>The Prince, pusht upon the Tenters
before, receiv'd their Denial with ex∣ceeding
Resentment, and was heard
with deep regret, to break out in Ex∣clamations
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
at their unexpected faithless
Proceedings, and sometimes to express
himself thus: <HI>Horrid Hypocrisy! Sur∣prizing
Treachery! Is this the absolute Sub∣jection
which in such numerous Testimonials
or Addresses you profest, and for which you
so often and so constantly branded the poor</HI>
Crolians, <HI>and told me that your Church
was wholly made up of Principles of Loyalty
and Obedience! But I'll be fully satisfied
for this Treatment.</HI></P>
<P>In the minute of one of those Excur∣sions
of his Passion, came into his Pre∣sence
the seemingly revolted <HI>Lunarian
Noble Man,</HI> and falling in with his pre∣sent
Passions, prompts him to a speedy
Revenge; and propos'd his erecting <HI>a
Court of Searches,</HI> something like the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Inquisition, giving them plenipo∣tentiary
Authority to hear and deter∣mine
all Ecclesiastical Causes absolute∣ly,
and without Appeal.</P>
<P>He empower'd these Judges to place
by his absolute Will, all the <HI>Abrograzian</HI>
Students in the <HI>Solunarian College,</HI> and
tho' they might make a formal Hearing
for the sake of the Form, yet that by
Force it should be done.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169"/>
He gave them Power to displace all
those <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI>-Men that had
refus'd to read his Act of Demission to
the <HI>Abrograzian, and Crolian Dissenters,</HI>
and 'twas thought he design'd to keep
their. Revenues in <HI>Petto,</HI> till he might
in time fill them up to some of his own
Religion.</P>
<P>The Commission accordingly began
to act, and discovering a full Resolution
to fulfil his Command, they by Force
proceeded with the Students of the <HI>So∣lunarian
College;</HI> and it was very re∣markable,
that even some of the <HI>Solu∣narian
Patriarchs</HI> were of this number,
who turn'd out their Brethren the <HI>Solu∣narian
Students,</HI> to place <HI>Abrograzians in
their room.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed they are said to have re∣pented
of since, but however, these it
seems were not of the Plot, and there∣fore
did not foresee what was at hand.</P>
<P>The rest of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> who were
all in the Grand Design, and saw things
ripening for its Execution, upon the
apprehension of this <HI>Court of Searches</HI> be∣ginning
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
with them, make an humble
Address to their Prince, containing the
Reasons why they could not comply
with his Royal Command—</P>
<P>The incens'd King upbraided them
with his having been told by them of
their absolute and <HI>unreserv'd Obedi∣ence,</HI>
and refusing their Submissions or
their Reasons, <HI>sent them all to Jail,</HI> and re∣solv'd
to have brought them before his
new <HI>High Court of Searches,</HI> in order, as
was believ'd, to have them all displac'd.</P>
<P>And now all began to be in a Flame,
the Sollicitations of the <HI>Solunarian Par∣ty,</HI>
having obtain'd powerful Relief A∣broad,
they began to make suitable pre∣parations
at Home. The Gentry and
Nobility who the Clergy had brought
to join with them, furnish'd themselves
with Horses and Arms, and prepar'd with
their Tenants and Dependants to join
the Succours as soon as they should Arrive.</P>
<P>In short, the Forreign Troops they
had procur'd, Arriv'd, Landed, and
publish'd a long Declaration of all the
Grievances which they came to redress.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171"/>
No sooner was this Forreign Army
arriv'd with the Prince at the head of
them, but the face of Affairs <HI>altred on a
suddain.</HI> The King indeed, like a brave
Prince, drew all his Forces together,
and marching out of his Capital City,
advanc'd above 500 <HI>Stages,</HI> things <HI>they
measure Land with in those Countries,</HI> and
much about <HI>our Furlong,</HI> to meet his E∣nemy.</P>
<P>He had a gallant Army well appointed
and furnish'd, and all things much supe∣rior
to his Adversary, but alas the Poison
of Disobedience was gotten in there, and
upon the first <HI>March</HI> he offer'd to make to∣wards
the Enemy one of <HI>his great Captains</HI>
with a strong Party of his Men went over
and revolted.</P>
<P>This Example was applauded all over
the Nation, and by this time one of the Pa∣triarchs,
even the same mention'd before
that had so often preacht Non-Resistance
of Princes, lays by his Sacred Vestments,
Mitre, and Staff, and exchanging his
Robes for a Soldier's Coat, mounts on
Horseback, and in short, appears in Arms
against his Lord.—Nor was this all,
but the <HI>Treacherous Prelate</HI> takes along
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>
with him several <HI>Solunarian Lords,</HI> and
Persons of the highest Figure, and of
The Houshold, and Family of the King,
and with him went the King's own
Daughter, his principle Favourites and
Friends.</P>
<P>At the News of this, the poor de∣serted
Prince lost all Courage, and a∣bandoning
himself to Despair, he causes
his Army to retreat without fighting
a Stroke, quits them and the Kingdom
at once, and takes Sanctuary with such
as could escape with him, in the Court
of a Neighbouring Prince.</P>
<P>I have heard this Prince exceedingly
blam'd, for giving himself up to Des∣pair
so soon.—That he thereby a∣bandon'd
the best and faithfullest ot his
Friends, and Servants, and left them
to the Mercy of the <HI>Solunarians;</HI> that
when all those that would have forsak∣en
him were gone, he had Forces e∣qual
to his Enemies; that his Men were
in Heart, fresh and forward; that he
should have stood to the last; retreated
to a strong Town, where his Ships rod,
and which was over against the Terri∣tories
of his great Allie, to whom he
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>
might have deliver'd up the Ships which
were there, and have thereby made him
Superior at Sea to his Enemies, and he
was already much Superior at Land;
that there he might have been reliev'd
with Forces too strong for them to
match, and at least might have put it
to the Issue of a fair Battle.—Others,
that he might have retreated to his own
Court, and capital City, and taking
possession of the Citadel, which was his
own, might so have aw'd the Citizens
who were infinitely Rich, and Nume∣rous,
with the apprehensions of having
their Houses burnt, they would not
have dar'd to have declar'd for his Ene∣mies,
for fear of being reduc'd to heaps
and ruins; and that at last he might
have set the City on Fire in 500 Places,
and left the <HI>Solunarian Church-Men</HI> a
Token to remember their <HI>Non-Resisting
Doctrine by,</HI> and yet have made an easy
Retreat down the Harbour, to other
Forts he had below, and might with
ease have destroy'd all the Shipping
as he went.</P>
<P>'Tis confess'd had he done either, or
both these things, he had left them a
dear bought Victory, but he was de∣priv'd
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>
of his Counsellor, for as soon
as things came to this height, <HI>the Achi∣tophel</HI>
we have so often mention'd, <HI>left
him also,</HI> and went away; all his <HI>Abrogra∣zian
Priests too forsook him,</HI> and he was
so berest of Counsel that he fell into
the Hands of his Enemies as he was
making his escape, but he got away a∣gain,
not without the connivance of
the Enemy, who were willing enough
he should go; so he got a Vessel to car∣ry
him over to the Neighbouring King∣dom,
and all his Armies, Ships, Forts,
Castles. Magazines, and Treasure, fell
into his Enemies Hands.</P>
<P>The Neighbouring Prince entertain'd
him very kindly, Cherish'd him, Suc∣cour'd
him, and furnish'd him with Ar∣mies
and Fleets for the recovery of his
Dominions, which has occasion'd a te∣dious
War with that Prince, which con∣tinues
to this Day.</P>
<P>Thus far <HI>Passive Doctrins,</HI> and Abso∣lute
Submission serv'd a Turn, <HI>bubl'd the
Prince,</HI> wheedled him in to take their
Word who profess'd it, 'till he laid his
Finger upon the Men themselves, and
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
that unravell'd all the Cheat; they
were the first that call'd in Forreign
Power, and took up Arms against their
Prince.</P>
<P>Nor did they end here, but all this
Scene being over, and the Forreign
Prince having thus deliver'd them, and
their own King being thus chac'd away,
the People call themselves together, and
<HI>as Reason good,</HI> having been deliver'd
by him from the Miseries, Brangles,
Oppressions, and Divisions of the for∣mer
Reign, they thought they could do
no less than to Crown their Deliverer;
and having Summon'd a general As∣sembly
of all their <HI>Capital Men,</HI> they
gave the Crown to this Prince who had
so generously sav'd them.</P>
<P>And here again, I heard the first
King exceedingly blam'd for quitting
his Dominions, for had he staid here,
tho' he had actually been in their Hands,
unless they wou'd have Murther'd him,
they could never have proceeded to the
Extremeties they did reach to, nor cou'd
they ever have Crown'd the other
Prince, he being yet alive, and in his
own Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="176"/>
But by quitting the Country, they
fix'd a legal Period to their Obedience,
he having deserted their Protection, and
Defence, and openly laid down the Ad∣ministration.</P>
<P>But as these sort of Politicks cannot be
decided by us, unless we know the Con∣stitutions
of those <HI>Lunar Regions,</HI> so we can∣not
pretend to make a Decision of what
might, or might not have happen'd.</P>
<P>It remains to examine how those <HI>So∣lunarians</HI>
behav'd themselves, who had
so earnestly cryed up the Principles of
Obedience, and absolute Submission.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing was so Ridiculous,</HI> now they
saw what they had done, they began
to repent, and upon recollection of
Thoughts some were so asham'd of
themselves, that having broken their
Doctrin, and being now call'd upon to
transpose their Allegiance, truly they
stopt in the mid-way, and <HI>so became Mar∣tyrs
on both sides.</HI></P>
<P>I can liken these to nothing so well
to those Gentlemen of our <HI>English
<PB N="173" REF="177"/>
Church,</HI> who tho' they broke into the
Principles of Passive Obedience by joining,
and calling over the P. of <HI>O.</HI> yet suffer'd
deprivations of Benefices, and loss of their
Livings, <HI>for not taking the Oath;</HI> as if
they had not as <HI>effectually perjur'd them∣selves</HI>
by taking up Arms against their
King, and joyning a Forreign Power,
as they could possibly do afterward, by
Swearing to live quietly under the next
King.</P>
<P>But these nice Gentlemen are infi∣nitely
outdone in these Countries, for
these <HI>Solunarians</HI> by a true Church turn,
not only refuse to transpose their Alle∣giance,
but pretend to wipe their
Mouths as to former taking Arms, and
return to their old Doctrins of absolute
Submission, boast of Martyrdom, and
boldly reconcile the contraries of <HI>tak∣ing
up Arms,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> charg∣ing
all their Brethren with Schism, Re∣bellion,
Perjury, and the <HI>damnable Sin
of Resistance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor is this all,</HI> for as a great many
of these <HI>Solunarian Church</HI>-Men had no
affection to this new Prince, but were
<PB N="174" REF="178"/>
not equally furnish'd, or qualify'd for
Martyrdom with their Brethren; they
went to certain Wise Men, who being
cunning at <HI>splitting Hairs,</HI> and making
distinctions, might perhaps furnish them
with some mediums between Loyalty and
Disloyalty; they apply'd themselves with
great dilligence to these Men, and they
by deep Study, and long Search, <HI>either
found or made</HI> the quaintest Device for
them that ever was heard of.</P>
<P>By this unheard of Discovery, to their
great Joy and Satisfaction, they have
arriv'd at a Power, which all the Wise
Men in our World could never pretend
to, and which 'tis thought, could the
description of it be regularly made, and
brought down hither, would serve for
the Satisfaction and Repose of a great
many tender Consciences, who are ve∣ry
uneasy at <HI>Swearing to save their Bene∣fices.</HI></P>
<P>These great Masters of Distinction,
have learn't to distinguish between
<HI>active</HI> Swearing, and <HI>passive</HI> Swearing,
between <HI>de facto</HI> Loyalty, and <HI>de jure</HI>
Loyalty, and by this decent acquire∣ment
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
they obtained the Art of reconcil∣ing
<HI>Swearing Allegiance without Loyalty,</HI> and
<HI>Loyalty without Swearing,</HI> so that native
and original Loyalty may be preserv'd
pure and uninterrupted, in spight of all
<HI>subsequent Oaths, to prevailing Ʋsurpa∣tions.</HI></P>
<P>Many are the Mysteries, and vast the
Advantages of this new invented Me∣thod,
<HI>Mental Reservations, Inuendoes,</HI>
and Double Meanings <HI>are Toys to this,</HI>
for they may be provided for in the lit∣teral
terms of an Oath, but no Provi∣sion
can be made against this; for those
Men after they have taken the Oath,
make no Scruple to declare, <HI>they only
Swear to be quiet, as long as they can make
no Disturbance;</HI> that they are left at
liberty still to espouse the Interest and
Cause of their former Prince, they nice∣ly
distinguish between <HI>Obedience</HI> and
<HI>Submission,</HI> and tell you a <HI>Slave taken into
Captivity,</HI> tho' he Swears <HI>to live peaceably,</HI>
does not thereby renounce his <HI>Allegiance</HI>
to his natural Prince, nor abridge him∣self
of a Right to attempt his own Li∣berty
<HI>if ever opportunity present.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180"/>
Had these neat Distinctions been found
out before, none of our <HI>Solunarian Clergy,</HI>
no not the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> themselves surely
would have stood out, and suffer'd such
Depredations on their Fortunes and
characters as they did; they wou'd ne∣ver
have been such Fools to have been
turn'd out of their Livings for not
Swearing, when they might have learnt
here that they <HI>might have swore to one
Prince, and yet have retain'd their Allegi∣ance
to another;</HI> might have taken an
Oath to the new, without impeachment
of their old Oaths to the absent Prince.—<HI>It
is great pity these Gentlemen
had not gone up to the</HI> Moon <HI>for Instruction
in this difficult Case.</HI></P>
<P>There they might have met with ex∣cellent

Reasons, Dr. <HI>Overall,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI>
and all our nice Examiners of these
things wou'd appear to be no Body to
them; for as the People in these Regions
have an extraordinary <HI>Eye-sight,</HI> and the
clearness of the Air contributs much to
the help of their <HI>Opticks,</HI> so they have
without doubt a proportion'd clearness of
discerning, by which they see as tar <HI>in∣to

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
Mill-stones,</HI> and all sorts of Solids, as
the nature of things will permit, but a∣bove
all, their Faculties are blest with
two exceeding Advantages.</P>
<P>1. <HI>With an extraordinary distinguishing
Power,</HI> by which they can distinguish
<HI>even Indivisibles,</HI> part Unity it self, <HI>di∣vide
Principles,</HI> and <HI>distinguish Truth</HI> into
such and so many <HI>minute Particles,</HI> till
they dwindle it away into a very Nose
of Wax, and mould it into any Form
they have occasion for, by which means
they can distinguish themselves into or
out of any Opinion, either in Religion,
Politicks or Civil Right, that their pre∣sent
Emergencies may call for.</P>
<P>2. Their reasoning Faculties have this
further advantage, that upon occasion
<HI>they can see clearly for themselves,</HI> and <HI>pre∣vent
others from the same discovery,</HI> so
that when they have occasion to see any
thing which presents for their own Ad∣vantage,
they can search into the Parti∣culars,
make it clear to themselves, and
yet let it remain dark and mysterious to
all the World besides. Whether this is
perform'd by their exceeding Penetra∣tion,
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
or by casting an artificial Veil over
the Understandings of the Vulgar, <HI>Au∣thors
have not yet determin'd;</HI> but that the
Fact is true, admits of no Dispute.</P>
<P>And the wonderful Benefit of these
Things in point of Dispute is extraordi∣nary,
for they can see clearly they have
the better of an Argument, when all the
rest of the World think they have not
a Word to say for themselves: 'Tis plain
to them that this or that proves a thing,
when Nature, by common Reasoning,
knows no such Consequences.</P>
<P>I confess I have seen some weak At∣tempts
at this extraordinary. Talent,
particularly in the Disputes in <HI>England</HI>
between the <HI>Church and the Dissenter,</HI> and
between the <HI>High and Low Church,</HI>
wherein People have tollerably well
convinc'd themselves when no Body else
could see, any thing of the Matter, as
particularly the famous Mr. <HI>W—ly</HI> about
the <HI>Antimonarchical Principles taught in
the Dissenters Accademies; ditto</HI> in <HI>L</HI>—<HI>sly,</HI>
about the Dissenters <HI>burning the City,</HI>
and setting Fire to their own Houses to
destroy their Neighbours; and <HI>another
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
famous Author,</HI> who prov'd that <HI>Christo∣pher
Love</HI> lost his Head for attempting to
pull down Monarchy by restoring King
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>These indeed are some faint Resem∣blances
of what I am upon; but alas!
these are tender sort of People, that
han't obtain'd <HI>a compleat Victory over
their Consciences,</HI> but suffer <HI>that Trifle</HI> to
reproach them all the while they are do∣ing
it, to rebel against their resolv'd
Wills, and check them in the middle of
the Design; from which Interruptions
arise Palpitations of the Heart, Sickness
and squeamishness of Stomach; and
these have proceeded to <HI>Castings and Vo∣mit,</HI>
whereby they have been forc'd
sometimes to throw up some such un∣happy
Truths as have confounded all the
rest, and flown in their own Faces so
violently, as in spight of Custom has
made them blush and look downward;
and tho' in kindness to one another they
have carefully lickt up <HI>one anothers Filth,</HI>
yet this unhappy squeamishness of Sto∣mach
has spoil'd all the Design, and
turn'd the Appetites of their Party, to
the no small prejudice of a Cause that
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
stood in need of more Art and <HI>more Face</HI>
to carry it on as it shou'd be with a
thoro'-pac'd <HI>Case-harden'd Policy,</HI> such as
I have been relating, is compleatly ob∣tain'd
in these Regions, where the Arts
and Excellencies of sublime Reasonings
are carried up to all the extraordinaries
of <HI>banishing Scruples,</HI> reconciling Con∣tradictions,
<HI>uniting Opposites,</HI> and all the
necessary Circumstances requir'd in a
compleat Casuist.</P>
<P>'Tis not easily conceivable to what
extraordinary Flights they have carry'd
this strength of Reasoning, for besides
the distinguishing nicely between Truth
and Error, they obtain a most refin'd
Method of distinguishing <HI>Truth it self into
Seasons and Circumstances,</HI> and so can bring
any thing to be Truth, when it serves
the turn that happens just then to be
needful, and make the same thing to be
false at another time.</P>
<P>And this method of <HI>circumstantiating
Matters of Fact</HI> into Truth or Falshood,
suited to occasion, is found admirably
useful to the solving the most difficult
<HI>Phaenomena of State,</HI> for by this Art the
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
<HI>Solunarian Church</HI> made Persecution be
against their Principles at one time, and
reducible to Practice at another. They
made <HI>taking up Arms,</HI> and calling in
Foreign Power to depose their Prince,
<HI>consistent with Non-Resistance, and Passive
Obedience;</HI> nay they went farther, they
distinguisht between <HI>a Crolian</HI>'s taking
Arms, and <HI>a Solunarians,</HI> and fairly
prov'd this to be <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and that to
be <HI>Non-Resistance.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, and which exceeded all the Pow∣er
of human Art in the highest degrees
of Attainment that ever it arriv'd to
on <HI>our side the Moon;</HI> they turn'd the
Tables so dexterously, as to argument
upon one sort of <HI>Crolians,</HI> call'd <HI>Presta∣rians;</HI>
that tho' they repented of the
War they had rais'd in former Times,
and protested against the violence offer'd
their Prince; and after another Party
had <HI>in spight of them</HI> Beheaded him, <HI>took
Arms</HI> against the <HI>other Party,</HI> and never
left contriving their Ruin, till they had
<HI>brought in his Son,</HI> and set him upon the
Throne again.</P>
<P>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by this most dextrous way of

<HI>Twisting, Extending, Contracting,</HI> and <HI>Di∣stingu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing</HI>
of Phrases and Reasoning,
they presently made it as plain as the
Sun at Noon Day; that these <HI>Prestari∣ans</HI>
were <HI>King-killers,</HI> Common-wealths
Men, <HI>Rebels,</HI> Traytors and <HI>Enemies to
Monarchy;</HI> that they <HI>restor'd</HI> the Monar∣chy

the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> This was prov'd so plain by
these <HI>sublime Distinctions,</HI> that they con∣vinc'd
themselves and their Posterity of

found out <HI>by extraordinary Study,</HI> which
proves the wonderful power of <HI>Custom,</HI>
insomuch, that let any Man by this

all his life after.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Prestarians</HI> were call'd the
Murtherers of <HI>the Father,</HI> tho' they re∣stor'd
<HI>the Son,</HI> and all the Testimonials
of their Sufferings, Protests and Insur∣rections
to prevent his Death, <HI>signify'd

has that powerful Charm in it, that all
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
<HI>those Trifles</HI> we call Proofs and Demon∣stration
were of no use in that Case.
<HI>Custom</HI> brought the Story up to a Truth,

Parties in the Crime.</P>
<P>Now as it happen'd at last that these
<HI>Solunarian Gentlemen</HI> found it necessary
to <HI>do the same thing themselves,</HI> viz. To
lay aside their Loyalty, <HI>Depose, Fight</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst, <HI>shoot Bullets</HI> at, and throw Bombs
<HI>at their King</HI> till they frighted him away,
and <HI>sent him abroad to beg his Bread.</HI> The
<HI>Crolians</HI> began to take Heart and tell
them, now they ought <HI>to be Friends with
them,</HI> and tell them no more of <HI>Rebel∣lion</HI>
and <HI>Disloyalty;</HI> nay, they carry'd it
so far as to challenge them to bring <HI>their
Loyalty to the Test,</HI> and compare
<HI>Crolian Loyalty</HI> and <HI>Solunarian Loyalty</HI> to∣gether,
and see who had <HI>rais'd more
Wars,</HI> taken up Arms <HI>oftenest,</HI> or ap∣pear'd
in <HI>most Rebellions</HI> against their

the <HI>Crolians</HI> or the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> for there

Men</HI> under their new Prince, and the
Armies of Foreign Succours under <HI>their
old King,</HI> in which their <HI>old King</HI> was
beaten and forc'd to flie a second time,
the <HI>Crolians</HI> told them that every Bul∣let
they shot at the Battle was as much
<HI>a murthering their King,</HI> as cutting off
the Head <HI>with a Hatche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was a killing
his Father.</P>
<P>These Arguments in our World would

<P><HI>When I saw this,</HI> I really bewail'd the

<P>By this they might have attained suit∣able
reserves of Argument to distinguish
themselves <HI>out of their Loyalty,</HI> and <HI>into
their Loyalty,</HI> as occasion presented to
dismiss <HI>this</HI> Prince, and entertain <HI>that,</HI>
as they found it to their purpose; but
above all, they might have learnt a way
how to justify <HI>Swearing</HI> to one King and
<HI>Praying</HI> for another, <HI>Eating</HI> one Prince's
Bread and <HI>doing</HI> another Prince's <HI>Work,
Serving</HI> one King they don't <HI>Love</HI> and
<HI>Loving</HI> another they don't <HI>Serve;</HI> they
might easily reconcile the Schisms of the
Church, and prove they are still Loyal
Subjects <HI>to King James,</HI> while they are
only forc'd Bonds-Men to the <HI>Act of Set∣tlement,</HI>
for the sake of that comforta∣ble
Importance, call'd <HI>Food and Rai∣ment;</HI>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnish'd</HI> and blur'd, with the malicious

Attacks of <HI>the Whigs</HI> on one Hand, and
the <HI>Non-Jurants</HI> on the other.</P>
<P><HI>These</HI> Tax them as above with Re∣bellion
by their own Principles, and
contradicting the Doctrin of <HI>Passive Sub∣mission</HI>
and Non-Resistance, by taking
up Arms against their Prince, calling in
a <HI>Foreign Power,</HI> and deposing him:
They charge them with killing the

and breakers off from the general

<P>'Tis confest all <HI>the Answers</HI> they have

<HI>very weak</HI> and <HI>mean,</HI> unworthy Men of

Communication of these <HI>Lunar Argu∣ments</HI>
and <HI>Distinctions,</HI> without which,
and till they can obtain which, a <HI>Conform∣ing

in Nature; a thing that ad∣mits
of no manner of Defence, no, not
by the <HI>People themselves,</HI> and which they
would willingly abandon, but that they
can find no side to join with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dissenting Jacobites</HI> have some
Plea for themselves, for let their Opini∣on
be never so repugnant to their Own
Interest, or general Vague, they are
<HI>faithful to some thing,</HI> and they wont
joyn with these People, because they
have <HI>Perjur'd their Faith,</HI> and yet pre∣tend
to adhere to it at the same time.
The <HI>Conforming Whigs</HI> won't receive
them, because they pretend to rail at
the Government they have Sworn to,

Sworn against; so that these <HI>poor Crea∣tures</HI>

is <HI>to go along with me,</HI> next time I Travel

<P>But as this is a very long Digression,
and for which I am to beg my Reader's
Pardon, being an Error I slipt into from
my abundant respect to these Gentle∣men,
and for their particular Instru∣ction,
I shall endeavour to make my

to my Subject.</P>
<P>To return therefore to the Historical
part of the <HI>Solunarian Church-Men,</HI> in
<HI>the World in the Moon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="195"/>
Having as is related <HI>Depos'd their
King,</HI> and plac'd the Crown upon the
Head of the Prince that came to their
assistance, a new Scene began all over
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>1. <HI>A terrible and bloody War</HI> began
thro' all the parts of the <HI>Lunar World,</HI>
where their banish'd Prince and his new
Allie had any Interest; and the new
King having a universal Character over
all the Northern Kingdoms of the Moon,
he brought in a great many Potent
<HI>Kings, Princes, Emperors</HI> and <HI>States,</HI> to
take part with him, and so it became
the most general War that had hap∣pen'd
in those Ages.</P>
<P>I did not trouble my self to enquire
into the particular Successes <HI>of this War,</HI>
but at what had a more particular re∣gard
to the Country from whence I
came, and <HI>for whose Instruction</HI> I have
design'd <HI>these Sheets,</HI> the Strife <HI>of Parties,</HI>
the Internal Feuds at home, and their
<HI>Analogy to ours,</HI> and whatever is instru∣ctively
to be▪ deduced from them, was
the Subject of immediate Inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196"/>
No sooner was this Prince plac'd on
the Throne, but according to his Pro∣mises
to them that invited him over, he
conven'd the Estates of the Realm, and
giving them free Liberty to <HI>make, alter,
add</HI> or <HI>repeal,</HI> all such Laws as they
thought fit, it must be <HI>their own fault</HI>
if they did not Establish themselves up∣on
such Foundation of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and
<HI>Right,</HI> as they desir'd; for he gave them
their <HI>full Swing,</HI> never interpos'd <HI>one
Negative</HI> upon them for several Years,
and let them do almost every thing they
pleas'd.</P>
<P>This <HI>full Liberty</HI> had like to have
spoil'd all, for as is before noted, this
Nation had <HI>one unhappy Quality</HI> they
could never be broke of, always to <HI>be
falling out</HI> one among another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians,</HI> according to Capitulati∣on,
demanded the full Liberty and Tole∣ration
of Religion, which the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
had condition'd with them for, when the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew them off from joyning with the
<HI>old King,</HI> and when they promis'd to
come <HI>to a Temper,</HI> and to <HI>be Brethren <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Peace and Love ever after.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197"/>
Nor were the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Church-Men
backward, either to remember,
or perform the Conditions but by the
consent of the King, who had been by
agreement made <HI>Guarantee of their for∣mer
Stipulations,</HI> an Act was drawn up
in full Form, and as compleat, as
both satisfy'd the desires of the <HI>Crolians,</HI>
and testify'd the Honesty and Probity of
the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> as they were abstracted∣ly
and <HI>moderately</HI> consider'd.</P>
<P>During the whole Reign of this King,
this <HI>Ʋnion of Parties</HI> continu'd without
any considerable Interruption, there was
indeed <HI>brooding Mischiefs</HI> which hovered
over every accident, in order to <HI>generate
Strife,</HI> but the Candor of the Prince,
and the Prudence of his Ministers, kept
it under for a long time.</P>
<P>At last an occasion offer'd it self, which
gave an unhappy Stroke to the Nation's
Peace. The King thro' <HI>innumerable Ha∣zards,</HI>
terrible <HI>Battles</HI> and <HI>a twelve Years
War,</HI> had reduc'd his powerful Adver∣sary
to such a necessity of Peace, that
he became content to abandon <HI>the fu∣gitive
King,</HI> and to own the Title of this
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
Warlike Prince; and upon these, among
various other Conditions, <HI>very Honour∣able
for him,</HI> and his Allies, and by which
vast Conquests were surrendred, and
<HI>disgorg'd to the Losers,</HI> a Peace was made
to the Universal Satisfaction of all those
Parts of <HI>the Moon</HI> that had been in∣volv'd
in a tiresome and expensive
War.</P>
<P>This Peace was no sooner made, but
the Inhabitants of this unhappy Coun∣try,
according <HI>to the constant Practice</HI> of
the Place, fell out in the most horrid
manner among themselves, and with
the very Prince that had done all these
<HI>great things for them;</HI> and I cannot for∣get
how the Old Gentleman I had these
Relations from, being once deeply en∣gag'd
in Discourse with <HI>some Senators</HI> of
that Country, and hearing <HI>them reproach
the Memory of that Prince</HI> from whom
they <HI>receiv'd so much,</HI> and on the foot
of whose <HI>Gallantry</HI> and <HI>Merit</HI> the Con∣stitution
<HI>then subsisted,</HI> it put him into
some heat, and he told them to their
Faces that they were guilty both of
<HI>Murther and Ingratitude.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199"/>
I thought the Charge was very high,
but as they returned upon him, and Chal∣leng'd
him to make it out, he answer'd
he was <HI>ready to do it,</HI> and went on thus.</P>
<P>His Majesty, <HI>said he,</HI> left a quiet, re∣tir'd,
compleatly happy Condition, <HI>full
of Honour,</HI> belov'd of his Country, <HI>Val∣lu'd</HI>
and <HI>Esteem'd,</HI> as well <HI>as Fear'd</HI> by
his Enemies, to come over hither at
your own Request, to deliver you from
the Encroachments and Tyranny <HI>as you
call'd it,</HI> of your Prince.</P>
<P>Ever since he came hither, he has
been your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer <HI>Journy-Man,</HI> your <HI>Ser∣vant,</HI>
your <HI>Souldier of Fortune,</HI> he has
<HI>Fought</HI> for you, <HI>Fatigu'd</HI> and <HI>Harras'd</HI>
his Person, and <HI>rob'd himself</HI> of all his
Peace <HI>for you;</HI> he has been in a constant
Hurry, and run thro' <HI>a Million of Ha∣zards
for you;</HI> he has convers'd with
Fire and Blood, <HI>Storms at Sea,</HI> Camps
and Trenches ashore, and given himself
no rest for <HI>twelve Years,</HI> and all for <HI>your
Ʋse,</HI> Safety and Repose: In requital of
which, he has been always treated with
<HI>Jealousies</HI> and <HI>Suspitions,</HI> with <HI>Reproaches,</HI>
and <HI>Abuses of all Sorts,</HI> and on all Occa∣sions,
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
till the ungrateful Treatment of
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> eat into <HI>his very Soul,</HI>
tir'd it with serving <HI>an unthankful Na∣tion,</HI>
and absolutely <HI>broke his Heart;</HI> for
which reason I think him <HI>as much Mur∣ther'd</HI>
as his Predecessor was, <HI>whose Head
was cut off</HI> by his Subjects.</P>
<P>I could not when this was over, but
ask the <HI>Old Gentlemen,</HI> what was the
reason of his Exclamation, and how it
was the People treated their Prince up∣on
this occasion?</P>
<P>He told me it was a grievous Subject,
and a long one, and too long to rehearse,
but he would give me a short Abridg∣ment
of it; and not to look back into his
Wars, in which he was abominably ill
serv'd, <HI>his Subjects constantly ill treated
him</HI> in giving him Supplies <HI>too late,</HI> that
he cou'd not get into the Field, nor for∣ward
his Preparations <HI>in time</HI> to be rea∣dy
for his Enemies, who frequently were
ready to insult him in his Quarters.</P>
<P>By giving him <HI>sham Taxes</HI> and <HI>Funds,
that raised little or no Mony,</HI> by which he
having borrow'd Mony of his People
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
by Anticipation, the Funds not answer∣ing,
he contracted such <HI>vast, Debts</HI> as the
Nation <HI>could never Pay,</HI> which brought
the War <HI>into disrepute,</HI> sunk the Credit
of his Exchequer, and fill'd the Nation
with Murmurs and Complaint.</P>
<P><HI>By betraying his Counsel</HI> and well laid
Designs to his Enemies, <HI>selling their Na∣tive
Country to Foreigners,</HI> retarding their
Navies and Expeditions, till the Ene∣mies
were provided to receive them,
<HI>betraying their Merchants</HI> and Trade,
spending vast Sums to fit out Fleets,
<HI>just time enoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to go Abroad, and do
nothing, and then <HI>get Home again.</HI></P>
<P>But as these were too numerous Evils,
and too long to repeat, the particular
things he related to in his Discourse,
were these that follow.</P>
<P>There had been <HI>a hasty Peace</HI> conclud∣ed
with a furious and powerful Enemy,
the King <HI>foresaw it would be of no continn∣uace,</HI>
and that the demise of a neighbour∣ing
King, who by all appearance could not
live long, would certainly embroil them
again.—He saw that Prince keep up
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
numerous Legions of Forces, in order
to be in a posture to break the Peace
with advantage. This the King fairly
represented to them, and told them the
necessity of keeping up <HI>such a Force,</HI> and
for such a Time, at least as might be
necessary to awe the Enemy from put∣ting
any affront upon them in case of
the Death of that Prince; which they
daily expected.</P>
<P>The Party who had all along malign'd
the Prosperity of this Prince, <HI>took fire
at the Offer,</HI> and here began another
State Plot, which tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hookt in two
or three sets of Men for different Ends,
yet altogether join'd in affronting and
ill treating their Prince, upon this Ar∣ticle
of the Army.</P>
<P><HI>The Nation had been in danger enough</HI>
from the designs of former Princes invad∣ing
their Priviledges, and putting them∣selves
in a Posture to Tyrannize by the
help <HI>of standing Forces,</HI> and the Party
that first took: Fire at this Proposal tho'
the very same Men who in the time of an
<HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Prince, were for caressing
him, and <HI>giving him thanks for his Stand∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
Army,</HI> as has been noted before,
were the very People that began the
outcry against this Demand, and <HI>so
specious were the Pretences</HI> they made, that
they drew in the very <HI>Crolians themselves</HI>
upon the pretence of Liberty, and Ex∣emption
from Arbitrary Methods of
Government <HI>to oppose their King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It griev'd this good Prince</HI> to be sus-pected
of Tyrannick Designs, and that
by a Nation who he had done so much,
and ventur'd so far to save <HI>from Tyranny,
and Standing Armies;</HI> 'twas <HI>in vain</HI> he
represented to them the pressing occasi∣on,
<HI>in vain</HI> he gave them a Description
of <HI>approaching Dangers,</HI> and the threat∣ning
posture of the Enemies Armies;
<HI>in vain</HI> he told them of the probabilities
of renewing the War, and how keeping
but a <HI>needful Force</HI> might be a means of
preventing it; <HI>in vain</HI> he propos'd the
subjecting what Force should be neces∣sary
to the Absolute Power, both as to
Time and Number of their own <HI>Corte <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
or <HI>National Assembly.</HI></P>
<P>It was all one, the Design being form'd
in the Breasts of those who were <HI>neither.
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
Friends to the Nation, nor the King,</HI> those
Reasons which would have been of
Force in another Case, made them the
more eager; <HI>bitter Reflections were made
on the King,</HI> and scurrilous Lampoons
publish'd upon the Subject of Tyrants,
and Governing by Armies.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more ungrateful to
<HI>a generous prince,</HI> nor could any thing
more deeply affect this King, <HI>than
whom</HI> none ever had a more <HI>genuine, sin∣gle-hearted
Design for the Peoples good,</HI> but
above all, like Caesar in the Case of <HI>Bru∣tus,</HI>
it heartily mov'd him to find him∣self
push'd at by those very People whom
he had all along seen, pretending to ad∣here
to <HI>his Interest</HI> and the <HI>Publick Be∣nefit,</HI>
which he had always taken care
should <HI>never be parted,</HI> and to find these
People join against this Proposal, <HI>as a
Design against their Liberties,</HI> and as a
Foundation of Tyranny <HI>heartily and sen∣sibly
afflicted him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was a strange Mistery,</HI> and not easily
unriddled, that those Men who had al∣ways
a known a version to the Interest
of the depos'd King should fall in with
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
this Party, and those that were Friends
to the general Good, never forgave it
them.</P>
<P><HI>All that could be said to excuse them,</HI>
was the Plot I am speaking of, that by
carrying this Point for that Party, they
hookt in those forward People to join
in a popular Cry of Liberty and Pro∣perty,
<HI>things they were never fond of be∣fore,</HI>
and to make some Settlement of the
Peoples Claims <HI>which they always had op∣pos'd,</HI>
and which they would <HI>since have
been very glad to have repeal'd.</HI></P>
<P>So great an Ascendant had the <HI>Per∣sonal
spleen</HI> of this Party over their o∣ther
Principles, that they were content
to <HI>let the Liberties of the People be declar'd</HI>
in their highest Claims, rather than not
obtain this one Article, which they
knew would <HI>so exceedingly mortify their
Prince,</HI> and strengthen the Nations E∣nemies.
They freely join'd in <HI>Acts of
Succession, Abjuration, Declaration</HI> of the
Power and <HI>Claims of the People,</HI> and the
Superiority of their Right to the Princes
Prerogative, and abundance of such
things, <HI>which they could never be otherwise
brought to.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="206"/>
<HI>'Tis true these were great things,</HI> but
'twas thought all this might have been
obtain'd <HI>in Conjunction with their Prince,</HI>
rather than by putting Affronts and
Mortifications upon the Man that had
next to the Influence of Heaven, been
the only Agent of restoring them to a
Power and Capacity of enjoying, as well
as procuring, such things as National
Priviledges.</P>
<P>'Twas vigorosly alledg'd that <HI>Stand∣ing
Armies in times of Peace, were incon∣sistent
with the Publick Safety,</HI> the Laws
and Constitutions of all the Nations <HI>in
the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>But these Allegations were strenuously
answer'd, that it was true without the
consent of the great National Council, it
was so, but <HI>that being obtain'd,</HI> it was not
illegal, and publick Necessities might
make that consent, not only legal, but
convenient.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas all to no purpose,</HI> the whole was
carry'd with a Torrent of Clamour and
Reflection against the good Prince, <HI>who
consented,</HI> because he would in nothing
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
oppose the Current of the People; but
withal, told them plainly what would
be the consequences of their Heat, <HI>which
they have effectually found true since</HI> to their
Cost, and to the loss of some Millions of
Treasure.</P>
<P>For no sooner was this Army broke,
<HI>which was the best ever that Nation saw,</HI> and
was justly the Terror of the Enemy,
but the great Monarch we mention'd
before, broke all Measures with this
Prince and the Confederate Nations,
a Proof what just apprehensions they
had of his Conduct, at the head of such
an Army. For <HI>they broke with contempt,</HI>
a Treaty which the Prince <HI>upon a pros∣pect
of this unkindness of his People</HI> had
entred into with the Enemy, and which
he engag'd in, if possible, to prevent <HI>a
new War,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e foresaw he should be
very unfit to begin, or carry on, and
which they would never have dar'd to
break had not <HI>this Feud</HI> happen'd.</P>
<P>It was but a little before I came into
this Country, when <HI>such repeated Ac∣counts
came,</HI> of the Incroachments, In∣sults
and Preparations of their <HI>great pow∣erful
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
Neighbour,</HI> that all the World saw
the necessity of a War, and the very
People <HI>who were to feel it most</HI> apply'd to
the Prince to begin it.</P>
<P>He was forward enough to begin it, and
in compliance with his People, re re∣solv'd
on it; but <HI>the Grief</HI> of the usage
he had receiv'd, the unkind Treatment
he had met with from those very People
that brought him thither, had <HI>sunk so</HI>
deep upon his Spirits, that he could ne∣ver
recover it; but being very weak in
Body and Mind, and join'd to a slight hurt
he receiv'd by a fall from his Horse, <HI>he
dyed,</HI> to the unspeakable grief of all his
Subjects that wish'd well to their Na∣tive
Country.</P>
<P>This was the melancholly Account
of this great Prince's end, and I have been
told that at once every Year, there is a
kind <HI>of Fast,</HI> or solemn 'Commemora∣tion
kept up for the Murther of that for∣mer
Prince, who, as I noted, <HI>was Be∣headed
by his Subjects;</HI> So it seems some
of the People, who are of Opinion this
Prince was Murther'd by the ill Treat∣ment
of his Friends, a way which I must
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
own, <HI>is the cruellest of Deaths,</HI> keep the
same Day, to commemorate his Death,
and this is a Day, in which it seems <HI>both
Parties are very free with one another, as to
Rallery and ill Language.</HI></P>
<P>But the Friends of this last Prince
have a double advantage, for they also
commemorate the Birth Day of this
Prince, and are generally very merry
on that Day; and the custom is at their
Feast on that Day, just like our drinking
Healths; they pledge one another <HI>to the
immortal Memory of their Deliverer;</HI> as
the Historical part of this Matter was
absolutely necessary to introduce the fol∣Remarks,
and to instruct the Ignorant in
those things, I hope it <HI>shall not be thought
a barren Digression,</HI> especially when I
shall tell you that it is a most exact Re∣presentation
of what is yet to come in
a Scene of Affairs, of which I must
make a short Abstract, by way of Intro∣duction.</P>
<P>The deceas'd Prince we have heard of,
was succeeded by his Sister in-Law, the
second Daughter of the banish'd Prince,
a Lady of <HI>an extraordinary Character,</HI> of
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
the Old Race of their Kings, <HI>a Native</HI> by
Birth, <HI>a Solunarian</HI> by Profession ex∣ceeding
<HI>Pious, Just</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> of an <HI>Ho∣nesty</HI>
peculiar to her self, and for which
she was justly belov'd of all sorts and
degrees of her Subjects.</P>
<P>This Princess having the Experience
of her <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Grand-father</HI> before her,
join'd to her own Prudence and Hone∣sty
of Design; it was no wonder if she
prudently shun'd all manner of <HI>rash
Counsels,</HI> and endeavour'd to carry it
with a steady Hand between her con∣tending
Parties.</P>
<P>At her first coming to the Crown,
she made <HI>a solemn Declaration</HI> of her re∣solutions
for <HI>Peace</HI> and just Government;
she gave the <HI>Crolians</HI> her Royal Word,
that she would inviolably preserve the
<HI>Toleration of their Religion and Worship,</HI>
and always afford them <HI>her Protection,</HI>
and by this she hop'd they would <HI>be
easy.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>to the Solunarians,</HI> as those among
whom she had been Educated, and
whose Religion she had always pro∣fess'd,
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
been train'd up in, and Piously
persued; she express'd her self <HI>with an
uncommon Tenderness,</HI> told them they
should be the Men of her Favour, and
those that were <HI>most zealous</HI> for that
Church should have most of her Coun∣tenance;
and she back'd this soon after
with an unparallel'd Act of Royal Bounty
to them, freely, parting with a considera∣ble
Branch <HI>of her Royal Revenue,</HI> for the
<HI>poor Priests of</HI> that Religion, of which
there were many in the remote Parts of
her Kingdom.</P>
<P>What vast Consequences, and prodi∣giously
differing from the Design, may
Words have when mistaken and mis∣ayplyed
by the Hearers. Never were
significant Expressions spoken from a sin∣cere,
honest and generous Principle, with
a single Design to ingage all the Subjects
in <HI>the Moon,</HI> to Peace and Union, so
perverted, misapply'd and turn'd by a
Party, to a meaning directly contrary
to the Royal Thoughts of the Queen:
For from this very Expression, <HI>most Zea∣lous,</HI>
grew all the Divisions and Subdi∣visions
in the <HI>Solunarian Church,</HI> to the
Ruin of their own Cause, and the vast
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
advantage of the <HI>Crolian</HI> Interest. The
eager Men of the Church, especially
those we have been talking of, <HI>hastily
cathc'd</HI> at this Expression of the Queen,
<HI>Most Zealous,</HI> and Millions of fatal Con∣structions,
and unhappy Consequences
they made of it, some of which are as
follows.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>They took it to imply</HI> that the Queen
whatever she had said to <HI>the Crolians,</HI>
really desing'd <HI>their Destruction,</HI> and that
those that were of that Opinion, must
be meant by the <HI>Most Zealous</HI> Members
of the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Church, and they
could understand <HI>Zeal</HI> no otherwise than
their <HI>own way.</HI></P>
<P>2. From this Speech, and their mi∣staking
the Words <HI>Most Zealous,</HI> arose
an unhappy Distinction among the <HI>So∣lunarians</HI>
themselves, some <HI>Zealous,</HI> some
<HI>More Zealous,</HI> winch afterwards divided
them into two most opposite Parties,
being fomented by an accident of a Book
publish'd <HI>on an Qccasion,</HI> of which pre∣sently.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="207" REF="213"/>
The Consequences of this mistake,
appear'd presently in the <HI>Most Zealous,</HI>
in their offering all possible Insults to
the <HI>Crolian Dissenters,</HI> Preaching them
down, <HI>Printing</HI> them down, and <HI>Talk∣ing</HI>
them down, as a People not fit to
be suffer'd <HI>in the Nation,</HI> and now they
thought they had the Game sure.</P>
<P>Down with the <HI>Crolians</HI> began to be
all the Cry, and truly the <HI>Crolians them∣selves</HI>
began to be uneasy, and had no∣thing
to rely upon <HI>but the Queens Pro∣mise,</HI>
which however her Majesty al∣ways
made good to them.</P>
<P>The other Party proceeded so far, that
they begun, to Insult <HI>the very Queen her
self,</HI> upon the Matter of her Word, and
one of her College-Priests told her plain∣ly
in Print, she could not be a true
Friend to <HI>the Solunarian Church,</HI> if she
did not declare War against, and root
out all the <HI>Crolians</HI> in her Dominions.</P>
<P>But these Proceedings met <HI>with a
Cheek,</HI> by a very odd accident: A cer∣tain
<HI>Author</HI> of those Countries, a <HI>very
mean, obscure and despicable Fellow,</HI> of no
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
great share of Wit, but that had a very
<HI>unlucky way of telling his Story,</HI> seeing
which way things were a going, writes
a Book, and <HI>Personating this high Solu∣narian
Zeal,</HI> musters up all their Argu∣ments,
<HI>as if</HI> they were his own, and
strenuously pretends to prove that <HI>all the
Crolians</HI> ought to be Destroy'd, <HI>Hang'd,
Banish'd,</HI> and the D—1 and all. As
this Book was a perfect Surprize to all
the Country, so the Proceedings about
it on all sides were as extraordinary.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians</HI> themselves were sur∣priz'd
at it, and so closely had the Au∣thor
couch'd his Design, that they ne∣ver
saw <HI>the Irony of the Stile,</HI> but began
to look about them, to see which way
they should fly to save themselves.</P>
<P><HI>The Men of Zeal</HI> we talk'd of, were so
blinded with the Notion which <HI>suited so
exactly with their real Design,</HI> that they
hugg'd the Book, <HI>applauded the unknown
Author,</HI> and plac'd the Book next their
<HI>Oraclar Writings,</HI> or Laws of Religion.</P>
<P>The Author was all this while con∣ceal'd,
and the Paper had all the effect
he wish'd for.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215"/>
For as it caus'd <HI>these first</HI> Gentlemen
to daress, applaud and approve it, and
thereby discover'd their real Intention,
so it met with Abhorrence and Detesta∣tion
in all the Men of <HI>Principles, Pru∣dence</HI>
and <HI>Moderation</HI> in the Kingdom,
who tho' they were <HI>Solunarians</HI> in Reli∣gion,
yet were not for Blood, Desola∣tion
and Persecution of their Brethren,
but <HI>with the Queen</HI> were willing they
should enjoy their Liberties and Estates;
they behaving themselves <HI>quietly and
peaceably</HI> to the Government.</P>
<P>At last it came out that it was writ
by <HI>a Crolian;</HI> but <HI>good God!</HI> what a Cla∣mour
was rais'd at the poor Man, the
<HI>Crolians</HI> flew at him like Lightning, <HI>igno∣rantly
and blindly,</HI> not seeing that he had
sacrific'd himself and his Fortunes in
their behalf; they <HI>rumag'd his Character</HI>
for Reproaches, tho' they could find lit∣tle
that way to hurt him; they plenti∣fully
loaded him with ill Language and
Railing, and took a great deal of pains
to let the World see their <HI>own Ignorance
and Ingratitude.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ministers of State,</HI> tho' at that time
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
<HI>of the fiery Party,</HI> yet seeing the general
Detestation of such a Proposal, and how
ill it <HI>would go down with the Nation,</HI> tho'
they approv'd the thing, yet began to
scent the Design, and were also oblig'd
to declare against it, for fear of being
thought of the same Mind.</P>
<P>Thus the Author was Proscrib'd by
Proclamation, and a <HI>Reward</HI> of 50000
<HI>Hecato's,</HI> a small imaginary Coin in those
Parts, put upon his Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cortez,</HI> of the Nation being at the
same time assembled join'd in Censuring
the Book, and thus <HI>the Party</HI> blindly
damn'd <HI>their own Principles</HI> for meer
shame of the practice, not daring to
own the thing in publick which they
had underhand profest, and the fury of
all Parties fell <HI>upon the poor Author.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Man fled the first popular Fury,</HI> but
at last being betraid fell into the Hands
of the publick Ministry.</P>
<P>When they <HI>had him</HI> they hardly Knew
<HI>what to do with him;</HI> they could not pro∣ceed
against him as Author of a Proposal
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
for the Destruction of <HI>the Crolians,</HI> be∣cause
it appear'd he was <HI>a Crolian him∣self;</HI>
they were loth to charge him with
suggesting that the <HI>Solunarian Church∣men</HI>
were guilty of such a Design, least
he should bring <HI>their own Writings to
prove it true;</HI> so they fell to <HI>whea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling
him</HI> with good words to throw himself
into their Hands and submit, giving him
that <HI>Geu-gau</HI> the <HI>Publick Faith</HI> for a Civil
and Gentleman-like <HI>Treatment;</HI> the Man,
believing <HI>like a Coxcomb</HI> that they spoke
as they meant, <HI>quitted his own Defence,</HI>
and threw himself on the Mercy <HI>of the
Queen as he thought;</HI> but they abusing
their Queen with false Representations,
<HI>Perjur'd all their Promises</HI> with him, and
treated him in a most barbarous manner,
on pretence that there were <HI>no such Pro∣mises
made,</HI> tho' he prov'd it upon them
by the Oath of the Persons to whom
they were made.</P>
<P>Thus they laid him under <HI>a heavy Sen∣tence,</HI>
Fin'd him more than they thought
him able to pay, and order'd him to be
expos'd to the Mob in the Streets.</P>
<P>Having him at this Advantage they
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
set upon him with their Emissaries to
discover to them his Adherents, <HI>as they
call'd them,</HI> and promis'd him great
Things on one Hand, threatning him
<HI>with his after Ruin</HI> on the other; and
the <HI>Great Scribe</HI> of the Country, with
another of their great Courtiers, took
such a low Step as to go to him <HI>to the
Dungeon</HI> where they had put him, to see
if they could tempt him <HI>to betray his
Friends.</HI> The <HI>Comical Dialogue</HI> between
them there the Author of this
has seen <HI>in Manuscript,</HI> exceeding <HI>di∣verting,</HI>
but having not time to Tran∣slate
it 'tis omitted for the present; tho'
promises to <HI>publish it in its proper Sea∣son</HI>
for publick Instruction.</P>
<P>However for the present it may suf∣fice
to tell the World, that neither by
<HI>Promises of Reward, or fear, of Punishment</HI>
they could prevail upon him to discover
any thing, and so it remains a Secret to
this day.</P>
<P>The Title of this, unhappy Book was
<HI>The shortest way with the Crolians.</HI> The
Effects of it were various, as will be
seen in our ensuing Discourse: As to the
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
Author nothing was more unaccounta∣ble
than the Circumstances of his Treat∣ment;
for he met with all <HI>that Fate</HI> which
they must expect <HI>who attempt to open the
Eyes of a Nation wilfully blind.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>hot Men of the Solunarian Church</HI>
damn'd him without <HI>Bell, Book,</HI> or <HI>Can∣dle;</HI>
the more <HI>Moderate</HI> pitied him, but
lookt on as unconcern'd: <HI>But the Croli∣ans,</HI>
for whom he had run this Venture,
us'd him worst of all; for they not only
abandon'd him, but <HI>reproacht him as an
Enemy</HI> that would ha' them destroy'd:
So one side rail'd at him because they
<HI>did understand</HI> him, and the other because
<HI>they did not.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Man sunk under the general
Neglect, was ruin'd and undone, and
left a Monument of what every Man
must; expect that serves a good Cause,
<HI>profest</HI> by an <HI>unthankful People.</HI></P>
<P>And here it was I found out that my
Lunar Philosopher was <HI>only so</HI> in Dis∣guise,
and that <HI>he was no Philosopher, but
the very Man</HI> I have been talking of.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="220"/>
<HI>From this Book,</HI> and the Treatment its
Author receiv'd, for they us'd him with
all possible Rigour, a new Scene of Par∣ties
came upon the Stage, and this
Queen's Reign began to be fill'd with
more Divisions and Feuds than any be∣fore
her.</P>
<P><HI>These Parties</HI> began to be so numerous
and violent that <HI>it endanger'd the Publick
Good,</HI> and gave great Disadvantages to
the general Affairs abroad.</P>
<P>The Queen invited them all to <HI>Peace
and Union,</HI> but 'twas in vain; nay, one
had the Impudence to publish that to
procure Peace and Ʋnion it was neces∣sary
to suppress <HI>all the Crolians,</HI> and have
no Party but one, and then all must be
of a Mind.</P>
<P>From this heat of Parties all the mo∣derate
Men fell in with their Queen,
and were heartily <HI>for Peace and Ʋnion:</HI>
The other, who were now distinguish'd
by the Title of <HI>High Solunarians,</HI> call'd
these all <HI>Crolians</HI> and <HI>Low Solunarians,</HI>
and began to Treat them with more
Inveteracy than they us'd to do the <HI>Cro∣lians,
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
lians</HI> themselves, calling them <HI>Traytors</HI> to
their Country, <HI>Betrayers</HI> of their Mother,
<HI>Serpents</HI> harbour'd in the Bosom, who bite,
sting and hiss at the Hand that succour'd
them; and in short the Enmity grew
so violent, that from hence proceeded
one of the <HI>subtilest, foolishest, deep, shal∣low</HI>
Contrivances and <HI>Plots</HI> that ever
was hatcht or set on foot by any Party
of Men in the whole Moon, at least who
pretended <HI>to any Brains,</HI> or to half a
degree <HI>of common</HI> Understanding.</P>
<P>There had always been Dislikes and
Distasts between even the most mode∣rate
<HI>Solunarians</HI> and the <HI>Crolians,</HI> as I
have noted in the beginning of this
Relation, and these were deriv'd
from <HI>Dissenting in Opinions of Religion,</HI>
ancient Feuds, private Interest, Educa∣tion,
and the like; and the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
had frequently, on pretence of securing
the Government, made Laws to ex∣clued
the <HI>Crolians</HI> from any part of the
Administration, unless they submitted
to some <HI>Religious Tests</HI> and Ceremonies
which were prescrib'd them.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>the keeping them out of Offices</HI>
was more the Design than the <HI>Conver∣sion
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
of the Crolians</HI> to the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Church, the <HI>Crolians,</HI> at least many of
them, <HI>submitted to the Test,</HI> and frequent∣ly
Conform'd to qualify themselves for
publick Employments.</P>
<P><HI>The most moderate of the Solunarians</HI>
were in their Opinion against this pra∣ctice,
and the <HI>High Men</HI> taking advan∣tage
of them, <HI>drew them in</HI> to Concur in
making a Law with yet more Severity
against them, effectually to keep them
out of Employment.</P>
<P><HI>The low Solunarians</HI> were easy to be
drawn into this Project, as it was only
a Confirming former Laws of their own
making, and all Things run fair <HI>for the
Design;</HI> but as the <HI>High Men</HI> had further
Ends in it than barely reducing the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
to Conformity, they coucht so ma∣ny
gross Clauses into their Law, that
even the <HI>Grandees of the Solunarians</HI>
themselves could not comply with; nay
even the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> of the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Church declar'd against it, as tending
to Persecution and Confusion.</P>
<P>This Disappointment <HI>enrag'd the Party,</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
and that very Rage entirely ruin'd their
Project; for now the <HI>Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Pa∣triarchs,</HI>
and all the wise Men of the Na∣tion,
joining together against these <HI>Men
of Meat and Furry,</HI> the Queen began to
see into their Designs, and <HI>as she was of a
most pious and peaceable Temper,</HI> she con∣ceiv'd
a just Hatred of so wicked and
barbarous a Design, and immediately
dismiss'd from her Council and Favour
<HI>the Great Scribe,</HI> and several others who
were Leaders in the Design, <HI>to the great
mortification of the whole Party,</HI> and utter
Ruin of the intended Law against <HI>the
Crolians.</HI></P>
<P>Here I could not but observe, as I
have done before in the Case of the ba∣nish'd
King, how <HI>impolitick these high
Solunarian Church-men acted</HI> in all their
Proceedings, for had they contented
themselves <HI>by little and little</HI> to ha' done
their Work, they had done it effectually;
but pushing at Extremities they over∣shot
themselves, and <HI>ruin'd all.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>the Grandees</HI> and <HI>Patriarchs</HI> made
but a <HI>few trifling Objections</HI> at first, nay and
came off, and yielded some of them too;
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
and if these would ha' consented to ha'
parted with some Clauses which they
have willingly left out since, they had
had it pass'd; but these were <HI>as hot Men
always are,</HI> too eager and sure of their
Game, they thought all was their own,
and so they lost themselves.</P>
<P>If they rail'd at the <HI>low Solunarian
Church-men</HI> before, they doubled their
Clamors at them now, all the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI>
and all the Nobility and <HI>Grandees,</HI> nay
even the <HI>Queen</HI> her self came under their
Censure, and every Body who was not of
their Mind were <HI>Prestarians</HI> and <HI>Crolians.</HI></P>
<P>As this Rage of theirs was implacable,
so, as I hinted before, it drove them into
another <HI>Subdivision of Parties,</HI> and now be∣gan
<HI>the Mysterious Plot</HI> to be laid which I
mention'd beforre; for the <HI>Cortez</HI> being
summon'd, and the Law being proposed,
some of these <HI>high Solunarians</HI> appear'd in
Confederacy with the <HI>Crolians, in perfect
Confederacy</HI> with them, a thing no Body
would have imagin'd could ever ha' been
brought to pass.</P>
<P>Now as these sorts of Plots must al∣ways
be carry'd very nicely, so these
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
<HI>high Gentlemen</HI> who Confederated with
the <HI>Crolians,</HI> having, to spight the other,
resolv'd effectually to prevent the
passing the Law against <HI>the Qualification
of the Crolians,</HI> it was not their Business
immediately to declare themselves <HI>against</HI>
it as a Law, but by still loading it with
some Extravagance or other, and push∣ing
it on to some intolerable Extreme,
<HI>secure its miscarriage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the managing this Plot,</HI> one of their
<HI>Authors</HI> was specially employ'd, and <HI>that
all that was really true of the</HI> Crolian Dis∣senters
might be ridicul'd, his Work was
to draw <HI>monstrous Pictures</HI> of them,
which no Body could believe; this
took immediately, for now People
began to look at their Shooes to see
if they were not <HI>Cloven Footed</HI> as
they went a long Streets; and at last
finding they were really shap'd like the
rest <HI>of the Lunar Inhabitants,</HI> they went
back <HI>to the Author,</HI> who was a Learned
Member of a certain Seminary, or Bro∣ther-hood
of <HI>the Solunarian Clergy,</HI> and
enquir'd if he were <HI>not Mad,</HI> Distract∣ed
and <HI>Raving,</HI> or <HI>Moon-blind,</HI> and in
want of the thinking Engine; but find∣ing
all things <HI>right there,</HI> and that he
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
was in his Senses, especially in a Morn∣ing
when he was a little <HI>free from,</HI> &amp;c.
that he was a Good, Honest, Jolly,
<HI>Solunarian Priest,</HI> and no room could be
found for an Objection there. Upon all
these Searches it presently appear'd, and
all Men concluded it was a meer <HI>Fana∣tick
Crolian Plot;</HI> that this <HI>High Party
of all</HI> were but Pretenders, and meer
Traytors'to the <HI>True High Solunarian
Church-Men,</HI> that wearing the same
Cloth had herded among them <HI>in Dis∣guise,</HI>
only to wheedle them into such
wild Extravagancies as must of necessi∣ty
confuse their Councils, expose their
Persons, and ruin their Cause.—Ac∣cording
to the like Practice, put upon
their <HI>Abrograzian</HI> Prince, and of which
I have spoken before.</P>
<P>And since I am upon the detection of
this <HI>most refin'd Practice,</HI> I crave leave
to descend to some particular Instances,
which will the better evince the Truth
of this Matter, and make it appear
that either this was really <HI>a Crolian Plot,</HI>
or else all these People were <HI>perfectly
Distracted;</HI> and as their Wits in <HI>that Lu∣nar
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
World</HI> are much higher strain'd <HI>than
ours,</HI> so their Lunacy, where it hap∣pens,
must according to the Rules <HI>of Ma∣thematical
Nature,</HI> bear an extream E∣qual
in proportion.</P>
<P><HI>This College Fury of a Man</HI> was the first
on whom this useful Discovery was made,
and having <HI>writ several Learned Tracts</HI>
wherein he invited the People <HI>to Mur∣ther</HI>
and Destroy <HI>all the Crolians,</HI> Brand∣ed
all the <HI>Solunarian Patriarchs, Clergy</HI>
and <HI>Gentry</HI> that would not come into
<HI>his Proposal,</HI> with the name of <HI>Cowards,
Traytors</HI> and <HI>Betrayers</HI> of <HI>Lunar Religion;</HI>
having beat the <HI>Concionazimir</HI> at a great
Assembly of the Cadirs, <HI>or Judges,</HI> and
told them <HI>all the Crolians</HI> were <HI>Devils,</HI>
and they were <HI>all Perjur'd</HI> that did not
use them as such: He carry'd on Mat∣ters
<HI>so dexteroussly,</HI> and with such surpriz∣ing
Success, that he fill'd even <HI>the Solu∣narians</HI>
themselves with Horror at his
Proposals.—And as I happen'd to be
in one of their publick Halls where all
such Writings <HI>as are new</HI> are laid a cer∣tain
time to be read by <HI>every Comer,</HI>
I saw a little <HI>knot of Men</HI> round a Ta∣ble,
where one was reading <HI>this Book.</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
There were two <HI>Solunarian High Priests</HI>
in their proper Vestments, one <HI>Privy
Councellor</HI> of the State, one other <HI>Noble
Man,</HI> and one who had <HI>in his Hat</HI> a To∣ken,
to signifie that he possest one of the
<HI>fine Feathers</HI> of the <HI>Consolidator,</HI> of
which I have given the Description al∣ready.</P>
<P><HI>The Book being read</HI> by one of the ha∣bited
Priests, he starts up with some
warmth, <HI>by the Moon, says he,</HI> I have
<HI>found this Fellow out,</HI> he is certainly a
<HI>Crolian,</HI> a meer <HI>Prestarian Crolian,</HI>
and is crept into our Church only <HI>in
Disguise,</HI> for 'tis certain all this is <HI>but
meer Banter</HI> and Irony to expose us, and
to ridicule the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Interest.</P>
<P><HI>The Privy Councellor</HI> took it presently,
whether he is <HI>a Crolian,</HI> or no, says he, I
cannot tell, but he has certainly <HI>done
the Crolians so much Service,</HI> that if they
had hir'd him to act for them, they
could not have desir'd he should serve
them better.</P>
<P>Truly, says <HI>the Man of the Feather,</HI> I
was always for pulling down the <HI>Crolians,</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
for I thought them dangerous to the
State; but this Man has brought the
Matter <HI>nearer to my View,</HI> and shown me
<HI>what destroying them is,</HI> for he put me up∣on
examining the Consequences, and
now I find it would be <HI>lopping off the
Limbs of the Government,</HI> and laying it at
the Mercy of the Enemy <HI>that they might
lop off its Head;</HI> I assure you he has done
<HI>the Crolians</HI> great Service, for whereas
abundance of our Men <HI>of the Feather</HI> were
for routing the <HI>Crolians,</HI> they lately fell
down to 134 or thereabouts.</P>
<P>All this confirm'd the first Man's Opi∣nion
that <HI>he was a Crolian in Disguise,</HI> or
an Emissary employ'd by them to rui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Project of their Enemies; for <HI>these
Crolians are damn'd cunning People in their
may,</HI> and they have Mony enough to en∣gage
Hirelings to their side.</P>
<P>Another Party concern'd in <HI>this Plot</HI>
was an old; <HI>cast-out Solunarian Priest,</HI>
who, tho' professing himself a <HI>Soluna∣rian,</HI>
was turn'd out for adhering to the

This Man draws <HI>the most monstrous Pi∣cture

<P><PB N="225" REF="231"/>
From this famous Author I could not
but proceed to observe the farther Pro∣gress
of this most refrn'd piece of Cun∣ning,
among, the <HI>very great Ones, Gran∣dees,
Feathers,</HI> and <HI>Consolidators</HI> of the
Country. For these <HI>Cunning Crolians</HI>
manag'd their Intriegues so nicely, that
they brought about a Famous Division
even among the <HI>High Solunarian Party
themselves;</HI> and whereas the Law of Qua∣lification
was reviv'd again, and in
great Danger of being completed; these
subtle <HI>Crolians</HI> brought over One Hun∣dred
and Thirty Four <HI>of the Feathers</HI> in
the Famous <HI>Consolidator</HI> to be of their
side, and to <HI>contrive the utter Destruction
of it; and thus fell the Design</HI> which the
<HI>High Solunarian</HI> Church Men had laid
for the Ruin of <HI>the Crolians Interest,</HI>
by their own Friends first joining in
all the Extremes they had proposed, and
then pushing it so much farther, and to
such <HI>mad Periods</HI> that the very highest
Of them <HI>stood amaz'd</HI> at the Design,
<HI>startled, flew back</HI> and made a <HI>full stop;</HI>
They were willing to Ruin the <HI>Crolians,</HI>
but they were not willing to Ruin the
whole Nation. The more these Men
began to consider, the more furiously
these Plotters carry'd on their Extrava∣gances;
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
at last they made <HI>a General push</HI>
at a thing in which they knew if the
other <HI>High Men</HI> joyn'd, they must throw
<HI>all into Confusion,</HI> bring a <HI>Foreign Enemy</HI>
on their Backs, <HI>unravel all the Thread of
the War,</HI> fight all their Victories <HI>back
again,</HI> and involve the whole Nation in
<HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Confusion.</HI></P>
<P>They knew well enough that most of
the <HI>High Men</HI> would hesitate at this,
they knew if they did not the <HI>Grandees</HI>
and <HI>Patriarchs</HI> would reject it, and so
they plaid the <HI>surest Game</HI> to blastl and
overthrow this Law, that could possibly
be plaid.</P>
<P>If any Man, <HI>in the whole World in the
Moon,</HI> will pretend this was not <HI>a Plot,</HI>
a <HI>Crolian Design,</HI> a meer <HI>Conspiracy to de∣stroy
the Law,</HI> let Him tell me for what
other end could these Men offer such ex∣treams
as they needs must know would
meet with immediate opposition, things
that they knew all the Honest Men, all
the <HI>Grandees,</HI> all the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>triarchs,</HI> and al∣most
all the <HI>Feathers</HI> would oppose.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="233"/>
From hence all the Men of any fore∣sight
brought it to this pass, as is before
Noted, that either these One Hundred
and Thirty Four were <HI>Fools</HI> or <HI>Mad-Men,</HI>
or that it was a <HI>Phanatick Crolian
Plot</HI> and Conspiracy to Ruin the make∣ing
this Law, which the rest of the <HI>So∣lunarian
Church Men</HI> were very forward
to carry on.</P>
<P>I heard indeed some Men Argue that
this could not be, the breach was too
wide between <HI>the Crolians</HI> and these
Gentlemen ever to come to such an A∣greement;
but <HI>the Wiser Heads</HI> who ar∣gu'd
the other way, always brought
them, as is noted above, to this pinch
of Argument; that either it must be so,
<HI>be a Fanatick Crolian Plot,</HI> or else the
<HI>Men of Fury</HI> were all <HI>Fools, Madmen,</HI> and
fitter for an <HI>Hospital,</HI> than a State-House,
or a <HI>Pulpit.</HI></P>
<P>It must be allow'd, these <HI>Crolians</HI>
were Cunning People, thus to wheedle
in these <HI>High Flying Solunarians</HI> to break
the Neck of their dear Project.</P>
<P>But upon the whole, for ought I cou'd
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
see, whether it went one way or t'other,
all the Nation esteem'd the other Peo∣ple
<HI>Fools</HI>—<HI>Fools</HI> of the most extraordi∣nary
<HI>Size in all the Moon, for either way</HI>
they pull'd down what they had been
many Years a Building.</P>
<P>I cannot say that this was in kindness
to the <HI>Crolians,</HI> but in meer Malice to
the <HI>Low Solunarian Party,</HI> who had the
Government in their Hands, for <HI>Ma∣lice
always carries Men on to monstrous Ex∣tremes.</HI></P>
<P>Some indeed have thought it hard to
call this a Plot, and a Confederacy <HI>with
the Crolians.</HI>—But I cannot but think
it the <HI>kindest thing that can be said of them,</HI>
and that 'tis impossible those People
who push'd at some imaginary Things
in <HI>that Law,</HI> could but be in a Plot as
aforesaid, or be perfectly <HI>Lunatick,</HI> down
right Mad-Men, or Traytors to their
Country, <HI>and let them choose which Cha∣racter
they like.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot in Charity but spare them
their <HI>Honesty,</HI> and their <HI>Senses,</HI> and at∣tribute
it all to their Policy.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="235"/>
When I had understood all things at
large, and found the exceeding depth
of the Design; I must confess the Dis∣covery
of these things <HI>was very divert∣ing,</HI>
and the more so, when I made the
proper Reflections upon the <HI>Analogy there
seem'd to be</HI> between these <HI>Solunarian
High Church-Men</HI> in the Moon, and ours
here in <HI>England; our High Church-Men</HI>
are no more to compare to <HI>these,</HI> than
the Hundred and Thirty Four, are to
the <HI>Consolidators.</HI></P>
<P>Ours can Plot now and then a little
among themselves, but then 'tis all <HI>Gross</HI>
and <HI>plain Sailing,</HI> down right <HI>ta∣king
Arms,</HI> calling in Foreign Forces,
<HI>Assassinations</HI> and <HI>the like;</HI> but these are
nothing to the more Exquisite Heads in
<HI>the Moon.</HI> For they have the subtil∣lest
Ways with them, that ever were
heard of. They can <HI>make War</HI> with a
Prince, on purpose to <HI>bring him to the
Crown;</HI> fit out <HI>vast Navies against him,</HI>
that he may have the more leisure <HI>to take
their Merchant Men;</HI> make <HI>Descents</HI> upon
him, on purpose to come Home and do
<HI>nothing;</HI> if they have a mind to a Sea
Fight, they carefully send out Admirals
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
that, care not to come within half a
Mile of the Enemy, that coming off safe
they may have <HI>the boasting Part</HI> of
the Victory, and <HI>the beaten Part both
together.</HI></P>
<P>'Twould be endless to call over the
Roll of their sublime Politicks. They
<HI>damn Moderation in order to Peace and Ʋ∣nion,</HI>
let the House <HI>on Fire</HI> to save it
from <HI>Desolation,</HI> Plunder to avoid Perse∣cution,
and <HI>consolidate Things</HI> in order
to their more <HI>immediate Dissolution.</HI></P>
<P>Had our <HI>High Church-Men</HI> been Ma∣sters
of these excellent Arts, they had
long ago brought their Designs to
pass.</P>
<P>The exquisite Plot of these <HI>High Solu∣narians</HI>
answer'd the <HI>Crolians End,</HI> for it
broke all their Enemies Measures, the Law
vanish'd, the Grandees could hardly be
perswaded to read it, and when it was
propos'd to be read again, <HI>they hist at it,</HI>
and threw it by with Contempt.</P>
<P>Nor was this all; for it not only lost
them their Design as to this Law, but it
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
absolutely broke the Party, and just as it
was with <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> as soon as <HI>they
Sinn'd</HI> they <HI>Quarrell'd,</HI> and fell out with
one another; so, as soon as things came
to this height; <HI>the Party fell</HI> out <HI>one a∣mong
another,</HI> and even <HI>High Men</HI> them∣selves
were divided, some were for <HI>Con∣solidating,</HI>
and some not for <HI>Consolidat∣ing,</HI>
some were' for <HI>Tacking,</HI> and some
not for <HI>Tacking,</HI> as they were, or were
not let into the Secret.</P>
<P>If this <HI>Confusion of Languages,</HI> or In∣terest
lost them the real Design, it can∣not
be a wonder; have we not always
seen it <HI>in our World,</HI> that dividing an
Interest, weakens and exposes it? Has
not a great many both good and bad De∣signs
been render'd Abortive in <HI>this our
Lower World,</HI> for want of <HI>the Harmony
of Parties,</HI> and the Unanimity of those
concern'd in the Design?</P>
<P>How had the <HI>knot of Rebellion</HI> been
dissolv'd in <HI>England</HI> if it had not been
untied by the very Hands <HI>of those that
knit it?</HI> All the contrary Force
had been entirely broken and subdu'd,
and the <HI>Restoration of Monarchy</HI> had ne∣ver
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> if <HI>Ʋnion and
Agreement</HI> had been found among the
managers of that Age.</P>
<P>The Enemies of the present Establish∣ment
have shown sufficiently that they
perfectly understand the <HI>shortest way</HI> to
our infallible Destruction, when they
bend their principle Force at dividing
us into Parties, and keeping those Par∣ties
at th utmost variance.</P>
<P><HI>But this is not all,</HI> the Author of this
cannot but observe here that as <HI>England</HI>
is unhappily divided among Parties, so
it has this one Felicity even to be found
in the very matter of her Misfortunes,
that those Parties are all again subdi∣vided
among themselves.</P>
<P>How easily might the Church have
crusht and subdu'd the Dissenters if they
had been all as mad as one Party, if they
Had not been <HI>some High</HI> and <HI>some Low</HI>
Church-men? And what Mischief
might not that one Party ha' done in
this Nation, had not they been divided
again into <HI>Jurant Jacobites</HI> and <HI>Non-Ju∣rant,</HI>
into <HI>Consolidators</HI> and <HI>Non-Consoli∣dators?</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
From whence 'tis plain to me,
that <HI>just as it is in the Moon</HI> these <HI>Consoli∣dating
Church-men</HI> are meer Confede∣rates
with the <HI>Whigs;</HI> and it must be so,
unless we should suppose them meer <HI>mad
Men</HI> that don't know what they are a
doing, and who are the Drudges of their
Enemies, and kno' nothing of the
Matter.</P>
<P>And from this <HI>Lunar Observation</HI> it
presently occur'd to my Understanding,
that <HI>my Masters the Dissenters</HI> may come
in for a share among the <HI>Moon-blind</HI>
Men of this Generation, since had they
done for their own Interest what the
<HI>Laws fairly admits to</HI> be done, had they
been <HI>united among themselves,</HI> had they
form'd themselves into a <HI>Politick Body</HI> to
have acted in a publick, united Capa∣city
<HI>by general Concert,</HI> and as Persons
that had but one Interest <HI>and, understood
it,</HI> they had never been so often Insult∣ed
by every rising Party, they had never
had so many <HI>Machines</HI> and <HI>Intrigues to
ruin and suppress them,</HI> they had never
been so often <HI>Tackt</HI> and <HI>Consolidated</HI> to
Oppression and Persecution, and yet ne∣ver
have rebell'd or broke the Peace, in∣curr'd
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
the Displeasure of their Princes,
or have been upbraided with Plots, In∣surrections
and <HI>Antimonarchical Princi∣ples;</HI>
when they had made Treaties and
Capitulations with the Church <HI>for Tem∣per</HI>
and <HI>Toleration,</HI> the Articles would
have been kept, and these would have
demanded Justice with an Authority
that would upon all Occasions <HI>be respe∣cted.</HI></P>
<P>Were they united in <HI>Civil Polity</HI> in
<HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Interest,</HI> would they <HI>Buy and
Sell</HI> with <HI>one another,</HI> abstract their <HI>Stocks,</HI>
erect <HI>Banks</HI> and <HI>Companies</HI> in Trade <HI>of
their own,</HI> lend their Cash to the Govern∣ment
<HI>in a Body,</HI> and as a <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>If I were to tell them what Advan∣tages
the <HI>Crolians</HI> in the <HI>Moon</HI> make of
this sort of management, how the Go∣vernment
finds it their Interest to treat
them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and use them like Subjects
of Consideration; how upon all Occasi∣ons
some of the <HI>Grandees</HI> and <HI>Nobility</HI>
appear as Protectors of the <HI>Crolians,</HI> and
treat with their Princes in their Names,
present their Petitions, and make De∣mands
from the Prince of such Loans
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
and <HI>Sums of Mony</HI> as the publick Occasi∣ons
require; and what abundance of
Advantages are reapt from such a Uni∣on,
both to their own Body as a Party,
and to the Government also they would
be convinc'd; wherefore, I cannot but
very earnestly desire of the Dissenters, and
Whigs <HI>in my own Country,</HI> that they would
take a Journy in my <HI>Consolidator</HI> up to the
Moon, they would certainly see there
what vast Advantages they lose for want
of a <HI>Spirit of Ʋnion,</HI> and a concert of Mea∣sures
among themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians in the Moon</HI> are Men of
<HI>large Sauls,</HI> and Generously, stand by one
another <HI>on all Occasions;</HI> it was never
known that they deserted any Body
that suffer'd for them, <HI>my Old Philoso∣pher
excepted,</HI> and that was a surprize
upon them.</P>
<P>The Reason of the Difference is plain,
our Dissenters here have not the Ad∣vantage
of <HI>a Cogitator,</HI> or <HI>thinking En∣gine,</HI>
as they have <HI>in the Moon.</HI>—We
have the <HI>Elevator</HI> here, and are lifted
up pretty much, but <HI>in the Moon</HI> they
always go into the <HI>Thinking Engine</HI> up∣on
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
on every, <HI>Emergency,</HI> and in this they
out-do us of this World on every Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>In general therefore I must note that
the wisest Men I found <HI>in the Moon,</HI>
when they understood the Notes I had
made as above, of the sub-divisions of
our Parties, told me that it was the
greatest Happiness that could ha' been
obtained to our Country, for that if our
Parties had not been thus divided, <HI>the
Nation had been undone.</HI> They own'd that
had not their <HI>Solunarian Party</HI> been di∣vided
among themselves, the <HI>Crolians</HI> had
been undone, and all the <HI>Moon</HI> had been
involv'd <HI>in Persecution,</HI> and been very
probably subjeted to the <HI>Gallunarian
Monarch.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>fatal Errors of Men</HI> have
their advantages, the seperate ends they
serve are not foreseen by their Authors,
and they <HI>do good</HI> against the very <HI>Design
of the People,</HI> and the nature of the Evil
it self.</P>
<P>And now that I may encourage <HI>our
People</HI> to that Peace and good Under∣stading
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
among themselves, which can
alone produce their Safety and Deliver∣ance;
I shall give a brief Account how
the <HI>Crolians in the Moon</HI> came to open
their Eyes to their own Interest,
how they camp to <HI>Unite,</HI> and how
the Fruits of <HI>that</HI> Ʋnion secur'd them
from ever being insulted again by the
<HI>Solunarian Party,</HI> who in time gave over
the vain and fruitless Attempt, and so
a universal <HI>Lunar Calm</HI> has spread the
whole <HI>Moon</HI> ever since.</P>
<P>If <HI>our People</HI> will not listen to their
own Advantages, nor <HI>do their own Busi∣ness,</HI>
let them take the consequences to
themselves, they cannot blame the <HI>Man
in the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>To endeavour to bring this to pass,
as these Memoirs have run thro' the ge∣neral
Histrory of the Feuds and unhappy
Breaches between the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Church
and the <HI>Crolian</HI> Dissenters <HI>in the World
of the Moon,</HI> it would seem an imperfect
and abrupt Relation, if I should not tell
you how, and by what Method, <HI>tho'
long hid from their Eyes,</HI> the <HI>Crolians</HI> came
to understand their own Interest, and
<HI>know their own Strength.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="244"/>
'Tis true, it seem'd a Wonder to me
when I consider'd the Excellence and
Variety of those <HI>perspective Glasses</HI> I have
mentioned, the clearness of the Air, and
<HI>consequently of the Head,</HI> in this Lunar
World. I say it was very strange the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
should ha' been <HI>Moon Blind</HI> so long
as they were, that they could not see it
was always in their Power if they had
but pursued their own Interest, and
made use of those, legal Opportunities
which lay before them, to put them∣selves
in a Posture, as that the Govern∣ment
it self should think them a Body
too big to be insulted, and find it their
Interest to keep Measures with them.</P>
<P>It was indeed a long time before they
open'ed their Eyes to these advantages,
but bore the Insults of the hair-brain'd
Party, with a weakness and negligence
that was as unjustifiable in them, as un∣accountable
to all the Nations of the
<HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>But at last, as all violent Extremes
rouze <HI>their contrary Extremeties,</HI> the folly
and extravagance of the <HI>High Soluna∣rians</HI>
drove the <HI>Crolians</HI> into their Sen∣ses
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
and <HI>rouz'd them</HI> to their own Inte∣rest,
the occasion was among a great
many others as follows.</P>
<P>The eager <HI>Solunarian</HI> could not on all
occasions forbear to show their deep Re∣gret
at the Dissenting <HI>Crolians</HI> enjoying
the Tolleration of their Religion, <HI>by a
Law</HI>—.</P>
<P>And when all their legal Attempts to
lessen that Liberty had prov'd Abor∣tive,
her <HI>Solunarian Majesty</HI> on all
Occasions repeating her assurances of
the continuance of her Protection, and
particularly the maintaining this Tolle∣ration
Inviolable. They proceeded then
to show the remains of their mallice, in
<HI>little Insults,</HI> mean and <HI>illegal Methods,</HI>
and continual private Disturbances up∣on
particular persons, in which, how∣ever
the <HI>Crolians</HI> having recourse to the
Law, always found Justice on their side,
and had redress with Advantage, of
which the following Instance is more
than ordinarily Remarkable.</P>
<P>There had been a Law made by <HI>the
Men of the Feather,</HI> that all the meaner
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
idle sort of People, who had no settel'd
way of living should go to the War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and the <HI>Lazognians,</HI> a sort of Magistrate,
there, in the nature of our Justices of
the Peace, were to send them away by
Force.</P>
<P>Now it happen'd in a certain <HI>Soluna∣rian
Island,</HI> that for want of a better,
one of their High priests was put into
the Civil Administration, and made a
<HI>Lazogman.</HI>—In the Neighbourhood of
this Man's Jurisdiction, one of their own
<HI>Solunarian Priests</HI> had turn'd <HI>Crolian,</HI>
and whether he had a better Tallent at
performance, or rather was more dili∣gent
in his Office is not material, but he
set up a kind of a <HI>Crolian</HI> Temple in an
old Barn, or some such Mechanick Build∣ing,
and all the People stock'd after
him.</P>
<P>This so provok'd his Neighbours <HI>of
the black Girdle,</HI> an Order of Priests of
which he had been one, that they re∣solv'd
to supperss him let it cost what it
would.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="247"/>
They run <HI>strange lengths</HI> to bring this

that even <HI>the Crolians</HI> themselves
<HI>to their Shame,</HI> believ'd it, and took up
Prejudices against the Poor Man, which
had like to ha' been his Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>They proscrib'd him in Print</HI> for Crimes
they could never prove, <HI>they branded
him</HI> with Forgery, Adultery, Drunken∣ness,
Swearing, breaking Jayl, and a∣bundance
of Crimes; but when Mat∣ters
were examin'd and things came to
the Test, they could <HI>never prove the least
thing upon him.</HI>—In this manner how∣ever
they continually worryed the poor
Man, till they ruin'd his Family and <HI>re∣duc'd
him to Beggary;</HI> and tho' he came
out of the Prison they cast him into by
the meer force of Innocence, yet they
never left persuing him with all sorts of
violence.—At last they made use of
their <HI>Brother of the Girdle,</HI> who was in

Power to act the Tragedy <HI>they had pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tted</HI>
Against the poor Man.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> they seiz'd him without a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
Crime alledg'd, took violently from him
<HI>his Licence, as a Crolian Preist,</HI> by which
the Law justify'd what he had done,
pretending it was forg'd, and after very
ill Treating him, <HI>condemn'd him to the
Wars,</HI> delivers him up for a Souldier,
and accordingly carry'd him away.</P>
<P>But it happen'd, to their great Mor∣tification,
that this Man found more
Mercy from the <HI>Men of the Sword,</HI> than
from those <HI>of the Word,</HI> and so found
means to get out of their Hands, and
afterwards to undeceive all the Moon,
both as to his own Character, and as
to what he had Suffer'd.</P>
<P>For some of the <HI>Crolians,</HI> who began
to be made sensible of the Injury done
the poor Man, advis'd him to have
recourse to the Law, and to bring his
Adversaries before <HI>the Criminal Bar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="249"/>
But as soon as this was done, <HI>good
God!</HI> what a <HI>Scene of Villany</HI> was here
opened: The poor Man brought up
such a Cloud of Witnesses to confront
every Article of their Charge, and to
vindicate his own Character, that when
the very Judges heard it, tho' they were
all <HI>Solunarians</HI> themselves, they held up
their Hands, and declar'd in open
Court it was the <HI>deepest Track of Villany</HI>
that ever came before them, and that the
Actors ought to be made Examples no <HI>all
the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>The Persons concern'd, us'd all possi∣ble
Arts to avoid, or at least to delay the
Shame, and adjourn the Punishment,
thinking still to weary the poor Man
out.—But now his Brethren the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
began to fee themselves wounded
thro' his Sides, and above all, finding
his Innocence clear'd up beyond all man∣ner
of dispute, <HI>they espous'd his Cause,</HI>
and assisted him to prosecute his Ene∣mies,
which he did, till he brought
them all to Justice, expos'd them to the
last Degree, obtain'd full reparation of
all his Losses, and a publick Decree of
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
the Judges of his Justification <HI>and fu∣ture
Repose.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed when I saw the Proceedings
against this poor Man run to a heighth
so extravagant and monstrous, when I
found <HI>Malice, Forgery, Subornation, Perjury,</HI>
and a thousand unjustifiable Things
which their own Sense, if they had any,
might ha' been their Protection against,
and which any Child <HI>in the Moon</HI> might
ha' told them must one time or other
<HI>come upon the State</HI> and expose them; I
began to think these People were all in
<HI>the Crolian Plot</HI> too.</P>
<P>For really such Proceedings as these
were the greatest pieces of Service to
<HI>the Crolians</HI> as could possibly be done;
for as it generally proves in other
Places as well as in the Moon, that
<HI>Mischief unjustly contriv'd</HI> falls upon the
Head of the Authors, and redounds to
their treble Dishonour, so it was here;
the barbarity and inhumane Treatment
of this Man, made the sober and honest
Part even of the <HI>Solunarians</HI> them∣selves
blush for their Brethren, and own
that the Punishment awarded on them
was just.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="251"/>
Thus <HI>the Crolians</HI> got ground by the
Folly and Madness of their Enemies,
and the very Engines and Plots laid to
injure them, serv'd to bring their Ene∣mies
on the Stage, and expose both
them and their Cause.</P>
<P><HI>But this was not all,</HI> by these inces∣sant
Attacks on them as a Party, they
began <HI>to come to their Senses</HI> out of a 50
Year slumber, they found the Law on
their side, and the Government Moderate
and Just; they found they might <HI>oppose
Violence with Law,</HI> and that when
they did fly to the Refuge of Justice, they
always had the better of their Enemy;
flusht with this Success, it put them
upon considering <HI>what Fools they had been</HI>
all along to bear the Insolence of a few
hot-headed Men, who contrary to the
true Intent and Meaning of the Queen,
or of the Government, <HI>had resolv'd their
Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>It put them upon revolving the State
of their own Case, <HI>and comparing it
with their Enemies;</HI> upon Examining on
what foot they stood, and tho' Esta∣blish'd
upon a firm Law, yet a violent
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
Party <HI>pushing at the overthrow of that
Establishment,</HI> and dissolving the legal
Right they had to their Liberty and Re∣ligion;
it put them upon duly weigh∣ing
the nearness of their approaching
Ruin and Destruction, any finding
things run so hard against them, reflect∣ing
upon the Extremity of their Affairs,
and how if they had not drawn in the
High Church-Champions to <HI>damn the
Projects</HI> of their own Party, by running
at such desperate Extremes as all Men of
and Temper must of course abhor, they
had been undone; <HI>truly now they began
to consider,</HI> and to consult with one ano∣ther
<HI>what was to be done.</HI></P>
<P>Abundance of Projects were laid be∣fore
them, some too Dangerous, some
too Foolish to be put in practice; at
last they resolv'd to consult <HI>with my Phi∣losopher.</HI></P>
<P>He had been but scurvily treated by
them in his Troubles, and so Uni∣versally
abandon'd by the <HI>Crolians,</HI> that
even the <HI>Solunarians</HI> themselves insulted
them on that Head, and laugh'd
at them for expecting any Body should
<PB N="147" REF="253"/>
venture for them again.—But he for∣getting
their unkindness, ask'd them
what it was they desir'd of him?</P>
<P>They told him, they had heard that
he had reported he could put the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
in a way to secure themselves from
any possibility of being insulted again
<HI>by the Solunarians,</HI> and yet not disturb
the publick Tranquility, <HI>nor break the
Laws;</HI> and they desir'd him, if he knew
such a Secret, he would communicate it
to them, and they would be sure to <HI>re∣member
to forget him for it as long as he
liv'd.</HI></P>
<P>He frankly told them <HI>he had said so,
and it was true,</HI> he could put them in a
way to do all this if they would follow
his Directions. <HI>What's that, says one</HI> of the
most earnest Enquirers?—'Tis inclu∣ded
in one Word, says he, UNITE.</P>
<P>This most significant Word, deeply
and solidly reflected upon, put them up∣on
strange and various Conjectures, and
many long Debates they had with them∣selves
about it; at last they came again
to him, and ask'd him <HI>what he mean't by it?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254"/>
He told them he knew they were
<HI>Strangers to the meaning</HI> of the thing,
and therefore if they would meet him
the next Day he would come prepar'd
to explain himself; accordingly they
meet, when instead of a long Speech
they expected from him what sort of
Union he mean't, <HI>and with who,</HI> he brings
them a <HI>Thinking Press,</HI> or <HI>Cogitator,</HI> and
setting it down, goes away without
speaking one Word.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hyerogliphical</HI> Admonition was
too plain not to <HI>let them all into his mean∣ing;</HI>
but still as they are an obstinate
People, and not a little valuing them∣selves
upon their own Knowledge and
Penetration, they slighted the Engine
and fell to off-hand-<HI>Surmises, Guesses</HI> and
<HI>Supposes.</HI></P>
<P>1. Some concluded he mean't <HI>Ʋnit
with the Solunarian Church,</HI> and they re∣flected
upon his Understanding, that not
being the Question in Hand, and some∣thing
remote from their Intention, or
the High <HI>Solunarians</HI> Desire.</P>
<P>2. Some mean't Ʋnite to the moderate
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
Party of the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> and this they
said they had done already.</P>
<P>At last some <HI>being very Cunning,</HI> found
it it out, that it must be his meaning
<HI>Ʋnite one among another;</HI> and even there
again they misunderstood him too; and
some imagin'd he mean't down right
Rebellion, Uniting Power, and Mobbing
the whole Moon, <HI>but he soon convinc'd
them of that too.</HI></P>
<P>At last they took the Hint, that his
Advice directed them <HI>to Ʋnite their sub∣divided
Parties</HI> into one general Interest,
and to act in Concert upon one bottom,
to lay aside the Selfish, Narrow, <HI>Suspi∣cious
Spirit;</HI> three Qualifications <HI>the Cro∣lians</HI>
were but too justly charg'd with,
and begin to act with Courage, Unani∣mity
and Largeness of Soul, to open
their Eyes to their own Interest, main∣tain
a regular and constant Correspon∣dence
with one another in all parts of
the Kingdom, and <HI>to bring their civil
Interest into a Form.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of this Advice having
thus brought them to understand, and
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
prove his Proposal, they demanded his
assistance for making the Eassay, and 'tis
a most wonderful thing to consider what
a strange effect the alteration of their
Measures had upon the whole <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Nation.</P>
<P>As soon as ever they had settled
the Methods they resolv'd to act in,
they form'd <HI>a general Council</HI> of the Heads
of their Party, to be always sitting, to
reconcile Differences, to unite Parties,
to suppress Feuds in their beginning.</P>
<P>They appointed 3 <HI>general Meetings</HI> in 3
of the most remote Parts of the Kingdom,
to be half yearly, and <HI>one universal Meet∣ing</HI>
of Persons deputed to concert mat∣ters
among them in General.</P>
<P>By that time these Meetings had sat
but once, and the Conduct of the Coun∣cil
of 12 began to appear, 'twas a won∣der
to see the prodigious alteration it
made all over the Country.</P>
<P>Immediately <HI>a Crolian</HI> would <HI>never
buy any thing</HI> but of a <HI>Crolian;</HI> would
hire no Servants, employ neither Porter
nor Carman, but what were <HI>Crolians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="257"/>
The <HI>Crolians</HI> in the Country that
wrought and manag'd the Manufa∣ctures,
would employ no body but <HI>Cro∣lian
Spinners, Crolian Weavers,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P>In their capital City the Merchandiz∣ing
<HI>Crolians</HI> would freight no Ships but
of which the Owners and Commanders
were <HI>Crolians.</HI></P>
<P>They call'd all their Cash out of the
<HI>Solunarian Bank;</HI> and as the Act of the
<HI>Cortez</HI> confirming the Bank then in
being seem'd to be their Support, they
made it plain that Cash and Credit will
make a Bank without a publick Settle∣ment
of Law; <HI>and without these</HI> all the
Laws in the <HI>Moon</HI> will never be able to
support it.</P>
<P>They brought all their running Cash
into one Bank, and settled a sub-Cash
depending upon the Grand-Bank in eve∣ry
Province of the Kingdom; in which,
by a strict Correspondence and credit∣ing
their Bills, they might be able to set∣tle
a Paper Credit over the whole Na∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="258"/>
They went on to settle themselves in
all sorts of Trade in open Companies,
and sold off their Interests in the publick
Stocks then in Trade.</P>
<P>If the Government wanted a Million
of Mony upon any Emergency, they
were ready to lend it as a Body, not by
different Sums and private Hands blend∣ed
together with their Enemies, but as
will appear at large presently, <HI>it was on∣ly
Crolian Mony,</HI> and pass'd as such.</P>
<P>Nor were the Consequences of this
<HI>New Model</HI> less considerable than the
Proposer expected, for the <HI>Crolians</HI> be∣ing
generally of the Trading Manufa∣cturing
part of the World, and <HI>very
Rich;</HI> the influence this method had up∣on
the common People, upon Trade, and
upon the Publick was very considerable
every way.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. All the <HI>Solunarian Trades-Men</HI> and <HI>Shop∣keepers</HI>
were at their Wits end, they sat in
their Shops and had little or nothing to
do, while the Shops of the <HI>Crolians</HI> were
full of Customers, and their People o∣ver
Head and Ears in Business; this
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
turn'd many of the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Trades∣Men
quite off <HI>of the hooks,</HI> and they be∣gan
to break and decay strangely, till at
last a great many of them to prevent
their utter Ruin, turn'd <HI>Crolians</HI> on pur∣pose
to get a Trade; and what forward∣ed
that part of it was, that when <HI>a So∣lunarian,</HI>
who had little or no Trade be∣fore,
came but over to <HI>the Crolians,</HI> im∣mediately
every Body come to Trade
with him, and his Shop would be full of
Customers, so that this presently en∣creas'd
the number of the <HI>Crolians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The poor People in the Countries,
<HI>Carders, Spinners, Weavers, Knitters,</HI>
and all sorts of <HI>Manufacturers,</HI> run in
Crowds to the <HI>Crolian Temples</HI> for fear of
being starv'd, for the <HI>Crolians</HI> were two
thirds of the Masters or Employers in the
Manufactures all over the Country, and
the Poor would ha' been starv'd and un∣done
if they had cast them out of Work.
Thus insensibly the <HI>Crolians</HI> encreas'd
their number.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P>3. The <HI>Crolians</HI> being Men of <HI>vast Cash,</HI>
they no sooner withdrew <HI>their Mony</HI> from
the <HI>General Bank</HI> but the Bank <HI>languisht,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
Credit <HI>sunk,</HI> and in a short time they
had little to do, but <HI>dissolv'd</HI> of Course.</P>
<P>One thing remain'd which People ex∣pected
would ha' put a Check to this
Undertaking, and that was a way of
Trading in Classes, <HI>or Societies,</HI> much
like our <HI>East-India Companies</HI> in <HI>England;</HI>
and these depending upon publick Privi∣leges
granted by the Queen of the Coun∣try,
or her Predecessors, no Body could
Trade to those Parts but the Persons
who had those Priviledges: The cunning
<HI>Crolians,</HI> who had great Stocks in those
Trades, and foresaw they could not
Trade by themselves without the pub∣lick
<HI>Grant or Charter,</HI> contriv'd a way to
get almost all that Capital Trade into
their Hands as follows.</P></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>They concerted Matters, and all at
once fell to <HI>selling off their Stock,</HI> giving
out daily Reports that they would be
<HI>no longer concern'd,</HI> that it was a losing
Trade, that the <HI>Fund at bottom was good
for nothing,</HI> and that of two Societies <HI>the
Old one</HI> had not 20 <HI>per Cont. to divide,</HI> all
their Debts being paid; that the <HI>New
Society</HI> had Traded several Years, but if
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
they were dissolv'd <HI>could not say they had
got any thing;</HI> and that this must be a
Cheat at last, and so they resolv'd to
sell.</P>
<P>By this Artifice, they daily offering to
Sale, and yet in all their Discourse <HI>dis∣couraging
the thing they were to sell,</HI> no Bo∣dy
could be found to buy.</P>
<P>The offering a thing to Sale and no
Bidders, is a certain never-failing pro∣spect of <HI>a lowring the Price;</HI> from this
Method therefore the value of all the
Banks, Companies, Societies and Stocks
in the Country fell to be little or nothing
worth; and that was to be bought for
40 or 45 <HI>Lunarians</HI> that was formerly
sold at 150, and so in proportion of all
the rest.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Crolians</HI> employ'd
their Emissaries to buy up privately all
the Interest or Shares in these Things
that any of the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Party would
sell.</P>
<P><HI>This Plot took readily,</HI> for these Gen∣tlemen
exposing the weakness of
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
<HI>these Societies,</HI> and running down the
value of <HI>their Stocks,</HI> and at the same
time warily buying at the lowest Prices,
not only <HI>in time got Possession of the whole
Trade,</HI> with their Grants, Privileges
and Stocks, but got into them at a pro∣digiously
low and despicable Price.</P>
<P>They had no sooner thus worm'd them
out of the Trade, and got the greatest
part of the Effects in their own Hands,
and consequently the whole Manage∣ment,
but they run up the Price of the
Funds again as high as ever, and laught
at the folly of those that sold out.</P>
<P>Nor could the other People make any
Reflections upon the honesty of the pra∣ctise,
for it was <HI>no Original,</HI> but
had its birth among the <HI>Solunarians them∣selves,</HI>
of whom 3 or 4 had frequently
made a Trade of raising and lowring the
Funds of the Societies by all the Clan∣destine
Contrivances in the World, and
had ruin'd abundance of Families to
raise their own Fortunes and Estates.</P>
<P>One of the greatest Merchants <HI>in the
Moon</HI> rais'd himself by this Method to
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
such a heighth of Wealth, that he left
all his Children married to Grandees,
Dukes, and Great Folks; and from a
<HI>Mechanick Original,</HI> they are how rankt
among the <HI>Lunarian</HI> Nobility, while
multitudes of ruin'd Families helpt to
<HI>build his Fortune;</HI> by sinking under the
Knavery of his Contrivance.</P>
<P>His Brother in the same Iniquity, be∣ing
at this time <HI>a Man of the Feather,</HI>
has carry'd on the same intrieguing
Trade with all the <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Front</HI> ima∣ginable;
it has been nothing with him
to persuade his most intimate Friends to
<HI>Sell,</HI> or <HI>Buy,</HI> just as he had occasion for
his own Interest to have it <HI>rise,</HI> or <HI>fall,</HI>
and so to make his own Market of their
Misfortune. Thus he has <HI>twice rais'd
his Fortunes,</HI> for the <HI>House of Feathers</HI> de∣molisht
him <HI>once,</HI> and yet he has by the
same clandestine Management work'd
himself up again.</P>
<P>This <HI>civil way of Robbing Houses,</HI> for
I can esteem it no better, was carry'd
on by a middle sort of People, call'd in
the Moon BLOUTEGONDEGOURS,
<PB N="158" REF="264"/>
which signifies <HI>Men with two Tongues,</HI> or
in English, <HI>Stock-Jobbing Brokers.</HI></P>
<P>These had formerly such an unlimit∣ed
Power and were <HI>so numerous,</HI>
that in∣deed
they govern'd the whole Trade of
the Country; no Man knew when he
<HI>Bought</HI> or <HI>Sold,</HI> for tho' they pretended
to Buy and Sell, and Manage <HI>for other
Men</HI> whose Stocks they had very much
at Command, yet nothing was more
frequent than <HI>when they bought a thing
cheap,</HI> to buy it for <HI>themselves;</HI> if <HI>dear,</HI>
for their <HI>Employer;</HI> if they were to Sell,
<HI>if the Price rise,</HI> it was <HI>Sold,</HI> if it <HI>Fell,</HI>
it was <HI>Ʋnsold;</HI> and by this Art no body
got any Mony but themselves, that at
last, excepting the two <HI>capital Men</HI> we
spoke of before, these govern'd the
Prizes of all things, and nothing could
be Bought or Sold to Advantage <HI>but
thro' their Hands;</HI> and as the Profit
was prodigious, their number encreas'd
accordingly, so that Business seem'd en∣gross'd
by these Men, and they govern'd
the main Articles of Trade.</P>
<P><HI>This Success,</HI> and the <HI>Imprudence of their
Conduct,</HI> brought great Complaints a∣gainst
<PB N="159" REF="265"/>
them to the Government, and
a Law was made to <HI>restrain them,</HI> both
in Practice and <HI>Number.</HI></P>
<P>This Law has in some measure had its
Effect, the number is not only lessen'd,
but <HI>by chance</HI> some honester Men <HI>than
usual</HI> are got in among them, but they
are so <HI>very, very, very</HI> Few, hardly e∣nough
to save a Man's Credit that shall
vouch for them.</P>
<P>Nay, some People that pretend to un∣derstand
their Business better than I do,
having been of their Number, have af∣firm'd,
it is impossible to be honest in the
employment.</P>
<P>I confess when I began to search into
the Conduct of these Men, at least of
some of them, I found there were abun∣dance
of black Stories to be told of
them, a great deal known, and a great
deal more unknown; for they were from
the beginning continually Encroaching
into all sorts of People and Societies,
and in Conjunction with some that were
not qualify'd by Law, but meerly Volun∣tarily,
call'd in the Moon by a hard long
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
Word, in <HI>English</HI> signifying PROJECTORS
these erected Stocks <HI>in Shadows,</HI> Socie∣ties
<HI>in Nubibus,</HI> and Bought and Sold
meer Vapour, Wind, Emptiness and
Bluster for Mony, till they drew People
in to lay out their Cash, and then
laught at them.</P>
<P>Thus they erected Paper Societies,
Linnen Socities, Sulphur Societies, Cop∣per
Societies, Glass Societies, Sham
Banks, and a thousand mock Whimsies
to hook unwary People in; at last
sold themselves <HI>out,</HI> left the Bubble
to float a little in the Air, and then van∣ish
of it self.</P>
<P>The other sort of People <HI>go on</HI> after
all this; and tho' these Projectors began
to be out of Fashion, they always found
one thing or other to amuse and deceive
the Ignorant, and went <HI>Jobbing on</HI> into
all manner of things, Publick as well as
Private, whether the Revenue, the Pub∣lick
Funds, Loans, Annuities, <HI>Bear-Skins,</HI>
or any thing.</P>
<P>Nay they were once grown to that
extravagant highth, that they began to
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
Stock-Job the very Feathers of the Con∣solidator,
and in time the King's em∣ploying
those People might have had
what Feathers they had occasion for,
without concerning the Proprietors of the
Lands much about them.</P>
<P>'Tis true this began to be notorious,
and receiv'd some check in a former
meeting <HI>of the Feathers;</HI> but even <HI>now,</HI>
when I came away, the three Years
expiring, and by Course a new Consoli∣dator
being to be built, they were as
busie as ever. Bidding, Offering, Procur∣ing,
Buying, Selling, and Jobbing of
Feathers to who bid most; and notwith∣standing
several late wholesome and
strict Laws against all manner of Collu∣sion,
Bribery and clandestine Methods,
in the Countries procuring these Fea∣thers;
never was the Moon in such an
uproar about picking and culling the
Feathers, such Bribery, such Drunken∣ness,
such Caballing, especially among
the High <HI>Solunarian</HI> Clergy and the <HI>La∣cognians,
such Feasting,</HI> Fighting and
Distraction, as the like has never been</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="268"/>
And that which is very Remarkable,
all this not only before the Old Consoli∣dator
was broke up, but even while it
was actually whole and in use.</P>
<P>Had this hurry been to send up good
Feathers, there had been the less to say,
but that which made it very strange to me
was, that where the very worst of all the
Feathers were to be found, there was
the most of this wicked Work; and tho'
it was bad enough every where, yet the
greatest bustle and contrivance was in
order to send up the worst Feathers they
could get.</P>
<P>And indeed some Places such Sorry,
Scoundrel, Empty, Husky, Wither'd,
Decay'd Feathers were offer'd to the
Proprietors, that I have sometimes won∣der'd
any one could have the Impudence
to send up such ridiculous Feathers to
make a Consolidator, which, as is before
observ'd, is an Engine of such Beauty,
Usefulness and Necessity.</P>
<P>And still in all my Observation, this
Note came in my way, there was always
the most bustle and disturbance about
the worst Feathers.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="269"/>
It was really a melancholly Thing to
consider, and had this Lunar World
been my Native Country, I should ha' been
full of concern to see that one thing, on
which the welfare of the whole Nation
so much depended, put in so ill a Me∣thod,
and gotten into the management
of such Men, who for Mony would cer∣tainly
ha' set up such Feathers, that when∣ever
the Consolidator should be form'd,
it would certainly <HI>over-set</HI> the first
Voyage; and if the whole Nation should
happen to be Embarkt in it, <HI>on the dan∣gerous
Voyage to the Moon,</HI> the fall would
certainly give them such a Shock, as
would put them all into Confusion, and
open the Door to the <HI>Gallunarian,</HI> or any
Foreign Enemy to destroy them.</P>
<P>It was really strange that this should
be the Case, after so many Laws, and so
lately made, against it; but in this, those
People are too like our People in <HI>England,</HI>
who have the best Laws the worst exe∣cuted
of any Nation under Heaven.</P>
<P>For in the Moon this hurry about
choosing of Feathers was grown to
the greatest heighth imaginable,
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
as if it encreast by the very Laws that
were made to suppress it; for now at a
certain publick Place where the <HI>Bloute∣gondegours</HI>
us'd to meet every Day, any
Body that had but Mony enough might
buy a Feather at a reasonable Rate, and
never go down into the Country to
fetch it; nay, the Trade grew so
hot, that of a sudden as if no other Bu∣siness
was in Hand, all People were up∣on
it, and the whole Market was chang'd
from Selling of Bear-Skins, to Buying of
Feathers.</P>
<P>Some gave this for a Reason why all
the Stocks of the Societies fell so fast,
but there were other Reasons to be gi∣ven
for that, such as Clubs, Cabals,
Stock-Jobbers, Knights, Merchants and
Thie—s. I mean <HI>a private Sort,</HI> not such
as are frequently Hang'd there, but <HI>of a
worse Sort,</HI> by how much they <HI>merit that
Punishment more,</HI> but are out of the
reach of the Law, can Rob and pick
Pockets in the Face of the Sun, and
laugh at the Families they Ruin, bid∣ding

To this height things were come un∣der
the growing Evil of this sort of
People.</P>
<P>And yet in the <HI>very Moon</HI> where, as I
have noted the, People are so exceeding
<HI>clear Sighted,</HI> and have such vast helps
to their <HI>perceptive Faculties,</HI> such Mists
are sometimes cast before the publick
Understanding, that they cannot see the
general Interest.</P>
<P>This was manifest, in that just as I
came away from that Country, the
great Council of their Wise Men, <HI>the
Men of the Feather,</HI> were a going to re∣peal
the old Law of Restraining the
Number of these People; and tho' <HI>as it
was,</HI> there was not Employment for half
of them, there being 100 in all, and not
above 5 honest ones; yet when I came
away they were going to encrease their
Number. I have nothing to say to this
here, only that all Wise Men that <HI>under∣stand
Trade</HI> were very much concern'd at
it, and lookt upon it as a most <HI>destru∣ctive
Thing to the Publick,</HI> and forboding
the same mischiefs that Trade suffer'd
before.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="272"/>
It was the particular Misfortune to
these Lunar People that this Country
had a better Stock of Governors in all
Articles of their Well-fare, than in
their Trade; their Law Affairs had good
Judges, their Church good Patriarchs,
<HI>except, as might be excepted;</HI> their <HI>State</HI>
good <HI>Ministers,</HI> their <HI>Army</HI> good <HI>Gene∣rals;</HI>
and their <HI>Consolidator</HI> good <HI>Fea∣thers;</HI>
but in Matters relating to Trade,
they had this particular Misfortune,
that those Cases always came before
People <HI>that did not understand them.</HI></P>
<P>Even the Judges themselves were of∣ten
found at a Loss to determine Causes
of Negoce, such as <HI>Protests, Charter-Par∣ties,
Avarages, Baratry, Demorage</HI> of Ships,
Right of <HI>detaining Vessels</HI> on Demorage,
and the like; nay, the very Laws them∣selves
are fain to be silent and yield in
many things a Superiority to <HI>the Custom
of Merchants.</HI></P>
<P>And here I began to <HI>Congratulate my
Native Country,</HI> where the Prudence of
the Government has provided for these
things, by Establishing in <HI>a Commission
of Trade</HI> some of the <HI>most experienc'd Gen∣tlemen
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
in the Nation,</HI> to Regulate, Settle,
Improve, and revive Trade in General,
by their unwearyed Labours, and <HI>most
consummate Ʋnderstanding;</HI> and this made
me pity these Countries, and think it
would be an Action worthy of this Na∣tion,
and be spoken of <HI>for Ages to come</HI>
to their Glory, if in <HI>meer Charity</HI> they
would appoint or depute <HI>these Gentle∣men</HI>
to go a Voyage to those Countries
<HI>of the Moon,</HI> and bless those Regions
with the Schemes of their sublime Un∣dertakings,
<HI>and discoveries in Trade.</HI></P>
<P>But when I was expressing my self
thus, my Philosopher interrupted me,
and told me I should see they were al∣ready
furnisht for that purpose, when I
came to examine the publick Libraries,
<HI>of which by it self.</HI></P>
<P>But I was farther confirm'd in my
Observation of the weakness of the <HI>pub∣lick
Heads</HI> of that Country, <HI>as to Trade,</HI>
when I saw another most preposterous
Law going forward among them, the Ti∣tle
of which was specious, and contain'd
something relating <HI>to employing the Poor,</HI>
but the substance of it <HI>absolutely destructive</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
to the very Nature of their Trade, tend∣ed
to Transposing, <HI>Confounding</HI> and De∣stroying
their Manufactures, and to the
Ruin of all their <HI>Home-Commerce;</HI> never
was Nation so blind to their own Inte∣rest
as these <HI>Lunarian Law Makers,</HI> and
the People who were the Contrivers of
this Law were so <HI>vainly Conceited,</HI> so fond
of <HI>the guilded Title,</HI> and so <HI>positively Dog∣matick,</HI>
that they would not hear the fre∣quent
Applications of Persons better ac∣quainted
with those things than them∣selves,
but pusht it on meerly <HI>by the
strength of their Party,</HI> for the Vanity of
being Authors of such a Contrivance.</P>
<P>But to return to the new Model of
the <HI>Crolians.</HI> The advice of the <HI>Luna∣rian</HI>
Philosopher run now thro' all their
Affairs, UNITE <HI>was the Word</HI> thro'
all the Nation, in Trade, in Cash, in
Stocks, as I noted before.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Solunarian</HI> Ship was bound to a∣ny
<HI>Out Port,</HI> no <HI>Crolian</HI> would load any
Goods aboard; if any Ship came to seek
Freight abroad, none of the <HI>Crolians</HI>
Correspondents would Ship any thing
unless they knew the Owners <HI>were Cro∣lians;</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
the <HI>Crolian Merchants</HI> turn'd out
all their <HI>Solunarian Masters, Sailors</HI> and
<HI>Captains</HI> from their Ships; and thus, as
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> would have them be se∣parated
in respect of the Government,
<HI>Profits, Honours</HI> and <HI>Offices,</HI> they resolv'd
to separate in <HI>every thing else</HI> too, and
to stand by themselves.</P>
<P>At last, upon some publick Occasion,
the publick <HI>Treasurers</HI> of the Land sent
to the capital City, to borrow 500000
<HI>Lunarians</HI> upon very good Security of
establisht Funds; <HI>truly no Body would lend
any Mony,</HI> or at least they could not raise
above a 5th part of that Sum, enquiring
<HI>at the Bank,</HI> at their general <HI>Societies Cash,</HI>
and other Places, all was <HI>languid</HI> and
<HI>dull,</HI> and <HI>no Mony to be had;</HI> but being
inform'd that the <HI>Crolians</HI> had erected a
Bank of their own, they <HI>sent thither,</HI>
and were answered <HI>readily,</HI> that whate∣ver
Sum the Governnment wanted, was at
their Service, only it was to be lent not
by particular Persons, but <HI>such a Grandee</HI>
being one of the prime Nobility, and
who <HI>the Crolians</HI> now call'd their Pro∣tector,
was to be <HI>Treated with about it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="276"/>
<HI>The Goverment saw no harm in all
this,</HI> here was no Law broken, here was
nothing but Oppression answered with
Policy, and Mischief fenc'd against with
Reason.</P>
<P>The Government therefore took no
Notice of it, <HI>nor made any Scruple when
they wanted any Mony</HI> to Treat with this
Nobleman, and borrow any Sum <HI>of the
Crolians,</HI> as <HI>Crolians;</HI> on the contrary in
the Name of the <HI>Crolians;</HI> their <HI>Head or
Protector</HI> presented their <HI>Addresses</HI> and
<HI>Petitions,</HI> procur'd Favours on one
Hand, and Assistance on the other; and
thus <HI>by degrees</HI> and <HI>insensibly</HI> the <HI>Crolians</HI>
became <HI>a Politick Body,</HI> settled and esta∣blish'd
by Orders and Rules among them∣selves;
and while <HI>a Spirit of Ʋnanimity</HI>
thus run thro' all their Proceedings, <HI>their
Enemies could never hurt them,</HI> their Prin∣ces
always saw it was <HI>their Interest</HI> to
keep Measures with them, and they
were sure to have Justice upon any Com∣plaint
whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>When I saw this,</HI> it forc'd me to reflect
upon Affairs in our own Country; <HI>Well,
said I,</HI> 'tis happy for <HI>England</HI> that our
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
<HI>Dissenters</HI> have not this Spirit of <HI>Union,</HI>
and Largeness of Heart among them;
for if they were not a <HI>Narrow,</HI> mean-<HI>Spi∣rieted,</HI>
short-<HI>Sighted, self-Preserving, friend∣Betraying,
poor-Neglecting People,</HI> they
might ha' been every way as Safe, as
Considerable, as Regarded and as Nu∣merous
as the <HI>Crolians</HI> in the <HI>Moon;</HI> but
it is not in their Souls to do themselves
Good, nor to Espouse, or Stand by those
that would do it for them; and 'tis well
for the Church-Men that it is so, for ma∣ny
Attempts have been made to save
them, but their own narrowness of
Soul, and dividedness in Interest has
always prevented its being effectual, and
discoutag'd all the Instruments that e∣ver
attempted to serve them.</P>
<P>'Tis confest the Case was thus at first
among the <HI>Crolians,</HI> they were full of
Divisions among themselves, as I have
noted already of the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> and
the unhappy Feuds among them,
had always not only expos'd them to
the Censure, Reproach and Banter of
their <HI>Solunarian</HI> Enemies, but it had
serv'd to keep them under, prevent their
being valued in the Government, and
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
given the other Party vast Advantages
against.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Solunarians</HI> driving thus furi∣ously
<HI>at their Destruction</HI> and entire Ru∣in,
open'd their Eyes to the following
Measures for their preservation: And
here again <HI>the high Solunarians</HI> may see,
and doubtless whenever they made use
of the Lunar-Glasses they must see it,
that nothing could ha' driven the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
to make use of such Methods for
their Defence, but the rash Proceedings
of their own warm Men, in order to
suppressing the whole <HI>Crolian</HI> Interest.
And this might inform our Country∣men
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that it
cannot but be their Interest to Treat
their Brethren with Moderation and
Temper, least their Extravagances
should one time or other drive the other
as it were by Force into their Senses, and
open their Eyes to do only all those
Things which by Law they may do, and
which they are laught at by all the World
for not doing.</P>
<P>This was the very Case in the Moon:
The Philosopher, <HI>or pretended-such as be∣sore,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
had often publish'd, that <HI>it was
their Interest to</HI> UNITE; bur their Eyes
not being open to the true Causes and
Necessity of it, their Ears were shut a∣gainst
the Council, <HI>till Oppression and Ne∣cessities
drove them to it.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly they entred into a serious
Debate, of the State of their own Af∣fairs,
and finding the Advice given, ve∣ry
reasonable; they set about it, and
the Author gave them a Model, En∣titl'd
<HI>An enquiry into what the Crolians may
lawfully do, to prevent the certain Ruin of
their Interest, and bring their Enemies to
Peace.</HI></P>
<P>I will not pretend to examine the
Contents of this sublime Tract; but
from this very Day, we found the <HI>Cro∣lians</HI>
in the Moon, acting quite on a
different Foot from all their former
Conduct, putting on a new Temper,
and a new Face, as you have hear'd.</P>
<P>All this while the hot <HI>Solunarians</HI> cri∣ed
out <HI>Plots, Associations, Confederacies</HI>
and <HI>Rebellions,</HI> when indeed here was
nothing done but what the <HI>Laws justi∣fy'd,</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
what <HI>Reason directed,</HI> and what <HI>had
the Crolians but made use of the Cogitator,</HI>
they would ha' done 40 Year before.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the other People had
no Remedy, but <HI>to cry Murther,</HI> and
make <HI>a</HI> Noise; for the <HI>Crolians</HI> went on
with their Affairs, and Establisht them∣selves
so, that when I came away, they
were become a most Solid, and well
United Body, made a considerable Fi∣gure
in the Nation, and yet the Govern∣ment
was easy; for the <HI>Solunarians</HI> found
when they had attain'd the utmost end
of their Wishes, her <HI>Solunarian Majesty</HI>
was as safe as before, and the <HI>Crolians</HI>
Property being secur'd, they were as
Loyal Subjects as the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> as
consistent with Monarchy, as useful to
it, and <HI>as pleas'd with it.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but Remark here, that
this <HI>Ʋnion of the Crolians</HI> among them∣selves
had another Consequence, which
made it appear it was not only to their
own Advantage, but to the general
Good of all the Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="281"/>
For, <HI>by little, and little,</HI> the Feuds of
the Parties cool'd, and the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
began to be better reconcil'd to them;
the Government was <HI>easy and sase,</HI> and
the private Quarrels, as I have been told
since, begin to be quite forgot.</P>
<P>What Blindness, <HI>said I to my self,</HI> has
possest the Dissenters in our unhappy
Country of <HI>England,</HI> where by eternal
<HI>Discords, Feuds, Distrusts</HI> and a∣mong
themselves, they always fill their
Enemies with <HI>Disgusts</HI> Hopes, that by pushing
at them, they may one time or other
compleat their Ruin; which Expecta∣tion
has always serv'd as a means to
keep open the Quarrel; whereas had
the Dissenters been United in <HI>Interest,
Affection</HI> and <HI>Mannagement</HI> among them∣selves,
all this Heat had long ago <HI>been
over,</HI> and the Nation, tho' there had
been <HI>two Opinions</HI> had retain'd but <HI>one
Interest,</HI> been joyn'd in Affection, and
<HI>Peace at Home been rais'd</HI> up to that De∣gree
that all Wise Men wish, as it is
now among the Inhabitants of the
World in the Moon.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="282"/>
'Tis true, in all the Observations I
made in this Lunar Country, the vast
deference paid to the Persons of Princes
began to lessen, and whatever Respect
they had for the <HI>Office,</HI> they found it ne∣cessary
frequently to tell the World that
<HI>on occasion,</HI> they could Treat them with
less Respect than <HI>they pretended to own
them.</HI></P>
<P>For about this time, the <HI>Divine Right</HI>
of Kings, and the Inheritances of Prin∣ces
<HI>in the Moon,</HI> met with a terrible
Shock, and that by the <HI>Solunarian Party
themselves;</HI> and insomuch that even my
Philosopher, and he was none of the <HI>Jure
Divino Men,</HI> neither declar'd, against it.</P>
<P>They made <HI>Crowns perfect Foot-balls,</HI>
set up what Kings they would, and
<HI>pull'd down</HI> such as they did not like, <HI>Rati∣tione
Voluntas,</HI> right or wrong, as they
thought best, of which some Examples
shall be given by and by.</P>
<P>After I had thus enquir'd into the Hi∣storical
Affairs of this Lunar Nation,
which for its Similitude to my Native
Country, I could not but be inquisitive
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
in; I wav'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>great many material Things,
which at least I cannot enter upon the
Relation of here, and began to enquire
into their Affairs abroad.</P>
<P>I think I took notice in the beginning
of my Account of these Parts, that I
found them engag'd in a tedious and
bloody War, with one of the most
mighty Monarchs of all the Moon.</P>
<P>I must therefore hint, that among the
multitude of things, which for brevity
sake I omit, the Reader may observe
these were some.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That this was the same Monarch
who harbour'd and entertain'd the <HI>Abro∣gratzian</HI>
Prince, who was fled as be∣fore,
and who we are to call the King
of <HI>Gallunaria.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I have omitted the Account of a
long and bloody War, which lasted a
great many Years, and which the present
Queens Predecessor, mannag'd with a
great deal of Bravery and Conduct, and
finisht very much to his own Glory, and
the Nations Advantage.</ITEM>
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
<ITEM>3. I have too much omitted to Note,
how <HI>Barbarously</HI> the <HI>High Solunarian
Church Men</HI> treated him for all his Ser∣vices,
upbraided him with the Expence
of the War; and tho' he sav'd them all
from Ruin and <HI>Abrogratzianism,</HI> yet had
not one good Word for him, and in∣deed
'tis with some difficulty that I pass
this over, because it might be necessary
to observe, besides what is said before,
that Ingratitude is a Vice in Nature, and
practis'd every where, as well as in <HI>En∣gland.</HI>
So that we need not upbraid the <HI>Par∣ty</HI>
among us with their ill Treatment of
the late King, for these People us'd their
good King every Jot as bad, till their
unkindness perfectly broke his Heart.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here also I am oblig'd to omit the
Historical Part of the War, and of the
Peace that follow'd; only I must ob∣serve
that this Peace was very <HI>Precarious,</HI>
Short and <HI>Ʋnhappy,</HI> and in a few Months
the War broke out again, with as much
Fury as ever.</P>
<P>In this War happen'd one of the strang∣est,
unaccountable and most preposte∣rous
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
Actions, that ever a People in their
National Capacity could be guilty of.</P>
<P>Certainly if our People in <HI>England,</HI>
who pretend that Kingship is <HI>Jure Di∣vino,</HI>
did but know the Story of which
I speak, they would be quite of another
Mind; wherefore I crave leave to re∣late
part of the History, or Original of
this last War, as a necessary Introdu∣ction
to the proper Observations I shall
make upon it.</P>
<P>There was a King of a certain Country
in the Moon, call'd in their Language,
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> who was formerly a Confede∣rate
with the <HI>Solunarians.</HI> This Prince
dying without Issue, the great Monarch
we speak of, seiz'd upon all his Domi∣nions
as his Right.—Tho' if I remem∣ber
right, he had formerly Sworn never
to lay Claim to it, and after that by a
subsequent Treaty had agreed with the
<HI>Solunarian</HI> Prince, that another Monarch
who claim'd a Right as well as he,
should divide it between them.</P>
<P>The breach of this Agreement, and
seizing this Kingdom, put almost all the
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
Lunar World into a Flame, and War
hung over the Heads of all the Nor∣thern
Nations of the Moon, for seve∣ral
Claims were made to the Succession
by other Princes, and particularly by a
certain Potent Prince call'd the <HI>Eagle,</HI> of
an Ancient Family, whose <HI>Lunar</HI> Name
I cannot well express, but in <HI>English,</HI> it
signifies <HI>the Men of the great Lip;</HI> whe∣ther
it was Originally a sort of a Nick
Name, or whether they had any such
thing as a great Lip Hereditary to the
Family, by which they were distin∣guisht,
is not worth my while to Exa∣mine.</P>
<P>'Tis without question that the succes∣sive
Right, <HI>if their Lunar Successions, are
Govern'd as ours are in this World,</HI> devolv'd
upon this Man <HI>with the Lip</HI> and his Fa∣milies;
but the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch
brought things so to pass, by his extraor∣dinary
Conduct, that the <HI>Ebronian</HI> King
was drawn in by some of his Nobility,
<HI>who this Prince had Bought</HI> and Brib'd to be∣tray
their Country to his Interest, and
particularly a certain <HI>High Priest</HI> of that
Country, to make an Assignment, or <HI>deed
of Gift</HI> of all his Dominions to the
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
Grandson of this <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch.</P>
<P><HI>By Vertue of this Gift,</HI> or Legacy, as
soon as the King dyed, who was then
languishing, and as the other Party al∣ledg'd,
not in <HI>a very good capacity to make
a Will;</HI> the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King sent his
Grandson to seize upon the Crown, and
backing him with suitable Forces, took
Possession of all his strong Fortifications
and Frontiers.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, <HI>the Man with the Lip</HI>
indeed talkt big, and threatned War
immediately, but the <HI>Solunarians</HI> were
so unsettl'd at Home, so unprepar'd for
War, having but just dismist their Auxi∣liar
Troops, and disbanded their own,
and the Prince was so ill serv'd by his
Subjects, that both he and a Powerful
Neighbour, Nations in the same Inte∣rest,
were meerly Bullyed by this <HI>Gallu∣narian;</HI>
and as he threatned immediate∣ly
to Invade them, which they were
then in no Condition to prevent, he
forc'd them both to submit to his De∣mand,
<HI>tacitely allow</HI> what he had done
in breaking the Treaty with him, and
at last openly <HI>acknowledge</HI> his new King.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="288"/>
<HI>This was indeed a most unaccountable Step,</HI>
but there was a necessity to plead, for
he was at their very Doors with his For∣ces;
and this Neighbouring People, who
they call <HI>Mogenites,</HI> could not resist him
without help from the <HI>Solunarians,</HI>
which they were very backward in,
notwithstanding the <HI>earnest Sollicitations
of their Prince,</HI> and notwithstanding they
were oblig'd to do it <HI>by a solemn Trea∣ty</HI></P>
<P>These delays oblig'd them to this strange
Step of <HI>acknowledging</HI> the Invasion of
their Enemy, and <HI>pulling off the Hat</HI> to
the New King he had set up.</P>
<P><HI>'Tis true,</HI> the Policy of these Lunar Na∣tions
was very Remarkable in this Case,
and they out-witted the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Mo∣narch
in it; for by the owning this
Prince, whom they immediately after
<HI>Declar'd a Ʋsurper,</HI> and made War a∣gainst;
they stopt the Mouth of the
<HI>Gallunarian</HI> his Grandfather, took from
him all pretence of Invading them,
and <HI>making him believe they were Sincere,</HI>
Wheedl'd him to restore several Thou∣sands
of their Men who he had taken
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
Prisoners in the Frontier Towns of the
<HI>Ebronians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Had the</HI> Gallunarian Prince had but
the forecast to ha' seen, that this was
but a for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d pretence to gain Time, and
that as soon as they had <HI>their Troops clear</HI>
and Time to raise more, they would
certainly turn upon him again, he
would never ha' been put by with so
weak a Trifle as the <HI>Ceremony of Congra∣tulation;</HI>
whereas had he immediately
pusht at them with all his Forces, they
must ha' been Ruin'd, and he had car∣ry'd
his Point without much Interrup∣tion.</P>
<P>But here he lost his Opportunity,
which he never retriev'd; <HI>for 'tis in the
Moon, just as 'tis here,</HI> when an Occasion is
lost, it is not easy to be recover'd, for both
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the <HI>Mogenites</HI> quickly
threw off the Mask, and declaring this
new Prince an <HI>Ʋsurper,</HI> and his Grand∣father
an <HI>Ʋnjust breaker of Treaties,</HI> they
prepar'd for War against them both.</P>
<P>As to the Honesty of this matter, my
Philosopher and I differ'd extremely, he
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
exclaim'd against the Honour of acknow∣ledging
a King, with a design to Depose
him, and pretending Peace when War
is design'd; tho' 'tis true, they are too
customary in our World; but however,
as to him I insisted upon the lawfulness
of it, from the universal Custom of Na∣tions,
who generally do things ten times
more Preposterous and Inconsistent,
when they suit their Occasions. Yet I
hope no Body will think I am recom∣mending
them by this Relation to the
Practice of our own Nations, but rather
exposing them as unaccountable things
never to be put in Practice, without
quitting all pretences to Justice and na∣tional
Honesty.</P>
<P>The Case was this.</P>
<P>As upon the Progress of Matters be∣fore
related, the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and <HI>Moge∣nites</HI>
had made a formal acknowledg∣ment
of this new Monarch, the Grand∣son
of the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King, so as I have
hinted already, they had no other de∣sign
than to Depose him, and pull him
down.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="291"/>
Accordingly, as soon as <HI>by the afore∣said
Wile</HI> they had gain'd Breath, and
furnisht themselves with Forces, they
<HI>declar'd War</HI> against both the <HI>Gallunari∣an</HI>
King, and this Grandson, and entred
into strict Confederacy with <HI>the Man of
the great Lip,</HI> who was the Monarch of
the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and who by right of <HI>Succes∣sion,</HI>
had the true Claim to the <HI>Ebroni∣an</HI>
Crowns.</P>
<P>In these Declarations they alledge that
Crowns do not <HI>descend by Gift,</HI> nor are
Kingdoms given away <HI>by Legacy,</HI> like a
Gold <HI>Ring at a Funeral,</HI> and therefore this
Young Prince could have no Right, the
former deceas'd King having <HI>no Right to
dispose it by Gift.</HI></P>
<P>I must allow, that judging by our
Reason, and the Practice in our Coun∣tries
here, <HI>on this side the Moon;</HI> this
seem'd plain, and I saw no difference in
matters of Truth there, or here, but
Right and Liberty both of Princes and
People seems to be the same in that
World, as it is in this, and upon this
account I thought the Reasons of this
War very Just, and that the Claim of
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
Right to the Succession of the <HI>Ebronian</HI>
Crown, was undoubtedly <HI>in the man
with the Lip,</HI> and his Heirs, and so far
the War was most Just, and the Design
reasonable.</P>
<P>And thus far my Lunar Companion
agreed with me, and had they gone on so,
says he, they had my good Wishes, and
my Judgment had been Witness to my
Pretences, that they were in the right.</P>
<P>But in the prosecution of this War,
says he, they went on to one of the
most Impolitick, Ridiculous, Dishonest,
and Inconsistent Actions, that ever any
Nation, in the Moon was guilty of; the
Fact was thus.</P>
<P>Having agreed among themselves that
the <HI>Ebronian</HI> Crown should not be pos∣sest
by the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King's Grandson,
they in the next Place began to consider
who should have it.</P>
<P><HI>The Man with the Lip had the Title,</HI> but
he had a great Government of his own,
Powerful, Happy and Remote, being as
is noted, the Lord of the great <HI>Eagle,</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
and he told them he could not pretend
<HI>to come to Ebronia to be a King there;</HI> his
eldest Son truly was not only declar'd
Heir apparent to his Father, but had
another <HI>Lunarian Kingdom</HI> of his own
still more remote than that, and he
would not quit all this for the Crown of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> so it was concerted by all the
Confederated Parties, that the <HI>second
Son</HI> of this Prince, <HI>the man with the Lip,</HI>
should be declar'd King, and here lay
the Injustice of all the Case.</P>
<P>I confess at my first examining this
Matter, I did not see far into it, nor
could I reach the Dishonesty of it, and
perhaps the Reader of these Sheets may
be in the same Case; but my old <HI>Luna∣rian
Friend</HI> being continually exclaiming
against the Matter, and blaming his Coun∣try-men
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> for the Disho∣nesty,
of it, but especially the <HI>Mogenites,</HI>
he began to be something peevish with
me that I should be so dull as not to
reach it, and askt me if he should screw
me into the <HI>Thinking-Press</HI> for the Clear∣ing
up my Understanding.</P>
<P>At last he told me he would write his
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
particular Sentiments of this whole Af∣fair
in a Letter to me, which he would
so order as it should <HI>effectually open mine
Eyes;</HI> which indeed it did, and so I be∣lieve
it will the Eyes of all that read it;
to which purpose I have obtain'd of the
Author <HI>to assist me in the Translation</HI> of it,
he having some Knowledge also in our
<HI>Sublunar Languages.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Sustance if a Letter, wrote to the Au∣thor
of these Sheets, while he was in the
Regions of the Moon.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Friend from the Moon,</OPENER>
<P>“ACcording to my promise, I hereby
give you a Scheme of <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Honesty, join'd with <HI>Mogenite</HI> Policy,
and my Opinion of the Action of my
Country-men and their Confederates,
in declaring their new made <HI>Ebronian</HI>
King.”</P>
<P>“The <HI>Mogenites</HI> and <HI>Solunarians</HI> are
look'd upon here to be the Original
Contrivers of this ridiculous piece of
Pageantry, and tho' some of their
Neighbours are suppos'd to have a
Hand in it, yet we all lay it at the
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>
door of their Politicks, and for the Ho∣nesty
of it let them answer it if they
can.”</P>
<P>“'Tis observ'd here, that as soon as
the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> had declar'd
that he accepted the Will and Disposi∣tion
of the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> in fa∣vour
of his Grandson, and that ac∣cording
to the said Disposition, he
had own'd him for King; and in or∣der
to make it effectual, had put him
into immediate Possession of the King∣dom.
The <HI>Mogenites</HI> and their Confede∣rates
made wonderful Clamours at the
Injustice of his Proceedings, and par∣ticularly
on account of his breaking
the Treaty then lately entred into
with the King of the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the
<HI>Mogenites,</HI> for the settling the Matter of
Right and Possession, in case of the De∣mise
of the <HI>Ebronian</HI> King.”</P>
<P>“However, the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> had
no sooner plac'd his Grandson on the
Throne, but the <HI>Mogenites</HI> and other
Nations, and <HI>to all our Wonder,</HI> the
King of <HI>Solunaria</HI> himself acknowledg'd
him, own'd him, sent their Minsters,
<PB N="290" REF="296"/>
and Compliments of Congratulation,
and the like, giving him the Title of
King of <HI>Ebronia.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Tho' this proceeding had something
of Surprize in it, and all Men expect∣ed
to see something more than ordina∣ry
Politick in the effect of it, yet it
did not give half the astonishment to
the Lunar World, as this unaccounta∣ble
Monster of Politicks begins to
do.”</P>
<P>“We have here two unlucky Fellows,
call'd <HI>Pasquin</HI> and <HI>Marforio,</HI> these had a
long Dialogue about this very Matter,
and <HI>Pasquin</HI> as he always lov'd Mischief,
told a very unlucky Story to his Com∣rade,
of a high <HI>Mogenite</HI> Skipper, as fol∣lows.”</P>
<P>“A <HI>Mogenite</HI> Ship coming from a far
Country, the Custom House Officers
found some Goods on Board, which
were Controband, and for which they
pretended the Ship and Goods were
all Confiscated; the Skipper, or <HI>Cap∣tain</HI>
in a great Fright, comes up to the
Custom-House, and being told he must
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
Swear to something relating to his
taking in those Goods, reply'd in his
Country <HI>Jargon, Ta-dat sall Ick doen
Myn Heer;</HI> or in <HI>English, Ay, Ay, I'll
Swear.</HI>—But finding they did not as∣sure
him that it would clear his Ship
he scruples the Oath again, at which
they told him it would clear his Ship
immediately. <HI>Hael, well Myn Heer,</HI>
says the <HI>Mogen</HI> Man, <HI>vat mot Ick sagen,
Ick sall all Swear myn Skip to salvare,</HI> i. e.
I shall Swear any thing to save my
Skip.”</P>
<P>“We apply this Story thus.”</P>
<P>“If the <HI>Mogenites</HI> did acknowledge the
King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> we did believe it was
done <HI>to save the Skip;</HI> and when they
reproacht the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King, with
breaking the Treaty of Division, we
us'd to say we would all break thro'
twice as many Engagements for half as
much Advantage.”</P>
<P>“This setting up a new King, a∣gainst
a King on the Throne, Acknow∣ledg'd
and Congratulated by them, is
not only look'd on in the Lunar World,
<PB N="292" REF="298"/>
as a thing Ridiculous, but particularly
Infamous, that they should first acknow∣ledge
a King, and then set up the Ti∣tle
of another. If the Title of the
first <HI>Ebronian</HI> King be good, this must
be an Impostor, an Usurper of another
Man's Right; if it was not good, why
did they acknowledge him, and give
him the full Title of all the <HI>Ebronian</HI>
Dominions? Caress and Congratulate
him, and make a publick Action of
it to his Ambassador.”</P>
<P>“Will they tell us they were Bully'd,
and Frighted into it? that is to own
they may be hufft into an ill Action; for
owning a Man in the Possession of what
is none of his own, is an ill thing, and he
that may be hufft into one ill Action,
may by Consequence be hufft into ano∣ther,
and so into any thing.”</P>
<P>“What will they say for doing it? we
have heard there has been in the
World you came from, a way found
out to own Kings <HI>de Facto,</HI> but not <HI>de
Jure;</HI> if they will fly to that ridiculous
Shift, let them tell the World so, that
we may know what they mean, for
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
those foolish things are not known
here.”</P>
<P>“If they own'd the King of <HI>Ebronia</HI>
voluntarily, and acknowledg'd his Right
as we thought they had; how then
can this young Gentleman have a Ti∣tle,
unless they have found out a new
Division, and so will have two Kings
of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> make them Partners, and
have a <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> and
a <HI>Mogenite</HI> King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> both toge∣ther?”</P>
<P>“Our Lunar Nations, Princes and
States, whatever they may do in your
World, always seek for some Pretences
at least to make their Actions seem
Honest, whither they are so or no;
and therefore they generally publish
Memorials, Manifesto's and Decla∣rations,
of their Reasons why, and
on what account they do so, or so;
that those who have any Grounds to
charge them with Unjustice, may be
answer'd, and silenc'd; 'tis for the
People in your Country, to fall upon
their Neighbours, only because they
will do it, and make probability of
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
Conquest, a sufficient Reason of Con∣quest;
the <HI>Lunarian</HI> Nations are
seldom so destitute of Modesty, but
that they will make a shew of Justice,
and make out the Reasons of their Pro∣ceedings;
and tho' sometimes we find
even the Reasons given for some A∣ctions
are weak enough; yet it is a
bad Cause indeed, that can neither
have a true Reason, nor a pretended
one. The custom of the Moon has o∣blig'd
us to show so much respect to
Honesty, that when our Actions
have the least colour of Honesty, yet
we will make Reasons to look like a
Defence, whether it be so or no.”</P>
<P>“But here is an Action that has nei∣ther
reality, nor pretence, here is not
Face enough upon it to bear an Apolo∣gy.
First, they acknowledge one King,
and then set up another King against
him; either they first acknowledg'd a
wrong King, and thereby became Par∣ties
to a Usurper, or they act now a∣gainst
all the Rules of common Justice
in the World, to set up a sham King,
to pull down a true one, only because
'tis their Interest to have it so.”</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="301"/>
“This makes the very Name of a <HI>So∣lunarian</HI>
scandalous to all the Moon,
and Mankind look upon them with the
utmost Prejudice, as if they were a
Nation who had sold all their Honesty
to their Interest; and who could act
this way to Day, and that way to Mor∣row,
without any regard to Truth, or
the Rule of Honour, Equity or Con∣science;
<HI>This is Swearing any thing to
save the Skip;</HI> and never let any Man
Reproach the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King with
breaking the Treaty of Division, and
disregarding the Faith and Stipulations
of Leagues; for this is an Action so in∣consistent
with it self, so incongruous
to common Justice, to the Reason and
Nature of things, that no History of
any of these latter Times can parallel
it, and 'tis past the Power of Art, to
make any reasonable Defence for it.”</P>
<P>“Indeed some lame Reasons are gi∣ven
for, it by our Polititians. First,
they say the Prince with the great
Lip was extremely prest by the <HI>Gal∣lunarians</HI>
at Home in his own Coun∣try,
and not without apprehensions
<PB N="296" REF="302"/>
of seeing them e'er long, under the
Walls of his capital City.”</P>
<P>“From this circumstance of the Man
with the Lip, 'twas not irrational to
expect that he might be induc'd to make
a separate Peace with the <HI>Gallunarians,</HI>
and serve them as he did once the Prince
of <HI>Berlindia</HI> at the Treaty of Peace in a
former War, where he deserted him after
the solemnest Engagements never to
make Peace without him; but his
pressing Occasions requiring it, con∣cluded
a Peace without him, and left
him to come out of the War, as well
as he could, tho' he had come into it
only for his Assistance, Now find∣ing
him in danger of being ruin'd by
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Power, and judging
from former Practice in like Cases,
that he might be hurry'd into a Peace,
and leave them in the Lurch; they
have drawn him into this Labrinth, as
into a Step, which can never be re∣ceded
from without the utmost Affront
and Disgrace, either to the Family of
the <HI>Gallunarian,</HI> or of the Lip; an A∣ction
which in its own Nature, is a
Defiance of the whole <HI>Gallunarian</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
Power, and without any other Mani∣festo,
may be taken as a Declaration
from the House of the <HI>Lip,</HI> to the <HI>Gal∣lunarian,</HI>
that this War shall never
end, till one of those two Families are
ruin'd and reduc'd.”</P>
<P>“What Condition the Prince with
the Lip's Power is in, to make such a
huff at this Time, shall come under
Examination by and by; in the mean
time the <HI>Solunarians</HI> have clench'd the
Nail, and secur'd the War to last as
long as they think convenient.”</P>
<P>“If the Gallunarians should get the
better, and reduce the <HI>Man with the
Lip</HI> to Terms never so disadvantageons,
he cannot now make a Peace without
leave from the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the
<HI>Mogenites,</HI> least his Son should be ruin'd
also.—Or if he should make Articles
for himself, it must be with ten times
the Dishonour that he might have
done before.”</P>
<P>“Politicians say, 'tis never good for a
Prince to put himself into a case of
Desperation. This is drawing the
<PB N="298" REF="304"/>
Sword, and throwing away the Scab∣bard;
if a Disaster should befal him,
his Retreat is impossible, and this
must have been done only to secure
the <HI>Man with the Lip</HI> from being hufft,
or frighted into a separate Peace.”</P>
<P>“The second Reason People here give,
why the <HI>Solunarians</HI> are concerning
themselves in this Matter, is drawn
from Trade.”</P>
<P>“The continuing of <HI>Ebronia</HI> in the
Hands of the <HI>Gallunarians,</HI> will most
certainly be the Destruction of the
<HI>Solunarian</HI> and <HI>Mogenites</HI> Trade, both
to that Kingdom, and the whole Seas
on that side of the Moon; as this Ar∣ticle
includes a fifth Part of all the
Trade of the Moon, and would in
Conjunction with the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> at
last bring the Mastership of the Sea,
out of the Hands of the other, so it
would in effect be more detriment to
those two Nations, than ten Kingdoms
lost, if they had them to part with.”</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="305"/>
“This the <HI>Solunarians</HI> foreseeing, and
being extremely sensible of the entire
Ruin of their Trade, have left no
Stone unturn'd to bring this piece of
Pageantry on the Stage, by which they
have hook'd in the Old Black <HI>Eagle</HI> to
plunge himself over Head and Ears in
the Quarrel, in such a manner, as he
can never go back with any tolerable
Honour; he can never quit his Son and
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> without the
greatest Reproach and Disgrace of all
the World in the Moon.”</P>
<P>“Now whether one, or both of these
Reasons are true in this Case, as most
believe both of them to be true; the
Policy of my Country-men, the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
is visible indeed, but as for their
Honesty, it is past finding out.”</P>
<P>“But it is objected here, this Son <HI>of
the Lip</HI> has an undoubted Right to the
Crown of <HI>Ebronia.</HI> We do not Fight
now to set up an Usurper, but to pull
down an Usurper, and it has been made
plain by the Manifesto, that the giv∣ing
a Kingdom by Will, is no convey∣ance
of Right; the Prince of the <HI>Ea∣gle</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="306"/>
has an undoubted Right, and they
Fight to maintain it.”</P>
<P>“If this be true, then we must ask
these High and Mighty Gentlemen
how came they to recognize and ac∣knowledge
the present King on the
Throne? why did they own a Usurper
if he be such? either one or other must
be an act of Cowardize and Injustice,
and all the Politicks of the Moon can∣not
clear them of one of these two
Charges; either they were Cowardly
Knaves, before, or else they must be
Cunning Knaves now.”</P>
<P>“If the Young <HI>Eagle</HI> has an undoubted Title
now, so he had before, and they
Knew it as well before, as they do
now; what can they say for them∣selves,
why they should own a King,
they knew had no Title, or what can
they say for going to pull down one
that has a Title?”</P>
<P>“I must be allow'd to distinguish be∣tween
Fighting with a Nation, and
Fighting with the King. For Example.
Our Quarrel with the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> is
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
with the whole Nation, as they are
grown too strong for their Neighbours.
But our Quarrel with <HI>Ebronia</HI> is not with
the Nation, but with their King, and
this Quarrel seems to be unjust in this
particular, at least in them who own'd
him to be King, for that put an end
to the Controversy.”</P>
<P>“'Tis true, the Justice of publick A∣ctions,
either in Princes, or in States,
is no such nice Thing, that any Body
should be surpriz'd, to see the Govern∣ment
forfeit their Faith, and it seems
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> are no more careful
this way, than their Neighbours. But
then those People should in especial
manner forbear to reproach other Na∣tions
and Princes, with the breaches
which they themselves are subject
too”</P>
<P>“As to the <HI>Eagle,</HI> we have nothing to
say to the Honesty of his declaring his
Son King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> for as is hinted be∣fore,
he never acknowledg'd the Title of
the Usurper, but always declar'd, and
insisted on his own undoubted Right,
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
and that he would recover it if he
could.”</P>
<P>“Without doubt the <HI>Eagle</HI> has a Title
by Proximity of Blood, founded on the
renunciation of the King of <HI>Galluna∣ria</HI>
formerly mention'd, and if the
Will of the late King be Invalid, or
he had no Right to give the Soveraign∣ty
of his Kingdoms away, then the
<HI>Eagle</HI> is next Heir.”</P>
<P>But as we quit: his Morals, and ju∣stify
the Honesty of his Proceedings in
the War, against the present King of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> so in this Action of declaring
his second Son. We must begin to
question his Understanding, and sav∣ing
a respect of decency, it looks as if
his Musical Head was out of Tune,
to <HI>Illus tratellus.</HI> I crave leave to
tell you a Story out of your own
Country, which we have heard of hi∣ther.
A <HI>French</HI> Man that could speak
but broken <HI>England,</HI> was at the Court
of <HI>English,</HI> when on some occasion he
happen'd to hear the Title of the King of
<HI>England</HI> read thus, <HI>Charles the</HI> II. <HI>King
of England, Scotland, France and Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="309"/>
Vat is dat you say? says Monsieur, be∣ing
a little affronted, the Man reads
it again, as before. <HI>Charles she Second,
King of England, Scotland, France and
Ireland.—Charles the Second, King of
France! Ma Foy,</HI> says the French Man,
<HI>you can no read, Charles the Second, King
of France ha! ha! ha! Charles the Se∣cond,
King of France, when he can catch.</HI>
Any one may apply the Story, whether
it was a true one or no.”</P>
<P>“All the Lunar World looks on it,
therefore, as a most Ridiculous, Sense∣less
Thing, to make a Man a King of
a Country he has not one Foot
of Land in, nor can have a Foot there,
but what he must Fight for. As to the
probability of gaining it, I have no∣thing
to say to it, but if we may guess
at his Success there, by what has been
done in other Parts of the Moon, we
find he has Fought three Campaigns,
to lose every Foot he had got.”</P>
<P>“It had been much more to the Ho∣nour
of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Conduct, and of
the young Hero himself, first to ha'
let him ha' fac'd his Enemy in the Field,
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>
and as soon as he had beaten him, the
<HI>Ebronians</HI> would have acknowledg'd
him fast enough; or his own Victorious
Troops might have Proclaim'd him at
the Gate of their Capital City; and if
after all, the Success of the War had
deny'd him the Crown he had fought
for, he had the Honour to have shown
his Bravery, and he had been where he
was, a Prince of the Great Lip. A Son
of the <HI>Eagle</HI> is a Title much more Ho∣nourable
than a King without a Crown,
without Subjects, without a Kingdom,
and another Man upon his Throne;
but by this declaring him King, the
<HI>old Eagle</HI> has put him under a necessity
of gaining the Kingdom of <HI>Ebronia,</HI>
which at best is a great hazard, or if
he fails to be miserably despicable, and
to bear all his Life the constant Cha∣grin
of a great Title and no Posses∣sion.”</P>
<P>“How ridiculous will this poor Young
Gentleman look, if at last he should
be forc'd to come Home again with∣out
his Kingdom? what a King of
Clouts will he pass for, and what will
this <HI>King-making old Gentleman, his Fa∣ther
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
say,</HI> when the young Hero shall
tell him, your Majesty has made me a
Mock King for ail the World to laugh
at.”</P>
<P>“'Twas certainly the weakest Thing
that could be, for the <HI>Eagle</HI> thus to make
him a King of that, which, were the pro∣bability
greater than it is, he may easily,
without the help of a Miracle, be disap∣pointed
of.”</P>
<P>“'Tis true, the Confederates talk
big, and have lately had a great Victo∣ry,
and if Talk will beat the King
of <HI>Ebronia</HI> out of his Kingdom, he is
certainly undone, but we do not find
the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> part with any thing
they can keep, nor that they quit any
thing without Blows; It must cost a
great deal of Blood and Treasure be∣fore
this War can be ended; if absolute
Conquest on one side must be the Mat∣ter,
and if the Design on <HI>Ebronia</HI>
should miscarry, as one Voyage thither
has done already, where are we then?
Let any Man but look back, and con∣sider
what a sorry Figure your Confe∣derate
Fleet in your World had made,
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
after their <HI>Andalusian Expedition,</HI> if
they had not more by Fate than Con∣duct,
chopt upon a Booty at <HI>Vigo</HI> as
they came back.”</P>
<P>“In the like condition, will this new
King come back, if he should go for a
Kingdom and should not <HI>Catch,</HI> as the
<HI>French</HI> Man call'd it. 'Tis in the Sense
of the probability of this miscarriage,
that most Men wonder at these unac∣countable
Measures, and think the
<HI>Eagles</HI> Councils look a little Wildish,
as if some of his great Men were grown
Dilirious and Whymsical, that fancy'd
Crowns and Kingdoms were to come
and go, just as the great Divan at their
Court should direct. This confusion
of Circumstances has occasion'd a cer∣tain
Copy of Verses to appear about
the Moon, which in our Characters
may be read as follws.”</P>

He's hardly fit to fill th' <HI>Eagle's</HI> Throne,
Who gives new Crowns, and can't protect his

<P>“But after all to come closer to the Point,
if I can now make it out that whate∣ver
it was before, this very Practice of
declaring a second Son to be King of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> has publickly own'd the <HI>Pro∣ceedings</HI>
of the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> to
be Just, and the Title of his Grandson
to be much better than the Title of the
now declar'd King, what shall we call
it then?”</P>
<P>“In order to this, 'tis first necessary to
examine the Title of the present King,
and to enter into the History of his
coming to the Crown, in which I shall
be very Brief.”</P>
<P>“The last King of <HI>Ebronia</HI> dying with∣out
issue, and a former Renunciation
taking Place, the Succession de∣volves
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
on the House of the <HI>Eagle</HI> as be
fore, of whom the present <HI>Eagle</HI> is the
eldest Branch.”</P>
<P>“But the late King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> to pre∣vent
the Succession of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Line▪
makes a Will, and supplies the Proviso
of Renunciation by Devising, Giving, or
Bequeathing the Crown to the Grand∣son
of his Sister.”</P>
<P>“The King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> insists that
this is a lawful Title to the Crown,
and seizes it accordingly, instating his
Grandson in the Possession.”</P>
<P>“The <HI>Eagle</HI> alledges the Renunciati∣on
to confirm his Title as Heir; and
as to the Will of the late King, he
says Crowns cannot descend by Gift
and tho' the late King had an undoubt∣ed
Right to enjoy it himself, he had
none to give it away.”</P>
<P>“To make the application of this Hi∣story
as short as may be, I demand
then what Right has the <HI>Eagle</HI> to give
it to his second Son? If Crowns are
not to descend by Gift, he may have a
<PB N="309" REF="315"/>
Right to enjoy it, but can have none
to give it away, but if he has a Right
to give it away; so had the former
King, and then the present King has a
better Title to it than the new one,
because his Gift was Prior to this of
the <HI>Eagle.</HI>”</P>
<P>“I would be glad to see this answer'd;
and if it can't, then I Query whether
the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Senses ought not to be que∣stion'd,
for setting up a Title on the
very Foundation for which he quarrels
at him that is in Possession, and so con∣firm
the honesty of the Possessor's Ti∣tle
by his own Practice.?”</P>
<P>“From the whole, I make no Scruple
to say that either the <HI>Eagle's</HI> second
Son has no Title to the Kingdom of <HI>E∣bronia,</HI>
or else giving of Crowns is a
legal Practice; and if Crowns may des∣cend
by Gift, then has the other King
a better Title than he, because it was
given him first, and the <HI>Eagle</HI> has on∣ly
given away what he had no Right
to, because 'twas given away before
he had any Title to it himself.”</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="316"/>
“Further, the Posterity of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s
eldest Son are manifestly injur'd in this
Action, for Kings can no more give a∣way
their Crowns from their Posterity,
than from themselves; if the Right be
in the <HI>Eagle,</HI> 'tis his, as he's the eldest
Male Branch of the House of <HI>the great
Lip,</HI> not as he is <HI>Eagle,</HI> and from him
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> by the same
Right of Devolution descends to his
Posterity, and rests on the Male Line
of every eldest Branch. If so, no Act
of Renunciation can alter this Succes∣sion,
for that is a Gift, and the Gift is
exploded, or else the whole House of
<HI>the great Lip</HI> is excluded; so that let
the Argument be turn'd and twisted
never so many ways, it all Centers in
this, that the present Person can have
no Title to the Crown of <HI>Ebronia.</HI>”</P>
<P>“If he has any Title, 'tis from the
Gift of his Father and elder Brother;
if the Gift of a Crown is no good Title,
then his Title cannot be good; If the
Gift of a Crown is a good Title, then the
Crown was given away before, and so
neither he nor his Father has any Ti∣tle.”</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="317"/>
“Let him that can answer these Pa∣radoxes
defend his Title if he can; and
what shall we now say to the War in
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> only this, that they are going
to fight for the Crown of <HI>Ebronia?</HI> and
to take it away from one that has no
Right to it, to give it to one that
has a less Right than he, and 'tis to be
fear'd that if Heaven be Righteous,
'twill succeed accordingly.”</P>
<P>“The Gentlemen of Letters who have
wrote of this in our Lunar World, on
the Subject of the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> Title,
have took a great deal of Liberty in
the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s behalf, to Banter and Ri∣dicule
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> sham of a Title,
as if it were a pretence too weak for a∣ny
Prince to make use of, to talk of
Kings giving their Crowns by Will.”</P>
<P>“Kingdoms and Governments, says a
Learned Lunar Author, are not things of such
indifferent Value to be given away, like a
Token left for a Legacy. If any Prince has
ever given or transferr'd his Government,
it has been done by solemn Act, and the Peo∣ple
have been call'd to assent and confirm such
Concessions.”</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="318"/>
“Then the same Author goes on, to
Treat the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> with a
great deal of Severity, and exposes his
Politicks, that he should think to put
upon the Moon with so empty, so weak,
so ridiculous a Pretence, as the Will of
a weak Headed Prince, who neither
had a Right to give his Crown, nor a
Brain to know what he was doing,
and he laughs to think what the
King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> would have said
to have such a dull Trick as that, put
upon him in any such Case.”</P>
<P>“Now when we have been so Witty
upon this very Article, of giving a way
the Crown to the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI>'s
Grandson, as an incongruous and ri∣diculous
Thing, shall we come to make
the same Incongruity be the Founda∣tion
of a War?”</P>
<P>“With what Justice can we make a
War for a Prince who has only a good
Title, by Vertue of the self same Acti∣on
which makes the Grandson of his
Enemy have a bad Title.”</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319"/>
“I always thought we had a
Just Ground to make War on <HI>Ebronia,</HI>
as we were bound say former Alliances
to assist the <HI>Eagle</HI> in the recovery of
it in case of the death of the late King
of that Country.”</P>
<P>“But now the <HI>Eagle</HI> has refus'd the
Succession, and his Eldest Son has re∣fus'd
it, I would be glad to see it
prov'd how the second Son can have a
Title, and yet the other King have no
Title.”</P>
<P>“What a strange sort of a Thing is
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> that two of the
greatest Princes of the Lunar World
should Fight, not who shall have it,
for neither of them will accept of it,
but who shall have the Power of giving
it away.”</P>
<P>“Here are four Princes refuse it; the
King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI>'s Sons had a Title
in Right of their Mother, and 'twas
not the former Renunciations that
would have barr'd them, if this softer
way had not been found out; for
time was it has been pleaded on behalf
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
of the eldest Son of the <HI>Gallunarian</HI>
King, that his Mother could not give
away his Right before he was born.”</P>
<P>“Then the <HI>Eagle</HI> has a Right, and
under him his eldest Son; and none of
all these four will accept of the Crown;
I believe all the Moon can't find four
more that would refuse it.”</P>
<P>“Now, tho' none of these think it
worth accepting themselves, yet they
fall out about the Right of giving it
away. The King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> will
not accept of it himself, but he gets a
Gift from the last Incumbent. This,
says the <HI>Eagle,</HI> can't be a good Title,
for the late King had no Right to make
a Deed of Gift of the Crown, since a
King is only Tennant for Life, and
Succession of Crowns either must de∣scend
by a Lineal Progression in the
Right of Primogeniture, or else they
lose the Tenure, and devolve on the
People.”</P>
<P>“Now as this Argument holds good
the <HI>Eagle</HI> has an undoubted Title to
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia:</HI> But then, says
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
his <HI>Eaglish Majesty,</HI> I cannot accept of the
Crown my self for I am the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and
my eldest Son has two Kingdoms al∣ready,
and is in a fair way to be <HI>Eagle</HI>
after me, and 'tis not worth while for
him, but I have a second Son, and we
will give it him.”</P>
<P>“Now may the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> say,
if one Gift is good, another is good, and
ours is the first Gift, and therefore we
will keep it; and tho' I solemnly de∣clare
I should be very sorry to see the
Crown of <HI>Ebronia</HI> rest in the House of
the <HI>Gallunarian,</HI> because our Trade
will suffer exceedingly; yet if never so
much damage were to come of it, we
ought to do Justice in the World; if
neither the <HI>Eagle</HI> nor his eldest Son will
be King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> but a Deed of Gift
shall be made, the first Gift has the
Right, for nothing can be given away
to two People at once, and 'tis appa∣rent
that the late King had as much
Right to give it away as any Body.”</P>
<P>“The poor <HI>Ebronians</HI> are in a fine Con∣dition
all this while, that no Body con∣cerns
them in the Matter; neither
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>
Party has so much as thought it worth
while to ask them who they would
have to Reign over them, here has
been no Assembly, <HI>no Cortez,</HI> no Meet∣ing
of the People of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> neither
Collectively or Representatively, no
general Convention of the Nobility,
no House of Feathers, but <HI>Ebronia</HI> lies
as the spoil of the Victor wholly passive,
and her People and Princes, as if they
were wholly unconcern'd, lie by and
look on, whoever is like to be King,
they are like to suffer deeply by the
Strife, and yet neither side has thought
fit to consult them about it.”</P>
<P>“The conclusion of the whole Mat∣ter
is in short this, here is certainly a
a false Step taken, how it shall be recti∣fy'd
is not the present Business, nor am I
Wise enough to Prescribe. One Man
may do in a Moment what all the Lu∣nar
World cannot undo in an Age.
'Tis not be thought the <HI>Eagle</HI> will be
prevail'd on to undo it, nay he has
Sworn not to alter it.”</P>
<P>“I am not concern'd to prove the Ti∣tle
of the present King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> no,
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
nor of the <HI>Eagles</HI> neither; but I think
I can never be answer'd in this, that
this Gift of the <HI>Eagles</HI> to his second
Son is preposterous, inconsistent with
all his Claim to the Crown, and the
greatest confirmation of the Title of
his Enemy that it was possible to give,
and no doubt the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> will lay
hold of the Argument.”</P>
<P>“If this Prince was the <HI>Eagle's</HI> eldest
Son, he might have a Just Right from
the concession of his Father, because
the Right being inherent, he only re∣ceiv'd
from him an Investiture of Time,
but as this young Gentleman is a se∣cond
Son he has no more Right, his
elder Brother being alive, than your
<HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> or <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> in
your World.”</P>
<P>“Let them Fight then for such a Cause,
who valuing only the Pay, make War
a Trade, and Fight for any thing they
are bid to Fight for, and as such value
not the Justice of the War, nor trou∣ble
their Heads about Causes and Con∣sequences,
so they have their Pay, 'tis
well enough for them.”</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="324"/>
“But were the Justice of the War ex∣amin'd,
I can see none, this Declar∣ing

Nor was he a false Prophet, for as this

ha' been drown'd by a very violent Tem∣pest,
things not very usual in those Coun∣tries;

so much as to be able to set his Foot up∣on
his new Kingdom of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> but his
Adversary by wonderful Dexterity, and
the Assistance of his old Grandfather
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch, beat his Troops

a quiet Possession of all the vast <HI>Ebronian

Diversion of the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Fleet, a
Shock was given them on another Side,
which if it had not happen'd, it was
thought the new King had been sent
home apain <HI>Re Infecta.</HI></P>
<P>Being very much Shockt in my Judg∣ment
of this Affair, by these unanswer∣able
Reasons; I enquir'd of my Author
who were the Directors of this Matter?
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
he told me plainly it was done by those
great States Men, which the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Queen had lately very Justly turn'd out,
whose Politicks were very unaccounta∣ble
in a great many other things, as well
as in that.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the War was carry'd on un∣der,
the new Ministry, and no War in
the World can be Juster, on account of
the Injustice and Encroachment of the
<HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch.</P>
<P>The Queen therefore and her present
Ministers, go on with the War on Prin∣ciples
of Confederacy; 'tis the business
of the <HI>Solunarians</HI> to beat the Invader
out, and then let the People come and
make a fair Decision who they will have
to Reign over them.</P>
<P>This indeed justifies the War in <HI>Ebro∣nia,</HI>
to be Right, but for the Personal
Proceedure as before, 'tis all Contradi∣ction
and can never be answer'd.</P>
<P>I hope no Man will be so malicious, as
to say I am hereby reflecting on our War
with <HI>Spain.</HI> I am very forward to say,
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
it is a most Just and Reasonable War, as
to paralels between the Case of the Prin∣ces,
in defending the Matter of Person∣al
Right, <HI>Hic labor, Hoc opus.</HI></P>
<P>Thus however you see <HI>Humanum est
Errare,</HI> whether in this World or in the
Moon, 'tis all one, Infallibility of Coun∣cels
any more than of Doctrine, is not
in Man.</P>
<P>The Reader may observe, I have for∣merly
noted there was a new Consolida∣tor
to be Built, and observ'd what strug∣gle
there was in the Moon about choos∣ing
the Feathers.</P>
<P>I cannot omit some further Remarks here, as
1. It is to be observ'd, that this last
Consolidator was in a manner quite
worn out.—It had indeed continu'd
but 3 Year, which was the stated Time
by Law, but it had been so <HI>Hurry'd,</HI> so
<HI>Party Rid,</HI> so often had been up in <HI>the
Moon,</HI> and made <HI>so many</HI> such <HI>extrava∣gant
Flights,</HI> and unnecessary <HI>Voyages thi∣ther,</HI>
that it began to be exceedingly
<HI>worn</HI> and defective.
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
2. This occasion'd that the light flut∣tering
Feathers, and the fermented Fea∣thers
<HI>made strange Work of it;</HI> nay, some∣times
they were so hot, they were like
to ha' ruin'd the whole Fabrick, and had
it not been for the <HI>great Feather</HI> in the
Center, a and a few <HI>Negative</HI> Feathers
who were Wiser than the rest, all the
<HI>Machines,</HI> had been broke to pieces, and
the whole Nation put into a most strange
Confusion.</P>
<P>Sometimes their Motion was <HI>so vio∣lent
and precipitant,</HI> that there was great
apprehensions of its being <HI>set on fire by
its own Velocity,</HI> for swiftness of Motion
is allow'd by the Sages and <HI>so so's</HI> to pro∣duce
<HI>Fire,</HI> as in <HI>Wheels, Mills</HI> and seve∣ral
sorts of <HI>Mechanick Engines</HI> which are
frequently Fir'd, and so in <HI>Thoughts,
Brains, Assemblies, Consolidators,</HI> and all
such combustible Things.</P>
<P>Indeed these things were of greats Con∣sequence,
and therefore require some
more nice Examination than ordinary,
and the following Story will in part ex∣plain
it.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="329"/>
Among the rest of the Broils they had
with the <HI>Grandees,</HI> one happen'd on this
occasion.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Tacking Feathure</HI> being ac∣cidentally
met by a Grandee's Footman,
whom it seems wanted some Manners,
the Slave began to haloo him in the
Street, with a Tacker, a Tacker, a <HI>Fea∣thwr</HI>-Fool,
a Tacker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so brought
the Mob about him, and had not the
<HI>Grandee</HI> himself come in the very inte∣rim,
and rescu'd the <HI>Feather,</HI> the Mob
had demolisht him, they were so en∣rag'd.</P>
<P>As this Gentleman<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>Feather</HI> was rescud'd
with great Courtesie by the <HI>Grandee,</HI> ta∣ken
into his Coach and carry'd home to
his House, he desir'd to speak with the
Footman.</P>
<P>The Fellow being call'd in, was ask't
by him who employ'd him, or set him
on to offer him this Insult? The Footman
being a ready bold Fellow, told him no
Body Sir, but you are all grown so ri∣diculous
to the whole Nation, that if
the 134 of you were lest but to us Foot∣men,
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
and it was not in more respect to
our Masters, than you, we should Cure
you of ever coming into the <HI>Consolidator</HI>
again, and all the People in the Moon
are of our Mind.</P>
<P>But says the <HI>Feather,</HI> why do you call
me Fool too? why Sir, says he, because
no Body could ever tell us what it was
you drove at, and we ha' been told you
never knew your selves; now if one of
you Tacking <HI>Feathers</HI> would but tell the
World what your real Design was, they
would be satisfy'd, but to be leaders
in the <HI>Consolidator,</HI> and to Act without
Meaning, without Thought or Design,
must argue your' Fools, or worse,
and you will find all the Moon of my
Mind.</P>
<P>But what if we had a meaning, says
the <HI>Feather</HI>-Man? why then, says the
Footman, we shall leave calling you Fools,
and call you Knaves, for it could never
bean Honest one, so that you had bet∣ter
stand as you do: and I make it out
thus.</P>
<P>You knew, that upon your Tacking
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
the <HI>Crolians</HI> to the Tribute Bill, the <HI>Gran∣dees</HI>
must reject both, they having de∣clar'd
against reading any Bills Tackt to∣gether,
as being against their Priviledges.
Now if you had any Design, it must be to
have the Bill of Tribute lost, and that
must be to disappoint all the publick Af∣fairs,
expose the Queen, break all Mea∣sures,
discourage the Confederates, and
putting all things backward, bring the
<HI>Gallunarian</HI> Forces upon them, and put all
<HI>Solunaria</HI> into Confusion. Now Sir, says
he, we cannot have such course Thoughts
of you, as to believe you could design
such dark, mischievous things as these,
and therefore we chose to believe you all
Fools, and not fit to be put into a <HI>Conso∣lidator</HI>
again; than Knaves and Traytors
to your Country, and consequently fit
for a worse Place.</P>
<P>The plainness of the Footman was such,
and so unanswerable, that his Master was
fain to check him, and so the Discourse
broke off, and we shall leave it there, and
proceed to the Story.</P>
<P>The Men of the Feather as I have
noted, who are represented here by the
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
<HI>Consolidator,</HI> fell all together by the Ears,
and <HI>all the Moon</HI> was in a combustion.
The Case was as follows.</P>
<P>They had three times lost <HI>their qual∣lifying
Law,</HI> and particularly they ob∣serv'd
the <HI>Grandees</HI> were the Men that
threw it out, and notwithstanding <HI>the
Plot of the Tackers,</HI> as they call'd them,
who were <HI>as I noted,</HI> observ'd to be in
Conjunction <HI>with the Crolians,</HI> yet the
Law always past <HI>the Feathers,</HI> but still
The <HI>Grandees</HI> quasht it.</P>
<P>To show their Resentment <HI>at the
Grandees,</HI> they had often made <HI>attempts
To mortify them,</HI> sometimes Arraigning
them in general, sometimes <HI>Impeaching
Private Members</HI> of their House, but still
All wou'd not do, <HI>the Grandees</HI> had the
better of them, and going on with Regu∣larity
and Temper, the <HI>Consolidators</HI> or
Feather-Men always had the worst, <HI>the
Grandees had the applause of all the Moon</HI>
had <HI>the last Blow</HI> on every Occasion, and
the other sunk in their Reputation ex∣ceedingly.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="333"/>
It is necessary to understand here,
that the Men of the Feather serve in se∣veral
Capacities, and under several De∣nominations,
and <HI>act by themselves,</HI> sing∣ly
consider'd, they are call'd <HI>the Conso∣lidator,</HI>
and the Feathers we mention'd
abstracted from their Persons, make the
glorious Engine we speak of, and in
which, when any suddain Motion takes
them, they can all shut themselves up,
and away for the Moon.</P>
<P>But when these are <HI>joyn'd with the
Grandees, and the Queen,</HI> so United, they
make a great <HI>Cortez,</HI> or general Colle∣ction
of all the Governing Authority of
the Nation.</P>
<P>When this last Fraction happen'd, the
<HI>Men of the Feather</HI> were under an exceed∣ing
Ferment, they had in some Passion
taken into their Custody, some good
Honest <HI>Lunar Country-Men,</HI> for an Of∣fence,
which indeed few but themselves
ever immagin'd was a Crime, for the
poor Men did nothing but pursue their
own Right by the Law.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="334"/>
'Tis thought the Men of the Feather
soon saw they were in the Wrong, but
acted like some Men in our World, that
when they make a mistake, being too
Proud to own themselves in the wrong,
run themselves into worse Errors to
mend it.</P>
<P>So <HI>these Lunar Gentlemen</HI> distaining
to have it said they <HI>could be mistaken,</HI>
committed two Errors to conceal one,
'till at last they came to be laught at by
<HI>all the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>These poor Men having lain long
while in Prison, for little or no Crime, at
last were advis'd to apply themselves <HI>to
the Law for Discharge;</HI> the Law would fairly
have Discharg'd them; for <HI>in that Coun∣try,</HI>
no Man may be Imprison'd, but he
must in a certain Time be Tryed, or let
go upon Pledges of his Friends, <HI>much
like our giving Bail on a Writ of Habe as Cor∣pus;</HI>
but the Judges, whether over-aw'd
by the Feathers, or what was the Cause,
Authors have not determin'd, did not
care to venture Discharging them.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="335"/>
The poor Men thus remanded, ap∣ply'd
themselves <HI>to the Grandees</HI> who
were then Sitting, and who are <HI>the Soveraign
Judicature</HI> of the Country, and
before whom Appeals lie from all Courts
of Justice. <HI>The Grandees</HI> as in Duty
bound, appear'd ready to do them Ju∣stice,
but the Queen was to be apply'd
to, first to grant a Writ, or a Warrant
for a Writ, call'd in their Country <HI>a Writ
of Follies,</HI> which is as much as to say
Mistakes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Consolidators</HI> foreseeing the Conse∣quence,
immediately apply'd themselves
to the Queen with an Address, the Terms
of which were so <HI>Ʋndu—l and Ʋnman-ly,</HI>
that had she not been a Queen of un∣usual
Candor and Goodness, she would
have Treated them as they deserv'd, for
they upbraided her with their Freedom
and Readiness in granting her Supplies,
and therefore as good as told her they
expected she should do as they desir'd.</P>
<P>These People that knew the Supplies
given, were from <HI>necessity, Legal,</HI> and for
their <HI>own Defence,</HI> while the granting
their Request, must have been <HI>Illegal,
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
Arbitrary, <HI>a</HI> Dispensing</HI> with the Laws,
and <HI>denying Justice</HI> to her Subjects, <HI>the
very thing they ruin'd her Father for,</HI> were
justly provok'd to see their good Queen
so barbarously Treated.</P>
<P>The Queen full of Goodness and
Calmness, gave them a gentle kind An∣swer,
but told them she must be careful
to Act with due Regard to the Laws,
and could not interrupt the course of
Judicial Proceedings; and at the same
time granted the Writ, having first con∣sulted
with her Council, and receiv'd
the Opinion of all the Judges, that it
was not only Safe, but Just and Reason∣able,
and a Right to her People which
she could not deny.</P>
<P>This Proceeding gall'd the Feathers to
the quick, and finding the <HI>Grandees</HI> re∣solv'd
to proceed Judicially upon the
said <HI>Writ of Follies,</HI> which if they did,
the Prisoners would be deliver'd and the
Follies fixt upon the Feathers, they
sent their Poursuivants took them
out of the Common Prison, and con∣vey'd
them separately and privately in∣to
Prisons of their own.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="337"/>
This rash and unprecedented Proceed∣ings,
pusht them farther into a Labrinth,
from whence it was impossible they
could ever find their way out, but with
infinite Loss to their Reputation, like a
Sheep in a thick Wood, that at every
Briar pulls some of the Wool from her
Back, till she comes out in a most scan∣dalous
Pickle of Nakedness and Scratch∣es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grandees</HI> immediately publisht
six Articles in Vindication of the Peo∣ples
Right, against the assum'd Privi∣ledges
of the <HI>Feathers,</HI> the Abstract of
which is as follows.</P>
<P>1. That the <HI>Feathers</HI> had no Right to
Claim, or make any new Priviledges for
themselves, other than they had before.</P>
<P>2. That every Freeman of the Moon
had a Right to repel Injury with Law.</P>
<P>3. That Imprisoning the 5 Country∣men
by the <HI>Feathers,</HI> was assuming a
new Priviledge they had no Right to, and
a subjecting the Subjects Right to their
Arbitrary Votes.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="338"/>
4. That a <HI>Writ of Deliverance,</HI> or re∣moving
the Body, is the legal Right of
every Subject in the Moon, in order to
his Liberty, in case of Imprisonment.</P>
<P>5. That to punish any Person for as∣sisting
the Subject, in procuring or pro∣secuting
the said <HI>Writ of Deliverance,</HI> is
a breach of the Laws, and a thing of
dangerous Consequence.</P>
<P>6. That a <HI>Writ of Follies</HI> is not a Grace,
but a Right, and ought not to be deny'd
to the Subject.</P>
<P>These Resolves struck the languish∣ing
Reputation of the <HI>Feathers</HI> with
the dead Palsie, and they began to stink
in the Nostrils of all the Nations in the
Moon.</P>
<P>But besides this, they had one strange
effect, which was a prodigious disap∣pointment
to the Men of the <HI>Feather.</HI></P>
<P>I had observ'd before, that there was
to be a new Set of <HI>Feathers,</HI> provided
in order to Building another <HI>Consolida∣tor,</HI>
according to a late Law for a new
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
Engine every three Years. Now seve∣ral
of these Men of the <HI>Feather,</HI> who
thought their <HI>Feathers</HI> capable of serv∣ing
again, had made great Interest, and
been at great Cost to have their old
<HI>Feathers</HI> chosen again, but the People
had entertain'd such scoundrel Opinions
of these Proceedings, such as Tacking,
<HI>Consolidating,</HI> Imprisoning Electors, Im∣peaching
without Tryal, <HI>Writs of
Follies</HI> and the like, that if anyone was
known to be concern'd in any of these things,
no Body would Vote for him.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen were so mortify'd at
this, that even the hottest High-Church
<HI>Solunarian</HI> of them all, if he put in any
where to be re-chosen, the first thing he
had to do, was to assure the People he
was no Tacker, none of the 134, and a
vast deal of difficulty they had to Purge
themselves of this blessed Action, which
they us'd to value themselves on before,
as their Glory and Merit.</P>
<P>Thus they grew asham'd of it as a
Crime, got Men to go about to vouch
for them to the Country People, that
they were no Tackers, nay, one of them
to clear himself loudly forswore it, and
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
taking a Glass of Wine wisht it might
never pass thro' him, if he was a Tack∣er,
tho' all Men suspected him to be of
that Number too, he having been one of
the forwardest that way on all Occasi∣ons,
of any Person among the <HI>South
Folk of the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, one of the <HI>Feathers</HI>
for the <HI>middle Province</HI> of the Country,
who us'd to think it his Honour to be
for the qualifying Law, seeing which
way the humour of the Country ran,
took as much Pains now to tell the Peo∣ple
he was no Tacker, as he did before,
to promise them that he would do his
utmost to have the <HI>Crolians</HI> reduc'd, and
that Bill to pass, the Reason of which
was plain, that he saw if it should be
known he was a Tacker, he should
never have his <HI>Feather</HI> return'd to be
put into the <HI>Consolidator.</HI></P>
<P>The Heats and Feuds that the <HI>Fea∣thers</HI>
and the <HI>Grandees</HI> were now run in∣to,
began to make the latter very un∣easie,
and they sent to the <HI>Grandees</HI> to
hasten them, and put them in mind of
passing some Laws they had sent up to
them for raising Mony, and which lay be∣fore
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
them, knowing that as soon as those
Laws were past, the Queen would break
'em up, and they being very willing to
be gone, before these things came too
far upon the Stage, urg'd them to dis∣patch.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Grandees</HI> resolving to go
thoro' with the Matter, sent to them to
come to a Treaty on the foot of the six
Articles, and to bring any Reasons they
could, to prove the Power they had to
Act as they had done with the Country∣men,
and with the Lawyers they had
put in Prison for assisting them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Feathers</HI> were very backward
and stiff about this Conference, or Trea∣ty,
'till at last the <HI>Grandees</HI> having suf∣ficiently
expos'd them to all the Nation,
the Bills were past, the <HI>Grandees</HI> caus'd
the particulars to be Printed, and a Re∣presentation
of their Proceedings, and
the <HI>Feathers</HI> foul Dealings to the Queen
of the Country, and so her Majesty sent
them Home.</P>
<P>But if they were asham'd of being call'd
Tackers before, they were doubly morti∣fy'd
at this now, nay the Country resent∣ed
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
it so exceedingly, that some of them
began to consider whether they should
venture to go Home or no; Printed Lists
of their Names were Publish'd, tho' we
do not say they were true Lists, for it
was a hard thing to know which were
true Lists, and which were not, nor in∣deed
could a true List be made, no Man
being able to retain the exact Account of
who were the Men in his Memory.</P>
<P>For as there were 134 Tackers, so
there were 141 of these, who by a Name
of Distinction, were call'd <HI>Lebusyraneim,</HI>
in <HI>English Ailesbury-men.</HI></P>
<P>The People were so exasperated a∣gainst
these, that they express'd their
Resentment upon all Occasions, and least
the Queen should think that the Nation
approv'd the Proceedings, they drew
up a Representation or Complaint, full of
most dutiful Expressions to their Queen,
and full of Resentment against the <HI>Fea∣thers,</HI>
the Copy of which being hand∣ed
about the Moon the last time I was
there, I shall take the Pains to put it
into <HI>English</HI> in the best manner I can,
keeping as near the Originial as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="343"/>
If any Man shall now wickedly sug∣gest,
that this Relation has any
retrospect to the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> the
Author declares them malitious Mis∣construers
of his honest Relation of Mat∣ters
from this remote Country, and of∣fers
his positive Oath for their Satisfa∣ction,
that the very last Journy he made
into those Lunar Regions, this Matter
was upon the Stage, of which, if this
Treatise was not so near its conclu∣sion,
the Reader might expect a more
particular Account.</P>
<P>If there is any Analogy or Similitude
between the Transactions of either
World, he cannot account for that,
'tis application makes the Ass.</P>
<P>And yet sometimes he has thought,
as some People Fable of the Platonick
Year, that after such a certain Revolu∣tion
of Time, all Things are Transact∣ed
over again, and the same People live
again, are the same Fools, Knaves, Philo∣sophers
and Mad-men they were before,
tho' without any Knowledge of, or Re∣trospect
to what they acted before; so
why should it be impossible, that as the
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
Moon and this World are noted before
to be Twins and Sisters, equal in Mo∣tion
and in Influence, and perhaps in
Qualities, the same secret Power should
so act them, as that <HI>like</HI> Actions and
Circumstances should happen in all
Parts of both Worlds at the same time.</P>
<P>I leave this Thought to the improve∣ment
of our Royal Learned Societies of the
<HI>Anticacofanums, Opposotians, Periodicari∣ans,
Antepredestinarians,</HI> Universal <HI>Sou∣lians</HI>
and such like unfathomable Peo∣ple,
who, without question, upon ma∣ture
Enquiry will find out the Truth
of this Matter.</P>
<P>But if any one shall scruple the Mat∣ter
of Fact as I have here related it, I
freely give him leave to do as I did, and
go up to the Moon for a Demonstration;
and if upon his return he does not give
ample Testimony to the Case in every
part of it, as here related, I am content
to pass for the Contriver of it my self,
and be punish'd as the Law shall say I
deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="345"/>
Nor was this all, the publick Matters
in which this Nation of <HI>Solunarians</HI> took
wrong Measures, far about this time,
the Misunderstandings between the
Southern and Northern Men began again,
and the <HI>Solunarians</HI> made several Laws,
as they call'd them, to secure themselves
against the Dangers they pretended
might accrue from the new Measures
the <HI>Nolunarians</HI> had taken; but so un∣happily
were they blinded by the
mong themselves, and by set by Opini∣on
and Interest, that every Law they
made, or so much as attempted to make,
was really to the Advantage, and to the
Interest of the Northern-Men, and to
their own loss; so Ignorantly and
Weak-headed was these <HI>High Solunarian</HI>
Church-Men in the true Interest of their
Country, led by their implacable Malice
at <HI>Crolianism,</HI> which as is before noted,
was the Establisht Religion of that
Country.</P>
<P>But as this Matter was but Transact∣ing
when I took the other Remarks, and
that I did not obtain a full Understand∣ing
of it, 'till my second Voyage, I re∣fer
it to a more full Relation of my far∣ther
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
Travels that way, when I shall
not fail to give a clear State of the De∣bate
of the two Kingdoms, in which
the Southern Men had the least Reason,
and the worst Success that ever they
had in any Affair of that Nature for ma∣ny
Years before.</P>
<P>It was always my Opinion in Affairs
<HI>on this side the Moon,</HI> that tho' sometimes
a foolish Bolt may hit the Point, and a
random Shot kill the Enemy, yet that
generally Discretion and Prudence of
Mannagement, had the Advantage, and
met with a proportion'd Success, and
things were, or were not happy, in their
Conclusion as they were, more or less
wisely Contriv'd and Directed.</P>
<P>And tho' it may not be allow'd to be
so here, yet I found it more constantly
so there, Effects were true to their Causes,
and confusion of Councils never fail'd <HI>in
the Moon</HI> to be follow'd by distracted
and destructive Consequences.</P>
<P>This appear'd more eminently in
the Dispute between these two Lunar
Nations we are speaking of; never were
<PB N="341" REF="347"/>
People in the Moon, <HI>whatever they might
be in other Places,</HI> so divided in their O∣pinions
about a matter of such Conse∣quence.
Some were for declaring War
immediately upon the Northern Men,
tho' they cou'd show no Reason at all
why, only because they would not do
as they would have 'em; <HI>a parcel of poor
Scoundrel, Scabby Rogues,</HI> they ought to
be made submit, <HI>what!</HI> won't they de∣clare
the same King as we do! <HI>hang
them Rogues!</HI> a pack of Crolian Prestarian
Devils, <HI>we must make them do it,</HI> down
with them the shortest Way, declare War
immediately, and <HI>down with them.</HI>—
Nay some were for falling on them di∣rectly,
without the formality of declar∣ing
War.</P>
<P>Others, more afraid than hurt, cry'd
out Invasions, Depredation, Fire and
Sword, the Northern Men would be
upon them immediately, and propos'd
to Fortify their Frontiers, and file off
their Forces to the Borders; nay, so ap∣prehensive
did those Men of Prudence
pretend to be, that they order'd Towns
to be Fortify'd 100 <HI>Mile off of the Place,</HI>
when all this while the poor Northern
<PB N="342" REF="348"/>
Men did nothing but tell them, that un∣less
they would come to Terms, they
would not have, the same King as they,
and then took some Measures to let them
see they did not purpose to be forc'd to
it.</P>
<P>Another sort of Wiser Men than these,
propos'd to Unite with them, hear their
Reasons, and do them Right. These
indeed were, the only Men that were
in the right Method of concluding this
unhappy Broil, and for that Reason,
were the most unlikely to succeed.</P>
<P>But the Wildest Notion of all, was,
when some of the <HI>Grandees</HI> made a grave
Address to the Queen of the Country, to
desire the Northern Men to settle Mat∣ters
first, and to tell them, that when
that was done, <HI>they should see what these
would do for them.</HI> This was a home
Stroke, if it had but hit, and the Mis∣fortune
only lay in this, <HI>That the Nor∣thern
Men were<SEG REND="decorInit">n</SEG>ot Fools enough;</HI> the
clearness of the Air in those cold Cli∣mates
generally clearing the Head so
early, that those People see much far∣ther
into a Mill-stone, than <HI>any Blind
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>
Man in all the Southern Nations of the
Moon.</HI></P>
<P>There was an another unhappiness in
this Case, which made the Matter yet
more confus'd, and that was, that the
Souldiers had generally no gust to this
War.—This was an odd Case; for those
sort of Gentlemen, especially <HI>in the
World in the Moon,</HI> don't use to enquire
into the Justice of the Case they Fight
for, but they reckon 'tis their Business
to go where they are sent, and kill any
Body they are order'd to kill, leaving
their Governors to answer for the Ju∣stice
of it; but there was another Reason
to be given why <HI>the Men of the Sword</HI>
were so averse, and always talk't cold∣ly
of the fighting Part, and tho' the
Northern Men call'd it fear, yet I can∣not
joyn with them in that, for <HI>to fear</HI>
requires Thinking; and some of our <HI>So∣lunarians</HI>
are absolutely protected from
the first, because they never meddle
with the last, <HI>except when they come to the
Engine,</HI> and therefore 'tis plain it could
not proceed from Fear.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="350"/>
It has puzzl'd' the most discerning
Heads of the Age, to give a Reason
from whence this Aversion proceeded,
and various Judgments have been gi∣ven
of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nolunarians</HI> jested with them, and
when they talk't of Fighting, bad them
look back into History, and examine
what they ever made of a <HI>Nolunarian
War,</HI> and whether they had not been
often well beaten and sent short home,
bid them have a care of <HI>catching a Tar∣tar,</HI>
as we call it, and always made
themselves merry with it.</P>
<P>They banter'd the <HI>Solunarians</HI> too, a∣bout
the Fears an Terrors they were
under, from their Arming themselves,
and putting themselves in a posture of
Defence,—When it was easy to see by
the nature of the thing, that their De∣sign
was <HI>not a War but a Ʋnion</HI> upon
just Conditions, that it was a plain
Token that they design'd either to put
some affront upon <HI>the Nolunarians,</HI> to
deny them some just Claims, or to im∣pose
something very Provoking upon
them more than they had yet done, that
<PB N="345" REF="351"/>
they were so exceeding fearful of an In∣vasion
from them.</P>
<P>Tho' these were sufficient to pass for
Reasons in other Cases, yet it could not
be so here, but I saw there must be some∣thing
else in it. As I was thus wondering
at this unusual backwardness of the Soul∣diers,
I enquir'd a little farther into the
meaning of it, and quickly found the Rea∣son
was plain, <HI>there was nothing to be got
by it,</HI> that People were <HI>Brave, Desperate</HI>
and <HI>Poor,</HI> the Country <HI>Barren,</HI> Moun∣tainous
and <HI>Empty,</HI> so that in short there
would be nothing but Blows, and <HI>Soul∣diers
Fellows</HI> to be had, and I always ob∣serv'd
that Souldiers never care to be
knockt on the Head, and get nothing by
the Bargain.</P>
<P>In short, I saw plainly the Reasons
that prompted the <HI>Solunarians</HI> to Insult
their Neighbours of the North, were
more deriv'd from the regret at their
Establishing <HI>Crolianism,</HI> than at any
real Causes they had given, or indeed
were in a condition to give them.</P>
<P>These, and abundance more particu∣lar
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
Observations I made, but as I left
the thing still in agitation, and unde∣termin'd,
I shall refer it to another Voy∣age
which I purpose to make thither,
and at my return, may perhaps set that
Case in a clearer Light than our Sight
can yet bear to look at it in.</P>
<P>If in my second Voyage I should un∣deceive
People in the Notions they en∣tertain'd
of those Northern People, and
convince them that the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
were really the Aggressors, and had put
great hardships upon them, I might
possibly do a Work, that if it met with
Encouragement, might bring the <HI>Solu∣narians</HI>
to do them Justice, and that
would set all to Rights, the two Nations
might easily become one, and Unite for
ever, or at least become Friends, and
give mutual Assistance to each other;
and I cannot but own such an Agreement
would make them both very formida∣ble,
but this I refer to another time.—</P>
<P>At the same time I cannot leave it with∣out
a Remark that this Jealousy between
the two Nations, may perhaps in future A∣ges
be necessary to be maintain'd, in order
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>
to find some better Reasons for <HI>Fortifi∣cations,
Standing Armies, Guards and
Garisons</HI> than could be given in the
Reign of the great Prince I speak of, the
Queen's Predecessor, tho' his was against
a Forreign insulting Enemy.</P>
<P>But the Temper of the <HI>Solunarian High
Party</HI> was always such, that they would
with much more ease give thanks for a
Standing Army against the <HI>Nolunarians
and Crolians,</HI> than agree to one Legion
against the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> and <HI>Galluna∣rians.</HI></P>
<P>But of these Things I am also promis'd
a more particular Account upon my
Journy into that Country.</P>
<P>I cannot however conclude this Mat∣ter,
without giving some Account of my
private Observations, upon what was
farther to be seen in this Country.</P>
<P>And had not my Remarks on their
State Matters taken up more of my
Thoughts than I expected, I might have
entred a little upon their other Affairs,
such as their <HI>Companies,</HI> their <HI>Commerce,</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
their <HI>Publick Offices,</HI> their <HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI>
their <HI>Temper,</HI> their <HI>Conversation,</HI> their
<HI>Woman,</HI> their <HI>Stages, Ʋniversities,</HI> their
<HI>Courtiers,</HI> their <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the Chara∣cters
of <HI>the severals</HI> under all these De∣nominations,
but these must be referr'd
to time, and my more perfect Observa∣tions.</P>
<P>But I cannot omit, that tho' have
very little Knowledge of Books, and
had obtain'd less upon their Language,
yet I could not but be very inquisitive
after their Libraries and Men of Let∣ters.</P>
<P>Among their Libraries I found not
abundance of their own Books, their
Learning having so much of De∣monstration,
and being very Hierogly∣phical,
but I found to my great Admi∣ration
vast quantities of Translated
Books out of all Languages of our
World.</P>
<P>As I thought my self one of the first,
at least of our Nation, that ever came
thus far; it was, you may be sure no small
surprize to me, to find all the most val∣luable
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
parts of Modern Learning, es∣pecially
of Politicks, Translated from
our Tongue, into the Lunar Dialect,
and stor'd up in their Libraries with the
Remarks, Notes and Observations of
the Learned Men of that Climate upon
the Subject.</P>
<P>Here, among a vast croud of <HI>French</HI>
Authors condemn'd in this polite World
for trifling, came a huge Volume con∣taining,
<HI>Les Oevres de scavans,</HI> which
has 19 small Bells painted upon the
Book of several disproportion'd sizes.</P>
<P>I enquir'd the meaning of that Hiero∣glyphick,
which the Master of the Books
told me, was to signify that the sub∣stance
was all Jingle and Noise, and
that of 30 Volumes which that one
Book contains, 29 of them have neither

in them.</P>

the vast varieties of which, and very en∣tertaining,
I observ'd but a few, such
as these:</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358"/>
1. Why Prince <HI>Ragotski</HI> will make
no Peace with the Emperor.—But more
particularly why the Emperor won't
make Peace with him.</P>
<P>2. Where the Policy of the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> lies, to persue the King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and let the <HI>Mascovites</HI> ravage and de∣stroy
his own Subjects.</P>

to himself in declaring for
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>4. Why the Protestants of the Confe∣deracy
never reliev'd the <HI>Camisars.</HI></P>

<P>6. Why the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> did not
take <HI>Madrid,</HI> why the <HI>English</HI> did not
take <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
not take <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> viz. because the first
were Fools, the second Knaves, and the
last <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>7. What became of all the Silver ta∣ken
at <HI>Vigo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="359"/>

produc'd between a Knave, a Coward,

<P>Abundance of these Mysteries are Hi∣eroglyphically
describ'd in this ample
