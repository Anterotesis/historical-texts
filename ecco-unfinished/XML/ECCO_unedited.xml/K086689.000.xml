<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE inimitable, and immortal, <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>, about a hun∣dred and thirty Years since, wrote a Play, on this Subject, and call'd it, The <HI>Life</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI>, the <HI>Fifth:</HI> — Mine is a <HI>New Fabrick</HI>, yet I built
<PB REF="4"/>
on <HI>His</HI> Foundation; and the Rea∣der, I am afraid, will, too easily, discover, without the Help of a Com∣parison, in what Places I am in∣debted to him.</P>
<P>The Success, which this Tragedy will meet with, on the Stage, is a Matter, of no Consequence: If it were otherwise, I shou'd be sorry, to have mistaken, so unseasonably, the Taste of the <HI>Fashionable!</HI> There is a Kind of <HI>Dumb Drama!</HI> a new, and wonderful, Discovery! that pla∣ces the <HI>Wit</HI> in the <HI>Heels!</HI> and the Experience of Both our Theatres might have taught any Writer, but so dull a one as I am, that the <HI>Har∣lequins</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>
are Gentlemen, of better In∣terest than the <HI>Harrys</HI>.</P>
<P>The Masters of the Stage act, like very discreet Judges: in falling in with a Humour, which they cou'd not have oppos'd but to their Disad∣vantage. What have <HI>They</HI> to do with <HI>Reason</HI>, to whom <HI>Folly</HI> is most profitable?— To sail, with Wind, and Tide, is safest, and most easy: Nor is it any Part of their Business, to stem the Current of the Times; and be <HI>Wise</HI>, with Empty Boxes.</P>
<P>No <HI>French Tricks</HI>, however, in the Days of <HI>my</HI> Hero, were able to
<PB REF="6"/>
stand before him: Fortune favour'd him, <HI>then</HI>, against incredible Odds! and who knows, (if the Ladies will forgive me the Presumption of com∣paring <HI>small</HI> Things with <HI>Great</HI>,) but he may, <HI>now</HI>, become a Match, even for <HI>Eunuchs</HI>, and <HI>Merry-An∣drews!</HI></P>
<P>Yet, the Victory, at <HI>Agencourt</HI>, was an Action, not more wonder∣ful! And it is, I fear, become im∣possible, since I have, imprudently, neglected to list those Squadrons of <HI>light-arm'd</HI> Forces, which have, so often, won the Day, for Our <HI>Lea∣ders</HI>, in modern Poetry.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>How poor a Thing is <HI>Fame</HI>, when so wretchedly <HI>caball'd</HI> for! It is hard to distinguish, which is strangest, and most ridiculous: the Noise, and Violence, of such Ap∣plause, in its first breaking out: or the Suddenness, with which it flat∣tens, and leaves the Monsters <HI>a∣ground!</HI> like that straggling Shoal of <HI>Whales</HI>, which the Sea has, lately, lifted into the Meadows of <HI>Ham∣borough</HI>.</P>
<P>After all, I am sanguine enough to hope, that a Taste for <HI>Tragedy</HI> may be restor'd:— Yet, who wou'd
<PB REF="8"/>
not despair of it, when It is desert∣ed by those Great Spirits, whose past Actions must adorn it! —When a Name may be read, in the List of <HI>Opera Directors</HI>, which will fur∣nish the Poets, of Ages, yet to come, with as wonderful a Chara∣cter! and with Conquests gain'd as nobly, over the <HI>French</HI>, and <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>, Arms, as any of the <HI>Ed∣wards</HI>, or the <HI>Henrys</HI>, have left us, by the most glorious of their anti∣ent Victories!</P>
<P>But, in all Events, I will be Easy, who have no better Reason to wish well to Poetry, than my Love for
<PB REF="9"/>
a <HI>Mistress</HI>, I shall never be <HI>married</HI> to: For, whenever I grow <HI>ambiti∣ous</HI>, I shall wish to <HI>build higher</HI>; and owe my <HI>Memory</HI> to some Oc∣casion, of more Importance, than my <HI>Writings</HI>.</P>

<L>We draw some rich Remains of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Praise.</L>
<L><HI>Shakespear!</HI> — the Sound bids charm'd Attention wake:</L>
<L>And our aw'd Scenes, with conscious Reve'rence, <HI>Shake!</HI></L>
<L>Arduous the Task, to mix with <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Muse!</L>
<L>Rash Game! where All, who play, are sure to lose.</L>
<L>Yet — what our Author <HI>cou'd,</HI> he dar'd to try:</L>
<L>And kept the fiery Pillar in his Eye.</L>
<L>Led by such Light, as wou'd not <HI>let</HI> him <HI>stray,</HI></L>
<L>He pick'd out <HI>Stars,</HI> from <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>milky Way</HI>.</L>

<L>Hid, in the Cloud of Battle, <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Care,</L>
<L>Blind, with the Dust of War, o'erlook'd the <HI>Fair:</HI></L>
<L>Fond of <HI>their</HI> Fame, we shew their Influence, here,</L>
<L>And place 'em, <HI>twinkling</HI> through War's smokey Sphere.</L>
<L>Without <HI>their</HI> Aid, we lose <HI>Love's</HI> quick'ning Charms;</L>
<L>And sullen Virtue <HI>mopes,</HI> in <HI>steril Arms</HI>.</L>
<L>Now, rightly mix'd, th' enliven'd Passions move:</L>
<L>Love <HI>softens</HI> War, — and War <HI>invigo'rates</HI> Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! — cry'd that tow'ring <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Stage,</HI></L>
<L>When, first, <HI>His Henry</HI> charm'd a former Age:</L>
<L>"Oh! for a Muse of <HI>Fire,</HI> our Cause to friend,</L>

<L>No barren Tale t' <HI>amuse,</HI> our Scene imparts:</L>

<L><HI>Here,</HI> with a <HI>silent Fire,</HI> a <HI>temper'd</HI> Heat!</L>
<L>Calmly resolv'd, our <HI>English</HI> Bosoms beat.</L>

<L><HI>Art</HI> is too poor, to raise the <HI>Dead,</HI> 'tis true:</L>

<LG>
<L>WE've shown Ye, Sirs! how <HI>France,</HI> of Old, was <HI>got:</HI></L>
<L>And, now, I'll tell ye, why we <HI>kept</HI> it <HI>not</HI>.—</L>
<L>This <HI>Hero</HI>'s Son and Heir,— no warring Ranger!</L>
<L>Lov'd <HI>Grace,</HI> obey'd his <HI>Wife,</HI> and <HI>hated Danger</HI>.</L>
<L><HI>Our Harry</HI> fought, all Day, and <HI>slept,</HI> all <HI>Night:</HI></L>
<L>Nor dreamt of gentler Joys, than those of <HI>Fight</HI>.</L>
<L>Tho' bold, in <HI>War,</HI> His Feats, in <HI>Love,</HI> were faint!</L>
<L>And this fam'd <HI>Champion</HI> gave the World a — <HI>Saint!</HI></L>
<L><HI>There</HI> was a <HI>Bliss!</HI> — Oh! how was <HI>Kate</HI> mistaken!</L>
<L>Such thund'ring <HI>Fame</HI> must <HI>mighty Hopes</HI> awaken:</L>
<L>But, tir'd with Action, Her <HI>Heroick</HI> Lover</L>
<L>Was found, in <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Wedlock,</HI> no great <HI>Mover</HI>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>There</HI> lay the <HI>Guilt:</HI> — nor went unpunish'd, long,</L>
<L><HI>Weak</HI> tho' the <HI>Son</HI> was, his Ill Fate was strong.</L>
<L>Urg'd by slack Reins, and, quite broke loose, at last,</L>
<L>The Horse of <HI>Power</HI> th' unequal Rider, <HI>cast</HI>.</L>
<L>Then rose Division, Faction, and Debate:</L>
<L>And That rank Weed, <HI>Rebellion,</HI> choak'd the State.</L>
<L>Plunder was <HI>Law;</HI> and Force, on both Sides, <HI>Right;</HI></L>
<L>And Rogues in Red <HI>ravish'd,</HI> with all their <HI>Might!</HI></L>
<L>Widows, and Wives, were <HI>task'd,</HI> to their <HI>full Skill:</HI></L>
<L>And stubborn <HI>Maids</HI> were — <HI>pleas'd,</HI> against their <HI>Will</HI>.</L>
<L><PB REF="13"/>No <HI>Plots,</HI> to hoodwink <HI>Horns,</HI> were, then of Use:</L>
<L>For the whole Sex made One allow'd Excuse:</L>
<L>Why, <HI>Dear,</HI> what <HI>Help for't?—I was vex'd, I swear,</HI></L>
<L>But— <HI>had not been so serv'd, had You been there</HI>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, for some grave <HI>Instruction,</HI> from the Play,</L>
<L>To send you, <HI>warn'd,</HI> as well as <HI>pleas'd,</HI> away!</L>
<L>Who, — by the Woes of a <HI>weak</HI> Prince's Rule,</L>
<L>Learns not, to <HI>bless</HI> the <HI>steddy, brave,</HI> and <HI>cool?</HI></L>
<L>All, that a Kingdom feels, of <HI>good,</HI> or <HI>ill,</HI></L>
<L>She owes, to her King's <HI>Weakness,</HI> or his <HI>Skill:</HI></L>
<L>Still, what the Monarch is, still, such the State,</L>
<L>For a <HI>King's Conduct</HI> is his <HI>People's Fate</HI>.</L>
