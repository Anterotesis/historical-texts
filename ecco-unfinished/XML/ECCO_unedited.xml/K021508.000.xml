<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Friendship which the Duke of Leeds has honoured me with for several years, in some Measure authorizes the Liberty I take of inscrib∣ing this Comedy to your Grace;—whilst the Favor he has so recently conferred upon me, by condescending to write a Prologue for my Play, makes me anxious to seize an early Opportunity of acknowledging to you, and to the World, how much I feel myself flatter'd by this Mark of his Regard.</P>
<P>The partial Encomiums, which your Grace be∣stowed upon my Comedy, when read last Winter amidst a private Circle of your Friends, led me to hope with some Degree of Confidence for that Success, which from the Indulgence of the Public, I have now experienced:—Sincerely wishing both
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
you and the Duke every domestic Enjoyment, and every permanent Happpiness, which your amiable Qualities so truly deserve, but which Rank and Fortune do not always ensure,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I have the Honor to be Madam, Your Grace's most Obedient And most devoted Servant,</SALUTE>

<P>TO the skilful Arrangement, and liberal Attention of Mr. Kemble, the Manager; the wonderful Exertions of Mrs. Jordan; and the united Abilities of all the Per∣formers, the Author is chiefly indebted for the Success of this Comedy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE,</HI> WRITTEN BY HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF LEEDS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, Jun.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>CUSTOM commands a Prologue to each Play;</L>
<L>But custom hath not told us what to say:</L>
<L>No form prescrib'd, 'tis difficult to find,</L>
<L>How to conciliate the Public mind.</L>
<L>The bashful Bard—the modest Muse's fears,</L>
<L>So long have jingled in your patient Ears,</L>
<L>That now, perhaps, you'll scarce vouchsafe to stay,</L>
<L>To hear both their Apology—and Play.</L>
<L>No! Better sure on him at once to call,</L>
<L>With—Sir, if frighten'd thus, why write at all?</L>
<L>We're not reduc'd yet to a trembling Pen;</L>
<L>Zounds, Bards, will croud us soon, like—Gentlemen.</L>
<L>Something like this, I heard a Friend once say,</L>
<L>Who wish'd (poor soul) to hear a new launch'd Play:</L>
<L>Box'd snug at first, completely to his mind,</L>
<L>With only one grave Auditor behind:</L>
<L>E'er the third Act had struggled to its end,</L>
<L>In reel'd three Critics, each the Author's Friend—</L>
<L>On Praise determin'd—Wit confirm'd by Wine;</L>
<L>Each And! and If! was chaste—correct—damn'd fine.</L>
<L>To Taste so mark'd, my Friend, of course, gave way;</L>
<L>But squeez'd, thump'd, kick'd—still listen'd to the Play;</L>
<L>Till by repeated Plaudits grown so Sore,</L>
<L>Nor Flesh nor Blood cou'd bear one Comment more.</L>
<L>Such boist'rous Friends they surely cannot need,</L>
<L>Who wish by Merit only to succeed.</L>
<L>To-night we offer to the Public view,</L>
<L>A Character, you'll own, perhaps, is new,</L>
<L>From Doctor's Commons we the Model draw;</L>
<L>A Promising Eleve of Civil Law;</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
And Civil sure that Law which can provide,</L>
<L>Or (shou'd need be) release you from a Bride.</L>
<L>Thrice bless'd the Mansion, where, in spite of ills</L>
<L><HI>Alive</HI> or <HI>dead,</HI> you still can have your Wills.</L>
<L>Much cou'd I offer in our Author's cause;</L>
<L>Nay, prove his first great object—your applause;</L>
<L>But, least dull Friendship shou'd his Genius wrong,</L>
<L>I'll stop—before the Prologue grows too long,</L>
<L>And <HI>Better late than never</HI> hold my Tongue.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, this is what I dreaded, tho' no more than I had reason to expect—by your being the bearer

of this letter, I am to suppose your lovely Mistress agrees with her Guardian.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, she is quite agreable—as we say—you have so often promis'd to reform, and so often broke your promise,—that—</P>

<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Diary; but whatever I may feel, I have still pride enough to applaud her conduct, and con∣demn my own—tell her so, Diary, and tell her besides, tho' I have adored her from life's early period, and whilst I have breath can never cease to love her; yet—but no matter—'tis now too late—</P>

<SP>

<P>Now—this very moment—the best of Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Woman—thank Heaven it's no worse. I thought you had lost the other half of your Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortune! I have lost Augusta—the source—the summit of my hopes.—Read that letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(reads).</STAGE> Why how has this happen'd—you are not more of a libertine than you were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But am I not more involv'd? Is not my fortune squander'd—gone—am I not discarded by my Uncle, the only relation I have that can assist me—without friends—almost without resource.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, never droop man—write to your Uncle, promise reformation—talk of prudence and parsimony—get him to raise the wind—and then for another venture: fortune you know must wheel about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, you revive me. I'll not give way to despondence—I will write to my Uncle—tho' what hopes can I entertain from such an avaricious dis∣position—mean while I have scarce a guinea to throw n the way of the blind Goddess, were she inclin'd to favour me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let that distress you—tho' <HI>I</HI> have not the means, our new Friend will be here in an instant, and he is both liberal and capable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our new Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the Young Hussar officer with the wound in his forehead, who, from his long residence
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
abroad, has been stiled the Chevalier.—See here he is, and as gay and lively as ever.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Augusta,</HI> in an Hussar dress, singing.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Care flies from the lad that is merry, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<P>How fares it, my Heroes—heh!—melancholy, Saville, What's the matter with you?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush!—don't interrupt him—he's thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thinking! Sure he can't be so unfashion∣able. What, turn'd Philosopher, Saville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville,</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Chevalier—I wish I cou'd—but every man ruminates on his losses, and mine are irrecover∣able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if money will replace them. Come, come, my friend, you lost a few thousands last night, I won them, and if the loan will assist you, you may command me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, serious as a Philosopher.—Here—in this pocket-book are notes for near 5,000<HI>l.</HI> take and make the most of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, without thinking when and how you are to be repaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thinking again, Saville—psha!—what's the use of thinking?—true Genius is above it—it al∣ways acts by instinct: so take the money, and if you wou'd oblige me, say no more about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark ye, Chevalier, if instinct will prompt you to find another pocket-book—give it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is the most extraordinary act, Chevalier, but without you name some mode of re∣payment, upon my honour, I cannot accept—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop! I'll settle the difference. You seem not to want the money, and he seems not to want the security: now I want the money, and have no security to give. So the business is settled at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Chevalier, rather than our friend's archness shou'd have no effect, I will accept your offer on one condition—instantly take my bond, payable in
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
three days, and by that time, if my Lawyer has not deceiv'd—aye, my Estate will be sold, and I shall be in possession of thrice the sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if you will have it so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I will have it no other way—I'll go and prepare the bond this instant. Sir Charles, you will be kind enough to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, leave me to manage where any thing is to be got <STAGE>[aside to Saville, who goes out].</STAGE> Bravo, my dear Cousin, Augusta—bravo—you play your part ex∣cellently; in this disguise it is impossible he shou'd know you—why I scarce know you myself. Let me look at you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! this further supply will draw him deeper in the toils—for if he plays again and loses—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which he certainly will.—I have se∣cur'd the loaded Dice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have secur'd the Lawyer—the very man he has employed to raise him more money, is my particular friend—so when I can get the Deeds, the Property, and the Estate, into my own hands—my purpose is effected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you seriously wish to compleat his ruin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seriously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there's the mystery—one day or other you shall know—in the mean time be assur'd I love him more than ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why not marry him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, to prevent the flame from increas∣ing—heh! Mr. Joker—no—no—besides my Guar∣dian will not consent, or, if he wou'd, my heart and fortune wou'd both be squander'd away upon a des∣perate Game of Chance. With submission, I must have better security for my affection, than your loaded Dice, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it's not my affair—only remem∣ber our agreement—I am to assist you in stripping him; and you are to help me in improving my ward∣robe.</P>

<P>Without doubt—if thro' your means I succeed in the enterprize, you shall receive my warmest thanks; and a pocket-book into the bargain.</P>

<P>How, on your knees, Sir Charles!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my knees—I cou'd fall prostrate at the feet of the Chevalier, for his generosity to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly! I owe him every grateful ac∣knowledgement; but I never prostrate myself, except to the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, Saville—I never desire to see you so, but in that capacity.—Oh! this is the bond is it; and now, I hope, your cares are at an end.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would they were!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! what a sigh was there; why sure you are not in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in love; why, poor fellow—he has just receiv'd his <HI>Coup de Grace</HI>—the Lady has seen somebody she likes better—perhaps <HI>you,</HI> or <HI>me,</HI> Che∣valier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you say, she may have seen me; and who knows but I may be as likely to please her as any body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very true, upon my honour—the Lady is my relation; and if you wish to be acquaint∣ed, I'll introduce you whenever you please—indeed, she's a very charming girl.</P>

<P>Nay, she is a perfect Angel—me∣thinks I see her now before me—with her arch look, and roguish leer—such charming talents—such vivacity with so much feeling.</P>

<P>Yes, the club are to dine with me—I shall expect you both.—Chevalier, this loan of yours, has given me new life.</P>

<P>Yes, and it will give the club new life too.—Adieu, Saville—Don't lose your spirits man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>No none of your woe-begone looks;—but put on a chearful countenance.—Zounds, love—I laugh at it. I know no woman I like better than myself. Lookye, I'll stand your friend, Saville: Sir Charles shall introduce me to the cruel fair one; and if I don't laugh her into something, say I am not the Chevalier—that's all my boy; if I don't make her resume herself—say I'm not the Chevalier.—Come along Baronet. <STAGE><HI>(Exit with</HI> Sir Charles.)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flurry.</SPEAKER>

<P>Don't distress yourself on that ac∣count any longer. I can't see why my youth should be wasted, any my natural endowments lost, where there is neither taste to relish, or anxiety to preserve.</P>

<P>So would all your sex, if they had the op∣portunity. A rake is your delight, and his youth your excuse.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>A VERY fine woman indeed, as I us'd to say to my wife. I wonder who she can be; my good friend Sir Charles Chouse, who introduc'd her here for a touch of my art, has never yet favour'd me with her name—wonder at that too—as I am in most of the Baronet's secrets—but great men have their mysteries, and seldom open the budget, without a little reserve at bottom.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, you're a d—mn'd wicked, good sort of a fellow, that's the truth of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice to find you so early abroad—before, as I may say, the sun has risen, or the nobility got up—but—indeed, the morning air makes gentlemen look as if they wou'd live for ever.—As a painter, I quite rejoice.—As a physician, I shou'd die myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Pallet—I believe I do look toler∣ably; but thou hast a pretty way of touching up a picture—What think you of my fair friend on your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anvass there?</P>

<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine subject, indeed, for a brush—exqui∣site complexion, charming features, beautiful locks, and a rich prospect in the back ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take great care then—that she is not canvass'd elsewhere.—Mum, is the word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mute as my own Pallet—people who talk only betray secrets, and talking of talking; I know when it's proper not to talk at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Betwixt ourselves—She is actually a married woman; whose husband is as rich as Croesus, and who knows but, with a little management, I may be able to dip in the same purse. She is confoundedly virtuous at present—but she has a damn'd deal of dis∣cernment, and that's all in my favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she will soon improve in good com∣pany, indeed she begins to appear like a woman of fashion already; for she talks loud, tho' she has no∣thing to say—forever in a bustle, tho' she has nothing to do; and beyond all, thinks she excels in painting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she does—you may see that in her countenance; but the best of the joke is—that, tho' I have been acquainted with her some time, I have never once seen her husband.—She tells me—he is always sick, and I am not sorry—</P>

<P>No, I wish you did interrupt business—I have some reason to suspect a lady of mine being too partial to a dissipated rake of a baronet—Don't you think it very rascally, sir, in a man of fashion, to at∣tack any gentleman's wife, who is a quiet peaceable, good sort of man, and attacks no body.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Litig.</SPEAKER>
<P>My business is every where, never out of my way; if parties are adverse, there am I—if amica∣ble, here stands Liti—a wedding, or a divorce, abuse or praise—fill but the parchment—enough for the proctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop his mouth Pallet—Gad, this friend of your's Mr. Flurry, is a very facetious fellow, ha! ha! a very pleasant fellow indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flurry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he came to my house pleasantly and told me a very pleasant story, advis'd a pleasant mode of redress, and now seems as pleasant about it as if no∣thing had happen'd—Don't you think so my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flurry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, a very pleasant busi∣ness altogether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Litig.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(to Pallet)</STAGE> Sir Charles, a generous client you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(to Litig.)</STAGE> As a prince—besides he wants nothing of the lady but a little loose cash perhaps, that he may reward his friends the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Litig</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(to Pallet).</STAGE> Always open to conviction, and love to prevent animosities.—<STAGE>(To the company)</STAGE> A very whimsical mistake indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flurry.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you are in the mistake too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Litig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes.—Nothing so common in practice; my friend Mr. Pallet assures me, there cannot be a more striking likeness, than the one to the other, and dare say, Mr. Flurry is perfectly convinced that Mr. Tomkins, Jenkyns, what's his name, was a most de∣sirable woman, and shou'd my client wish for the pic∣ture—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flurry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh don't mention it; I never desire to see their likeness again, let's be gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Litig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, de Mortuis nil—please you an arm for each, Between man and wife, who so proper to di∣rect the path—lead them right—tread lightly o'er—<STAGE>(Treads accidently on Flurry's toe.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Oh dear—I shall never tread again—I have no foot left. I shall sink—Oh! oh!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>This cursed picture has been very un∣fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>An unlucky stroke, but pretty well var∣nish'd over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That quivering fool will never suffer his wife to come here again, and he and his proctor together may so watch her motions, that I despair of getting a separate interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's hard upon us artists, that a lady mayn't set where she pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I'm determin'd to execute a plan which I have sometime had in my head; will you assist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What the great man who cures by a look?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that makes the dumb to roar a catch, and teaches the gouty to dance a hornpipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir Charles, he's a most wonderful genius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>True! then what do you think of passing for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I—imitate the great man—impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so—I'm sure you are quite as wonderful a fellow—I'll be your assistant.—Go and procure us a couple of suitable disguises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, quite new—hitherto I have only painted others—I must now go and try to paint my∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lose no time—at present, I have an∣other engagement on my hands.—Adieu—I've no doubt of success as I've such a damn'd wicked good sort of a fellow for an ally. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I am not so ambitious—I hate wine.—You forgot I have lived abroad, Saville—I can't sit like a dull Englishman, a whole afternoon, grinning at table jokes, and prosing over politics—My mind is active—all life and fire.</P>

<P>Come, come, confess, you are going to sigh away the evening with some fair incognita.</P>

<P>Oh! Perhaps to judge of the play, by a lounge in the lobby—or enjoy the Opera, by a strut in the coffee-room—or else, take a nap in the gallery of the House of Commons, to prove my patriotism;—in short, like the bulk of mankind, any where to avoid reflection.</P>

<P>His nephew! as I live, old Grump. He is rich, and I may assist Saville, without injuring my my own designs <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Oh, Sir, I ask ten thou∣sand pardons; your nephew is quite an alter'd man.</P>

<SPEAKER>Grump.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right—hate old friends; apt to borrow money.—Don't much like new ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wise maxim, Sir, therefore I should be happy to borrow a little, as being neither one nor t'other; for betwixt ourselves, your nephew is grown so close of late—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grump.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think he is—keeps close in his hole—Why not come out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I mean close fisted, penurious, wary. I dare say he outdoes you in every thing:—you keep no servants, perhaps, and only starve yourself;—now he keeps several, and starves them and himself too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grump.</SPEAKER>
<P>Starves them, does he? Then you are not one of his keeping, that's certain. However, if he is so miserable, step on—enjoy it with him.</P>

<P>Stop! stop! You hav'n't heard all yet—He is grown excessively fond of study, and is at this moment up to the elbows in Blackstone.</P>

<P>Stay, Sir, I'll explain the whole affair:—The fact is this—Men of the first character and learn∣ing, who countenance your nephew, are met in the next room, to discuss literary subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grump.</SPEAKER>
<P>Literati; what in blue stockings, heh!

<P>Stop, Sir—for Heaven's sake, Sir, stop! If they see you, they may grow desperate; they may lampoon you—write your life.</P>

<P>Stop your tongue—Don't you see?</P>

<P>Indeed, Sir, you misunderstand him: they may have been drinking a little to quicken their fancy, and deciding their controversial subjects by betting.—Nothing so common, is it Charles?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You never were more out in your life; come along with me, old Crabstick, and I'll give you ocular proof, proof positive, my Trojan. There—seven's the main, and nothing's the chance;—now are you satisfied?</P>

<P>No; never saw him in my life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>BRAVO, Master Pallet! Excellent—how well one painter can copy another. You look like the real Doctor Hubblebubble himself. I always said you had a good knack at disguise. What think you of me for your journeyman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not an apothecary's 'prentice in town can be better prepar'd for a pestle and mortar; and, with submission, I may say, disguise sits natural upon us both.</P>

<P>I have borrow'd this old house, and provided the trumpery that you see, to give a better colour to the plan.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pallet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you sure, Flurry will venture hi∣ther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite certain; I knew he had heard of Dr. Hubblebubble's late fame in magnetism, and other modern wonders; therefore sent him a line in the Doctor's name, assuring him that he wou'd make a complete cure of him, gratis, for the sake of his own reputation. You may easily imagine our valetudina∣rian bit at the proposal.</P>

<SPEAKER>Diary.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may be so inquisitous as to ask, your name is Mr. Lawyer Gab. I waited on you from my mistress, Miss Augusta Melmouth. Lord, Mr. Saville here; who would have supposed it? But I beg pardon, as Orestes said to his friend, Pilgarlic—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what of your lady? don't be afraid of me. I hope she is well, and I ought to wish that she is happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now to act my part as well as my mistress <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE> Nay, as for the matter of that, my young lady wants nothing—that is, nothing more than other young ladies want too. She wish'd to know whether Mr. Lawyer here, had examin'd the marriage articles on her side, and whether Mr. Lawyer on t'other side had examin'd them too; and whether they were ready on both sides;—and so I came to enquire, like the Busy Body there, in the Way of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you say? Marriage articles!—Sure your young lady, Augusta, is not going to be married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, and why not? If gentlemen deal cards one way, ladies must play their cards another, as Skippio says, in Gil Blas. Don't you think so, Mr. Lawyer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Skippio! Never saw an opinion of his in my life; but as to cards, if two females engage with one gentleman, it's odds but he'll be put to his trumps.</P>

<P>Permit me, Mrs. Diary to ask only one question—Who is destin'd to be the possessor of that heart the proudest might a spire to; and which once the humblest was bold enough to solicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>I swear by the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izes, Mr. Saville, but you seem as if, as how you wan ted to take a client out of

my hands, if the young lady chuses to marry. If A. wants to join issue with B. what has D. to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, what has D. to do with issue? So, pray let us alone Mr. Saville; and do you, Mr. Law∣yer, be pleas'd to send home the marriage ceremonies, that my mistress may put her hand to them as soon as possible; for when we women take a thing in our heads, we are determined to go through with it, as Caesar says in his dictionary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ought certainly to beg your pardon for the earnestness of my enquiries; but the Lady men∣tion'd, was one, whom I was once weak enough—But no matter—I shall only intrude further on your pa∣tience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, I feel interested in that warmth which does you so much honour—but perhaps the Lady may be ignorant of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not now material—Bless me, I have exceeded my time; I have an appointment with Sir Charles Chouse, which obliges me to be punctual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obliges you to be punctual—there is surely something in your manner that seems to indicate, what I hope is not true, that you have an affair of ho∣nour on your hands—Can I be of service?</P>

<P>Sure, Sir, I ought to be surpris'd at the alteration of your stile.</P>

<P>WE women are always upon the Change, as they say in the City, and I am sure my mistress wou'd make an excellent weathercock. Once I thought she was all love and rapture about poor Mr. Saville; but now—Oh, here she is, <HI>propria quae maribus,</HI> as the Heathens call it.</P>

<P>Better one shou'd be ruin'd, than both of of us, Diary. What prospect of happiness can I have with a man, whose irregularity of life is so conspicu∣ous, his rage for play is equall'd only by the incon∣stancy of his heart—Mrs. Flurry.</P>

<P>Not to be depended on Diary, in the least—light and unsettled in his nature; he flies from one scene of dissipation to another. On hearing, as I sup∣pose, of the discovery at the painter's, and finding his inamorata as faithless as himself, he had immediate re∣course to the gaming table, and there lost every far∣thing of that money, which I had, under my assum'd character, taken so much pains to supply him with.</P>

<P>Yes, Madam, I see how it is. Too late I find, of what little moment my peace of mind is to you: Saville, the proud, the prosperous, and the affluent, you might have condescended to receive;—but poor, abject, and disconsolate; his fortunes ruin'd, and his heart broke down, not only Love disdains, but even Pity will not spare a sigh.

<P>Sir, I scorn, in either instance, an action so dishonourable; my exertions, in behalf of your Lady, will, if you give yourself the trouble to enquire into them, entitle me to your regard; my attachment to your ward, Augusta, was, on my part, sincere; but to spare you any further uneasiness, on that head, you will find she is going to bestow her hand on an∣other more conformable to her inclinations; and I am free to confess, better adapted to promote her views in life—Farewell. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>You have hitherto so carefully avoid∣ed all proper explanation, and have so greedily listen'd to every reproachful censure on your wife, that I am at length wearied of endeavouring to exculpate my∣self—your senseless jealousy distresses me every day more and more, and if you cannot grow more gene∣rous, I am determin'd to leave you, and retire into the country.</P>

<P>Talk not of love—had I possess'd the wealth of India, and you had continu'd the same ten∣der, faithful fair, my fond heart once thought you; tho' poor and friendless, a wanderer thro' the world, bereft of every thing but truth and virtue, I wou'd have snatch'd you to my shelt'ring breast, and shar'd with you each blessing I enjoy'd—Talk not of love, you know it but my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your mistaken opinion, Sir, moves my pity, not my anger; I will now confess that once I cherish'd for you as pure and ardent a flame as ever warm'd a youthful bosom. You first engag'd my un∣suspecting heart—even in the dawn of life, I lov'd you; and 'mid the gladsome round of childish joys, my little fluttering breast preferr'd its Saville.</P>

<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Sir. As we advanc'd in years, I beheld, heaven knows what agony it gave me—I be∣held you wedded to dissipation—to every species of riot, intemperance and extravagance; while a deter∣min'd and desperate attachment to the gaming table engag'd your whole soul, and mark'd you for destruc∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, conscious of my weakness, you prudently united with your friends, to profit by my distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else remain'd for me? instead of the flattering prospect my early fancy pictur'd, I saw attendant upon you, only ruin and dismay. Instead of a discreet, affectionate husband to guide and protect me; instead of a tender companion to cheer the walk of life, to sooth the little cares we all must know, and share the tranquil pleasures of a peaceful home, what did your conduct offer to my view? a sullen partner of an unquiet dwelling—his temper sour'd by disap∣pointment—his mind alienated from his family—his house a torment—his wife a burthen, and himself a victim to despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Add to the picture a base designing woman, who, lost to every sense of generosity and honour, meanly took advantage of that unhappy victim's folly to aggrandize her own fortune, and bestow it on ad∣venturers as worthless as herself.</P>

<P>Grant me patience—unfeeling harden'd woman, on this head, at least, I have a right to ques∣tion you; Why did you enrich yourself at my ex∣pence? Why did you pursue me thus in various shapes to abet my follies, and hasten my undoing—could you not be blest unless I was miserable; what, what cou'd induce you to swell your cup of happiness with the embitter'd dregs of my misfortunes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augusta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love—that powerful passion which you say I know not, but by name; if I laid aside the deli∣cacy of my sex, 'twas but to save you from ruin—if I won your money, 'twas to secure it from the hands of sharpers—if I got possession of your deeds—'twas but to keep them from the clutches of the usurer, and if I have procur'd a licence for my marriage, I have procur'd it in my Saville's name, and shall be proud and blest to share it with him.—</P>

<P>Joy! Joy! my Client—Defendant there seems to have money enough now to pay damages—No com∣promise I beseech you—here's a brief sufficient to blacken the whole sex.</P>

<P>Too late for such kindness—a day after the fair, Eh, Master Blackball—No more Sophas—done with peep bo—Cut up brief for patty pans.—</P>

<P>Eh! what! no divorce—no action?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr. Hoodwink—not one doctor of civil law to speak upon the case, and what is worse, none of my notes in your pocket.</P>

<P>To tell you the truth Liti—You discover'd so little, and I have found out so much, that I don't wish to be exposed any further.</P>

<SPEAKER>Liti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly right my client—As well pay for silence as loquacity—Put up my brief, and make pro∣per charges—As there is no divorce—I am right happy to hear the next best thing—a marriage is going to take place—You and this lady I presume, sir,—never saw a finer couple—make no doubt but she's the most amiable of her sex at present—but shou'd any little ac∣cident

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. JORDAN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Drama done, and all it's Int'rest over,</L>
<L>Content the Husband, and secure the Lover;</L>
<L>Our timid Bard, who dreads the Critic ire,</L>
<L>And thinks my little Tongue can never tire,</L>
<L>Wou'd have me re-assume the Wig and Gown,</L>
<L>To plead his Goose-quill Cause before the Town▪</L>
<L>Lord, Sir, says I, some better Council bring;</L>
<L>For Females in a Wig are not the Thing.</L>
<L>Your bearded Barrister, if smartly made, is</L>
<L>A surer Advocate among the Ladies.</L>
<L>Madam, he cried, or perriwig'd, or bare▪</L>
<L>So you but talk, I never need despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suppose ye Fair, as I'm so <HI>smooth</HI> a Prater▪</L>
<L>I take a Line more consonant to Nature:</L>
<L>Give up the vain Attempt your hearts to warm,</L>
<L>And 'gainst the Men, with Female Weapon Arm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft have the Wits, unmindful whom they vex,</L>
<L>Expos'd the Foibles of the softer Sex.</L>
<L>Laugh'd at their Dress, their well-shap'd Cork, their▪ Feathers,</L>
<L>Their steady Bloom, unchanging in all Weathers;</L>
<L>Swore Locks were Grey, that seem'd a comely Brown▪</L>
<L>And, though all paid for, deem'd them not their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why not retort? Avenge the insulted Fair,</L>
<L>And shew these Men, what wond'rous things they are▪</L>
<L>Now don't be frighten'd—poor eccentric Elves,</L>
<L>I only shew what most you like—yourselves▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How! tremble at a Woman! Shame betide—</L>
<L>Tho' I look fierce, like you—I'm all outside:</L>
<L>Yet, e'er my efforts your attention call,</L>
<L>To that dear Portrait, which should hit you all,</L>
<L>Let me delineate what was once a Beau,</L>
<L>The Band-box Billy, of some years ago.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="72"/>
<L>Sweet Image of Mamma, in ev'ry Feature,</L>
<L>The Youth came forth, a most delicious creature,</L>
<L>With full dress'd Skirts, not quite unlike a Hoop,</L>
<L>Hat under Arm, fine Button, and gilt Loop—</L>
<L>Stiff Stock, long Sword, still dangling in the way,</L>
<L>He sometimes ventur'd to a first-night Play:</L>
<L>Tripp'd through the Lobby, most completely curl'd;</L>
<L>Nor did a paw-paw Thing for all the World.</L>
<L>Thus he discours'd, "Sir Dilberry, od's so,</L>
<L>Dear, dear, good-lack! have you a Place below?</L>
<L><HI>Dem</HI> it, don't crowd so, fellow—Oh! how shocking!</L>
<L>He's spoil'd my Hair, and dirtied all my Stocking."</L>
<L>Such was the Smart our Grandmama's would praise,</L>
<L>Rather unlike the Smart of present days.</L>
<L>For I defy all History to shew,</L>
<L>One thing in Nature, like a Modern Beau;</L>
<L>Hat slouch'd, short Stick▪ Knee Trappings, that bring back,</L>
<L>The Memory of renown'd Sixteen String Jack:</L>
<L>Eternal Boots, and Collar, you'd suppose,</L>
<L>Cut, in kind contact, with his Buckship's Nose.</L>
<L>Thus trimly deck'd, each night among the Doxies,</L>
<L>He storms the Lobby, and assails the Boxes;</L>
<L>With Gait and Manner—something in this way,</L>
<L>Proves his rare Taste, and descants on the Play—</L>
<L>"Here, Box-keeper! why don't the Rascal come?</L>
<L>Halloa—Tom Gerkin! can you give us room?</L>
<L>What this?—The Farce—Macbeth—an Opera?—Oh!</L>
<L>Came out last Season—stupid stuff—damn'd low:</L>
<L>Zounds let's be off;—Z—ds be a little calmer;</L>
<L>Who's that, the <HI>Jordan?</HI>—No, you Fool—R. Palmer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus some are found, by every Act revealing,</L>
<L>Perfect Indifference to Sense and Feeling.</L>
<L>To such our Play not sues;—but you, ye Fair,</L>
<L>Ye wise, whom Nature form'd with happier care,</L>
<L>Whose tender Bosoms, tho' by Passions rent,</L>
<L>Feel the soft Virtues in their full extent.</L>
<L>Cherish our Author's Plan, which aims to prove,</L>
<L>Life's best exertions spring from Virtuous Love.</L>
