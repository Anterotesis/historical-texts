<P>THE
SIEGE of SINOPE.</P>
<P>A
TRAGEDY.</P>
<P>As it is Acted at the
THEATRE ROYAL,
IN
COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>BY MRS. BROOKE,
AUTHOR OF JULIA MANDEVILLE, &amp;c.</P>
<P>LONDON:
PRINTED FOR T. CADELL, IN THE
STRAND.
<ABBR>MDCCLXXXI.</ABBR></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this tragedy has
met with from an indulgent publick, at a
period when the shafts of undistinguishing ridicule
have been (I think, injudiciously) pointed at this
noble and affecting species of the drama, calls for
my warmest acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Nor must my acknowledgments stop here. To
Mr. HARRIS my obligations are great: his good
sense and taste called my attention to more than
one impropriety in the conduct of the piece; when
first offered; his liberal turn of mind gave it every
advantage of decoration; whilst his candour and
politeness removed the dragons which have been
supposed to guard the avenues to the theatre, and
which have too long deterred many of our greatest
writers from taking this road to the Temple of
Fame.</P>
<P>A conduct like his cannot fail of having the
happiest effects on the world of literature; of
pluming once more the eagle wing of genius, till
it soars to that great sublime which characterized
the writers of ancient Greece; and, in later times,
our immortal father of the drama.</P>
<P>To the performers in general I am obliged for
their attention and propriety in their different cha∣racters.</P>
<P>Mr. HENDERSON, by his excellent and animated
performance, places in the strongest point of light
the amiable virtues, unaffected grandeur of soul,
and heroic ardour, which it was my aim to picture
in PHARNACES.</P>
<P>Mr. AICKIN fills with equal propriety and spirit
the vindictive part of ATHRIDATES; and Mr.
CLARK, by the justness of his action, and respec∣tableness
of his deportment, gives an authority to
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the character of ORONTES, which adds very greatly
to its effect.</P>
<P>I am now to speak of Mrs. YATES. My friend∣ship
for her, a friendship founded not more on my
admiration of her uncommon talents, than on the
worthy qualities of her heart, with which a series
of years have made me perfectly acquainted, ren∣der
it as hard a task for me to speak of her as of
myself. I feel a diffidence which impedes my
wish to do her justice, even at the moment when
I am most sensible how much my feeble attempts
to touch the nobler passions of the soul owe to
her astonishing exertion in the character of THA∣MYRIS.</P>
<P>But the publick have spoken for me; have
given just applause to that sublime sensibility, that
enthusiastic fire, those exquisite graces of action,
which compel even FRANCE itself, however tena∣cious
of native merit, to rank her with a DU∣MESNIL,
a CLAIRON.</P>
<P>It remains only to return my thanks to those
gentlemen who favoured me with the Prologue
and Epilogue: the good sense, poetic spirit, and
flowing numbers, of the former, were finely ex∣pressed
by Mr. HENDERSON; whilst the good-humoured
and lively raillery of the latter, which
so happily (and I have authority to say, without
an idea of personality) catches the reigning follies
of the hour, gave full scope to the comic powers
of Mrs. YATES.</P>
<P>I should here have finished this address, had not
the mistake of a Critic, who has read the English
opera of PHARNACES, instead of the Italian one,
from whence I had the first idea of my sable, led
him, though otherwise favourable in his strictures,
to accuse me of an illiberality, of which I should
detest myself if I was capable, that of sacri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icing
the other characters to my friendship for Mrs.
YATES. She wants no such unworthy sacri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice;
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
her native powers will ever support themselves:
if she appears more on the scene, 'tis from the
nature of the fable, which rendered it impossible
to make a different arrangement.</P>
<P>Comparatively short as the character of PHAR∣NACES
necessarily is, I flatter myself it is not void of
interest; instead of humbling him at the feet of a
foreign general (for POMPEY is the real hero of the
Opera) I have endeavoured to restore him to the
dignity of royalty; have aimed at representing him
a patriot, hero, king, the defender and father of his
people; not an abject dependent on the haughty
caprice, the tyrannic insolence, of the ROMANS.</P>
<P>As to the child, the Italian author has judged as
I have done; and not hazarded introducing him
as a speaker in the drama; therefore I cannot with
any justice be accused of withdrawing, in compli∣ment
to my friend, a situation which never existed
in the author from whom I borrowed the first idea
of my subject.</P>
<P>What effect the contrary conduct in the English
Opera might have had, it is impossible for me to
judge, as I was abroad at the time when it was
represented; but I own I should have trembled at
hazarding, in the character of an infant, an effort
of heroism, which only reflection on the relative
duties of child and parent, at a much more ad∣vanced
age, could have rendered probable.</P>
<P>I mean not by this to condemn the author of the
English Opera, but to exculpate myself. I have
too good an opinion of his judgment not to suppose
the circumstance might have effect; and an opera
is exempt from that severity of criticism to which
a tragedy must ever be subject.</P>
<P>It is perhaps right to observe, that some lines
which were judiciously omitted in the represen∣tation
are restored; but so few that I thought it
unnecessary to mark them.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by the Rev. Mr. COLLIER,
And spoken by Mr. HENDERSON.</BYLINE>
<L>IN vain would satire, with misguided rage,</L>
<L>Defame the manners of a polish'd age;</L>
<L>As if, attach'd to dissipation's wheel,</L>
<L>Our hearts had lost both power and wish to feel:</L>
<L>When passion's shafts with intermingled flight,</L>
<L>From pleasing pain produce severe delight;</L>
<L>When sorrow weeps, with present woes opprest,</L>
<L>Or joy for terrors past rears high its crest,</L>
<L>Nature triumphant will uphold her sway,</L>
<L>And all submissive her command obey.</L>
<L>Thus, on perfection's height we gaze intent,</L>
<L>But who shall dare to climb the sleep ascent?</L>
<L>When hope so frequent mourns its own disgrace,</L>
<L>And checks our ardor in th' adventurous race?</L>
<L>With doubting step, and agitated mien,</L>
<L>Our bard advances on the stormy scene;</L>
<L>Rejects the succour of pretended art,</L>
<L>And builds no flattering hope, but on the heart.</L>
<L>Nor will I longer spread the thin disguise,</L>
<L>A woman here the plaintive tale supplies;</L>
<L>On virtue's base she rears the female throne,</L>
<L>Calls forth your feelings, as she paints her own:</L>
<L>Whate'er in wedded love the breast can warm,</L>
<L>Or give to filial bonds their highest charm;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Whate'er emotions through the bosom dart,</L>
<L>For pangs which keenest pierce a parent's heart;</L>
<L>Here shall her feeble hand attempt to raise.</L>
<L>Give us your tears, we ask no truer praise.</L>
<L>What though the gentler sex of late have shown</L>
<L>At least a right to share the poet's crown,</L>
<L>Still has imperious man assum'd the claim</L>
<L>Round merit's brow to bind the wreath of fame;</L>
<L>Assert yourselves, ye fair! this chosen night,</L>
<L>And prove your powers to judge as well as write:</L>
<L>Thus man, with pride reluctant, shall confess,</L>
<L>Each Muse may justly wear a woman's dress:</L>
<L>To your indulgence shall his rigour bend,</L>
<L>Nor dare to censure what your tears commend.</L>

<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND,

<LG>
<L>IN all this bustle, rage, and tragic roar,</L>
<L>Which some wits here politely call a <HI>bore,</HI></L>
<L>Have I not wept, and rav'd, and tore my hair,</L>
<L>Till some I forc'd to weep, and some to stare?</L>
<L>Yet now I must, by custom, to divert you,</L>
<L>Tell what I think of this heroic virtue.</L>
<L>Mirth has <HI>increas'd,</HI> when tragedies are finish'd,</L>
<L>Increases <HI>still, and must not be</HI> diminish'd.</L>
<L>Alive your passion tho' our play may keep,</L>
<L>Behind the curtain you must have a peep.</L>
<L>Tho' bright the tragic character appear,</L>
<L>Our private foibles you delight to hear.</L>
<L>In life's great drama the same rule we find:</L>
<L>When on that stage the patron of mankind</L>
<L>Performs his part—the public virtues strike,</L>
<L>But 'tis the secret anecdote we like.</L>
<L>If there a Patriot rave with furious might,</L>
<L>And love his country—out of downright spite;</L>
<L>It passes for a copy of his face;</L>
<L>Has he not been to Court to beg a Place?</L>
<L>When some bright Orator his country's cause</L>
<L>Sustains, and talks of Liberty and Laws,</L>
<L><HI>Hear, hear,</HI> all cry; in attitude he stands,</L>
<L>Sprawling his feet, and stretching forth his hands:</L>
<L>“In this petition, Sir—the nation begs;</L>
<L>And, Mr. Speaker—while I'm upon my legs;</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="78"/>
And, Sir—our ancestors—and whig and tory;</L>
<L>And, Sir—the laws;—and, Sir—Great Britain's
glory!”</L>
<L>All gaze; all wonder; such amazing powers!</L>
<L>But how does he employ his private hours?</L>
<L>The nation sav'd, he hurries, in a trice,</L>
<L>To shake the box, and be undone at dice.</L>
<L>Some Politicians figure in debate,</L>
<L>Then sleep—to shew the quiet of the State.</L>
<L>Your Hollanders, when treachery is ripe,</L>
<L>Break every treaty, and then—smoke their pipe.</L>
<L>If by remonstrances you try to mend them,</L>
<L>Mynheer <HI>smokes on—“'tis all</HI> ad referendum.”</L>
<L>We storm upon the stage th' impassion'd breast,</L>
<L>Then come, and turn all sympathy to jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet, shall flippant mirth, and giddy joy,</L>
<L>The best impressions of the heart destroy?</L>
<L>'Tis yours, ye fair, to quell our Author's fear;</L>
<L>A Female Poet draws the tender tear.</L>
