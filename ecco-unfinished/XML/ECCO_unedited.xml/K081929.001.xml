PATENTEE OF THE
THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inscribe to You, the
writings of Mr. RICHARD SAVAGE,
an author whose early love of the
Drama, not the bitterest calamities
<PB REF="4"/>
could depress. His genius and mis∣fortunes
have heretofore gained him
the protection of a predecessor of
yours in the direction of the theatre—
Sir RICHARD STEELE, who, like
Mr. HARRIS, possessed an uncommon
share of benevolence. He acted as You
would have done: he promoted his
interest with the utmost zeal, related
his misfortunes, extolled his merit,
and took all opportunities of re∣commending
him. The unfortunate
SAVAGE, in return, would have joined
with others in acknowledging Your
worth and merit, in directing the
most rational entertainment of an
<PB REF="5"/>
enlightened people. It requires no
common exertion of spirit, activity
and abilities to be competitor for the
<HI>public favour,</HI> with a theatre directed
by the greatest dramatic genius our
country could ever boast: one assistance
You share with that Manager, the
advice of a numerous group of NEWS∣PAPER
WITS AND CRITICS, those
infallible judges of <HI>every</HI> art and
science; who, with a <HI>candour and kind∣ness</HI>
peculiar <HI>to themselves,</HI> seize every
opportunity to mark the most <HI>minute</HI>
mistake of manager and actor. If Your
feelings and doubts should make You
reject the advice of such eminent
<PB REF="6"/>
writers (who have frequently had the
greatest lawyers for their commenta∣tors)
I trust You will continue to re∣ceive,
what I know You ardently wish
—the approbation of the Public.</P>

Your obliged Friend,

LIFE

<HEAD>LIFE
OF THE
AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been observed in all ages, that the ad∣vantages
of nature or of fortune have contributed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery little to the promotion of happiness; and that
those whom the splendor of their rank, or the extent
of their capacity, have placed upon the summits of
human life▪ have not often given any just occasion
to envy in those who look up to them from a lower
station. Whether it be that apparent superiority
incites great designs, and great designs are naturally
liable to fatal miscarriages; or that the general lot
of mankind is misery, and the misfortunes of those
whose eminence drew upon them an universal atten∣tion,
have been more carefully recorded, because
they were more generally observed, and have in
reality been only more conspicuous than those of
other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not more frequent, or more severe.</P>
<P>That affluence and power, advantages extrinsic
and adventitious, and therefore easily separable from
those by whom they are possessed, should very often
flatter the mind with expectations of felicity which
they cannot give, raises no astonishment; but it
seems rational to hope, that intellectual greatness
should produce better effects; that minds qualified
for great attainments should first endeavour their
own benefit; and that they who are most able to
teach others the way to happiness, should with most
certainty follow it themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="9"/>
But this expectation, however plausible, has been
very frequently disappointed. The heroes of literary
as well as civil history have been very often no less
remarkable for what they have suffered, than for
what they have atchieved; and volume, have been
written only to enumerate the miseries of the learned,
and relate their unhappy lives, and untimely deaths.</P>
<P>To these mournful narratives, I am about to add
the Life of Richard Savage, a man whose writings
intitle him to an eminent rank in the classes of
learning, and whose misfortunes claim a degree of
compassion, not always due to the unhappy, as they
were often the consequences of the crimes of others,
rather than his own.</P>
<P>In the year 1697, Anne Countess of Macclesfield,
having lived for some time upon very uneasy terms
with her husband, thought a public confession of
adultery the most obvious and expeditious method
of obtaining her liberty; and therefore declared,
that the child, with which she was then great, was
begotten by the Earl Rivers. This, as may be easily
imagined, made her husband no less desirous of a
separation than herself, and he prosecuted his design
in the most effectual manner; for he applied not to
the ecclesiastical courts for a divorce, but to the par∣liament
for an act, by which his marriage might be
dissolved, the nuptial contract totally annulled, and
the children of his wife illegitimated. This act,
after the usual deliberation, he obtained, tho' with∣out
the approbation of some, who considered mar∣riage
as an affair only cognizable by ecclesiastical
judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year was made remarkable by the dissolution of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> in the face of the church. SALMON'S <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

</LETTER></NOTE>; and on March 3d was separated from his
<PB N="v" REF="10"/>
wife, whose fortune, which was very great, was re∣paid
her; and who having, as well as her husband,
the liberty of making another choice, was in a short
time married to Colonel Bret.</P>
<P>While the Earl of Macclesfield was prosecuting
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affair, his wife was▪ on the 10th of January
1697-8, delivered of a son, and the Earl Rivers,
by appearing to consider him as his own, left none
any reason to doubt of the sincerity of her declara∣tion;
for he was his godfather, and gave him his
own name, which was by his direction inserted in
the register of St. Andrew's parish in Holborn, but
unfortunately left him to the care of his mother,
whom, as she was now set free from her husband,
he probably imagined likely to treat with great ten∣derness
the child that had contributed to so pleasing
an event. It is not indeed easy to discover what
motives could be found to overbalance that natural
affection of a parent, or what interest could be pro∣moted
by neglect or cruelty. The dread of shame
or of poverty, by which some wretches have been
incited to abandon or to murder their children, can∣not
be supposed to have affected a woman who had
proclaimed her crimes and solicited reproach, and
on whom the clemency of the legislature had un∣deservedly
bestowed a fortune, which would have
been very little diminished by the expences which
<PB N="vi" REF="11"/>
the care of her child could have brought upon her▪
It was therefore not likely that she would be wicked
without temptation, that she would look upon her
son from his birth with a kind of resentment and
abhorrence; and instead of supporting, assisting,
and defending him, delight to see him struggling
with misery, or that she would take every oppor∣tunity
of aggravating his misfortunes, and obstruct∣ing
his resources, and with an implacable and rest∣less
cruelty continue her persecution from the first
hour of his life to the last.</P>
<P>But whatever were her motives, no sooner was
her son born, than she discovered a resolution of
disowning him; and in a very short time removed
him from her sight, by committing him to the care
of a poor woman, whom she directed to educate him
as her own, and injoined never to inform him of
his true parents.</P>
<P>Such was the beginning of the life of Richard
Savage: Born with a legal claim to honour and to
affluence, he was in two months illegitimated by
the parliament, and disowned by his mother, doomed
to poverty and obscurity, and launched upon the
ocean of life, only that he might be swallowed by
its quicksands, or d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed upon its rocks.</P>
<P>His mother could not indeed infect others with
the same cruelty. As it was impossible to avoid the
inquiries which the curiosity or tenderness of her
relations made after her child, she was obliged to
give some account of the measures that she had
taken; and her mother, the Lady Mason, whether
in approbation of her design, or to prevent more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minal contrivances, engaged to transact with the
nurse, to pay her for her care, and to superintend
the edu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on of the child.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="12"/>
In this charitable office she was assisted by his
godmother Mrs. Loyd, who, while she lived, always
looked upon him with that tenderness, which the
barbarity of his mother made peculiarly necessary;
but her death, which happened in his tenth year,
was another of the misfortunes of his childhood;
for though she kindly endeavoured to alleviate his
loss by a legacy of three hundred pounds, yet, as
he had none to prosecute his claim, to shelter him
from oppression, or call in law to the assistance of
justice, her will was eluded by the executors, and
no part of the money was ever paid.</P>
<P>He was however not yet wholly abandoned. The
Lady Mason still continued her care, and directed
him to be placed at a small grammar-school near
St. Alban's, where he was called by the name of
his nurse, without the least intimation that he had
a claim to any other.</P>
<P>Here he was initiated in literature, and passed
through several of the classes, with what rapidity
or what applause cannot now be known. As he
always spoke with respect of his master, it is pro∣bable
that the mean rank, in which he then ap∣peared,
did not hinder his genius from being distin∣guished,
or his industry from being rewarded; and
if in so low a state he obtained distinction and re∣wards,
it is not likely that they were gained but by
genius and industry.</P>
<P>It is very reasonable to conjecture, that his ap∣plication
was equal to his abilities, because his im∣provement
was more than proportioned to the op∣portunities
which he enjoyed; nor can it be doubted,
that if his earliest productions had been preserved,
like those of happier students, we might in some
have found vigorous sallies of that sprightly humour,
<PB N="viii" REF="13"/>
which distinguishes THE AUTHOR TO BE LET, and
in others, strong touches of that ardent imagination
which painted the solemn scenes of THE WAN∣DERER.</P>
<P>While he was thus cultivating his genius, his
father the Earl Rivers was seized with a distemper,
which in a short time put an end to his life. He
had frequently inquired after his son, and had always
been amused with fallacious and evasive answers;
but being now in his own opinion on his death-bed,
he thought it his duty to provide for him among his
other natural children, and therefore demanded a
positive account of him, with an importunity not
to be diverted or denied. His mother, who could
no longer refuse an answer, determined at least to
give such as should cut him off for ever from that
happiness which competence affords, and therefore
declared that he was dead; which is perhaps the first
instance of a lie invented by a mother to deprive her
son of a provision which was designed him by ano∣ther,
and which she could not expect herself, though
he should lose it.</P>
<P>This was therefore an act of wickedness which
which could not be defeated, because it could not
be suspected; the Earl did not imagine, that there
could exist in a human form a mother that would
ruin her son without enriching herself, and there∣fore
bestowed upon some other person six thousand
pounds, which he had in his will bequeathed to
Savage.</P>
<P>The same cruelty which incited his mother to
intercept this provision which had been intended
him, prompted her in a short time to another pro∣ject,
a project worthy of such a disposition. She
endeavoured to rid herself from the danger of being
<PB N="ix" REF="14"/>
at any time made known to him, by sending him
secretly to the American plantations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Savage's Preface to his Miscellany.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By whose kindness this scheme was counteracted,
or by what interposition she was induced to lay aside
her design, I know not; it is not improbable that
the Lady Mason might persuade or compel her to
desist, or perhaps she could not easily find accom∣plices
wicked enough to concur in so cruel an action;
for it may be conceived, that those who had by a
long gradation of guilt hardened their hearts against
the sense of common wickedness, would yet be
shocked at the design of a mother to expose her son
to slavery and want, to expose him without interest,
and without provocation; and Savage might on this
occasion find protectors and advocates among those
who had long traded in crimes, and whom com∣passion
had never touched before.</P>
<P>Being hindered, by whatever means, from ba∣nishing
him into another country, she formed soon
after a scheme for burying him in poverty and ob∣scurity
in his own; and that his station of life, if
not the place of his residence, might keep him for
ever at a distance from her, she ordered him to be
placed with a shoemaker in Holborn, that after the
usual time of trial, he might become his appren∣tice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Preface to Savage's Miscellanies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is generally reported, that this project was for
some time successful, and that Savage was employed
at the awl longer than he was willing to confess;
nor was it perhaps any great advantage to him, that
an unexpected discovery determined him to quit his
occupation.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="15"/>
About this time his nurse, who had always treated
him as her own son, died; and it was natural for
him to take care of those effects, which by her death
were, as he imagined, become his own; he there∣fore
went to her house, opened her boxes, and ex∣amined
her papers, among which he found some
letters written to her by the Lady Mason, which
inform'd him of his birth, and the reasons for which
it was concealed.</P>
<P>He was now no longer satisfied with the employ∣ment
which had been allotted him, but thought he
had a right to share the affluence of his mother, and
therefore without scruple applied to her as her son,
and made use of every art to awaken her tenderness,
and attract her regard. But neither his letters, nor
the interposition of those friends which his merit or
his distress procured him, made any impression upon
her mind: She still resolved to neglect, though she
could no longer disown him.</P>
<P>It was to no purpose that he frequently solicited
her to admit him to see her; she avoided him with
the most vigilant precaution, and ordered him to
be excluded from her house, by whomsoever he
might be introduced, and what reason soever he
might give for entering it.</P>
<P>Savage was at the same time so touched with the
discovery of his real mother, that it was his frequent
practice to walk in the dark evenings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLAIN DEALER, See Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndix.</NOTE> for several
hours before her door, in hopes of seeing her as she
might come by accident to the window, or cross her
apartment with a candle in her hand.</P>
<P>But all his assiduity and tenderness were without
effect, for he could neither soften her heart, nor
<PB N="xi" REF="16"/>
open her hand, and was reduced to the utmost mi∣series
of want, while he was endeavouring to awaken
the affection of a mother: He was therefore obliged
to seek some other means of support, and having
no profession, became, by necessity, an author.</P>
<P>At this time the attention of all the literary world
was engrossed by the Bangorian controversy, which
filled the press with pamphlets, and the coffee-houses
with disputants. Of this subject, as most popular,
he made choice for his first attempt, and without
any other knowledge of the question, than he had
casually collected from conversation, published a
poem against the bishop.</P>
<P>What was the success or merit of this performance
I know not; it was probably lost among the innu∣merable
pamphlets to which that dispute gave occa∣sion.
Mr. Savage was himself in a little time
ashamed of it, and endeavoured to suppress it, by
destroying all the copies that he could collect.</P>
<P>He then attempted a more gainful kind of wri∣ting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob's Lives of Dramatic Poets.</NOTE>,
and in his eighteenth year offered to the
stage a comedy borrowed from a Spanish plot, which
was refused by the players, and was therefore given
by him to Mr. Bullock, who, having more interest,
made some slight alterations, and brought it upon
the stage, under the title of<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> play was printed first in 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, and afterw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds in 12mo, the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> WOMAN'S A RIDDLE,
but allowed the unhappy author no part of the
profit.</P>
<P>Not discouraged however at his repulse, he wrote
two years afterwards LOVE IN A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>L, another
comedy, borrowed likewise from the Spanish, but
<PB N="xii" REF="17"/>
with little better success than before; for though it
was received and acted, yet it appeared so late in
the year, that the author obtained no other advan∣tage
from it, than the acquaintance of Sir Richard
Steele, and Mr. Wilks; by whom he was pitied,
caressed, and relieved.</P>
<P>Sir Richard Steele having declared in his favour
with all the ardour of benevolence which constituted
his character, promoted his interest with the utmost
zeal, related his misfortunes, applauded his merit,
took all opportunities of recommending him, and
asserted,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLAIN DEALER.</NOTE> that “the inhumanity of his mother had
given him a right to find every good man his father.”</P>
<P>Nor was Mr. Savage admitted to his acquaintance
only, but to his confidence, of which he sometimes
related an instance too extraordinary to be omitted,
as it affords a very just idea of his patron's cha∣racter.</P>
<P>He was once desired by Sir Richard, with an air
of the utmost importance, to come very early to his
house the next morning. Mr. Savage came as he
had promised, found the chariot at the door, and
Sir Richard waiting for him, and ready to go out.
What was intended, and whither they were to go,
Savage could not conjecture, and was not willing
to enquire; but immediately seated himself with
Sir Richard; the coachman was ordered to drive,
and they hurried with the utmost expedition to
Hyde-Park Corner, where they stopped at a petty
tavern, and retired to a private room. Sir Richard
then informed him, that he intended to publish a
pamphlet, and that he had desired him to come
thither that he might write for him. They soon sat
<PB N="xiii" REF="18"/>
down to the work. Sir Richard dictated, and Savage
wrote, till the dinner that had been ordered was
put upon the table. Savage was surprized at the
meanness of the entertainment, and after some he∣sitation
ventured to ask for wine, which Sir Richard,
not without reluctance, ordered to be brought.
They then finished their dinner, and proceeded in
their pamphlet, which they concluded in the after∣noon.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage then imagined his task over, and ex∣pected
that Sir Richard would call for the reckoning,
and return home; but his expectations deceived him,
for Sir Richard told him, that he was without
money, and that the pamphlet must be sold before
the dinner could be paid for; and Savage was there∣fore
obliged to go and offer their new production to
sale for two guineas, which with some difficulty he
obtained. Sir Richard then returned home, having
retired that day only to avoid his creditors, and
composed the pamphlet only to discharge his reck∣oning.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage related another fact equally uncom∣mon,
which, though it has no relation to his life,
ought to be preserved. Sir Richard Steele having
one day invited to his house a great number of per∣sons
of the first quality, they were surprised at the
number of liveries which surrounded the table; and
after dinner, when wine and mirth had set them
free from the observation of rigid ceremony, one of
them enquired of Sir Richard, how such an expen∣sive
train of domestics could be consistent with his
fortune. Sir Richard very frankly confessed, that
they were fellows of whom he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d very willingly
be rid. And being then asked, why he did not
discharge them, declared that they were b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liffs who
<PB N="xiv" REF="19"/>
had introduced themselves with an execution, and
whom, since he could not send them away, he had
thought it convenient to embellish with liveries, that
they might do him credit while they staid.</P>
<P>His friends were diverted with the expedient, and
by paying the debt discharged their attendance,
having obliged Sir Richard to promise that they
should never again find him graced with a retinue
of the same kind.</P>
<P>Under such a tutor, Mr. Savage was not likely
to learn prudence or frugality, and perhaps many
of the misfortunes which the want of those virtues
brought upon him in the following parts of his life,
might be justly imputed to so unimproving an ex∣ample.</P>
<P>Nor did the kindness of Sir Richard end in com∣mon
favours. He proposed to have established him
in some settled scheme of life, and to have con∣tracted
a kind of alliance with him, by marrying
him to a natural daughter, on whom he intended to
bestow a thousand pounds. But though he was
always lavish of future bounties, he conducted his
affairs in such a manner, that he was very seldom
able to keep his promises, or execute his own in∣tentions;
and as he was never able to raise the sum
which he had offered, the marriage was delayed.
In the mean time he was officiously informed that
Mr. Savage had ridiculed him; by which he was
so much exasperated, that he withdrew the allow∣ance
which he had paid him, and never afterwards
admitted him to his house.</P>
<P>It is not indeed unlikely that Savage might by his
imprudence expose himself to the malice of a tale∣beare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
for his patron had many follies, which as
his disc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnment easily discovered, his imagination
<PB N="xv" REF="20"/>
might sometimes incite him to mention too ludi∣crously.
A little knowledge of the world is sufficient
to discover that such weakness is very common, and
that there are few who do not sometimes, in the
wantonness of thoughtless mirth, or the heat of
transient resentment, speak of their friends and
benefactors with levity and contempt, though in
their cooler moments they want neither sense of
their kindness, nor reverence for their virtue. The
fault therefore of Mr. Savage was rather negligence
than ingratitude; but Sir Richard must likewise be
acquitted of severity, for who is there that can
patiently bear contempt from one whom he has
relieved and supported, whose establishment he has
laboured, and whose interest he has promoted?</P>
<P>He was now again abandoned to fortune, without
any other friend than than Mr. Wilks; a man,
who, whatever were his abilities or skill as an actor,
deserves at least to be remembered for his virtues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it is a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss to mankind when any good action is for∣gotten, I shall insert another instance of Mr. Wilks's generosity, very little known. Mr. Smith, a gentleman educated at Dublin, being hindered by an impediment in his pronunciation from engaging in orde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, for which his friends designed him, left his own country, and came to London in quest of employment, but found his solicitations fruitless, and his necessities every day more pressing. In this distress he wrote a tragedy, and offered it to the players, by whom it was rejected. Thus were his last hopes defeated, and he had no other prospect than of the most de∣plorable poverty. But Mr. Wilks thought his performance, though not perfect, at least worthy of some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and there∣fore off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red him a benefit. This favour he improved with so much diligence, that the house <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fforded him a considerable sum, with which he went to Leyden, applied himself to the study of physic, and prosecuted his design with so much diligence and success, that when Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was desired by the Czarina to recommend proper persons to introduce into Russia the practice and study of physic, Dr. Smith was one of those whom he selected. He had a considerable pension settled on him at his arrival, and was one of the chief physicians at the Russian court.</NOTE>,
<PB N="xvi" REF="21"/>
which are not often to be found in the world, and
perhaps less often in his profession than in others.
To be humane, generous and candid, is a very high
degree of merit in any case; but those qualities
deserve still greater praise, when they are found in
that condition, which makes almost every other man,
for whatever reason, contemptuous, insolent, petu∣lant,
selfish, and brutal.</P>
<P>As Mr. Wilks was one of those to whom calamity
seldom complained without relief, he naturally took
an unfortunate wit into his protection, and not only
assisted him in any casual distresses, but continued
an equal and steady kindness to the time of his death.</P>
<P>By his interposition Mr. Savage once obtained
from his mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I write upon the credit of the author of his life, which was published 1727.</NOTE> fifty pounds, and a promise of
one hundred and fifty more; but it was the sate of
this unhappy man, that few promises of any ad∣vantage
to him were performed. His mother was
infected among others with the general madness of
the South-Sea traffic, and having been disappointed
in her expectations, refused to pay what perhaps
nothing but the prospect of sudden affluence prompt∣ed
her to promise.</P>
<P>Being thus obliged to depend upon the friendship
of Mr. Wilks, he was consequently an assiduous
frequenter of the theatres, and in a short time the
amusements of the stage took such possession of his
mind, that he never was absent from a play in
several years.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="22"/>
This constant attendance naturally procured him
the acquaintance of the players, and among others,
of Mrs. Oldfield, who was so much pleased with
his conversation, and touched with his misfortunes,
that she allowed him a settled pension of fifty pounds
a year, which was during her life regularly paid.</P>
<P>That this act of generosity may receive its due
praise, and that the good actions of Mrs. Oldfield
may not be sullied by her general character, it is
proper to mention what Mr. Savage often declared
in the strongest terms, that he never saw her alone,
or in any other place than behind the scenes.</P>
<P>At her death he endeavoured to shew his gratitude
in the most decent manner, by wearing mourning
as for a mother, but did not celebrate her in elegies,
because he knew that too great profusion of praise
would only have revived those faults which his
natural equity did not allow him to think less,
because they were committed by one who favoured
him; but of which, though his virtue would not
endeavour to palliate them, his gratitude would not
suffer him to prolong the memory, or diffuse the
censure.</P>
<P>In his WANDERER, he has indeed taken an op∣portunity
of mentioning her, but celebrates her not
for her virtue, but her beauty, an excellence which
none ever denied her: This is the only encomium
with which he has rewarded her liberality, and per∣haps
he has even in this been too lavish of his praise.
He seems to have thought, that never to mention
his benefactress would have an appearance of ingra∣titude,
though to have dedicated any particular per∣formance
to her memory would have only betrayed
an officious partiality, that, without exalting her
character, would have depressed his own.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="23"/>
He had sometimes, by the kindness of Mr. Wilks,
the advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a benefit, on which occasions he
often received uncommon marks of regard and com∣passion;
and was once told by the Duke of Dorset,
that it was just to consider him as an injured noble∣man,
and that in his opinion the nobility ought to
think themselves obliged, without solicitation, to
take every opportunity of supporting him by their
countenance and patronage. But he had generally
the mortification to hear that the whole interest of
his mother was employed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his applications,
and that she never left any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pedient untried, by
which he might be cut off <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om the possibility of
supporting life. The same disposition she endea∣voured
to diffuse among all those over whom nature
or fortune gave her any influence, and indeed suc∣ceeded
too well in her design; but could not always
propagate her effrontery with her cruelty, for some
of those, whom she incited against him, were ashamed
of their own conduct, and boasted of that relief
which they never gave him.</P>
<P>In this censure I do not indiscriminately involve
all his relations; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, mentioned with gratitude
the humanity of one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose name I am now
unable to recollect, and to whom therefore I cannot
pay the praiseS which s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e deserves for having acted
well in opposition to influence, precept, and ex∣ample.</P>
<P>The punishment which our laws inflict upon those
parents who murder their infants is well known, nor
has its justice ever been contested; but if they de∣serve
death, who destroy a child in its birth, what
pains can be severe enough for her who forbears to
destroy him only to inflict sharper miseries upon
him; who prolong his life only to make it mi∣serable;
<PB N="xix" REF="24"/>
and who exposes him, without care and
without pity, to the malice of oppression, the ca∣prices
of chance, and the temptations of poverty;
who rejoices to see him overwhelmed with cala∣mities;
and when his own industry, or the charity
of others, has enabled him to rise for a short time
above his miseries, plunges him again into his for∣mer
distress?</P>
<P>The kindness of his friends not affording him any
constant supply, and the prospect of improving his
fortune, by enlarging his acquaintance, necessarily
leading him to places of expence, he found it ne∣cessary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>24.</NOTE>
to endeavour once more at dramatic poetry,
for which he was now better qualified by a more
extensive knowledge, and longer observation. But
having been unsuccessful in comedy, though rather
for want of opportunities than genius, he resolved
now to try whether he should not be more fortunate
in exhibiting a tragedy.</P>
<P>The story which he chose for the subject, was that
of Sir Thomas Overbury, a story well adapted to
the stage, though perhaps not far enough removed
from the present age, to admit properly the fictions
necessary to complete the plan; for the mind, which
naturally love<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truth, is always most offended with
the violation of those truths of which we are most
certain, and we of course conceive those facts most
certain, which approach nearest to our own time.</P>
<P>Out of this story he formed a tragedy, which, if
the circumstances in which he wrote it be considered,
will afford at once an uncommon proof of strength
of genius, and evenness of mind, of a serenity not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed, and an imagination not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="25"/>
During a considerable part of the time, in which
his was employed upon this performance, he was
without lodging, and often without meat; nor had
he any other conveniences for study than the fields
or the street allowed him; there he used to walk
and form his speeches, and afterwards step into a
shop, beg for a few moments the use of the pen and
ink, and write down what he had composed upon
paper, which he had picked up by accident.</P>
<P>If the performance of a writer thus distressed is
not perfect, its faults ought surely to be imputed to
a cause very different from want of genius, and
must rather excite pity than provoke censure.</P>
<P>But when under these discouragements the tragedy
was finished, there yet remained the labour of in∣troducing
it on the stage, an undertaking, which,
to an ingenuous mind, was in a very high degree
vexatious and disgusting; for having little interest
or reputation, he was obliged to submit himself
wholly to the players, and admit, with whatever
reluctance, the emendations of Mr. Cibber, which
he always considered as the disgrace of his per∣formance.</P>
<P>He had indeed in Mr. Hill another critic of a
very different class, from whose friendship he re∣received
great assistance on many occasions, and
whom he never mentioned but with the utmost ten∣derness
and regard*. He had been for some time
distinguished by him with very particular kindness,
and on this occasion it was natural to apply to him
as an author of an established character. He there∣fore
sent this tragedy to him, with a short copy of
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 181.</NOTE><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 150.</NOTE>verses, in which he desired his correction. Mr. Hill,
whose humanity and politeness are generally known
readily complied with his request; but as he is re∣markable
<PB N="xxi" REF="26"/>
for singularity of sentiment, and bold ex∣periments
in language, Mr. Savage did not think
his play much improved by his innovation, and had
even at that time the courage to reject several pas∣sages
which he could not approve; and what is still
more laudable, Mr. Hill had the generosity not to
resent the neglect of his alterations, but wrote the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 148. 186.</NOTE>prologue and epilogue, in which he touches on the
circumstances of the author with great tenderness.</P>
<P>After all these obstructions and compliances, he
was only able to bring his play upon the stage in the
summer, when the chief actors had retired, and the
rest were in possession of the house for their own
advantage. Among these, Mr. Savage was admitted
to play the part of Sir Thomas Overbury, by which
he gained no great reputation, the theatre being a
a province for which nature seemed not to have de∣signed
him; for neither his voice, look, nor gesture,
were such as are expected on the stage, and he was
himself so much ashamed of having been reduced
to appear as a player, that he always blotted out his
name from the list, when a copy of his tragedy was
to be shown to his friends.</P>
<P>In the publication of his performance he was more
successful, for the rays of genius that glimmered in
it, that glimmered through all the mists which po∣verty
and Cibber had been able to spread over it,
procured him the notice and esteem of many persons
eminent for their rank, their virtue, and their wit.</P>
<P>Of this play, acted, printed, and dedicated, the
accumulated profits arose to an hundred pounds,
which he thought at that time a very large sum,
having been never master of so much before.</P>
<P>In the Dedication<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Esq. of Herefordshire, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>, for which he received ten
<PB N="xxii" REF="27"/>
guineas, there is nothing remarkable. The Preface
contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming
excellencies of Mr. Theophilus Cibber, which Mr.
Savage could not in the latter part of his life see his
friends about to read without snatching the play out
of their hands. The generosity of Mr. Hill did
not end on this occasion; for afterwards, when Mr.
Savage's necessities returned, he encouraged a sub∣scription
to a Miscellany of Poems in a very extra∣ordinary
manner, by publishing his story in the

paper in which they were inserted, had a very pow∣erful

making her cruelty more public, they only hardened
in her aversion.</P>

particularly THE HAPPY MAN, which he published
as a specimen.</P>

should influence to patronise merit in distress, with∣out
any other solicitation, were directed to be left

seventy guineas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of those who so generously contributed to his relief, having been mentioned in a former account, ought not to be omitted here.

<PB N="xxiv" REF="29"/>
of the compassion excited by Mr. Hill's

<P>To this Miscellany he wrote a Preface<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This Preface is as follows:</P>
<P>Crudelis Mater magis, an Paer improbus ille?</P>
<P>Improbus ille Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, crudelis tu quoque Mater. VIRG.</P>
<P>My readers, I am afraid, when they observe Richard Savage joined so close, and so constantly, to “son of the late Earl Ri∣vers,” will impute to a ridiculous vanity, what is the effect of an unhappy necessity, which my hard fortune has thrown me under—I am to be pardoned for adhering a little tenaciously to my father, because my mother will allow me to be no-body; and has almost reduced me, among heavier afflictions, to that uncommon kind of want, which the Indians of America com∣plained of at our first settling among them; when they came to beg names of the English, because (said they) we are poor men of ourselves, and have none we can lay claim to.</P>
<P>The goodnature of those, to whom I have not the honour to be known, would forgive me the ludicrous turn of this be∣ginning, if they knew but how little reason I have to be merry—It was my misfortune to be son of the above-mentioned Earl, by the late Count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of Macclesfield, (now widow of Colonel Henry Bret) whose divorce, on occasion of the amour which I was a consequence of, has left something on record, which I take to be very remarkable; and it is this: Certain of our great judges, in their temporal decisions, act with a spiritual regard to Levitical Divinity, and in particular to the Ten Com∣mandments; two of which seem, in my case, to have visibly influenced their opinions—“Thou shalt not commit adultery,” pointed fullest on my mother: But, as to “The Lord's visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children,” it was considered as what could regard me only: And for that reason, I suppose, it had been inconsistent with the rules of sanctity, to assign provision out of my mother's return'd estate, for support of an infant sinner.</P>
<P>Thus, while legally the son of one Earl, and naturally of another, I am, nominal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, no-body's son at all: For the Lady having given me too much father, thought it but an equivalent deduction to leave me no mother, by way of balance—So I am sported into the world, a kind of shuttlecock, between law and nature—If law had not beaten me back, by the stroke of an act, on purpose, I had not been above wit, by the privilege of a man of quality: Nay, I might have preserved into the bar∣gain, the Lives of Duke Hamilton and Lord Mohun, whose dispute arose from the estate of that Earl of Macclesfield, whom (but for the mentioned act) I must have called father—And, if nature had not struck me off, with a stranger blow than law did, the other Earl, who was most emphatically my father, could never have been told, I was dead, when he was about to enable me, by his will, to have lived to some purpose. An unac∣countable severity of a mother! whom I was then not old enough to have deserved it from; and by which I am a single unhappy instance among that nobleman's natural children, and thrown friendless on the world without means of supporting myself, and without authority to apply to those, whose duty I know it is to supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt me.</P>
<P>Thus, however ill qualified I am to live by my wits, I have the best plea in the world for attempting it; since it is too apparent that I was born to it—Having wearied my judgment with fruitless endeavours to be happy, I gave the reins to my fancy, that I might learn, at least, to be easy.</P>
<P>But I cease a while to speak of myself, that I may say some∣thing of my Miscellany—I was furnished, by the verses of my friends, with wit enough to deserve a subscription; but I wanted another much more profitable quality, which should have em∣boldened me to solicit it (another of my wants, that, I hope, may be imputed to my mother!) I had met with little encou∣ragement, but for the endeavours of some few gentlemen in my behalf, who were generous enough to consider my ill fortune, as a merit that intitled me to their notice.</P>
<P>Among these I am particularly indebted to the author of the PLAIN DEALERS, who was pleased, in two of his papers (which I intreat his pardon for reprinting before my Miscellany) to point out my unhappy story to the world with so touching a humanity, and so good an effect, that many persons of quality, of all ranks, and of both sexes, distinguished themselves with the promptness he had hinted to the noble-minded; and not staying till they were applied to, sent me the honour of their subscriptions in the most liberal and handsome manner for en∣couragement of my undertaking.</P>
<P>I ought here to acknowledge several savours from Mr. Hill, whose writings are a shining ornament of this Miscellany; but I wave detaining my readers, and beg leave to refer them to a copy of verses called THE FRIEND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 181.</NOTE>, which I have taken the the liberty to address to that gentleman.</P>
<P>To return to the Lady, my mother—Had the celebrated Mr. Locke been acquainted with her example, it had certainly ap∣peared in his chapter against innate practical principles; because it would have completed his instances of enor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities: Some of which, though not exactly in the order that he mentions them, are as follow—“Have there not been (s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys he) whole nations, and those of the most civilized people, amongst whom, the exposing their children to perish by want, or wild beasts, has been a practice as little condemned or scrupled as the begetting them?” Were I inclinable to be serious, I could easily prove that I have not been more gently dealt with by Mrs. Bret; but if this is any way foreign to my case, I shall find a nearer ex∣ample in the whimsical one that ensues.</P>
<P>“It is familiar (says the afore-cited author) among the Men∣grelians, a people professing Christianity, to bury their children alive without scruple”—There are indeed sundry sects of Chri∣stians, and I have often wondered which could be my mamma's, but now I find she piously professes and practises Christianity after the manner of the Mengrelians; she industriously obscured me, when my fortune depended on my being known, and, in that sense, she may be said to have buried me alive; and sure, like a Mengrelian, she must have committed the acti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n without s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruple; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she is a woman of spirit, and can see the conse∣quence without remorse—“The Cari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s (continu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my author) were wont to castrate their child<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, in order to f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and eat them”—Here indeed I can draw no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rallel; for to speak justice of the Lady, she never contributed ought to have me pampered, but always promoted my being starved: Nor did she, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in my infancy, betray fondness enough to be suspected of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> design to devour me; but, on the contrary, not enduring me ever to ap∣proach her, offered a bribe to have me shipped off, in an odd manner, to one of the plantations—When I was about fifteen her affection began to awake, and had I but known my interest, I had been handsomely provided for. In short, I was solicited to be bound apprentice to a very honest and reputable occu∣pation—a shoemaker; an offer which I undutifully rejected. I was, in fine, unwilling to understand her in a literal sense, and hoped, that, like the prophets of old, she might have hinted her mind in a kind of parable, or proverbial way of speaking; as thus—That one time or other I might, on due application, have the honour of taking the length of her foot.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke mentions another set of people that dispatch their children, if a pretended astrologer declares them to have un∣happy stars—Perhaps my mamma has procured some cunning man to calculate my nativity; or having had some ominous d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eam, which preceded my birth, the dire event may have ap∣peared to her in the dark and dreary bottom of a China cup, where coffee-stains are often consulted for prophecies, and held as infallible as were the leaves of the ancient Sybils—To be partly serious: I am rather willing to wrong her judgment, by suspecting it to be tainted a little with the tenets of superstition, than suppose she can be mistress of a seared conscience, and act on no principle at all.</P></NOTE>, in which

The same observation may be extended to
all his Dedications: his compliments are constrained
and violent, heaped together without the grace of

order, or the decency of introduction: he seems to
have written his Panegyrics for the perusal only of
his patrons, and to have imagined that he had no
other task than to pamper them with praises however
g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss, and that flattery would make its way to the
heart, without the assistance of elegance or inven∣tion.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards the death of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing furnished
a general subject for a poetical contest, in which
Mr. Savage engaged, and is allowed to have carried
the prize of honour from his competitors; but I
know not whether he gained by his performance any
other advantage than the increase of his reputation;
though it must certainly have been with farther
views that he prevailed upon himself to attempt a
species of writing, of which all the topics had been
long before exhausted, and which was made at once
difficult by the multitudes that had failed in it, and
those that had succeeded.</P>
<P>He was now advancing in reputation, and though
frequently involved in very distressful perplexities,
appeared however to be gaining upon mankind,
when both his fame and his life were endangered by
an event, of which it is not yet determined, whe∣ther
it ought to be mentioned as a crime or a cala∣mity.</P>
<P>On the 20th of November 1727, Mr. Savage
came from Richmond, where he then lodged, that
he might pursue his studies with less interruption,
with an intent to discharge another lodging which
he had in Westminster, and accidentally meeting
two gentlemen his acquaintances, whose names were
Merchant and Gregory, he went in with them to
a neighbouring coffee-house, and sat drinking till
it was late, it being in no time of Mr. Savage's life
<PB N="xxix" REF="34"/>
any part of his character to be the first of the com∣pany
that desired to separate. He would willingly
have gone to bed in the same house, but there was
not room for the whole company, and therefore they
agreed to ramble about the streets, and divert them∣selves
with such amusements as should offer them∣selves
till morning.</P>
<P>In their walk they happened unluckily to discover
light in Robinson's coffee-house near Charing-cross,
and therefore went in. Merchant, with some rude∣ness,
demanded a room, and was told that there was
a good fire in the next parlour, which the company
were about to leave, being then paying their reck∣oning.
Merchant, not satisfied with this answer,
rushed into the room, and was followed by his com∣panions.
He then petulantly placed himself be∣tween
the company and the fire, and soon after
kicked down the table. This produced a quarrel,
swords were drawn on both sides, and one Mr. James
Sinclair was killed. Savage having wounded like∣wise
a maid that held him, forced his way with
Merchant out of the house; but being intimidated
and confused, without resolution either to fly or stay,
they were taken in a back court by one of the com∣pany
and some soldiers, whom he had called to his
assistance.</P>
<P>Being secured and guarded that night, they were
in the morning carried before three justices, who
committed them to the Gatehouse, from whence,
upon the death of Mr. Sinclair, which happened
the same day, they were removed in the night to
Newgate, where they were however treated with
some distinction, exempted from the ignominy of
chains, and confined, not among the common cri∣minals,

When the day of trial came, the court was
crouded in a very unusual manner, and the public
appeared to interest itself as in a cause of general
concern. The witnesses against Mr. Savage and his
friends were, the woman who kept the house, which
was a house of ill same, and her maid, the men
who were in the room with Mr. Sinclair, and a
woman of the town, who had been drinking with
them, and with whom one of them had been seen
in bed. They swore in general, that Merchant gave
the provocation, which Savage and Gregory drew
their swords to justify; that Savage drew first, and
that he stabbed Sinclair when he was not in a posture
of defence, or while Gregory commanded his sword;
that after he had given the thrust he turned pale,
and would have retired, but that the maid clung
round him, and one of the company endeavoured
to detain him, from whom he broke, by cutting the
maid on the head, but was afterwards taken in a
court.</P>
<P>There was some difference in their depositions:
one did not see Savage give the wound, another
saw it given when Sinclair held his point towards
the ground; and the woman of the town asserted,
that she did not see Sinclair's sword at all: This
difference however was very far from amounting to
inconsistency, but it was sufficient to shew, that the
hurry of the dispute was such, that it was not easy
to discover the truth with relation to particular cir∣cumstances,
and that therefore some deductions were
to be made from the credibility of the testimonies.</P>
<P>Sinclair had declared several times before his
death, that he received his wound from Savage, nor
did Savage at his trial deny the fact, but endea∣voured
partly to extenuate it, by urging the sud∣denness
<PB N="xxxi" REF="36"/>
of the whole action, and the impossibility
of any ill design, or premeditated malice, and partly
to justify it by the necessity of self-defence, and the
hazard of his own life, if he had lost that oppor∣tunity
of giving the thrust: He observed, that nei∣ther
reason nor law obliged a man to wait for the
blow which was threatened, and which, if he should
suffer it, he might never be able to return; that it
was always allowable to prevent an assault, and to
preserve life by taking away that of the adversary,
by whom it was endangered.</P>
<P>With regard to the violence with which he en∣deavoured
to escape, he declared, that it was not
his design to fly from justice, or decline a trial, but
to avoid the expences and severities of a prison, and
that he intended to have appeared at the bar without
compulsion.</P>
<P>This defence, which took up more than an hour,
was heard by the multitude that thronged the court
with the most attentive and respectful silence: Those
who thought he ought not to be acquitted, owned
that applause could not be refused him; and those
who before pitied his misfortunes, now reverenced
his abilities.</P>
<P>The witnesses which appeared against him were
proved to be persons of characters which did not
entitle them to much credit; a common strumpet,
a woman by whom strumpets were entertained, and
a man by whom they were supported; and the cha∣racter
of Savage was by several persons of distinction
asserted to be that of a modest inoffensive man, not
inclined to broils, or to insolence, and who had, to
that time, been only known for his misfortunes and
his wit.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="37"/>
Had his audience been his judges, he had un∣doubtedly
been acquitted; but Mr. Page, who was
then upon the bench, treated him with his usual
insolence and severity, and when he had summed up
the evidence, endeavoured to exasperate the jury,
as Mr. Savage used to relate it, with this eloquent
harangue.</P>
<P>“Gentlemen of the jury, you are to consider that
Mr. Savage is a very great man, a much greater
man than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that
he wears very fine clothes, much finer clothes than
you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he has
abundance of money in his pocket, much more
money than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; but,
gentlemen of the jury, is it not a very hard case,
gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Savage should
therefore kill you or me, gentlemen of the jury?”</P>
<P>Mr. Savage hearing his defence thus misrepre∣sented,
and the men who were to decide his fate
incited against him by invidious comparisons, reso∣lutely
asserted, that his cause was not candidly ex∣plained,
and began to recapitulate what he had
before said with regard to his condition, and the
necessity of endeavouring to escape the expences of
imprisonment; but the judge having ordered him to
be silent, and repeated his orders without effect,
commanded that he should be taken from the bar
by force.</P>
<P>The jury then heard the opinion of the judge,
that good characters were of no weight against po∣sitive
evidence, though they might turn the scale,
where it was doubtful; and that though, when two
men attack each other, the death of either is only
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="38"/>
manslaughter; but where one is the aggressor, as in
the case before them, and in pursuance of his first
attack, kills the other, the law supposes the action,
however sudden, to be malicious. They then de∣liberated
upon their verdict, and determined that
Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were guilty of murder,
and Mr. Merchant, who had no sword, only of
manslaughter.</P>
<P>Thus ended this memorable trial, which lasted
eight hours. Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were
conducted back to prison, where they were more
closely confined, and loaded with irons of fifty
pounds weight: Four days afterwards they were sent
back to the court to receive sentence; on which
occasion Mr. Savage made, as far as it could be
retained in memory, the following speech.</P>
<P>“It is now, my Lord, too late to offer any thing
by way of defence or vindication; nor can we
expect ought from your Lordships, in this court,
but the sentence which the law requires you, as
judges, to pronounce against men of our calamitous
condition.—But we are also persuaded, that as
mere men, and out of this seat of rigorous justice,
you are susceptive of the tender passions, and too
humane, not to commiserate the unhappy situation
of those, whom the law sometimes perhaps—exacts
—from you to pronounce upon. No doubt you
distinguish between offences, which arise out of
premeditation, and a disposition habituated to vice
or immorality, and transgressions, which are the
unhappy and unforeseen effects of casual absence
of reason, and sudden impulse of passion: We
therefore hope you will contribute all you can to
an extension of that mercy, which the gentlemen
of the jury have been pleased to shew Mr. Mer∣chant,
who (allowing facts as sworn against us by
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="39"/>
the evidence) has led us into this our calamity.
I hope this will not be construed, as if we meant
to reflect upon that gentleman, or remove any
thing from us upon him, or that we repine the
more at our fate, because he has no participation
of it: No, my Lord! For my part, I declare
nothing could more soften my grief, than to be
without any companion in so great a misfortune<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Mr. Savage had now no hopes of life, but from
the mercy of the crown, which was very earnestly
solicited by his friends, and which, with whatever
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iculty the story may obtain belief, was obstructed
only by his mother.</P>
<P>To prejudice the Queen against him, she made
use of an incident, which was omitted in the order
of time, that it might be mentioned together with
the purpose which it was made to serve. Mr. Savage,
when he had disco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered his birth, had an inc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssant
desire to speak to his mother, who always avoided
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in public, and refused him admission into her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. One evening walking, as it was his custom,
in the street that she inhabited, he saw the door of
her house by accident open; he entered it, and
finding no persons in the passage to hinder him,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt up stairs to salute her. She discovered him
before he could enter her chamber, alarmed the
family with the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distressful outcries, and when
she had by her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gathered them about her,
ordered them to drive out of the house that villain,
who had forced himself in upon her, and endea∣voured
to murder her. Savage, who had attempted
with the most submissive tenderness to soften her
rage, hearing her utter so detestable an accusation,
<PB N="xxxv" REF="40"/>
thought it prudent to retire, and, I believe, never
attempted afterwards to speak to her.</P>
<P>But shocked as he was with her falshood and her
cruelty, he imagined that she intended no other use
of her lie, than to let herself free from his em∣braces
and solicitations, and was very far from sus∣pecting
that she would treasure it in her memory,
as an instrument of future wickedness, or that she
would endeavour for this fictitious assault to deprive
him of his life.</P>
<P>But when the Queen was solicited for his pardon,
and informed of the severe treatments which he had
suffered from his judge, she answered, that however
unjustifiable might be the manner of his trial, or
whatever extenuation the action for which he was
condemned might admit, she could not think that
man a proper object of the King's mercy, who had
been capable of entering his mother's house in the
night, with an intent to murder her.</P>
<P>By whom this atrocious calumny had been trans∣mitted
to the Queen; whether she that invented had
the front to relate it; whether she found any one
weak enough to credit it, or corrupt enough to con∣cur
with her in her hateful design, I know not; but
methods had been taken to persuade the Queen so
strongly of the truth of it, that she for a long time
refused to hear any of those who petitioned for his
life.</P>
<P>Thus had Savage perished by the evidence of a
bawd, a strumpet, and his mother, had not justice
and compassion procured him an advocate of rank
too great to be rejected unheard, and of virtue too
eminent to be heard without being believed. His
merit and his calamities happened to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h the ear
of the Countess of Hertford, who engaged in his
support with all the tenderness that is excised by
pity, and all the zeal which is kindled by generosity,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="41"/>
and demanding an audience of the Queen, laid
before her the whole series of his mother's cruelty,
exposed the improbability of an accusation by which
he was charged with an intent to commit a murder,
that could produce no advantage, and soon con∣vinced
her how little his former conduct could de∣serve
to be mentioned as a reason for extraordinary
severity.</P>
<P>The interposition of this Lady was so successful,
that he was soon after admitted to bail, and on the
9th of March 1728, pleaded the King's pardon.</P>
<P>It is natural to enquire upon what motives his
mother could persecute him in a manner so outra∣geous
and implacable; for what reason she could
employ all the acts of malice, and all the snares of
calumny, to take away the life of her own son, of
a son who never injured her, who was never sup∣ported
by her expence, nor obstructed any prospect
of pleasure or advantage; why she should endeavour
to destroy him by a lie; a lie which could not gain
credit, but must vanish of itself at the first moment
of examination, and of which only this can be said
to make it probable, that it may be observed from
her conduct, that the most execrable crimes are
sometimes committed without apparent temptation.</P>
<P>This mother is still alive, and may perhaps even
yet, though her malice was so often defeated, enjoy
the pleasure of reflecting, that the life which she
often endeavoured to destroy, was at least shortened
by her maternal offices; that though she could not
transport her son to the plantations, bury him in the
shop of a mechanic, or hasten the hand of the public
executioner, she has yet had the satisfaction of im∣bittering
all his hours, and forcing him into exi∣gencies,
that hurried on his death.</P>
<P>It is by no means necessary to aggravate the enor∣mity
of this woman's conduct, by placing it in op∣position
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="42"/>
to that of the Countess of Hertford; no
one can fail to observe how much more amiable it is
to relieve, than to oppress, and to rescue innocence
from destruction, than to destroy without an▪ injury.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, during his imprisonment, his trial,
and the time in which he lay under sentence of
death, behaved with great firmness and equality of
mind, and confirmed by his fortitude the esteem of
those, who before admired him for his abilities.
The peculiar circumstances of his life were made
more generally known by a short account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Written by Mr. Beckingham and another gentleman.</NOTE>, which
was then published, and of which several thousands
were in a few weeks dispersed over the nation; and
the compassion of mankind operated so powerfully
in his favour, that he was enabled, by frequent
presents, not only to support himself, but to assist
Mr. Gregory in prison; and when he was pardoned
and released, he found the number of his friends
not lessened.</P>
<P>The nature of the act for which he had been
tried was in itself doubtful; of the evidences which
appeared against him, the character of the man was
not unexceptionable, that of the women notoriously
infamous: she whose testimony chiefly influenced the
jury to condemn him, afterwards retracted her as∣sertions.
He always himself denied that he was
drunk, as had been generally reported. Mr. Gre∣gory,
who is now Collector of Antegua, is said to
declare him sar less criminal than he was imagined,
even by some who savoured him: And Page himself
afterwards confessed, that he had treated him with
uncommon rigour. When all these particulars are
rated together, perhaps the memory of Savage may
not be much sullied by his trial.</P>
<P>Some time after he had obtained his liberty, he
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="43"/>
met in the street the woman that had sworn with so
much malignity against him. She informed him,
that she was in distress, and, with a degree of con∣fidence
not easily attainable, desired him to relieve
her. He, instead of insulting her misery, and
taking pleasure in the calamities of one who had
brought his life into danger, reproved her gently
for her perjury, and changing the only guinea that
he had, divided it equally between her and himself.</P>
<P>This is an action which in some ages would have
made a saint, and perhaps in others a hero, and
which, without any hyperbolical encomiums, must
be allowed to be an instance of uncommon gene∣rosity,
an act of complicated virtue; by which he
at once relieved the poor, corrected the vicious, and
forgave an enemy; by which he at once remitted
the strongest provocations, and exercised the most
ardent charity.</P>
<P>Compassion was indeed the distinguishing quality
of Savage; he never appeared inclined to take ad∣vantage
of weakness, to attack the defenceless, or
to press upon the falling: whoever was distressed was
certain at least of his good wishes; and when he
could give no assistance, to extricate them from mis∣fortunes,
he endeavoured to sooth them by sympathy
and tenderness.</P>
<P>But when his heart was not softened by the sight
of misery, he was sometimes obstinate in his resent∣ment,
and did not quickly lose the remembrance of
an injury. He always continued to speak with anger
of the insolence and partiality of Page, and a short
time before his death revenged it by a satire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is natural to enquire in what terms Mr. Savage
spoke of this fatal action, when the danger was over,
and he was under no necessity of using any art to
set his conduct in the fairest light. He was not
<PB N="xxxix" REF="44"/>
willing to dwell upon it, and if he transiently men∣tioned
it, appeared neither to consider himself as a
murderer, nor as a man wholly free from the guilt
of blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of his letters he stiles it “a fatal quarrel, but too well known.”</NOTE>. How much and how long he regretted
it, appeared in a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 93.</NOTE> poem which he published many
years afterwards. On occasion of a copy of verses,
in which the failings of good men were recounted,
and in which the author had endeavoured to illustrate
his position, that “the best may sometimes deviate
from virtue,” by an instance of murder committed
by Savage in the heat of wine, Savage remarked,
that it was no very just representation of a good man,
to suppose him liable to drunkenness, and disposed
in his riots to cut throats.</P>
<P>He was now indeed at liberty, but was, as before,
without any other support than accidental favours
and uncertain patronage afforded him; sources by
which he was sometimes very liberally supplied, and
which at other times were suddenly stopped; so
that he spent his life between want and plenty, or,
what was yet worse, between beggary and extra∣vagance;
for as whatever he received was the gift
of chance, which might as well favour him at one
time as another, he was tempted to squander what
he had, because he always hoped to be immediately
supplied.</P>
<P>Another cause of his profusion was the absurd
kindness of his friends, who at once rewarded and
enjoyed his abilities, by treating him at taverns,
and habituated him to pleasures which he could not
afford to enjoy, and which he was not able to deny
himself, though he purchased the luxury of a single
night by the anguish of cold and hunger for a week.</P>
<P>The experience of these inconveniences deter∣mined
him to endeavour after some settled income,
<PB N="xl" REF="45"/>
which, having long found submission and intreaties
fruitless, he attempted to extort from his mother by
rougher methods. He had now, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he acknow∣ledged,
lost that tenderness for her, which the whole
series of her cruelty had not been able wholly to
repress, till he found, by the efforts which she made
for his destruction, that she was not content with
refusing to assist him, and being neutial in his
struggles with poverty, but was as ready to snatch
every opportunity of adding to his misfortunes, and
that she was to be considered as an enemy implacably
malicious, whom nothing but his blood could sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy.
He therefore threatened to harass her with lampoon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and to publish a copious narrative of her conduct,
unless she consented to purchase an exemption from
infamy, by allowing him a pension.</P>
<P>This expedient proved successful. Whether shame
still survived, though virtue was extinct, or whether
her relations had more delicacy than herself, and
imagined that some of the darts which fatire might
point at her would glance upon them: Lord Tyr∣connel,
whatever were his motives, upon his promise
to lay aside his design of exposing the cruelty of his
mother, received him into his family, treated him
as his equal, and engaged to allow him a pension of
two hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This was the golden part of Mr. Savage's life;
and for some time he had no reason to complain of
fortune; his appearance was splendid, his expences
large, and his acquaintance extensive. He was
courted by all who endeavoured to be thought men
of genius, and caressed by all who valued themselves
upon a refined taste. To admire Mr. Savage was
a proof of discernment, and to be acquainted with
him was a title to poetical reputation. His presence
was sufficient to make any place of public enter∣tainment
popular; and his approbation and example
<PB N="xli" REF="46"/>
constituted the fashion. So powerful is genius, when
it is invested with the glitter of affluence! Men wil∣lingly
pay to fortune that regard which they owe to
merit, and are pleased when they have an oppor∣tunity
at once of gratifying their vanity, and prac∣tising
their duty.</P>
<P>This interval of prosperity furnished him with
opportunities of enlarging his knowledge of human
nature, by contemplating life from its highest gra∣dations
to its lowest, and had he afterwards applied
to dramatic poetry, he would perhaps not have had
many superiors; for as he never suffered any scene
to pass before his eyes without notice, he had trea∣sured
in his mind all the different combinations of
passions, and the innumerable mixtures of vice and
virtue, which distinguish one character from another;
and as his conception was strong, his expressions were
clear, he easily received impressions from objects,
and very forcibly transmitted them to others.</P>
<P>Of his exact observations on human life he has
left a proof, which would do honour to the greatest
names, in a small pamphlet, called, THE AUTHOR
TO BE LET<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 231.</NOTE>, where he introduces Iscariot Hackney,
a prostitute scribbler, giving an account of his birth,
his education, his disposition and morals, habits of
life, and maxims of conduct. In the introduction
are related many secret histories of the petty writers
of that time, but sometimes mixed with ungenerous
reflections on their birth, their circumstances, or
those of their relations; nor can it be denied, that
some passages are such as Iscariot Hackney might
himself have produced.</P>
<P>He was accused likewise of living in an appear∣ance
of friendship with some whom he satirised, and
of making use of the confidence which he gained by
a seeming kindness to discover failings and expose
them: it must be confessed, that Mr. Savage's esteem
<PB N="xlii" REF="47"/>
was no very certain possession, and that he would
lampoon at one time those whom he had praised at
another.</P>
<P>It may be alleged, that the same man may change
his principles, and that he who was once deservedly
commended, may be afterwards satirised with equal
justice, or that the poet was dazzled with the ap∣pearance
of virtue, and found the man whom he had
celebrated, when he had an opportunity of examin∣ing
him more nearly, unworthy of the panegyric
which he had too hastily bestowed; and that as a
false satire ought to be recanted, for the sake of him
whose reputation may be injured, false praise ought
likewise to be obviated, lest the distinction between
vice and virtue should be lost, left a bad man should
be trusted upon the credit of his encomiast, or left
others should endeavour to obtain the like praises by
the same means.</P>
<P>But though these excuses may be often plausible,
and sometimes just, they are very seldom satisfactory
to mankind; and the writer, who is not constant to
his subject, quickly sinks into contempt, his satire
loses its force, and his panegyric its value, and he is
only considered at one time as a flatterer, and as a
calumniator at another.</P>
<P>To avoid these imputations, it is only necessary to
follow the rules of virtue, and to preserve an unva∣ried
regard to truth. For though it is undoubtedly
possible, that a man, however cautious, may be some∣times
deceived by an artful appearance of virtue, or
by false evidences of guilt, such errors will not be
frequent; and it will be allowed, that the name of
an author would never have been made contemptible,
had no man ever said what he did not think, or mis∣led
others, but when he was himself deceived.</P>
<P>If THE AUTHOR TO BE LET was first published in a
single pamphlet, and afterwards inserted in a collec∣tion
<PB N="xliii" REF="48"/>
of pieces relating to the Dunciad, which were ad∣dressed
by Mr. Savage to the Earl of Middlesex, in a
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>dedication which he was prevailed upon to sign, tho'
he did not write it, and in which there are some posi∣tions,
that the true author would perhaps not have
published under his own name, and on which Mr.
Savage afterwards reflected with no great satisfaction;
the enumeration of the bad effects of the uncon∣trolled
freedom of the press, and the assertion that
the “Liberties taken by the writers of Journals with
▪their superiors were exorbitant and unjustifiable,”
very ill became men, who have themselves not al∣ways
shewn the exactest regard to the laws of subor∣dination
in their writing, and who have often sati∣rised
those that at least thought themselves their su∣periors,
as they were eminent for their hereditary
rank, and employed in the highest offices of the king∣dom.
But this is only an instance of that partiality
which almost every man indulges with regard to him∣self;
the liberty of the press is a blessing when we
are inclined to write against others, and a calamity
when we find ourselves overborn by the multitude of
our assailants; as the power of the crown is always
thought too great by those who suffer by its influ∣ence,
and too little by those in whose favour it is
exerted; and a standing army is generally accounted
necessary by those who command, and dangerous
and oppressive by those who support it.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage was likewise very far from believing,
that the letters annexed to each species of bad poets
in the Bathos, were, as he was directed to assert,
“set down at random;” for when he was charged by
one of his friends with putting his name to such an
improbability, he had no other answer to make, than
that “he did not think of it,” and his friend had too
much tenderness to reply, that next to the crime of
<PB N="xliv" REF="49"/>
writing contrary to what he thought, was that of
writing without thinking.</P>
<P>After having remarked what is false in this dedi∣cation,
it is proper that I observe the impartiality
which I recommend, by declaring what Savage as∣serted,
that the account of the circumstances which
attended the publication of the Dunciad, however
strange and improbable, was exactly true.</P>
<P>The publication of this piece at this time raised
Mr. Savage a great number of enemies among those
that were attacked by Mr. Pope, with whom he was
considered as a kind of confederate, and whom he
was suspected of supplying with private intelligence
and secret incidents: so that the ignominy of an in∣former
was added to the te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or of a satirist.</P>
<P>That he was not altogether free from literary
hypocrisy, and that he sometimes spoke one thing,
and wrote another, cannot be denied; because he
himself confessed, that when he lived in great fami∣liarity
with Dennis, he wrote an epigram<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This epigram was, I believe, never published.</P>
<LG>
<L>Should Dennis publish you had stabb'd your brother,</L>
<L>Lampoon'd your monarch, or debauch'd your mother;</L>
<L>Say what revenge on Dennis can be had,</L>
<L>Too dull for laughter, for reply too mad?</L>
<L>On one so poor you cannot take the law,</L>
<L>On one so old your sword you scorn to draw:</L>
<L>Uncag'd, then, let the harmless monster race,</L>
<L>Secure in dulness, madness, want, and age.</L>
</LG></NOTE> against
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however set all the malice of all the
pigmy writers at defiance, and thought the friend∣ship
of Mr. Pope cheaply purchased by being ex∣posed
to their censure and their hatred; nor had he
any reason to repent of the preference, for he found
Mr. Pope a steady and unalienable friend almost to
the end of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="xlv" REF="50"/>
About this time, notwithstanding his avowed neu∣trality
with regard to party, he published a panegyric
on Sir Robert Walpole, for which he was rewarded
by him with twenty guineas, a sum not very large,
if either the excellence of the performance, or the
affluence of the patron be considered; but greater
than he afterwards obtained from a person of yet
higher rank, and more desirous in appearance of be∣ing
distinguished as a patron of literature.</P>
<P>As he was very far from approving the conduct of
Sir Robert Walpole, and in conversation mentioned
him sometimes with acrimony, and generally with
contempt; as he was one of those who were always
zealous in their assertions of the justice of the late
opposition, jealous of the rights of the people, and
alarmed by the long-continued triumph of the court;
it was natural to ask him what could induce him to
employ his poetry in praise of that man who was, in
his opinion, an enemy to liberty, and an oppressor
of his country? He alleged, that he was then de∣pendent
upon the Lord Tyrconnel, who was an im∣plicit
follower of the ministry, and that being en∣joined
by him, not without menaces, to write in
praise of his leader, he had not resolution sufficient
to sacrifice the pleasure of affluence to that of in∣tegrity.</P>
<P>On this, and on many other occasions, he was
ready to lament the misery of living at the tables of
other men, which was his fate from the beginning
to the end of his life; for I know not whether he
ever had, for three months together, a settled habi∣tation,
in which he could claim a right of residence.</P>
<P>To this unhappy state it is just to impute much of
the inconstancy of his conduct; for though a readi∣ness
to comply with the inclination of others was no
part of his natural character, yet he was sometimes
obliged to relax his obstinacy, and submit his own
<PB N="xlvi" REF="51"/>
judgment and even his virtue to the government of
those by whom he was supported: so that if his mi∣series
were sometimes the consequences of his faults,
he ought not yet to be wholly excluded from com∣passion,
because his faults were very often the effects
of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>In this gay period<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1729.</NOTE> of his life, while he was sur∣rounded
by affluence and pleasure, he published THE
WANDERER, a moral Poem, of which the design is
comprised in these lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>I fly all public care, all venal strife,</L>
<L>To try the still, compar'd with active life;</L>
<L>To prove, by these the sons of men may owe</L>
<L>The fruits of bliss to bursting clouds of woe;</L>
<L>That e'en calamity, by thought refin'd,</L>
<L>Inspirits and adorns the thanking mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>And more distinctly in the following passage:</P>
<LG>
<L>By woe, the soul to daring action swells;</L>
<L>By woe, in plaintless patience it excels;</L>
<L>From patience, prudent clear experience springs,</L>
<L>And traces knowledge thro' the course of things!</L>
<L>Thence hope is form'd, thence fortitude, success,</L>
<L>Renown:—whate'er men covet and caress.</L>
</LG>
<P>This performance was always considered by him∣self
as his master-piece; and Mr. Pope, when he
asked his opinion of it, told him, that he read it
once over, and was not displeased with it, that it
gave him more pleasure at the second perusal, and
delighted him still more at the third.</P>
<P>It has been generally objected to THE WANDERER,
that the disposition of the parts is irregular, that the
design is obscure, and the plan perplexed; that the
<PB N="xlvii" REF="52"/>
images, however beautiful, succeed each other with∣out
order; and that the whole performance is not so
much a regular fabric, as a heap of shining mate∣rials
thrown together by accident, which strikes
rather with the solemn magnificence of a stupendous
ruin, than the elegant grandeur of a finished pile.</P>
<P>This criticism is universal, and therefore it is
reasonable to believe it at least in a great degree
just; but Mr. Savage was always of a contrary
opinion, and thought his drift could only be missed
by negligence or stupidity, and that the whole plan
was regular, and the parts distinct.</P>
<P>It was never denied to abound with strong repre∣sentations
of nature, and just observations upon life,
and it may easily be observed, that most of his pic∣tures
have an evident tendency to illustrate his first
great position, “that good is the consequence of
evil.” The sun that burns up the mountains,
fructifies the vales; the deluge that rushes down the
broken rocks with dreadful impetuosity, is separated
into purling brooks; and the rage of the hurricane
purifies the air.</P>
<P>Even in this poem he has not been able to forbear
one touch upon the cruelty of his mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>, which,
though remarkably delicate and tender, is a proof
how deep an impression it had upon his mind.</P>
<P>This must be at least acknowledged, which ought
to be thought equivalent to many other excellencies,
that this poem can promote no other purposes than
those of virtue, and that it is written with a very
strong sense of the efficacy of religion.</P>
<P>But my province is rather to give the history of
Mr. Savage's performances, than to display their
beauties, or to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te the criticisms which they
have occasioned, and therefore I shall not dwell upon
<PB N="xlviii" REF="53"/>
the particular passages which deserve applause: I
shall neither show the excellence of his descriptions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 59.</NOTE>,
nor expatiate on the terrific portrait of suicide<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>,
nor point out the artful touches<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Ibid. p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, by whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has
distinguished the intellectual features of the rebels,
who suffer death in his last canto. It is, however,
proper to observe, that Mr. Savage always declared
the characters wholly fictitious, and without the least
allusion to any real persons or actions.</P>
<P>From a poem so diligently laboured, and so suc∣cessfully
finished, it might be reasonably expected
that he should have gained considerable advantage;
nor can it, without some degree of indignation and
concern, be told, that he sold the copy for ten gui∣neas,
of which he afterwards returned two, that the
two last sheets of the work might be reprinted, of
which he had in his absence intrusted the correction
to a friend, who was too indolent to perform it with
accuracy.</P>
<P>A superstitious regard to the correction of his
sheets was one of Mr. Savage's peculiarities: he
often altered, revised, recurred to his first reading
or punctuation, and again adopted the alteration;
he was dubious and irresolute without end, as on
a question of the last importance, and at last was
seldom satisfied: the intrusion or omission of a com∣ma
was sufficient to discompose him, and he would
lament an error of a single letter as a heavy cala∣mity.
In one of his letter relating to an impression
of some verses, he remarks, that he had, with regard
to the correction of the proof. “a spell upon him;”
and indeed the anxiety, with which he dwelt upon
the minutest and most trifling nicetie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, deserved no
other name than that of fasci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation.</P>
<P>That he sold so valuable a performance for so
small a price was not to be imputed either to neces∣sity,
<PB N="xlix" REF="54"/>
by which the learned and ingenious are often
obliged to submit to very hard conditions, or to
avarice, by which the booksellers are frequently in∣cited
to oppress that genius by which they are sup∣ported,
but to that intemperate desire of pleasure,
and habitual slavery to his passions, which involved
him in many perplexities; he happened at that time
to be engaged in the pursuit of some trifling grati∣fication,
and being without money for the present
occasion, sold his poem to the first bidder, and per∣h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the first price that was proposed, and would
probably have been content with less, if less had
been offered him.</P>
<P>This poem was addressed to the Lord Tyrconnel
not only in the first lines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 7.</NOTE>, but in a formal dedication
filled with the highest strains of panegyric, and the
war<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nest professions of gratitude, but by no means
remarkable for delicacy of connection or elegance of
stile.</P>
<P>These praises in a short time he found himself
inclined to retract, being discarded by the man on
whom he had bestowed them, and whom he then
immediately discovered not to have deserved them.
Of this quarrel, which every day made more bitter,
Lord Tyrconnel and Mr. Savage assigned very dif∣ferent
reasons, which might perhaps all in reality
concur, though they were not all convenient to be
alleged by either party. Lord Tyrconnel affirmed,
that it was the constant practice of Mr. Savage to
enter a tavern with any company that proposed it,
drink the most expensive wines with great profusion,
and when the reckoning was demanded, to be with∣out
money: If, as it often happened, his company
were willing to defray his part, the affair ended,
without any ill consequences; but if they were re∣fractory,
<PB N="l" REF="55"/>
and expected that the wine should be paid
for by him that drank it, his method of composition
was, to take them with him to his own apartment,
assume the government of the house, and order the
butler in an imperious manner to set the best wine in
the cellar before his company, who often drank till
they forgot the respect due to the house in which
they were entertained, indulged themselves in the
utmost extravagance of merriment, practised the
most licentious frolics, and committed all the out∣rages
of drunkenness.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only charge which Lord Tyr∣connel
brought against him: Having given him a
collection of valuable books, stamped with his own
arms, he had the mortification to see them in a short
time exposed to sale upon the stalls, it being usual
with Mr. Savage, when he wanted a small sum, to
take his books to the pawnbroker.</P>
<P>Whoever was acquainted with Mr. Savage easily
credited both these accusations; for having been
obliged from his first entrance into the world to sub∣sist
upon expedients, affluence was not able to exalt
him above them; and so much was he delighted
with wine and conversation, and so long had he
been accustomed to live by chance, that he would at
any time go to the tavern without scruple, and trust
for his reckoning to the liberality of his company,
and frequently of company to whom he was very
little known. This conduct indeed very seldom
drew upon him those inconveniences that might be
feared by any other person; for his conversation was
so entertaining, and his address so pleasing, that
few thought the pleasure which they received from
him dearly purchased, by paying for his wine. It
was his peculiar happiness, that he scarcely ever
found a stranger, whom he did not leave a friend;
but it must likewise be added, that he had not often
<PB N="li" REF="56"/>
a friend long, without obliging him to become a
stranger.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, on the other hand, declared, that
Lord Tyrconnel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His expression in one of his letters, was, “that Lord T—I▪ had involved his estate, and therefore poorly sought an occasion to quarrel with him.”</NOTE> quarrelled with him, because he
would substract from his own luxury and extrava∣gance
what he had promised to allow him, and that
his resentment was only a plea for the violation of
his promise: He asserted, that he had done nothing
that ought to exclude him from that subsistence which
he thought not so much a favour, as a debt, since
it was offered him upon conditions, which he had
never broken; and that his only fault was, that he
could not be supported with nothing.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, that Lord Tyrconnel often
exhorted him to regulate his method of life, and
not to spend all his nights in taverns, and that he
appeared very desirous, that he would pass those
hours with him, which he so freely bestowed upon
others. This demand Mr. Savage considered as a
censure of his conduct, which he could never pa∣tiently
bear; and which in the latter and cooler part
of his life was so offensive to him, that he declared
it as his resolution, “to spurn that friend who should
presume to dictate to him;” and it is not likely,
that in his earlier years he received admonitions with
more calmness.</P>
<P>He was likewise inclined to resent such expecta∣tions,
as tending to infringe his liberty, of which
he was very jealous, when it was necessary to the
gratification of his passions, and declared, that the
request was still more unreasonable, as the company
to which he was to have been confined was insup∣portably
disagreeable. This assertion affords another
<PB N="lii" REF="57"/>
instance of that inconsistency of his writings with
his conversation, which was so often to be observed.
He forgot how lavishly he had, in his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 3.</NOTE> Dedication
to THE WANDERER, extolled the delicacy and pe∣netration,
the humanity and generosity, the candour
and politeness of the man, whom, when he no
longer loved him, he declared to be a wretch with∣out
understanding, without goodnature, and without
justice; of whose name he thought himself obliged
to leave no trace in any future edition of his wri∣tings;
and accordingly blotted it out of that copy
of THE WANDERER which was in his hands.</P>
<P>During his continuance with the Lord Tyrconnel,
he wrote<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 99.</NOTE> THE TRIUMPH OF HEALTH AND
MIRTH, on the recovery of Lady Tyrconnel from
a languishing illness. This performance is remark∣able,
not only for the gaiety of the ideas, and the
melody of the numbers, but for the agreeable fiction
upon which it is formed. Mirth, overwhelmed with
sorrow for the sickness of her favourite, takes a flight
in quest of her sister Health, whom she finds reclined
upon the brow of a losty mountain, amidst the fra∣grance
of perpetual spring, with the breezes of the
morning sporting about her. Being solicited by her
sister Mirth, she readily promises her assistance, flies
away in a cloud, and impregnates the waters of
Bath with new virtues, by which the sickness of
Belinda is relieved.</P>
<P>As the reputation of his abilities, the particular
circumstances of his birth and life, the splendour of
his appearance, and the distinction which was for
some time paid him by Lord Tyrconnel, intitled
him to familiarity with persons of higher rank, than
those to whose conversation he had been before ad∣mitted,
he did not fail to gratify that curiosity,
<PB N="liii" REF="58"/>
which induced him to take a nearer view of those
whom their birth, their employments, or their for∣tunes,
necessarily place at a distance from the greatest
part of mankind, and to examine whether their
merit was magnified or diminished by the medium
through which it was contemplated; whether the
splendour with which they dazzled their admirers
was inherent in themselves, or only reflected on
them by the objects that surrounded them; and
whether great men were selected for high stations,
or high stations made great men.</P>
<P>For this purpose he took all opportunities of con∣versing
familiarly with those who were most con∣spicuous
at that time for their power or their influ∣ence;
he watched their looser moments, and exa∣mined
their domestic behaviour with that acuteness
which nature had given him, and which the un∣common
variety of his life had contributed to in∣crease,
and that inquisitiveness which must always
be produced in a vigorous mind, by an absolute free∣dom
from all pressing or domestic engagements.
His discernment was quick, and therefore he soon
found in every person, and in every affair, some∣thing
that deserved attention; he was supported by
others, without any care for himself, and was there∣fore
at leisure to pursue his observations.</P>
<P>More circumstances to constitute a critic on hu∣man
life could not easily concur, nor indeed could
any man, who assumed from accidental advantages
more praise than he could justly claim from his real
merit, admit an acquaintance more dangerous than
that of Savage; of whom likewise it must be con∣fessed,
that abilities really exalted above the com∣mon
level, or virtue refined from passion, or proof
against corruption, could not easily find an abler
judge, or a warmer advocate.</P>
<P><PB N="liv" REF="59"/>
What was the result of Mr. Savage's enquiry,
though he was not much accustomed to conceal his
discoveries, it may not be entirely safe to relate,
because the persons whose characters he criticised are
powerful; and power and resentment are seldom
strangers; nor would it perhaps be wholly just, be∣cause
what he asserted in conversation might, though
true in general, be heightened by some momentary
ardour of imagination, and as it can be delivered
only from memory, may be imperfectly represented;
so that the picture at first aggravated, and then un∣skilfully
copied, may be justly suspected to retain no
great resemblance of the original.</P>
<P>It may however be observed, that he did not ap∣pear
to have formed very elevated ideas of those to
whom the administration of affairs, or the conduct
of parties, has been intrusted; who have been con∣sidered
as the advocates of the crown, or the guar∣dians
of the people, and who have obtained the
most implicit confidence, and the loudest applauses.
Of one particular person, who has been at one time
so popular as to be generally esteemed, and at an∣other
so formidable as to be universally detested, he
observed, that his acquisitions had been small, or
that his capacity was narrow, and that the whole
range of his mind was from obscenity to politics,
and from politics to obscenity.</P>
<P>But the opportunity of indulging his speculations
on great characters was now at an end. He was ba∣nished
from the table of Lord Tyrconnel, and turned
again adrift upon the world, without prospect of find∣ing
quickly any other harbour. As prudence was
not one of the virtues by which he was distinguished,
he had made no provision against a misfortune like
this. And though it is not to be imagined, but that
the separation must for some time have been pre∣ceded
by coldness, peevishness, or neglect, though
<PB N="lv" REF="60"/>
it was undoubtedly the consequence of accumulated
provocations on both sides, yet every one that knew
Savage will readily believe, that to him it was sudden
as a stroke of thunder; that though he might have
transiently suspected it, he had never suffered any
thought so unpleasing to sink into his mind, but that
he had driven it away by amusements, or dreams of
future felicity and affluence, and had never taken
any measures by which he might prevent a precipi∣tation
from plenty to indigence.</P>
<P>This quarrel and separation, and the difficulties
to which Mr. Savage was exposed by them, were
soon known both to his friends and enemies; nor
was it long before he perceived, from the behaviour
of both, how much is added to the lustre of genius,
by the ornaments of wealth.</P>
<P>His condition did not appear to excite much com∣passion;
for he had not always been careful to use
the advantages he enjoyed with that moderation,
which ought to have been with more than usual cau∣tion
preserved by him, who knew, if he had reflected,
that he was only a dependant on the bounty of an∣other,
whom he could expect to support him no
longer than he endeavoured to preserve his favour,
by complying with his inclinations, and whom he
nevertheless set at defiance, and was continually irri∣tating
by negligence or encroachments.</P>
<P>Examples need not be sought at any great distance
to prove, that superiority of fortune has a natural
tendency to kindle pride, and that pride seldom fails
to exert itself in contempt and insult; and if this is
often the effect of hereditary wealth, and of honours
enjoyed only by the merit of others, it is some ex∣tenuation
of any indecent triumphs to which this
unhappy man may have been betrayed, that his
prosperity was heightened, by the force of novelty,
and made more intoxicating by a sense of the misery
<PB N="lvi" REF="61"/>
in which he had so long languished, and perhaps of
the insults which he had formerly borne, and which
he might now think himself entitled to revenge. It
is too common for those who have unjustly suffered
pain, to inflict it likewise in their turn, with the
same injustice, and to imagine that they have a right
to treat others as they have themselves been treated.</P>
<P>That Mr. Savage was too much elevated by any
good fortune, is generally known; and some passages
of his Introduction to THE AUTHOR TO BE LET suf∣ficiently
shew, that he did not wholly refrain from
such satire as he afterwards thought very unjust,
when he was exposed to it himself; for when he was
afterwards ridiculed in the character of a distressed
poet, he very easily discovered, that distress was not
a proper subject for merriment, or topic of invective.
He was then able to discern, that if misery be the
effect of virtue, it ought to be reverenced; if of ill-fortune,
to be pitied; and if of vice, not to be in∣sulted,
because it is perhaps itself a punishment ad∣equate
to the crime by which it was produced. And
the humanity of that man can deserve no panegyric,
who is capable of reproaching a criminal in the
hands of the executioner.</P>
<P>But these reflections, though they readily occurred
to him in the first and last parts of his life, were, I
am afraid, for a long time forgotten; at least they
were, like many other maxims, treasured up in his
mind, rather for shew than use, and operated very
little upon his conduct, however elegantly he might
sometimes explain, or however forcibly he might in∣culcate
them.</P>
<P>His degradation therefore from the condition which
he had enjoyed with such wanton thoughtlessness, was
considered by many as an occasion of triumph. Those
who had before paid their court to him, without suc∣cess,
soon returned the contempt which they had
<PB N="lvii" REF="62"/>
suffered, and they who had received favours from
him, for of such favours as he could bestow he was
very liberal, did not always remember them. So
much more certain are the effects of resentment than
of gratitude: it is not only to many more pleasing
to recollect those faults which place others below
them, than those virtues by which they are them∣selves
comparatively depressed; but it is likewise
more easy to neglect, than to recompense; and tho'
there are few who will practise a laborious virtue,
there will never be wanting multitudes that will in∣dulge
an easy vice.</P>
<P>Savage however was very little disturbed at the
marks of contempt which is ill-fortune brought upon
him, from those whom he never esteemed, and with
whom he never considered himself as levelled by any
calamities; and though it was not without some un∣easiness
that he saw some, whose friendship he va∣lued,
change their behaviour; he yet observed their
coldness without much emotion, considered them as
the slaves of fortune and the worshippers of prospe∣rity;
and was more inclined to despise them, than
to lament himself.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that after this return of his
wants, he found mankind equally favourable to him,
as at his first appearance in the world. His story,
though in reality not less melancholy, was less af∣fecting,
because it was no longer new; it therefore
procured him no new friends, and those that had
formerly relieved him thought they might now con∣sign
him to others. He was now likewise considered
by many rather as criminal, than as unhappy; for
the friends of Lord Tyrconnel, and of his mother,
were sufficiently industrious to publish his weaknesses,
which were indeed very numerous, and nothing was
forgotten, that might make him either hateful or ri∣diculous.</P>
<P><PB N="lviii" REF="63"/>
It cannot but be imagined, that such representa∣tions
of his faults must make great numbers less sen∣sible
of his distress; many who had only an oppor∣tunity
to hear one part, made no scruple to propa∣gate
the account which they received; many assisted
their circulation from malice or revenge, and perhaps many pre∣tended
to credit them, that they
might with a better grace withdraw their regard, or
withhold their assistance.</P>
<P>Savage however was not one of those, who suffered
himself to be injured without resistance, nor was less
diligent in exposing the faults of Lord Tyrconnel,
over whom he obtained at least this advantage, that
he drove him first to the practice of outrage and vio∣lence;
for he was so much provoked by the wit and
virulence of Savage, that he came with a number of
attendants, that did no honour to his courage, to
beat him at a coffee-house. But it happened that he
had left the place a few minutes, and his lordship
had without danger the pleasure of boasting, how he
would have treated him. Mr. Savage went next day
to repay his visit at his own house, but was prevailed
on by his domestics, to retire without insisting upon
seeing him.</P>
<P>Lord Tyrconnel was accused by Mr. Savage of
some actions, which scarcely any provocations will
be thought sufficient to justify; such as seizing what
he had in his lodgings, and other instances of wan∣ton
cruelty, by which he encreased the distress of
Savage, without any advantage to himself.</P>
<P>These mutual accusations were retorted on both
sides for many years, with the utmost degree of viru∣lence
and rage, and time seemed rather to augment
than diminish their resentment. That the anger of
Mr. Savage should be kept alive is not strange, be∣cause
he felt every day the consequences of the quar∣rel;
but it might reasonably have been hoped, that
<PB N="lix" REF="64"/>
Lord Tyrconnel might have relented, and at length
have forgot those provocations, which, however they
might have once inflamed him, had not in reality
much hurt him.</P>
<P>The spirit of Mr. Savage indeed never suffered
him to solicit a reconciliation; he returned reproach
for reproach, and insult for insult; his superiority
of wit supplied the disadvantages of his fortune, and
enabled him to form a party, and prejudice great
numbers in his favour.</P>
<P>But though this might be some gratification of his
vanity, it afforded very little relief to his necessities,
and he was very frequently reduced to uncommon
hardships, of which, however, he never made any
mean or importunate complaints, being formed ra∣ther
to bear misery with fortitude, than enjoy pro∣sperity
with moderation.</P>
<P>He now thought himself again at liberty to ex∣pose
the cruelty of his mother, and therefore, I be∣lieve,
about this time, published THE BASTARD, a
poem remarkable for the vivacious sallies of thought
in the beginning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 91.</NOTE>, where he makes a pompous enu∣meration
of the imaginary advantages of base birth,
and the pathetic sentiments at the end, where he
recounts the real calamities which he suffered by the
crime of his parents.</P>
<P>The vigour and spirit of the verses, the peculiar
circumstances of the author, the novelty of the sub∣ject,
and the notoriety of the story, to which the
allusions are made, procured this performance a very
favourable reception; great numbers were imme∣diately
dispersed, and editions were multiplied with
unusual rapidity.</P>
<P>One circumstance attended the publication, which
Savage used to relate with great satisfaction. His
<PB N="lx" REF="65"/>
mother, to whom the poem was with “due reverence”
inscribed, happened then to be at Bath, where she
could not conveniently retire from censure, or con∣ceal
herself from observation; and no sooner did the
reputation of the poem begin to spread, than she
heard it repeated in all places of concourse, nor
could she enter the assembly-rooms, or cross the
walks, without being saluted with some lines from
THE BASTARD.</P>
<P>This was perhaps the first time that ever she dis∣covered
a sense of shame, and on this occasion the
power of wit was very conspicuous; the wretch who
had, without scruple, proclaimed herself an adul∣teress,
and who had first endeavoured to starve her
son, then to transport him, and afterwards to hang
him, was not able to bear the representation of her
own conduct, but fled from reproach, though she
felt no pain from guilt, and left Bath with the utmost
haste, to shelter herself among the crowds of Lon∣don.</P>
<P>Thus Savage had the satisfaction of finding, that
though he could not reform his mother, he could
punish her, and that he did not always suffer alone.</P>
<P>The pleasure which he received from this increase
of his poetical reputation, was sufficient for some
time to overbalance the miseries of want, which
this performance did not much alleviate, for it was
sold for a very trivial sum to a bookseller, who,
though the success was so uncommon, that five im∣pressions
were sold, of which many were undoubtedly
very numerous, had not generosity sufficient to ad∣mit
the unhappy writer to any part of the profit.</P>
<P>The sale of this poem was always mentioned by
Savage with the utmost elevation of heart, and re∣ferred
to by him as an incontestable proof of a ge∣neral
acknowledgment of his abilities. It was in∣deed
<PB N="lxi" REF="66"/>
the only production of which he could justly
boast a general reception.</P>
<P>But though he did not lose the opportunity which
success gave him of setting a high rate on his abi∣lities,
but paid due deference to the suffrages of
mankind when they were given in his favour, he
did not suffer his esteem of himself to depend upon
others, nor found any thing sacred in the voice of
the people when they were inclined to censure him;
he then readily shewed the folly of expecting that
the public should judge right, observed how slowly
poetical merit had often forced its way into the
world; he contented himself with the applause of
men of judgment, and was somewhat disposed to
exclude all those from the character of men of judg∣ment,
who did not applaud him.</P>
<P>But he was at other times more favourable to
mankind, than to think them blind to the beauties
of his works, and imputed the slowness of their sale
to other causes; either they were published at a time
when the town was empty, or when the attention of
the public was engrossed by some struggle in the
parliament, or some other object of general concern;
or they were by the neglect of the publisher not
diligently dispersed, or by his avarice not advertised
with sufficient frequency. Address, or industry, or
liberality, was always wanting; and the blame was
laid rather on any other person than the author.</P>
<P>By arts like these, arts which every man practises
in some degree, and to which too much of the little
tranquillity of life is to be ascribed, Savage was
always able to live at peace with himself. Had he
indeed only made use of these expedients to alleviate
the loss or want of fortune or reputation, or any
other advantages, which it is not in man's power to
bestow upon himself, they might have been justly
mentioned as instances of a philosophical mind, and
<PB N="lxii" REF="67"/>
very properly proposed to the imitation of multitudes,
who, for want of diverting their imaginations with
the same dexterity, languish under afflictions which
might be easily removed.</P>
<P>It were doubtless to be wished, that truth and
reason were universally prevalent; that every thing
were esteemed according to its real value; and that
men would secure themselves from being disappointed
in their endeavours after happiness, by placing it
only in virtue, which is always to be obtained; but
if adventitious and foreign pleasures must be pur∣sued,
it would be perhaps of some benefit, since
that pursuit must frequently be fruitless, if the prac∣tice
of Savage could be taught, that folly might be
an antidote to folly, and one fallacy be obviated by
another.</P>
<P>But the danger of this pleasing intoxication must
not be concealed; nor indeed can any one, after
having observed the life of Savage, need to be cau∣tioned
against it. By imputing none of his miseries
to himself, he continued to act upon the same prin∣ciples,
and to follow the same path; was never made
wiser by his sufferings, nor preserved by one mis∣fortune
from falling into another. He proceeded
throughout his life to tread the same steps on the
same circle; always applauding his past conduct, or
at least forgetting it, to amuse himself with phan∣toms
of happiness, which were dancing before him;
and willingly turned his eyes from the light of
reason, when it would have discovered the illusion,
and shewn him, what he never wished to see, his
real state.</P>
<P>He is even accused, after having lulled his ima∣gination
with those ideal opiates, of having tried
the same experiment upon his conscience; and having
accustomed himself to impute all deviations from the
right to foreign causes, it is certain that he was upon
<PB N="lxiii" REF="68"/>
every occasion too easily reconciled to himself, and
that he appeared very little to regret those practices
which had impaired his reputation. The reigning
error of his life was, that he mistook the love for the
practice of virtue, and was indeed not so much a
good man, as the friend of goodness.</P>
<P>This at least must be allowed him, that he always
preserved a strong sense of the dignity, the beauty,
and the necessity of virtue, and that he never con∣tributed
deliberately to spread corruption amongst
mankind; his actions, which were generally pre∣cipitate,
were often blameable; but his writings,
being the productions of study, uniformly tended to
the exaltation of the mind, and the propagation of
morality and piety.</P>
<P>These writings may improve mankind, when his
failings shall be forgotten, and therefore he must be
considered upon the whole as a benefactor to the
world; nor can his personal example do any hurt,
since, whoever hears of his faults, will hear of the
miseries which they brought upon him, and which
would deserve less pity, had not his condition been
such as made his faults pardonable. He may be
considered as a child exposed to all the temptations
of indigence, at an age when resolution was not yet
strengthened by conviction, nor virtue confirmed by
habit; a circumstance, which in his BASTARD he
laments in a very affecting manner.</P>
<LG>
<L>—No Mother's care</L>
<L>Shielded my infant innocence with pray'r:</L>
<L>No Father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd,</L>
<L>Call'd forth my virtues, or from vice restrain'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>THE BASTARD, however it might provoke or
mortify his mother, could not be expected to melt
her to compassion, so that he was still under the same
<PB N="lxiv" REF="69"/>
want of the necessaries of life, and he therefore ex∣erted
all the interest which his wit, or his birth, or his
misfortunes could procure, to obtain upon the death
of Eusden the place of Poet Laureat, and prose∣cuted
his application with so much diligence, that
the King publickly declared it his intention to be∣stow
it upon him; but such was the fate of Savage,
that even the King, when he intended his advantage,
was disappointed in his schemes; for the Lord Cham∣berlain,
who has the disposal of the laurel, as one
of the appendages of his office, either did not know
the King's design, or did not approve it, or thought
the nomination of the Laureat an encroachment up∣on
his rights, and therefore bestowed the laurel upon
Colly Cibber.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, thus disappointed, took a resolution
of applying to the Queen, that having once given
him life, she would enable him to support it, and
therefore published a short poem on her birth-day,
to which he gave the odd title of VOLUNTEER
LAUREAT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol II p. 220.</NOTE> The event of this essay he has himself
related in the following letter, which he prefixed to
the poem, when he afterwards reprinted it in THE
GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE, from whence I have
copied it intire, as this was one of the few attempts
in which Mr. Savage succeeded.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Mr. URBAN,”</OPENER>
<P>“In your Magazine for February you published
the last VOLUNTEER LAUREAT, written on a very
melancholy occasion, the death of the royal pa∣troness
of arts and literature in general, and of the
author of that poem in particular: I now send you
the first that Mr. Savage wrote under that title.—
This gentleman, notwithstanding a very consider∣able
<PB N="lxv" REF="70"/>
interest, being, on the death of Mr. Eusden,
disappointed of the Laureat's place, wrote the be∣fore-mentioned
poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 220.</NOTE>; which were no sooner pub∣lished,
but the late Queen sent to a bookseller for them:
the author had not at that time a friend either to
get him introduced, or his poem presented at court;
yet such was the unspeakable goodness of that
Princess, that, notwithstanding this act of cere∣mony
was wanting, in a few days after publication,
Mr. Savage received a Bank-bill of fifty pounds,
and a gracious message from her Majesty, by the
Lord North and Guildford, to this effect:” “That
her Majesty was highly pleased with the verses;
that she took particularly kind his lines there re∣lating
to the King; that he had permission to write
annually on the same subject; and that he should
yearly receive the like present, till something bet∣ter
(which was her Majesty's intention) could be
done for him.” “After this he was permitted to
present one of his annual poems to her Majesty,
had the honour of kissing her hand, and met with
the most gracious reception.</P>
<CLOSER>Your's, &amp;c.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Such was the performance, and such its reception;
a reception which, though by no means unkind, was
yet not in the highest degree generous: to chain
down the genius of a writer to an annual panegyric,
shewed in the Queen too much desire of hearing her
own praises, and a greater regard to herself than to
him on whom her bounty was conferred. It was a
kind of avaricious generosity, by which flattery was
rather purchased than genius rewarded.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldfield had formerly given him the same
allowance with much more heroic intention; she had
no other view than to enable him to prosecute his
studies, and to set himself above the want of assist∣ance,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="71"/>
and was contented with doing good without
stipulating for encomiums.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however was not at liberty to make
exceptions, but was ravished with the favours which
he had received, and probably yet more with those
which he was promised; he considered himself now
as a favourite of the Queen, and did not doubt but
a few annual poems would establish him in some pro∣fitable
employment.</P>
<P>He therefore assumed the title of VOLUNTEER
LAUREAT, not without some reprehensions from
Cibber, who informed him, that the title of LAU∣REAT
was a mark of honour conferred by the King,
from whom all honour is derived, and which there∣fore
no man has a right to bestow upon himself; and
added, that he might with equal propriety stile him∣self
a Volunteer Lord, or Volunteer Baronet. It
cannot be denied that the remark was just; but Sa∣vage
did not think any title, which was conferred
upon Mr. Cibber, so honourable as that the usurpa∣tion
of it could be imputed to him as an instance of
very exorbitant vanity, and therefore continued to
write under the same title, and received every year
the same reward.</P>
<P>He did not appear to consider these encomiums as
tests of his abilities, or as any thing more than an∣nual
hints to the Queen of her promise, or acts of
ceremony, by the performance of which he was in∣titled
to his pension, and therefore did not labour
them with great diligence, or print more than fifty
each year, except that for some of the last years he
regularly inserted them in THE GENTLEMAN'S
MAGAZINE, by which they were dispersed over the
kingdom.</P>
<P>Of some of them he had himself so low an opi∣nion,
that he intended to omit them in the collection
of poems, for which he printed proposals, and soli∣cited
<PB N="lxvii" REF="72"/>
subscriptions; nor can it seem strange, that
being confined to the same subject, he should be at
some times indolent, and at others unsuccessful; that
he should sometimes delay a disagreeable task, till it
was too late to perform it well; or that he should
sometimes repeat the same sentiment on the same
occasion, or at others be missed by an attempt after
novelty to forced conceptions, and far-fetched image.</P>
<P>He wrote indeed with a double intention, which
supplied him with some variety; for his business was
to praise the Queen for the favours which he had re∣ceived,
and to complain to her of the delay of those
which she had promised: in some of his pieces, there∣fore,
gratitude is predominant, and in some discon∣tent;
in some he represents himself as happy in her
patronage, and in others as disconsolate to find him∣self
neglected.</P>
<P>Her promise, like other promises made to this
unfortunate man, was never performed, though he
took sufficient care that it should not be forgotten.
The publication of his VOLUNTEER LAUREAT pro∣cured
him no other reward than a regular remittance
of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>He was not so depressed by his disappointments as
to neglect any opportunity that was offered of ad∣vancing
his interest. When the Princess Anne was
married, he wrote a poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. II. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> upon her departure, only,
as he declared, “because it was expected from him,”
and he was not willing to bar his own prospects by
any appearance of neglect.</P>
<P>He never mentioned any advantage gained by this
poem, or any regard that was paid to it, and there∣fore
it is likely that it was considered at court as an
act of duty to which he was obliged by his depen∣dence,
and which it was therefore not necessary to
reward by any new favour: or perhaps the Queen
really intended his advancement, and therefore
<PB N="lxviii" REF="73"/>
thought it superfluous to lavish presents upon a man
whom she intended to establish for life.</P>
<P>About this time not only his hopes were in danger
of being frustrated, but his pension likewise of be∣ing
obstructed by an accidental calumny. The writer
of THE DAILY COURANT, a paper then published
under the direction of the ministry, charged him
with a crime, which though not very great in itself,
would have been remarkably invidious in him, and
might very justly have incensed the Queen against
him. He was accused by name of influencing elec∣tions
against the court, by appearing at the head of
a tory mob; nor did the accuser fail to aggravate
his crime, by representing it as the effect of the
most atrocious ingratitude, and a kind of rebellion
against the Queen, who had first preserved him from
an infamous death, and afterwards distinguished
him by her favour, and supported him by her cha∣rity.
The charge, as it was open and confident,
was likewise by good fortune very particular. The
place of the transaction was mentioned, and the
whole series of the rioter's conduct related. This
exactness made Mr. Savage's vindication easy; for
he never had in his life seen the place which was de∣clared
to be the scene of his wickedness, nor ever
had been present in any town when its representatives
were chosen. This answer he therefore made haste
to publish, with all the circumstances necessary to
make it credible, and very reasonably demanded,
that the accusation should be retracted in the same
paper, that he might no longer suffer the imputation
of sedition and ingratitude. This demand was like∣wise
pressed by him in a private letter to the author
of the paper, who either trusting to the protection
of those whose defence he had undertaken, or having
entertained some personal malice against Mr. Savage,
or fearing, lest, by retracting so confident an asser∣tion,
<PB N="lxix" REF="74"/>
he should impair the credit of his paper, re∣fused
to give him that satisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage therefore thought it necessary, to his
own vindication, to prosecute him in the King's
Bench; but as he did not find any ill effects from
the accusation, having sufficiently cleared his inno∣cence,
he thought any farther procedure would have
the appearance of revenge, and therefore willingly
dropped it.</P>
<P>He saw soon afterwards a process commenced in
the same court against himself, on an information in
which he was accused of writing and publishing an
obscene pamphlet.</P>
<P>It was always Mr. Savage's desire to be distin∣guished,
and when any controversy became popular,
he never wanted some reason for engaging in it with
great ardour, and appearing at the head of the party
which he had chosen. As he was never celebrated
for his prudence, he had no sooner taken his side,
and informed himself of the chief topics of the dis∣pute,
than he took all opportunities of asserting and
propagating his principles, without much regard to
his own interest, or any other visible design than that
of drawing upon himself the attention of mankind.</P>
<P>The dispute between the Bishop of London and
the Chancellor is well known to have been for some
time the chief topic of political conversation, and
therefore Mr. Savage, in pursuance of his character,
endeavoured to become conspicuous among the con∣trovertists
with which every coffee-house was filled
on that occasion. He was an indefatigable opposer
of all the claims of ecclesiastical power, though he
did not know on what they were founded, and was
therefore no friend to the Bishop of London. But
he had another reason for appearing as a warm ad∣vocate
for Dr. Rundle, for he was the friend of Mr.
<PB N="lxx" REF="75"/>
Foster and Mr. Thompson, who were the friends of
Mr. Savage.</P>
<P>Thus remote was his interest in the question, which
however, as he imagined, concerned him so nearly,
that it was not sufficient to harangue and dispute,
but necessary likewise to write upon it.</P>
<P>He therefore engaged with great ardour in a new
Poem, called by him, THE PROGRESS OF A DIVINE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. III.</NOTE>,
in which he conducts a profligate priest by all the
gradations of wickedness from a poor curacy in the
country, to the highest preferments of the church,
and describes with that humour which was natural
to him, and that knowledge which was extended to
all the diversities of human life, his behaviour in every
station, and insinuates, that this priest, thus accom∣plished,
found at last a patron in the Bishop of
London.</P>
<P>When he was asked by one of his friends, on what
pretence he could charge the Bishop with such an
action, he had no more to say, than that he had only
inverted the accusation, and that he thought it rea∣sonable
to believe, that he, who obstructed the rise
of a good man without reason, would for bad reasons
promote the exaltation of a villain.</P>
<P>The clergy were universally provoked by this
satire, and Savage, who, as was his constant prac∣tice,
had set his name to his performance, was cen∣sured
in THE WEEKLY MISCELLANY<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>A short satire was likewise published in the same paper, in which were the following lines:</P>
<L>For cruel murder doom'd to hempen death,</L>
<L>Savage, by royal grace, prolong'd his breath.</L>
<L>Well might you think he spent his future years</L>

<P><PB N="lxxi" REF="76"/>
But a return of invective was not thought a suf∣ficient
punishment. The Court of King's Bench
was therefore moved against him, and he was obliged
<PB N="lxxii" REF="77"/>
to return an answer to a charge of obscenity. It
was urged in his defence, that obscenity was criminal
when it was intended to promote the practice of vice,
but that Mr. Savage had only introduced obscene ideas,
with the view of exposing them to detestation, and
of amending the age, by shewing the deformity of
wickedness. This plea was admitted, and Sir Philip
Yorke, who then presided in that court, dismissed
the information with encomiums upon the purity and
excellence of Mr. Savage's writings.</P>
<P>The prosecution, however, answered in some mea∣sure
the purpose of those by whom it was set on
foot; for Mr. Savage was so far intimidated by it,
that when the edition of his poem was sold, he did
not venture to reprint it; so that it was in a short
time forgotten, or forgotten by all but those whom
it offended.</P>
<P>It is said, that some endeavours were used to in∣cense
the Queen against him, but he found advocates
to obviate at least part of their effect; for though he
was never advanced, he still continued to receive his
pension.</P>
<P>This poem drew more insamy upon him than any
incident of his life, and as his conduct cannot be
vindicated, it is proper to secure his memory from
reproach, by informing those whom he made his
enemies, that he never intended to repeat the pro∣vocation;
and that, though whenever he thought he
had any reason to complain of the clergy, he used
to threaten them with a new edition of THE PRO∣GRESS
OF A DIVINE, it was his calm and settled
resolution to suppress it for ever.</P>
<P>He once intended to have made a better reparation
for the folly or injustice with which he might be
charged, by writing another poem, called, THE
PROGRESS OF A FREETHINKER, whom he intended
to lead through all the stages of vice and folly, to
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="78"/>
convert him from virtue to wickedness, and from
religion to infidelity, by all the modish sophistry used
for that purpose; and at last to dismiss him by his
own hand into the other world.</P>
<P>That he did not execute this design is a real loss
to mankind, for he was too well acquainted with all
the scenes of debauchery to have failed in his re∣presentations
of them, and too zealous for virtue not
to have represented them in such a manner as should
expose them either to ridicule or detestation.</P>
<P>But this plan was like others, formed and laid
aside, till the vigour of his imagination was spent,
and the effervescence of invention had subsided, but
soon gave way to some other design, which pleased
by its novelty for a while, and then was neglected
like the former.</P>
<P>He was still in his usual exigencies, having no
certain support but the pension allowed him by the
Queen, which, though it might have kept an exact
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomist from want, was very far from being suf∣ficient
for Mr. Savage, who had never been accus∣tomed
to dismiss any of his appetites without the
gratification which they solicited, and whom nothing
but want of money withheld from partaking of
every pleasure that fell within his view.</P>
<P>His conduct with regard to his pension was very
particular. No sooner had he changed the bill, than
he vanished from the sight of all his acquaintances,
and lay for some time out of the reach of all the
enquiries that friendship or curiosity could make
after him; at length he appeared again pennyless as
before, but never informed even those whom he
seemed to regard most, where he had been, nor was
his retreat ever discovered.</P>
<P>This was his constant practice during the whole
time that he received the pension from the Queen:
He regularly disappeared and returned. He indeed
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="79"/>
affirmed, that he retired to study, and that the money
supported him in solitude for many months; but his
friends declared, that the short time in which it was
spent sufficiently confuted his own account of his
conduct.</P>
<P>His politeness and his wit still raised him friends,
who were desirous of setting him at length free from
that indigence by which he had been hitherto op∣pressed,
and therefore solicited Sir Robert Walpole
in his favour with so much earnestness, that they
obtained a promise of the next place that should
become vacant, not exceeding two hundred pounds
a year. This promise was made with an uncommon
declaration. “that it was not the promise of a mi∣nister
to a petitioner, but of a friend to his friend.”</P>
<P>Mr. Savage now concluded himself set at ease for
ever, and as he observe, in a poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 173.</NOTE> written on that
incident of his life, trusted and was trusted, but soon
found that his confidence was ill-grounded, and this
friendly promise was not inviolable. He spent a
long time in solicitations, and at last despaired and
desisted.</P>
<P>He did not indeed deny that he had given the
minister some reason to believe that he should not
strengthen his own interest by advancing him, for he
had taken care to distinguish himself in coffee-houses
as an advocate for the ministry of the last years of
Queen Anne, and was always ready to justify the
conduct, and exalt the character of Lord Boling∣broke,
whom he mentions with great regard in an
epistle upon authors, which he wrote about that
time, but was too wise to publish, and of which
only some fragments<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 202.</NOTE> have appeared, inserted by
him in the MAGAZINE after his retirement.</P>
<P>To despair was not, however, the character of
Savage; when one patronage failed, he had recourse
<PB N="lxxv" REF="80"/>
to another. The prince was now extremely popular,
and had very liberally rewarded the merit of some
writers, whom Mr. Savage did not think superior to
himself, and therefore he resolved to address a poem
to him.</P>
<P>For this purpose he made choice of a subject,
which could regard only persons of the highest rank
and greatest affluence, and which was therefore pro∣per
for a poem intended to procure the patronage of
a prince; and having retired for some time to Rich∣mond,
that he might prosecute his design in full
tranquillity, without the temptations of pleasure, or
the solicitations of creditors, by which his medita∣tions
were in equal danger of being disconcerted, he
produced a poem ON PUBLIC SPIRIT, WITH RE∣GARD
TO PUBLIC WORKS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plan of this poem is very extensive, and com∣prises
a multitude of topics, each of which might
furnish matter sufficient for a long performance, and
of which some have already employed more eminent
writers; but as he was perhaps not fully acquainted
with the whole extent of his own design, and was
writing to obtain a supply of wants too pressing to
admit of long or accurate enquiries, he passes neg∣ligently
over many public works, which, even in
his own opinion, deserved to be more elaborately
treated.</P>
<P>But though he may sometimes disappoint his reader
by transient touches upon these subjects, which have
often been considered, and therefore naturally raise
expectations, he must be allowed amply to compen∣sate
his omissions, by expatiating in the conclusion
of his work upon a kind of beneficence not yet
celebrated by any eminent poet, though it now
appears more susceptible of embellishments, more
adapted to exalt the ideas, and affect the passions,
than many of those which have hitherto been thought

most worthy of the ornaments of verse. The settle∣ment
of colonies in uninhabited countries, the esta∣blishment
of those in security, whose misfortunes
have made their own country no longer pleasing or
safe, the acquisition of property without injury to
any, the appropriation of the waste and luxuriant
bounties of nature, and the enjoyment of those gifts
which heaven has scattered upon regions uncultivated
and unoccupied, cannot be considered without giving
rise to a great number of pleasing ideas, and be∣wildering
the imagination in delightful prospects;
and, therefore, whatever speculations they may pro∣duce
in those who have confined themselves to po∣litical
studies, naturally fixed the attention, and
excited the applause of a poet. The politician,
when he considers men driven into other countries
for shelter, and obliged to retire to forests and de∣serts,
and pass their lives and fix their posterity in
the remotest corners of the world, to avoid those
hardships which they suffer or fear in their native
place, may very properly enquire why the legislature
does not provide a remedy for these miseries, rather
than encourage an escape from them. He may con∣clude,
that the flight of every honest man is a loss
to the community, that those who are unhappy
without guilt ought to be relieved, and the life,
which is overburthened by accidental calamities, set
at ease by the care of the public; and that those,
who have by misconduct forfeited their claim to
favour, ought rather to be made useful to the society
which they have injured, than be driven from it.
But the poet is employed in a more pleasing under∣taking
than that of proposing laws, which, however
just or expedient, will never be made, or endeavour∣ing
to reduce to rational schemes of government
societies which were formed by chance, and are con∣ducted
by the private passions of those who preside in
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="82"/>
them. He guides the unhappy fugitive from want
and persecution, to plenty, quiet, and security, and
seats him in scenes of peaceful solitude, and undi∣sturbed
repose.</P>
<P>Savage has not forgotten, amidst the pleasing sen∣timents
which this prospect of retirement suggested
to him, to censure those crimes which have been
generally committed by the discoverers of new re∣gions,
and to expose the enormous wickedness of
making war upon barbarous nations because they
cannot resist, and of invading countries because they
are fruitful; of extending navigation only to pro∣pagate
vice, and of visiting distant lands only to lay
them waste. He has asserted the natural equality of
mankind, and endeavoured to suppress that pride
which inclines men to imagine that right is the con∣sequence
of power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His description of the various miseries which force
men to seek for refuge in distant countries, affords
another instance of his proficiency in the important
and extensive study of human life, and the tender∣ness
with which he recounts them, another proof of
his humanity and benevolence.</P>
<P>It is observable, that the close of this poem dis∣covers
a change which experience had made in Mr.
Savage's opinions. In a poem written by him in his
youth, and published in his Miscellanies, he de∣clares
his contempt of the contracted views and nar∣row
prospects of the middle state of life, and de∣clares
his resolution either to tower like the cedar,
or be trampled like the shrub; but in this poem,
though addressed to a prince, he mentions this state
of life as comprising those who ought most to attract
reward, those who merit most the confidence of
power, and the familiarity of greatness, and acci∣dentally
mentioning this passage to one of his friends,
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="83"/>
declared, that in his opinion all the virtue of man∣kind
was comprehended in that state.</P>
<P>In describing villas and gardens, he did not omit
to condemn that absurd custom which prevails among
the English of permitting servants to receive money
from strangers for the entertainment that they re∣ceive,
and therefore inserted in his poem these lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>But what the flow'ring pride of gardens rare,</L>
<L>However royal, or however fair,</L>
<L>If gates, which to access should still give way,</L>
<L>Ope but, like Peter's paradise, for pay?</L>
<L>If perquisited varlets frequent stand,</L>
<L>And each new walk must a new tax demand?</L>
<L>What foreign eye but with contempt surveys?</L>
<L>What muse shall from oblivion snatch their praise?</L>
</LG>
<P>But before the publication of his performance he
recollected, that the Queen allowed her garden and
cave at Richmond to be shewn for money, and that
she so openly countenanced the practice, that she
had bestowed the privilege of shewing them as a
place of profit on a man, whose merit she valued
herself upon rewarding, though she gave him only
the liberty of disgracing his country.</P>
<P>He therefore thought, with more prudence than
was often exerted by him, that the publication of
these lines might be officiously represented as an
insult upon the Queen, to whom he owed his life
and his subsistence, and that the propriety of his
observation would be no security against the censures
which the unseasonableness of it might draw upon
him; he therefore suppressed the passage in the first
edition, but after the Queen's death thought the
same caution no longer necessary, and restored it to
the proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxix" REF="84"/>
The poem was therefore published without any
political faults, and inscribed to the Prince; but
Mr. Savage, having no friend upon whom he could
prevail to present it to him, had no other method of
attracting his observation than the publication of
frequent advertisements, and therefore received no
reward from his patron, however generous on other
occasions.</P>
<P>This disappointment he never mentioned without
indignation, being by some means or other confident
that the Prince was not ignorant of his address to
him, and insinuated, that if any advances in popu∣larity
could have been made by distinguishing him,
he had not written without notice, or without reward.</P>
<P>He was once inclined to have presented his poem
in person, and sent to the printer for a copy with
that design; but either his opinion changed, or his
resolution deserted him, and he continued to resent
neglect without attempting to force himself into
regard.</P>
<P>Nor was the public much more favourable than
his patron, for only seventy-two were sold, though
the performance was much commended by some
whose judgment in that kind of writing is generally
allowed. But Savage easily reconciled himself to
mankind without imputing any defect to his work,
by observing that his poem was unluckily published
two days after the prorogation of the parliament,
and by consequence at a time when all those who
could be expected to regard it were in the hurry of
preparing for their departure, or engaged in taking
leave of others upon their dismission from public
affairs.</P>
<P>It must be however allowed, in justification of the
public, that this performance is not the most excel∣lent
of Mr. Savage's works, and that though it can∣not
be denied to contain many striking sentiments,
<PB N="lxxx" REF="85"/>
majestic lines, and just observations, it is in general
not sufficiently polished in the language, or enlivened
in the imagery, or digested in the plan.</P>
<P>Thus his poem contributed nothing to the allevia∣tion
of his poverty, which was such as very few
could have supported with equal patience, but to
which it must likewise be confessed, that few would
have been exposed who received punctually fifty
pounds a year; a salary which though by no means
equal to the demands of vanity and luxury, is yet
found sufficient to support families above want, and
was undoubtedly more than the necessities of life
require.</P>
<P>But no sooner had he received his pension, than
he withdrew to his darling privacy, from which he
returned in a short time to his former distress, and
for some part of the year generally lived by chance,
eating only when he was invited to the tables of his
acquaintances, from which the meanness of his dress
often excluded him, when the politeness and variety
of his conversation would have been thought a suffi∣cient
recompence for his entertainment.</P>
<P>He lodged as much by accident as he dined, and
passed the night, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>metimes in mean houses, which
are set open at night to any casual wanderers, some∣times
in cellars among the riot and filth of the meanest
and most profligate of the rabble; and sometimes,
when he had not money to support even the expences
of these receptacles, walked about the streets till he
was weary, and lay down in the summer upon a
bulk, or in the winter with his associates in poverty,
among the ashes of a glass-house.</P>
<P>In this manner were passed those days and those
nights which nature had enabled him to have em∣ployed
in elevated speculations, useful studies, or
pleasing conversation. On a bulk, in a cellar, or
in a glass-house among thieves and beggars, was to
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="86"/>
be found the Author of THE WANDERER, the man
of exalted sentiments, extensive views, and curious
observations; the man whose remarks on life might
have assisted the statesman, whose ideas of virtue
might have enlightened the moralist, whose eloquence
might have influenced senates, and whose delicacy
might have polished courts.</P>
<P>It cannot be imagined that such necessities might
sometimes force him upon disreputable practices;
and it is probable that these lines in THE WAN∣DERER
were occasioned by his reflections on his own
conduct:</P>
<LG>
<L>Tho' mis'ry leads to happiness, and truth,</L>
<L>Unequal to the load, this languid youth,</L>
<L>(O, let none censure, if, untried by grief,</L>
<L>If, amidst woe, untempted by relief,)</L>
<L>He stoop'd reluctant to low arts of shame,</L>
<L>Which then, e'en then he scorn'd, and blush'd to name.</L>
</LG>
<P>Whoever was acquainted with him was certain to
be solicited for small sums, which the frequency of
the request made in time considerable, and he was
therefore quickly shunned by those who were become
familiar enough to be trusted with his necessities;
but his rambling manner of life, and constant ap∣pearance
at houses of public resort, always procured
him a new succession of friends, whose kindness had
not been exhausted by repeated requests, so that he
was seldom absolutely without resources, but had in
his utmost exigences this comfort, that he always
imagined himself sure of speedy relief.</P>
<P>It was observed that he always asked favours of
this kind without the least submission or apparent
consciousness of dependence, and that he did not
seem to look upon a compliance with his request as
an obligation that deserved any extraordinary ac∣knowledgments,
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="87"/>
but a refusal was resented by him
as an affront, or complained of as an injury; nor
did he readily reconcile himself to those who either
denied to lend, or gave him afterwards any intima∣tion,
that they expected to be repaid.</P>
<P>He was sometimes so far compassionated by those
who knew both his merit and distresses, that they
received him into their families, but they soon dis∣covered
him to be a very incommodious inmate; for
being always accustomed to an irregular manner of
life, he could not confine himself to any stated
hours, or pay any regard to the rules of a family,
but would prolong his conversation till midnight,
without considering that business might require his
friend's application in the morning; and when he
had persuaded himself to retire to bed, was not,
without equal difficulty, called up to dinner; it was
therefore impossible to pay him any distinction with∣out
the entire subversion of all economy, a kind of
establishment which, wherever he went, he always
appeared ambitious to overthrow.</P>
<P>It must therefore be acknowledged, in justification
of mankind, that it was not always by the negli∣gence
or coldness of his friends that Savage was
distressed, but because it was in reality very difficult
to preserve him long in a state of ease. To supply
him with money was a hopeless attempt, for no
sooner did he see himself master of a sum sufficient
to set him free from care for a day, than he became
profuse and luxurious. When once he had entered
a tavern, or engaged in a scheme of pleasure, he
never retired till want of money obliged him to some
new expedient. If he was entertained in a family,
nothing was any longer to be regarded there but
amusements and jollity; wherever Savage entered he
immediately expected that order and business should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly before him, that all should thenceforward be left
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="88"/>
to hazard, and that no dull principle of domestic
management should be opposed to his inclination, or
intrude upon his gaiety.</P>
<P>His distresses, however afflictive, never dejected
him; in his lowest state he wanted not spirit to assert
the natural dignity of wit, and was always ready to
repress that insolence which superiority of fortune
incited, and to trample that reputation which rose
upon any other basis than that of merit: he never
admitted any gross familiarities, or submitted to be
treated otherwise than as an equal. Once, when he
was without lodging, meat, or cloaths, one of his
friends, a man not indeed remarkable for modera∣tion
in his prosperity, left a message, that he de∣sired
to see him about nine in the morning. Savage
knew that his intention was to assist him, but was
very much disgusted that he should▪ presume to pre∣scribe
the hour of his attendance, and, I believe,
refused to visit him, and rejected his kindness.</P>
<P>The same invincible temper, whether firmness or
obstinacy, appeared in his conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord Tyr∣connel,
from whom he very frequently demanded
that the allowance which was once paid him should
be restored, but with whom he never appeared to
entertain for a moment the thought of soliciting a
reconciliation, and whom he treated at once with all
the haughtiness of superiority, and all the bitterness
of resentment. He wrote to him not in a style of
supplication or respect, but of reproach, menace and
contempt; and appeared determined, if he ever re∣gained
his allowance, to hold it only by the right of
conquest.</P>
<P>As many more can discover, that a man is richer
than that he is wiser than themselves, superiority of
understanding is not so readily acknowledged as that
of fortune; nor is that haughtiness, which the con∣sciousness
of great abilities incites, borne with the
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="89"/>
same submission as the tyranny of affluence; and
therefore Savage, by asserting his claim to deference
and regard, and by treating those with contempt
whom better fortune animated to rebel against him,
did not fail to raise a great number of enemies in
the different classes of mankind. Those who thought
themselves raised above him by the advantages of
riches, hated him because they found no protection
from the petulance of his wit. Those who were
esteemed for their writings feared him as a critic,
and maligned him as a rival, and almost all the
smaller wits were his professed enemies.</P>
<P>Among these Mr. Millar so far indulged his re∣sentment
as to introduce him in a farce, and direct
him to be personated on the stage in a dress like that
which he then wore; a mean insult, which only insi∣nuated
that Savage had but one coat, and which
was therefore despised by him rather than resented;
for though he wrote a lampoon against Millar, he
never printed it: and as no other person ought to
prosecute that revenge from which the person who
was injured desisted, I shall not preserve what Mr.
Savage suppressed; of which the publication would
indeed have been a punishment too severe for so im∣potent
an assault.</P>
<P>The great hardships of poverty were to Savage not
the want of lodging or of food, but the neglect and
contempt which it drew upon him. He complained
that as his affairs grew desperate, he found his repu∣tation
for capacity visibly decline; that his opinion
in questions of criticism was no longer regarded,
when his coat was out of fashion; and that those who
in the interval of his prosperity were always encou∣raging
him to great undertakings by encomiums on
his genius and assurances of success, now received
any mention of his designs with coldness, thought
that the subjects on which he proposed to write were
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="90"/>
very difficult; and were ready to inform him, that
the event of a poem was uncertain, that an author
ought to employ much time in the consideration of
his plan, and not presume to sit down to write in
confidence of a few cursory ideas, and a superficial
knowledge; difficulties were started on all sides, and
he was no longer qualified for any performance but
THE VOLUNTEER LAUREAT.</P>
<P>Yet even this kind of contempt never depressed
him; for he always preserved a steady confidence in
his own capacity, and believed nothing above his
reach which he should at any time earnestly endea∣vour
to attain. He formed schemes of the same
kind with regard to knowledge and to fortune, and
flattered himself with advances to be made in science,
as with riches to be enjoyed in some distant period of
his life. For the acquisition of knowledge he was
indeed far better qualified than for that of riches;
for he was naturally inquisitive and desirous of the
conversation of those from whom any information
was to be obtained, but by no means solicitous to
improve those opportunities that were sometimes of∣fered
of raising his fortune; and he was remarkably
retentive of his ideas, which, when once he was in
possession of them, rarely forsook him; a quality
which could never be communicated to his money.</P>
<P>While he was thus wearing out his life in expecta∣tion
that the Queen would some time recollect her
promise, he had recourse to the usual practice of
writers, and published proposals for printing his
works by subscription, to which he was encouraged
by the success of many who had not a better right
to the favour of the public; but whatever was the
reason he did not find the world equally inclined to
favour him, and he observed with some discontent,
that though he offered his works at half a guinea,
he was able to procure but a small number in com∣parison
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="91"/>
with those who subscribed twice as much to
Duck.</P>
<P>Nor was it without indignation that he saw his
proposals neglected by the Queen, who patronised
Mr. Duck's with uncommon ardour, and incited a
competition among those who attended the court,
who should most promote his interest, and who should
first offer a subscription. This was a distinction to
which Mr. Savage made no scruple of asserting that
his birth, his misfortunes, and his genius gave him
a fairer title than could be pleaded by him on whom
it was conferred.</P>
<P>Savage's applications were however not universally
unsuccessful; for some of the nobility countenanced
his design, encouraged his proposals, and subscribed
with great liberality. He related of the Duke of
Chandos particularly, that, upon receiving his pro∣posals,
he sent him ten guineas.</P>
<P>But the money which his subscriptions afforded
him was not less volatile than that which he received
from his other schemes; whenever a subscription was
paid him he went to a tavern, and as money so col∣lected
is necessarily received in small sums, he never
was able to send his poems to the press, but for many
years continued his solicitation, and squandered
whatever he obtained.</P>
<P>This project of printing his works was frequently
revived, and as his proposals grew obsolete, new
ones were printed with fresher dates. To form
schemes for the publication was one of his favourite
amusements, nor was he ever more at ease than when
with any friend who readily fell in with his schemes,
he was adjusting the print, forming the advertise∣ments,
and regulating the dispersion of his new edi∣tion,
which he really intended some time to publish,
and which, as long as experience had shewn him the
impossibility of printing the volume together, he at
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="92"/>
last determined to divide into weekly or monthly
numbers, that the profits of the first might supply
the expences of the next.</P>
<P>Thus he spent his time in mean expedients and
tormenting suspense, living for the greatest part in
fear of prosecutions from his creditors, and conse∣quently
skulking in obscure parts of the town, of
which he was no stranger to the remotest corners.
But wherever he came his address secured him friends,
whom his necessities soon alienated, so that he had
perhaps a more numerous acquaintance than any
man ever before attained, there being scarcely any
person eminent on any account to whom he was not
known, or whose character he was not in some de∣gree
able to delineate.</P>
<P>To the acquisition of this extensive acquaintance
every circumstance of his life contributed. He ex∣celled
in the arts of conversation, and therefore
willingly practised them: He had seldom any home,
or even a lodging in which he could be private, and
therefore was driven into public-houses for the com∣mon
conveniences of life, and supports of nature.
He was always ready to comply with every invitation,
having no employment to withhold him, and often
no money to provide for himself; and by dining
with one company, he never failed of obtaining an
introduction into another.</P>
<P>Thus dissipated was his life, and thus casual his
subsistence; yet did not the distraction of his views
hinder him from reflection, nor the uncertainty of
his condition depress his gaiety. When he had
wandered about without any fortunate adventure by
which he was led into a tavern, he sometimes retired
into the fields, and was able to employ his mind in
study, or amuse it with pleasing imaginations; and
seldom appeared to be melancholy, but when some
sudden misfortune had just fallen upon him, and
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="93"/>
even then in a few moments he would disentangle
himself from his perplexity, adopt the subject of
conversation, and apply his mind wholly to the
objects that others presented to it.</P>
<P>This life, unhappy as it may be already imagined,
was yet imbittered in 1738, with new calamities.
The death of the Queen deprived him of all the
prospects of preferment with which he so long enter∣tained
his imagination; and as Sir Robert Walpole
had before given him reason to believe that he never
intended the performance of his promise, he was
now abandoned again to fortune.</P>
<P>He was however, at that time, supported by a
friend; and as it was not his custom to look out for
distant calamities, or to feel any other pain than
that which forced itself upon his senses, he was not
much afflicted at his loss, and perhaps comforted
himself that his pension would be now continued
without the annual tribute of a panegyric.</P>
<P>Another expectation contributed likewise to sup∣port
him: he had taken a resolution to write a second
tragedy upon the story of Sir Thomas Overbury, in
which he preserved a few lines of his former play;
but made a total alteration of the plan, added new
incidents, and introduced new characters; so that it
was a new tragedy, not a revival of the former.</P>
<P>Many of his friends blamed him for not making
choice of another subject; but in vindication of him∣self,
he asserted, that it was not easy to find a better;
and that he thought it his interest to extinguish the
memory of the first tragedy, which he could only do
by writing one less defective upon the same story;
by which he should entirely defeat the artifice of the
booksellers, who after the death of any author of
reputation, are always industrious to swell his works,
by uniting his worst productions with his best.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxix" REF="94"/>
In the execution of this scheme however, he pro∣ceeded
but slowly, and probably only employed him∣self
upon it when he could find no other amusement;
but he pleased himself with counting the profits, and
perhaps imagined, that the theatrical reputation
which he was about to acquire, would be equivalent
to all that he had lost by the death of his patroness.</P>
<P>He did not, in confidence of his approaching
riches, neglect the measures proper to secure the
continuance of his pension, though some of his fa∣vourers
thought him culpable for omitting to write
on her death; but on her birth-day next year, he
gave a proof of the solidity of his judgment, and
the power of his genius. He knew that the track
of elegy had been so long beaten, that it was im∣possible
to travel in it without treading in the foot∣steps
of those who had gone before him; and that
therefore it was necessary, that he might distinguish
himself from the herd of encomiasts, to find out
some new walk of funeral panegyric.</P>
<P>This difficult task he performed in such a manner,
that his poem may be justly ranked among the best
pieces that the death of princes has produced. By
transferring the mention of her death to her birth∣day,
he has formed a happy combination of topics,
which any other man would have thought it very
difficult to connect in one view; but which he has
united in such a manner, that the relation between
them appears natural; and it may be justly said,
that what no other man would have thought on, it
now appears scarcely possible for any man to miss<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The beauty of this peculiar combination of images
is so masterly, that it is sufficient to set this poem
above censure; and therefore it is not necessary to
mention many other delicate touches which may be
<PB N="xc" REF="95"/>
found in it, and which would deservedly be admired
in any other performance.</P>
<P>To these proofs of his genius may be added, from
the same poem, an instance of his prudence, an ex∣cellence
for which he was not so often distinguished;
he does not forget<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 129.</NOTE> to remind the King in the most
delicate and artful manner of continuing his pension.</P>
<P>With regard to the success of this address, he was
for some time in suspense; but was in no great de∣gree
solicitous about it; and continued his labour
upon his new tragedy with great tranquillity, till the
friend, who had for a considerable time supported
him, removing his family to another place, took
occasion to dismiss him. It then became necessary
to enquire more diligently what was determined in
his affair, having reason to suspect that no great
favour was intended him, because he had not re∣ceived
his pension at the usual time.</P>
<P>It is said, that he did not take those methods of
retrieving his interest, which were most likely to
succeed; and some of those who were employed in
the Exchequer, cautioned him against too much
violence in his proceedings; but Mr. Savage, who
seldom regulated his conduct by the advice of others,
gave way to his passion, and demanded of Sir Robert
Walpole, at his levee, the reason of the distinction
that was made between him and the other pensioners
of the Queen, with a degree of roughness, which
perhaps determined him to withdraw what had been
only delayed.</P>
<P>Whatever was the crime of which he was accused
or suspected, and whatever influence was employed
against him, he received soon after an account that
took from him all hopes of regaining his pension;
and he had now no prospect of subsistence but from
his play, and he knew no way of living for the time
required to finish it.</P>
<P><PB N="xci" REF="96"/>
So peculiar were the misfortunes of this man,
deprived of an estate and title by a particular law,
exposed and abandoned by a mother, defrauded by
a mother of a fortune which his father had allotted
him, he entered the world without a friend; and
though his abilities forced themselves into esteem and
reputation, he was never able to obtain any real
advantage, and whatever prospects arose, were always
intercepted as he began to approach them. The
King's intentions in his favour were frustrated; his
Dedication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 229.</NOTE> to the Prince, whose generosity on every
other occasion was eminent, procured him no re∣ward;
Sir Robert Walpole, who valued himself
upon keeping his promise to others, broke it to him
without regret; and the bounty of the Queen was,
after her death, withdrawn from him, and from him
only.</P>
<P>Such were his misfortunes, which yet he bore not
only with decency, but with cheerfulness, nor was
his gaiety clouded even by his last disappointments,
though he was in a short time reduced to the lowest
degree of distress; and often wanted both lodging
and food. At this time he gave another instance of
the insurmountable obstinacy of his spirit: his cloaths
were worn out, and he received notice, that at a
coffee-house some cloaths and linen were left for
him; the person who sent them, did not, I believe,
inform him to whom he was to be obliged, that he
might spare the perplexity of acknowledging the
benefit; but though the offer was so far generous,
it was made with some neglect of ceremonies, which
Mr. Savage so much resented, that he refused the
present, and declined to enter the house, till the
cloaths that had been designed for him were taken
away.</P>
<P>His distress was now publickly known, and his
friends, therefore, thought it proper to concert some
<PB N="xcii" REF="97"/>
measures for his relief; and one of them wrote a
letter to him, in which he expressed his concern “for
the miserable withdrawing of his pension;” and
gave him hopes, that in a short time he should find
himself supplied with a competence, “without any
dependance on those little creatures which we are
pleased to call the Great.”</P>
<P>The scheme proposed for this happy and inde∣pendent
subsistence, was, that he should retire into
Wales, and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a
year, to be raised by a subscription, on which he
was to live privately in a cheap place, without as∣piring
any more to affluence, or having any farther
care of reputation.</P>
<P>This offer Mr. Savage gladly accepted, though
with intentions very different from those of his
friends; for they proposed that he should continue
an exile from London for ever, and spend all the
remaining part of his life at Swansea; but he de∣signed
only to take the opportunity, which their
scheme offered him, of retreating for a short time,
that he might prepare his play for the stage, and his
other works for the press, and then to return to
London to exhibit his tragedy, and live upon the
profits of his own labour.</P>
<P>With regard to his works, he proposed very great
improvements, which would have required much
time, or great application; and when he had finished
them, he designed to do justice to his subscribers,
by publishing them according to his proposals.</P>
<P>As he was ready to entertain himself with future
pleasures, he had planned out a scheme of life for
the country, of which he had no knowledge but
from pastorals and songs. He imagined that he
should be transported to scenes of flowery felicity,
like those which one poet has reflected to another,
<PB N="xciii" REF="98"/>
and had projected a perpetual round of innocent
pleasures, of which he suspected no interruption
from pride, or ignorance, or brutality.</P>
<P>With these expectations he was so enchanted, that
when he was once gently reproached by a friend for
submitting to live upon a subscription, and advised
rather by a resolute exertion of his abilities to sup∣port
himself, he could not bear to debar himself
from the happiness which was to be found in the
calm of a cottage, or lose the opportunity of listen∣ing,
without intermission, to the melody of the
nightingale, which he believed was to be heard from
every bramble, and which he did not fail to mention
as a very important part of the happiness of a country
life.</P>
<P>While this scheme was ripening, his friends di∣rected
him to take a lodging in the liberties of the
Fleet, that he might be secure from his creditors,
and sent him every Monday a guinea, which he
commonly spent before the next morning, and trusted,
after his usual manner, the remaining part of the
week to the bounty of fortune.</P>
<P>He now began very sensibly to feel the miseries of
dependance: Those by whom he was to be sup∣ported,
began to prescribe to him with an air of
authority, which he knew not how decently to resent,
nor patiently to bear; and he soon discovered from
the conduct of most of his subscribers, that he was
yet in the hands of “Little creatures.”</P>
<P>Of the insolence that he was obliged to suffer, he
gave many instances, of which none appeared to
raise his indignation to a greater height, than the
method which was taken of furnishing him with
cloaths. Instead of consulting him, and allowing
him to send a tailor his orders for what they thought
proper to allow him, they proposed to send for a
<PB N="xciv" REF="99"/>
tailor to take his measure, and then to consult how
they should equip him.</P>
<P>This treatment was not very delicate, nor was it
such as Savage's humanity would have suggested to
him on a like occasion; but it had scarcely deserved
mention, had it not, by affecting him in an uncom∣mon
degree, shewn the peculiarity of his character.
Upon hearing the design that was formed, he came
to the lodging of a friend with the most violent
agonies of rage; and being asked what it could be
that gave him such disturbance, he replied with the
utmost vehemence of indignation, “That they had
sent for a tailor to measure him.”</P>
<P>How the affair ended was never enquired, for fear
of renewing his uneasiness. It is probable, that,
upon recollection, he submitted with a good grace
to what he could not avoid, and that he discovered
no resentment where he had no power.</P>
<P>He was, however, not humbled to implicit and
universal compliance; for when the gentleman, who
had first informed him of the design to support him
by a subscription, attempted to procure a recon∣ciliation
with the Lord Tyrconnel, he could by no
means be prevailed upon to comply with the mea∣sures
that were proposed.</P>
<P>A letter was written for him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Mr. Pope,</NOTE> to Sir William Le∣mon,
to prevail upon him to interpose his good
offices with Lord Tyrconnel, in which he solicited
Sir William's assistance, “for a man who really
needed it as much as any man could well do;”
and informed him, that he was retiring “for ever to
a place where he should no more trouble his rela∣tions,
friends, or enemies;” he confessed, that his
passion had betrayed him to some conduct with regard
to Lord Tyrconnel, “for which he could not but
<PB N="xcv" REF="100"/>
heartily ask his pardon;” and as he imagined Lord
Tyrconnel's passion might be yet so high, that he
would not “receive a letter from him,” begged that
Sir William would endeavour to soften him; and
expressed his hopes that he would comply with his
request, and that “so small a relation would not
harden his heart against him.”</P>
<P>That any man should presume to dictate a letter
to him, was not very agreeable to Mr. Savage; and
therefore he was, before he had opened it, not much
inclined to approve it. But when he read it, he
found it contained sentiments entirely opposite to his
own; and, as he asserted, to the truth; and there∣fore
instead of copying it, wrote his friend a letter
full of masculine resentment and warm expostula∣tions.
He very justly observed, that the style was
too supplicatory, and the representation too abject,
and that he ought at least to have made him com∣plain
with “the dignity of a gentleman in distress.”
He declared that he would not write the paragraph
in which he was to ask Lord Tyrconnel's pardon;
for “he despised his pardon, and therefore could not
heartily, and would not hypocritically, ask it.” He
remarked, that his friend made a very unreasonable
distinction between himself and him; for, says he,
when you mention men of high rank “in your own
character,” they are “those little creatures whom
we are pleased to call the great;” but when you
address them “in mine,” no servility is sufficiently
humble. He then with great propriety explained
the ill consequences which might be expected from
such a letter, which his relations would print in their
own defence, and which would for ever be produced
as a full answer to all that he should allege against
them; for he always intended to publish a minute
account of the treatment which he had received. It
is to be remembered, to the honour of the gentle∣man
<PB N="xcvi" REF="101"/>
by whom this letter was drawn up, that he
yielded to Mr. Savage's reasons, and agreed that it
ought to be suppressed.</P>
<P>After many alterations and delays, a subscription
was at length raised which did not amount to fifty
pounds a year, though twenty were paid by one gen∣tleman;
such was the generosity of mankind, that
what had been done by a player without solicitation,
could not now be effected by application and interest;
and Savage had a great number to court and to obey
for a pension less than that which Mrs. Oldfield paid
him without exacting any servilities.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however was satisfied, and willing to
retire, and was convinced that the allowance, though
scanty, would be more than sufficient for him, being
now determined to commence a rigid economist, and
to live according to the exactest rules of frugality;
for nothing was in his opinion more contemptible
than a man, who, when he knew his income, exceeded
it; and yet he confessed, that instances of such folly
were too common, and lamented that some men were
not to be trusted with their own money.</P>
<P>Full of these salutary resolutions, he left London
in July 1739, having taken leave with great tender∣ness
of his friends, and parted from the author of
this narrative with tears in his eyes. He was fur∣nished
with fifteen guineas, and informed, that they
would be sufficient, not only for the expence of his
journey, but for his support in Wales for some time;
and that there remained but little more of the first
collection. He promised a strict adherence to his
maxims of parsimony, and went away in the stage∣coach;
nor did his friends expect to hear from him,
till he informed them of his arrival at Swansea.</P>
<P>But when they least expected, arrived a letter
dated the fourteenth day after his departure, in
which he sent them word, that he was yet upon the
<PB N="xcvii" REF="102"/>
road, and without money; and that he therefore
could not proceed without a remittance. They then
sent him the money that was in their hands, with
which he was enabled to reach Bristol, from whence
he was to go to Swansea by water.</P>
<P>At Bristol he found an embargo laid upon the
shipping, so that he could not immediately obtain a
pasiage; and being therefore obliged to stay there
some time, he, with his usual felicity, ingratiated
himself with many of the principal inhabitants, was
invited to their houses, distinguished at their public
seasts, and treated with a regard that gratified his
vanity, and therefore easily engaged his affection.</P>
<P>He began very early after his retirement to com∣plain
of the conduct of his friends in London, and
irritated many of them so much by his letters, that
they withdrew, however honourably, their contri∣butions;
and it is believed, that little more was
paid him than the twenty pounds a year, which were
allowed him by the gentleman who proposed the
subscription.</P>
<P>After some stay at Bristol he retired to Swansea,
the place originally proposed for his residence, where
he lived about a year very much dissatisfied with the
diminution of his salary; but contracted, as in other
places, acquaintance with those who were most dis∣tinguished
in that country, among whom he has
celebrated Mr. Powel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 217.</NOTE> and Mrs. Jones<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197.</NOTE>, by some
verses which he inserted in THE GENTLEMAN'S
MAGAZINE.</P>
<P>Here he completed his tragedy, of which two acts
were wanting when he left London, and was de∣sirous
of coming to town to bring it upon the stage.
This design was very warmly opposed, and he was
advised by his chief benefactor to put it into the
hands of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Mallet, that it
<PB N="xcviii" REF="103"/>
might be fitted for the stage, and to allow his friends
to receive the profits, out of which an annual pen∣sion
should be paid him.</P>
<P>This proposal he rejected with the utmost con∣tempt.
He was by no means convinced that the
judgment of those to whom he was required to sub∣mit,
was superior to his own. He was now deter∣mined,
as he expressed it, to be “no longer kept in
leading-strings,” and had no elevated idea of “his
bounty,” who proposed to “pension him out of the
profits his own labours.”</P>
<P>He attempted in Wales to promote a subscription
for his works, and had once hopes of success; but
in a short time afterwards formed a resolution of
leaving that part of the country, to which he thought
it not reasonable to be confined for the gratification
of those, who, having promised him a liberal income,
had no sooner banished him to a remote corner, than
they reduced his allowance to a salary scarcely equal
to the necessities of life.</P>
<P>His resentment of this treatment, which, in his
own opinion at least, he had not deserved, was such,
that he broke off all correspondence with most of his
contributors, and appeared to consider them as per∣secutors
and oppressors; and in the latter part of his
life declared, that their conduct toward him, since
his departure from London, “had been persidious∣ness
improving on per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idiousness, and inhumanity
on inhumanity.”</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed, that the necessities of Mr.
Savage did not sometimes incite him to satirical ex∣aggerations
of the behaviour of those by whom he
thought himself reduced to them. But it must be
granted, that the diminution of his allowance was a
great hardship, and that those who withdrew their
subscription from a man, who, upon the faith of
their promise, had gone into a kind of banishment,
<PB N="xcix" REF="104"/>
and abandoned all those by whom he had been be∣fore
relieved in his distresses, will find it no easy task
to vindicate their conduct.</P>
<P>It may be alleged, and perhaps justly, that he was
petulant and contemptuous, that he more frequently
reproached his subscribers for not giving him more,
than thanked them for what he received; but it is
to be remembered, that this conduct, and this is the
worst charge that can be drawn up against him, did
them no real injury; and that it therefore ought ra∣ther
to have been pitied than resented, at least the
resentment it might provoke ought to have been ge∣nerous
and manly; epithets which his conduct will
hardly deserve that starves the man whom he has
persuaded to put himself into his power.</P>
<P>It might have been reasonably demanded by Sa∣vage,
that they should, before they had taken away
what they promised, have replaced him in his former
state, that they should have taken no advantages
from the situation to which the appearance of their
kindness had reduced him, and that he should have
been recalled to London before he was abandoned.
He might justly represent, that he ought to have
been considered as a lion in the toils, and demand
to be released before the dogs should be loosed upon
him.</P>
<P>He endeavoured, indeed, to release himself, and
with an intent to return to London, went to Bristol,
where a repetition of the kindness which he had for∣merly
found, invited him to stay. He was not only
caressed and created, but had a collection made for
him of about thirty pounds, with which it had been
happy if he had immediately departed for London;
but his negligence did not suffer him to consider,
that such proofs of kindness were not often to be ex∣pected,
and that this ardour of benevolence was in a
great degree the effect of novelty, and might, pro∣bably,
<PB N="c" REF="105"/>
be every day less; and therefore he took no
care to improve the happy time, but was encouraged
by one favour to hope for another, till at length ge∣nerosity
was exhausted, and officiousness wearied.</P>
<P>Another part of his misconduct was the practice of
prolonging his visits to unseasonable hours, and dis∣concerting
all the families into which he was admit∣ted.
This was an error in a place of commerce
which all the charms of his conversation could not
compensate; for what trader would purchase such
airy satisfaction by the loss of solid gain, which must
be the consequence of midnight merriment, as those
hours which were gained at night were generally lost
in the morning?</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Savage, after the curiosity of the inha∣bitants
was gratified, found the number of his friends
daily decreasing, perhaps without suspecting for what
reason their conduct was altered; for he still conti∣nued
to harrass, with his nocturnal intrusions, those
that yet countenanced him, and admitted him to
their houses.</P>
<P>But he did not spend all the time of his residence
at Bristol in visits or at taverns, for he sometimes re∣turned
to his studies, and began several considerable
designs. When he felt an inclination to write, he
always retired from the knowledge of his friends,
and lay hid in an obseure part of the suburbs, till he
sound himself again desirous of company, to which
it is likely that intervals of absence made him more
welcome.</P>
<P>He was always full of his design of returning to
London to bring his tragedy upon the stage; but
having neglected to depart with the money that was
raised for him, he could not afterwards procure a
sum sufficient to defray the expences of his journey;
nor perhaps would a fresh supply have had any other
effect, than, by putting immediate pleasures in his
<PB N="ci" REF="106"/>
power, to have driven the thoughts of his journey
out of his mind.</P>
<P>While he was thus spending the day in contriving
a scheme for the morrow, distress stole upon him by
imperceptible degrees. His conduct had already
wearied some of those who were at first enamoured
of his conversation; but he might, perhaps, still
have devolved to others, whom he might have enter∣tained
with equal success, had not the decay of his
cloaths made it no longer consistent with their vanity
to admit him to their tables, or to associate with him
in public places. He now began to find every man from
home at whose house he called; and was therefore no
longer able to procure the necessaries of life, but
wandered about the town slighted and neglected in
quest of a dinner which he did not always obtain.</P>
<P>To complete his misery he was pursued by the
officers for small debt; which he had contracted; and
was therefore obliged to withdraw from the small
number of friends from whom he had still reason to
hope for favours. His custom was to lie in bed the
greatest part of the day, and to go out in the dark
with the utmost privacy, and after having paid his
visit return again before morning to his lodging,
which was in the garret of an obscure inn.</P>
<P>Being thus excluded on one hand, and confined
on the other, he suffered the utmost extremities of
poverty, and often fasted so long that he was seized
with faintness, and had lost his appetite, not being
able to bear the smell of meat, till the action of his
stomach was restored by a cordial.</P>
<P>In this distress he received a remittance of five
pounds from London, with which he provided him∣self
a decent coat, and determined to go to London,
but unhappily spent his money at a favourite tavern.
Thus was he again confined to Bristol, where he was
every day hunted by bailiffs. In this exigence he
<PB N="cii" REF="107"/>
once more found a friend, who sheltered him in his
house, though at the usual inconveniences with which
his company was attended; for he could neither be
persuaded to go to bed in the night, nor to rise in
the day.</P>
<P>It is observable, that in these various scenes of
misery, he was always disengaged and cheerful: he
at some times pursued his studies, and at others con∣tinued
or enlarged his epistolary correspondence, nor
was he ever so far dejected as to endeavour to procure
an increase of his allowance by any other methods
than accusations and reproaches.</P>
<P>He had now no longer any hopes of assistance from
his friends at Bristol, who as merchants, and by con∣sequence
sufficiently studious of profit, cannot be
supposed to have looked with much compassion upon
negligence and extravagance, or to think any excel∣lence
equivalent to a fault of such consequence as
neglect of economy. It is natural to imagine, that
many of those who would have relieved his real
wants, were discouraged from the exertion of their
benevolence by observation of the use which was
made of their favours, and conviction that relief
would only be momentary, and that the same neces∣sity
would quickly return.</P>
<P>At last he quitted the house of his friend, and
returned to his lodging at the inn, still intending to
set out in a few days for London; but on the 10th
of January 1742-3, having been at supper with two
of his friends, he was at his return to his lodgings
arrested for a debt of about eight pounds, which he
owed at a coffee-house, and conducted to the house
of a sheriff's officer. The account which he gives
of this misfortune, in a letter to one of the gentlemen
with whom he had supped, is too remarkable to be
omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="ciii" REF="108"/>
“It was not a little unfortunate for me, that I
spent yesterday's evening with you; because the
hour hindered me from entering on my new lodg∣ing;
however, I have now got one, but such an
one, as I believe nobody would chuse.</P>
<P>“I was arrested at the suit of Mrs. Read, just as I
was going up stairs to bed, at Mr. Bowyer's; but
taken in so private a manner, that I believe nobody
at the White Lion is apprised of it. Though I let
the officers know the strength (or rather weakness)
of my pocket, yet they treated me with the utmost
civility, and even when they conducted me to con∣finement,
it was in such a manner, that I verily
believe I could have escaped, which I would rather
be ruined than have done, notwithstanding the
whole amount of my finances was but three pence
halfpenny.</P>
<P>“In the first place I must insist, that you will in∣dustriously
conceal this from Mrs. S—s, because
I would not have her goodnature suffer that pain,
which, I know, she would be apt to feel on this
occasion.</P>
<P>“Next, I conjure you, dear Sir, by all the ties of
friendship, by no means to have one uneasy thought
on my account; but to have the same pleasantry
of countenance and unruffled serenity of mind,
which (God be praised!) I have in this, and have
had in a much severer calamity. Furthermore, I
charge you, if you value my friendship as truly as
I do yours, not to utter or even harbour the least
resentment against Mrs. Read. I believe she has
ruined me, but I freely forgive her; and (though
I will never more have any intimacy with her)
would, at a due distance, rather do her an act of
good, than ill will. Lastly (pardon the expression),
I absolutely command you not to osser me any pe∣cuniary
assistance, nor to attempt getting me any
from any one of your friends. At another time,
<PB N="civ" REF="109"/>
or on any other occasion, you may, dear friend, be
well assured, I would rather write to you in the
submissive style of a request, than that of a peremp∣tory
command.</P>
<P>“However, that my truly valuable friend may not
think I am too proud to ask a favour, let me en∣treat
you to let me have your boy to attend me for
this day, not only for the sake of saving me the
expence of porters, but for the delivery of some
letters to people whose names I would not have
known to strangers.</P>
<P>“The civil treatment I have thus far met from
those, whose prisoner I am, makes me thankful to
the Almighty, that, though he has thought fit to
visit me (on my birth-night) with affliction, yet
(such is his great goodness!) my affliction is not
without alleviating circumstances. I murmur not,
but am all resignation to the divine will. As to
the world, I hope that I shall be endued by heaven
with that presence of mind, that serene dignity
in misfortune, that constitutes the character of a
true nobleman; a dignity far beyond that of coro∣nets;
a nobility arising from the just principles of
philosophy, refined and exalted by those of christi∣anity.”—</P>
<P>He continued five days at the officer's, in hopes
that he should be able to procure bail, and avoid the
necessity of going to prison. The state in which he
passed his time, and the treatment which he received,
are very justly expressed by him in a letter which he
wrote to a friend: “The whole day,” says he, “has
been employed in various peoples” filling my head
with their foolish chimerical systems, which has
obliged me coolly (as far as nature will admit) to
digest, and accommodate myself to, every different
person's way of thinking; hurried from one wild
system to another, till it has quite made a chaos of
my imagination, and nothing done—promised—
<PB N="cv" REF="110"/>
disappointed—ordered to send every hour, from
one part of the town to the other.”—</P>
<P>When his friends, who had hitherto caressed and
applauded, found that to give bail and pay the debt
was the same, they all refused to preserve him from
a prison, at the expence of eight pounds; and there∣fore
after having been for some time at the officer's
house, “at an immense expence,” as he observes in his
letter, he was at length removed to Newgate.</P>
<P>This expence he was enabled to support by the
generosity of Mr. Nash at Bath, who, upon receiving
from him an account of his condition, immediately
sent him five guineas, and promised to promote his
subscription at Bath with all his interest.</P>
<P>By his removal to Newgate, he obtained at least
a freedom from suspense, and rest from the disturb∣ing
vicissitudes of hope and disappointment; he now
found that his friends were only companions, who
were willing to share his gaiety, but not to partake
of his misfortunes; and therefore he no longer ex∣pected
any assistance from them.</P>
<P>It must however be observed of one gentleman,
that he offered to release him by paying the debt,
but that Mr. Savage would not consent, I suppose,
because he thought he had been before too burthen∣some
to him.</P>
<P>He was offered by some of his friends, that a col∣lection
should be made for his enlargement, but he
treated the proposal,” and declared,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter after his confinement.</NOTE> “that he
should again treat it, with disdain. As to writing
any mendicant letters, he had too high a spirit,
and determined only to write to some ministers of
state, to try to regain his pension.”</P>
<P>He continued to complain<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Letter January 15.</NOTE> of those that had sent
him into the country, and objected to them, that he
had “lost the profits of his play which had been
<PB N="cvi" REF="111"/>
finished three years;” and in another letter declare;
his resolution to publish a pamphlet, that the world
might know how “he had been used.”</P>
<P>This pamphlet was never written, for he in a very
short time recovered his usual tranquillity, and cheer∣fully
applied himself to more inoffensive studies. He
indeed steadily declared, that he was promised a
yearly allowance of fifty pounds, and never received
half the sum; but he seemed to resign himself to that
as well as to other misfortunes, and lose the remem∣brance
of it in his amusements and employments.</P>
<P>The cheerfulness with which he bore his confine∣ment,
appears from the following letter which he
wrote January the 30th to one of his friends in
London:</P>
<P>“I now write to you from my confinement in New∣gate,
where I have been ever since Monday last
was se'en-night, and where I enjoy myself with
much more tranquillity than I have known for up∣wards
of a twelvemonth past; having a room en∣tirely
to myself, and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suing the amusement of
my poetical studies, uninterrupted and agreeable to
my mind. I thank the Almighty, I am now all
collected in myself, and though my person is in
confinement, my mind can expatiate on ample and
useful subjects with all the freedom imaginable. I
am now more conversant with the Nine than ever;
and if, instead of a Newgate-bird, I may be al∣lowed
to be a bird of the Muses, I assure you, Sir,
I sing very freely in my cage; sometimes indeed
in the plaintive notes of the nightingale; but, at
others, in the cheerful strains of the lark.”—</P>
<P>In another letter he observes, that he ranges from
one subject to another, without confining himself to
any particular task, and that he was employed one
week upon one attempt, and the next upon another.</P>
<P>Surely the fortitude of this man deserves, at least,
to be mentioned with applause; and whatever faults
<PB N="cvii" REF="112"/>
may be imputed to him, the virtue of suffering well
cannot be denied him. The two powers which, in
the opinion of Epictetus, constituted a wise man,
are those of bearing and forbearing, which cannot
indeed be affirmed to have been equally possessed by
Savage; and indeed the want of one obliged him
very frequently to practise the other.</P>
<P>He was treated by Mr. Dag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the keeper of the
prison, with great humanity; was supported by him
at his own table without any certainty of recom∣pense,
had a room to himself, to which he could at
any time retire from all disturbance, was allowed to
stand at the door of the prison, and sometimes taken
out into the fields; so that he suffered sewer hard∣ships
in prison, than he had been accustomed to
undergo in the greatest part of his life.</P>
<P>The keeper did not confine his benevolence to a
gentle execution of his office, but made some over∣tures
to the creditor for his release, but without
effect; and continued, during the whole time of
his imprisonment, to treat him with the utmost ten∣derness
and civility.</P>
<P>Virtue is undoubtedly most laudable in that state
which makes it most difficult; and therefore the
humanity of a gaoler certainly deserves this public
attestation; and the man, whose heart has not been
hardened by such an employment, may be justly
proposed as a pattern of benevolence. If an in∣scription
was once engraved to the “honest toll∣gatherer,”
less honours ought not to be paid “to
the tender gaoler.”</P>
<P>Mr. Savage very frequently received visits, and
sometimes presents from his acquaintances, but they
did not amount to a subsistence, for the greater part
of which he was indebted to the generosity of this
keeper; but these favours, however they might
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndear to him the particular persons from whom he
received them, were very far from impressing upon
<PB N="cviii" REF="113"/>
his mind any advantageous ideas of the people of
Bristol, and therefore he thought he could not more
properly employ himself in prison, than in writing
a poem called “London and Bristol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 231.</NOTE> delineated.”</P>
<P>When he had brought this poem to its present
state, which, without considering the chasm, is not
perfect, he wrote to London an account of his de∣sign,
and informed his friend, that he was deter∣mined
to print it with his name; but enjoined him
not to communicate his intention to his Bristol ac∣quaintance.
The gentleman, surprised at his reso∣lution,
endeavoured to dissuade him from publishing
it, at least from prefixing his name, and declared,
that he could not reconcile the injunction of secrecy
with his resolution to own it at its first appearance.
To this Mr. Savage returned an answer agreeable to
his character in the following terms.</P>
<P>“I received yours this morning, and not without
a little surprize at the contents. To answer a
question with a question, you ask me concerning
London and Bristol, Why will I add delineated?
Why did Mr. Woolaston add the same word to his
RELIGION OF NATURE? I suppose that it was
his will and pleasure to add it in his case; and it
is mine to do so in my own. You are pleased to
tell me, that you understand not why secrecy is
enjoined, and yet I intend to set my name to it.
My answer is—I have my private reasons, which
I am not obliged to explain to any one. You
doubt my friend Mr. S—would not approve
of it—And what is it to me whether he does or
not? Do you imagine that Mr. S—is to dictate
to me? If any man, who calls himself my friend,
should assume such an air, I would spurn at his
friendship with contempt. You say I seem to
think so by not letting him know it—And suppose
I do, what then? Perhaps I can give reasons for
<PB N="cix" REF="114"/>
that disapprobation, very foreign from what you
would imagine. You go on in saying, Suppose I
should not put my name to it—My answer is, that
I will not suppose any such thing, being deter∣mined
to the contrary; neither, Sir, would I have
you suppose, that I applied to you for want of
another press: Nor would I have you imagine,
that I owe Mr. S—obligations which I do
not.”</P>
<P>Such was his imprudence, and such his obstinate
adherence to his own resolutions, however absurd.
A prisoner! supported by charity! and, whatever
insults he might have received during the latter part
of his stay in Bristol, once caressed, esteemed, and
presented with a liberal collection, he could forget
on a sudden his danger and his obligations, to gra∣tify
the petulance of his wit, or the eagerness of his
resentment, and published a satire, by which he
might reasonably expect, that he should alienate
those who then supported him, and provoke those
whom he could neither resist nor escape.</P>
<P>This resolution, from the execution of which, it
is probable, that only his death could have hindered
him, is sufficient to shew, how much he disregarded
all considerations that opposed his present passions,
and how readily he hazarded all future advantages
for any immediate gratifications. Whatever was his
predominant inclination, neither hope nor fear hin∣dered
him from complying with it, nor had oppo∣sition
any other effect than to heighten his ardour,
and irritate his vehemence.</P>
<P>This performance was however laid aside, while
he was employed in soliciting assistance from several
great persons, and one interruption succeeding ano∣ther,
hindered him from supplying the chasm, and
perhaps from retouching the other parts, which he
can hardly be imagined to have finished, in his own
opinion; for it is very unequal, and some of the
<PB N="cx" REF="115"/>
lines are rather inserted to rhyme to others, than to
support or improve the sense; but the first and last
parts are worked up with great spirit and elegance.</P>
<P>His time was spent in the prison for the most part
in study, or in receiving visits; but sometimes he
descended to lower amusements, and diverted him∣self
in the kitchen with the conversation of the cri∣minals;
for it was not pleasing to him to be much
without company, and though he was very capable
of a judicious choice, he was often contented with
the first that offered: for this he was sometimes re∣proved
by his friends, who found him surrounded
with felons; but the reproof was on that, as on
other occasions, thrown away; he continued to gra∣tify
himself, and to set very little value on the opi∣nion
of others.</P>
<P>But here, as in every other scene of his life, he
made use of such opportunities as occurred of be∣nefiting
those who were more miserable than himself;
and was always ready to perform any offices of hu∣manity
to his fellow-prisoners.</P>
<P>He had now ceased from corresponding with any
of his subscribers except one, who yet continued to
remit him the twenty pounds a year which he had
promised him, and by whom it was expected, that
he would have been in a very short time enlarged,
because he had directed the keeper to enquire after
the state of his debts.</P>
<P>However, he took care to enter his name accord∣ing
to the forms of the court, that the creditor might
be obliged to make him some allowance, if he was
continued a prisoner, and when on that occasion he
appeared in the hall was treated with very unusual
respect.</P>
<P>But the resentment of the city was afterwards raised
by some accounts that had been spread of the satire,
and he was informed that some of the merchants
intended to pay the allowance which the law re∣quired,
<PB N="cxi" REF="116"/>
and to detain him a prisoner at their own
expence. This he treated as an empty menace, and
perhaps might have hastened the publication, only
to shew how much he was superior to their insults,
had not all his schemes been suddenly destroyed.</P>
<P>When he had been six months in prison, he re∣ceived
from one of his friends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope.</NOTE>, in whose kindness
he had the greatest confidence, and on whose assis∣tance
he chiefly depended, a letter, that contained
a charge of very atrocious ingratitude, drawn up in
such terms as sudden resentment dictated. Mr. Sa∣vage
returned a very solemn protestation of his in∣nocence,
but however appeared much disturbed at
the accusation. Some days afterwards he was seized
with a pain in his back and side, which, as it was
not violent, was not suspected to be dangerous; but
growing daily more languid and dejected, on the
25th of July he confined himself to his room, and
a sever seized his spirits. The symptoms grew every
day more formidable, but his condition did not
enable him to procure any assistance. The last time
that the keeper saw him was on July the 31st<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>, when
Savage, seeing him at his bed-side, said, with an
uncommon earnestness, “I have something to say to
you, Sir;” but, after a pause, moved his hand in
a melancholy manner, and finding himself unable
to recollect what he was going to communicate, said,
“'Tis gone!” The keeper soon after left him, and
the next morning he died. He was buried in the
church-yard of St. Peter, at the expence of the
keeper.</P>
<P>Such were the life and death of Richard Savage,
a man equally distinguished by his virtues and vices,
and at once remarkable for his weaknesses and abi∣lities.</P>
<P>He was of a middle stature, of a thin habit of
body, a long visage, coarse features, and melancholy
<PB N="cxii" REF="117"/>
aspect; of a grave and manly deportment, a solemn
dignity of mien; but which, upon a nearer ac∣quaintance,
softened into an engaging easiness of
manners. His walk was slow, and his voice tre∣mulous
and mournful. He was easily excited to
smiles, but very seldom provoked to laughter.</P>
<P>His mind was in an uncommon degree vigorous
and active. His judgment was accurate, his appre∣hension
quick, and his memory so tenacious, that
he was frequently observed to know what he had
learned from others in a short time, better than those
by whom he was informed, and could frequently
recollect incidents, with all their combination of
circumstances, which few would have regarded at
the present time, but which the quickness of his
apprehension impressed upon him. He had the pe∣culiar
felicity, that his attention never deserted him:
he was present to every object, and regardful of the
most trisling occurrences. He had the art of escaping
from his own reflections, and accommodating himself
to every new scene.</P>
<P>To this quality is to be imputed the extent of his
knowledge, compared with the small time which he
spent in visible endeavours to acquire it. He mingled
in cursory conversation with the same steadiness of
attention as others apply to a lecture, and, amidst
the appearance of thoughtless gaiety, lost no new
idea that was started, nor any hint that could be
improved. He had therefore made in coffee-house<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the same pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iciency as in other studies; and it is
remarkable, that the writings of a man of little
education and little reading have an air of learning
scarcely to be found in any other performances, but
which perhaps as often obscures as embellishes them.</P>
<P>His judgement was eminently exact both with re∣gard
to writings and to men. The knowledge of
life was indeed his chief attainment, and it is not
without some satisfaction, that I can produce the
<PB N="cxiii" REF="118"/>
suffrage of Savage in favour of human nature, of
which he never appeared to entertain such odious
ideas, as some, who perhaps had neither his judgment
nor experience, have published, eitherin oftentation
of their sagacity, vindication of their crimes, or
gratification of their malice.</P>
<P>His method of life particularly qualified him for
conversation, of which he knew how to practise all
the graces. He was never vehement or loud, but
at once modest and easy, open and respectful; his
language was vivacious and elegant, and equally
happy upon grave or humorous subjects. He was
generally censured for not knowing when to retire,
but that was not the defect of his judgment, but of
his fortune; when he left his company, he was fre∣quently
to spend the remaining part of the night in
the street, or at least was abandoned to gloomy re∣flections,
which it is not strange that he delayed as
long as he could, and sometimes forgot that he gave
others pain to avoid it himself.</P>
<P>It cannot be said, that he made use of his abilities
for the direction of his own conduct: an irregular
and dissipated manner of life had made him the slave
of every passion that happened to be excited by the
presence of its object, and that slavery to his pas∣sions
reciprocally produced a life irregular and dis∣sipated.
He was not master of his own motions
nor could promise any thing for the next day.</P>
<P>With regard to his economy, nothing can be
added to the relation of his life: He appeared to
think himself born to be supported by others, and
dispensed from all necessity of providing for himself;
he therefore never prosecuted any scheme of advan∣tage,
nor endeavoured even to secure the profits
which his writings might have afforded him.</P>
<P>His temper was, in consequence of the dominion
of his passions, uncertain and capricious; he was
easily engaged, and easily disgusted; but he is ac∣cused
<PB N="cxiv" REF="119"/>
of retaining his hatred more tenaciously than
his benevolence.</P>
<P>He was compassionate both by nature and principle,
and always ready to perform offices of humanity;
but when he was provoked, and very small offences
were sufficient to provoke him, he would prosecute
his revenge with the utmost acrimony till his passion
had subsided.</P>
<P>His friendship was therefore of little value; for
though he was zealous in the support or vindication
of those whom he loved, yet it was always dan∣gerous
to trust him, because he considered himself
as discharged by the first quarrel from all ties of
honour or gratitude; and would betray those secrets,
which, in the warmth of confidence, had been im∣parted
to him. This practice drew upon him an
universal accusation of ingratitude; nor can it be
denied that he was very ready to set himself free
from the load of an obligation; for he could not
bear to conceive himself in a stat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of dependance,
his pride being equally powerful with his other pas∣sions,
and appearing in the form of insolence at one
time, and of vanity at another. Vanity, the most
innocent species of pride, was most frequently pre∣dominant:
He could not easily leave off, when he
had once began to mention himself, or his works;
nor ever read his verses without stealing his eyes
from the page, to discover, in the faces of his audi∣ence,
how they were affected with any favourite
passage.</P>
<P>A kinder name than that of vanity ought to be
given to the delicacy with which he was always care∣ful
to separate his own merit from every other man's,
and to reject that praise to which he had no claim.
He did not forget, in mentioning his performances,
to mark every line that had been suggested or amend∣ed,
and was so accurate, as to relate that he owed
<PB N="cxv" REF="120"/>
three words in THE WANDERER to the advice of
his friends.</P>
<P>His veracity was questioned, but with little reason;
his accounts, though not indeed always the same, were
generally consistent. When he loved any man, he
suppressed all his faults; and when he had been
offended by him, concealed all his virtues: But his
characters were generally true, so far as he pro∣ceeded;
though it cannot be denied, that his partiality
might have sometimes the effect of falsehood.</P>
<P>In cases indifferent he was zealous for virtue, truth,
and justice: he knew very well the necessity of good∣ness
to the present and future happiness of man∣kind;
nor is there perhaps any writer, who has less
endeavoured to please by flattering the appetites, or
perverting the judgment.</P>
<P>As an author, therefore, and he now ceases to
influence mankind in any other character, if one
piece which he had resolved to suppress be excepted,
he has very little to fear from the strictest moral or
religious censure. And though he may not be alto∣gether
secure against the objections of the critic, it
must however be acknowledged, that his works are
the productions of a genius truly poetical; and,
what many writers who have been more lavishly
applauded cannot boast, that they have an original
air, which has no resemblance of any foregoing
writer; that the versification and sentiments have a
cast peculiar to themselves, which no man can imi∣tate
would in another be affectation. It must be con∣fessed
with success, because what was nature in Savage,
that his descriptions are striking, his images
animated, his fictions justly imagined, and his alle∣gories
artfully pursued; that his diction is elevated,
though sometimes forced, and his numbers sonorous
and majestic, though frequently sluggish and en∣cumbered.
Of his style the general fault is harsh∣ness,
and its general excellence is dignity; of his
<PB N="cxvi" REF="121"/>
sentiments the prevailing beauty is sublimity, and
uniformity the prevailing defect.</P>
<P>For his life, or for his writings, none, who can∣didly
consider his fortune, will think an apology
either necessary or difficult. If he was not always
sufficiently instructed in his subject, his knowledge
was at least greater than could have been attained
by others in the same state. If his works were some∣times
unfinished, accuracy cannot reasonably be ex∣acted
from a man oppressed with want, which he
has no hope of relieving, but by a speedy publica∣tion.
The insolence and resentment of which he is
accused, were not easily to be avoided by a great
mind, irritated by perpetual hardships, and con∣strained
hourly to return the spurns of contempt,
and repress the insolence of prosperity; and vanity
may surely readily be pardoned in him, to whom
life afforded no other comforts than barren praises,
and the consciousness of deserving them.</P>
<P>Those are no proper judges of his conduct, who
have slumbered away their time on the down of
assluence; nor will any wise man presume to say,
“Had I been in Savage's condition, I should have
lived or written better than Savage.”</P>
<P>This relation will not be wholly without its use,
if those, who languish under any part of his suf∣ferings,
shall be enabled to fortify their patience,
by reflecting that they feel only those afflictions from
which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him;
or those, who, in confidence of superior capacities
or attainments, disregard the common maxims of
life, shall be reminded that nothing will supply the
want of prudence; and that negligence and irre∣gularity,
long continued, will make knowledge
useless, wit ridiculous, and genius contemptible.</P>

<P>I am afraid, Madam, that he knows some of

cautious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard that a Spanish woman can't have
an amour, but some jealous-pated father or brother
must interfere with the honour of his family. Now
I have heard, that the English women may take
what diversion they please, and be rather celebrated
<PB N="18" REF="138"/>
for their beauty, than censur'd.—Nay, that the very
wives may have a whole equipage of lovers, and be
the more admired by their husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the nature of the climate, Madam; as
in France the coquet is rather admir'd for her airs,
than censur'd for her inclinations. Not but there's
detraction in both climates; but there 'tis a pleasure
peculiar to the women, where scandal passes for wit,
and one beauty rises on the falling reputation of
another. The men, unless the beaus, have nothing
to do with it; and those no farther, than a little
raillery for their diversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd be as free as they had I the power—
For I have chose a person of my own liking, and
my father has contracted me to one that is indifferent
to me. Now, methinks, there's such a pleasure in
the disobedience, that it adds an eloquence to the
suit of a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, d'ye consider that the nature
of this country is revenge—Here is none of the
careless brother, the indulgent father, nor the meek
animal, a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis want of courage in our lovers to put a
good custom in practice, otherwise the jealous fury
of a Spanish Don might in time be moderated to
the content of a London citizen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="139"/>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, you have not so much reason
to complain—Is not Don Philip, your intended husband,
a noble Spaniard, and as agreeable as the
English cavalier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a hideous comparison have you
made! the English cavalier! Is he not all that a
woman can wish for? A man of gallantry—Beautiful
in his person, and agreeable in his conversation?
Are not all the persuasive charms of wit upon his
tongue? Is he not, in short, an Englishman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not Don Philip a man of honour? of a
gallant disposition—And then he loves you as well
as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but then he is to be my husband, Flora;
and the prospect of a fore'd marriage eclipses the
worth of a suitor—Besides, my mother was an
Englishwoman—Therefore I am of so gay a temper,
and so naturally fond of liberty, that I can never be
confin'd to the humours of a jealous Spaniard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd, Madam, by your inclinations
to the English cavalier, that beauty is totally owing
to fancy—But how came you acquainted with him
at first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you—You know when my father sent
for me to Valencia, the people after my arrival
crowded to see me—I was admir'd by the men, and
<PB N="20" REF="140"/>
envy'd by the women—When I appear'd at church,
all were in a consternation—whispering, This is the
governor's daughter—till, contrary to my sex, I was
almost tir'd with vanity itself—One day I went
VEIL'D into the walks to divert myself—There I
thought I saw my father, but afterwards it prov'd
otherwise—Then I flew into a summer-house to
avoid him—where I met this stranger, who, seeing
me in distress, proffer'd his assistance—I was pleas'd
with the compliment, and lik'd both his conversation
and his person—He press'd to know me; but I refus'd
it—However, I have often seen him since, and must
in short, according to appointment, meet him in∣stantly

my reason, as well as my eyes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least—'Tis a ranging un∣settled
passion that's a contradiction to good sense—
But love and reason are inseparable, like wit and
judgment—For as one is fond of the beauty, the
other distinguishes the value of the blessing, and
therefore knows how to prize it.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding your rhetoric, they are an

reason, I shou'd remain in a cloud as I am—and
here break off our correspondence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I deny—For as love has prompted
you thus far, reason will shew you 'tis too late now

we parted last, you promised I should see you—And
I hope you will be as good as your word now.</P>

<P>Have you wanted me on any urgent occa∣sion?

<P>That's very fine indeed! that I must give my

<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my lord; what I come now to request
is in behalf of a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it as it will, Don Philip may command
me in any thing, as far as the rules of honour will
permit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my lord, I shall never be so
ungenerous as to require any thing that wou'd be
a stain to your honour—but my petition to you is in
behalf of Sir Charles Winlove, an English gentle∣man,
who I am inform'd your lordship sent this day
a prisoner to the castle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye know him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, my lord, and know him to
be a man of honour—I ow'd my life to him when
I was in England—and ever after there was such
a friendship between us, that during my continuance
there we were seldom or never asunder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear so honourable a character
of the gentleman—I am sorry for his misfortunes;
but he has injur'd a particular friend of mine in
relation to his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, that proceeds from the wild∣ness
of his youth—we are all subject to such
faults—Sir Charles is what we esteem a fine gen∣tleman;
and the English are all men of gallantry
and intrigue—Besides, if a young lady is inclinable
<PB N="43" REF="163"/>
to be kind, what brisk cavalier can refuse her fa∣vours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I cou'd serve him with honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may: consider, to confine a young
gentleman from his pleasures, is blasting him in the
bloom of his life—Besides, liberty is the very soul
of the English, and they had rather submit to ho∣honourable
death, than bondage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I do in this affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your lordship will allow him to be a
prisoner at large, till you hear farther from Madrid,
my honour shall be the pledge for his security.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd be willing to consent to this, were
I to follow my own inclinations—but his commit∣ment
to the castle is for murder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I know the circumstances of
the story, and the people concern'd in't, except the
young lady—therefore, if you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll believe me, when
I left M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drid, the wounded cavalier was not actually
dead—nay, there was some hopes of his recovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had no such intimation in the letter I re∣ceiv'd
this morning—but now I think on't, my
friend may write so, because I shou'd secure his
daughter—Are you sure of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, my lord, I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then for once I'll yield to your desires—

Follow me, and I'll give you my signet—The keeper

remember I put my honour into your hands, there∣fore
use it with discretion.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, think Sir—we are in a fine place in∣deed
—See what it is to be a great man! The
governor provides you with lodgings here in the
metropolitan castle, where, for the security of your
person, he orders you a retinue of guards, as if
in the king's palace; but methinks these honours,

<P>I don't know what to think—The go∣vernor

no other view in this than the service of his country

prisoner for my own sake, or the lady's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>For both, Sir; but here comes one that will
solve the riddle—A woman in a VEIL—There's

in its full lustre—But now for the letter.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah, I have a key, and a gold one

it bribe a favourite to betray his prince, a senate

to their trust?</P>

<P>One question more, Sir—Have you quite
forgot Fidelia?</P>

charms of your wit so conspire with those of your
beauty, that they must fix ev'n inconstancy itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I esteem such flights but as compliments,
Sir Charles—and a compliment to a lady, like a
poetical flattering panegyric, is the severest satire—for
it shows the persons what they ought to be in
the reverse of what they are.</P>

<P>What arguments can I then use to con∣vince
you of my affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. I shou'd as soon take an atheist for
a man of sense; a wit for a politician; or a politi∣cian
for a man of honour; as a libertine, like Sir
Charles, for a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, can you have so mean
an opinion of your own desert, as to believe a
heart that has been your captive, can ever break
your chains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! but you have been false already, and
inconstancy is as bad a proof of love, as seurrility
is of wit—the one proceeds from a false genius,
and the other from a degenerate passion.</P>

<P>That's a poor evasion, and below a

I shall expect satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e, you are mad—for jealousy
is no other than madness—I tell you there is such
a lady; perhaps, you may be so blinded with love,

the governor and his daughter—but if what I say
is not true, to-morrow you shall have what satis∣faction

jealousy, and now to compleat my misfortune, he
<PB N="62" REF="182"/>

If I stay here and trust the inquisition, 'tis ten times
more unmerciful than a Middlesex jury—A man

<P>Very well! go on, Sir, go on.</P>

<P>No, Madam, by no means—'Tis pro∣bable

an affair with one of your servants only—S'death,
d'ye take me for a fool! is there any other young
lady in the house? Look'e, Madam, I shou'd not
so tamely take this of Sir Charles, but that I scorn
to insult a man in his misfortunes—however, I can
be yet capable of resentment—for know, I'll im∣mediately

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was never so provok'd in my life, as I was
at Don Philip's jealousies, and all this I undergo
for a person that I'm not secure of—For as Fide∣lia
was the first object of Sir Charles's affections,
she'll still be the mistress of his heart—and pos∣session
there, as in the law, will make her eleven
points before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, in my humble opinion,
'twill be better to drop this amour—This lady will,
in the end, discover all—therefore, I think it
better to forsake a victory than to lose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of the same opinion—But what shall
I do in this affair?</P>

<P>Know then, my father has contracted me
to one, who has all the qualities that can make him

<P>Alas, all men are the same, Fidelia!—In

met this Sir Charles at his lodgings, where my
father came, attended with officers, and seiz'd us to∣gether!
—He was carry'd to the castle, and I was
brought home conceal'd in a VEIL; where, by the

<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, I am now convinc'd of
your innocence—My suspicions were the fond er∣rors
of my love, and as such I hope you 'll esteem
'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; when I consider that jealous eyes
always see thro' a microscope, that magnifies the
meanest trisles, to seem as of the greatest conse∣quence
—but had you not been my friend, I
shou'd not so tamely have submitted to such usage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the rashness of my folly to be
great—Let fools have the obstinacy to perfist in
their errors—a generous soul esteems it rather as a
point of honour, when convine'd, to acknowledge
<PB N="86" REF="206"/>
'em.—Therefore, now let us turn the discourse—
I'll assure you, Sir Charles, I think the captive is
very beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful as ever I saw!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still, methinks, my lady excels her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every lover is apt to think his own
mistress the most deserving—Mine has wit as well
as beauty; and where the lusciousness of one may
cloy the appetite, the other whets it again, and
makes all her charms as agreeable as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wit and beauty are two irresistible wea∣pons,
indeed; but, I find, you are in a fair way
to succeed in your hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith—Notwithstanding she has
so many perfections, my success was but very in∣different:
whether the inconstant star that governs
the sex rul'd, I know not; but my reception prov'd
as great a disappointment, as the accident after∣wards
did a surprize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that was a meer feint, only to make
a trial of your love! I find you are not rightly ac∣quainted
with the variety of a lady's humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor ever shall, if 'tis so much ad∣dicted
to whimsey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a lover shou'd make it his business,
first, to study the temper of his mistress, and then
to study every method that may promote her
pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="207"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am not so much a lover as to
submit my reason to frenzy—For to study the tem∣per
of a woman, is like searching out for the phi∣losopher's
stone—a man may spend his estate, run
mad, and grow never the wiser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your harsh censure of
the sex, I wish I knew the humour of my lady, so
far as to gain remission for my solly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, this is ever the consequence of jea∣lousy
—First, you quarrel with your mistress for
no reason, and then are never easy till you're re∣concil'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it is a weakness, indeed; but a
Spaniard is so unfortunate in his passions, that he
can no more avoid the rashness of jealousy, than
he can expel the heat of his climate.—But what
service, Sir Charles, can I do you now in your
amour.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have run thro' as dangerous adven∣tures

to act the part of champion, I was prepar'd with
armour accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you so? Prithee, let's hear the
wonderful description of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, courage was the support of my
back; caution the defence of my breast; wit was
my noble head-piece; and this pistol, the weapon
with which I encounter'd death and destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That pistol, sirrah! What occasion had
you last night to make it give such an alarm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I was assaulted by no less than
a fiery dragon—In short, a great mastiff flew at
my throat, and had I not had the courage to have
encounter'd his fury, I had certainly been torn in
pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, Sir Charles, you must never
be angry with him for his valour—Aspin has now
rival'd the fame of St. George—and I think his
statue ought to be set up in memory of this atchieve∣ment,
as a second honour to your country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="89" REF="209"/>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is past, was but a trial for the courage
of a hero—But the next misfortune I fell into, re∣quir'd
the deepest policy of a statesman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! prithee what was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was this morning discover'd by some of

before my lord governour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! How came you off there, Aspin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, I brought myself off with a wet
finger!—First, the governour ask'd me several
questions—I generously told him the affair you
had last night with the lady—confession merited
mercy, and I was immediately discharg'd like a
man of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you so, sirrah? Know then, ras∣cal,
you have discover'd all my designs, and I'll
this moment make an example of you—</P>

<P>Hold, Sir Charles—consider, his folly

<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Philip, I see your friendship is not like

for you endeavour to serve the person you value,
tho' you see him loaded with affliction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, friendship is only shew'd in
adversity: a man in prosperity has abundance of
professors—but had he need of one, not a friend
amongst 'em all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friendship is mutual—Sir Charles
sav'd your life, and you 'd now return it with the
preservation of his—so that you both are exceptions
from the general rule of the world; for there's
scarce a person in it, besides yourselves, can say,
I have a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the reverse of friendship is the
product of a degenerate age; where honesty passes
for folly; perfidiousness for good policy; and all
manner of knavery, for necessary wisdom to thrive
in the world.—So that a man can no more be
assur'd of friends in adversity, than a king or coun∣try
in distress—when those that shou'd be so, en∣rich
themselves in their destruction.</P>

<P>Now, my lord, if you please, I am

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, I am come to you concerning
an affair of consequence.—You must know, Alon∣zo,
the father of Fidelia, and I, when young,
were never separated from each other—Now, I
understand by a letter from Madrid, you have late∣ly
depriv'd him of his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! depriv'd him of her, my lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but methinks I would willingly heal
this breach—therefore I'd advise you to find some
<PB N="93" REF="213"/>
means, by which you might reconcile yourself to
him, and restore the honour of the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I understand you not—'Tis
true, I love Fidelia as my life; but for her honour,
it is not in the least forfeited on my account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father is of a quite contrary opinion.—
Therefore, if you have either a value for yourself,
or an affection for the young lady, you will consent
to those means, that will contribute to her ease, as
well as to your own security.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I own the wildness of my
youth.—But I have so true an affection for Fidelia,
that for my security, I prize it not in comparison
with her content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Sir Charles, you begin to guess at
my meaning—Therefore I question not but to
find you the man of honour, I was apt at first sight
to believe you—Her same upon your account is
very much become the discourse of the world—
therefore to reconcile all, wou'd you be willing to
accept her for a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I needed not this preparation
to embrace such welcome proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consent to that, and I'll engage your par∣don
shall be secur'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life is of as little value to me now,
as when I ran the risque of forfeiting it for her—
<PB N="94" REF="214"/>
But for the looser wishes that my inconstancy has
been guilty of, cou'd I be so happy to see her, they
wou'd immediately vanish at her sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know then, Sir Charles, the lady is still in
Valencia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! in Valencia, my lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has remain'd in confinement at my
house, ever since I yesterday seiz'd her at your
lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then there is a mistake in this—
The lady that was taken with me, I can assure
you, is not Fidelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father's servant cou'd not be mistaken,
and he afterwards saw her at my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her face too well to be deceiv'd—
The lady that was taken with me, I was a stranger
to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a pretty contrivance indeed!—
In the first place, the young lady owns herself to
be Fidelia, but at the same time denies a corres∣pondence
with you—and now you own a corres∣pondence
with her, but deny she is the person—
Who was it then that you had an assignation with
last night at my house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you have made a discovery in
that affair, 'twa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the lady that was seiz'd
with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="95" REF="215"/>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that lady, you positively say, is not
Fidelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my lord, and if I am in my
senses, I am sure I can affirm it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now she actually says she is—but denies
that she has either seen you, or had any discourse
with you in Valencia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then, there is a farther mystery in
this!—I am certain, the lady I met last night was
not Fidelia.—Now if the person you mean, that
denies all this, shou'd prove to be her, then your
lordship is mistaken, for she can't be the same that
was seiz'd with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there has been no art magic to trans∣form
her, nor to change one person to another.—
Therefore depend on't, she's the same—Now the
messenger from her father went away satisfy'd she
was the right; and she, upon examination, own'd
herself to be so.</P>

<P>I HAVE been told, 'tis a custom to
ask permission for such kind of addresses;
but there is something so very mean in
this civility, to ask your pardon for ne∣glecting
it, were to deserve your in∣dignation.</P>
<P>If merit ought to be preferred to what
the world calls greatness; if a sense of
past favours should be considered, be∣fore
future views; you, Sir, have the
justest title to this Dedication from me,

were the play a performance more worthy

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE importunity of the Publisher being
very pressing, I omit the Preface, which I in∣tended;
wherein I proposed, by way of Essay,
A DISCOURSE ON TRAGEDY: the subject be∣ing
too copious to treat of, in this short time,
I defer it, either to publish it single, or to join
it with some other work.</P>
<P>But my gratitude prompts me to declare
the obligations I have to my best and dearest
friend, Mr. Aaron Hill, for his many judi∣cious
corrections in this Tragedy. On that
worthy gentleman, whose mind is enriched with
every noble science, and in whose breast all
the virtues of humanity are comprised, it will
be my pride, to offer my sentiments in a more
distinguishing manner hereafter.</P>
<P><PB REF="233"/>
I think it my duty also, to return thanks
to the town, for their favourable reception
of this play; and for the applause their indul∣gence
bestow'd on the performance of the
young actors: particularly, for my own suc∣cess,
in a double capacity, as actor and author,
I shall ever publicly confess their generosity,
as it will ever prove my secret satisfaction.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the disadvantage this play
may have received in the representation, I can∣not
omit acknowledging a debt of gratitude to
Mr. Theophilus Cibber, who was very care∣ful
in the management of the rehearsals, and
endeavoured to instruct every one concerned in
the play; a mechanism, which my inexperi∣ence,
as an actor, made me incapable of.</P>
<P>Though an author knows the meaning of his
scenes, he may be unacquainted with a thea∣trical
method of setting them in the most
advantageous appearance. Example enforces
<PB REF="234"/>
precept: and therefore, Mr. Cibber, junior,
took the noblest method to improve others,
by doing justice to his own character; and,
though he labours under the present disadvantage
of small stature, I cannot help concurring with
the opinion of many others, that in action and
elocution, he is certainly a prodigy!</P>

<L>WELL!—'tis a shameful breach, in honour's laws,</L>
<L>To court the credit, and betray the cause!</L>
<L>But, faithful to my sex—Pray ladies! hear me—</L>
<L>And if the poet murmurs, smile, and clear me.</L>
</LG>

<L>He bids me say, Sir Tom was just—brave—witty!</L>
<L>Troth! he was e'en too good for woman's pity—</L>
<L>I find, by histories of the poor soul's life,</L>
<L>He wrote that frightful poem, call'd—THE WIFE.</L>
<L>There, with cold rules, he damps the glow of beauty;</L>
<L>And fetters free-born will, by s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaking duty!</L>
<L>His husbands are mere tyrants—and no wonder!—</L>
<L>They've natural right, he says, to keep us under.</L>
<L>Pleas'd—or not pleas'd—we must, it seems, lie quiet:</L>
<L>And rather starve to death than mend our diet!</L>
<L>Prompt, in obedience, wait the sovereign's motion,</L>
<L>And do, or suffer, with resign'd devotion!</L>

<L>'Tis a fine lesson, truly!—Blast Sir Thomas—</L>
<L>Or—keep the galling yoke of wedlock from us!</L>
<L>Cou'd wives but once such passive grace inherit,</L>

This the fine Overbury! whose just fate</L>
<L>You've seen, to-night, dress'd out in tragic state!</L>
<L>He make a hero!—He attract compassion!</L>
<L>Heaven keep these witty husbands out of fashion!</L>
<L>Had he been mine, I'd paid him for his poem;</L>
<L>And made him feel, what thanks we women owe him!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though lovers please—and mine is a stark new one,</L>

<L>Bless'd be the dose, by which our match miscarry'd;</L>
<L>Heavens!—how I'd hated him, had we been marry'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As to my errand—Ere your smiles I pray,</L>
<L>Thus make him mend the moral of his play:</L>
<L>Trust not repenting Somerset's opinion,</L>
<L>Nor strive to shake our sex's fix'd dominion.</L>
<L>Woman does, ev'n in yielding, conquest gain;</L>
<L>And man, howe'er contending, toils in vain!</L>
<L>Learn, ye lost things! for disobedience hated,</L>
<L>To what sure suff'rings rash mens lives are fated!</L>
<L>Wisely be rul'd:—move on the way we draw ye—</L>
<L>And let due sense of power superior awe ye!</L>
<L>Else, will your ev'ry woe be still kept waking,</L>
<L>And your proud hearts, waste half an age in breaking:</L>
<L>Care shall corrode your thought—Despair invade ye!</L>
<L>Dangers rise round!—and horns want power to shade ye.</L>
