<HEAD><HI>SCENE</HI>—An Apartment at Sir Andrew's—two Doors open. Bell rings—Enter <HI>James</HI> from Door and another Servant. Table and two Chairs.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>RUN—fly—scamper—don't you hear the com∣pany are breaking up. Call Lord Jargon's carriage.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Lady ACID <HI>appears at door, curtesying as if taking leave of somebody.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Good night, my Lord—Delightful man! —I am determined he shall be in possession of Honoria, if it's only in return for his attachment to me. James call up the carriages, and see the company disposed of. I'm so fatigued!—heigh-ho!—seven o'clock again!—I hav'nt been to bed any sooner this fortnight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Andrew, <HI>without.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>—Where are all the servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Here's my fretful husband just got up!—he's so old fashion'd, and so sour; he's never pleased, but when others are vexed; and never unhappy, but when his friends are happy.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Sir ANDREW <HI>in night-gown and cap.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—So my life! just got up I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—So my soul, just going to bed I suppose. What! at the old work—Rout, ball, or concert, heh! making fools happy with my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Psha! you've no idea of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—No; but I have of death. It would kill me in a fortnight; besides every body laughs at you. Not one of your acquaintance, who by the bye have loved and hated each other all round, but on leaving the room exclaims, "Well, it's very fine, mighty grand; but will it last; won't there be a crush by and bye."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Ridiculous, Sir Andrew. An't I visitted by
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>every body? Don't all the beau monde attend Lady Acid's parties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—The beau monde! Why they'll visit any body that is fool enough to invite them; let who will give an expensive entertainment, they'll flock to it, like rooks about a ruin—but this won't do; it's seven o'clock, and I must be eating. Here—you, Sir, bring my break∣fast,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James</SPEAKER>
<P>—Breakfast—what, here, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes, here, sir. I'm sure the beau monde, as your Ladyship calls them, will have no objection to something substantial. Poor Devils! at these sort of parties, they get nothing to feed on but scandal and Faro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Provoking, Sir Andrew, you're always teaz∣ing and vexing me, and I insist on knowing what part of my conduct—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Hold—don't suppose I suspect your charac∣ter; no, 'midst all your gaieties, I still believe you to be so constant and honourable, that there's no indulg∣ing one's self in finding fault with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—If you don't think so, your cousin Colonel Hubbub does, or he never would have trusted me with the care of his niece Honoria. But I leave you to your ill-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Aye; go to bed. You to your pillow, I to my coffee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Mind me, Sir. If you see Honoria, give her the advice I desired you. Tell her the Colonel has written for his Ward Mr. Nominal, to challenge that wretch Clairville, and that I shall do all in my power to give her to Lord Jargon; and so good night, most good humour'd husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—And so good morning, most sweet-temper'd wife.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit Lady A.</HI></STAGE>
<P>I've made her unhappy however—'gad; I don't know how it is, I like to see every body's face as long as my own— <STAGE><HI>[breakfast brought in]</HI></STAGE>—here it comes, and here's the paper <STAGE><HI>[sitting down and taking up newspaper.]</HI></STAGE> Now for it! now for bad news! Theatre Royal—new
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>comedy—Psha, making people grin, and distort their faces. Give me a deep, horrible, agreeable tragedy. Bankrupts—aye, here they are; one, two, three—thir∣teen. Come, very well; that's very well. Promoti∣ons—there they are with their curst joy again. Stocks fallen one and a half—some lame ducks, however.— Marriages, ten—well, long life to you, for you'll be as miserable—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Honoria, <HI>from doors.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Dear Sir, ten thousand pardons, I thought to have found your Ward Miss Strangeway, here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Sit down, Honoria, sit down. I want to talk to you. Come, take some breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Breakfast! I hav'nt been to rest yet. You for∣get the joys of high life, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Joys! she's happy too!—um—silly, ignorant girl, to take pleasure in such unmeaning scenes,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Pleasure! they give me pain, Sir—misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Do they! take some breakfast</P>
<STAGE><HI>[offering her some.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>What have I been doing to-night, Sir! talking to men I detest, and listening to women I despise; mix∣ing with people who have neither feeling, amity, nor sense. This I have done for years, and this I must still persevere in; for my education has taught me to smile when I was miserable, and to be fashionable at the ex∣pence of my peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Sweet creature; how prettily she prattles, Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes, Sir; with a mind naturally attached to domestic happiness, I am compelled to deride all peace∣ful scenes, because my uncle the Colonel, who has cruelly delivered me to the care of your wife, sir—but I interrupt you, I see I do—I'll keep my sorrows to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Don't—don't keep them to yourself. I like to hear you talk about sorrow and misery; and if you know of any more elsewhere, you'll not offend me by imparting it. But now I think on't, tell me that un∣lucky story of the fellow ascending your window by a rope-ladder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Fellow! Sir Andrew—when you are more
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>respectful, I'll talk to you—till when—</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Going.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A—<HI>[Stopping her]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Stay be not offended: I'll sym∣pathize with you, Honoria; I'll give you sigh for sigh, and tear for tear. Come, make me your confidant, and you shan't repent it; nay, you must, you shall. I do love to hear a tale of woe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon—<HI>[Sighing]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh sir! How have I been slandered and defamed. I never knew Mr. Clairville, but as a friend, as a protector. That we had secret meetings I cannot deny: but I was never alone; your Ward Sophia was always present, and she will witness to the world, that he was too honourable to make base proposals, and I too unfashionable to accept them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Go on; I like to hear you, Honoria; if I re∣member, your acquaintance began at the Colonel's villa in the Isle of Wight, when you were sailing and fell from the vessel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes, Sir; and while his brother Lord Jargon and other foplings of the party, who before had offered up their lives to serve me, while they stood idly on the deck, and saw me just expiring. Clairville, then a stran∣ger, leap'd from another vessel, and plunging 'midst the waves, caught me in his arms, and brough me safe to land. Then came the conflict. The Colonel's boat, by adverse winds was blown from shore, and I and my Deliverer remained part of that day alone. I saw, com∣par'd, and lov'd. His heart beat in unison with mine; and now, sir, do you pity or condemn me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—I pity you, pity you sincerely, and curse the Colonel for placing you under the care of my wife, be∣cause I know she designs you for Lord Jargon. But Nominal, whom your uncle intends for your husband, who is hourly expected from France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>—Talk not of that, sir; for I dread the con∣sequences of his arrival. The night Clairville was dis∣covered in my apartment, the Colonel told him, he would send for his Ward Nominal, to avenge the in∣jured honour of his family. Ah, sir! if a duel should ensue—yet if Clairville receives my letter, that and other ills may be prevented <STAGE><HI>[aside]</HI></STAGE> but somebody is coming, sir; allow me to retire.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Do, and depend on my pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection, Honoria; I am always a friend to the unhappy. Good morning.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Honoria exit▪</HI></STAGE>
<P>So there goes another long face.—Here's my Ward the celebrated Miss Alltrade; she is an authoress, an actress, a musician, a painter, and in short, every thing. I know she's in love with me, and I'll have the satisfaction of teazing her soul out.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Miss</HI> STRANGEWAY, <HI>with a Paper in her hand.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia</SPEAKER>
<P>—Positively I will be revenged. The Colonel does nothing but make love to me—heigh-ho!—I'm so fatigued, Gaurdy—and it's vain going to bed, for I've so many places to call at</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—What! all over the town, as usual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes; first I'm going to Lady Bustle's, to finish my picture of her little French lap-dog: then to call at the bookseller's, and correct the press; then to leave this farewel ode to my dear Jugglamintha, at the newspaper office,</P>
<STAGE><HI>[reading.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<Q><L>"Oh! thou whose amaranthine feelings know,</L>
<L>"The iron agonies of copper woe."</L></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Iron agonies of copper woe—that's a fine line, and charmingly distressing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes—then I'm going to rehearse a new Tra∣gedy at the private Theatre, and if you'll believe me, my dying scene is yet unsettled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—That's a great pity, Sophia; for I think the dying scene the best part of the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes; but one insists on my dying on one side of the stage; another on the other—now what am I to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Why what many great politicians have done before you! die between both sides. But, my angel, when am I to be honour'd with an assignation—a-tete-a-tete—heh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Fie, Guardy; you know I told you I lov'd you better than the old Colonel, and—that I'd make fools of you both, before I'd done with you,</P>
<STAGE><HI>[aside.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Whack—<HI>without,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Arrah! stand by now!—I am the valet de chambre de Mr. Nominal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—As I live, Nominal is arrived. This is his Irish servant, who to his brogue has joined a smattering
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>of French—do stay, and hear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—What! mix Irish with French.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—So it seems—but here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> O'WHACK, <HI>followed by</HI> JAMES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Blood and ounds! don't you know me by my Politesse!—Jontleman and Lady, your most obedient. By the red nose of St. Patrick, I am toute nouveau; and d'ye see, I would be after speaking to my master's Guar∣dian Colonel Hubbub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—How is your master? Is he as singular as his Guardian describes him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Singular! What, is he like the Colonel, Sir Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—The image of him. While at College his love of Notoriety first displayed itself, but by living entirely with English abroad, he is become as eccentric and ab∣surd as the Colonel wishes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—By Jasus, you've hit it—ma foi—he is toujours wanting to get into notice, and between our three selves, he keeps me as his Valet, Frisseur, and all that, only becase I perplex, make a noise, and am quite au fait at botheration wherever I go!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—Pray what brings Mr. Nominal so suddenly from France? Is'nt it something about an affair of honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Oui—you may say that. He is come to chal∣lenge one Clairville, for getting into the window of Madamoiselle Honoria; and to be sure he won't give the young seducer a little snug dejeune of cold lead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—'Tis so, then—poor Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Tell us now, had you a pleasant journey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Pleasant!—Oh by the eternal Powers, toute au contraire, my dear: we were stopp'd and robb'd and murder'd—that is, we should have been, but for a fine young haro who came and <HI>rescued</HI> us; Mardleu! he made them skip like frogs!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—A robbery and duel: this journey may produce much pleasing distress. Pray, who was this young hero?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Je ne sais pas lioney—but you may talk of your Caesars, Cleopatras and Paddy Whacks; he beats all your champions of posterity. Oh! had you seen when
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>my master and I were sprawling, how he laid about him with his bit of timber. Depend on't, as our Fille de Chambre said, the Shillaly is the true je ne sais quoi after all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph A</SPEAKER>
<P>—very extraordinary fellow, Sir Andrew—What's your name, friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Bluder O'Whack, Jontleman. The Blunders are the oldest family in Ireland—we were planted there like so many potaty's by a great General, who was af∣tewards Lord Lieutenant to King—what d'ye call the old Monarque;—Oh! King Lear—aye, that's it—King Lear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—King Lear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—C'est vrais Miss; and after that the family got a curst tumble about the reign of Jack Cade—pardonnez mois, though—I forget my business—I must be after informing the Colonel of his Ward's arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Spare yourself the trouble Mr O'Whack, Colonel Hubbub is not here, but I'll take care to inform him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—Je vous remercies, my dear—but d'ye mind me now—depechez vous, and tell him my master's so particular in his person and manners, that you may hear of him any where. Monsieur good luck to you—my Lady, j'ai l'honueur, d'etre tres humble serviteur.—Oh! by my soul, the true comme il faults better than whiskey.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—If the servant is a picture of the master, No∣minal will have too much good humour to quarrel with Clairville. Faith! I almost love him by description. But I must leave you, Guardy—Adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—Nay don't hurry, my angel; it's too soon for the dying scene.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>—I know it, but first I'm going to see a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>—See a friend—then pray let me go with you, for that's a thing I never saw in my life.</P>

<P>—Oui your honour, et la Voila! there he is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—What yonder! well! this is excellent! I knew Nominal always lov'd singularity, but I never thought he'd make himself so particular, that his friends should not know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>—C'ette extraordinaire my dear, but with all his oddities, you can't help loving him—Oh! his heart is as warm as l'eau de vie, and his soul, by St. Patrick! the rest of the world's all blarney to him.</P>

<P>—Ah Saunter my dear follow, well, what do you think? won't it do? shan't I take!—heh!—hark'ye, I have them already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—Have! whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Every body you dog, every body! I've got a name, they stare at me, point at me, laugh at me every where, a'nt I a happy fellow, heh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—If happiness consists in being laughed at, you are, but Nominal—would'nt it be as well, to be known for being rational, as being ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Rational! pshoo! a plain sensible man, is never thought of now, who the devil ever thinks or cares about such a sober, honest fellow as you, who pay every body, and offend nobody, but I now, such a rogue as I who pay nobody, and offend every body, why they all like me, they court me as a new acquaintance, not cut me as an old friend, my boy!</P>
</SP>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, every man in his way, for my part I detest singularity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Then you're an undone man; for by being sin∣gular in nothing, you'll be despis'd in every thing, for instance now George, when you go into company, and inquisitive people say, "who is he? what Mr. Saunter," nobody can describe you, you have been guilty of no absurdities, no improprieties! but when I condescend to enter a room, there's a general buz of applause, and the women all whisper, "that's he! the famous Ned Nominal! who games, who drinks, who sights, who intrigues! Oh! the sprightly vicious fellow!" In short, George, I'm a public character!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—A public character! what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Why then I make a damn'd noise without any meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe Nominal you are deceiv'd, a character so <HI>useless,</HI> can neither excite admiration or attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Useless! oh George! George! how little dost thou know of modern life! useless! that's the very thing that makes me! now let me put a plain and sim∣ple question to you, is'nt a cat that walks on four legs an useful animal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—A cat on four legs useful! 'tis an odd question—certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Very well! and what do you think of a cat with only two legs! why it's useless; and yet you and the rest of the world, shall give it twice the admiration and attention! and there's the difference between us George, you are a very useful worthy fellow, and con∣sequently are despis'd, I am a very useless mischievous fellow, and of course am admir'd, therefore my dear boy, take my advice; expose yourself, and get into notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—Why you are the counterpart of your Guar∣dian the Colonel, and when he finds you thus bitten with the love of Notoriety, he'll be delighted, transport∣ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—Yes: but I mean to disappoint him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—Disappoint him!</P>
</SP>
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; and for three reasons, George; First, because he wants me to marry Honoria, a girl I don't care for; secondly, because he has brought me to fight one Clairville, a poor Devil I never saw; and thirdly, because being in Opposition, makes more noise than being under Government—you understand me—I mean to quarrel with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—And how will you contrive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—His greatest antipathy is to law and lawyers. I'll pass on him as a student.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun</SPEAKER>
<P>—Student! Why you don't understand the practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nom</SPEAKER>
<P>—No; who the Devil does: but a little goes a a great way, George—so never fear.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
