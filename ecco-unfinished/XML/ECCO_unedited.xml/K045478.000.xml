<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>THUS far in safety—all's hush—our subtle air of France quickens not the temperament of the enemy—these phlegmatic English snore out the night in as gross, as when their senses stagnate in their own native fogs, where stupor lies like lead upon them, which the mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y rogues call sleep; we have nearly pass'd the entrench∣ments—La Gloire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where did you direct our mariners to meet us with the boat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, I told them to meet us with the boat at the sea-shore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vague booby—at what point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the point I was coming to—and if a certain jutting out of land, in the shape of a white clift, with brown furze on its top, like a bushy head of hair over a pale face, stands where it did—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>East of the town, I have mark'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To see now the difference of men—what I have hunted after a whole day to fix upon, hath he noted without labour—oh the capacious heads of our great officers—no wonder they are so careful of them in battle, and thrust forward the pitiful pates of the privates, to be mowed off, like a parcel of daisies—but there lies the spot, and there will the mariners come—we are now within ear-shot, and when they are there, they will whistle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>And till they give the signal, here, if there is ought of safety to be pick'd from danger, is the least dangerous spot to tarry for them—we are here full early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would we were not here at all, this same scheme of victualling a town, blockaded by the enemy, is a service for which I have little appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think, La Gloire, of the distress of the in∣habitants, our countrymen perishing with hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, sir, it moves the bowels of my compassion; yet consider the risque, consider your rank the gallant Count Ribemont, flower of Chi∣valry, cream of the French army, turned cook to the corporation of Calais, carving his way to glory, through stubble rump'd capons, unskinn'd mutton, raw veal, and vegetables; and perhaps, my Lord, before we are able to serve up the meat to the town, in comes a raw-bon'd Englishman, and runs his spit through your body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee no more objections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I object! not I—but I have serv'd your honor, in, and out of the army, babe, boy, and man, these five and twenty years, come the next feast of the Virgin, and heaven forefend, I should be out of service, by being out of my master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I know thy zeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your English rapier is a mar∣vellous sudden dissolver of attachments—'twill sever the closest connections—'twill even whip you for ever, friend head, from his intimate ac∣quaintances, neck and shoulders, before they have time to take leave, not that I object—yet men do not always sleep; the fat centinel, as we pass'd the out-post, might have woke with his own snoring—and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace! remember your duty to me,—to your country—and yet alas, I mock myself to name it—did not those rugged battlements of Calais, that tomb, yet safeguard of its citizens, which shuts the sword out, and locks hunger in, (where many a wretch, pale, gaunt, and famine-struck, smiles ghastly at the slaughterous threat and dies) clasping sweet beauty's queen—encircled now within their cold and ponderous embrace, the fair yet ah! I fear the fickle Julia, thy sluggish zeal, would slack the power to rouse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And of all the spurs in the race of mor∣tality, love is the only true tickler to quicken a man's motions; but to reconcile a mistress by victualling a town! well, dark and puzzling is the road to woman's affections—but this is the first time I ever heard of sliding into her heart, through the palate, or choaking her anger, by stopping her mouth with a meal—an' this pantry fashion of wooing should last, woe to the ill fa∣vour'd.
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
—Beauty will raise the price of provisions, and poor ugliness will soon be starved out of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>This enterprize may yet regain her—once she was kind, until her father's policy, nou∣rish'd in courts, stept in, and check'd her love: yet 'twas not love, for <HI>true</HI> love knows no check—there is no skill in Cupid's archery, when duty heals a love wound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly, nor is she likely, while he provides her with entertainment; true love's groans are best nourish'd by fasting; but dear my Lord, think on the great danger, and little repu∣tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more; mark me, La Gloire; as your officer, I may command you onward, but in re∣spect to your early attachment, your faithful service ere you follow'd me to the army, if your mind misgives you in this undertaking, you have my leave to retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say you are free to return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, my Lord, I am son to brave old Eustace De St. Pierre, as tough a citizen as any in all Calais—I was carried into your Lord∣ship's Father's family, (your Lordship being but then just born) at six days old, a mere whelp, as a body may say, according to puppy reckoning; my Lord, I was with you three days before I could see; I have followed you through life, frisk∣ing and trotting after your Lordship ever since, and if you think me now mongrel enough to turn tail, and leave my master in a scrape, why 'twere kinder e'en to hang me up at the next tree, than cut me through the heart with your suspicions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, La Gloire!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord, 'tis fear for you makes me bold to speak—to see you running your head thro' stone walls for a woman, and a woman, who, tho' she be an angel, has, (saving your presence) play'd you but a scurvy sort of a jade's trick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death, villain, how dare your sland'rous tongue to—but 'tis plain—'tis for thy own wretched sake thou art anxious—drivelling cow∣ard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coward! coward! Diable! a French Soldier, who had the honor to carry arms under his most Christian majesty, Philip the sixth, king of France, call'd coward! Sacre Bleu! have I al∣ready serv'd in three campaigns, and been thump'd and bobb'd about by the English, to be call'd coward at last: oh that any but my commander had said it—coward!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, La Gloire, I may have been hasty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my lord, it—it's no matter; but haply you'd like to be convinced of the courage of your company, and if such a thing as raising the enemy's camp, can clear a man's character, I can do it as soon as—coward!</P>

<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death fool, we shall be discover'd.</P>

Isn't the honor the greater, the greater the danger, and has any body had the honor of being in greater danger than <HI>you</HI> are—rejoice then, for your peril is extreme; be merry, for you have a glorious dismal prospect before you, and as plea∣sing a state of desperation as the heart of a sol∣dier could wish.

<P>You! Why Eustace De St. Pierre, you are one of the sourest old crabs of all the citizens of Calais; and if reviling your neighbours be a sign of ill-will to one's country, and ill-will to one's country, a sign of good-will to strangers, a man might go near to think you a friend to the English.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know them, they are our enemy, a biting, but a blunt strait forward foe; and when we weave our subtle webs of state, and spin fine stra∣tagems to entangle them, they come to our doors, and pull the work to pieces, dispute it fist to fist, and score their arguments upon our politic pates; remember Cressy—we've reason to remember it—they thump'd us, and soundly there—'tis but some few months back—there, in the bowels of our land, at Cressy, they so bechopp'd us with their English logic, that our French heads ached sorely for it—from thence marching thro' Picardy

<P>Poor fool! thy words are shrewder than thy meaning; how many crowd the narrow sphere of lise, with those gay, gaudy flowers of society, those annuals, call'd acquaintance, which do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade, and die away ere we can say, they blossom—mocking the idle cultivator's care, from year to year, while one poor slip of friendship, hardy, tho' modest, stands the winter's frost, and cheers its owner's eye with ever green.</P>

<P>Troth, my Lady, one honest potatoe in a garden, is worth a hundred beds of your good-for-nothing tulips. Oh, it's meat and drink to me to see a friend; and truly it's lucky in this time of famine, to have one in the house to look at, just to keep me from starving; little did I think,

eight years ago when I came over among fifty thousand brave boys, English, Irish, and Welch, to fight under King Edward, who now lies before Calais here, that I should find such a warm soul towards me, in a Frenchman's body, as I have in your noble old father's; especially when the busi∣ness that brought me was to give his countrymen a beating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy gratitude, O'Carroll, has well re∣paid the pains my father took in preserving thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gratitude! faith Madam, begging your pardon, 'tis no such thing—it's nothing but shewing the sense I have of my obligation; there was I, in the year 1339, in the English Camp, in the fields of Viranfosse, near Capelle, which never came to an action, excepting a trifling bit of a skirmish, in which my good friends left me for dead, out of our lines, when a kind enemy, your father, (blessing on his friendly heart for it) pick'd me up; and set the breath a going again, that was almost thump'd out of my body. He sav'd my life; it is but a poor commodity; but as long as it lasts, he shall have the wear and tear of it.</P>

<P>Thou hast been a trusty follower, O'Carroll; nay more a friend than follower; thou art entwined in all the interests of our house, and art attached to me, as to my father, thy master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, by my troth, Lady Julia, and a great deal more, more shame to me for it, because I am indebted for <HI>all</HI> to the Governor. I don't know how it may be with wiser nations, but if regard is to go to a whole family, there's some∣thing about the female part of it, that an Irishman can't help giving the preference to, for the soul of him.</P>

<P>To be sure, I am well assur'd, for I in∣form'd myself, and I never yet catched myself cut in telling a lie; there were six of them, as tall fellows as any in France, with ugly ropes about their good looking necks, going to the town gates, and Count Ribemont march'd second in

<P>Now Heaven make firm my woman's heart.—'Tis you are yourself abus'd. My countrymen do trifle with you King.—You did require six of our citizens first in repute, and best considered in our town, as victims of your high thron'd anger.—There—<STAGE>(pointing to Ribe∣mont)</STAGE> is one, I single out, and challenge to the proof. Let him stand forth—and here I do avouch—he is no member of our city.—He does usurp another's right, defeats your mighty pur∣pose, and your rage which thirsted for a rich draught of vengeance, must now be serv'd with the mere dregs of the community.</P>

<P>A man; let that content you, Sir; 'tis blood you crave, and with an appetite so keen, 'tis strange to find you nice about its quality. But for this slave, who has thus dared belie me, did not circumstance run in my will—Oh grant me patience, Heaven! the dregs! now by my soul I'd crush thee, reptile, beneath my feet, now while thy pois'nous tongue is darting forth its ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m'd slander on me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be satisfied in this. Speak, fellow, what is thy condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, 'tis waste of Royal breath to make this stir for me, who some few minutes hence, your sentence must sink to nothing. Henceforward I am dumb to all interrogation.</P>

<P>Now, by our Diadem!—but answer you what is his state; say of whose wretched place is he the bold usurper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, of mine. He does despoil me of my title, comes back bedecked in my just due, which as a citizen (a young man though I be) I here lay claim to. I am your victim, Sir; dismiss this man, (who haply comes in pity to my youth, and plucks the glory from me, which this cere∣mony would grace my name withal) and let me die.</P>

<P>The glory! Why by heaven these head strong French toy with our punishments—for thee, rash stripling, who dost brave our ven∣geance, prepare to meet it. Yoke thee with this knave whose insolence has roused my spleen, and straight ye both shall suffer for't together.</P>

<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir! 'ere I do meet my fate, upon my knee I do make one poor request.—This man, great Sir, though now there's reason why he knows me not, I own doth touch me nearly; I do owe him a debt of gratitude—'twould shock me sore to see him in his agony,—so please you—command that in the order of our deaths I may precede him.</P>

<P>Well, be it so then—Guards lead them forth.</P>

<P>Conduct them to their fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, 'ere we go—your spleen here breaks the end of prudence; the blood you now would spill is pure and noble, nor will the shed∣ding of it, lack avengers.—Shame on disguise, off with't, my Lord, behold our France's foremost champion, and remember in many a hardy fight the gallant deeds of Count Ribemont. Oft has he put you to't—nay late at Cressy; ask of your Black Prince Edward there, how long Count Ribemont and he were point to point; he has attacked our foe, relieved our people, succoured our town, 'till cruel disappointment, where he had fixed his gallant heart, did turn him wild, with despairing love. Old John De Vienne re∣fused his daughter to him, drove him hither to meet your cruelty—and now that daughter, grown desperate as he, doth brave it, and we will die together.</P>

<P>Heavens! my Julia! art thou then true? Oh! give me utterance! now Fortune do thy worst—you cannot King, you dare not for your life lay savage hands on female innocence; and for myself, e'en use your will.</P>

<P>Lady, you are free; our British Knights are famed for courtesy; and it will ne'er I trust be said, an Englishman denied protection to a woman.—You must under guard, my Lord, abide our pleasure—for the remainder, they have heard our will; and they must suffer, 'tis but fit we prove, spite of their obstinate and close de∣fence, our English excellence.</P>
<STAGE>(During this Speech, the Queen comes down.)</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then, my Liege, prove it in mercy, valour, and compassion; do characterize the Englishman.—His adamantine heart hath waxen fibres; which though in perilous hazard, cool and firm, is rock against attack, shew him, the fall'n, 'twill warm, and melt for the unfor∣tunate. Let it not dwell within your thoughts, my Liege, thus to oppress these men: and Royal Sir, since you were free to promise, in remem∣brance of the poor service which my weak en∣deavours wrought in your absence, for your realm, to grant whatever boon I begged—now, on my knee, I beg it, Sir; release these wretched men; make me the means of cheering the un∣happy; and though my claim were tenfold what it is, upon your bounty, 'twould reward me no∣bly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, Madam; though 'twas our fixed intent to awe these French by terrible example, our promise still is sacred, good Philippa; thy fuit is won, and we relax our rigour; let them pass free, while we here pronounce a general pardon.</P>
