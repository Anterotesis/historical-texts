<LG>
<L><HI>MAdam,</HI> The Glories of your Happy Reign</L>

<L>You're <HI>doubly blest</HI> with strange exalted Joy,</L>
<L>At home with Peace, <HI>Abroad with Victory.</HI></L>
<L>If this is but the Earnest of your Fame,</L>
<L>To what strange heights will Heav'n exalt your Name!</L>
<L>And what Seraphick Thoughts must fill your Mind,</L>
<L><HI>When you reflect</HI> on Glories still behind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your mighty Predecessor strove in vain</L>
<L>This <HI>very happy Moment</HI> to obtain:</L>
<L>Through Fields of Blood and slaughter'd Armies fought,</L>
<L>But always miss'd the happy Prize he sought.</L>
<L>His dreadful Sword in numerous Battles Try'd,</L>
<L>And push'd at Vict'ry hard, <HI>but Heav'n deny'd.</HI></L>
<L>In vain he might the distant Nymph pursue;</L>
<L><HI>The Case is plain,</HI> sh' has been reserv'd for you.</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Lewis</HI> may then with Infamy come down,</L>
<L>With all the Borrow'd Glories of his Crown,</L>
<L>And offer up his Trophies at your Throne.</L>
<L>The haughty Monarch may with Grief disdain</L>
<L>That Female Pow'r that he'd resist in vain.</L>
<L>And he that <HI>William</HI>'s Terrors cou'd withstand,</L>
<L>Wou'd grieve to fall by those <HI>that you Command:</HI></L>
<L>'Tis twice to Die, to Die by Woman's Hand.</L>
</LG>

<L><HI>Madam,</HI> The Hopes of this exalts your Height;</L>
<L>This makes your Subjects smile, <HI>your Souldiers fight.</HI></L>
<L>Who knows the Force of your Victorious Charms,</L>
<L>Circl'd with <HI>English Hearts</HI> and <HI>English Arms?</HI></L>
<L>A Monarch plac'd like you in such a Seat,</L>

<L>Such Subjects, <HI>Madam,</HI> by such Influence led,</L>
<L>Where shall they not your dreadful Banners spread!</L>

<LG>
<L>See how the Nations your Assistance own,</L>
<L>And bend their Lawrels underneath your Throne!</L>
<L>Your Conquering <HI>English</HI> Legions spread your Fame,</L>
<L>And <HI>when they kill your Foes, repeat your Name.</HI></L>
<L>Your happy Genius to their Valour joyn'd,</L>
<L>Seems Heav'n and Earth to Victory design'd.</L>
<L>Never was <HI>such an English Army</HI> seen,</L>

<L>To you that send us out <HI>and him that Leads!</HI></L>

<L>The suppliant Princes stand about your Gate,</L>

<L>New Wonders crowd the Nation's glutted Ears</L>

<L>With Joy <HI>she</HI> sought new Refuge in your Throne,</L>

<L>HAil, VICTORY! <HI>Thou Stranger to our Land;</HI></L>
<L>Thou coy long-courted Mistress of Mankind,</L>
<L>Debauch'd by Tyrants, ravish'd by the Strong,</L>

<L>Thy Chariot has with wonted Fraud</L>
<L>Allur'd our Champions to Attempts abroad:</L>
<L>We thought we had thy Meaning understood;</L>
<L>And courted thee thro' Seas of <HI>English</HI> Blood:</L>
<L>But when we thought thy Friendship sure,</L>
<L>More tempting Objects does thy fickle Mind allure:</L>

<LG>
<L>Invading Numbers are thy Bait,</L>
<L>Too oft on potent Treason thou canst wait,</L>

<L>How often have we seen thee try'd?</L>

<L>How often have thy Banners been display'd</L>
<L>O'er abject Truth, and Right betray'd?</L>
<L>How have oppressing Legions rais'd their Fame</L>

<L>Thou formidable strong Pretence,</L>

<L>Thou can'st supply the want of Wit,</L>
<L>In thee the widest Contradictions hit.</L>

<L>What ravag'd Towns in Flames appear,</L>

<L>Call themselves Great, Immortal, and Divine,</L>
<L>When all their wild Idolatry is thine!</L>
<L>Had Victory to Virtue been but true,</L>
<L><HI>Lewis,</HI> thy Triumphs had been few:</L>

<L><HI>Trick, Sham, Contrivance,</HI> and <HI>Surprize,</HI></L>

<L>Why thou thy Fav'rite <HI>England</HI> do'st forsake?</L>
<L>Where thou had'st always just Applause,</L>
<L>Could always Heroes find, or Heroes make.</L>
<L>In Civil Broils the Goddess took the Side</L>
<L>Where truest Valour could her Chariot guide,</L>
<L>Quite unconcern'd as to the Cause of War;</L>
<L>'Twas Fighting only that contented her.</L>
<L>When Battail join'd, and furious Squadrons met,</L>
<L>She hover'd o'er the bloody Spot</L>
<L>Without examining the Cause;</L>
<L>Bestow'd her Lawrels by her Martial Laws.</L>
<L>But when she came to see</L>
<L>How ill they us'd their dear-bought Victory;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
Asham'd of those she had caress'd before,</L>
<L>She fled for forty Years, and came no more.</L>
<L>To <HI>Germany</HI> from hence she fled,</L>
<L>With Pleasure there she us'd to tread;</L>
<L>At <HI>Leipsick, Lutzen, Nordlingen,</HI> and <HI>Prague,</HI></L>
<L>She triumph'd o'er the <HI>Austrian</HI> League:</L>
<L>There she the Tomb of great <HI>Gustavus</HI> saw,</L>
<L>Who chain'd her to his Saddle-bow,</L>
<L>Who made his Valour be her Law,</L>
<L>And her Amazement too.</L>
<L>So swift his Conquest, so secure his Hand,</L>
<L>Not Victory her self could him withstand.</L>
<L>Had she the Lawrels for his Foes design'd,</L>
<L>Had she been partially inclin'd;</L>
<L>So closely and so boldly he pursu'd,</L>
<L>Ev'n Victory her self was there Subdu'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>The angry Goddess, loth to be confin'd,</L>
<L>Strove to bestow a Lawrel from his Head;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
But his impetuous Valour scorn'd the Deed,</L>
<L>And ravish'd Victory against her Mind.</L>
<L>The haughty Nymph with his new Fame opprest,</L>
<L>The mighty Conqu'ring King addrest:</L>
<L><HI>Here's Victory and Death,</HI> said she;</L>
<L>If you will Conquer you must die.</L>
<L><HI>I will,</HI> th' undaunted Prince reply'd;</L>
<L>So Conquer'd Victory, and dy'd.</L>

<L>To <HI>France</HI> the Goddess went from hence;</L>
<L>They Deify'd her there, and call'd her Providence:</L>
<L>Pleas'd to be thus Caress'd, she pitch'd her Tent;</L>
<L>And with their Armies always went.</L>
<L>Young <HI>Nassau</HI> courted her in vain,</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch</HI> would not defray the Charges of her Train,</L>
<L>She lik'd the Youth, his Valour pleas'd her much,</L>
<L>But something out of Humour with the <HI>Dutch:</HI></L>
<L>Yet she agreed their sinking State to save,</L>
<L>Join'd the young Prince at <HI>Naerden</HI> and the <HI>Grave;</HI></L>

Bravely she led him on,</L>

<L>But, baulk'd by <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>She left him, and return'd to <HI>France</HI> again:</L>
<L>Then stay'd so long upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI></L>
<L>'Twas thought she had been married to <HI>Turenne:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Conde</HI> enjoy'd her once or twice,</L>
<L>But left her to possess his meaner Vice.</L>
<L>And <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> employ'd her so,</L>

<L><HI>Schomberg</HI> her fickle Favour won,</L>

<L>At last <HI>Britannia</HI> call'd her o're,</L>

<L>Traytors and Cowards startled at her Name:</L>
<L>And when they heard 'twas <HI>William</HI> brought her o're,</L>

<L>Conquest out-rid his Troops, and Fear</L>

<L>She plac'd her Image up in ev'ry Street,</L>
<L>She led our Armies, <HI>nay</HI> she led our Fleet:</L>

<L>She stay'd behind to propagate his Fame,</L>
<L>And Conquer'd <HI>Ireland</HI> in his Name.</L>

<L>Tell us, returning Nymph, the Causes why</L>
<L>Thy Blessing did from <HI>England</HI> fly?</L>

<L>And fetch'd her home, but could not make her stay.</L>
<L>And seeing he in vain pursu'd,</L>

<L>Now tell us, Nymph, <HI>and yet forbear,</HI></L>
<L>The Causes of thy Flight,</L>
<L>Of which so many blush to hear,</L>
<L>So few will dare to write.</L>
<L>Was it that Traytors dwelt at home,</L>
<L>And Cowards went to War,</L>
<L>Some sold the Fleet, the Army some,</L>
<L>And some were Rogues for fear.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="20"/>
Some stay'd at home our Councils to betray,</L>
<L>Some bravely went abroad to run away.</L>
<L>The few that had some Courage brought,</L>
<L>First damn'd the Cause, and for the Money fought</L>
<L>The awkward Heroes made the War a Trade,</L>
<L>And Fought as Dully as they had been Paid:</L>
<L>And Thousands, <HI>which was worst of all,</HI></L>

These made him weary of the War,</L>

<LG>
<L>These are the Men that held the Nation's Hands,</L>
<L>That thwarted his more just Commands;</L>

<L>The fatal'st way of being Betray'd.</L>
<L>Had his Successor been abus'd like him,</L>
<L>Not Heav'n it self cou'd Victory obtain.</L>
<L>He never form'd a proper Scheme,</L>

<L>If he Commission'd them to fight,</L>
<L>They kept the Enemy out of sight;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Old English Courage</HI> scorns those trifling things,</L>
<L>The <HI>Higher Ground,</HI> the <HI>Well-flank'd Wings:</HI></L>
<L>He that will Conquer whatsoe'er it cost,</L>

<L>This Wing <HI>the Woods</HI> may flank, <HI>the Castle</HI> that;</L>
<L>They leave it to their Swords and Fate:</L>

<L>The Leading Hero's Worth on either side.</L>

Never were Armies in the Field before,</L>

<L>The Flow'r of <HI>Europe</HI> on this Stage appear,</L>

Pleas'd with the just Advantages he saw,</L>
