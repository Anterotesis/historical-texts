A
POEM.</HEAD>
<L>AS on the sea-beat shore <HI>Britannia</HI> sat,</L>
<L>Of her degenerate sons the faded fame,</L>
<L>Deep in her anxious heart, revolving sad:</L>
<L>Bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale,</L>
<L>That hoarse, and hollow, from the bleak surge blew;</L>
<L>Loose flow'd her tresses; rent her azure robe:<MILESTONE N="6"/></L>
<L>Hung o'er the deep, from her majestic brow</L>
<L>She tore the laurel, and she tore the bay.</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd the copious grief to bathe her check;</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd her sobs to murmur to the main.<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Peace discontented nigh, departing, stretch'd</L>
<L>Her dove-like wings: and War, tho' greatly rouz'd,</L>
<L>Yet mourn'd his fetter'd hands. While thus the queen</L>
<L>Of nations spoke; and what she said the Muse</L>
<L>Recorded, faithful, in unbidden verse.<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Even not yon sail, that, from the sky-mix'd wave,</L>
<L>Dawns on the sight, and wafts the ROYAL YOUTH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frederic prince of Wales, then lately arrived.</NOTE></L>
<L>A freight of future glory to my shore;</L>
<L>Even not the flattering view of golden days,</L>
<L>And rising periods yet of bright renown,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>

<L>This tame beseeching of rejected peace?</L>

it to the recommendation and influence of the subject. In you the
cause and concerns of liberty have so zealous a Patron, as entitles
whatever may have the least tendency to promote them, to the dis∣tinction
of your favour. And who can entertain this delightful re∣flection,
without feeling a pleasure far superior to that of the fondest
author; and of which all true lovers of their country must partici∣pate?
To behold the noblest dispositions of the Prince, and of the
Patriot, united: an overflowing benevolence, generosity, and can∣dour
of heart, joined to an enlightened zeal for liberty, an intimate
persuasion that on it depends the happiness and glory both of King
and People: to see these shining out in public virtues, as they have
hitherto smiled in all the social lights and private accomplishments of
life, is a prospect that cannot but inspire a general sentiment of sa∣tisfaction
and gladness, more easy to be felt than expressed.</P>
<P>If the following attempt to trace Liberty, from the first ages,
down to her excellent establishment in GREAT BRITAIN, can at
all merit your approbation, and prove an entertainment to YOUR

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<L>THUS spoke the GODDESS of the fearless eye,</L>
<L>And at her voice, renew'd, the vision rose.</L>
<L>First, in the dawn of time, with eastern swains,</L>
<L>In woods, and tents, and cottages, I liv'd;</L>
<L>While on from plain to plain they led their flocks,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>In search of clearer spring, and fresher field.</L>
<L>These, as increasing families disclos'd</L>
<L>The tender state, I taught an equal sway.</L>
<L>Few were offences, properties, and laws.</L>
<L>Beneath the rural portal, palm-o'erspread<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>The father-senate met. There justice dealt,</L>
<L>With Reason then and Equity the same,</L>
<L>Free as the common air, her prompt decree;</L>
<L>Nor yet had stain'd her sword with subject's blood.</L>
<L>The simpler arts were all their simpler wants<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Had urg'd to light. But instant, these supply'd,</L>
<L>Another set of fonder wants arose,</L>
<L>And other arts with them of finer aim;</L>
<L>Till from refining want to want impell'd</L>
<L>The mind by thinking push'd her latent powers,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>And life began to glow, and arts to shine.</L>
<L>At first, on brutes alone the rustic war</L>
<L>Launch'd the rude spear; swift, as he glar'd along,</L>
<L>On the grim lion, or the robber-wolf.</L>
<L><PB N="264" REF="35"/>
For then young sportive life was void of toil,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Demanding little, and with little pleas'd:</L>
<L>But when to manhood grown, and endless joys,</L>
<L>Led on by equal toils, the bosom fir'd;</L>
<L>Lewd lazy rapine broke primaeval peace,</L>
<L>And, hid in caves and idle forests drear,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>From the lone pilgrim and the wand'ring swain,</L>
<L>Seiz'd what he durst not earn. Then brother's blood</L>

<L>Awful in justice then the burning youth,</L>
<L>Led by their temper'd sires, on lawless men,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>The last worst monsters of the shaggy wood,</L>
<L>Turn'd the keen arrow, and the sharpen'd spear.</L>
<L>Then war grew glorious. Heroes then arose;</L>
<L>Who scorning coward self, for others liv'd,</L>
<L>'Toil'd for their ease, and for their safety bled.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>West with the living day to GREECE I came:</L>
<L>Earth smil'd beneath my beam: the Muse before</L>
<L>Sonorous flew, that low till then in woods</L>
<L>Had tun'd the reed, and sigh'd the shepherd's pain;</L>
<L>But now to sing heroic deeds, she swell'd<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>

<L>For GREECE my sons of EGYPT I forsook;</L>
<L>A boastful race, that in the vain abyss</L>

<L>To mingle with his stars; and every Muse,</L>
<L>Astonish'd into silence, shun the weight</L>
<L>Of honours due to his illustrious name?</L>
<L>But what can man—Ev'n now the sons of light<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>In strains high-warbled to seraphic lyre,</L>
<L>Hail his arrival on the coast of bliss.</L>
<L>Yet am not I deterr'd, though high the theme,</L>
<L>And sung to harps of angels; for with you,</L>
<L>Aethereal flames! ambitious, I aspire<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>In Nature's general symphony to join.</L>
<L>And what new wonders can you show your guest!</L>
<L>Who, while on this dim spot, where mortals toil</L>
<L>Clouded in dust, from Motion's simple laws,</L>
<L>Could trace the secret hand of Providence,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Wide-working thro' this universal frame,</L>
<L>Have ye not listened, while he bound the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</L>
<L><PB N="444" REF="212"/>
And planets to their spheres! th' unequal task</L>
<L>Of human kind till then. Oft had they roll'd</L>
<L>O'er erring man the year, and oft disgrac'd<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>The pride of schools, before their course was known</L>
<L>Full in its causes and effects, to him,</L>
<L>All-piercing sage! who sat not down and dream'd</L>
<L>Romantic schemes, defended by the din</L>
<L>Of specious words, and tyranny of names;<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>But, bidding his amazing mind attend,</L>
<L>And with heroic patience years on years</L>
<L>Deep-searching, saw at last the System dawn,</L>
<L>And shine, of all his race, on him alone.<MILESTONE N="29"/></L>
<L>What were his raptures then! how pure! how strong!</L>
<L>And what the triumphs of old <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>By his diminish'd, but the pride of boys</L>
<L>In some small fray victorious! when instead</L>
<L>Of shatter'd parcels of this earth usurp'd</L>
<L>By violence unmanly, and sore deeds<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Of cruelty and blood, Nature herself</L>
<L>Stood all subdu'd by him, and open laid</L>
<L>Her every latent glory to his view.</L>
<L>All intellectual eye, our solar round</L>
<L>First gazing thro', he by the blended power<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Of <HI>gravitation</HI> and <HI>projection</HI> saw</L>
<L>The whole in silent harmony revolve.</L>
<L>From unassisted vision hid, the moons</L>
<L>To chear remoter planets numerous form'd,</L>
<L>By him in all their mingled tracts were seen.<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>He also fix'd our wandering queen of night:</L>
<L>Whether she wanes into a scanty orb,</L>
<L>Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadewy light,</L>
<L>In a soft deluge overflows the sky.</L>
<L>Her every motion, clear discerning, He<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Adjusted to the mutual Main, and taught</L>
<L><PB N="445" REF="213"/>
Why now the mighty mass of water swells</L>
<L>Resistless, heaving on the broken rocks,</L>
<L>And the full river turning; till again</L>
<L>The tide revertive, unattracted, leaves<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>A yellow waste of idle sands behind.</L>
<L>Then breaking hence, he took his ardent flight</L>
<L>Thro' the blue infinite; and every star,</L>
<L>Which the clear concave of a winter's night</L>
<L>Pours on the eye, or astronomic tube,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Far-stretching, snatches from the dark abyss,</L>
<L>Or such as farther in successive skies</L>
<L>To fancy shine alone, at his approach</L>
<L>Blaz'd into suns, the living centre each</L>
<L>Of an harmonious system: all combin'd,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul'd unerring by that single power,</L>
<L>Which draws the stone projected to the ground.</L>
<L>O unprofuse magnificence divine!</L>
<L>O wisdom truly perfect! thus to call</L>
<L>From a few causes such a scheme of things,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Effects so various, beautiful, and great,</L>
<L>An universe compleat! and, O belov'd</L>
<L>Of Heaven! whose well-purg'd penetrative eye,</L>
<L>The mystic veil transpiercing, inly scann'd</L>
<L>The rising, moving, wide-establish'd frame.<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>He, first of men, with awful wing pursu'd</L>
<L>The Comet thro' the long elliptic curve,</L>
<L>As round innumerous worlds he wound his way;</L>
<L>Till, to the forehead of our evening sky</L>
<L>Return'd, the blazing wonder glares a new,<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay.</L>
<L>The heavens are all his own; from the wild rule</L>
<L>Of whirling <HI>vortices</HI> and circling <HI>spheres,</HI></L>
<L>To their first great simplicity restor'd.</L>
<L>The Schools astonish'd stood; but found it vain<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L><PB N="446" REF="214"/>
To combat still with demonstration clear</L>
<L>And, unawaken'd, dream beneath the blaze</L>
<L>Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled,</L>
<L>With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd,</L>
<L>When NEWTON rose, our philosophic sun.<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>Th' aërial flow of Sound was known to him,</L>
<L>From whence it first in wavy circles breaks,</L>
<L>Till the touch'd organ takes the message in.</L>
<L>Nor could the darting Beam, of speed immense,</L>
<L>Escape his swift pursuit, and measuring eye.<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>Even Light itself, which every thing displays,</L>
<L>Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind</L>
<L>Untwisted all the shining robe of day;</L>
<L>And, from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze,</L>
<L>Collecting every ray into his kind,<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train</L>
<L>Of parent-colours. First, the flaming Red</L>
<L>Sprung vivid forth; the tawny Orange next;</L>
<L>And next delicious Yellow; by whose side</L>
<L>Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing Green.<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Then the pure Blue, that swells autumnal skies,</L>
<L>Aethereal play'd; and then, of sadder hue,</L>
<L>Emerg'd the deepen'd Indico, as when</L>
<L>The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost.</L>
<L>While the last gleamings of refracted light<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>Dy'd in the fainting Violet away.</L>
<L>These, when the clouds distil the rosy shower,</L>
<L>Shine out distinct a down the wat'ry bow;</L>
<L>While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends</L>
<L>Delightful, melting on the fields beneath.<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Myriads of mingling dyes from these result,</L>
<L>And myriads still remain—Infinite source</L>
<L>Of beauty, ever-flushing, ever-new!</L>
<L>Did ever Poet image aught so fair,</L>
<L><PB N="447" REF="215"/>
Dreaming in whispering groves, by the hoarse brook!</L>
<L>Or prophet, to whose rapture heaven descends!<MILESTONE N="121"/></L>
<L>Even now the setting sun and shifting clouds,</L>
<L>Seen, <HI>Greenwich,</HI> from thy lovely heights, declare</L>
<L>How just, how beauteous the <HI>refractive law.</HI></L>
<L>The noiseless tide of time, all bearing down<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>To vast eternity's unbounded sea</L>
<L>Where the green islands of the happy shine.</L>
<L>He stemm'd alone; and to the source (involv'd</L>
<L>Deep in primaeval gloom) ascending, rais'd</L>
<L>His lights at equal distances, to guide.<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>Historian, wilder'd on his darksome way.</L>
<L>But who can number up his labours? who</L>
<L>His high discoveries sing; when but a sew</L>
<L>Of the deep-studying race can stretch their minds</L>
<L>To what he knew: in fancy's lighter thought.<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>How shall the Muse then grasp the mighty theme?</L>
<L>What wonder thence that his devotion swell'd</L>
<L>Responsive to his knowledge! for could he,</L>
<L>Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw</L>
<L>The finish'd university of things,<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>In all its order, magnitude, and parts,</L>
<L>Forbear incessant to adore that Power</L>
<L>Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole?</L>
<L>Say, ye who best can tell, ye happy few,</L>
<L>Who saw him in the softest lights of life,<MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>All un-with-held, indulging to his friends</L>
<L>The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind,</L>
<L>Oh speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calm,</L>
<L>How greatly humble, how divinely good;</L>
<L>How firm establish'd on eternal truth;<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Fervent in doing well, with every nerve</L>
<L>Still pressing on, forgetful of the past,</L>
<L>And panting for perfection: far above</L>
<L><PB N="448" REF="216"/>
Those little cares, and visionary joys,</L>
<L>That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Of ever-cheated, ever-trusting man.</L>
<L>And you, ye hopeless gloomy-minded tribe,</L>
<L>You who, unconscious of those nobler flights</L>
<L>That reach impatient at immortal life,</L>
<L>Against the prime endearing privilege<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Of Being dare contend, say, can a soul</L>
<L>Of such extensive, deep, tremendous powers,</L>
<L>Enlarging still, be but a finer breath</L>
<L>Of spirits dancing thro' their tubes a while,</L>
<L>And then for ever lost in vacant air?<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>But hark! methinks I hear a warning voice,</L>
<L>Solemn as when some awful change is come,</L>
<L>Sound thro' the world—“<HI>Tis done!—The measure's full;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I resign my charge.”</HI>—Ye mouldering stones,</L>
<L>That build the towering pyramid, the proud<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>Triumphal arch, the monument effac'd</L>
<L>By ruthless ruin, and whate'er supports</L>
<L>The worship'd name of hoar antiquity,</L>
<L>Down to the dust! what grandeur can ye boast,</L>
<L>While Newton lifts his column to the skies,<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>Beyond the waste of time. Let no weak drop</L>
<L>Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom</L>
<L>Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child,</L>
<L>These are the tombs that claim the tender tear</L>
<L>And elegiac song. But NEWTON calls<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>For other notes of gratulation high,</L>
<L>That now he wanders thro' these endless worlds</L>
<L>He here so well descried, and wondering talks,</L>
<L>And hymns their Author with his glad compeers.</L>
<L>O <HI>Britain's</HI> boast! whether with angels thou<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow-blest,</L>
<L>Who joy to see the honour of their kind;</L>
<L><PB N="449" REF="217"/>
Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing,</L>
<L>Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs,</L>
<L>Comparing things with things, in rapture lost,<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>And grateful adoration, for that light</L>
<L>So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below,</L>
<L>From LIGHT <HI>himself;</HI> Oh look with pity down</L>
<L>On human kind, a frail erroneous race!</L>
<L>Exalt the spirit of a downward world!<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>O'er thy dejected country, chief preside,</L>
<L>And be her <HI>Genius</HI> call'd! her studies raise,</L>
<L>Correct her manners, and inspire her youth:</L>
<L>For, tho' deprav'd and sunk, she brought thee forth,</L>
<L>And glories in thy name; she points thee out<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star:</L>
<L>While in expectance of the second life,</L>
<L>When time shall be no more, thy sacred dust</L>
<L>Sleeps with her kings, and dignifies the scene.</L>
