<HEAD>TO THE QUEEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Majesty has so often declar'd Your just Con∣cern for the Nations Loss, and Your Value for the Memory of the late King: You have so publickly approv'd his Conduct, so visibly mov'd in the same Steps, and pursu'd the wise Measures of this <HI>Your Glorious Ancestor,</HI> that it cannot be thought displeasing to Your Majesty, to reprehend those who make a Mock at the Sorrow of Your Majesty and Three Nations.</P>
<P>Your Majesty was the first who told us <HI>he cou'd not be suffi∣ciently lamented.</HI> May those who are not of the same Mind find no Favour with Your Majesty, nor their Maker, till they repent that Sin against his Merit, and the Voice of their Na∣tive Country.</P>
<P>Here are no Reflections upon Your Majesties <HI>Houshold,</HI> or <HI>Council,</HI> or <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> or <HI>either House of Parliament,</HI> and consequently no Offence against Your Royal Proclamation. 'Twou'd be an Affront to Your Majesty to imagine there were any under all those Heads of Your Government cou'd deserve the Reproof of the following <HI>Satyr.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
Your Majesty has an entire Possession of the Hearts of Your People, but their Affection is still the deeper rooted by that generous Sorrow you have express'd for the Loss of him to whom they owe the full Possession of their Liberty under Your Government.</P>
<P>How they can be faithful Subjects to Your Majesty that were not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue Friends to such a King, is a Mystery out of humane Ʋnderstanding, since the Happiness we enjoy by Your Govern∣ment proceeds from his defending us against those <HI>who wou'd not have had Your Majesty to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>'Twou'd be a Crime against Your Majesty, which deserv'd no Pardon to suggest you shou'd be offended at that part of the <HI>Satyr</HI> which points at our Immoralities: Your Majesties Example, as well as Command, has encourag'd us all to <HI>de∣clare War</HI> against Vice, and there we are sure of Your Royal Protection.</P>
<P>For the rest, if an extraordinary Concern for the Glorious Memory of the late King has led the Author into any Excesses, he begs Your Majesty wou'd place it to the Account of that <HI>just Passion</HI> every honest Man retains for his extraordinary Merit; believing that no Man can have an Indifferency for the Me∣mory of <HI>King William,</HI> and at the same time have any Desire for the Welfare of his Native Country.</P>
<P>While Your Majesty pursues the true Interest of <HI>England,</HI> the Protestant Religion, and the Welfare of <HI>Europe,</HI> as he did, you will have the same Enemies that he had, the same to oppose You abroad, and reproach You at home; but You will thereby engage all Your honest Subjects to adhere the firmer to their Duty, all Your Protestant Neighbours to depend upon Your Protection, and God shall Crown Your Majesty and these Nations with His Special Favour and Benediction.</P>

<HEAD>A SATYR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SUCH has been this Ill-Natur'd Nations Fate,</L>
<L>Always to see their Friends and Foes too late;</L>
<L>By Native Pride, and want of Temper led.</L>
<L>Never to value Merit till 'tis Dead:</L>
<L>And then Immortal Monuments they raise,</L>
<L>And Damn their Former Follies by their Praise,</L>
<L>With just Reproaches Rail at their own Vice,</L>
<L>And Mourn for those they did before despise:</L>
<L>So they who <HI>Moses</HI> Government defied,</L>
<L>Sincerely sorrow'd for him when he Died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<L>And so when <HI>Brittain</HI>'s Genius fainting lay,</L>
<L>Summon'd by Death, which Monarchs must obey:</L>
<L>Trembling, and Soul-less half the Nation stood,</L>
<L>Upbraided by their own Ingratitude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They, who with true born Honesty before,</L>
<L>Grudg'd him the Trophies he so justly wore,</L>
<L>Were, with his Fate, more than himself dismay'd,</L>
<L>Not for their King, but for themselves afraid.</L>
<L>He had their Rights and Liberties restor'd,</L>
<L>In Battle purchas'd, and by Peace secur'd:</L>
<L>And they with <HI>English</HI> Gratitude began,</L>
<L>To feel the Favour and despise the Man.</L>
<L>But when they saw that his Protection ceas'd,</L>
<L>And Death had their Deliverer possest;</L>
<L>How Thunder struck they stood! What cries they rais'd!</L>
<L>They lock't like Men Distracted and Amaz'd:</L>
<L>Their Te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcr did their Conscious Guilt explain,</L>
<L>And wish't their injur'd Prince Alive again.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
They Dream't of Halters, Gibbets and of Jails,</L>
<L>French Armies, Popery and Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI></L>
<L>Descents, Invasions, Uproars in the State,</L>
<L>Mobs, Irish Massacres, and God knows what:</L>
<L>Imaginary Enemies appear'd,</L>
<L>And all they knew they Merited, they Fear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis strange that Pride and Envy should prevail,</L>
<L>To make Men's Sence as well as Vertue fail:</L>
<L>That where they must depend they should abuse,</L>
<L>And slight the Man they were afraid to loose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>William</HI> had not Govern'd Fourteen Year,</L>
<L>To be an unconcern'd Spectator here:</L>
<L>His Works like Providence were all Compleat,</L>
<L>Which made a Harmony we Wonder'd at.</L>
<L>The Legislative Power he set Free,</L>
<L>And led them step by step to Liberty,</L>
<L>'Twas not his Fault if they cou'd not Agree.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Impartial Justice He Protected so,</L>
<L>The Laws did in their Native Channels flow,</L>
<L>From whence our sure Establishment begun,</L>
<L>And <HI>William</HI> laid the first Foundation Stone:</L>
<L>On which the stately Fabrick soon appear'd,</L>
<L>How cou'd they sink when such a Pilot steer'd?</L>
<L>He taught them due defences to prepare,</L>
<L>And make their future Peace their present care:</L>
<L>By him directed, Wisely they Decreed,</L>
<L>What Lines shou'd be expell'd, and what succeed;</L>
<L>That now he's Dead, there's nothing to be done,</L>
<L>But to take up the Scepter he laid down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Circle of this Order is so round,</L>
<L>So Regular as nothing can confound:</L>
<L>In Truth and Justice all the Lines commence,</L>
<L>And Reason is the vast circumference:</L>
<L><HI>William</HI>'s the moving Centre of the whole,</L>
<L>'T had else a Body been without a Soul</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Fenc't with just Laws, impregnable it stands,</L>
<L>And will for ever last in <HI>Honest Hands,</HI></L>
<L>For Truth and Justice are the Immortal Springs,</L>
<L>Give Life to Constitutions and to Kings:</L>
<L>In either case, if one of these decay,</L>
<L>These can no more Command than those obey:</L>
<L>Right is the only Fountain of Command,</L>
<L>The Rock on which Authority must stand.</L>
<L>And if executive Power steps awry,</L>
<L>On either hand it splits on Tyranny:</L>
<L>Oppression is a plague on Mankind sent,</L>
<L>To infect the Vitals of a Government.</L>
<L>Convulsions follow, and such Vapours rise,</L>
<L>The Constitution Suffocates and Dies:</L>
<L>Law is the Grand specific to restore,</L>
<L>And unobstructed, never fails to Cure,</L>
<L>All other Remedies compar'd to that,</L>
<L>Are Tampering and Quacking with the State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<L>The Constitution's like a vast Machine,</L>
<L>That's sull of curious Workmanship within:</L>
<L>Where tho' the parts unwieldly may appear,</L>
<L>It may be put in Motion with a Hair.</L>
<L>The Wheels are Officers and Magistrates,</L>
<L>By which the whole contrivance operates:</L>
<L>Laws are the Weights and Springs which make it move,</L>
<L>Wound up by Kings as Managers above;</L>
<L>And if they'r screw'd too high or down too low,</L>
<L>The movement goes too fast or else too slow.</L>
<L>The Legislators are the Engineers,</L>
<L>Who when 'tis out of Order make Repairs:</L>
<L>The People are the Owners, 'twas for them,</L>
<L>The first Inventor drew the Ancient Scheme.</L>
<L>'Tis for their Benefit it works, and they</L>
<L>The Charges of maintaining it defray:</L>
<L>And if their Governours unfaithful prove,</L>
<L>They, Engineers or Mannagers remove,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Unkind Contention sometimes there appears,</L>
<L>Between the Managers and Engineers,</L>
<L>Such strife is always to the Owners wrong,</L>
<L>And once it made the work stand still too long.</L>
<L>Till <HI>William</HI> came and loos'd the Fatal Chain,</L>
<L>And set the Engineers to work again:</L>
<L>And having made the wondrous thing compleat,</L>
<L>To <HI>Anne</HI>'s une<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring hand he left the Helm of State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Anne</HI> like <HI>Elisha</HI> when just <HI>William</HI> went,</L>
<L>Receiv'd the Mantle of his Government:</L>
<L>And by Divine Concession does inherit,</L>
<L>A Double Portion of his Ruling Spirit.</L>
<L>The Dying Hero loaded with Renown,</L>
<L>Gave her the Nations Blessing with the Crown,</L>
<L>From God, the People, and the Laws her own.</L>
<L>Told her that he had Orders from on High,</L>
<L>To lay aside the Government and Dye:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
What he had Fought for, gave her up in Peace,</L>
<L>And chear'd her Royal Heart with Prospect of Success.</L>
<L>While he, who Death in all its Shapes had seen,</L>
<L>With full Composure quiet and serene,</L>
<L>Passive and undisorder'd at his Fate,</L>
<L>Quitted the English Throne without Regret.</L>
<L>No Conscious Guilt disturb'd his Royal Breast,</L>
<L>Calm as the Regions of Eternal Rest:</L>
<L>Before his Life went out, his Heaven came in,</L>
<L>For all was bright without and clear within.</L>
<L>The blest Rewards did to his sight appear,</L>
<L>The Passage easie, and the prospect near:</L>
<L>His parting Eye the gladsom Regions spied,</L>
<L>Just so, before his Dear <HI>Maria</HI> Dyed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His High concern for <HI>England</HI> he express't,</L>
<L><HI>England,</HI> the Darling of his Royal Breast:</L>
<L>The Transports of his parting Soul he spent,</L>
<L>Her dis united Parties to Lament,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
His Wishes then supplied his want of Power,</L>
<L>And Pray'd for them, for whom he Fought before</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Speak Envy, if you can, inform us what</L>
<L>Cou'd this unthankful Nation Murmur at?</L>
<L>But Discontent was always our Disease,</L>
<L>For <HI>English-men</HI> what Government can please.</L>
<L>We always had our Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> here,</L>
<L>Who knew no God nor Government to Fear:</L>
<L>No Wonder these dislik'd his Gentle sway,</L>
<L>Unwilling Homage to his Scepter Pay,</L>
<L>And only did for want of Power, Obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some soft excuse for them we might contrive,</L>
<L>Had he not been the Gentlest Prince Alive:</L>
<L>Had he not born with an exalted Mind,</L>
<L>All that was disobliging and unkind.</L>
<L>Peaceful and Tender Thoughts his Mind possess't,</L>
<L>And High Superior Love conceal'd the rest:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
Our Discontents wou'd oft his Pity move,</L>
<L>But all his Anger was supprest by Love.</L>
<L>That Heaven-born Passion had subdu'd his Soul,</L>
<L>Possess't the greatest part, and Rul'd the whole:</L>
<L>This made him strive his People to possess,</L>
<L>Which he had done, had he oblig'd 'em less.</L>
<L>He knew that Titles are but empty things,</L>
<L>And Hearts of Subjects are the strength of Kings:</L>
<L>Justice and Kindness were his constant care,</L>
<L>He scorn'd to Govern Mankind by their Fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Universal Love he strove to Gain,</L>
<L>'Twas hard that we should make him strive in vain:</L>
<L>That he should here our English Humours find,</L>
<L>And we, that he had sav'd, shou'd be unkind.</L>
<L>By all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndearing stratagems he strove,</L>
<L>To draw us by the secret springs of Love:</L>
<L>And when he could not Cure our Discontent,</L>
<L>It alw ys was below him to Resent.</L>

<L>Nature was never seen in such excess,</L>
<L>All Fury when Abroad, at Home all Peace:</L>
<L>In War all Fire and Blood, in Peace enclin'd,</L>
<L>To all that's Sweet, and Gentle, Soft and Kind,</L>
<L>Ingratitude for this, must needs Commence,</L>

<LG>
<L>When King's to Luxury and Ease Resign'd,</L>
<L>Their Native Countries just defence declin'd;</L>
<L>This High pretending Nation us'd to plead,</L>
<L>What they'd perform had they a King to lead.</L>

Wisely declin'd the hazards of the War,</L>

<L>Wrapt in Luxurious plenty they Debauch,</L>

<L>Backward in Deeds, but of their Censures free,</L>
<L>And slight the Actions which they dare not see.</L>
<L>At Home they bravely teach him to Command,</L>

<L>And Curse the strangers, tho' they Fight for them▪</L>
<L>Tho' some who wou'd excuse the matter say,</L>

<L><HI>Namure</HI>'s Gygantick Towers he o'erthrew;</L>

<L><HI>Joshua</HI> might still ha' staid on <HI>Jordan</HI>'s Shore,</L>

<L><PB N="21" REF="24"/>
Almighty Power was forc'd to interpose,</L>
<L>And frighted both the Water and his Foes:</L>
<L>But had my <HI>William</HI> been to pass that Stream,</L>
<L>God needed not to part the Waves for him.</L>
<L>Not Forty Thousand <HI>Canaanites</HI> cou'd stand,</L>
<L>In spight of Waves or <HI>Canaanites</HI> he'd land:</L>
<L>Such Streams ne'er stemm'd his Tide of Victory;</L>
<L>No, not the Stream; no, nor the Enemy.</L>

<LG>
<L>The greatest Captains of the Ages past,</L>
<L>Debauch'd their Fame with Cruelty at last:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="25"/>
<HI>William</HI> did only Tyrants subdue;</L>
<L>These conquer'd Kings, and then the People too:</L>
<L>The Subjects reap'd no Profit for their Pains,</L>
<L>And only chang'd their Masters, not their Chains;</L>
<L>Their Victories did for themselves appear,</L>
<L>And made their Peace as dreadful as the War:</L>
<L>But <HI>William</HI> fought Oppression to destroy,</L>
<L>That Mankind might in Peace the World enjoy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>The</HI> Pompeys, Caesars, Scipio<HI>'s,</HI> Alexanders,</L>
<L>Who croud the World with Fame, were great Com∣manders:</L>
<L>These too brought Blood and Ruin with their Arms,</L>
<L>But <HI>William</HI> always fought on other Terms:</L>
<L>Terror indeed might in his Front appear,</L>
<L>But Peace and Plenty follow'd in his Rear:</L>
<L>And if Oppression forc'd him to contend,</L>
<L>Calmness was all his Temper, Peace his End:</L>
<L>He was the only Man we e'er saw fit</L>
<L>To regulate the World, or conquer it.</L>

Who can his Skill in Government Gainsay,</L>
<L>He that can <HI>England</HI>'s brittle Scepter sway,</L>
<L>Where Parties too much rule, and King's obey?</L>
<L>He always reign'd by Gentleness and Love,</L>
<L>An Emblem of the Government above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vote me not Childless then in Christendom,</L>
<L>I▪yet have Sons in my suspended Womb;</L>
<L>And 'till just Fate such due Provision makes,</L>
<L>A Daughter my Protection undertakes.</L>
<L>Crowns know no Sexes, and my Government</L>

<L>Queens have to me been always fortunate,</L>
<L>E'er since my <HI>English Phoenix</HI> rul'd the State;</L>
<L>Who made my People rich, my Country great.</L>
<L>Satyr be just, and when we lash their Crimes,</L>
<L>Mingle some Tears for <HI>William</HI> with our Rhimes.</L>
<L>Tho' Baseness and Ingratitude appear,</L>
<L>Thank Heaven that we ha' weeping Millions here:</L>
<L>Then speak our hearty Sorrows if you can,</L>
<L>Superior Grief in feeling Words explain:</L>

Accents that wound, and all the Senses numb,</L>
<L>And while they speak may strike the Hearer dumb:</L>
<L>Such Grief as never was for King before,</L>
<L>And such as never, never shall be more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See how Authority comes weeping on,</L>
<L>And view the Queen lamenting on his Throne.</L>
<L>With just Regret she takes the Sword of State,</L>
<L>Not by her Choice directed, but his Fate;</L>
<L>Accepts the sad Necessity with Tears,</L>
<L>And mournfully for Government prepares.</L>
<L>The Peoples Acclamations she receives</L>
<L>With sadn'd Joy, and a Content that grieves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>View next the sad Assemblies that appear,</L>
<L>To tell their Grief for Him, and Joy for Her.</L>
<L>The first confounds the last with such Excess,</L>
<L>They hardly can their noble Thoughts express.</L>
<L>The illustriou; Troop address her to condole,</L>

<L>They lodge their Sorrows in the Royal Breast;</L>
<L>The Harbour where the Nation looks for Rest.</L>

<L>Next these, the Representatives arise,</L>
<L>With all the Nations Sorrow in their Eyes.</L>
<L>The Epithets they righteously apply</L>
<L>To the Restorer of their Liberty,</L>
<L>Are Tokens of their Sence and Honesty.</L>
<L>For as a Body we were always true,</L>
<L>But 'tis our Parties that our Peace undo.</L>
<L>Who can like them the Peoples Grief express?</L>
<L>They shew her all the Tokens of Excess:</L>
<L>O'erwhelm'd with Sorrow, and supprest with Care,</L>
<L>They place the Nation's Refuge now in her:</L>
<L>Nothing but her Succesfion cou'd abate</L>
<L>The Nation's Sorrow for their Monarch's Fate:</L>
<L>And nothing but his Fate cou'd their true Joy</L>
<L>For her Succession lessen or destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Civil Sword to her, as Heaven saw fit,</L>
<L>With general Satisfaction they commit:</L>
<L>How can it in a Hand like hers miscarry?</L>
<L>But who shall for us weild the Military?</L>

Who shall the jarring Generals unite;</L>

<L>Who shall the growing Gallick Force subdue?</L>
<L>Twas more than all the World, but him, cou'd do.</L>

<LG>
<L>Sighs for departed Friends are sensless things,</L>
<L>But ▪tis not so when Nations mourn for Kings:</L>
<L>VVhen wounded Kingdoms such a Loss complain,</L>
<L>As Nature never can repair again;</L>
<L>The Tyrant Grief, like Love, obeys no Laws,</L>
<L>But blindly views the Effect and not the Cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dark are the VVorks of Sovereign Providence,</L>
<L>And often clash with our contracted Sence:</L>
<L>But it we might with Heavens Decrees debate,</L>

<L>VVhy shou'd he form a Mind supreamly great,</L>

<L>A Blow so sudden, so severe and swift,</L>
<L>VVe had no time for Supplication left:</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="30"/>
As if Almighty Power had been afraid,</L>
<L>Such Prayers wou'd by such Multitudes be made;</L>
<L>Such <HI>Moses</HI>'s wou'd to his Altars go,</L>
<L>To whom he never did, or wou'd say no;</L>
<L>He hardly cou'd know how to strike the Blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Prayer so much the Soveraign Power commands,</L>
<L>Ev'n God himself sometimes as conquer'd stands,</L>

<LG>
<L>How Strenuous then had been the Sacred Strife,</L>

<L>Sprinkle his Memory with grateful Tears,</L>

<L>VVith what Contempt will <HI>English</HI> Men appear,</L>

<L><PB N="28" REF="31"/>
They'll never bear to hear in time to come,</L>

<L>The VVorld will scarce believe it cou'd be true,</L>
<L>And Vengeance must such Insolence pursue.</L>
<L>Our Nation will by all Men be abhorr'd,</L>

What thankless Devil had the Land possest;</L>

<L>The Records of their Fathers they'll Deface,</L>
