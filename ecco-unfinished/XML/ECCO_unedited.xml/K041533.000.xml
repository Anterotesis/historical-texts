<L>A Friend and Father lost; permit the <HI>Muse,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Muse</HI> assign'd of old a double Theme,</L>
<L>To praise dead Worth and humble living Pride,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Whose generous Task begins where Int'rest ends,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Permit her on a TALBOT's Tomb to lay</L>
<L>This cordial Verse sincere, by Truth inspir'd,</L>
<L>Which means not to bestow but borrow Fame.</L>
<L>Yes, she may sing his matchless Virtues now—</L>
<L>Unhappy! that she <HI>may.</HI>—But where begin?<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>How from the Diamond single out each Ray,</L>
<L>That, tho' they tremble with ten thousand Hues,</L>
<L>Effuse one poignant undivided Light?</L>
<L>Let the Low-minded of these narrow Days</L>
<L>No more presume to deem the lofty Tale<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Of antient Times, in Pity to their Own,</L>
<L>Romance. In TALBOT we united saw</L>
<L>The piercing Eye, the quick enlighten'd Soul,</L>
<L>The graceful Ease, the flowing Tongue of <HI>Greece,</HI></L>
<L>Join'd to the Virtues and the Force of <HI>Rome.</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
ETERNAL WISDOM, that All-quick'ning Sun,</L>
<L>Whence every Life, in just Proportion, draws</L>
<L>Directing Light and actuating Flame,</L>
<L>Ne'er with a larger Portion of it's Beams</L>
<L>Awaken'd mortal Clay. Hence steady, calm,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Diffusive, deep and clear, his Reason saw,</L>
<L>With instantaneous View, the Truth of Things;</L>
<L>Chief what to Human Life and Human Bliss</L>
<L>Pertains, that kindest Science, fit for Man:</L>
<L>And hence, responsive to his Knowledge, glow'd<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>His ardent Virtue. Ignorance and Vice,</L>
<L>In Consort foul, agree; Each heightning Each;</L>
<L>While Virtue draws from Knowledge nobler Fire,</L>
<L>Is Knowledge of true Pleasure, prov'd by Deeds.</L>
<L>What grand, what comely, and what tender Sense,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>What Talent, and what Virtue was not His?</L>
<L>All that can render Man or great, or good,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Give useful Worth, or amiable Grace?</L>
<L>Nor could he brook in studious Shade to lie,</L>
<L>In soft Retirement, indolently pleas'd<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>With selfish Peace. The SYREN of the Wise,</L>
<L>(Who steals th' <HI>Aonian</HI> Song, and, in the shape</L>
<L>Of Virtue, wooes them from a worthless World)</L>
<L>Tho' deep he felt her Charms, could never melt</L>
<L>His strenuous Spirit, recollected, calm,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>As silent Night, yet active as the Day.</L>
<L>The more the Bold, the Bustling, and the Bad,</L>
<L>Usurp the Reins of Power, the more behoves,</L>
<L>Becomes it Virtue, with indignant Zeal,</L>
<L>To check their Conjuration. Shall low Views<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Of sneaking Int'rest or luxurious Vice,</L>
<L>The Villain's Passions, quicken more to Toil,</L>
<L>And dart a livelier Vigour thro' the Soul,</L>
<L>Than Those that, mingled with our truest Good,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
With present Honour and immortal Fame,<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Involve the Good of All? An empty Form,</L>
<L>Vain is the Virtue, that amid the Shade</L>
<L>Lamenting lies, with future Schemes amus'd,</L>
<L>While <HI>Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Folly, kindred Powers,</HI></L>
<L>Confound the World. A TALBOT's, different far,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Sprung into Action: Action, that disdain'd</L>
<L>To lose, in living Death, one Pulse of Life,</L>
<L>That might be sav'd; disdain'd, for Coward Ease,</L>
<L>And her insipid Pleasures, to resign</L>
<L>The Prize of Glory, the keen Sweets of Toil,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>And those high Joys that teach the truly Great</L>
<L>To live for Others, and for Others die.</L>
<L>Early behold! he breaks benign on Life.</L>
<L>Not breathing more Beneficence, the Spring</L>
<L>Leads, in her swelling Train, the gentle Airs;<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>

Of ruffian Storms and Winter's lawless Rage.</L>
<L>In Him <HI>Astrea,</HI> to this dim Abode</L>
<L>Of ever-wandering Men, return'd again:</L>
<L>To bless them his Delight, to bring them back,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>From thorny Error, from unjoyous Wrong,</L>
<L>Into the Paths of kind primeval Faith,</L>
<L>Of Happiness and Justice. All his Parts,</L>
<L>His Virtues all, collected, sought the Good</L>
<L>Of Human-kind. For That he, fervent, felt<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>The Throb of Patriots, when they model States:</L>
<L>Anxious for That, nor needful Sleep could hold</L>
<L>His still-awaken'd Soul; nor Friends had Charms</L>
<L>To steal, with pleasing Guile, an healing Hour;</L>
<L>Toil knew no Languor, no Attraction Joy.<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>The common Father Such of erring Men!</L>
<L>A froward Race! incessant in Purfuit</L>
<L>Of flying Good, or of fallacious Bliss:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Still as they thwart and mingle in the Chace,</L>
<L>Now Fraud, now Force, now Cruelty and Crimes,<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>Attempting All to seize a Brother's Prize;</L>
<L>HE sits superior to the little Fray,</L>
<L>Detects the Legal Snares of mazy Guile,</L>
<L>With the proud Mighty bids the Feeble cope,</L>
<L>And into social Life the Villain daunts.<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>Be nam'd, victorious Ravagers, no more!</L>
<L>Vanish, ye Human Comets! shrink your Blaze!</L>
<L>Ye that your Glory to your Terrors owe,</L>

<L>Effulgent Sweetness! beaming Life and Joy.</L>
<L>How the Heart listen'd while he, pleading, spoke!</L>
<L>While on th' enlighten'd Mind, with winning Art,</L>
<L>His gentle Reason so persuasive stole,<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
That the charm'd Hearer thought it was his own.</L>
<L>Ah! when, ye studious of the Laws, again</L>
<L>Shall such enchanting Lessons bless your Ear?</L>
<L>When shall again the darkest Truths, perplext,</L>
<L>Be set in ample Day? Again the Harsh<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>And Arduous open into smiling Ease?</L>
<L>The Solid mix with elegant Delight?</L>
<L>To Him the purest Eloquence indulg'd</L>
<L>Eternal Treasure, Light and Heat combin'd,</L>
<L>At once to pour Conviction on the Soul,<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>And mould, with lawful Flame, th' impassion'd Heart.</L>
<L>That dangerous Gift, which to the strictly Just,</L>
<L>And Good, alone, belongs, lay safe with Him</L>
<L>Repos'd. He sacred to his Country's Cause,</L>
<L>To trampled Want and Worth, to suffering Right,<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>To the lone Widow's and her Orphan's Woes,</L>
<L>Reserv'd the mighty Charm. With equal Brow,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Despising then the Smiles or Frowns of Power,</L>
<L>He all that noblest Eloquence effus'd,</L>
<L>Which wakes the tender or exalting Tear,<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>When generous Passions, taught by Reason, speak.</L>
<L>Then spoke the Man; and, over barren Art,</L>
<L>Prevail'd abundant Nature. Freedom Then</L>
<L>His Client was, Humanity and Truth.</L>
<L>Plac'd on the Seat of Justice, There he reign'd,<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>In a superior Sphere of cloudless Day,</L>
<L>A pure Intelligence. No Tumult There,</L>
<L>No dark Emotion, no intemp'rate Heat,</L>
<L>No Passion e'er disturb'd the clear Serene</L>
<L>That round Him spread. A Zeal for Right, alone,<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>The Love of Justice, like the steady Sun,</L>
<L>Unbating Ardor lent; and now and then,</L>
<L>Against the Sons of Violence, of Pride,</L>
<L>And bold Deceit, his Indignation gleam'd.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
As Intuition quick, he snatch'd the Truth,<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>Yet with progressive Patience, Step by Step,</L>
<L>Self-diffident, or to the Slower kind,</L>
<L>He thro' the Maze of Falsehood urg'd it on,</L>
<L>Till, at the last evolv'd, it full appear'd,</L>
<L>And even the Loser own'd the just Decree.<MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>But when, in Senates, He, to FREEDOM firm,</L>
<L>Enlighten'd FREEDOM, plann'd salubrious Laws,</L>
<L>His various Learning, his wide Knowledge, Then,</L>
<L>His Insight deep into BRITANNIA's Weal,</L>
<L>Spontaneous seem'd from simple Sense to flow,<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>And the plain Patriot smooth'd the Brow of Law.</L>
<L>No specious Swell, no frothy Pomp of Words,</L>
<L>Fell on the cheated Ear; no study'd Maze</L>
<L>Of Declamation, to perplex the Right,</L>
<L>He darkening threw around: safe in itself,<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>In it's own Force, almighty Reason spoke;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
While on the great the ruling Point, at once,</L>
<L>He stream'd decisive Day, and show'd it vain</L>
<L>To lengthen farther out the clear Debate.</L>
<L>Conviction breathes Conviction; to the Heart,<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Pour'd ardent forth in Eloquence <HI>unbid,</HI></L>
<L>The Heart attends: for let the <HI>Venal</HI> try</L>
<L>Their every hard'ning stupifying Art,</L>
<L>Truth must prevail, Zeal will enkindle Zeal,</L>
<L>And Nature, skilful touch'd, is honest still.<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>Behold Him in the Councils of his Prince.</L>
<L>What faithful Light he lends? How rare, in Courts,</L>
<L>Such Wisdom! such Abilities! and join'd</L>
<L>To Virtue so determin'd, Public Zeal,</L>
<L>And Honour of such adamantine Proof,<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>As even CORRUPTION, hopeless, and o'er-aw'd,</L>
<L>Durst not have tempted. Yet of Manners mild,</L>
<L>And winning every Heart, he knew to please,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Nobly to please; while equally he scorn'd</L>
<L>Or Adulation to receive, or give.<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>Happy the State! where wakes a ruling Eye</L>
<L>Of such Inspection keen, and general Care.</L>
<L>Beneath a Guard so vigilant, so pure,</L>
<L>All-trusted, All-rever'd, and All-belov'd,</L>
<L>Toil may resign his careless Head to Rest,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>And ever-jealous FREEDOM sleep in Peace.</L>
<L>Ah! lost untimely! lost in <HI>downward</HI> Days!</L>
<L>And many a Patriot Counsel with him lost!</L>
<L>Counsels, that might have humbled BRITAIN's Foe,</L>
<L>Her <HI>native</HI> Foe, from eldest Time by Fate<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>Appointed, as did once a TALBOT's Arms.</L>
<L>Let Learning, Arts, let universal Worth,</L>
<L>Lament a Patron lost, a Friend and Judge.</L>
<L>Unlike the Sons of Vanity, that, veil'd</L>
<L>Beneath the Patron's prostituted Name,<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Dare sacrifice a worthy Man to Pride,</L>
<L>And flush Confusion o'er an honest Cheek.</L>
<L>Oblig'd when he oblig'd, it seem'd a Debt</L>
<L>Which He to Merit, to the Public, paid,</L>
<L>That can, alone, by Virtue, station'd high,<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L><HI>Recover</HI> Fame; to his own Heart a Debt,</L>
<L>And to the great all-bounteous Source of Good.</L>
<L>The gracious Flood, that chears the letter'd World,</L>
<L>Is not the noisy Gift of Summer's Noon,</L>
<L>Whose sudden Current, from the naked Root,<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>Washes the little Soil which yet remain'd,</L>
<L>And only more dejects the blushing Flowers:</L>
<L>No, 'tis the soft-descending Dews at Eve,</L>
<L>The silent Treasures of the vernal Year,</L>
<L>Indulging deep their Stores, the still Night long;<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>Till, with returning Morn, the freshen'd World</L>
<L>Is Fragrance all, all Beauty, Joy and Song.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Still let me view him in the pleasing Light</L>
<L>Of private Life, where Pomp forgets to glare,</L>
<L>And where the plain unguarded Soul is seen.<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>Not only There most amiable, best,</L>
<L>But with that truest Greatness He appear'd,</L>
<L>Which thinks not of appearing; kindly veil'd</L>
<L>In the soft Graces of the friendly Scene,</L>
<L>Inspiring social Confidence and Ease.<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>As free the Converse of the Wise and Good,</L>
<L>As joyous, disentangling every Power,</L>
<L>And breathing mixt Improvement with Delight,</L>
<L>As when amid the various-blossom'd Spring,</L>
<L>Or gentle-beaming Autumn's pensive Shade,<MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>The Philosophic Mind with Nature talks.</L>
<L>Say, ye his SONS, his dear Remains, with Whom</L>
<L>The Father laid superfluous State aside,</L>
<L>Yet swell'd your filial Duty thence the more,</L>

With Friendship swell'd it, with Esteem, with Love,<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>Beyond the Ties of Blood, oh! speak the Joy,</L>
<L>The pure Serene, the chearful Wisdom mild,</L>
<L>The virtuous Spirit, which his vacant Hours,</L>
<L>In Semblance of Amusement, thro' the Breast</L>
<L>Infus'd. And thou, O RUNDLE! lend thy strain,<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>Thou darling Friend! thou Brother of his Soul!</L>
<L>In whom the Head and Heart their Stores unite,</L>
<L>Whatever Fancy paints, Invention pours,</L>
<L>Judgment digests, the well-tun'd Bosom feels,</L>
<L>Truth natural moral or divine has taught,<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>The Virtues dictate, or the Muses sing.</L>
<L>Lend me the Plaint, which, to the lonely Main,</L>
<L>With Memory conversing, you will pour,</L>
<L>As on the pebbled Shore you, pensive, stray,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Derry</HI>'s Mountains a bleak Crescent form,<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>And mid their ample Round receive the Waves,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
That from the frozen Pole, resounding, rush,</L>
<L>Impetuous. Tho' from native Sun-shine driven,</L>
<L>Driven from your Friends, the Sun-shine of the Soul,</L>

<L>Jealous of Worth; yet will you bless your Lot,</L>

<L>Nurs'd, by Experience, into slow Esteem,<MILESTONE N="250"/></L>
<L>Calm Confidence unbounded, Love not blind,</L>
<L>And the sweet Light from mingled Minds disclos'd,</L>
<L>From mingled Chymic Oils as bursts the Fire.</L>
<L>I too remember well that mental Bowl,</L>
<L>Which round his Table flow'd. The Serious, There,<MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>Mix'd with the Sportive, with the Learn'd the Plain:</L>
<L>Mirth soften'd Wisdom, Candor temper'd Mirth;</L>

Not simple Nature's unaffected Sons,</L>

<L>In sunny Lawn or shady Covert set,</L>
<L>Hold more unspotted Converse: nor, of old,</L>

<L>But far beyond the little vulgar Bounds<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>Of Family, of Friends, of Country, Kind,</L>

<L>Of free Access, and of engaging Grace,<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>

Such as a Brother to a Brother owes,</L>

<L>Thus to a dread Inheritance, MY LORD,</L>

<L>It will, thro' latest Time, enrich your Race,</L>

<L>Mean-time these noblest Honours of the Mind</L>
