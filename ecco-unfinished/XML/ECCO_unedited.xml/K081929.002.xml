<HEAD>To the Right HONOURABLE
JOHN,
Lord Viscount TYRCONNEL, Baron CHARLE∣VILLE,
and Lord BROWNLOWE, Knight of
the BATH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PART of this Poem had the honour
of your Lordship's perusal when in ma∣nuscript,
and it was no small pride to
me, when it met with approbation from
so distinguishing a judge: Should the rest
find the like indulgence, I shall have no
occasion (whatever its success may be in
the world) to repent the labour it has cost
me—But my intention is not to pursue a
discourse on my own performance; no, my
Lord, it is to embrace this opportunity of
throwing out sentiments that relate to
your Lordship's goodness, the generosity of
which, give me leave to say, I have greatly
experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
I offer it not as a new remark, that de∣pendance
on the Great, in former times,
generally terminated in disappoinment; nay,
even their bounty (if it could be called
such) was, in its very nature, ungenerous.
It was, perhaps, with-held, through an in∣dolent
or wilful neglect, 'till those, who
lingered in the want of it, grew almost past
the sense of comfort. At length it came,
too often, in a manner that half cancelled
the obligation, and, perchance, must have
been acquired too by some previous act of
guilt in the receiver, the consequence of
which was remorse and infamy.</P>
<P>But that I live, my Lord, is a proof
that dependance on your Lordship, and the
present Ministry, is an assurance of success.
I am persuaded, distress, in many other
instances, affects your soul with a com∣passion,
that always shews itself in a manner
most humane and active; that to forgive
injuries, and confer benefits, is your de∣light;
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
and that to deserve your friendship
is to deserve the countenance of the best of
men. To be admitted into the honour of
your Lordship's conversation (permit me
to speak but justice) is to be elegantly in∣troduced
into the most instructive, as well
as entertaining, parts of literature; it is to
be furnished with the finest observations
upon human nature, and to receive, from
the most unassuming, sweet, and winning
candour, the worthiest and most polite
maxims—such as are always enforced by
the actions of your own life. I could also
take notice of your many public-spirited
services to your country in Parliament, and
your constant attachment to Liberty, and
the Royal, Illustrious House of our Most
Gracious Sovereign; but, my Lord, be∣lieve
me, your own deeds are the noblest
and fittest orators to speak your praise,
and will elevate it far beyond the power
of a much abler writer than I am.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
I will therefore turn my view from your
Lordship's virtues to the kind influence of
them, which has been so lately shed upon
me; and then, if my future morals and
writings shall gain any approbation from
men of parts and probity, I must acknow∣ledge
all to be the product of your Lord∣ship's
goodness to me. I must, in fine,
say with Horace,</P>
<P>Quod spiro, &amp; placeo, (si placeo) tuum est.</P>
<P>I am, with the highest gratitude and
veneration,</P>
<CLOSER>MY LORD,
Your Lordship's most dutiful
And devoted servant,
<SIGNED>RICHARD SAVAGE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>Yet, the' unequal to a soul like thine,</L>
<L>A generous soul, approaching to divine,</L>
<L>When bless'd beneath such patronage I write,</L>
<L>Great my attempt, tho' hazardous my flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er ample Nature I extend my views;</L>
<L>Nature to rural scenes invites the muse:</L>
<L>She flies all public care, all venal strife,</L>
<L>To try the still, compar'd with active life;</L>

<L>Of sea, land, air, and heav'n, and human kind;</L>
<L>What tides of passion in the bosom roll;</L>
<L>What thoughts debase, and what exalt the soul,</L>

<L>All thou survey'st, with a creative skill!</L>
<L>Oh, leave awhile thy lov'd, sequester'd shade!</L>
<L>A while in wintry wilds vouchsafe thy aid!</L>
<L>Then waft me to some olive, bow'ry green,</L>
<L>Where, cloath'd in white, thou shew'st a mind serene;</L>
<L>Where kind Content from noise and court retires,</L>
<L>And smiling sits, while muses tune their lyres:</L>
<L>Where zephyrs gently breathe, while Sleep profound</L>
<L>To their soft fanning nods, with poppies crown'd;</L>
<L>Sleep, on a treasure of bright dreams reclines,</L>
<L>By thee bestow'd; whence Fancy colour'd shines,</L>

<L>Varying her plumes in visionary light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The solar fires now faint and wat'ry burn,</L>
<L>Just where with ice Aquarius frets his urn!</L>
<L>If thaw'd, forth issue, from its mouth severe,</L>
<L>Raw clouds, that sadden all th' inverted year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Frost and Fire with martial pow'rs engag'd,</L>
<L>Frost, northward, fled the war, unequal wag'd!</L>
<L>Beneath the Pole his legions urg'd their flight,</L>
<L>And gain'd a cave profound and wide as night.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
O'er cheerless scenes by Desolation own'd,</L>
<L>High on an Alp of ice he sits enthron'd!</L>
<L>One clay-cold hand, his crystal beard sustains,</L>
<L>And scepter'd one, o'er wind and tempest reigns;</L>
<L>O'er stony magazines of hail, that storm</L>
<L>The blossom'd fruit, and flow'ry Spring deform.</L>
<L>His languid eyes, like frozen lakes appear,</L>
<L>Dim-gleaming all the light that wanders here.</L>
<L>His robe snow-wrought, and hoar'd with age; his breath</L>
<L>A nitrous damp, that strikes petrific death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far hence lies, ever freez'd, the northern main,</L>
<L>That checks, and renders navigation vain;</L>
<L>That, shut against the sun's dissolving ray,</L>
<L>Scatters the trembling tides of vanquish'd day,</L>
<L>And stretching castward half the world secures,</L>
<L>Defies discov'ry, and like time endures!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Frost sent boreal blasts to scourge the air,</L>
<L>To bind the streams, and leave the landscape bare;</L>
<L>Yet when, far west, his violence declines,</L>
<L>Tho' here the brook, or lake, his pow'r confines;</L>
<L>To rocky pools, to cat'racts are unknown</L>
<L>His chains!—to rivers, rapid like the Rhone!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The falling moon cast, cold, a quiv'ring light,</L>
<L>Just silver'd o'er the snow, and sunk!—pale night</L>
<L>Retir'd. The dawn in light-grey mists arose!</L>
<L>Shrill chants the cock!—the hungry heiser lows!</L>
<L>Slow blush yon breaking clouds;—the sun's uproll'd!</L>
<L>Th' expansive grey turns azure, chas'd with gold;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
White-glitt'ring ice, chang'd like the topaz, gleams,</L>
<L>Reflecting saffron lustre from his beams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Contemplation, teach me to explore,</L>
<L>From Britain far remote, some distant shore!</L>
<L>From Sleep a dream distinct and lively claim;</L>
<L>Clear let the vision strike the moral's aim!</L>
<L>It comes! I feel it o'er my soul serene!</L>
<L>Still Morn begins, and Frost retains the scene!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark!—the loud horn's enlivening note's begun!</L>
<L>From rock to vale sweet-wandring echoes run!</L>
<L>Still floats the sound shrill-winding from afar!</L>
<L>Wild beasts astonish'd dread the sylvan war!</L>
<L>Spears to the sun in files embattled play,</L>
<L>March on, charge briskly, and enjoy the fray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Swans, ducks, and geese, and the wing'd winter-brood,</L>
<L>Chatter discordant on yon echoing flood!</L>
<L>At Babel thus, when heav'n the tongue confounds,</L>
<L>Sudden a thousand different jargon-sounds,</L>
<L>Like jangling bells, harsh mingling, grate the ear!</L>
<L>All stare! all talk! all mean; but none cohere!</L>
<L>Mark! wiley fowlers meditate their doom,</L>
<L>And smoaky Fate speeds thund'ring thro' the gloom!</L>
<L>Stop'd short, they cease in airy rings to fly,</L>
<L>Whirl o'er and o'er, and, flutt'ring, fall and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still Fancy wafts me on! deceiv'd I stand,</L>
<L>Estrang'd, advent'rous on a foreign land!</L>
<L>Wide and more wide extends the scene unknown!</L>
<L>Where shall I turn, a WAND'RER, and alone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<L>From hilly wilds, and depths where snows remain,</L>
<L>My winding steps up a steep mountain strain!</L>
<L>Emers'd a-top, I mark, the hills subside,</L>
<L>And tow'rs aspire, but with inferior pride!</L>
<L>On this bleak height tall firs, with ice-work crown'd,</L>
<L>Bend, while their flaky winter shades the ground!</L>
<L>Hoarse, and direct, a blust'ring north-wind blows!</L>
<L>On boughs, thick-rustling, crack the crispid snows!</L>
<L>Tangles of frost half fright the wilder'd eye,</L>
<L>By heat oft blacken'd like a low'ring sky!</L>
<L>Hence down the side two turbid riv'lets pour,</L>
<L>And devious two, in one huge cat'ract, roar!</L>
<L>While pleas'd the wat'ry progress I pursue,</L>
<L>Yon rocks in rough assemblage rush in view!</L>
<L>In form an amphitheatre they rise;</L>
<L>And a dark gulf in their broad centre lies.</L>
<L>There the dim'd sight with dizzy weakness fails,</L>
<L>And horror o'er the firmest brain prevails!</L>
<L>Thither these mountain-streams their passage take,</L>
<L>Headlong foam down, and form a dreadful lake!</L>
<L>The lake, high-swelling, so redundant grows,</L>
<L>From the heap'd store deriv'd, a river flows;</L>
<L>Which, deep'ning, travels through a distant wood,</L>
<L>And thence emerging, meets a sister-flood;</L>
<L>Mingled they flash on a wide-opening plain,</L>
<L>And pass yon city to the far-seen main.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So blend two souls by heav'n for union made,</L>
<L>And strength'ning forward, lend a mutual aid,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
And prove in ev'ry transient turn their aim,</L>
<L>Thro' finite life to infinite the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor ends the landscape—Ocean, to my sight,</L>
<L>Points a blue arm, where sailing ships delight,</L>
<L>In prospect lessen'd!—Now new rocks, rear'd high,</L>
<L>Stretch a cross-ridge, and bar the curious eye;</L>
<L>There lies obscur'd the ripening diamond's ray,</L>
<L>And thence red-branching coral's rent away.</L>
<L>In conic form there gelid crystal grows;</L>
<L>Thro' such the palace-lamp, gay lustre throws!</L>
<L>Lustre, which, thro' dim night, as various plays</L>
<L>As play from yonder snows the changeful rays!</L>
<L>For nobler use the crystal's worth may rise;</L>
<L>If tubes perspective hem the spotless prize;</L>
<L>Thro' these the beams of the far-lengthen'd eye</L>
<L>Measure known stars, and new remoter spy.</L>
<L>Hence Commerce many a shorten'd voyage steers,</L>
<L>Shorten'd to months, the hazard once of years;</L>
<L>Hence Halley's soul etherial flight essays;</L>
<L>Instructive there from orb to orb she strays;</L>
<L>Sees, round new countless suns, new systems roll!</L>
<L>Sees God in all! and magnifies the whole!</L>
<L>Yon rocky side enrich'd the summer scene,</L>
<L>And peasant's search for herbs of healthful green;</L>
<L>Now naked, pale, and comfortless it lies,</L>
<L>Like youth extended cold in death's disguise.</L>
<L>There, while without the sounding tempest swells,</L>
<L>Incav'd secure th' exulting eagle dwells;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
And there, when Nature owns prolific spring,</L>
<L>Spreads o'er her young a fondling mother's wing.</L>
<L>Swains on the coast the far-fam'd fish descry,</L>
<L>That gives the fleecy robe the Tyrian dye;</L>
<L>While shells, a scatter'd ornament bestow,</L>
<L>The tinctur'd rivals of the show'ry bow.</L>
<L>Yon limeless sands, loose-driving with the wind,</L>
<L>In future cauldrons useful texture find,</L>
<L>Till, on the furnace thrown, the glowing mass</L>
<L>Brightens, and bright'ning hardens into glass.</L>
<L>When winter halcyons, flick'ring on the wave,</L>
<L>Tune their complaints, yon sea forgets to rave;</L>
<L>Tho' lash'd by storms, which naval pride o'erturn,</L>
<L>The foaming deep in sparkles seems to burn,</L>
<L>Loud winds turn zephyrs to enlarge their notes,</L>
<L>And each safe nest on a calm surface floats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now veers the wind full east; and keen, and sore,</L>
<L>Its cutting influence aches in ev'ry pore!</L>
<L>How weak thy fabric, Man!—A puff, thus blown,</L>
<L>Staggers thy strength, and echoes to thy groan.</L>
<L>A tooth's minutest nerve let anguish seize,</L>
<L>Swift kindred fibres catch! (so frail our case!)</L>
<L>Pinch'd, piere'd, and torn, enslam'd, and unassuag'd,</L>
<L>They smart, and swell, and throb, and shoot enrag'd!</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om nerve to nerve fierce flies th' exulting pain!</L>
<L>—And are we of this mighty fabric vain?</L>
<L>Now my blood chills! scarce thro' my veins it glides!</L>
<L>Sure on each blast a shiv'ring ague rides!</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Warn'd, let me this bleak eminence forsake,</L>
<L>And to the vale a diff'rent winding take!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Half I descend: my spirits fast decay;</L>
<L>A terrace now relieves my weary way.</L>
<L>Close with this stage a precipice combines;</L>
<L>Whence still the spacious country far delines!</L>
<L>The herds seem insects in the distant glades,</L>
<L>And men diminish'd, as, at noon, their shades!</L>
<L>Thick on this top o'ergrown for walks are seen</L>
<L>Grey, leafless wood, and winter-greens between!</L>
<L>The red'ning berry, deep-ting'd holly shows,</L>
<L>And matted mistletoe, the white, bestows!</L>
<L>Tho' lost the banquet of autumnal fruits,</L>
<L>Tho' on broad oaks no vernal umbrage shoots;</L>
<L>These boughs, the silenc'd, shiv'ring songsters seek!</L>
<L>These foodful berries fill the hungry beak.</L>

<LG>
<L>Beneath appears a place, all outward bare,</L>
<L>Inward the dreary mansion of Despair!</L>
<L>The water of the mountain-road, half-stray'd,</L>
<L>Breaks o'er it wild, and falls a brown cascade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Has Nature this rough, naked piece design'd,</L>
<L>To hold inhabitants of mortal kind?</L>
<L>She has. Approach'd, appears a deep descent,</L>
<L>Which opens in a rock a large extent!</L>
<L>And hark!—its hollow entrance reach'd, I hear</L>
<L>A trampling sound of footsteps hast'ning near!</L>
<L>A death-like chillness thwarts my panting breast:</L>
<L>Soft! the wish'd object stands at length confest!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Of youth his form!—But why with anguish bent?</L>
<L>Why pin'd with sallow marks of discontent?</L>
<L>Yet Patience, lab'ring to beguile his care,</L>
<L>Seems to raise hope, and smiles away despair.</L>
<L>Compassion, in his eye, surveys my grief,</L>
<L>And in his voice invites me to relief.</L>
<L>Preventive of thy call, behold my haste,</L>
<L>(He says,) nor let warm thanks thy spirits waste!</L>
<L>All fear forget—Each portal I possess,</L>
<L>Duty wide-opens to receive distress.</L>
<L>Oblig'd, I follow, by his guidance led;</L>
<L>The vaulted roof re-echoing to our tread!</L>
<L>And now, in squar'd divisions, I survey</L>
<L>Chambers sequester'd from the glare of day;</L>
<L>Yet needful lights are taught to intervene,</L>
<L>Thro' rifts; each forming a perspective scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In front a parlour meets my ent'ring view;</L>
<L>Oppos'd, a room to sweet refection due.</L>
<L>Here my chill'd veins are warm'd by chippy fires,</L>
<L>Thro' the bor'd rock above, the smoke expires;</L>
<L>Neat, o'er a homely board, a napkin's spread,</L>
<L>Crown'd with a heapy canister of bread.</L>
<L>A maple cup is next dispatch'd, to bring</L>
<L>The comfort of the salutary spring:</L>
<L>Nor mourn we absent blessings of the vine,</L>
<L>Here laughs a frugal bowl of rosy wine;</L>
<L>And fav'ry cates, upon clear embers cast,</L>
<L>Lie hissing, till snatch'd off; a rich repast!</L>

Soon leap my spirits with enliven'd pow'r,</L>
<L>And in gay converse glides the feastful hour.</L>

<L>On me, yon city, kind, bestows her care:</L>
<L>Meat for keen famine, and the gen'rous juice,</L>
<L>That warms chill'd life, her charities produce:</L>
<L>Accept without reward; unask'd 'twas mine;</L>
<L>Here what thy health requires, as free be thine.</L>
<L>Hence learn that GOD, (who, in the time of need,</L>
<L>In frozen desarts can the raven feed)</L>
<L>Well-sought, will delegate some pitying breast,</L>
<L>His second means, to succour man distrest.</L>
<L>He paus'd. Deep thought upon his aspect gloom'd;</L>
<L>Then he, with smile humane, his voice resum'd.</L>
<L>I'm just inform'd, (and laugh me not to scorn)</L>
<L>By one unseen by thee, thou'rt English-born.</L>
<L>Of England I—To me the British state</L>

<L>When in a swimming trance my pangs were drown'd.</L>
<L>Still farther off she call'd—With soft surprize,</L>

<L>Short, shorter, shorter yet, my breath I drew:</L>
<L>Then up my strugling soul unburthen'd flew.</L>
<L>Thus from a state, where sin, and grief abide,</L>
<L>Heav'n summon'd me to mercy—thus I died.</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will easily perceive these
verses were begun, when my heart was
gayer than it has been of late; and finished
in hours of the deepest melancholy.</P>
<P>I hope the world will do me the justice
to believe, that no part of this flows from
any real anger against the Lady, to whom
it is inscribed. Whatever undeserved seve∣rities
I may have received at her hands,
would she deal so candidly as acknowledge
truth, she very well knows, by an expe∣rience
of many years, that I have ever be∣haved
myself towards her, like one who
thought it his duty to support with patience
all afflictions from that quarter. Indeed,
if I had not been capable of forgiving a
Mother, I must have blushed to receive par∣don
myself at the hands of my Sovereign.</P>
<P>Neither, to say the truth, were the man∣ner
of my birth all, should I have any
reason for complaint—When I am a little
disposed to a gay turn of thinking. I con∣sider,
as I was a Derelict from my cradle,
I have honour of a lawful claim to the best
protection in Europe. For being a spot
of earth, to which nobody pretends a title,
I devolve naturally upon the King, as one
of the rights of his Royalty.</P>
<P><PB REF="90"/>
While I presume to name his Majesty,
I look back, with confusion, upon the
mercy I have lately experienced; because
it is impossible to remember it, but with
something I would fain forget, for the sake
of my future peace, and alleviation of my
past misfortune.</P>
<P>I owe my life to the Royal Pity, if a
wretch can, with propriety, be said to live,
whose days are fewer than his sorrows;
and to whom death had beeen but a re∣demption
from misery.</P>
<P>But I will suffer my pardon as my pu∣nishment,
till that life, which has so gra∣ciously
been given me, shall become con∣siderable
enough not to be useless in his
service to whom it was forfeited. Under
influence of these sentiments, with which
His Majesty's great goodness has inspired
me, I consider my loss of fortune and dig∣nity
as my happiness; to which, as I am
born without ambition, I am thrown from
them without repining—Possessing those
advantages, my care had been, perhaps,
but how to enjoy life; by the want of them
I am taught this nobler lesson, to study
how to deserve it.</P>

A
POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN gayer hours, when high my fancy ran,</L>
<L>The muse, exulting, thus her lay began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest be the Bastard's birth! thro' wond'rous ways,</L>
<L>He shines eccentric like a comet's blaze!</L>
<L>No sickly fruit of faint compliance He!</L>
<L>He! stampt in nature's mint of ecstasy!</L>
<L>He lives to build, not boast a generous race:</L>
<L>No tenth transmitter of a foolish face.</L>
<L>His daring hope, no fire's example bounds;</L>
<L>His first-born lights, no prejudice confounds.</L>
<L>He, kindling from within, requires no flame;</L>
<L>He glories in a Bastard's glowing name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Born to himself, by no possession led,</L>
<L>In freedom foster'd, and by fortune fed;</L>
<L>Nor guides, nor rules, his sov'reign choice control,</L>
<L>His body independent as his soul;</L>
<L>Loos'd to the world's wide range—enjoin'd no aim,</L>
<L>Prescrib'd no duty, and assign'd no name:</L>
<L>Nature's unbounded son, he stands alone,</L>
<L>His heart unbiass'd, and his mind his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
<L>O Mother, yet no Mother!—'tis to you,</L>
<L>My thanks for such distinguish'd claims are due.</L>
<L>You, unenslav'd to Nature's narrow laws,</L>
<L>Warm championess for freedom's sacred cause,</L>
<L>From all the dry devoirs of blood and line,</L>
<L>From ties maternal, moral and divine,</L>
<L>Discharg'd my grasping soul; push'd me from shore,</L>
<L>And launch'd me into life without an oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What had I lost, if conjugally kind,</L>
<L>By nature hating, yet by vows confin'd,</L>
<L>Untaught the matrimonial bounds to slight,</L>
<L>And coldly conscious of a husband's right,</L>
<L>You had faint-drawn me with a form alone,</L>
<L>A lawful lump of life by force your own!</L>
<L>Then, while your backward will retrench'd desire,</L>
<L>And unconcurring spirits lent no fire,</L>
<L>I had been born your dull, domestic heir,</L>
<L>Load of your life, and motive of your care;</L>
<L>Perhaps been poorly rich, and meanly great,</L>
<L>The slave of pomp, a cypher in the state;</L>
<L>Lordly neglectful of a worth unknown,</L>
<L>And slumb'ring in a feat, by chance my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far nobler blessings wait the Bastard's lot;</L>
<L>Conceiv'd in rapture, and with fire begot!</L>
<L>Strong as necessity, he starts away,</L>
<L>Climbs against wrongs, and brightens into day.</L>

Inly secure, thro' conscious scorn of ill,</L>
<L>Nor taught by wisdom, how to ballance will.</L>
<L>Rashly deceiv'd, I saw no pits to shun,</L>
<L>But thought to purpose, and to act were one;</L>
<L>Heedless what pointed cares pervert his way,</L>
<L>Whom caution arms not, and whom woes betray;</L>
<L>But now expos'd, and shrinking from distress,</L>
<L>I fly to shelter, while the tempests press;</L>
<L>My Muse to grief resigns the varying tone,</L>
<L>The raptures languish, and the numbers groan.</L>

<L>O memory! thou soul of joy and pain!</L>
<L>Thou actor of our passions o'er again!</L>
<L>Why dost thou aggravate the wretch's woe?</L>
<L>Why add continuous smart to ev'ry blow?</L>
<L>Few are my joys; alas! how soon forgot!</L>
<L>On that kind quarter thou invad'st me not:</L>
<L>While sharp, and numberless my sorrows fall;</L>
<L>Yet thou repeat'st, and multiply'st 'em all!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is chance a guilt? that my disast'rous heart,</L>
<L>For mischief never meant, must ever smart?</L>
<L>Can self-defence be sin?—Ah, plead no more!</L>
<L>What tho' no purpos'd malice stain'd thee o'er?</L>
<L>Had heav'n befriended thy unhappy side,</L>
<L>Thou had'st not been provok'd—Or thou had'st died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all</L>
<L>On whom, unsought, embroiling dangers fall!</L>
<L>Still the pale Dead revives, and lives to me,</L>
<L>To me! thro' Pity's eye condemn'd to see.</L>

Remembrance veils his rage, but swells his fate;</L>
<L>Griev'd I forgive, and am grown cool too late.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>O fate of late repentance! always vain:</L>
<L>Thy remedies but lull undying pain.</L>
<L>Where shall my hope find rest?—No Mother's care</L>
<L>Shielded my infant innocence with pray'r:</L>
<L>No Father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd,</L>
<L>Call'd forth my virtues, or from vice restrain'd.</L>
<L>Is it not thine to snatch some pow'rful arm,</L>
<L>First to advance, then skreen from future harm?</L>
<L>I am return'd from death, to live in pain?</L>
<L>Or wou'd Imperial Pity save in vain?</L>
<L>Distrust it not—What blame can Mercy find,</L>
<L>Which gives at once a life, and rears a mind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mother, miscall'd, farewell—of soul severe,</L>
<L>This sad reflection yet may force one tear:</L>
<L>All I was wretched by to you I ow'd,</L>
<L>Alone from strangers ev'ry comfort flow'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lost to the life you gave, your Son no more,</L>
<L>And now adopted, who was doom'd before,</L>

New-born, I may a nobler Mother claim,</L>
<L>But dare not whisper her immortal name;</L>
<L>Supremely lovely, and serenely great!</L>
<L>Majestic Mother of a kneeling State!</L>
<L>QUEEN of a People's heart, who ne'er before</L>

<L>Such paint what pity veils in private woes,</L>

<L>Far from these tracks my honest lays aspire,</L>

<L>Your Queen, your Venus, and your Clio's here!</L>
<L>In such pure sires her rising thoughts refine!</L>

<L>Let the dull artist puzzling rules explore,</L>

<L>You eye the soul—there genuine nature find,</L>
<L>You, thro' the meaning muscles, strike the mind.</L>

<L>Nor can one view such boundless pow'r confine,</L>

<L>There long-lost cities rear their ancient pride!</L>
<L>You from the grave can half redeem the slain,</L>
<L>And bid great Julius charm the world again:</L>
<L>Mark out Pharsalia's, mark out Munda's fray,</L>
<L>And image all the honours of the day.</L>

<L>But if new glories most our warmth excite;</L>
<L>If toils untry'd to noblest aims invite;</L>
<L>Would you in envy'd pomp unrivall'd reign,</L>
<L>Oh, let Horatius grace the canvass plain!</L>
<L>His form might ev'n idolatry create,</L>
<L>In lineage, titles, wealth, and worth elate!</L>
<L>Empires to him might virgin honours owe,</L>
<L>From him arts, arms, and laws new influence know.</L>
<L>For him kind suns on fruits and grains shall shine,</L>
<L>And future gold lie rip'ning in the mine:</L>
<L>For him fine marble in the quarry lies,</L>
<L>Which, in due statues, to his fame shall rise.</L>
<L>Thro' those bright features Caesar's spirit trace,</L>
<L>Each conq'ring sweetness, each imperial grace,</L>
<L>All that is soft, or eminently great,</L>
<L>In love, in war, in knowledge, or in state.</L>

<L>Thus shall you charm, enrich'd with Clio's praise!</L>
<L>Clear, and more clear, your golden genius shines,</L>

<HEAD>FULVIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LET Fulvia's wisdom be a slave to will,</L>
<L>Her darling passions, scandal and quadrille;</L>
<L>On friends and foes her tongue a satire known,</L>
<L>Her deeds a satire on herself alone.</L>
<L>On her poor kindred deigns she word or look?</L>
<L>'Tis cold respect, or 'tis unjust rebuke;</L>
<L>Worse when goodnatur'd than when most severe;</L>
<L>The jest impure then pains the modest ear.</L>
<L>How just the sceptic? the divine how odd?</L>
<L>What turns of wit play smartly on her God?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fates, my nearest kindred, foes decree:</L>
<L>Fulvia, when piqu'd at them, strait pities me.</L>
<L>She, like benevolence, a smile bestows,</L>
<L>Favours to me indulge her spleen to those.</L>
<L>The banquet serv'd, with peeresses I sit:</L>
<L>She tells my story, and repeats my wit.</L>
<L>With mouth distorted, thro' a sounding nose</L>
<L>It comes, now homeliness more homely grows.</L>
<L>With see-saw sounds and nonsense not my own,</L>
<L>She skrews her features, and she cracks her tone.</L>
<L>How fine your Bastard? why so soft a strain?</L>
<L>What such a Mother? satirize again!</L>

<L>Oft I object—but fix'd is Fulvia's will—</L>
<L>Ah! tho' unkind, she is my mother still!</L>

<L>The verse now flows, the manuscript she claims.</L>
<L>'Tis fam'd—The fame, each curious fair enflames:</L>
<L>The wild-fire runs; from copy, copy grows:</L>
<L>The Brets alarm'd, a sep'rate peace propose.</L>
<L>'Tis ratified—How alter'd Fulvia's look?</L>
<L>My wit's degraded, and my cause forsook.</L>
<L>Thus she: What's poetry but to amuse?</L>
<L>Might I advise—there are more solid views.</L>
<L>With a cool air she adds: This tale is old:</L>
<L>Were it my case, it should no more be told.</L>
<L>Complaints—had I been worthy to advise—</L>
<L>You know—But when are wits, like women, wise?</L>
<L>True it may take, but think whate'er you list,</L>
<L>All love the satire, none the satirist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I start, I stare, stand fix'd, then pause awhile;</L>
<L>Then hesitate, then ponder well, then smile.</L>
<L>Madam—a pension lost—and where's amends?</L>
<L>Sir (she replies) indeed you'll lose your friends.</L>
<L>Why did I start? 'twas but a change of wind—</L>
<L>Or the same thing—the lady chang'd her mind.</L>
<L>I bow, depart, despise, discern her all:</L>
<L>Nanny revisits, and disgrac'd I fall.</L>

<LG>
<L>Let Fulvia's friendship whirl with ev'ry whim!</L>
<L>A reed, a weather-cock, a shade, a dream:</L>
<L>No more the friendship shall be now display'd</L>
<L>By weather-cock, or reed, or dream, or shade;</L>
<L>To Nanny fix'd unvarying shall it tend,</L>
<L>For souls, so form'd alike, were form'd to blend.</L>

<L>Come purest atoms! Beauty aid implores;</L>

<L>They come, they croud, they shining hues unfold,</L>
<L>Be theirs a form, which Beauty's self shall mould!</L>
<L>To mould my charmer's form she all apply'd—</L>
<L>Whence Cambria boasts the birth of Nature's pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She calls the Graces—Such is Beauty's state,</L>
<L>Prompt, at her call, th' obedient Graces wait.</L>
<L>First your fair feet they shape, and shape to please;</L>
<L>Each stands design'd for dignity and ease.</L>
<L>Firm, on these curious pedestals, depend</L>
<L>Two polish'd pillars; which, as fair, ascend;</L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="195"/>
From well-wrought knees, more fair, more large, they rise;</L>
<L>Seen by the muse, tho' hid from mortal eyes.</L>
<L>More polish'd yet, your fabric each sustains;</L>
<L>That purest temple where perfection reigns.</L>
<L>A small, sweet circle forms your faultless waist,</L>
<L>By Beauty shap'd, to be by Love embrac'd.</L>
<L>Beyond that less'ning waist, two orbs devise,</L>
<L>What swelling charms, in fair proportion, rise!</L>
<L>Fresh-peeping there, two blushing buds are found,</L>
<L>Each like a rose, which lilies white surround.</L>
<L>There feeling sense, let pitying sighs inspire,</L>
<L>'Till panting pity swells to warm desire:</L>
<L>Desire, tho' warm, is chaste; each warmest kiss,</L>
<L>All rapture chaste. when Hymen bids the bliss.</L>
<L>Rounding and soft, two taper arms descend;</L>
<L>Two snow-white hands, in taper fingers, end.</L>
<L>Lo! cunning Beauty, on each palm, designs</L>
<L>Love's fortune and your own, in mystic lines;</L>
<L>And lovely whiteness, either arm contains,</L>
<L>Diversified with azure-wand'ring veins;</L>
<L>The wand'ring veins conceal a gen'rous flood,</L>
<L>The purple treasure of celestial blood.</L>
<L>Rounding and white your neck, as curious, rears</L>
<L>O'er all a face, where Beauty's self appears.</L>
<L>Her soft attendants smooth the spotless skin,</L>
<L>And, smoothly-oval, turn the shapely chin;</L>
<L><PB N="199" REF="196"/>
The shapely chin, to Beauty's rising face,</L>
<L>Shall, doubling gently, give a double grace,</L>
<L>And soon sweet-opening, rosy lips disclose</L>
<L>The well-rang'd teeth, in lily-whitening rows;</L>
<L>Here life is breath'd, and florid life assumes</L>
<L>A breath, whose fragrance vies with vernal blooms.;</L>
<L>And two fair checks give modesty to raise</L>
<L>A beauteous blush at praise, tho' just the praise.</L>
<L>And nature now, from each kind ray, supplies</L>
<L>Soft, clement smiles, and love-inspiring eyes;</L>
<L>New Graces, to those eyes, mild shades, allow;</L>
<L>Fringe their fair lids, and pencil either brow.</L>
<L>While sense of vision lights up orbs so rare,</L>
<L>May none, but pleasing objects, visit there!</L>
<L>Two little porches, (which, one sense empow'rs,</L>
<L>To draw rich scent from aromatic flow'rs)</L>
<L>In structure neat, and deck'd with polish'd grace,</L>
<L>Shall equal first, then heighten Beauty's face.</L>
<L>To smelling sense, oh, may the slow'ry year,</L>
<L>It's first, last, choicest incense, offer here.</L>
<L>Transparent next, two curious crescents bound</L>
<L>The two-fold entrance of inspiring sound,</L>
<L>And, granting a new power of sense to hear,</L>
<L>New finer organs form each curious ear;</L>

<L>And, as you move, each movement is delight.</L>
<L>Tun'd is your melting tongue and equal mind,</L>
<L>At once by knowledge heighten'd and refin'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>The Virtues next to Beauty's nod incline;</L>

<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE THE
EARL OF MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT elegant taste in poetry, which
is hereditary to your Lordship, together
with that particular regard with which you
honour the author to whom these papers
relate, make me imagine this collection
may not be unpleasing to you. And I may
presume to say, the pieces themselves are
not unworthy your Lordship's patronage,
my own part in it excepted. I speak only
of THE AUTHOR TO BE LET, having no
title to any other, not even the small ones
out of the Journals. May I be permitted
to declare (to the end I may seem not quite
so unworthy of your Lordship's favour,
as some writers of my age and circumstan∣ces)
that I never was concern'd in any
<PB N="240" REF="235"/>
Journals. I ever thought the exorbitant
liberty, which most of those papers take
with their superiors, unjustifiable in any
rank of men; but detestable in such, who
do it merely for hire, and without even
the bad excuse of passion and resentment.
On the contrary, being once inclined, upon
some advantageous proposals, to enter into
a paper of another kind, I immediately de∣sisted,
on finding admitted into it (though,
as the publisher told me, purely by an
accident) two or three lines reflecting on a
great minister. Were my life ever so un∣happy,
it shall not be stain'd with a con∣duct,
which my birth at least (though
neither my education nor good fortune)
should set me above; much less with any
ingratitude to that noble person, to whose
intercession (next to his Majesty's goodness)
I owe in a great measure that life itself.</P>
<LG>
<L>—Nec si miserum fortuna sinonem</L>
<L>Finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="241" REF="236"/>
I believe your Lordship will pardon this
digression, or any other which keeps me
from the style you so much hate—of Dedi∣cation.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to display those rising
virtues in your Lordship, which the next
age will certainly know without my help,
but rather relate (what else it will as cer∣tainly
be ignorant of) the history of these
papers, and the occasion which produced
the War of the Dunces (for so it has been
commonly call'd) which begun in the Year
1727, and ended in 1730.</P>
<P>When Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope thought
it proper, for reasons specified in the pre∣face
to their miscellanies, to publish some
little pieces of theirs as had casually got
abroad, there was added to them the Trea∣tise
of the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking
in Poetry. It happened, that in one chap∣ter
of this piece, the several species of bad
poets were ranged in classes, to which were
prefixed almost all the letters of the alpha∣bet
<PB N="242" REF="237"/>
(the greatest part of them at random);
but such was the number of poets eminent
in that art, that some one or other took
every letter to himself: All fell into so
violent a fury, that for half a year or more,
the common news-papers (in most of which
they had some property, as being hired
writers) were filled with the most abusive
falshoods and scurrilities they could possi∣bly
devise. A liberty no way to be won∣dered
at in those people, and in those pa∣pers,
that, for many years during the un∣controled
licence of the press, had aspersed
almost all the great characters of the age;
and this with impunity, their own persons
and names being utterly secret and obscure.</P>
<P>This gave Mr. Pope the thought, that
he had now some opportunity of doing
good, by detecting and dragging into
light these common enemies of mankind;
since to invalidate this universal slander, it
sufficed to shew what contemptible men
were the authors of it. He was not with∣out
<PB N="243" REF="238"/>
hopes, that, by manifesting the dullness
of those who had only malice to recommend
them, either the booksellers would not find
their account in employing them, or the
men themselves, when discovered, want
courage to proceed in so unlawful an occu∣pation.
This it was that gave birth to The
Dunciad, and he thought it an happiness,
that by the late flood of slander on him∣self,
he had acquired such a peculiar right
over their names as was necessary to this
design.</P>
<P>On the 12th of March 1729, at St.
James's, that poem was presented to the
King and Queen (who had before been
pleased to read it) by the right honourable
Sir Robert Walpole: And some days
after, the whole impression was taken and
dispersed by several noblemen and persons
of the first distinction.</P>
<P>It is certainly a true observation, that no
people are so impatient of censure as those
who are the greatest slanderers; which was
<PB N="244" REF="239"/>
wonderfully exemplified on this occasion.
On the day the book was first vended, a
crowd of authors besieged the shop; en∣treaties,
advices, threats of law, and bat∣tery,
nay cries of treason were all employed,
to hinder the coming out of The Dunciad:
On the other side, the booksellers and
hawkers made as great efforts to procure
it: What could a few poor authors do
against so great a majority as the publick?
there was no stopping a torrent with a fin∣ger,
so out it came.</P>
<P>Many ludicrous circumstances attended
it: The Dunces (for by this name they
were called) held weekly clubs, to consult
of hostilities against the author; one wrote
a letter to a great minister, assuring him
Mr. Pope was the greatest enemy the go∣vernment
had; and another bought his
image in clay, to execute him in effigy;
with which sad sort of satisfactions the
gentlemen were a little comforted.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="240"/>
Some false editions of the book having
an owl in their frontispiece, the true one,
to distinguish it, fixed in its stead an ass
laden with authors. Then another surrep∣titious
one being printed with the same ass,
the new edition in octavo returned for dis∣tinction
to the owl again. Hence arose a
great contest of booksellers against book∣sellers,
and advertisements against adver∣tisements;
some recommending the edition
of the owl, and others the edition of the
ass; by which names they came to be dis∣tinguished,
to the great honour also of the
gentlemen of The Dunciad.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will not think these par∣ticulars
altogether unentertaining; nor are
they impertinent, since they clear some pas∣sages
in the following collection. The
whole cannot but be of some use, to shew
the different spirit with which good and
bad authors have ever acted, as well as
written; and to evince a truth, a greater
than which was never advanced, that—
<Q>Each bad author is as bad a friend.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="241"/>
However, the imperfection of this col∣lection
cannot but be owned, as long as it
wants that poem with which you, my Lord,
have honoured the author of The Dunciad;
but which I durst not presume to add in
your absence. As it is, may it please your
Lordship to accept of it, as a distant tes∣timony,
with what respect and zeal I am,</P>

Your most obedient
And devoted servant,

<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following piece was accidentally drop∣ped
near the Mews-gate. I picked it up in my
way from Charing-cross to Hedge-lane. It was
in a leathern case, which had once been red,
but was grown black with grease, and tied round
with a scrap of dirty tape. When I opened the
parcel, I found by an ingenious epigram, that
this tape had formerly belonged to Mrs. Hay∣wood,
(the divine Eliza!) but whether it had
bound her hair, or was part of her apron-string,
I should have been at a loss to learn, had not
the relict been sanctified by Mr. Moore's muse.
He tritely compared it to Cytherea's girdle,
and sent it as a valuable pledge of friendship to
our author. In this packet were several letters
directed to Mr. Iscariot Hackney, dated from the
Ship-tavern, Charing-cross, and signed J. m. s
M … Sm. th, L. Theobald, L. Welsted, Ed∣mund
Curl, John Dennis, Thomas Cooke,
and Bezaleel Morris. Those of the earliest im∣port,
that J. m. s M … Sm. th, Es{que} was
unanimously chosen speaker of this society. I
met with many more informations of this nature;
<PB N="248" REF="243"/>
but what pleased me most, was the performance
of our author. I was curious to find out so ex∣cellent
a writer, and have entered into a treaty
with him for future memoirs, which I have en∣gaged
to give the public.</P>
<P>It is with much glee that I have marked the
herd bellowing against The Dunciad for indelica∣cies.
Not to mention with what an ill grace
this criticism comes from that quarter, I fancy
it may easily be proved, that the grossest of those
images are most suitable to the subject; a sub∣ject
composed, for the most part, of authors,
whose writings are the refuse of wit, and who in
life are as the very excrement of nature; yet
even here, Mr. Pope shews himself a master.
It is true, that he has used dung; but he dis∣poses
that dung in such a manner, that it
becomes rich manure, from which he raises a
variety of fine flowers. He deals in rags; but
deals with them like an artist, who commits
them to a paper-mill, and brings them out use∣ful
sheets. The chymist extracts a fine cordial
from the most nauseous of all dung, and Mr.
Pope has drawn a sweet poetical spirit from the
most offensive and unpoetical objects of the
creation—unpoetical, though eternal writers of
poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="244"/>
I have also laughed at the clamour of the
gentlemen of the Bathos against The Dunciad,
for insulting them on their poverty. I own that
a man's poverty, when it proceeds not from any
folly, but is owing (as it often happens) to his
virtue, sets him in an amiable light. He be∣comes
the object of compassion; and, if he bears
his misfortunes like a man, instead of falling in∣to
contempt, raises our admiration. But when
his wants are of his own seeking, and prove the
motive of every ill action (for the poverty of bad
authors has always a bad heart for its com∣panion),
is it not a vice, and properly the subject
of satire?</P>
<P>Most of these persons are of a very low pa∣rentage,
and without any pretence of merit are
aspiring to the rank of gentlemen. Thus they
become ill oeconomists; poverty is the conse∣quence
of ill oeconomy, and dirty tricks the
consequence of their poverty. Though they are
sad writers, they might have been good me∣chanics;
and therefore by endeavouring to shine
in spheres to which they are unequal, are guilty
of depriving the public of many that might have
been its useful members.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="245"/>
Methinks when the world is so ungrateful as
not to read their writings, they might vouch∣safe
to follow the example of the great Sir
Walter Raleigh (though an author undoubtedly
inferior to them), who, when he heard the First
Part of his History succeeded not, had spirit
enough to commit the second to the flames.
But the gentlemen of the Bathos are apt, like
bad horses, to run faster immediately after
stumbling. Should the author of the Dunciad
declare, that the great Mr. Dennis (the son of a
sadler) had better have been a common parish∣crier,
than a poet or critic! have not forty
years, and upwards, witnessed the truth of this?
Is it not evident, that his poverty results from a
misapplication of his talents?</P>
<P>Had it not been an honester and more decent
livelihood for Mr. Norton (Daniel de Foe's son
of love, by a lady who vended oysters) to have
dealt in a fish-market, than to be dealing out the
dialects of Billingsgate and detraction in the
Flying Post?</P>
<P>Should not Dick Morley rather have been
blacking shoes at the corners of streets, (to which
it is well known his industrious, and more pru∣dent
younger brother submitted), than blackening
<PB N="251" REF="246"/>
reputations in The History of Mother Wisebourn,
and Weekly Journals? The blackening of the
brush from the japan-pot is so useful and orna∣mental,
that it is frequently called Honour; but
the dash of Dick's pen, so often dipped in an
ink-standish, is dirty, and detrimental, conse∣quently
dishonour; so that Dick and his brother
illustrate St. Paul's saying, “Some are made to
honour, and some to dishonour.”</P>
<P>Had it not been more laudable in Mr. Roome,
the son of an undertaker, to have borne a link,
and a mourning-staff in the long procession of a
funeral, than to have been frequently lamenting
the burials of his miserable, short-lived libels?
Had it not been more decent in him, to have
sung psalms, according to education, in an Ana∣baptist
Meeting, than to have been altering The
Jovial Crew, or Merry Beggars, into a wicked
imitation of The Beggar's Opera?</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Cooke, the translator of Hesiod,
is the son of a Muggletonian-teacher, who kept
a little obscure alehouse at Braintree in Essex.
Though this author has no more genius for poetry
than a snail, nay, less than Mr. Ambrose Phil∣lips,
or Mr. Welsted; and though he would,
consequently, have wanted spirit enough for his
<PB N="252" REF="247"/>
father's tapster, yet his enemies confess him not
without merit. To do the man justice, he
might have made a tolerable figure as a taylor.
It were too presumptuous to affirm he could have
been a master in any profession; but, dull as I al∣low
him, he would not have been despicable for a
third, or fourth-hand journeyman. Then had
his wants been avoided; for he would, at least,
have learned ‘To cut his coat according to
his cloth.”</P>
<P>Why would not Mr. Theobald continue an
attorney? Is not word-catching more serviceable
in splitting a cause, than in explaining a fine
poet?</P>
<P>When Mrs. Haywood ceased to be a strolling
actress, why might not the lady (though once a
theatrical queen) have subsisted by turning
washer-woman? Has not the fall of greatness
been a frequent distress in all ages? She might
have caught a beautiful bubble as it arose from
the suds of her tub, blown it in air, seen it glit∣ter,
and then break! Even in this low condi∣tion,
she had played with a bubble, and what
more is the vanity of human greatness? She
might have also considered the sullied linen grow∣ing
white in her pretty red hands, as an emblem
<PB N="253" REF="248"/>
of her soul, were it well scoured by repentance
for the sins of her youth: but she rather chooses
starving by writing novels of intrigue, to teach
young heiresses the art of running away with
fortune-hunters, and scandalizing persons of the
highest worth and distinction.</P>
<P>When this lady, or these gentlemen are asked,
Why they abuse such and such persons? their
answer is, they are obliged to write for want of
money, and to abuse for want of other subjects.
Is want of money an excuse for picking a poc∣ket?
or what is worse, taking away a man's
good name? Is the poverty of Moore's genius
an excuse for filching Pope's lines? And appears
not the theft in his comedy as plain, as if a
cinder-wench should steal a gold watch, and
afterwards wear it? If this play was brought
forth, because his circumstances were reduced,
was he to retrieve them by committing poetical
felonies, and afterwards being the first to cry out
Thief? Deserves he not a whipping for such
petty-larceny? By a whipping be it known, I
only mean the poetical, wholesome <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash of satire.
A Danish colonel has lately condescended to be
a common centinel, and were Jemmy's heart as
firm as his countenance, had it not been more
<PB N="254" REF="249"/>
graceful in him to have carried a grenadier's cap,
a buff-coat, and a brown musquet? He is a pro∣per
figure, and of an exact size for his Prussian
majesty's service. Then had his comedy been
frittered into Oxford jests; each of his ac∣quaintance
had claimed their own, and he escap∣ed
the hisses and horse-laughs of the town, for
spoiling and misapplying them in a damned play.</P>
<P>Methinks Laurus had better been an univer∣sity
vintner, than a divine, or poet. Would not
bad wine have been easier put off than bad
poetry? Had not a bunch of grapes flourished
more naturally on his brow, than a sprig of
bays? Had he not with more propriety been
seen sitting astride a butt, with a bottle in one
hand, and a bumper in the other, roaring out a
merry catch, than mounting, after the first stave,
to thump a pulpit-cushion, and pause at every
half sentence with a hiccup?</P>
<P>If poverty in these lights is judged not a sub∣ject
for ridicule, I refer the reader to Iscariot
Hackney, and after his acquaintance with that
spark, I will only address myself in these few
words to the allies of Charing-cross. Say, gen∣tlemen,
has the Dunciad lashed your poverty?
A much severer satire on it you my find in your
own lives.</P>

<PB REF="250"/>
<HEAD>AN
AUTHOR
TO BE LET.</HEAD>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to find you meddle with the dirty work
of your brother journalists. To be inoffensive is a
puri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annical spirit, and will never succeed in a free∣thinking
age. What is gold itself (says the philo∣sopher)
but dirt? It is dug out of dirty mines; and,
as a proof it retains its nature, we come at it easiest
through dirty means. Be assured, a scavenger of
wit is a more gainful occupation than that of a de∣licate,
moral writer.</P>
<P>By this I mean to let you see my ability, and to
proffer my service. You must know when my mo∣ther
was pregnant of me, she once dreamed, she was
delivered of a monster. It was observed also, at the
time of my birth, that a weasel was heard to shriek;
and a bat (though at noon-day) flew into the room,
and settled upon the widwife's wrist, just as she re∣ceived
me. While in the cradle I was very froward.
Early at school I discovered a promising genius for
mischief. I carried tales from one boy to another to
set them a fighting, and afterwards to the master, to
<PB N="256" REF="251"/>
have them whipped. I had always cunning enough,
when I committed a fault, to lay the blame upon
another, and laugh'd to see him suffer for it: A
sure prognostick of my future judgment in politicks!
I was fond of tearing away the legs and wings of flies,
of picking out the eyes of some little bird, or laming
some favourite lap-dog, merely by way of amuse∣ment.
This was only a sign, that one time or other
I should have ill-nature enough for a great Wit. Now
I understand to be a great Wit, is to take a pleasure
in giving every body pain, and to shew no mercy to
a reputation, which is dearer to some fools than per∣haps
a limb or an eye. I was also given to pilfer
whatever lay in my way: a proof only that I wou'd
never scruple being a plagiary, shou'd I turn author.
I was expert at almost every thing except learning
my book; but neither encouragement nor correction
could bring me to any sense of duty. I was always
very sullen after being corrected; and if my master
forgave, and admonished me in a friendly manner,
I all the while ridiculed the old Put (as I then call'd
him) by making mouths or horns over his shoulder.
This shew'd I had always wit enough to laugh at the
common notion of gratitude. I hooted at any unfor∣tunate
ill-dress'd person in the street, if he look'd
like a gentleman, and never fail'd to mock the in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmities
of old age. When at a sermon, I was very
full of play myself, and fond of interrupting the de∣votion
<PB N="257" REF="252"/>
of others; so that (I thank my stars!) in my
youth I had a fashonable contempt for religion. I
came young into the world with little education, less
money, and no visible way of living: However, I
qualified myself (though of mean birth) for a gentle∣man
of wit and humour about town. I have natu∣rally
a sourness of temper, a droll solemnity of coun∣tenance,
and a dry manner of joking upon such ac∣cidents,
as fools who value themselves upon huma∣nity,
would be apt to compassionate. I have also a
propensity to sneer upon all mankind, and particu∣larly
upon those who fancy they can oblige me.
These elegant qualities recommended me early to
the friendship of Dick Morley, author of Mother
Wiseborn. We met frequently at a little snug gam∣ing-house,
never yet discovered by informing consta∣bles.
A similitude of circumstances and sympathy
of souls endeared us to each other; and to him I
owe the improvements of my afore-mentioned facul∣ties.
These he cultivated, and many others im∣planted
in me of the like nature.</P>
<P>We commenced authors together. At my first set∣ting
out I was hired by a reverend prebend to libel
Dean Swift for infidelity. Soon after I was employed
by Curl to write a merry tale, the wit of which was
its obscenity. This we agreed to palm upon the
world for a posthumous piece of Mr. Prior. How∣ever,
a certain lady, celebrated for certain liberties,
<PB N="258" REF="253"/>
had a curiosity to see the real author. Curl, on my
promise that if I had a present, he should go snacks,
sent me to her. I was admitted while her ladyship
was shifting; and on my admittance, Mrs. Abigail
was ordered to withdraw. What passed between us,
a point of gallantry obliges me to conceal; but after
some extraordinary civilities, I was dismissed with a
purse of guineas, and a command to write a sequel
to my tale. Upon this I turned out smart in dress,
bit Curl of his share, and run out most of my mo∣ney
in printing my works at my own cost. But some
years after (just at the time of his starving poor Pat∣tison)
the varlet was revenged. He arrested me for
several months board, brought me back to my gar∣ret,
and made me drudge on in my old dirty work.
'Twas in his service that I wrote Obscenity and Pro∣faneness,
under the names of Pope and Swift.
Sometimes I was Mr. Joseph Gay, and at others
theory Burnet, or Addison. I abridged histories and
travels, translated from the French what they never
wrote, and was expert at finding out new titles for
old books. When a notorious thief was hanged, I
was the Plutarch to preserve his memory; and when
a great man died, mine were his Remains, and mine
the account of his last will and testament. Had Mr.
Oldmixon and Mr. Curl agreed, my assistance had
probably been invited into father Bohour's logick,
and the critical history of England.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="254"/>
But before all this happened, a young nobleman
gratified me for letting some verses of mine be handed
about at court in manuscript under his name. This
was the first time that I ever heard my writings ge∣nerally
commended. But alas! how short-lived the
applause! They unfortunately stole into print, lost
their reputation at once, and I am now ashamed to
write any more, as a person of quality. I am a
great joker, and deal in clinches, puns, quibbles,
gibes, conundrums, and carry-which-its. Many a
good time have I lashed the whole body of clergy,
and cracked many a smart joke upon the Trinity.
One of my books had the honour of being presented
for a libel by the grand-jury, and another was
made a burnt-offering by the hands of the common
hangman. If an author writes a piece that has suc∣cess
in his own character, I abuse him; but if in a
fictitious one, I endeavour to personate him, and
write a second part to his work. I am very deeply
read in all pieces of scandal, obscenity, and profane∣ness,
particularly in the writings of Mrs. Haywood,
Henley, Welsted, Morley, Foxton, Cooke, De Foe,
Norton, Woolston, Dennis, Ned Ward, Concanen,
Journalist Pitt, and the author of the Rival Modes.
From these I propose to compile a very grand work,
which shall not be inferior to Utopia, Carimania,
Gulliverania, Art of Flogging, Daily Journal, Epi∣grams
on the Dunciad, or Oratory Transactions;
<PB N="260" REF="255"/>
and, as this is designed for the use of young temp∣lers,
it is hoped they will promote my subscription.
Since private vices have been proved to be publick
benefits, I would venture to call it An useful Body
of Immorality, and print it in a broad, pompous
folio; but such a one as may very well be bound up
with Dean Smedley's intended Body of Divinity.</P>
<P>By the help of indexes, and technical dictionaries,
I work on every branch of learning. I pore often
over the volumes of State Tracts, whence I collect
paragraphs, which I mix with remarks of my own,
and range under several heads. Those against a dis∣carded
minister I send to the London Journal, or
Concanen's Daily, or Weekly Papers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>In thy felonious heart, tho' malice lies,</L>
<L>It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.</L>
<L>DRYDEN.</L>
</LG></NOTE> Concanen
is a precious fellow! I once loved him for his ingra∣titude
to Dean Swift: I now adore him for his dull
humour, and malevolent blundering Billingsgate
against my lord Bolingbroke. Other paragraphs more
virulent against a prime minister (for I naturally hate
my superiors) are for my very good friend the Crafts∣man.
How long have I called up the shades of Se∣janus,
Buckingham, and Wolsey, to compare them
to one who mortifies me by laughing at the compa∣rison?
How long shall I still press on one, whom I
continually call state-plunderer, and wicked minister?
<PB N="261" REF="256"/>
Perhaps till the world will maliciously liken me to a
tailor's goose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A comparison of Dr. SOUTH'S.</NOTE>, which is at once hot and heavy.
Rather than stand out of the play, I have penned pa∣negyricks
in Mist or Fog on Rich's pantomimes, and
Theobald's Sheakspear restored. I am always listed
by Mr. Lun the Harlequin, to hiss the first night at
any of the Drury-lane performances. Sometimes I
draw up challenges for the champions of Mr. Figg's
amphitheatre, and sometimes for the disputants of
Mr. Henley's oratory.</P>
<P>I have an excellent knack at birth-day odes, elo∣gies,
acrosticks, anagrams, epithalamiums, prologues,
recommendatory poems, rhimes for almanack-mak∣ers,
and witty distichs for the signs of country-inns
and ale-houses. When with an audible voice I spout
forth my own verses, marvellous is their effect! The
very bell-man has been touched with envy—an au∣thor,
who like Mr. Ralph<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Author of a poem called NIGHT.</NOTE>, has distinguished him∣self
by Night; the shrillness of my clamorous dun∣ning
landlady has been charm'd into a still attention!
Nay, the very bailiff, in act to rush upon me, has
stopped short to listen, and for a minute suspended
the rapacious palm that was to fall upon my shoul∣ders!</P>
<P>I have well perused the writings of Luke Milbourn,
Shadwell, Settle, Blackmore, and many others of our
<PB N="262" REF="257"/>
stamp, notable for falt wit upon Dryden. From these
I have extracted curious hints to assist Welsted in his
new satire against Pope, which was once (he told me)
to have been christened Labeo. 'Tis yet an embrio,
and there are divers opinions about the birth of it.
Some expect it will spring from his wise noddle, like
Minerva from the head of Jupiter, and work won∣ders.
Others, that it will resemble Milton's figure
of Sin coming from the brain of the father of lies.
Then, say they, it will damn its parent's reputation.
But most are of opinion, that my brother has no re∣putation
to lose, and therefore the brat will be still-born.
'Tis possible also he may miscarry of his se∣cond
epistle to Mr. Pope, though James Moore
Smythe Esquire is to officiate man-midwife.</P>
<P>When a man of quality is distinguished for a wit,
or an encourager of it, I endeavour to strike him for
a dedication; but I have generally been so unhappy
as to disgust my patrons, by praising them in the
wrong place. For want of being acquainted with
polite life, I have unwittingly complimented a person
for an illustrious birth, who really owed his rise en∣tirely
to his merit. Thus have I caused his enemies
to sneer, and, perhaps, to libel him for my squab
complement; when, had I left him to his choice, he
had rather chose my satire than my panegyrick.</P>
<P>I am as famous as one of the suitors in Homer's
Odyssey, for dead-born jests. Many a sonnet of mine,
<PB N="263" REF="258"/>
and several Bouts Rimez that were filled up by me,
has Moore read, with his usual modesty, at White's
and the drawing-room, for his own; but as they were
mere slips of my pen, and could be of no advantage
to my reputation (low as it stands) I am contented
to humour his vanity, and forbear to claim them. I
assisted in a pretty play of words on the letter P. and
the advertisement of the Lady's writing-desk. Soon
after I chopped sides, and wrote the history of the
Norfolk Dumpling, the verses on the Norfolk Lan∣thern,
Robin's Reign, Robin's Game, the Fall of
Mortimer, and many other popular libels on persons
who least deserved them; but the reason of that was,
because they were of the ministry.</P>
<P>Now is the session of parliament, and the poetical
quarrels must give way to the political. Consequently
the affairs of state (as Abel in the play of the Com∣mittee
observes) “will lie heavy upon my neck and
shoulders.” It is a custom among great generals to
send spies into an enemy's camp, and among politi∣cians,
to employ 'em in foreign courts. I have there∣fore
(as I am determined to oppose the ministry)
settled a secret correspondence with several gentle∣men
of the party-coloured cloth; men of dignity!
such as have no less an honour than that of holding
a plate in the presence of some certain knights of
the blue ribbon. My bribe is a pot of ale, and my
intelligence the scraps of conversation that fall at the
<PB N="264" REF="259"/>
table of great ministers. By these I am enabled to
discuss the matters in debate at the house of com∣mons,
and the congress of Soissons, to state the debts
of the nation, to arraign the conduct of those at the
helm, and to hold the balance of Europe, with as
much ease as a monkey does a chesnut, in my own
paw.</P>
<P>The time has been when, after an evening's hard
boosing, my brother bards (who have been what we
call seedy, or crop-sick) have bilked the publick
house, and barbarously left me in pawn for the reck∣oning.
On this emergency I have written an account
of a sharp and bloody fight, a vision in the air, or a
wonderful prophecy, to be hawked about streets: And
(would you believe it?) even these productions of mine
have passed for designed wit, and I have silently
sneered to find the merit of them claimed and boasted
of by Jemmy Moore.</P>
<P>I have sometimes taken it in my head, that I might
make a fortune by writing for the stage. As a proof
that I have an excellent taste, I always despised the
tragedies of Shakespear, Otway, Young and Thom∣son,
and preferred with admiration a certain person's
operas at the Hay-market. I wonder that the success
of the latter should be applied to Mr. Handell's mu∣sick,
or the performances of Senesino, Faustina, and
Cutzoni: The town in this have been shamefully
blind to the merit of that gentleman. He has fol∣lowed
<PB N="265" REF="260"/>
the ancients so closely in the propriety of his
conduct, the unity of his characters, the natural, va∣riety
of passions, the strength of sentiment, and the
elegance of diction, that I here invite him to join
with me in an English tragedy on an opera plan.</P>
<P>If the gentleman thinks this too arduous an under∣taking,
let us venture at a lower cast! without any
recourse to wit, humour, natural dialogue, songs
aptly introduced, or any other of those trifles with
which the Beggar's Opera abounds, we have one sure
comfort; that is, we cannot fall short of many late
performances of that kind, nor be excelled by Roome
and his led captain Concanen. Roome cannot excel
me, unless he excels himself.</P>
<P>I have tried all means (but that fools call honest
ones) for a livelihood. I offered my service for a se∣cret
spy to the state; but had not credit enough even
for that. When it was indeed very low with me, I
printed proposals for a subscription to my works, re∣ceived
money, and gave receipts, without any inten∣tion
of delivering the book. Though I have been no∣toriously
profane, and was never at an university,
I once aimed to be admitted into orders; but being
obliged to abscond lately from the parish-officers, on
account of a bastard child, and falling besides into
an unlucky salivation, my character was so scanda∣lous,
that I could not prevail even on the lowest of
the Fleet-prison parsons to sign my testimonials.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="261"/>
My last attempt was to have been a travelling tutor
to some young gentleman. If I am deficient in clas∣sick
learning, I could yet have instructed him in the
laws of his own country; for tho' I never studied
Coke upon Littleton, yet I have conversed with bai∣liffs
and petty-fogging attornies; nay, I have conned
over the abridgments of Giles Jacob; I could also
have read him lectures of politicks from essays of my
own in Weekly Journals. What though I wanted
knowledge to make dissertations upon the languages,
manners, histories, statues, coins, paintings, archi∣tecture,
or any other curiosities, ancient or modern,
of foreign climes; what though I could not have
traced out any one country in a map; could I not
have pillaged voyage-writers, and have taken the
reports of inn-keepers or postilions, to have told
where there were good wine, good beds, buxom girls,
and tall steeples? Few foreign tutors understand the
dead languages; but if they play at cards, dance,
talk of things they never saw, or, having, seen, could
not understand; if they put on the swaggering air of
half-pay captains, and swear French military oaths
with a bon grace, will they not pass for men of wit,
experience and knowledge? I should have made a
very fashionable tutor, I would have spirited up my
pupil to run away with a nun; and, if he aimed at
smaller game, not scrupled being pimp. I have stu∣died
physick under the Anodyne Necklace doctor, and
<PB N="267" REF="262"/>
would have prepared and exported a whole cargo
of antivenereal pills for his safety. No one, I
am persuaded, will blame me, if I took this op∣portunity
of feathering my own nest. I should, per∣haps,
have made him pay ten per cent. for his
own money when I disbursed it, and a guinea on
many occasions for his honour; twenty shillings of
which I might have put into my own pocket. Who
knows, but I might have married some rich widow,
by securing my pupil for one of her daughters?
I would have contrived he should have stolen the
young lady to avoid paying her fortune. If this
scheme failed, I had another, for which I am
afraid I might have been a little censured; it was
only to have set him at a gaming table (when abroad)
for about a thousand pounds, and afterwards gone
snacks with the sharpers. But on second thoughts,
where had been the hurt? When returned, and
at age, I could easily have made him amends, by
negotiating a mortgage, or the sale of a reversion
for him with honest Ch. rt. r. s.</P>
<P>Thus, though I had but a hundred a year, and
for no more than two or three years service, I could
retire to Swisserland, or Wales, with about fifteen
hundred pounds in my pocket, and an annuity of
fifty pounds per annum for life. In such a retire∣ment
I should have set down to writing an Account
of my Travels. When those were finished, by care∣fully
<PB N="268" REF="263"/>
extracting from Gazettes, I should have been
able to have left my executors the memoirs of my
own times; then would I have indulged my spleen
against the present ministers, for neglecting to gra∣tify
my merit. It is dangerous to anger a poet or
historian.</P>
<P>I observed, at the head of this letter, that I have
a drollery in my countenance: egad! it is as pecu∣liar
a one as Roome's. We are so like, that before
he scribbled himself into preferment, we have ac∣tually
been mistaken for each other. Our looks
are so happy, as to have passed off many a saying
in conversation for wit and humour, that, when
published, has been thought flat: nay, the same
thing has been said of me, as was uttered by a cer∣tain
wit (one very different from our rank) on him,
viz. That “the r. g..’s misfortune is, he cannot
print his face to his joke.”</P>
<P>While I am thus delineating my features, permit
me to own, that I wish my portrait might shine in a
mezzotento through the glass-windows of picture-shops
in Fleet-street and St. Paul's Church-yard;
then should I be gazed on with admiration by mer∣cers
'prentices! But I will, at least, indulge my
vanity in appearing on a large sheet of paper, in a
wooden cut, which ingenious school-boys may de∣light
to colour with yellow and red ochre. What a
glaring figure shall I then make in the long piazza
<PB N="269" REF="264"/>
of Covent Garden! I shall be surrounded by voner∣able
old ballads; and several of my family-pieces,
such as the Sinners Coat of Arms, and the dreadful
sketches of Death, Judgment, and Damnation!
Thence shall I be translated to the naked walls of
country ale-houses, cobblers-stalls, and necessary-houses!
—And thou, O R. M., thou who art my
other self! be this my glory! however different our
fortunes, however unlike the incidents of our lives;
yet, whensoever the countenance of Iscariot Hackney
is seen, thy own dear phiz will be called to remem∣brance.</P>
<P>In short, I am a perfect town author: I hate all
mankind, yet am occasionally a mighty patriot. I
am very poor, and owe my poverty to my merit;
that is, to my writings: I am as proud as I am
poor; yet, what is, seemingly a contradiction, never
stick at a mean action, when the welfare of the re∣public
of letters, or, in other words, my own inte∣rest
is concerned. My pen, like the sword of a
Swiss, or the pleading of a lawyer, is generally
employed for pay. There is one piece of advice,
gentlemen, which I would propose to you: if any
papers of a dead wit should fall into the hands of
a member of your society, let him be sure to print
them, though never so derogatory to the person's
reputation, to get himself money; and if, among
whole heaps of indigested papers, he finds a few
<PB N="270" REF="265"/>
with large corrections and additions by another emi∣nent
hand (which he well knows), let him be sure
to suppress that circumstance in his publication.</P>
<P>But to return to myself—My pamphlets sell many
more impressions than those of celebrated writers;
the secret of this is, I learned from Curl to clap a
new title-page to the sale of every half hundred;
so that when my bookseller has sold two hundred
and fifty copies, my book generally enters into the
sixth edition. It is reckoned a villainous action to
write a libel, but more so to father one on a person
who neither wrote it, nor approves it; now, I own
I never scruple to do both. When a man of figure,
(perhaps an ornament of his country) has been
cruelly aspersed in his life-time, I love to revive the
aspersion at his death: it is mirth to me to grieve a
whole family, by insulting his memory before his
body is cold in the grave. In this I imitate the
authority of “Sarah the Quaker in the Shades, to
Lothario lately deceased.” Though I am so ready
to libel others, I am downright frightened if I but
hear of a satire where my name is likely to be in∣serted.
When a person does me a favour, I either
suspect he has some design on me, or think it less
than my due, and that he is obliged to me, because
an author, for accepting it. I am very testy, if I
am not allowed dictator of my company; nor had I
ever a friend, whom I did not his absence sacrifice
<PB N="271" REF="266"/>
to my jest. I contemn the few who admire me, am
angry with the multitude who despise me, and
mortally hate all who have any ways obliged me.
I assure you, I am very famous for several Trea∣tises
in defence of Ingratitude: I never fail to il∣lustrate
them with the examples of Marcus Bru∣tus
among the ancients, and very eminent statesmen
among the moderns. My private resentment, like
that of other great men, is always a public justice.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, if you like me for a corres∣pondent,
my price is the price of a Journalist, a
crown; and, in the style of a love-bargain, half-wet,
half-dry. You may find me in a morning at
my lucubrations, over a quartern-pot in a Geneva-shop
in Clare-Market; a house, where I propose
many learned interviews with orator Henley, who
has removed his stage to that place. I generally
dine with a brother bard, at one of the little cook's-shops
near St. Martin's-Church, and probably spend
the evening with him at a night-cellar in the Strand,
where I shall be ready to enter into a treaty with,
you.</P>
