<HEAD>LESSONS
FOR CHILDREN,
OF THREE YEARS OLD.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD morrow, little
boy! how do you do?
Bring your little stool, and
sit down by me, for I have
a great deal to tell you.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>I hope you have been a good
boy, and read all the pretty
words I wrote for you before.
You have, you say; You
have read them till you are
tired, and you want some
more new lessons. Come
then, sit down. Now you
and I will tell stories.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<P>What is to day, Charles?</P>
<P>To day is Sunday.</P>
<P>And what is to morrow?</P>
<P>To morrow will be Mon∣day.</P>
<P>And what will the next
day be?</P>
<P>The next day will be Tues∣day.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<P>And the next day?</P>
<P>Wednesday.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Thursday.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Friday.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Saturday.</P>
<P>And what will come after
Saturday?</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<P>Why then, Sunday will
come again.</P>
<P>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Fri∣day,
Saturday. That makes
seven days, and seven days
make</P>
<P>A week.</P>
<P>And do you know how
much four weeks make?</P>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<P>How much?</P>
<P>A month. And twelve
months make a year—Janua∣ry,
February, March, April,
May, June, July, August,
September, October, Novem∣ber,
December.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<P>It is January. It is very
cold. It snows. It freezes.
There are no leaves upon the
trees. The oil is frozen, and
the milk is frozen, and the
river is frozen, and every
thing.</P>
<P>All the boys are sliding.
You must learn to slide. There
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
is a man skaiting. How fast
he goes! You shall have a
pair of skates. Take care!
there is a hole in the ice.
Come in. It is four o'clock.
It is dark. Light the can∣dles;
and Ralph! get some
wood from the wood-house,
and get some coals, and make
a very good fire.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<P>February is very cold too,
but the days are longer, and
there is a yellow crocus com∣ing
up, and the mezereon
tree is in blossom, and there
are some white snow-drops
peeping up their little heads.
Pretty white snow-drop, with
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
a green stalk! May I ga∣ther
it? Yes, you may,
but you must always ask leave
before you gather a flower.
What a noise the rooks make!
Caw, caw, caw; and how
busy they are! They are
going to build their nests.
There is a man ploughing the
field.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
<P>It is March. Now the
wind blows! It will blow
such a little fellow as you
away, almost. There is a
tree blown down.</P>
<P>Here are some young lambs.
Poor things! how they creep
under the hedge. What is
this flower? A primrose.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
<P>April is come, and the
birds sing, and the trees are
in blossom, and flowers are
coming out, and butterflies,
and the sun shines. Now
it rains. It rains and the
sun shines. There is a rain-bow.
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
O what fine colours!
Pretty bright rain-bow! No,
you cannot catch it, it is in
the sky. It is going away.
It fades. it is quite gone.
I hear the cuckow. He says,
cuckow! cuckow! He is
come to tell us it is spring.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
<P>It is May. O pleasant
May! Let us walk out in
the fields. The hawthorn
is in blossom. Let us go and
get some out of the hedges.
And here are daisies, and
cowslips, and crow-flowers.
We will make a nosegay.
Here is a bit of thread to tie
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
it with. Smell! It is very
sweet. What has Billy got?
He has got a nest of young
birds. He has been climb∣ing
a high tree for them.
Poor little birds! they have
no feathers. Keep them
warm. You must feed them
with a quill. You must give
them bread and milk. They
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
are young goldfinches. They
will be very pretty, when
they have got their red head
and yellow wings. Do not
let them die. The little
birds, papa and mamma will
be very sorry if they come
to die. O do not eat green
goose-berries! they will make
you ill.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
<P>June is come. Get up!
you must not lie so long in
bed now; you must get up,
and walk before breakfast.
What noise is that? It is
the mower sharpening his
scythe. He is going to cut
down the grass. And will
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
he cut down all the flowers
too? Yes, every thing. The
scythe is very sharp. Do
not come near it; you will
have your legs cut off. Now
we must make hay. Where
is your fork, and rake?
Spread the hay. Now make
it up in cocks. Now tum∣ble
on the hay cock. There!
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
cover him up with hay.
How sweet the hay smells!
O, it is very hot! No mat∣ter;
you must make hay
while the sun shines. You
must work well. See, all
the lads and lasses are at work.
They must have some beer,
and bread, and cheese. Now
put the hay in the cart. Will
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
you ride in the cart? Huz∣za!
Hay is for papa's horse
to eat in winter, when there
is no grass.</P>
<P>Do you love strawberries
and cream? Let us go then,
and gather some strawberries.
They are ripe now. Here
is a very large one. It is
almost too big to go into
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
your mouth. Get me a
bunch of currants. Strip
them from the stalk. The
birds have pecked all the
cherries. Where is Charles?
He is sitting under a rose-bush.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
<P>July is very hot indeed,
and the grass and flowers are
all burnt, for it has not rain∣ed
a great while. You must
water your garden, else the
plants will die. Where is
the watering-pot? Let us
go under the trees. It is
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
shady there, it is not so hot.
Come into the arbour. There
is a bee upon the honeysuc∣kle.
He is getting honey.
He will carry it to the hive.
Will you go and bathe in
the water? Here is water.
It is not deep. Pull off your
cloaths. Jump in. Do not
be afraid. Pop your head in.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
<P>Now you have been
long enough. Come out, and
let me dry you with this
towel.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
<P>It is August. Let us go
into the corn fields to see if
the corn is almost ripe. Yes,
it is quite brown: it is ripe.
Farmer Diggory! you must
bring a sharp sickle and cut
down the corn; it is ripe.
Eat some, Charles; rub it
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
in your hands. This is a
grain of corn; this is an ear
of corn; this stalk makes
straw. Now it must be tied
up in sheaves. Now put a
great many sheaves together,
and make a shock. Put it
in the cart, farmer Diggory!
carry it to your barn to make
bread. Sing harvest home!
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
harvest home! There is a
poor old woman, picking up
some ears of corn; and a
poor little girl that has no
cloaths, hardly. They are
gleaning. Give them your
handful, Charles. Take it,
poor woman! it will help to
make you a loaf. Poor wo∣man!
she is very old, she
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
cannot run; she is sadly tired
with stooping.</P>
<P>It is Sptember. Hark!
somebody is letting off a gun.
They are shooting the poor
birds. Here is a bird dropped
down just at your feet. It is
all bloody. Poor thing! how
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
it flutters. Its wing is broke.
It cannot fly any further. It
is going to die. What bird is
it? It is a partridge. Are
you not sorry, Charles? it
was alive a little while ago.</P>
<P>Bring the ladder, and set
it against the tree. Now
bring a basket. We must
gather apples. No, you
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
cannot go up the ladder;
you must have a little basket,
and pick up apples under the
tree. Shake the tree. Down
they come. How many have
you got? We will have an
apple dumpling. Come, you
must help to carry the apples
into the apple chamber. Ap∣ples
make cyder. You shall
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
have some baked pears and
bread for supper. Are these
apples? No, they are quin∣ces,
they will make mar∣malade.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
<P>October is come, Charles;
and the leaves are falling off
the trees; and the flowers
are all gone. No, here is an
African marygold, and a
China-after, and a Michael∣mas
daisy. Will you have
any nuts? Fetch the nut-crackers.
Peel this walnut.
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
I will make you a little boat
of the walnut-shell. We must
get the grapes, or else the
birds will eat them all. Here
is a bunch of black grapes.
Here is a bunch of white
ones. Which will you have?
Grapes make wine.</P>
<P>What bird have you got
there? It is dead, but it is
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
very pretty. It has a scarlet
eye, and red, and green
and purple feathers. It is
very large. It is a pheasant.
He is very good to eat. We
will pull off his feathers and
tell Betty Cook to roast him.
Here is a hare too. Poor
puss! The hounds did catch
her.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
<P>Dark dismal November is
come. No more flowers!
no more hay-making! The
sky is very black; the rain
pours down. Well, never
mind it. We will sit by the
fire, and read, and tell
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
stories, and look at pictures.
Where is Billy, and Harry,
and little Betsy? Now tell
me who can spell best. Good
boy! There is a clever
fellow! Now you shall all
have some cake.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
<P>It is December, and
Christmas is coming, and
Betty is very busy. What
is she doing? She is paring
apples, and chopping meat,
and beating spice. What
for, I wonder! It is to
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
make mince-pies. Do you
love mince-pies? O they
are very good! Little boys
come from school at Christ∣mas.
Pray wrap them up
warm, for it is very cold.
Well, Spring will come a∣gain
sometime.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
<P>How many fingers have
you got, little boy?</P>
<P>Here are four fingers on
this hand; and what is this?
Thumb. Four fingers and
thumb, that makes five.
And how many on the other
hand?</P>
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>
<P>There are five too.</P>
<P>What hand is this?</P>
<P>This is the right hand.</P>
<P>And this? This is the
left hand.</P>
<P>And how many toes have
you got? Let us count.</P>
<P>Five upon this foot, and
five upon this foot.</P>
<P>Five and five makes ten:
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
ten fingers and ten toes.</P>
<P>How many legs have you?</P>
<P>Here is one, and here is a∣nother.
Charles has two legs.</P>
<P>How many legs has a horse?</P>
<P>A horse has four legs.</P>
<P>And how many has a dog?</P>
<P>Four: and a cow has
four; and a sheep has four;
and puss has four legs.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
<P>And how many legs have
the chickens?</P>
<P>Go and look.</P>
<P>The chickens have only
two legs.</P>
<P>And the linnets, and the
robins, and all the birds,
have only two legs.</P>
<P>But I will tell you what
birds have got; they have
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
got wings to fly with, and
they fly very high in the air.</P>
<P>Charles has no wings.</P>
<P>No, because Charles is not
a bird.</P>
<P>Charles has got hands.
Cows have no hands, and
birds have no hands.</P>
<P>Have birds teeth? No,
they have no teeth.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
<P>How do they eat their
victuals then?</P>
<P>Birds have got a bill. Look
at the chickens, they pick
up the corn in their little
bills. See how fast they
pick it up.</P>
<P>Charles's mouth is soft;
the chicken's bill is hard
like bone.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
<P>How many legs have
fishes?</P>
<P>Fishes have no legs at all.
How do they walk then?
They do not walk; they
swim about in the water;
they live always in the water.</P>
<P>Charles could not live un∣der
the water.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>
<P>No, because Charles is not
a fish.</P>
<P>Here is a fish that some∣body
has caught. Poor little
fish! throw it on the grass.
See how it flounces about!
It has a hook in its gills.
Take it by the tail. it is
slippery, you cannot hold it.
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
See, these are fins. It has
got fins to swim with; and
it has got scales, and sharp
teeth. It will be dead soon.
It is going to die. It can∣not
stir any more. Now it
is quite dead. The fish dies
because it is out of the water,
and Charles would die if he
was in the water.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
<P>What has Charles got to
keep him warm?</P>
<P>Charles has got a frock
and warm petticoats.</P>
<P>And what have the poor
sheep got; have they petti∣coats?</P>
<P>The sheep have got wool,
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
thick warm wool. Feel it.
O, it is very comfortable!
That is their petticoat.</P>
<P>And what have horses got?</P>
<P>Horses have got long hair;
and cows have hair.</P>
<P>And what have birds got?</P>
<P>Birds have got feathers;
soft, clean, shining feathers.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
<P>Birds build nests in trees;
that is their house.</P>
<P>The wolf has a den; that
is his house.</P>
<P>The dog has a kennel.</P>
<P>The bees live in a hive.</P>
<P>The pigs live in a stye.</P>
<P>Can you climb a tree?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>But you must learn then.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
<P>As soon as you have breeches
you must learn to climb
trees.</P>
<P>Ask puss to teach you; she
can climb. See, how fast
she climbs! She is at the
top. She wants to catch
birds. Pray puss do not take
the little birds that sing so
merrily! She has got a
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
sparrow in her mouth. She
has eat it all up. No, here
are two or three feathers on
the ground all bloody. Poor
sparrow.</P>
<P>The dog barks. The hog
grunts. The pig squeaks.
The horse neighs. The cock
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
crows. The ass brays. The cat
purrs. The kitten mews. The
bull bellows. The cow lows.
The calf bleats. Sheep bleat.
The lion roars. The wolf
howls. The tyger growls.
The fox barks. Mice squeak.
The Frog croaks. The spar∣row
chirps. The swallow
twitters. The rook caws.
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>
The bittern booms. The pi∣geon
coos. The turkey gob∣bles.
The peacock screams.
The beetle hums. The
grasshopper chirps. The
duck quacks. The goose
cackles. Monkeys chatter.
The owl hoots. The screech-owl
shrieks. The snake
hisses. Charles talks.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
<P>Kites and hawks eat chick∣ens.</P>
<P>Spiders make cobwebs;
they catch flies in them and
eat them up.</P>
<P>Owls fly in the night.</P>
<P>Butchers kill sheep.</P>
<P>The carpenter makes ta∣bles
and boxes.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
<P>You shall have a box, with
a lock and a key to it.</P>
<P>The carpenter has a saw,
and a chisel, and a plane,
and an adze, and a gimblet,
and a turn-screw, and a hatch∣et,
and a file, and a vice,
and pincers, and a hammer,
and nails, and a mallet.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
<P>Charles's wooden horse is
broke.</P>
<P>Well, take it to the car∣penter's;
let him mend it.</P>
<P>Charles has fallen down
and broke his head.</P>
<P>Shall I take it to the car∣penter's.</P>
<P>No, silly boy! Carpenters
do not mend heads.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="60"/>
<P>Shoe-makers make shoes.</P>
<P>Old people wear specta∣cles.</P>
<P>Good boys love to read.</P>
<P>The barber shaves.</P>
<P>Come papa! sit down;
you must have your beard
shaved.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>
<P>Here is the soap, and the
bason, and the razor.</P>
<P>Barber, do not cut papa.</P>
<P>Shall we go into the garden,
and see the flowers, and the
apple trees, and run about in
the gravel walk?</P>
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
<P>Where is your roller?
Come roll the walk.</P>
<P>Work well, and perhaps
I may give you a halfpenny
a day. Every body works,
but little babies; they cannot
work.</P>
<P>If you are a good boy, you
shall have a little garden of
your own, and a spade to
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
dig with, and a hoe, and a
rake, and a little wheelbar∣row;
and pray do not let
me see any weeds in your
garden; pull them all up.
And you must make a little
hedge about it, else the pigs
will get in and spoil it. And
you must go to the gardener,
and say, pray give me some
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
seeds; and you must sow
them. You must make a
little hole in the ground, and
put them in, and cover them
up with mould, and they
will grow. Here is some
cress and mustard seed. Sow
it, and we will have a sallad.
Water your garden. Charles,
look at this gooseberry bush;
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
it was but so high when we
put it in the ground, and now
it is a great deal taller; it is
so high.</P>
<P>The gooseberry bush grows.</P>
<P>Does Charles grow?</P>
<P>Yes; Charles could not
reach the table once, and
now he can reach higher a
great deal.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
<P>Is the table taller than it
was a great while ago?</P>
<P>No; the table does not
grow.</P>
<P>Why does not the table
grow, Charles?</P>
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
<P>Here is a lady-bird upon
a leaf. It is red and has
black spots. Ah! it has
wings. It is flown away.
There is a black beetle.
Catch it. How fast it runs!
Where is it gone? Into the
ground. It makes a little
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>
hole and runs into the
ground. Worms live in the
ground.</P>
<P>It is cold, Charles, very
cold! Pray what do they
call it when it is so cold?
They call it winter, you
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
know. I wonder what poor
little boys do, that have no
fire to go to, and no shoes
and stockings to keep them
warm, and no good papas
and mammas to take care
of them and give them vic∣tuals.
Poor little boys!
Do not cry, Charles, for
here is a halfpenny, and when
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
you see one of those poor
little boys you shall give it
him: he will go and buy a
roll with it, for he is very
hungry; and he will say,
Thank you Charles, you are
very good to me!</P>
<P>I will tell you what,
Charles; it will be a great
deal colder soon, and snow
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
will come down. Then the
pretty little robins will
come and fly against the
windows. Open the win∣dow.
Well, what do you
want, little robin? Only a
few crumbs of bread. Give
him some crumbs and he
will hop, hop, about the
parlour, and sit upon the
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
top of the screen, and sing;
O he will sing all day long!
Now pray do not let that
wicked cat take him. No,
puss! you must go and catch
mice, you shall not eat poor
robin. There was a cruel
naughty boy once—I will
tell you a story about him.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="73"/>
<P>There was a naughty boy;
I do not know what his
name was, but it was not
Charles, nor George, nor
Arthur, for those are all ve∣ry
pretty names: but there
was a robin came in at his
window one very cold morn∣ing
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
—shiver—shiver, and its
poor little heart was almost
frozen to death. And he
would not give it the least
little crumb of bread in the
world, but pulled it about by
the tail, and hurt it sadly, and
it died. Now a little while
after the naughty boy's papa
and mamma went away and
<PB N="75" REF="75"/>
left him; and then he could
get no victuals at all, for you
know he could not take
care of himself. So he went
about to every body—Pray
give me something to eat,
I am very hungry. And
every body said, No, we
shall give you none, for we
do not love cruel naughty
<PB N="76" REF="76"/>
boys. So he went about from
one place to another, till
at last he got into a thick
wood of trees, for he did
not know how to find his
way any where; and then it
grew dark, quite dark night.
So he sat down and cried
sadly; and he could not get
out of the wood; and I believe
<PB N="77" REF="77"/>
the bears came and eat him
up in the wood, for I never
heard any thing about him
afterwards.</P>
<P>I will tell you another
story.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="78"/>
<P>There was a little boy;
he was not a big boy, for if
he had been a big boy I sup∣pose
he would have been
wiser; but this was a little
boy, not higher than the
table, and his papa and
mamma sent him to school:
It was a very pleasant morning;
<PB N="79" REF="79"/>
the sun shone, and the birds
sung in the trees. Now this
little boy did not much love
his book, for he was but
a silly little boy as I told
you; and he had a great
mind to play instead of going
to school. And he saw a
bee flying about, first upon
one flower and then upon
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>
another; so he said, Pretty
bee! will you come and play
with me? But the bee said,
No, I must not be idle, I
must go and gather honey.
Then the little boy met a
dog, and he said, Dog! will
you play with me? But
the dog said, No, I must not
be idle, I am going to catch
<PB N="81" REF="81"/>
a hare for my master's dinner,
I must make haste and catch
it. Then the little boy went
by a hay-rick, and he saw
a bird pulling some hay out
of the hay-rick, and he said
Bird! will you come and
play with me? But the bird
said, No, I must not be idle,
I must get some hay to build
<PB N="82" REF="82"/>
my nest with, and some
moss, and some wool. So
the bird flew away. Then
the little boy saw a horse,
and he said, Horse! will you
play with me? But the
horse said, No, I must not
be idle, I must go and plough,
or else there will be no corn
to make bread of. Then the
<PB N="83" REF="83"/>
little boy thought with him∣self,
what, is no body idle?
then little boys must not be
idle neither. So he made
haste, and went to school,
and learned his lesson very
well, and the master said he
was a very good boy.</P>
