THE MAID OF BATH, A COMEDY, OF THREE ACTS, As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL, in the Hay-Market.</P>
<P>By SAMUEL FOOTE, Esq.</P>
<P>WITH THE ORIGINAL PROLOGUE, As written By Mr. GARRICK, And spoken By Mr. FOOTE; The EPILOGUE, spoken by Mrs. JEWELL.</P>

<HEAD>TO SAMUEL FOOTE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very ungentleman-like treatment you have experienced from the avariciousness and personal envy of the managers of both hou∣ses, in mutilating your plays and changing them into farces, determined you, long since, to sup∣press the publication of any future production. With an eye of pity you beheld the sordid views and ungenerous dispositions of Mr. C. and Mr. G. A species of dramatic writing they never could attain to, prompted them to injure you in in the nicest and most sensible manner, that of profitting by the labour and invention of a Gen∣tleman, whose abilities, as actor and performer, could support the expences of a theatre at a time, when with all their ingenuity and pageantry, they
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
are under absolute necessity of shutting up their houses.</P>
<P>FROM these motives, the Public had to regret the loss of those pieces which do the greatest honor to your literary merit.</P>
<P>ONE objection, only, was raised to this pub∣lication of the MAID OF BATH, <HI>viz.</HI> That whilst the Publisher rail'd at the avariciousness of others, he might be condemn'd for covetousness and un∣generous treatment himself.</P>
<P>BUT the case is materially different. As you never intended to benefit yourself by a publica∣tion, no injury can be done you by its being published by another hand. In short, Sir, could the least injury accrue, no one would be more ready to forego every advantage; but whilst the contrary is manifestly the case, you and the world will excuse me for giving them the perusal of a piece which they have long lamented as buried in oblivion; especially those who never could have an opportunity of seeing the performance.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by D. GARRICK, Esq. And spoken by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<L>WHO but has read, if he can read at all,</L>
<L>Of one, they <HI>Jack the Giant-killer</HI> call:</L>
<L>He was a bold, stout, able-bodied man,</L>
<L>To clear the world of <HI>fee, faw, fum,</HI> his plan.</L>
<L>Whene'er a <HI>monster</HI> had within his power</L>
<L>A young and tender <HI>virgin</HI> to devour,</L>
<L>To cool his blood, <HI>Jack,</HI> like a skilful surgeon,</L>
<L>Bled well the <HI>monster</HI> and releas'd the <HI>virgin:</HI></L>
<L>Like the best doctors, did a method learn</L>
<L>Of curing fevers,—never to return.</L>
<L>Mayn't I this <HI>Giant-killing</HI> trade renew?</L>
<L>I have my <HI>virgin,</HI> and my <HI>monster</HI> too.</L>
<L>Though I can't boast, like <HI>Jack,</HI> a list of slain,</L>
<L>I wield a lancet, and can breathe a vein;</L>
<L>To his Herculean arm my nerves are weak,</L>
<L>He cleft his foes, I only make mine squeak;</L>
<L>As Indians wound their slaves to please the court,</L>
<L>I'll tickle mine, <HI>great sirs,</HI> to make you sport.</L>
<L>To prove myself an humble imitator,</L>
<L><HI>Giants</HI> are <HI>vices,</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> stands for satire:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
By tropes and figures, as it fancy suits,</L>
<L>Passions rise monsters, men sink down to brutes;</L>
<L>All talk and write in allegorick diction,</L>
<L>Court, city, town and country, run to fiction!</L>
<L>Each daily paper allegory teaches—</L>
<L><HI>Placemen</HI> are <HI>locusts,</HI> and <HI>contractors leeches;</HI></L>
<L>Nay e'en <HI>Change-Alley,</HI> where no bard repairs,</L>
<L>Deals much in fiction to pass off their wares;</L>
<L>Else whence that roaring there?—From bulls and bears?</L>
<L>The gaming fools are <HI>doves,</HI> the <HI>knaves</HI> are <HI>rooks,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Change-Alley</HI> bankrupts waddle out <HI>lame ducks!</HI></L>
<L>But, Ladies, blame not your gaming spouses,</L>
<L>For you, as well as they, have <HI>pidgeon-houses!</HI></L>
<L>To change the figure—formerly I've been</L>
<L>To straggling follies only <HI>whipper-in;</HI></L>
<L>By royal bounty rais'd, I mount the back</L>
<L>Of my own hunter, and I lead the <HI>Pack;</HI></L>
<L>Tallyho!—a rank old fox we now pursue,</L>
<L>So strong the scent, you'll run him full in view;</L>
<L>If we can't kill such <HI>brutes</HI> in human shape,</L>
<L>Let's fright 'em, that your <HI>chickens</HI> may escape;</L>
<L>Rouse em, when o'er their tender prey they're grumbling,</L>
<L>And rub their gums, at least to mar their mumb∣ling.</L>

<P>True, but what is become of your col∣league, honest Ned, I hope he has not quitted his place?</P>

So, Sir, you must possess a good share of assu∣rance to return to this town after the tricks you have play'd.

<P>Your reputation, that's a good jest!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sirrah, it is, and all owing to my acquaintance with you. I, forsooth, am call'd your

adviser; as if your own contriving head, and pro∣fligate heart, stood in need of any assistance from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but my dear Sir Kitt, how can this idle stuff affect you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Easy enough. I'll be judg'd by Poultice; Peter speak truth, before this here blot in my scutheon, have not you observ'd when I went to either a ball, or a breakfasting, how eagerly all the girls gathered round me, gibing and joking, and gigling, gad take me, as facetious and free as if I was their father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's truth, to my zertain knowledge, I have zeen the women folk titering 'till they were ready to split, when your honor was a throwing your <HI>double taunders</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For double entendres.</NOTE> about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Fillup; and tho' now and then a prudish slut would prim up her mouth when I gave her a sly stroke, yet the worst word that ever I got was, ah, you are a horrid wild toad; by what you are, one may guess what you have been!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except it be Seignior Trillins, the vamous foreign fine singer, his honor was the greatest favorite among the quality that ever I zeed. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As pretty and severe a sarcasm on the nobilities encou∣raging of Italian eunuchs, and insipid signoras, as ever came from the pen of Mr. Foote.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, honest Fillup,—before your curs'd affair, neither maid, widow, or wife, was ashamed of conversing with me; but now, when I am wheel'd into the room, not a soul under seventy will venture within ten yards of my chair. I am shunn'd worse than a leper in the days of king Lud; an absolute hermit in the midst of a croud: speak, Fillup, is not this a melancholy truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very mollycolly zure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not all. The crop-ear'd curs of the City have taken it into their empty heads to neglect me; formerly Mr. Mayor could not devour a custard, but I receiv'd a civil card to partake; but now the rude rascals, in their bushy bobs, brush by me without deigning to bow; in short, I don't believe I have had a cor∣poration-crust in my mouth for these six months—you might as well expect to meet a minister of state at the mansion-house, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to the majority of patriots in Alderman Beckford's may<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ralty, and perfectly expressive of the present one.</NOTE> as see me at one of their feasts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>His honor tells nothing but truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Tom, Tom, you have been a curs'd acquaintance to me; what a number of fine turtle and fat haunches of venison has your wickedness lost me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir Kitt, for this I merit your thanks; how often has Doctor Carawitchet told you, that your rich food, and champaign would produce nothing but poor health and real pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies the prattle of such a punning puppy as he; what, I suppose, you would starve me you scoundrel! when I am got out of one fit how the devil am I to gather strength to encounter the next. Do you think it is to be done by sipping, and slopping? But no matter,—look you, Major Racket, all between us is now at end; and, Sir, I should consider it as a par∣ticular favor if you would take no farther notice of me; I sincerely desire to drop your acquain∣tance: and as to myself, I am fix'd, positively fixed, to reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reform, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reform! And why not? Well, you shall see, the whole city shall see; as soon as ever I get to my lodgings I will send for Luke Latitat and codicil a handsome bequest to the hospital.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stuff.</P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha! You may laugh; but, if all this don't recover my credit, I am determin'd, besides, to hire a house in Harlequin Row, and be a constant hearer at the Countess's Chapel. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning the Countess Dowager of Hunt—don, who has a chapel at Bath.

<P>Don't you remember the bout we had at the Tuns in the days of plump Jack? I shall never forget; <Q>after you had fell'd poor Falstaff by a pint bumper of Burgundy, how you bestrode the prostrate hero, and in his own manner cry'd, “Crown me ye spirits that delight in generous wine!”</Q></P>

<P>Pooh, is that all; that ceremony was in∣deed formerly look'd upon as a kind of metapho∣rical grave; but the system is changed, and mar∣riage is now considered as a resurection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word, <HI>resurection,</HI> was objected to by the Lord Chamberlain, when the play was presented for his Lordship's approbation; and Mr. Foote chang'd it into <HI>entrance.</HI> An alteration that does equal honor to the Chamberlain and the Author.</NOTE> to a new and better kind of life.</P>

<P>Pshaw! who talks now of the drudgery of domestic duties, of nuptial chains and of bonds! Mere obsolete words! they did well enough in the dull days of queen Bess.

<P>The public! a fine stalking horse that; but I fear, like other pretenders, Tom, when your own private purpose is serv'd, the poor public will be left in the lurch;—but, however, the girl does deserve to be sav'd; and if I could do any thing not inconsistent with my plan of re∣forming—</P>

<P>Explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't you conceive what infinite struggles must have been felt by this fellow, before he could muster up courage enough to engage in this dreadful perilous state;—how often have you heard the proverbial puppy affirm, that marriage was fishing for a single eel amongst a barrel of snakes, what infinite odds that you laid hold of
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
the eel, and then a million to one but he slipp'd through your fingers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Tom, true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't you then guess what will be his feelings and fears when it comes to the push; dont you think the public opinion, his various doubts of himself and of her, the pride of his family, and the loud claims of avarice, his ruling passion till now, won't prove near an equepoize to his love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>

<P>At this critical period won't the concur∣ing advice of all his associates, think you, destroy the ballance at once?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very probable, Tom, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your worship is welcome to town—but where is Sir,—oh: I understood as how your honor had sent for me all in a hurry. I should have brought the patterns before, if I had them.

<P>No, nothing happen'd! I hope, affairs are all fix'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a rock; I am sure now it can't fail, because why, I have peremptory orders to scour and new line the coachmans and footman's old frocks; and am, besides, to turn the lace and fresh button the suit his honor had made up twenty years ago, come next Lent, when he was shrieve for the county.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then it is determined.</P>

<P>Or he would never have gone to such an expence!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Billy, and what is your private opinion, after all, of this match?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not becoming, your honor knows, for a tradesman, like me, to give his—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Don't you think, now Billy, it is a bold undertaking for a man at his time of life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, his honor is a little stricken in years, as a body may say; and take all the care that one can, time, time, will wear the nap from even superfine cloth: Stitches tear, and elbows will out as they say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. And besides, Bill, the bride's a meer baby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Little better, your honor; but she is a tight bit of stuff, and, I am confident, will turn out well in the wearing. I once had some thoughts, myself, of taking measure of Miss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and, to my thinking had made a pretty good progress; because why, at church, of a Sunday, she suffer'd me to look out for her the lessons and the text: and moreover, many a time and oft, we have sung psalms together out of the very same book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was going a good way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, besides, and more than all this, she has, at this precious minute of time, a pin∣cushion by her side of my own presentation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and how came the treaty broke off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, who should step in, in the nick, but the very Squire himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Bill, your beauty is a little bit of a jilt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, your worship, it is all along with her mother, 'cause her great aunt, by her father's side was a clergyman's daughter, she's as prag∣matic and proud as the Pope; so, sorsooth, no∣thing will please her, for Miss, but a bit of quality binding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew the refusal could not come from the girl; for without a compliment, Billy, there
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
is no comparison between you and the—why you are a pretty, slight, tight, light, nimble and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very nimble and slight, and we are both of a height. Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, love has made Billy a poet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, quite an accident as I hope to be kiss'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your rival is a fusty, foggy, lum∣bering old log.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all the world like my goose, plaguy hot and damn'd heavy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Billy blazes to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And tho' my purse, may-hap, ben't so heavy as his'n, yet I contrives to pay every body their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and have, besides, two houses in Avon street; and, perhaps, a bit or two of land in a corner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the curmudgeonly rogue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, moreover, if Madam Linnet talks of families, I would have her to know, that I have as powerful relations as well as herself. Why, there's Tommy Button, my uncle's own son, that has an employment under the government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Billy, what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this very precious minute of time, he's an exciseman at Wapping.—And, besides, there is my cousin, Paul Puff, that kept the great pastry cooks shop in the Strand, now

lives at Brentford, and is made a justice of peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>As this is the case, I dont think it will be difficult yet to bring matters to bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Butt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me help your—Folks may go farther and fare worse, as they say; why, I have some thoughts, if I can call in my debts, to retire into the country and set up for a gentleman.</P>

<P>Why not? one meets a great number of them who were never bred to the business.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Kitty, it is in vain to deny it. I am convinced there is some little, low, paltry passion, lurking in that breast of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear mother, you wrong me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Miss, but I don't! What else could induce you to reject the addresses of a lover like this? Ten thousand pounds a year! Gads my lise, there is not a lady in town would refuse him, let her rank be ever so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not his fortune, that I firmly believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! and who, now-a-days, marries for any thing else? Would you refuse an estate because it happens to be a little encumber'd? You must consider the man, in this case, as a kind of a mortgage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the disproportion of years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your favor, child,—the mortgage will be the sooner remov'd.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my dear Mother, our minds; how very widely they differ! my nature is liberal and frank, tho' I am but a little remov'd from mediocrity; but his heart, in the very bosom of wealth, is shut to every social sensation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Miss, this heart you have had the happiness to unlock. I hope you don't urge his offers to you as a proof of his passion for money! Why, you forget yourself, Kate; who, in the name of wonder do yo think that you are? What, because you have a baby face, and can bawl a few ballads—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, madam, you know I was never vain of my talents; if they can procure me a de∣cent support, and, in some measure, repay my father and you for their kind cultivation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>And▪ how long are you sure your talents, as you call them, will serve you?—Are a set of features secure against time; and won't a single sore throat destroy the boasted power of your pipe! But, suppose that should not fail, who can insure you against the whim of the public; will they always continue their favor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must become of you then? Now by this means you are safe, above the reach of ill fortune; besides, child, to put your own in∣terest out of the question, have you no tender feelings for us? Consider, my love, you don't want for good nature; and your consent to this
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
match, will, in the worst of times, secure a firm and able friend to the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss L.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deceive yourself, indeed, my dear mother: He a friend! I dare believe, the first proof you will find of his friendship, will be, his positive commands to break off all correspondence with every relation I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a likely story indeed!—Well, child, I must set your father to work, I find what little weight my arguments have.</P>

<L>Who sins on <HI>claret!</HI> and repents on <HI>tea!</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="76"/>
The <HI>witless Macaroni</HI> who purloins</L>
<L>A few cant words, which some pert gambler coins!</L>
<L>The undomestic Amazonian dame,</L>
<L>Staunch to her coteric in despight of shame!</L>
<L>These are the objects of our poet's plan;</L>
<L>But most, that monster, an unfeeling man!</L>
<L>When such a foe provokes him to the fight,</L>
<L>Tho' maim'd, out sallies, the puissant knight!</L>
<L>Like With'rington maintains the glorious strife,</L>
<L>And only yields his laurels with his life!</L>
