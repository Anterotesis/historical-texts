MY Bookseller informs me, that the Bulk of his Readers, regarding in a Work of this Kind the Quantity more than the Quality, will not be contented without an additional half Sheet; and he apprehends that a short Dedica∣tion will answer the Purpose.</P>
<P>BUT as I have no Obligations to any great Man or Woman in this Country, and as I will take Care that no Production of mine shall want their Patronage, I don't know any Person whose good Offices I so much stood in need of as my Bookseller's: Therefore, Mr. VAILLANT, I think myself obliged to you for the Correctness of the Press, the Beauty of the Type, and the Goodness of the Paper, with which you have decorated this Work of</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Between Mr. MACKLIN and his WIFE.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L>TO contradict me!—Blockhead! Ideot! Fool! Sot!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HE.</SPEAKER>
<L>But amidst these hard Names, our Dispute is forgot.</L>
<L>To contradict you I know is High-Treason;</L>
<L>For the Will of a Wife is always her Reason.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, Sir, for once, I'll give up my Pre∣tension,</L>
<L>And submit to the Pit our Cause of Dissention.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HE.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>I agree; for the Pit is our natural Lord.</HI></L>
<L>LADIES,——</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>—Hey! How come you to claim the first Word?</HI></L>
<L>GENTLEMEN, <HI>my Husband and I have had a Dis∣pute,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where the Difference lies 'twixt a Man and a Brute;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which we beg, whilst the Folks for the Farce are preparing,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You would please to decide, and give us the Hearing.</HI></L>
<L><HI>—Hem! Hem!—</HI></L>
<L><HI>After</HI> Plutarch <HI>of</HI> Rome! <HI>and</HI> Virgil <HI>of</HI> Greece!</L>
<L><HI>And</HI> Iliads, <HI>and</HI> Eniends, <HI>and Authors like these;</HI></L>
<L><HI>I boldly affirm, deny it who can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That in Laughter consists the true Essence of Man.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<HI>Whilst my Husband—</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HE.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>—Nay, pray let me state my own Case,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I'll make it as clear as the Nose in your Face,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That hissing in Man preserves the first Place.</HI></L>
<L><HI>To begin then with Critics;—'Tis their capital Bliss,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than to laugh,—don't you find it more pleasing to hiss?</HI></L>
<L><HI>In this all agree;—</HI>Jews! Infidels! Turks!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>I grant it, sweet Sir,—if you mean at your Works.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet even 'gainst that I've a potent Objection;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For every Rule still has its Exception:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho' they hiss'd at your Farces, your</HI> Pasquin <HI>and Stuff,</HI></L>
<L><HI>At your Tragedy sure they laugh'd hearty enough.</HI></L>
<L><HI>And again, Mr. Wiseman, regard the World round,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis in Mankind alone that Laughter is found;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whilst your favourite hissing, sage Sir, if you please,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You enjoy but in common with Serpents and Geese.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L>And ar'nt you ashamed—('tis no Time to dissemble,)</L>
<L>O Critics! these Creatures in this to resemble?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not a Jot; in this Place 'tis of singular Use,</L>
<L>Of bad Poets and Players to reform the Abuse.</L>
<L>In the Practice, kind Sirs! were I fit to advise,</L>
<L>The hissing like Geese I would have you despise,</L>
<L>And copy the Serpent,—be subtle and wise,</L>
<L>But free from his Venom.—Well, Sirs! What d'ye say?</L>
<L>Is your Judgment—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Let us wait 'till the End of the Play:</L>
<L>In the Progress of that we shall easily find,</L>
<L>Whether laughing or hissing is most to their Mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm sure they will hiss.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHE.</SPEAKER>
<L>And I hope they'll be kind.</L>

<P>Is a Fop; it is their national Disease; not one of the Qualities for which you celebrate them, but owes it's Origin to a Foible; their Taste is Trifling, their Gaiety Grimace, and their Politeness, Pride.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-dey! Why what the Duce brings you to <HI>Paris</HI> then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Debt to Friendship; not but I think a short Residence here, a very neces∣sary Part in every Man of Fashion's Edu∣cation.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where's the Use?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>In giving them a true relish for their own domestic Happiness, a proper Ve∣neration for their national Liberties; a Con∣tempt for Adulation; and an Honour for the extended generous Commerce of their Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there, indeed, you have the preference, Master <HI>Classic;</HI> the Traders here are a sharp Set; cozening People; Foreigners are their Food; Civilities with a—Aye! aye! a Congee for a Crown, and a Shrug for a Shilling; devilish dear, Master <HI>Classic,</HI> devilish dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>To avoid their Exactions, we are, Mr. <HI>Subtle,</HI> recommended to your Protec∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! and wisely they did, who recommended you: Buy nothing' but on mine or my Lady's Recommendation, and you are safe. But where was your Charge? Where was Mr. <HI>Buck</HI> last Night? My Lady made a Party at Cards, on purpose for him, and my Ward <HI>Lucinda</HI> is mightily taken with him; she longs to see him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid with the same Set his Father sent him hither to avoid; but we must endeavour to inspire him with a Taste for the Galantries of this Court, and his Passion for the lower Amusements of ours will diminish of course.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>Comrades, who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rog.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dick Daylight</HI> and <HI>Bob Breadbasket</HI> the Bruisers: They all went to the Shew to∣gether, where they had the Devil to pay; belike they had been sent to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> hadn't a great Gentleman in a blue String come by and releas'd them.—I hear Master's Bell; do, Master <HI>Classic,</HI> step up and talk to 'un; he's now sober, and may hearken to Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>I attend him. Mr. <HI>Subtle,</HI> you won't be out of the Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall talk a little with the Tradesmen. A smoaky Fellow, this <HI>Classic;</HI> but if <HI>Lucinda</HI> plays her Cards well, we have not much to fear from that Quarter: Contradiction seems to be the Life and Soul of young <HI>Buck.—</HI>A tolerable Expedition this,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
if it succeeds.—Fleece the Younker!—Pshaw, that's a Thing of Course!—but by his Means to get rid of <HI>Lucinda,</HI> and se∣curely pocket her Patrimony;—aye! that indeed—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Subtle.</STAGE>
<P>Oh! Wife! Have you open'd the Plot? Does the Girl come into it greedily, hey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little squeamish at first; but I have open'd her Eyes. Never fear, my Dear, sooner or later Women will attend to their Interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Interest! aye, that's true; but consider, my Dear, how deeply our own Interest is concern'd, and let that quicken your Zeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye think I am blind? But the Girl has got such whimsical Notions of Honour, and is withal so decent and mo∣dest: I wonder where the Deuce she got it; I am sure it was not in my House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does she like <HI>Buck</HI>'s Per∣son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well enough! But prithee, Husband, leave her to my Management, and consider we have more Irons in the Fire than one. Here is the <HI>Marquis de Soleil</HI> to meet <HI>Madam de Farde</HI> to Night,—and where to put 'em, unless we can have <HI>Buck</HI>'s Apartment; Oh! by the bye, has <HI>Count Cog</HI>

<P>I intend calling on him this Morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fail! He's a slippery Chap you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no fear. Well, but our pretty Countrywoman lays about her hand∣somely! Ha!—Hearts by Hundreds! Hum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! that's a noble Prize, if we could but manage her; but she's so in∣discreet, that she'll be blown before we have made half our Market. I am this Morning to give Audience on her Score, to two Counts and a foreign Minister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then strike whilst the Iron's hot: But they'll be here before I can talk to my People; send 'em in, prythee.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Tradesmen.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Gentlemen; Oh! hush! we are interrupted: If they ask for your Bills, you have left them at Home.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Buck, Classic <HI>and</HI> Roger.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, I don't know how it ended, but I remember how it begun. Oh! Ma∣ster <HI>Subtle,</HI> how do'st, old Buck, hey? Give's
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
thy Paw! And little <HI>Lucy</HI> how fares it with she? Hum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has been the Matter, Squire? Your Face seems a little in Desha∣bile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Touch of the Times, old Boy! a small Skirmish; after I was down tho', a Set of cowardly Sons of—; there's <HI>George</HI> and I will box any five for their Sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how happen'd it? The <HI>French</HI> are generally civil to Strangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! damn'd civil! to fall seven or eight upon three: Seven or eight! Ecod we had the whole House upon us at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what had you done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Done! Why nothing at all! But Wounds how the Powder flew about, and the Monsieurs scour'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Offence had either they or you committed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I was telling Domine, last Night, <HI>Dick Daylight, Bob Breadbasket</HI> and I were walking through one of their <HI>Rues</HI> I think they call them here, they are Streets in <HI>London;</HI> but they have such devilish out-of-the-way Names for Things, that there is no remembering them; so we see Crowds of People going into a House, and <HI>Comedy</HI> pasted over the Door; in we troop'd with the rest, pay'd our Cash, and sat down on the Stage; presently they had a Dance; and one of the young Women with long Hair
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
trailing behind her, stood with her Back to a Rail, just by me: Ecod what does me! for nothing in the World but a Joke, as I hope for Mercy, but ties her Locks to the Rail; so when 'twas her Turn to figure out, souse she flapp'd on her Back; 'twas devilish comical, but they set up such an Uproar, one whey-fac'd Son of a Bitch, that came to loose the Woman, turn'd up his Nose, and call'd me <HI>Bête;</HI> Ecod, I lent him a Lick in his Lanthorn Jaws, that will make him re∣member the Spawn of old <HI>Marlborough,</HI> I warrant him: Another came up to second him, but I let drive at the Mark, made the Soup-Maigre rumble in his Bread-basket, and laid him sprawling; then in pour'd a Million of them; I was knock'd down in a trice; and what happen'd after I know no more than you. But where's <HI>Lucy?</HI> I'll go see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fye! Ladies are treated here with a little more Ceremony: Mr. <HI>Subtle</HI> too has collected these People, who are to equip you for the Conversation of the Ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounds! all these! What, Mr. <HI>Subtle,</HI> these are Mounseeres too I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! Squire, they are <HI>English∣men:</HI> Fashion has ordain'd, that as you em∣ploy none but Foreigners at home, you must take up with your own Countrymen here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Class.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not in this instance alone we are particular, Mr. <HI>Subtle;</HI> I have observ'd
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
many of our pretty Gentlemen, who con∣descend to use entirely their native Lan∣guage here, sputter nothing but bad <HI>French</HI> in the Side-boxes at Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Sir, as to you, and your Wife, and Miss <HI>Lucy,</HI> I like you all well enough; but the Devil a good Thing else have I seen since I lost Sight of <HI>Dover;</HI> the Men are all Puppies, mincing and dancing, and chattering, and grinning: the Women a Parcel of painted Dolls; their Food's fit for Hogs; and as for their Lan∣guage, let them learn it that like it, I'll none on't; no, nor their Frippery neither: So here you may all march to the Place from whence you—Harkee! What are you an <HI>Englishman?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Barber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Domine!</HI> Look here, what a Mon∣ster the Monkey has made of himself? Sir∣rah! if your String was long enough, I'd do your Business myself you Dog, to sink a bold <HI>Briton</HI> into such a sneaking, snivel∣ling—the Rascal looks as if he had not had a Piece of Beef and Pudding in his Paunch these twenty Years; I'll be hang'd if the Rogue ha'nt been fed upon Frogs ever since he came over. Away with your Trumpery!</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Buck,</HI> a Compliance with the Customs of the Country in which we live,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Squire, <HI>Lucinda</HI> ex∣pects that you should usher her to public Places; which it would be impossible to do in that Dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sub.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'd be mobb'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mobb'd! I should be glad to see that.—No! no! they ha'nt Spirit enough to mob here; but come, since these Fellows here are <HI>English,</HI> and it is the Fashion, try on your Fooleries.</P>

<P>A Truce; a Truce, I beseech you, Gentlemen: It seems I am the golden Prize for which you plead; produce your Preten∣sions; you are the Representatives of your respective Countries; begin, Marquis, for the Honour of <HI>France:</HI> Let me hear what Advantages I am to derive from a Conjugal Union with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Abstracted from those which I think are pretty visible; a perpetual Resi∣dence in this Paradise of Pleasures; to be the Object of universal Adoration; to say what you please, go where you will, do what you like, form Fashions, hate your Husband, and let him see it; indulge your Galant, and let t'other know it; run in Debt, and oblige the poor Devil to pay it. He! Ma chere! There are Pleasures for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! Marquis! These are Allure∣ments for a Woman of Spirit; but don't let us conclude too hastily; hear the other Side:

What have you to offer, Mr. <HI>Buck,</HI> in fa∣vour of <HI>England?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, for a Woman of Spirit, they give you the same Advantages in <HI>London</HI> as at <HI>Paris,</HI> with a Privilege forgot by the Marquis, an indisputable Right to cheat at Cards, in spight of Detection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, we have the same; but I thought this Privilege so known and universal, that 'twas needless to mention it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll give up nothing, I find; but to tell you my blunt Thoughts, in a Word, if any Woman can be so abandon'd, as to rank amongst the Comforts of Matrimony, the Privilege of hating her Husband, and the Liberty of committing every Folly and every Vice contained in your Catalogue, she may stay single for me; for damn me, if I'm a Husband fit for her Humour; that's all.</P>

<P>But stay, what have you to offer as Counterbalance for these Pleasures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>

<P>Sir, I am oblig'd to you for this Declaration, as, to it I owe the entire Subjection of that paternal Weakness, which has hitherto suspended the Cor∣rection your abandon'd Libertinism has long provok'd.

<P>A stale, obvious Artifice! She knew the Discovery of the Fraud must follow close on your inconsiderate Marriage, and would then plead the Merits of her prior candid Discovery: The Lady, doubtless Sir, has other Secrets to disclose; but as her Cun∣ning reveal'd the first, her Policy will pre∣serve the rest.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Perhaps a thousand! But I am to blame to call them Secrets; the Customs of this gay Country give Sanction, and stamp Merit upon Vice; and Vanity will here proclaim what Modesty would else∣where blush to whisper.</P>

<P>Modesty!—You suspect my Virtue then!</P>

<P>You are a Lady; but the Fears of a Father may be permitted to neglect a little your Plan of Politeness: Therefore, to be plain; from your Residence in this House, from your Connexion with these People, and from the Scheme which my Presence has interrupted, I have Suspicions—of what Nature, ask yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have Reason, Appearances are against me, I confess, but when you have heard my melancholy Story, you'll own you have wrong'd me, and learn to pity her whom now you hate.</P>

<P>Madam, you misemploy your Time; there tell your Story, there it will be be∣liev'd; I am too knowing in the Wiles of Women, to be soften'd by a Syren Tear, or impos'd on by an artful Tale.</P>

misguided by pernicious Politics, brought with him, in her earliest Infancy, to <HI>France,</HI> that dying here, he bequeath'd me, with the poor remnant of our shatter'd Fortune, to the Direction of this rapacious Pair; I am sure you'll tremble for me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>My poor Girl! I indeed, have wrong'd, but will redress you, and pray, Sir, after the many pressing Letters you received
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
from me, how came this Truth concealed? but I guess your Motive; dry up your Tears, <HI>Luci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da,</HI> at last you have found a Father. Hence ye degenerate, ye abandon'd wretches, who, abusing the Confidence of your Coun∣try, unite to plunder those ye promise to pro∣tect.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Disclaim the Partners of your Riot, polish your Manners, reform your Pleasures, and before you think of go∣verning others, learn to direct yourself. And now, my beauteous Ward, we'll for the Land where first you saw the Light, and there endeavour to forget the long long Bondage you have suffer'd here; I suppose, Sir, we shall have no Difficulty
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
in persuading you to accompany us; it is not in <HI>France</HI> I am to hope for your Re∣formation. I have now learn'd, that he who transports a profligate Son to <HI>Paris,</HI> by Way of mending his Manners, only adds the Vices and Folli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of that Country to those of his own.</P>
