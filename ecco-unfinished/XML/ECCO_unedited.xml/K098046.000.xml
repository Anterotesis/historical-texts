<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Receiv'd Your's Dated the 3d. Instant,
wherein you inform me of having
read in <HI>Applebee</HI>'s Weekly Journal an
Account of the Loss of Mr. KEENE
the late emin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Tragedian; and have
intimated, that you shou'd be glad to
know some Passages in relation to his Life. Ac∣cordingly
at Your Request, I have Collected the fol∣lowing
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
Narrative from the Hands of one of his
nearest Relations, in order to oblige you, and the
Curious part of the World.</P>
<P>As to the Character of his private Life in relati∣on
to his Morals, I shall here take but very little
Notice, lest whilst in reality I shou'd be giving
him his due Praises, I might be Censured by those
that were not intimately Acquainted with him to be
guilty of Flattery.</P>
<P>To proceed then to an Account of his Life. He
was Born of <HI>Dissenting</HI> Parents, Educated at the
<HI>Presbyterian Academy</HI> in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> and design'd
by his Friends for a <HI>Dissenting</HI> Teacher. He
acquired by his Studies a Knowledge of Men
and Books; the former of which was a discreet
Guide to his Actions, and the latter an Ornament
to the natural Beauties of his Mind, which was no
small Advantage to him in his Profession. He cou'd
not have given a greater Proof of his Judgment
than by renouncing those Errors in his Maturity,
which he had been train'd up in from his Youth;
and indeed he show'd as great an instance of his
Honesty, when he chose, rather to quit a Fortune
amongst his Wealthy Relations, than to act con∣trary
to the Sentiments of his Soul, or in plain
Terms, to dissemble his Principles.</P>
<P>WHETHER Necessity or Inclination led him
to the Stage, I cannot possibly learn, but I believe
Both, for we may guess the Probability of the for∣mer
from his being abandon'd by his Friends upon
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
Account of his Principles, and of the latter from
those admirable Performances that so often gain'd
him an universal Applause, and establish'd him so
great a Reputation in the Town. Where his first
Appearance in his Profession was, I could never
hear; but it is certain, he Acted several Years in
the Countries as one of the Company that was
Govern'd by Mr. <HI>Coysh,</HI> who was an eminent Actor
in the time of Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mohun:</HI> From
him we may believe he received his first Instru∣ctions
in the Business, which his own Judgment
and constant Practice improv'd to so great a Per∣fection.
During this part of his Life, he married
one Mrs. <HI>Wilmot,</HI> a Person endow'd with uncom∣mon
Qualifications; but to Sum up all, a tender
Wife, and a very sorrowful Widow. After ha∣ving
left Mr. <HI>Coysh</HI>'s Company, I am inform'd he
appeared upon the Stage in <HI>Dublin,</HI> from thence
he returned to <HI>England,</HI> and soon got a Reputati∣on
from his Performances here. The first part in
which he signaliz'd himself to the Town, was
that of Justice <HI>Ballance</HI> in the <HI>Recruiting Officer,</HI>
of which he was the Original.—When there was
no other Company of Comedians but his Majesty's,
he Acted at the Theatre Royal as one of those,
and got a very great Reputation by the Parts of
<HI>Montezuma</HI> in the <HI>Indian Emperor, Creon</HI> in <HI>Oedipus,</HI>
Sir <HI>Edward Belfond</HI> in the Squire of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> Sir
<HI>Solomon Single, Jago</HI> in <HI>Othello, Aecius</HI> in <HI>Valentinian,
Henry</HI> the Fourth, and several Others. When Mr.
<HI>Rich</HI> Open'd his House in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> he
went over to that Company with several Others,
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
and appear'd still to a greater Advantage; he
Acted the Parts of <HI>Hannibal, Dorax</HI> in <HI>Don Se∣bastian,
Clitus</HI> in <HI>Alexander the Great, Dioclesian,
Gerrard</HI> in the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Bush,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Brute</HI>
in the <HI>Provok'd Wife</HI> with great Applause; how∣ever
he was sometimes, for want of principal Peo∣ple,
forc'd to perform Parts out of his manner of
Playing; for as he carried the Stamp of Majesty
in his Presence, and the stern Roughness of
a Soldier in his Voice; the Softness of a Lover
cou'd not consequently sit so Natural upon him,
tho' indeed, his Performance even of those Parts,
spoke that admirable Judgment which he was so
much Master of.—In the beginning of the Year
1717, he joyn'd with Mr. <HI>Christopher Bullock,</HI> in
taking the Master-ship of that Company for Four
Years from Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> by an Agreement settled
between 'em.—This Crown'd the Reputation he
had before gain'd: In the midst of the first Sea∣son
he had a very great Fit of Illness, of which
he afterwards Recovered: But before the begin∣ning
of the Second, he had the fatal Misfortune
of a Fall from his Horse, by which, gaining a
mortal Hurt, he lay some few Days, and then expir'd
about the 38th. Year of his Age.—As a Proof
of his Generosity to People of Merit in Distress,
I can't but take Notice of an odd Accident that
happen'd since his Death. An Eminent Divine
that is now under some Afflictions, asking for
him at his House, (being ignorant of his Illness)
the Maid told him her Master was above Stairs,
he desired to see him; whereupon the Maid, without
informing him farther, Conducted the Gentleman to
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
the Chamber where Mr. KEENE lay Dead, but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Entrance he was so surpriz'd to see the
Corpse of one he so much lov'd, that he Swoon∣ed,
and lay some time before he cou'd be brought
to himself; but upon his Recovery he burst in∣to
Tears, and declared he had lost the only
Friend that had succour'd him amidst his Mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>HIS Death being on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> on the <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI>
following he was carried from his House
in <HI>Cooks-Court</HI> by <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> to be Interr'd
in the Parish Church of St. <HI>Clement Danes,</HI> the
Pall was held up by three Gentlemen from each
Theatre, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Mills</HI> from the Old House, and Mr. <HI>Bullock</HI> Sen.
Mr. <HI>Spiller,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Corey</HI> from the New: Mr.
<HI>Christopher Bullock</HI> appeared as Chief Mourner,
and the Corpse was follow'd by the Actors of
each Theatre (most of 'em in Black) in great De∣cency.—Thus
they proceeded to the Church,
where there was a very fine Anthem perform'd;
afterwards he was Buried in a Vault, where lye
Mr. <HI>Mountford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Horden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Powel,</HI> who
were all Eminent in the same Profession.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, having finish'd my Relation, I now
recommend you to the perusal of some Verses
here prefix'd, Written by different Hands upon this
Occasion, and I don't <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestion but the Subject

<L>Then thus the Friendly shade, (whose awful Mien,</L>
<L>And Manly Features spoke Majestick KEENE)</L>
<L>No longer fruitless Mourn in idle Verse,</L>
<L>Nor wet with Tears virile my Sable Hearse.</L>
<L>Almighty <HI>Jove</HI> does every Fate ordain,</L>
<L>And Death oft frees us from a world of Pain:</L>
<L>The Vertuous Man no Death can ever fear,</L>
<L>'Tis truly Death that binds poor Mortals here;</L>
<L>For in the Grave, no <HI>Death</HI> but <HI>Life</HI> we find,</L>
<L>A Life Immortal to a Vertuous Mind.</L>
<L>Thus Spoke the Shade! Then wing'd sublime his Way</L>
<L>Thro' tracts of Light, that form'd a new Born Day.</L>
