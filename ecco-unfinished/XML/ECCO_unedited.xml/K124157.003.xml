<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pleadings of Pity.</HEAD>
<P>TO oblige Mr. Tyrold, who had made the arrange∣ment
with Sir Hugh, Eugenia consented to dine and
spend the day at Etherington, which she quitted at
night in a temper of mind perfectly composed.</P>
<P>Camilla was deeply penetrated by the whole of this
affair. The sufferings, so utterly unearned by fault
or by folly, of a sister so dear to her, and the affecting
fortitude which, so quickly upon her wounds, and at
so early a period of life, she already began to display,
made her blush at the dejection into which she was her∣self
cast by every evil, and resolve to become in future
more worthy of the father and the sister, who at this
moment absorbed all her admiration.</P>
<P>Too reasonable, in such a frame of mind, to plan
forgetting Mandlebert she now only determined to
think of him as she had thought before her affections
became entangled; to think of him, in short, as he
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
seemed himself to desire; to seek his friendly offices
and advice, but to reject every offered establishment,
and to live single for life.</P>
<P>Gratified by indulgent praise, and sustained by ex∣erted
virtue, the revived Eugenia had nearly reached
Cleves, on her return, when the carriage was stopt by
a gentleman on horseback, who, approaching the coach
window, said, in a low voice, as if unwilling to be heard
by the servants—“O, Madam! has Fate set aside
her cruelty? and does Fortune permit me to live once
more?”</P>
<P>She then recollected Mr. Bellamy. She had only
her maid in the carriage, who was sent for her by Sir
Hugh, Miss Margland being otherwise engaged.</P>
<P>All that had so lately passed upon her person and ap∣pearance
being full upon her mind, she involuntarily
shrunk back, hiding her face with her cloak.</P>
<P>Bellamy, by no means conceiving this mark of emo∣tion
to be unfavourable, steadied his horse, by leaning
one hand on the coach-window, and said, in a yet lower
voice—“O, Madam! is it possible you can hate me
so barbarously?—will you not even deign to look at
me, though I have so long been banished from your pre∣sence?”</P>
<P>Eugenia, during this speech, called to mind, that
though new, in some measure, to herself, she was not
so to this gentleman, and ventured to uncover her face;
when the grief painted on the fine features of Bellamy,
so forcibly touched her, that she softly answered “No,
Sir, indeed I do not hate you; I am incapable of
such ingratitude; but I conjure—I beseech you to for∣get
me!”</P>
<P>“Forget you?—O, Madam! you command an im∣possibility!
—No, I am constancy itself, and not all the
world united shall tear you from my heart!”</P>
<P>Jacob, who caught a world or two, now rode up to
the other window, and as Eugenia began—“Conquer,
Sir, I entreat you, this ill-fated partiality!—” told her
the horses had been hard-worked, and must go home.</P>
<P>As Jacob was the oracle of Sir Hugh about his horses,
his will was prescriptive law; Eugenia never disputed
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
it, and only saying,—“Think of me, Sir, no more!”
bid the coachman drive on.</P>
<P>Bellamy, respectfully submitting, continued, with his
hat in his hand, as the maid informed her mistress,
looking after the carriage till it was out of sight.</P>
<P>A tender sorrow now stole upon the just revived tran∣quillity
of the gentle and generous Eugenia. “Ah!”
thought she, “I have rendered, little as I seem worthy
of such a power, I have rendered this amiable man
miserable, though possibly, and probably, he is the only
man in existence whom I could render happy!—Ah!
how may I dare expect from Clermont a similar-pas∣sion?”</P>
<P>Molly Mill, a very young girl, and daughter of a
poor tenant of Sir Hugh, interrupted these reflections
from time to time, with remarks upon their object.
“Dearee me, Miss,” she cried, “what a fine gentle∣man
that was!—he sighed like to split his heart when
you said, don't think about me no more. He's some
loveyer, like, I'm sure.”</P>
<P>Eugenia returned home so much moved by this in∣cident,
that Sir Hugh, believing his brother himself
had failed to revive her, was disturbed all anew with
acute contrition for her disasters, and feeling very un∣well,
went to bed before supper time.</P>
<P>Eugenia retired also; and after spending the even∣ing
in soft compassion for Bellamy, and unfixed appre∣hensions
and distaste for young Lynmere, was prepar∣ing
to go to bed, when Molly Mill, out of breath with
haste, brought her a letter.</P>
<P>She eagerly opened it, whilst enquiring whence it
came.</P>
<P>“O, Miss, the fine gentleman—that same fine gen∣tleman
—brought it himself: and he sent for me out,
and I did not know who I was to go to, for Mary
only said a boy wanted me; but the boy said, I must
come with him to the style; and when I come there,
who should I see but the fine gentleman himself! And
he gave me this letter, and he asked me to give it you
—and see! look Miss! what I got for my trouble!”</P>
<P>She then exhibited a half-guinea.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
“You have not done right, Molly, in accepting it.
Money is bribery; and you should have known that the
letter was improperly addressed, if bribery was requisite
to make it be delivered.”</P>
<P>“Dearee me, Miss, what's half-a-guinea to such a
gentleman as that? I dare say he's got his pockets full
of them!”</P>
<P>“I shall not read it, certainly,” cried Eugenia,
“now I know this circumstance. Give me the wax—
I will seal it again.”</P>
<P>She then hesitated whether she ought to return it, or
shew it to her uncle, or commit it to the flames.</P>
<P>That to which she was most unwilling, appeared, to
the strictness of her principles, to be most proper:
she therefore determined that the next morning she
would relate her evening's adventure, and deliver the
unread letter to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Had this epistle not perplexed her, she had meant
never to name its writer. Persuaded her last words had
finally dismissed him, she thought it a high point of
female delicacy never to publish an unsuccessful con∣quest.</P>
<P>This resolution taken, she went to bed, satisfied with
herself, but extremely grieved at the sufferings she was
preparing for one who so singularly loved her.</P>
<P>The next morning, however, her uncle did not rise
to breakfast, and was so low spirited, that fearing to dis∣turb
him, she deemed it most prudent to defer the com∣munication.</P>
<P>But when, after she had taken her lesson from Dr.
Orkborne, she returned to her room, she found Molly
Mill impatiently waiting for her: “O, Miss,” she
cried, “here's another letter for you! and you must
read it directly, for the gentleman says if you don't it
will be the death of him.”</P>
<P>“Why did you receive another letter?” said Eugenia,
displeased.</P>
<P>“Dearee me, Miss, how could I help it? if you'd
seen the taking he was in, you'd have took it yourself.
He was all of a quake, and ready to go down of his
two knees. Dearee me, if it did not make my heart
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
go pit-pat to see him! He was like to go out of his
mind, he said, and the tears, poor gentleman, were all
in his eyes.”</P>
<P>Eugenia now turned away, strongly affected by this
description.</P>
<P>“Do, Miss,” continued Molly, write him a little
scrap, if its never so scratched and bad. He'll take it
kinder than nothing. Do, Miss, do. Don't be ill∣natured.
And just read this little letter, do Miss,
do;—it won't take you much time, you reads so nice
and fast.”</P>
<P>“Why,” cried Eugenia, “did you go to him
again? how could you so incautiously entrust yourself
to the conduct of a strange boy?”</P>
<P>“A strange boy! dearee me, Miss, don't you know
it was Tommy Hodd? I knows him will enough; I
knows all the boys, I warrant me, round about here.
Come, Miss, here's pen and ink; you'll run it off be∣fore
one can count five, when you've a mind to it.
He'll be in a sad taking till he sees me come back.”</P>
<P>“Come back?” is it possible you have been so impru∣dent
as to have promised to see him again?</P>
<P>“Dearee me, yes, Miss! he'd have made away
with himself if I had not. He'd been there ever since
six in the morning, without nothing to eat or drink, a
riding up and down the road, till he could see me com∣ing
to the style. And he says he'll keep a riding
there all day long, and all night too, till I goes to
him.”</P>
<P>Eugenia conceived herself now in a situation of un∣exampled
distress. She forced Molly Mill to leave
her, that she might deliberate what course to pursue.</P>
<P>Having read no novels, her imagination had never
been awakened to scenes of this kind; and what she
had gathered upon such subjects in the poetry and his∣tory
she had studied with Dr. Orkborne, had only im∣pressed
her fancy in proportion as love bore the charac∣ter
of heroism, and the lover that of an hero. Though
highly therefore romantic, her romance was not the
common adoption of a circulating library: it was sim∣ply
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
that of elevated sentiments, formed by animated cre∣dulity
playing upon youthful inexperience.</P>
<P>“Alas!” cried she, “what a conflict is mine! I
must refuse a man who adores me to distraction, in dis∣regard
of my unhappy defects, to cast myself under the
guidance of one, who perhaps, may estimate beauty so
highly as to despise me for its want!”</P>
<P>This idea pleaded so powerfully for Bellamy, that
something like a wish to open his letters, obtained par∣don
to her little maid for having brought them. She
suppressed, however, the desire, though she held them
alternately to her eyes, conjecturing their contents, and
bewailing for their impassioned writer the cruel answer
they must receive.</P>
<P>Though checked by shame, she had some desire to
consult Camilla; but she could not see her in time,
Mrs. Arlbery having insisted upon carrying her in the
evening to a play, which was to be performed, for
one night only, by a company of passing strollers at North∣wick.</P>
<P>“My decision,” she cried, “must be my own, and
must be immediate. Ah! how leave a man such as
this, to wander night and day neglected and uncertain
of his fate! With tears he sent me his letters!—
what must not have been his despair when such was his
sensibility? tears in a man!—tears, too, that could not
be restrained even till his messenger was out of sight!—
how touching!—”</P>
<P>Her own then fell, in tender commiseration, and it
was with extreme repugnance she compelled herself to
take such measures as she thought her duty required.
She sealed the two letters in an empty cover, and hav∣ing
directed them to Mr. Bellamy, summoned Molly
Mill, and told her to convey them to the gentleman, and
positively acquaint him she must receive no more, and
that those which were returned had never been read.
She bid her, however, add, that she should always wish
for his happiness, and be grateful for his kind partiality;
though she earnestly conjured him to vanquish a regard
which she did not deserve, and must never return.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Molly Mill would fain have remonstrated; but Eu∣genia,
with that firmness which, even in the first youth,
accompanies a consciousness of preferring duty to incli∣nation,
silenced, and sent her off.</P>
<P>Relieved for herself, now the struggle was over, she
secretly rejoiced that it was not for Melmond she had so
hard a part to act: and this idea, while it rendered
Bellamy less an object of regret, diminished also some∣thing
of her pity for his conflict, by reminding her of
the success which had attended her own similar exer∣tions.</P>
<P>But when Molly returned, her distress was renewed:
she brought her these words, written with a pencil upon
the back of her own cover:</P>
<P>“I do not dare, cruellest of your sex, to write you
another letter; but if you would save me from the abyss
of destruction, you will let me hear my final doom
from your own mouth. I ask nothing more! Ah!
walk but one moment in the park, near the pales;
deny not your miserable adorer this last single request,
and he will fly this fatal climate which has swallowed
up his repose for ever! But, till then, here he will
stay, and never quit the spot whence he sends you these
lines, till you have deigned to pronounce verbally his
doom, though he should farnish for want of food!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ALPHONSO BELLAMY.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Eugenia read this with horror and compassion. She
imagined he perhaps thought her confined, and would
therefore believe no answer that did not issue immedi∣ately
from her own lip. She sent Molly to him again
with the same message; but Molly returned with a yet
worse account of his desperation, and a strong assurance,
that if she would only utter to him a single word, he
would obey, depart, and live upon it the rest of his
life.</P>
<P>This completely softened her. Rather than impe∣riously
suffer such a pattern of respectful constancy to
perish, she consented to speak her own negative. But
fearing she might be moved to some sympathy by his
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
grief, she resolved to be accompanied by Camilla,
and deferred, therefore the interview till the next
day.</P>
<P>Molly brought back his humble acknowledgments
for this concession, and an account that, at last, slowly
and sadly he had ridden away.</P>
<P>Her feelings were now better satisfied than her un∣derstanding.
She feared what she had granted was a
favour; yet her heart was too tender to reproach a
compliance made upon such conditions, and to prevent
such evils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The disastrous Buskins.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, though her personal sorrows were
blunted by the view of the calamities and resignation
of her sister, was so little disposed for amusement, that
she had accepted the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery, only
from wanting spirit to resist its urgency. Mr. Tyrold
was well pleased that such a recreation came in her way,
but desired Lavinia might be of the party: not only
that she might partake of the same pleasure, but from a
greater security in her prudence, than in that of her na∣turally
thoughtless sister.</P>
<P>The town of Etherington afforded no theatre; and
the room fitted up for the night's performance could
contain but two boxes, one of which was secured for
Mrs. Arlbery and her friends.</P>
<P>The attentive Major was ready to offer his hand to
Camilla upon her arrival. The rest of the officers were
in the box.</P>
<P>The play was Othello; and so miserably represent∣ed,
that Lavinia would willingly have retired after the
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
first scene: but the native spirits of Camilla revisited
her in the view of the ludicrous personages of the dra∣ma.
And they were soon joined by Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel,
whose quaint conceits and remarks assisted the
risibility of the scene. She thought him the least com∣prehensible
person she had ever known; but he was
totally indifferent to her, his oddity entertained without
tormenting her.</P>
<P>The actors were of the lowest strolling kind, and so
utterly without merit, that they had never yet met with
sufficient encouragement to remain one week in the
same place. They had only a single scene for the whole
performance, which depictured a camp, and which here
served for a street, a senate, a city, a castle, and a bed∣chamber.</P>
<P>The dresses were almost equally parsimonious, every
one being obliged to take what would fit him, from a
wardrobe that did not allow quite two dresses a person
for all the plays they had to enact. Othello, there∣fore,
was equipped as king Richard the third, save that
instead of a regal front he had a black wig, to imitate
wool: while his face had been begrimed with a smoked
cork.</P>
<P>Iago wore a suit of cloaths originally made for Lord
Foppington: Brabantio had borrowed the armour of
Hamlet's Ghost: Cassio, the Lieutenant General in
the christian army, had only been able to equip himself
in Osmyn's Turkish vest; and Roderigo, accoutred in
the garment of Shylock, came forth a complete Jew.</P>
<P>Desdemona, attired more suitably to her fate than
to her expectations, went through the whole of her
part, except the last scene, in the sable weeds of Isabella.
And Amelia was fain to content herself with the ha∣bit
of the first witch in Macbeth.</P>
<P>The gestures, both of the gentlemen and ladies, were
as outrageous as if meant rather to intimidate the au∣dience,
than to shew their own animation; and the men
approached each other so closely with arms a-kimbo, or
double fists, that Sir Sedley, with pretended alarm,
said they were giving challenges for a boxing match.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
The ladies also, in the energy of their desire not be
eclipsed, took so much exercise in their action, that
they tore out the sleeves of their gowns; which, though
pinned up every time they left the stage, completely
exposed their shoulders at the end of every act; and
they raised their arms so high while facing each other,
that Sir Sedley expressed frequent fears they meant to
finish by pulling caps.</P>
<P>So imperfect were they also in their parts, that the
prompter was the only person from whom any single
speech passed without a blunder.</P>
<P>Iago, who was the master of the troop, was the sole
performer who spoke not with a provincial dialect: the
rest all betrayed their birth and parentage the first line
they uttered.</P>
<Q><L>Cassio proclaimed himself from Norfolk:</L>
<L>The Deuk dew greet yew, General,</L>
<L>—</L>
<L>Being not at yew're lodging to be feund—</L>
<L>The senate sent above tree several quests, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Othello himself proved a true Londoner; and with
his famed soldier-like eloquence in the senate-scene, thus
began his celebrated defence.</P>
<Q><L>Most potent, grawe, and rewerend Seignors,</L>
<L>My wery noble and approwed good masters,</L>
<L>That I have ta'en avay this old man's darter—</L>
<L>I vill a round, unwarnished tale deliver</L>
<L>Of my whole course of love; vhat drugs, vhat
charms,</L>
<L>Vhat conjuration, and vhat mighty magic</L>
<L>I von his darter vith—</L>
<L>Her father lov'd me, oft inwited me—</L>
<L>—My story being done,</L>
<L>She gave me for my pains a vorld of sighs,</L>
<L>She svore in faith 'tvas strange, 'tvas passing strange,</L>
<L>'Tvas pitiful, 't'vas vondrous pitiful;</L>
<L>She vish'd she had not heard it; yet she vish'd</L>
<L>That Heawen had made her such a man.—</L>
<L>This only is the vitchraft I have us'd;</L>
<L>Here comes the lady, let her vitness it.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
This happily making the gentle Desdemona recog∣nised,
notwithstanding her appearance was so little
bridal, her Somersetshire father cried:
<Q><L>I preay you her 'ur zpeak.</L>
<L>If a confez that a waz half the woer</L>
<L>Deztruction on my head, if my bead bleame</L>
<L>Light o' the mon!</L></Q></P>
<P>His daughter, in the Worcestershire pronunciation,
answered:
<Q><L>Noble father,</L>
<L>Hi do perceive ere a divided duty;</L>
<L>To you hi howe my life hand heducation,</L>
<L>My life hand heducation both do teach me</L>
<L>Ow to respect you. You're the lord hof duty;</L>
<L>Hi'm itherto your daughter: but ere's my us∣band!
—</L>
<L>The fond Othello then exclaimed:</L>
<L>Your woices, lords! beseech you let her vill</L>
<L>Have a free vay!—</L>
<L>And Brabantio took leave with</L>
<L>Look to'ur, Moor! if th' azt eyez to zee;</L>
<L>A haz deceiv'd 'ur veather, and may thee.—</L></Q></P>
<P>They were detained so long between the first and
second act, that Sir Sedley said he feared poor Desde∣mona
had lost the thread-paper from which she was to
mend her gown, and recommended to the two young
ladies to have the charity to go and assist her. “Con∣sider,”
he said, “the trepidation of a fair bride but just
entered into her shackles. Who knows but Othello
may be giving her a strapping, in private, for wearing
out her cloaths so fast! you young ladies think nothing
of these little conjugal freedoms.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, though for some time she had been as
well diverted by the play as Camilla, less new to such
exhibitions, was soon tired of the sameness of the blun∣ders,
and, at the end of the fourth act, proposed retir∣ing.
But Camilla, who had long not felt so much en∣tertained,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
looked so disappointed, that her good humour
overcame her fatigue, and she was insisting upon stay∣ing;
when a gentleman, who visited them from the
opposite box, proposed that the young ladies should be
carried home by his mother, a lady who lived at Ether∣ington,
and was acquainted at the rectory, and who
intended to stay out not only the play but the farce.
Lavinia consented; the son went with the proposition,
and business was soon arranged. Mrs. Arlbery, who
had three miles to go beyond the parsonage-house, and
who, though she delighted to oblige, was but little in
the habit of practising self-denial, then consigned the
young ladies to General Kinsale, to be conducted to the
opposite box, and was handed by Colonel Handover to
her coach.</P>
<P>The General guarded the eldest sister; the Major
took care of Camilla: but they were all stopt in their
passage by the sudden seizure of a pickpocket, and
forced hastily back to the box they had quitted.</P>
<P>This commotion, though it had disturbed all the
audience, had not stopt the performance; and Desde∣mona
being just now discovered in bed, Camilla, not
to lose the interesting scene, persuaded her sister to wait
till the play was over, before they attempted again to
cross to the opposite box; into which, in a few minutes
after, she saw Mandlebert enter.</P>
<P>They had both already seated themselves as much
out of sight as possible; and Camilla now began to re∣gret
she had not accompanied Mrs. Arlbery. She had
thought only of the play and its entertainment, till the
sight of Mandlebert told her that her situation was im∣proper:
and the idea only occurred to her by consider∣ing
that it would occur to him.</P>
<P>Mandlebert had dined out with a party of men, and
had stept in to see what was going forwards, without
any knowledge whom he should meet: he instantly
discerned Lavinia, and felt anxious to know why Ca∣milla
was not with her, and why she sat so much out of
sight: but Camilla so completely hid herself, he could
only see there was a female, whom he concluded to be
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
some Etherington lady; and he determined to make
further enquiry when the act should be over.</P>
<P>The performance now became so truly ludicrous, that
Camilla, notwithstanding all her uneasiness, was excit∣ed
to almost perpetual laughter.</P>
<P>Desdemona, either from the effects of a bad cold, or
to give more of nature to her repose, breathed so hard,
as to raise a general laugh in the audience; Sir Sedley,
stopping his ears, exclaimed, “O! if she snores I
shall plead for her no more, if she tear her gown to
tatters! Suffocation is much too lenient for her. She's
an immense horrid personage! nasal to alarm!”</P>
<P>Othello then entered, with a tallow candle in his
hand, staring and dropping grease at every step; and,
having just declared he would not
<Q>Scar that vhiter skin of hers than snow,</Q>
perceived a thief in the candle, which made it run
down so fast over his hand, and the sleeves of his coat,
that, the moment not being yet arrived for extinguish∣ing
it, he was forced to lay down his sword, and, for
want of better means, snuff it with his fingers.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley now protested himself completely disor∣dered:
“I must be gone,” cried he, “incontinently;
this exceeds resistance: I shan't be alive in another mi∣nute.
Are you able to form a notion of any thing more
annihilating? If I did not build upon the pleasure of
seeing him stop up those distressing nostrils of the gen∣tle
Desdemona, I could not breathe here another in∣stant.”</P>
<P>But just after, while Othello leant over the bed to
say—
<Q><L>“Vhen I've pluck'd the rose</L>
<L>I cannot give it wital growth again,</L>
<L>It needs must vither”—</L></Q>
his black locks caught fire.</P>
<P>The candle now fell from his hand, and he attempted
to pull of his wig; but it had been tied close on, to
appear more natural, and his fright disabled him; he
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
therefore flung himself upon the bed, and rolled the
coverlid over his head.</P>
<P>Desdemona, excessively frightened, started up, and
jumped out, shrieking aloud—“O Lord! I shall be
burnt!”</P>
<P>This noble Venetian Dame then exhibited, beneath
an old white satin bed gown, made to cover her arms
and breast, the dress in which she had equipped herself,
between the acts, to be ready for trampling home;
namely, a dirty red and white linen gown, an old blue
stuff quilted coat, and black shoes and stockings.</P>
<P>In this pitiable condition, she was running, scream∣ing,
off the stage, when Othello, having quenched the
fire, unconscious that half his curls had fallen a sacri∣fice
to the flames, hastily pursued her, and, in a violent
passion, called her a fool, and brought her back to the
bed; in which he assisted her to compose herself, and
then went behind the scenes to light his candle; which
having done, he gravely returned, and, very carefully
putting it down, renewed his part with the line.</P>
<P>“Be thus vhen thou art dead, and I vill kill thee. And
love thee after—”</P>
<P>Amidst roars of laughter from the whole audience,
who, when he kissed her, almost with one voice call∣ed
out—“Ay ay, that's right—kiss and friends!”</P>
<P>And when he said—
<Q>“I must veep”—</Q>
“So must I too, my good friend,” cried Sir Sedley,
wiping his eyes, “for never yet did sorrow cost me
more salt rheum! Poor Blacky! thou hast been most
indissolubly comic, I confess. Thou hast unstrung me
to a degree. A baby of half an hour might demolish
me.”</P>
<P>And again, when Othello exclaimed—
<Q>“She vakes!”</Q>
“The deuce she does?” cried Sir Sedley, “what! has
she been asleep again already? She's a very caricatura
of Morpheus. Ay, do thy worst, honest Mungo. I
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
can't possibly beg her off. I would sooner snift thy
farthing candle once a day, than sustain that nasal ca∣dence
ever more.”</P>
<P>“He's the finest fellow upon the face of the earth,”
cried Mr. Macdersey, who had listened to the whole
play with the most serious interest; “the instant he
suspects his wife, he cuts her off without ceremony;
though she's dearer to him than his eye sight, and beau∣tiful
as an angel. How I envy him!”</P>
<P>“Don't you think 'twould have been as well,” said
General Kinsale, “if he'd first made some little en∣quiry?”</P>
<P>“He can do that afterwards, General; and then no∣body
will dare surmise it's out of weakness. For to be
sure and certain, he ought to right her fame; that's no
more than his duty, after once he has satisfied his own.
But a man's honour is dearest to him of all things. A
wife's a bauble to it—not worth a thought.”</P>
<P>The suffocating was now beginning; but just as Des∣demona
begged to be spared—
<Q>“But alf han our”—</Q>
the door-keeper forced his way into the pit, and called
out—“Pray, is one Miss Tyrold here in the play∣house?”</P>
<P>The sisters, in much amazement hung back, entreat∣ing
the Gentlemen to screen them; and the man, re∣ceiving
no answer went away.</P>
<P>While wondering what this could mean, the play was
finished, when one of the comedians, a brother of the
Worcestershire Desdemona, came to the pit door, call∣ing
out—“Hi'm desired to hask hif Miss Camilla Ty∣rold's
hany way ere hin the ouse, for hi'm hordered
to call er hout, for her Huncle's hill and dying.”</P>
<P>A piercing shriek from Camilla now completed the
interruption of all attention to the performance, and be∣trayed
her hiding place. Concealment, indeed, was
banished her thoughts, and she would herself have open∣ed
the box door to rush out, had not the Major anti∣cipated
her, seizing, at the same-time, her hand to con∣duct
her through the crowd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Three Golden Maxims.</HEAD>
<P>LAVINIA, almost equally terrified, followed her sis∣ter;
and Sir Sedley, burying all foppery in compassion
and good nature, was foremost to accompany and assist.
Camilla had no thought but to get instantly to Cleves;
she considered not how; she only forced herself rapidly
on, persuaded she could walk it in ten minutes, and eja∣culating
incessantly, “My Uncle!—my dear Un∣cle!”
—</P>
<P>They almost instantly encountered Edgar, who, up∣on
the fatal call, had darted round to meet them, and
finding each provided with an attendant, inquired whose
carriage he should seek?</P>
<P>Camilla, in a broken voice, answered she had no car∣riage,
and should walk.</P>
<P>“Walk?” he repeated; you are near five miles from
Cleves!”</P>
<P>Scarce in her senses, she hurried on without reply.</P>
<P>“What carriage did you come in, Miss Tyrold?”
said Edgar to Lavinia.</P>
<P>“We came with Mrs. Albery.”</P>
<P>“Mrs. Arlbery?—she has been gone this half hour;
I met her as I entered.”</P>
<P>Camilla had now rushed out of doors, still handed by
the Major.</P>
<P>“If you have no carriage in waiting,” said Edgar,
“make use, I beseech, you, of mine!”</P>
<P>“O, gladly! O, thankfully!” cried Camilla, almost
sobbing out her words.</P>
<P>He flew then to call for his chaise, and the door
keeper, for whom Sir Sedley had inquired, came to
them accompanied by Jacob.</P>
<P>“O, Jacob!” she cried, breaking violently from the
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Major, “tell me!—tell me!—my Uncle!—my dearest
Uncle!”</P>
<P>Jacob, in a tone of deep and unfeigned sorrow, said,
his Master had been seized suddenly with the gout in
his stomach, and that the doctor, who had been instant∣ly
fetched, had owned there was little hope.</P>
<P>She could hear no more; the shock overpowered her,
and she funk nearly senseless into the arms of her sis∣ter.</P>
<P>She was recovered, however, almost in a minute, and
carried by Edgar into his chaise, in which he placed her
between himself and the weeping Lavinia; hastily tel∣ling
the two gentlemen, that his intimate connection
with the family authorized his assisting and attending
them at such a period.</P>
<P>This was too well known to be disputed; and Sir
Sedley and the Major, with great concern, uttered their
good wishes and retreated.</P>
<P>Jacob had already been for Mr. Tyrold, who had set
off instantaneously on horseback.</P>
<P>Camilla spoke not a word the first mile, which was
spent in an hysteric sobbing: but, recovering a little af∣terwards,
and sinking on the shoulder of her sister,
“O, Lavinia!” she cried, “should we lose my Un∣cle
—”</P>
<P>A shower of tears wetted the neck of Lavinia,
who mingled with them her own, though less violently,
from having less connection with Sir Hugh, and a sen∣sibility
less ungovernable.</P>
<P>She called herself upon the postillion to drive faster,
and pressed Edgar continually to hurry him; but though
he gave every charge she could desire, so much swifter
were her wishes than any possible speed, that twenty
times she entreated to get out, believing she could walk
quicker than the horses galloped.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the park gate, she was with
difficulty held back from opening the chaise door; and
when, at length, they stopt at the house porch, she could
not wait for the step, and before Edgar could either pre∣cede
or prevent her, threw herself into the arms of Ja∣cob,
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
who having just dismounted, was fortunately at
hand to save her from falling.</P>
<P>She stopt not to ask any question; “My Uncle!—
my Uncle!” she cried, impetuously, and, rushing past all
she met, was in his room in a moment.</P>
<P>Edgar, though he could not obstruct, followed her
close, dreading lest Sir Hugh might already be no
more, and determined, in that case, to force her from
the fatal spot.</P>
<P>Eugenia, who heard her footstep, received her at the
door, but took her immediately from the room, softly
whispering, while her arms were thrown round her
waist—“He will live! he will live, my sister! his ago∣nies
are over—he is fallen asleep, and he will live!”</P>
<P>This was too sudden a joy for the desponding Ca∣milla,
whose breath instantly stopt, and who must have
fallen upon the floor, had she not been caught by Ed∣gar;
who, though his own eyes copiously overflowed
with delight, at such unexpected good news of the uni∣versally
beloved Baronet, had stength and exertion suf∣ficient
to carry her down stairs into the parlour, accom∣panied
by Eugenia.</P>
<P>There, hartshorn and water presently revived her,
and then, regardless of the presence of Edgar, she cast
herself upon her knees, to utter a fervent thanksgiving,
in which Eugenia, with equal piety, though more com∣posure,
joined.</P>
<P>Edgar had never yet beheld her in a light so resplen∣dent
—What a heart, thought he, is here! what feelings,
what tenderness, what animation!—O, what a heart!
—were it possible to touch it!”</P>
<P>The two sisters went both gently up stairs, encou∣raging
and congratulating each other in soft whispers,
and stationed themselves in an anti-room: Mr. Tyrold,
by medical counsel, giving directions that no one but
himself should enter the sick chamber.</P>
<P>Edgar, though he only saw the domestics, could not
persuade himself to leave the house till near two o'clock
in the morning: and by six, his anxiety brought him
thither again. He then heard, that the Baronet had
passed a night of more pain than danger, the gout hav∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
been expelled his stomach, though it had been threat∣ening
almost every other part.</P>
<P>Three days and nights passed in this manner; during
which, Edgar saw so much of the tender affections, and
softer character of Camilla, that nothing could have with∣held
him from manifesting his entire sympathy in her
feelings, but the unaccountable circumstance of her start∣ing
forth from a back feat at the play, where she had sat
concealed, attended by the Major, and without any ma∣tron
protectress.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, meanwhile, scowled at him, and In∣diana
pouted in vain. His earnest solicitude for Sir
Hugh surmounted every such obstacle to his present vi∣sits
at Cleves; and he spent there almost the whole of
his time.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of the attack, Sir Hugh had a
sleep of five hour's continuance, from which he awoke
so much revived, that he raised himself in his bed, and
called out—“My dear Brother! you are still here?—
you are very good to me, indeed; poor sinner that I
am! to forgive me for all my bad behaviour to your
Children.”</P>
<P>“My dearest Brother! my Children, like myself,
owe you nothing but kindness and beneficence; and
like myself, feel for you nothing but gratitude and ten∣derness.”</P>
<P>“They are very good, very good indeed,” said Sir
Hugh, with a deep sigh; “but Eugenia!—poor little
Eugenia has nearly been the death of me; though not
meaning it in the least, being all her life as innocent as
a lamb.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold assured him, that Eugenia was attached
to him with the most unalterable fondness. But Sir
Hugh said, that the sight of her, returning from Ether∣ington,
with nearly the same sadness as ever, had wound∣ed
him to the heart, by shewing him she would never
recover; which had brought back upon him all his first
contrition, about the small-pox, and the fall from the
plank, and had caused his conscience to give him so ma∣ny
twiches, that it never let him rest a moment, till the
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
gout seized upon his stomach, and almost took him off
at once.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold attributed solely to his own strong ima∣gination
the idea of the continuance of the dejection of
Eugenia, as she had left Etherington calm, and almost
chearful. He instantly, therefore, fetched her, inti∣mating
the species of consolation she could afford.</P>
<P>“Kindest of Uneles!” cried she, “is it possible you
can ever, for a moment, have doubted the grateful af∣fection
with which your goodness has impressed me
from my childhood? Do me more justice, I beseech you,
my dearest Uncle! recover from this terrible at∣tack,
and you shall soon see your Eugenia restored to all
the happiness you can wish her.”</P>
<P>“Nobody has got such kind nieces as me!” cried Sir
Hugh, again dissolving into tenderness; “for all nobody
has deserved so ill of them. My generous little Ca∣milla,
forgave me from the very first, before her young
soul had any guile in it, which, God knows, it never
has had to this hour, no more than your own. How∣ever,
this I can tell you, which may serve to keep you
from repenting being good, and that is, that your kind∣ness
to your poor Uncle may be the means of saving a
christian's life; which, for a young person at your age,
is as much as can be expected: for I think, I may yet
get about again, if I could once be assured I should see
you as happy as you used to be; and you've been the
contentedest little thing, till those unlucky market-wo∣men,
that ever was seen: always speaking up for the ser∣vants,
and the poor, from the time you were eight years
old. And never letting me be angry, but taking every
body's part, and thinking them all as good as yourself,
and only wanting to make them as happy.”</P>
<P>“Ah, my dear Uncle! how kind a memory is
your's! retaining only what can give pleasure, and
burying in oblivion whatever might cause pain!—”</P>
<P>“Is my Uncle well enough to speak?” cried Ca∣milla,
softly opening the door, “and may I—for one
single moment,—see him?”—</P>
<P>“That's the voice of my dear Camilla!” said Sir
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Hugh; “come in, my little love for I sha'n't shock your
tender heart now, for I'm going to get better.”</P>
<P>Camilla, in an extacy, was instantly at his bed-side,
passionately exclaiming, “My dear, dear Uncle! will
you indeed recover?—”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, throwing his feeble arms round her neck,
and leaning his head upon her shoulder, could only
faintly articulate, “If God pleases, I shall, my little
darling, my heart's delight and joy! But don't vex,
whether I do or not, for it is but in the course of na∣ture
for a man to die, even in his youth; but how much
more when he comes to be old? Though I know you
can't help missing me, in particular at the first, because
of all your goodness to me</P>
<P>“Missing you? O my Uncle! we can never be happy
again without you! never never!—when your loved
countenance no longer smiles upon us,—when your
kind voice no longer assembles us around you!—”</P>
<P>“My dear child—my own little Camilla,” cried Sir
Hugh, in a faint voice, “I am ready to die!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold here forced her away, and his brother
grew so much worse, that a dangerous relapse took
place, and for three days more, the physician, the nurse,
and Mr. Tyrold, were alone allowed to enter his room.</P>
<P>During this time, the whole family suffered the truest
grief, and Camilla was inconsolable.</P>
<P>When again he began to revive, he called Mr. Ty∣rold
to him, and said that this second shake persuaded
him he had but a short time more for this world; and
begged therefore he would prepare him for his exit.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold complied, and found, with more happi∣ness
than surprise, his perfect and chearful resignation
either to live or to die, rejoicing as much as himself, in
the innocent benevolence of his past days.</P>
<P>Composed and strengthened by religious duties, he
then desired to see Eugenia and Indiana, that he might
give them his last exhortations and counsel, in case of a
speedy end.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would fain have spared him this touch∣ing
exertion, but he declared he could not go off with a
clear conscience, unless he told them the advice which
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
he had been thinking of for them, between whiles, du∣ring
all his illness.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold then feared that opposition might but
discompose him, and summoned his youngest daughter
and his niece, charging them both to repress their af∣fliction,
lest it should accelerate what they mostly dread∣ed.</P>
<P>Camilla, always upon the watch, glided in with
them, supplicating her Father not to deny her admit∣tance;
though fearful of her impetuous sorrows, he
wished her to retreat; but Sir Hugh no sooner heard
her murmuring voice, than he declared he would have
her refused nothing, though he had meant to take a par∣ticular
leave of her alone, for the last thing of all.</P>
<P>Gratefully thanking him, she advanced trembling to
his bed-side; solemnly promising her Father that no ex∣pression
of her grief should again risk agitating a life and
health so precious.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then desired to have Lavinia called also,
because, though he had thought of nothing to say to
her, she might be hurt, after he was gone, in being left
out.</P>
<P>He was then raised by pillows and sat upright, and
they knelt round his bed. Mr. Tyrold entreated him to
be concise, and insisted upon the extremest forbearance
and fortitude in his little audience. He seated himself
at some distance, and Sir Hugh, after swallowing a cor∣dial
medicine, began:</P>
<P>“My dear Nieces, I have sent for you all upon a par∣ticular
account, which I beg you to listen to, because,
God only knows whether I may ever be able to give you
so much advice again. I see you all look very melan∣choly,
which I take very kind of you. However don't
cry, my little dears, for we must all go off, so it mat∣ters
but little the day or the hour; dying being, besides,
the greatest comfort of us all, taking us off from our
cares; as my Brother will explain to you better than
me.</P>
<P>“The chief of what I have got to say,” in regard to
what I have been studying in my illness, is for you two,
my dear Eugenia and Indiana; because, having brought”
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
you both up, I can't get it out of my head what you'll
do, when I am no longer here to keep you out of the
danger of bad designers.</P>
<P>“My hope had been to have seen you both married
while I was alive and amongst you, and I made as
many plans as my poor head knew how, to bring it
about; but we've all been disappointed alike, for which
reason we must put up with it properly.”</P>
<P>“What I have now last of all, to say to you, my
little dears, is three maxims, which may serve for
you all four alike, though I thought of them, at first,
only for you too.”</P>
<P>“In the first place, <HI>Never be proud:</HI> if you are,
your superiors will laugh at you, your equals won't
love you, and your dependants will hate you. And
what is there for poor mortal man to be proud of?—
Riches!—why they are but a charge, and if we
don't use them well, we may envy the poor beggar
that has so much less to answer for.—Beauty?—
why, we can neither get it when we have n't it; nor
keep it when we have it.—Power!—why we scarce
ever use it one way, but what we are sorry we did not
use it another!”</P>
<P>“In the second place, <HI>Never trust a Flatterer.</HI> If
a man makes you a great many compliments, always
suspect him of some bad design, and never believe
him your friend, till he tells you of some of your
faults. Poor little things! you little imagine how
many you have, for all you're so good!”</P>
<P>“In the third place, <HI>Do no harm to others, for the
sake of any good it may do to yourselves;</HI> because the
good will last you but a little while; and the repen∣tance
will stick by you as long as you live; and
what is worse, a great while longer, and beyond any
count the best Almanack-maker knows how to rec∣kon.”</P>
<P>“And now, my dear Nieces, this is all; except
the recommending to my dear Eugenia to be kind to
my poor servants, who have all used me so well,
knowing I have nothing to leave them.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, suppressing her sobs, promised to retain
them all, as long as they should desire to remain with
her, and to provide for them afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
“I know you'll forget nobody, my dear little
girl,” cried the Baronet, “which makes me die con∣tented;
not even Mrs. Margland, a little particularity
not being to be considered at one's last end: and much
less Dr. Orkborne, who has so much a better right
from you. As to Indiana, she'll have her own little
fortune when she comes of age; and I dare say her
pretty face will marry her before long.—And as to
Clermont, he'll come off rather short, finding I leave
him nothing; but you'll make up for the deficiency,
by giving him the whole, as well as a good wife. As
to Lionel, I leave him my blessing; and as to any
other legacy I never happened to promise him any;
which is very good luck for me, as well as my best
excuse; and I may say the same to my dear Lavinia,
which is the reason I called her in, because she may
not often have an opportunity to hear a man speak
upon his death bed. However all I wish for is, that
I could leave you all equal shares, as well as give Eu∣genia
the whole.”</P>
<P>“O my dear Uncle!” exclaimed Eugenia, “make
a new Will immediately! do every thing your tender∣ness
can dictate!—or tell me what I shall do in your
name, and every word, every wish shall be sacredly
obeyed!”</P>
<P>“Dear, generous, noble girl! no! I won't take
from you a shilling! keep it all—nobody will spend it
so well;—and I can't give you back your beauty; so
keep it, my dear, all, for my oath's sake, when I
am gone; and don't make me die under a prevaricat∣ing;
which would be but a grievous thing for a person
to do; unless he was but a bad believer: which, God
help us! there are enough, without my helping to
make more.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now again remonstrated, motioning to
the weeping group to be gone.</P>
<P>“Ah! my dear Brother!” said Sir Hugh, “you are
the only right person that ought to have had it all, if it
had not been for my poor weak brain, that made me
always be looking askew, instead of strait forward.
And indeed I always meant you to have had it for your
life, till the small <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox put all things out of my head.
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
However, I hope you won't object to preach my fune∣ral
sermon, for all my bad faults, for nobody else will
speak of me so kindly; which may serve as a better
lesson for those I leave behind.”</P>
<P>Tears flowed fast down the cheeks of Mr. Tyrold,
as he uttered whatever he could suggest most tenderly
soothing to his Brother: and the young mourners,
not daring to resist, were all gliding away, except
Camilla, whose hand was fast grasped in that of her
Uncle.</P>
<P>“Ah, my Camilla,” cried he, as she would gently
have withdrawn it, “how shall I part with my little
dear darling? this is the worst twitch to me of all,
with all my contentedness! And the more because I
know you love your poor old Uncle, just as well as if
he had left you all he was worth, though you won't
get one penny by his death!”</P>
<P>“O my dear, dearest Uncle—” exclaimed Camilla,
in a passionate flood of tears; when Mr. Tyrold, as∣suring
them both the consequences might be fatal, tore
her away from the bed and the room.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Pursuer.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the fears so justly ex∣cited
from the mixt emotions and exertions of Sir
Hugh, Mr. Tyrold had the happiness to see him fall
into a tranquil sleep, from which he awoke without
any return of pain; his night was quiet; the next
day was still better; and the day following he was
pronounced out of danger.</P>
<P>The rapture which this declaration excited in the
house, and diffused throughout the neighbourhood,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
when communicated to the worthy baronet, gave a
gladness to his heart that recompensed all he had suf∣fered.</P>
<P>The delight of Camilla exceeded whatever she had
yet experienced: her life had lost half its value in her
estimation, while she believed that of her uncle to be
in danger.</P>
<P>No one single quality is perhaps so endearing, from
man to man, as good-nature. Talents excite more
admiration; wisdom, more respect; and virtue, more
esteem; but with admiration envy is apt to mingle,
and fear with respect; while esteem, though always
honourable, is often cold; but good-nature gives
pleasure without any allay; ease, confidence, and
happy carelessness, without the pain of obligation,
without the exertion of gratitude.</P>
<P>If joy was in some more tumultuous, content was
with none so penetrating as with Eugenia. Apprised
now that she had been the immediate cause of the suf∣ferings
of her uncle, his loss would have given to her
peace a blow irrecoverable; and she determined to
bend the whole of her thoughts to his wishes, his com∣fort,
his entire restoration.</P>
<P>To this end all her virtue was called in aid; a fear,
next to aversion, having seized her of Clermont, from
the apprehension she might never inspire in him such
love as she had inspired in Bellamy, nor see in him, as
in young Melmond, such merit as might raise similar
sentiments for himself.</P>
<P>Molly Mill had not failed to paint to her the disap∣pointment
of Bellamy in not seeing her; but she was
too much engrossed by the dangerous state of her uncle,
to feel any compunction in her breach of promise;
though touched with the account of his continual suf∣ferings,
she became very gentle in her reprimands to
Molly for again meeting him; and, though Molly
again disobeyed, she again was pardoned. He came
daily to the lane behind the park pales, to hear news
of the health of Sir Hugh, without pressing either for
an interview or a letter; and Eugenia grew more and
more moved by his respectful obsequiousness. She had
yet said nothing to Camilla upon the subject; not only
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
because a dearer interest mutually occupied them, but
from a secret shame of naming a lover at a period so
ungenial.</P>
<P>But now that Sir Hugh was in a fair way of reco∣very,
her situation became alarming to herself.—
Openly, and before the whole house, she had solemnly
been assigned to Clermont Lynmere; and, little as she
wished the connexion, she thought it, from circum∣stances,
her duty not to refuse it. Yet this gentleman
had attended her so long, had endured so many disap∣pointments,
and borne them so much to her satisfaction,
that, though she lamented her concession as an injury
to Clermont, and grew ashamed to name it even to
Camilla, she believed it would be cruelty unheard of
to break it. She determined, therefore, to see him,
to pronounce a farewell, and then to bend all her
thoughts to the partner destined her by her friends.</P>
<P>Molly Mill was alone to accompany her to give her
negative, her good wishes, and her solemn declaration
that she could never again see or hear of him more.
He could deem it no indelicacy that she suffered Molly
to be present, since she was the negociator of his own
choice.</P>
<P>Molly carried him, therefore, this news, with a
previous condition that he was not to detain her mistress
one minute. He promised all submission; and the
next morning, after breakfast, Eugenia, in extreme
dejection at the ungrateful task she had to perform,
called for Molly, and walked forth.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was then accidentally in her own
room, was, soon after, summoned by three smart raps
to her chamber door.</P>
<P>Where, to her great surprise, she saw Edgar, who,
after a hasty apology, begged to have a few minutes
conference with her alone.</P>
<P>She descended with him into the parlour, which was
vacant.</P>
<P>“You suspect, perhaps,” said he, in an hurried
manner, though attempting to smile, “that I mean
to fatigue you with some troublesome advice; I must,
therefore, by an abrupt question, explain myself.
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Does Mr. Bellamy still continue his pretensions to
your sister Eugenia?”</P>
<P>Startled in a moment from all thoughts of self, that
at first had been rushing with violence to her heart,
Camilla answered, “No! why do you ask?”</P>
<P>“I will tell you: In my regular visits here of late,
I have almost constantly met him, either on foot or on
horseback, in the vicinity of the park. I suspected he
watched to see Eugenia; but I knew she now never
left the house; and concluded he was ignorant of the
late general confinement. This moment, however,
upon my entrance, I saw him again; and, as he hastily
turned away upon meeting my eye, I dismounted,
gave my horse to my man, and determined to satisfy
myself which way he was strolling. I then followed
him to the little lane to the right of the park, where I
perceived an empty post-chaise-and-sour in waiting:
he advanced, and spoke with the postillion—I came
instantly into the house by the little gate. This may
be accidental; yet it has alarmed me; and I ventured,
therefore, thus suddenly to apply to you, in order to
urge you to give a caution to Eugenia, not to walk
out, just at present, unattended.”</P>
<P>Camilla thanked him, and ran eagerly to speak to
her sister; but she was not in her room; nor was she
with her uncle; nor yet with Dr. Orkborne. She
returned uneasily to the parlour, and said she would
seek her in the park.</P>
<P>Edgar followed; but they looked around for her
in vain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he then, deeming the danger urgent, left
her, to hasten <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the spot where he had seen the post∣chaise.</P>
<P>Camilla ran on alone; and, when she reached the
park gate, perceived her sister, Molly Mill, and
Bellamy, in the lane.</P>
<P>They heard her quick approach, and turned
round.</P>
<P>The countenance of Bellamy exhibited the darkest
disappointment, and that of Eugenia the most exces∣sive
confusion. “Now then, Sir,” she cried, “delay
our separation no longer.”</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
“Ah, permit me,” said he, in a low voice, “per∣mit
me to hope you will hear my last sad sentence, my
final misery, another day!—I will defer my mournful
departure for the melancholy joy, which is the last I
shall feel in my wretched existence!”</P>
<P>He sighed so deeply, that Eugenia, who seemed
already in much sorrow, could not utter an abrupt re∣fusal;
and, as Camilla now advanced, she turned
from him, without attempting to say any thing further.</P>
<P>Camilla, in the delight of finding her sister safe,
after the horrible apprehensions she had just experienc∣ed,
could not speak to her for tears.</P>
<P>Abashed at once, and amazed, Eugenia faintly as∣ked
what so affected her? She gave no explanation,
but begged her to turn immediately back.</P>
<P>Eugenia consented; and Bellamy, bowing to them
both profoundly, with quick steps walked away.</P>
<P>Camilla asked a thousand questions; but Eugenia
seemed unable to answer them.</P>
<P>In a few minutes they were joined by Edgar, who,
walking hastily up to them, took Camilla apart.</P>
<P>He told her he firmly believed a villainous scheme
to have been laid: he had found the chaise still in
waiting, and asked the postillion to whom he belonged.
The man said he was paid for what he did; and refused
giving any account of himself. Bellamy then appear∣ed;
he seemed confounded at his fight; but neither of
them spoke; and he left him and his chaise, and his
postillion, to console one another. He doubted not,
he said, but the design had been to carry Eugenia off,
and he had probably only pretended to take leave, that
the chaise might advance, and the postillion aid the
elopement: though finding help at hand, he had been
forced to give up his scheme.</P>
<P>Camilla even with rapture blest his fortunate pre∣sence;
but was confounded with perplexity at the con∣duct
of Eugenia. Edgar, who feared her heart was
entangled by an object who sought only her wealth,
proposed dismissing Molly Mill, that he might tell
her himself the opinion he had conceived of Bellamy.</P>
<P>Camilla overtook her sister, who had walked on with∣out
listening to or regarding them; and sending away
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Molly, told her Edgar wished immediately to converse
with her, upon something of the utmost importance.</P>
<P>“You know my high esteem of him,” she answer∣ed;
“but my mind is now occupied upon a business
of which he has no information, and I entreat that you
will neither of you interrupt me.”</P>
<P>Camilla, utterly at a loss what to conjecture, joined
Mandlebert alone, and told him her ill success. He
thought every thing was to be feared from the present
state of the affair, and proposed revealing at once all
he knew of it to Mr. Tyrold: but Camilla desired him
to take no step till she had again expostulated with her
sister, who might else be seriously hurt or offended.
He complied, and said he would continue in the house,
park, or environs, incessantly upon the watch till
some decisive measure were adopted.</P>
<P>Joining Eugenia then again, she asked if she meant
seriously to encourage the addresses of Bellamy.</P>
<P>“By no means,” she quietly answered.</P>
<P>“My dear Eugenia, I cannot at all understand you;
but it seems clear to me that the arrival of Edgar has
saved you from some dreadful violence.”</P>
<P>“You hurt me Camilla, by this prejudice. From
whom should I dread violence? from a man who—but
too fatally for his peace—values me more than his
life?”</P>
<P>“If I could be sure of his sincerity,” said Camilla,
“I should be the last to think ill of him: but reflect
a little, at least, upon the risk that you have run; my
dear Eugenia! there was a post-chaise in waiting,
not twenty yards from where I stopt you!”</P>
<P>“Ah, you little know Bellamy! that chaise was
only to convey him away; to convey him Camilla to
an eternal banishment.!”</P>
<P>“But why, then, had he prevailed with you to quit
the park?”</P>
<P>“You will call me vain if I tell you.”</P>
<P>“No; I shall only think you kind and confiden∣tial.”</P>
<P>“Do me then the justice,” said Eugenia, blushing,
to believe me as much surprised as yourself at his most
unmerited passion: but he told me, that if I only cast
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
my eyes upon the vehicle which was to part him from
me for ever, it would not only make it less abhorrent
to him, but probably prevent the loss of his senses.”</P>
<P>“My dear Eugenia,” said Camilla, half smiling,
“this is a violent passion, indeed for so short an ac∣quaintance!”</P>
<P>“I knew you would say that,” answered she, dis∣concerted;
“and it was just what I observed to him
myself: but he satisfied me that the reason of his feel∣ings
being so impetuous was, that this was the first and
only time he had ever been in love—So handsome as
he is!—what a choice for him to make!”</P>
<P>Camilla, tenderly embracing her, declared, “the
choice was all that did him honour in the affair.”</P>
<P>“He never,” said she, a little comforted, “makes
me any compliments; I should else disregard, if not
disdain him: but indeed he seems notwithstanding his
own extraordinary manly beauty, to be wholly supe∣rior
to external considerations.”</P>
<P>Camilla now forbore expressing farther doubt, from
the fear of painful misapprehension; but earnestly en∣treated
her to suffer Edgar to be entrusted and consult∣ed:
she decidely, however, refused her consent. “I
require no advice,” cried she, “for I am devoted to
my uncle's will: to speak then of this affair would be
the most cruel indelicacy, in publishing a conquest
which, since it is rejected, I ought silently, though
gratefully, to bury in my own heart.”</P>
<P>She then related the history of all that had passed to
Camilla; but solemnly declared she would never, to any
other human being, but him who should hereafter be
entitled to her whole heart, betray the secret of the
unhappy Bellamy.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Adviser.</HEAD>
<P>THE wish of Camilla was to lay this whole affair
before her father; but she checked it from an appre∣hension
she might seem displaying her duty and confi∣dence
at the expence of those of her sister; whose mo∣tives
for concealment were intentionally the most pure,
however practically, they might be erroneous; and
whom she both pitied and revered for her proposed
submission to her uncle, in opposition to her palpable
reluctance.</P>
<P>She saw not, however, any obstacle to consulting
with Edgar, since he was already apprised of the busi∣ness,
and since his services might be essentially useful
to her sister: while, with respect to herself, there
seemed, at this time, more of dignity in meeting than
shunning his friendly intercourse, since his regard for
her seemed to have lost all its peculiarity. He has
precisely, cried she the same sentiments for my sisters
as for me,—he is equally kind, disinterested, and in∣different
to us all! anxious alike for Eugenia with
Mr. Bellamy, and for me with the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estable Major!
Be it so!—we can no where obtain a better friend;
and I should blush, indeed, if I could not treat as a
brother one who can treat me as a sister.</P>
<P>Tranquil though not gay, she returned to converse
with him; but when she had related what had passed,
he confessed that his uneasiness upon the subject was
increased. The heart of Eugenia appeared to him po∣sitively
entangled; and he besought Camilla not to
lose a moment in acquainting Mr. Tyrold with her
situation.</P>
<P>She pleaded against giving this pain to her sister
with energetic affection: her arguments failed to con∣vince,
but her eloquence powerfully touched him; and
he contented himself with only entreating that she
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
would again try to aid him with an opportunity of
conversing with Eugenia.</P>
<P>This she could not refuse; nor could he then resist
the opportunity to inquire why Mrs. Arlbery had left
her and Lavinia at the play. She thanked him for re∣membering
his character of her monitor, and acknow∣ledged
the fault to be her own, with a candour so un∣affected,
that, captivated by the soft seriousness of
her manner, he flattered himself his fear of the Major
was a chimaera, and hoped that, as soon as Sir Hugh
was able to again join his family, no impediment
would remain to his begging the united blessings of
the two Brothers to his views.</P>
<P>When Camilla told her sister the request of Edgar
she immediately suspected the attachment of Bellamy
had been betrayed to him; and Camilla, incapable of
any duplicity, related precisely how the matter had
passed. Eugenia, always just, no sooner heard than
she forgave it and accompanied her sister immediately
down stairs.</P>
<P>“I must rest all my hope of pardon,” cried Edgar,
“for the part I am taking, to your conviction of its
motive; a filial love and gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, a
fraternal affection and interest for all his family.”</P>
<P>“My own sisterly feelings,” she answered, “make
me both comprehend and thank your kind solicitude:
but, believe me, it is now founded in error. I am
shocked to find you informed of this unhappy transac∣tion;
and I charge and beseech that no inference may
wound its ill-fated object, by suffering him to surmise
your knowledge of his humiliating situation.”</P>
<P>“I would not for the world give you pain,” answer∣ed
Edgar: “but permit me to be faithful to the bro∣therly
character in which I consider myself to stand
with you all.”</P>
<P>A blush had overspread his face at the word Bro∣therly;
while at that of <HI>all,</HI> which recovered him, a
still deeper stained the cheeks of Camilla: but neither
of them looked at the other; and Eugenia was too
self-absorbed to observe either.</P>
<P>“Your utter inexperience in life,” he continued,
“makes me, though but just giving up leading-strings
myself, an adept in the comparison. Suffer
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
me then as such to represent to you my fears, that
your innocence and goodness may expose you to im∣position.
You must not judge all characters by the
ingenuousness of your own; nor conclude however
rationally and worthily a mind such as yours might—
may—and will inspire a disinterested regard, that there
is no danger of any other, and that mercenary views
are out of the question, because mercenary principles
are not declared.”</P>
<P>“I will not say your inference is severe replied Eu∣genia,”
“because you know not the person of whom
you speak: but permit me to make this irrefragable
vindication of his freedom from all sordid motives;
he has never once named the word fortune, neither to
make any inquiries into mine, nor any professions con∣cerning
his own. Had he any inducement to duplicity,
he might have asserted to me what he pleased, since I
have no means of detection.”</P>
<P>“Your situation,” said Edgar, “is pretty general∣ly
known;” and for his—pardon me if I hint it may
be possible that silence is no virtue. However, since I
am unacquainted, you say with his character, will you
give me leave to make myself better informed?</P>
<P>“There needs no investigation; to me it is perfectly
known.”</P>
<P>“Forgive me if I ask how!”</P>
<P>“By his letters and by his conversation.”</P>
<P>A smile which stole upon the features of Edgar
obliged him to turn his head another way; but pre∣sently
recovering, “My dear Miss Eugenia,” he cried,
“will it not be most consonant to your high principles,
and scrupulous delicacy, to lay the whole of what has
passed before Mr. Tyrold?”</P>
<P>“Undoubtedly, if my part were not strait forward.
Had I the least hesitation, my father should be my im∣mediate
and decisive umpire. But—I am not at liber∣ty
even for deliberation!—I am not—I know—at my
own disposal!”—</P>
<P>She blushed and looked down, confused; but pre∣sently,
with firmness, added, “It is not, indeed, fit
that I should be; my uncle completely merits to be
in all things my director. To know his wishes, there∣fore,
is not only to know, but to be satisfied with my
doom. Such being my situation, you cannot misun∣derstand
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
my defence of this unhappy young man.
It is but simple justice to rescue an amiable person
from calumny.”</P>
<P>“Let us allow all this,” said Edgar; “still I see
no reason why Mr. Tyrold—”</P>
<P>“Mr. Mandlebert,” interrupted she, “you must
do what you judge right. I can desire no one to ab∣stain
from pursuing the dictates of their own sense of
honour. I leave you, therefore, unshackled: but
there is no consideration which, in my opinion, can
justify a female in spreading, even to her nearest con∣nexions,
an unrequited partiality. If, therefore, I am
forced to inflict this undue mortification, upon a person
to whom I hold myself so much obliged, an uneasiness
will remain upon my mind, destructive of my forget∣fulness
of an event which I would fain banish from my
memory.”</P>
<P>She then refused to be any longer detained.</P>
<P>“How I love the perfect innocence, and how I
reverence the respectable singularity of that charming
character!” cried Edgar; “yet how vain are all
arguments against such a combination of fearless cre∣dulity,
and enthusiastic reasoning? What can we
determine?”</P>
<P>“I am happy to retort upon you that question,”
replied Camilla; “for I am every way afraid to act
myself, lest I should hurt this dear sister, or do wrong
by my yet dearer father.”</P>
<P>“What a responsibility you cast upon me! I will
not, however, shrink from it, for the path seems far
plainer to me since I have had this conversation.
Eugenia is at present safe; I see, now, distinctly, her
heart is yet untouched. The readiness with which she
met the subject, the openness with which she avows her
esteem, the unembarrassed, though modest simplicity
with which she speaks of his passion and his distress, all
shew that her pity results from generosity, not from
love. Had it been otherwise, with all her steadiness,
all her philosophy, some agitation and anxiety would
have betrayed her secret soul. The internal work∣ings
of hopes and fears, the sensitive alarms of re∣pressed
consciousness—” A deep glow, which
hoated his face, forced him here to break off; and,
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
abruptly leaving his sentence unfinished, he hastily
began another.</P>
<P>“We must not, nevertheless, regard this as secu∣rity
for the future, though it is safety for the present;
nor trust her unsuspicious generosity of mind to the
dangerous assault of artful distress. I speak without re∣serve
of this man; for though I know him not, as she
remonstrated, I cannot, from the whole circumstances
of his clandestine conduct, doubt his being an adven∣turer
—You say nothing? tell me, I beg your opi∣nion.”</P>
<P>Camilla had not heard one word of this last speech.
Struck with his discrimination between the actual and the
possible state of Eugenia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s mind, and with the effect the
definition had produced upon himself, her attention was
irresistibly seized by a new train of ideas, till finding he
waited for an answer, she mechanically repeated his last
word “opinion?”</P>
<P>He saw her absence of mind, and suspected his own
too palpable disturbance had occasioned it: but in what
degree, or from what sensations, he could not conjec∣ture.
They were both some time silent; and then, re∣collecting
herself, she said it was earnestly her wish to
avoid disobliging her sister, by a communication which,
made by any one but herself, must put her into a dis∣graceful
point of view.</P>
<P>Edgar, after a pause, said, they must yield, then, to
her present fervour, and hope her sounder judgment,
when less played upon, would see clearer. It appear∣ed
to him, indeed, that she was so free, at this moment,
from any dangerous impression, that it might, perhaps,
be even safer to submit quietly to her request, than to
urge the generous romance of her temper to new work∣ings.
He undertook, mean time, to keep a constant
watch upon the motions of Bellamy, to make sedulous
inquiries into his character and situation in life, and to
find out for what ostensible purpose he was in Hamp∣shire:
entreating leave to communicate constantly to
Camilla what he might gather, and to consult with her,
from time to time, upon what measures should be pursued:
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
yet ultimately confessing, that if Eugenia did not steadi∣ly
persist in refusing any further rejections, he should
hold himself bound in conscience to communicate the
whole to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>Camilla was pleased, and even thankful for the ex∣treme
friendliness and kind moderation of this arrange∣ment;
yet she left him mournfully, in a confirmed be∣lief
his regard for the whole family was equal.</P>
<P>Eugenia, much gratified, promised she would hence∣forth
take no step with which Edgar should not first be
acquainted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Various Consabulations.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold saw, at first, the renewed visits of Edgar
at Cleves with extreme satisfaction; but while all his
hopes were alive from an intercourse almost perpetual,
he perceived, with surprise and perplexity, that his
daughter became more and more pensive after every
interview: and as Edgar, this evening, quitted the house,
he observed tears start into her eyes as she went up
stairs to her own room.</P>
<P>Alarmed and disappointed, he thought it now high
time to investigate the state of the affair, and to en∣courage
or prevent future meetings, as it appeared to
him to be propitious or hopeless.</P>
<P>Penetrated with the goodness, while lamenting the
indifference of Edgar, Camilla had just reached her
room; when, as she turned round to shut her door, Mr.
Tyrold appeared before her.</P>
<P>Hastily, with the back of her hand, brushing off the
tears from her eyes, she said, “May I go to my uncle,
Sir?—can my uncle admit me?”</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>
“He can always admit you,” he answered; “but,
just now, you must forget him a moment, and consign
yourself to your father.”</P>
<P>He then entered, shut the door, and making her sit
down by him, said, “What is this sorrow that assails
my Camilla? Why is the light heart of my dear and
happy child thus dejected?”</P>
<P>Speech and truth▪ were always one with Camilla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who, as she could not in this instance declare what
were her feelings, remained mute and confounded.</P>
<P>“Hesitate not, my dear girl,” cried he kindly, “to
unbosom your griefs or your apprehensions, where they
will be received with all the tenderness due to such a
confidence, and held sacred from every human inspec∣tion;
unless you permit me yourself to entrust your best
and wisest friend”</P>
<P>Camilla now trembled, but could not even attempt to
speak.</P>
<P>He saw her disorder, and presently added, “I will
forbear to probe your feelings, when you have satisfied
me in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one doubt;—is the sadness I have of late re∣marked
in you the effect of secret personal disturbance,
or of disappointed expectation?”</P>
<P>Camilla could neither answer nor look up: she was
convinced, by this question, that the subject of her me∣lancholy
was understood, and felt wholly overcome by
the deeply distressing confusion, with which wounded
pride and unaffected virgin modesty impress a youthful
female, in the idea of being suspected of a misplaced,
or an unrequited partiality.</P>
<P>Her silence, a suffocating sigh, and her earnest en∣deavour
to hide her face, easily explained to Mr. Tyrold
all that passed within; and respecting rather than wish∣ing
to conquer a shame flowing from fearful delicacy,
“I would spare you,” he said, “all investigation what∣ever,
could I be certain you are not called into any
action; but, in that case, I know not that I can justify
to myself so implicit a confidence, in youth and in∣experience
so untried in difficulties, so unused to evil
or embarrassment as yours. Tell me then, my dear
Camilla, do you sigh under the weight of any disingenu∣ous
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
conduct? or do you suffer from some suspence
which you have no means of terminating?”</P>
<P>“My dearest father, no!” cried she, sinking upon
his breast. “I have no suspence!”</P>
<P>She gasped for breath.</P>
<P>“And how has it been removed, my child?” said
Mr. Tyrold, in a mournful tone; “has any deception,
any ungenerous art▪”</P>
<P>“O no, no! he is incapable—he is superior—he—”
She stopt abruptly; shocked at the avowal these few
words at once inferred of her partiality, of its hopeless∣ness,
and of its object.</P>
<P>She walked, confused, to a corner of the room, and,
leaning against the wainscot, enveloped her face in her
handkerchief, with the most painful sensations of
shame.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold remained in deep meditation. Her re∣gard
for Edgar he had already considered as undoubted,
and her undisguised acknowledgment excited his ten∣derest
sympathy: but to find she thought it without re∣turn,
and without hope, penetrated him with grief. Not
only his own fond view of the attractions of his daugh∣ter,
but all he had observed, even from his childhood,
in Edgar, had induced him to believe she was irresisti∣bly
formed to captivate him; and what had lately
passed had seemed a confirmation of all he had expect∣ed.
Camilla, nevertheless, exculpated him from all
blame; and, while touched by her artlessness, and
honouring her truth, he felt, at least, some consolation
to find that Edgar, whom he loved as a son, was un∣tainted
by deceit, unaccused of any evil. He con∣cluded
that some unfortunate secret entanglement, or
some mystery not yet to be developed, directed compul∣satorily
his conduct, and checked the dictates of his taste
and inclination.</P>
<P>Gently, at length, approaching her, “My dearest
child,” he said, “I will ask you nothing further; all
that is absolutely essential for me to know, I have ga∣thered.
You will never, I am certain, forget the no∣ble
mother whom you are bound to revere in imitating,
nor the affectionate father whom your ingenuousness
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
renders the most indulgent of your friends. Dry up
your tears then, my Camilla, and command your best
strength to conceal for ever their source, and, most espe∣cially
—from its cause.”</P>
<P>He then embraced, and left her.</P>
<P>“Yes, my dearest father,” cried she, as she shut the
door. “most perfect and most lenient of human beings!
yes, I will obey your dictates; I will hide till I can con∣quer
this weak emotion, and no one shall ever know,
and Edgar least of all that a daughter of yours has a
feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outgh to disguise!”</P>
<P>Elevated by the kindness of a father so adored, to
deserve his good opinion now included every wish. The
least severity would have chilled her confidence, the least
reproof <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have discouraged all effort to self-con∣quest;
but, while his softness had soothed, his appro∣bation
had invigorated her; and her feelings received
additional energy from the conscious generosity with
which she had represented Edgar as blameless. Blame∣less,
however, in her own breast, she could not deem
him: his looks, his voice, his manner,—words that
occasionally dropt from him, and meanings yet more
expressive which his eyes or his attentions had taken in
charge, all, from time to time, had told a flattering
tale, which▪ though timidity and anxious earnestness
had obsured from her perfect comprehension, her hopes
and her sympathy had prevented from wholly escaping
her. Yet what, internally, she could not defend she
forgave; and, acquitting him of all intentional deceit,
concluded that what he had felt for her, he had thought
too slight and immaterial to deserve repressing on his
own part, or notice on her's. To continue with him
her present sisterly conduct was all she had to study, not
doubting but that what as yet was effort, would in time
become natural.</P>
<P>Strengthened thus in fortitude, she descended chear∣fully
to supper, where Mr. Tyrold, though he saw with
pain that her spirits were constrained, felt the fondest
satisfaction in the virtue of her exertion.</P>
<P>Her night passed in the consolation of self-applause.
My dear father, thought she, will see I strive to merit his
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
and that soothing consideration with the honour∣able
friendship of Edgar, will be sufficient for the hap∣piness
of my future life, in the single and tranquil state
in which it will be spent.</P>
<P>Thus comforted, she again met the eye of Mr.
Tyrold the next day at breakfast; in the midst of which
repast Edgar entered the parlour. The tea she was
drinking was then rather gulped than sipped; yet she
maintained an air of unconcern, and returned his salu∣tation
with apparent composure.</P>
<P>Edgar, while addressing to Mr. Tyrold his inquiries
concerning Sir Hugh, saw, from the window, his ser∣vant,
whom he had out-gallopped, thrown with vio∣lence
from his horse. He rushed out of the parlour;
and the first person to rise, with involuntary intent to
follow him, was Camilla. But, as she reached the
hall-door, she saw that the man was safe, and perceived
that her father was the only person who had left the
room besides herself. Ashamed, she returned, and
found the female party collected at the windows.</P>
<P>Hoping to retrieve the error of her eagerness, she
seated herself at the table, and affected to finish her
breakfast.</P>
<P>Eugenia told her they had discovered the cause of the
accident, which had been owing to a sharp stone that
had penetrated into the horse's hoof, and which Edgar
was now endeavouring to extract.</P>
<P>A general scream, just then, from the window party,
and a cry from Eugenia of “O Edgar!” carried her
again to the hall-door with the swiftness of lightning,
calling out, “Where?—What?—Good Hea∣ven!”
—</P>
<P>Molly Mill, accidentally there before her, said, as
she approached, that the horse had kicked Mr. Mandle∣bert
upon the shoulder.</P>
<P>Every thing but tenderness and terror was now for∣gotten
by Camilla; she darted forward with unrestrain∣ed
velocity, and would have given, in a moment, the
most transporting amazement to Edgar, and to herself
the deepest shame, but that Mr. Tyrold, who alone had
his face that way, stopt, and led her back to the house,
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
saying, “There is no mischief: a bee stung the poor
animal at the instant the stone was extracted, and the
surprise and pain made it kick; but, fortunately, without
any bad effect▪ I wish to know how your uncle is;
I should be glad you would go and sit with him till I
can come.”</P>
<P>With these words he left her; and, though abashed
and overset, she found no sensation so powerful as joy
for the safety of Edgar.</P>
<P>Still, however, too little at ease for conversing with
her uncle▪ she went straight to her own chamber, and
flew involuntarily to a window, whence the first object
that met her eyes was her father, who was anxiously
looking up. She retreated, utterly confounded and
threw herself upon a chair at the other end of the
room.</P>
<P>Shame now was her only sensation. The indiscre∣tion
of her first surprize, she knew he must forgive,
though she blushed at its recollection; but a solicitude
so pertinacious, an indulgence so repeated of feelings
he had enjoined her to combat—how could she hope
for his pardon? or how obtain her own, to have forfeited
an approbation so precious?</P>
<P>She could not go to her uncle; she would have re∣mained
where she was till summoned to dinner, if the
house-maid, after finishing all her other work, had not
a third time returned to inquire if she might clean her
room.</P>
<P>She then determined to repair to the library, where
she was certain only to encounter Eugenia, who would
not torment, or Dr. Orkborne, who would not perceive
her: but at the bottom of the stairs she was stopt by
Miss Margland, who, with a malicious smile, asked if
she was going to hold the bason?</P>
<P>“What bason?” cried she, surprised.</P>
<P>“The bason for the surgeon.”</P>
<P>“What surgeon?” repeated she, alarmed.</P>
<P>“Mr. Burton, who is come to bleed Mr. Mandle∣bert.”</P>
<P>She asked nothing more. She felt extremely faint,
but made her way into the park, to avoid further con∣ference.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Here, in the most painful suspence, dying for infor∣mation,
yet shirking who ever could give it her, she
remained, till she saw the departure of the surgeon.
She then went round by a back way to the apartment of
Eugenia, who informed her that the contusion, though
not dangerous, was violent, and that Mr. Tyrold had
insisted upon immediate bleeding. The surgeon had
assured them this precaution would prevent any ill con∣sequence;
but Sir Hugh, hearing from the servants
what had happened, had desired that Edgar would not
return home till the next day.</P>
<P>The joy of Camilla, that nothing was more serious,
banished all that was disagreeable from her thoughts,
till she was called back to reflections less consoling, by
meeting Mr. Tyrold, as she was returning to her own
room; who, with a gravity unusual, desired to speak
with her, and preceded her into the chamber.</P>
<P>Trembling, and filled with shame, she followed,
shut the door, and remained at it without daring to look
up.</P>
<P>“My dear Camilla,” cried he with earnestness,
“let me not hope in vain for that exertion you have
promised me, and to which I know you to be fully
equal. Risk not, my dear girl, to others, those out∣ward
marks of sensibility which, to common or unfeel∣ing
observers, seem but the effect of an unbecoming re∣missness
in the self-command which should dignify every
female who would do herself honour. I had hoped, in
this house at least, you would not have been misunder∣stood;
but I have this moment been undeceived: Miss
Margland has just expressed a species of compassion for
what she presumes to be the present state of your mind,
that has given me the severest pain.”</P>
<P>He stopt, for Camilla looked thunderstruck.</P>
<P>Approaching her, then, with a look of concern, and
a voice of tenderness, he kindly took her hand, and
added: “I do not tell you this in displeasure, but to put
you upon your guard. You will hear from Eugenia
that we shall not dine alone; and from what I have
dropt you will gather how little you can hope to escape
scrutiny. Exert yourself to obviate all humiliating sur∣mises,
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
and you will amply be repaid by the balm of self∣approbation.”</P>
<P>He then kissed her, and quitted the room.</P>
<P>She now remained in utter despair: the least idea of
disgrace totally broke her spirit, and she sat upon the
same spot on which Mr. Tyrold had left her, till the
ringing of the second dinner bell.</P>
<P>She then gloomily resolved to plead an head-ach,
and not to appear.</P>
<P>When a foot man tapt at her door, to acquaint her
every body was seated at the table, she sent down this
excuse: forming to herself the further determination,
that the same should suffice for the evening, and for
the next morning, that she might avoid the sight of
Edgar, in presence either of her father or Miss Marg∣land.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with kind alarm, came to know what was
the matter, and informed her, that Sir Hugh had been
so much concerned at the accident of Edgar, that he
had insisted upon seeing him, and, after heartily shak∣ing
hands, had promised to think no more of past
mistakes and disappointments, as they had now been
cleared up to the county, and desired him to take up
his abode at Cleves for a week.</P>
<P>Camilla heard this with mixt pleasure and pain. She
rejoiced that Edgar should be upon his former terms
with her beloved uncle; but how preserve the caution
demanded from her for so long a period, in the con∣stant
sight of her now watchful father, and the malici∣ous
Miss Margland?</P>
<P>She had added to her own difficulties by this pre∣sent
absconding, and, with severe self-blame, resolved
to descend to tea. But, while settling how to act,
after he sister had left her, she was struck with hearing
the name of Mandlebert pronounced by Mary, the
house-maid, who was talking with Molly Mill upon the
landing place. Why it had been spoken she knew not;
but Molly answered: “Dearee me, never mind; I'll
help you to do his room, if Nanny don't come in time.
My little mistress would rather do it herself, than he
should want for any thing.”</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46"/>
“Why, it's natural enough,” said Mary, “for young
ladies to like young gentlemen; and there's none other
comes a nigh 'em, which I often thinks dull enough
for our young misses. And, to be certain, Mr. Man∣dlebert
would be as pretty a match for one of 'em, as a
body could desire.”</P>
<P>“And his man,” said Molly, “is as pretty a gen∣tleman
sort of a person, to my mind, as his master.
I'm sure I'm as glad as my young lady when they comes
to the house.”</P>
<P>“O, as to Miss Eugeny,” said Mary, “I believe,
in my conscience, she likes our cracked-headed old
Doctor as well as e'er a young gentleman in Christen∣dom;
for there she'll sit with him, hour by hour poring
over such a heap of stuff as never was seed, reading,
first one, then t'other, God knows what; for I
believe never nobody heard the like of it before;
and all the time never give the old Doctor a cross
word.—”</P>
<P>“She never given nobody a cross word,” interrupt∣ed
Molly; “if I was Mr. Mandlebert, I'd sooner have
her than any of em, for all she's such a nidging little
thing.”</P>
<P>“For certain,” said Mary, “she's very good, and a
deal of good she does, to all as asks her; but Miss Ca∣milla
for my money. She's all alive and merry, and
makes poor master young again to look at her. I wish
Mr. Mandlebert would have her, for I have overheard
Miss Margland telling Miss Lynmere she was desperate
fond of him, and did all she could to get him.”</P>
<P>Camilla felt flushed with the deepest resentment, and
could scarcely command herself to forbear charging Miss
Margland with this persecuting cruelty.</P>
<P>Nanny, the under house-maid, now joining them,
said she had been detained to finish altering a curtain for
Miss Margland. “And the cross old Frump,” she
added, “is in a worse spite than ever, and she kept
abusing that sweet Mr. Mandlebert to Miss Lynmere
all the while, till she went down to dinner, and she said
she was sure it was all Miss Camilla's doings his stay∣ing
here again, for she could come over master for any
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
thing: and she said she supposed it was to have another
catch at the young 'Squire's heart, but she hoped he
would not be such a fool.”</P>
<P>“I'm sure I wish he would,” cried Molly Mill, “if
it was only to spite her, she's such a nasty old viper.
And Miss Camilla's always so good-natured, and so
affable, she'd make him a very agreeable wife, I dare
say.”</P>
<P>“And she's mortal fond of him, that's true,” said
Mary, “for when they was both here, I always see
her a running to the window, to see who was a coming
into the park, when he was rode out; and when he
was in the house, she never so much as went to peep,
if there come six horses, one after t'other. And she
was always saying `Mary, who's in the parlour? Mary,
who's below?' while he was here; but before he come,
duce a bite did she ask about nobody.”</P>
<P>“I like when I meets her,” said Molly Mill, “to
tell her Mr. Mandlebert's here▪ Miss; or Mr. Mandle∣bert's
there, Miss;—Dearee me, one may almost see
one self in her eyes, it makes them shine so.”</P>
<P>Camilla could endure no more; she arose, and walk∣ed
about the room; and the maids, who had con∣cluded
her at dinner, hearing her step, hurried away,
to finish their gossping in the room of Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Camilla now felt wholly sunk; the persecutions of
Miss Margland seemed nothing to this blow: they were
cruel, she could therefore repine at them; they were un∣provoked,
she could therefore repel them: but to find her
secret feelings, thus generally spread, and familiarly com∣mented
upon, from her own unguarded conduct, exhaust∣ed,
at once, patience, fortitude, and hope, and left her
no wish but to quit Cleves while Edgar should remain
there.</P>
<P>Certain, however, that her father would not permit
her to return to Etherington alone, a visit to Mrs. Arl∣bery
was the sole refuge she could suggest; and she
determined to solicit his permission to accept immediate∣ly
the invitation of that lady.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Dodging.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA waited in the apartment of Mr. Tyrold
till he came up stairs, and then begged his leave to spend
a few days at the Grove; hinting, when he hesitated,
though with a confusion that was hardly short of torture,
at what had passed amongst the servants.</P>
<P>He heard her with the tenderest pity, and the kindest
praise of her sincerity; and, deeply as he was shocked
to find her thus generally betrayed, he was too com∣passionate
to point out, at so suffering a moment, the in∣discretions
from which such observations must have ori∣ginated.
Yet he saw consequences the most unpleasant
in this rumour of her attachment; and though he still
privately hoped that the behaviour of Mandlebert was
the effect of some transient embarrassment, he wished
her removed from all intercourse with him that was not
sought by himself, while the incertitude of his inten∣tions
militated against her struggles for indifference.
The result, therefore, of a short deliberation was to ac∣cede
to her request.</P>
<P>Camilla then wrote her proposition to Mrs. Arlbery,
which Mr. Tyrold sent immediately by a stable-boy of
the baronet's.</P>
<P>The answer was most obliging; Mrs. Arlbery said
she would herself fetch her the next morning, and keep
her till one of them should be tired.</P>
<P>The relief which this, at first, brought to Camilla, in
the week's exertions it would spare, was soon succeed∣ed
by the most acute uneasiness for the critical situation
of Eugenia, and the undoubted disapprobation of Ed∣gar.
To quit her sister at a period when she might serve
her;—to forsake Cleves at the moment Edgar was re∣stored
to it, seemed selfish even to herself, and to him
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
must appear unpardonable. “Alas!” she cried, “how
for ever I repent my hasty actions! Why have I not
better struggled against my unfortunate feelings?”</P>
<P>She now almost hated her whole scheme, regretted
its success, wished herself suffering every uneasiness Miss
Margland could inflict, and all the shame of being
watched and pitied by every servant in the house, in
preference to deserting Eugenia, and making Mandle∣bert
deem her unworthy. But self-upbraiding was all
that followed her contrition: Mrs. Arlbery was to fetch
her by appointment; and it was now too late to trifle
with the conceding goodness of her father.</P>
<P>She did not dare excuse herself from appearing at
breakfast the next morning lest Mr Tyrold should
think her utterly incorrigible to his exhortations.</P>
<P>Edgar earnestly inquired after her health as she en∣tered
the room; she slightly answered she was better;
and began eating, with an apparent eagerness of appe∣tite:
while he, who had expected some kind words
upon his own accident, surprised and disappointed, could
swallow nothing.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, seeing and pitying what passed in her
mind, gave her a commission, that enabled her, soon,
to leave the room without affectation; and, happy to
escape, she determined to go down stairs no more till
Mrs. Arlbery arrived. She wished to have conversed
first upon the affairs of Eugenia with Edgar: but to
name to him whither she was herself going, when she
could not possibly name why; to give to him a surprise
that must recoil upon herself in disapprobation, wās
more than she could endure. She had invested him
with full powers to counsel and to censure her; he
would naturally use them to dissuade her from a visit
so ill-timed; and what could she urge in opposition to
his arguments that would not seem trifting or wilful?</P>
<P>The present moment was all that occupied, the pre∣sent
evil all that ever alarmed the breast of Camilla:
to avoid him, therefore, now, was the whole of her de∣sire,
unmolested with one anxiety how she might better
meet him hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
She watched at her window till she saw the groom of
Mrs. Arlbery gallop into the Park. She hastened then
to take leave of Sir Hugh, whom Mr. Tyrold had pre∣pared
for her departure; but, at the door of his apart∣ment,
she encountered Edgar.</P>
<P>“You are going out?” cried he, perceiving an altera∣tion
in her dress.</P>
<P>“I am—just going to—to speak to my uncle,” cried
she, stammering and entering the room at the same
moment.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh kindly wished her much amusement, and
hoped she would make him long amends when he was
better. She took leave; but again, on the landing-place,
met Edgar, who, anxious and perplexed, watch∣ed
to speak to her before she descended the stairs.
Eagerly advancing “Do you walk?” he cried; “may
I ask? or—am I indiscreet?”</P>
<P>She answered she had something to say to Eugenia,
but should be back in an instant. She then flew to the
chamber of her sister, and conjured her to consult Edgar
in whatever should occur during her absence. Eugenia
solemnly consented.</P>
<P>Jacob presently tapped at the door, to announce that
Mrs. Arlbery was waiting below in her carriage.</P>
<P>How to pass or escape Edgar became now her great∣est
difficulty; she could suggest nothing to palliate to
him the step she was taking, yet could still less bear to
leave him to wild conjecture and certain blame: and she
was standing irresolute and thoughtful, when Mr. Tyrold
came to summon her.</P>
<P>After mildly representing the indecorum of detain∣ing
any one she was to receive by appointment, he took
her apart, and putting a packet into her hand, “I
would not,” he said, “agitate your spirits this morn∣ing,
by entering upon any topic that might disturb you:
I have therefore put upon paper what I most desire you
to consider. You will find it a little sermon upon the
difficulties and the conduct of the female heart. Read
it alone, and with attention. And now, my dearest
girl, go quietly into the parlour, and let one brief and
cheerful good-morrow serve for every body alike.”</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>
He then returned to his brother.</P>
<P>She made Eugenia accompany her down stairs, to
avoid any solitary attack from Edgar; he suffered them
to pass; but followed to the parlour, where she hastily
bid adieu to Miss Margland and Indiana; but was stopt
from running off by the former, who said, “I wish I
had known you intended going out, for I designed
asking Sir Hugh for the chariot for myself this morning,
to make a very particular visit.”</P>
<P>Camilla, in a hesitating voice, said she should not use
her uncle's chariot.</P>
<P>“You walk then?”</P>
<P>“No,—ma'am—but—there is—there is a carriage
I believe, now at the door.”</P>
<P>“O dear, whose?” cried Indiana; “do, pray, tell
me where you are going?” while Edgar▪ still more cu∣rious
than either, held out his hand to conduct her, that
he might obtain better information.</P>
<P>“I am very glad your head-ach is so well,” said Miss
Margland; “but, pray—is Mr. Mandlebert to be your
chaperon?”</P>
<P>They both blushed, though both affected not to hear
her: but, before they could quit the room, Indiana,
who had run to a bow-window, exclaimed, “Dear!
if there it not Mrs. Arlbery in a beautiful high phea∣ton!”</P>
<P>Edgar, astonished, was now as involuntarily drawing
back, as Camilla, involuntarily, was hurrying on: but
Miss Margland, insisting upon an answer, desired to
know if she should return to dinner?</P>
<P>She stammer out, No. Miss Margland pursued her
to ask at what time the chariot was to fetch her; and
forced from her a confession that she should be away for
some days.</P>
<P>She was now permitted to proceed. Edgar, impress∣ed
with the deepest displeasure, leading her in silence
across the hall: but, stopping an instant at the door,
“This excursion,” he gravely said, “will rescue you
from no little intended importunity: I had purposed tor∣menting
you, from time to time, for your opinion and
directions with respect to Miss Eugenia.”</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52"/>
And then, bowing coldly to Mrs. Arlbery, who eager∣ly
called out to welcome her, he placed her in the phae∣ton,
which instantly drove off.</P>
<P>He looked after them for some time, almost incre∣dulous
of her departure: but, as his amazement sub∣sided
into certainty, the most indignant disappointment
succeeded. That she could leave Cleves at the very mo∣ment
he was reinstated in its society, seemed convic∣tion
to him of her indifference; and that she could
leave it in the present state of the affairs of Eugenia,
made him conclude her so great a slave to the love of
pleasure, that every duty and all propriety were to be
sacrified to its pursuit. “I will think of her,” cried
he. “no more! She concealed from me her plan,
lest I should torment her with admonitions: the glaring
homage of the Major is better adapted to her taste,—
She flies from my sincerity to receive his adulation,—
I have been deceived in her disposition,—I will think
of her no more!”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>THE kind reception of Mrs. Arlbery, and all the
animation of her discourse, were thrown away upon
Camilla. An absent smile, and a few faint acknow∣ledgments
of her goodness were all she could return:
Eugenia abandoned when she might have been served,
Edgar contemning when he might have been approving
—these were the images of her mind, which resisted
entrance to all other.</P>
<P>Tired of fruitless attempts to amuse her, Mrs. Arl∣bery,
upon their arrival at the Grove, conducted her
to an apartment prepared for her, and made use of no
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
persuasion that she would leave it before din∣ner.</P>
<P>Camilla then, too unhappy to fear any injunction, and
resigned to whatever she might receive, read the dis∣course
of Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For Miss Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my intention to enumerate, my dear Ca∣milla,
the many blessings of your situation; your heart is
just and affectionate, and will not forget them: I mean
but to place before you your immediate duties, satisfied
that the review will ensure their performance.</P>
<P>Unused to, because undeserving control, your days,
to this period, have been as gay as your spirits It is
now first that your tranquillity is ruffled; it is now,
therefore, that your fortitude has its first debt to pay for
its hitherto happy exemption.</P>
<P>Those who weigh the calamities of life only by the
positive, the substantial, or the irremediable mischiefs
which they produce, regard the first sorrows of early
youth as too trifling for compassion. They do not
enough consider that it is the suffering, not its abstract
cause, which demands human commiseration. The man
who loses his whole fortune, yet possesses firmness, phi∣losophy,
a disdain of ambition, and an accommodation to
circumstances, is less an object of contemplative pity,
than the person who, without one real deprivation, one
actual evil, is first, or is suddenly forced to recognise
the fallacy of a cherished and darling hope.</P>
<P>That its foundation has always been shallow is no mi∣tigation
of disappointment to him who had only viewed
it in its superstructure. Nor is its downfal less ter∣rible
to its visionary elevator, because others had seen
it from the beginning as a folly or a chimera; its disso∣lution
should be estimated, not by its romance in the
unimpassioned examination of a rational looker-on, but
by its believed promise of felicity to its credulous pro∣jector.</P>
<P>Is my Camilla in this predicament? had she wove her
own destiny in the speculation of her wishes? Alas! to
blame her, I must first forget, that delusion, while in
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
force, has all the semblance of reality, and takes the same
hold upon the faculties as truth. Nor is it till the spell
is broken, till the perversion of reason and error of
judgment become wilful, that Scorn ought to point “its
finger” or Censure its severity.</P>
<P>But of this I have no fear. The love of right is im∣planted
indelibly in your nature, and your own peace is
as dependant as mine and as your mother▪s upon its con∣stant
culture.</P>
<P>Your conduct hitherto has been committed to your∣self.
Satisfied with establishing your principles upon
the adamantine pillars of religion and conscience, we
have not feared leaving you the entire possession of ge∣neral
liberty. Nor do I mean to withdraw it, though
the present state of your affairs, and what for some time
past I have painfully observed of your precipitance, oblige
me to add partial counsel to standing precept, and ex∣hortation
to advice. I shall give them, however, with
diffidence, fairly acknowledging and blending my own
perplexities with yours.</P>
<P>The temporal destiny of woman is enwrapt in still
more impenetrable obscurity than that of man. She be∣gins
her career by being involved in all the worldly ac∣cidents
of a parent; she continues it by being associated
in all that may environ a husband: and the difficulties
arising from this doubly appendant state, are augmented
by the next to impossibility, that the first dependence
should pave the way for the ultimate. What parent yet
has been gifted with the foresight to say, “I will edu∣cate
my daughter for the stat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to which she shall be∣long?”
Let us even suppose that station to be fixed by
himself, rarely as the chances of life authorise such a
presumption; his daughter all duty, and the partner of
his own selection solicitous of the alliance: is he at all
more secure he has provided even for her external wel∣fare?
What, in this sublunary existence, is the state from
which she shall neither rise nor fall? Who shall say that
in a few years, a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> months, perhaps less, the situation
in which the prosperity of his own views has placed
her, may not change for one more humble than he has
sitted her for enduring, or more exalted than he has ac∣complished
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
her for sustaining? The conscience, indeed,
of the father is not responsible for events, but the infeli∣city
of the daughter is not less a subject of pity.</P>
<P>Again, if none of these outward and obvious vici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣tudes
occur, the proper education of a female, either for
use or for happiness, is still to seek, still a problem be∣yond
human solution; since its refinement, or its negli∣gence,
can only prove to her a good or an evil, accor∣ding
to the humour of the husband into whose hands she
may fall. If fashioned to shine in the great world, he
may deem the metropolis all turbulence; if endowed
with every resource for retirement, he may think the
country distasteful. And though her talents, her ac∣quirements,
may in either of these cases be set aside,
with an only silent regret of wasted youth and appli∣cation;
the turn of mind which they have induced, the
appreciation which they have taught of time, of plea∣sure,
or of utility, will have nurtured inclinations and
opinions not so d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctile to new sentiments and employ∣ments,
and either submission becomes a hardship, or re∣sistance
generates dissention.</P>
<P>If such are the parental embarrassments, against which
neither wisdom nor experience can guard, who should
view the filial without sympathy and tenderness?</P>
<P>You have been brought up, my dear child, without
any specific expectation. Your mother and myself, mu∣tually
deliberating upon the uncertainty of the female
fate, determined to educate our girls with as much sim∣plicity
as is compatible with instruction, as much doci∣lity
for various life as may accord with invariable prin∣ciples,
and as much accommodation with the world at
large, as may combine with a just distinction of selected
society We hoped thus, should your lots be elevated,
to secure you from either exulting arrogance, or bashful
insignificance; or should they, as is more probable, be
lowly, to instil into your understandings and characters
such a portion of intellectual vigour as should make you
enter into an humbler scene without debasement, help∣lessness,
or repining.</P>
<P>It is now▪ Camilla, we must demand your exertions
in return. Let not these cares, to sit you for the world
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
as you may find it, be utterly annihilated from doing you
good, by the uncombated sway of an unavailing, how∣ever
well-placed attachment</P>
<P>We will not here canvass the equity of that freedom
by which women as well as men should be allowed to
dispose of their own affections There cannot, in na∣ture,
in theory, nor even in common sense, be a doubt of
their equal right: but disquisitions on this point will re∣main
rather curious than important, till the speculatist
can superinduce to the abstract truth of the position some
proof of its practicability.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it is enough for every modest and rea∣sonable
young woman to consider, that where there are
two parties, choice can belong only to one of them: and
then let her call upon all her feelings of delicacy, all her
notions of propriety, to decide: Since Man must choose
Woman, or Woman Man, which should come forward
to make the choice? Which should retire to be chosen?</P>
<P>A prepossession directed towards a virtuous and de∣serving
object wears, in its first approach the appearance
of a mere tribute of justice to merit. It seems, there∣fore,
too natural, perhaps too generous, to be consider∣ed
either as a folly or a crime. It is only its encou∣ragement
where it is not reciprocal, that can make it in∣cur
the first epithet, or where it ought not to be reci∣procal
that can brand it with the second. With respect
to this last, I know of nothing to apprehend:—with re∣gard
to the first—I grieve to wound my dearest Ca∣milla,
yet where there has been no subject for complaint,
there can have been none for expectation.</P>
<P>Struggle then against yourself as you would struggle
against an enemy. Refuse to listen to a wish, to dwell
even upon a possibility, that opens to your present idea
of happiness. All that in future may be realised prob∣ably
hangs upon this conflict. I mean not to propose to
you in the course of a few days to reinstate yourself in
the perfect security of a disengaged mind I know too
much of the hum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n heart to be ignorant that the accele∣ration,
or delay▪ must depend upon circumstance: I can
only require from you what depends upon yourself, a
steady and courageous warfare against the two dange∣rous
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
underminers of your peace and of your fame, im∣prudence
and impatience. You have champions with
which to encounter them that cannot fail of success,—
good sense and delicacy.</P>
<P>Good sense will shew you the power of self-conquest,
and point out its means. It will instruct you to curb
those unguarded movements which lay you open to the
strictures of others. It will talk to you of those boun∣daries
which custom forbids your sex to pass, and the
hazard of any individual attempt to transgress them.
It will tell you, that where allowed only a negative
choice, it is your own best interest to combat against a
positive wish. It will bid you, by constant occupation,
vary those thoughts that now take but one direction, and
multiply those interests which now recognise but one
object: and it will soon convince you, that it is not
strength of mind which you want, but reflection, to
obtain a strict and unremitting controul over your pas∣sions.</P>
<P>This last word will pain, but let it not shock you.
You have no passions, my innocent girl, at which you
need blush, though enough at which I must tremble!—
For in what consists your constraint, your forbearance?
your wish is your guide, your impulse is your action.
Alas! never yet was mortal created so perfect, that
every wish was virtuous, or every impulse wise!</P>
<P>Does a secret murmur here demand: if a discerning
predilection is no crime, why, internally at least, may
it not be cherished? whom can it injure or offend, that
in the hidden recesses of my own breast, I nourish su∣perior
preference of superior worth?</P>
<P>This is the question with which every young woman
beguiles her fancy; this is the common but seductive
opiate, with which inclination lulls reason.</P>
<P>The answer may be safely comprised in a brief appeal
to her own breast.</P>
<P>I do not desire her to be insensible to merit; I do not
even demand she should confine her social affections to
her own sex, since the most innocent esteem is equally
compatible, though not equally general with ours. I re∣quire
of her simply, that, in her secret hours, when pride
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
has no dominion, and disguise would answer no purpose,
she will ask herself this question, “Could I calmly hear
that this elect of my heart was united to another?
Were I to be informed that the indissoluble knot was
tied, which annihilates all my own future possibilities,
would the news occasion me no affliction?” This, and
this alone, is the test by which she may judge the dan∣ger,
or the harmlessness of her attachment.</P>
<P>I have now endeavoured to point out the obligations
which you may owe to good sense. Your obligations to
delicacy will be but their consequence.</P>
<P>Delicacy is an attribute so peculiarly feminine, that
were your reflections less agitated by your feelings you
could delineate more distinctly than myself its appro∣priate
laws, its minute exactions, its sensitive refine∣ments.
Here, therefore, I seek but to bring back to
your memory what livelier sensations have inadvertently
driven from it.</P>
<P>You may imagine, in the innocency of your heart,
that what you would rather perish than utter can never,
since untold, be suspected: and▪ at present, I am equally
sanguine in believing no surmise to have been conceived
where most it would shock you: yet credit me when I
assure you, that you can make no greater mistake, than
to suppose that you have any security beyond what sedu∣lously
you must earn by the most indefatigable vigilence.
There are so many ways of communication independent
of speech, that silence is but one point in the ordina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces
of discretion. You have nothing, in so modest a cha∣racter,
to apprehend from vanity or presumption; you
may easily, therefore, continue the guardian of your own
dignity: but you must keep in mind, that our percep∣tions
want but little quickening to discern what m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> flat∣ter
them; and it is mutual to either sex to be to no gra∣tification
so alive, as to that of a conscious ascendance
over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the other.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the female who, upon the softening
blandishment of an undisguised prepossession, builds
her expectation of its reciprocity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, in common,
most cruelly deceived. It is not that she has failed to
awaken tenderness; but it has been tenderness without
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
respect: nor yet that the person thus elated has been
insensible to flattery; but it has been a flattery to raise
himself, not its exciter in his esteem. The partiality
which we feel inspires diffidence: that which we create
has a contrary effect. A certainty of success in many
destroys, in all weakens, its charm: the bashful ex∣cepted,
to whom it gives courage; and the indolent,
to whom it saves trouble.</P>
<P>Carefully, then, beyond all other care, shut up every
avenue by which a secret which should die untold
can further escape you. Avoid▪ every species of par∣ticularity;
neither shun nor seek any intercourse ap∣parently;
and in such meetings as general prudence
may render necessary, or as accident may make in∣evitable,
endeavour to behave with the same open esteem
as in your days of unconsciousness. The least un∣usual
attention would not be more suspicious to the
world, than the least undue reserve to the subject of
our discussion. Coldness or distance could only be im∣puted
to resentment; and resentment, since you have
received no offence, how, should it be investigated,
could you vindicate? or how, should it be passed in si∣lence,
secure from being attributed to pique and disap∣pointment?</P>
<P>There is also another motive, important to us all,
which calls for the most rigid circumspection. The
person in question is not merely amiable: he is also
rich: mankind at large, therefore would not give merely
to a sense of excellence any obvious predi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection. This
hint will, I know, powerfully operate upon your dis∣interested
spirit.</P>
<P>Never from personal experience may you gather,
how far from soothing, how wide from honourable,
is the species of compassion ordinarily diffused by the
discovery of an unreturned female regard. That it
should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt unsought may be considered as a mark of
discerning sensibility; but that it should be betrayed un∣called
for, is commonly, however ungenerously, ima∣gined
rather to indicate ungoverned passions, than re∣fined
selection. This is often both cruel and unjust;
yet, let me ask—Is the world a proper confident for
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
such a secret? Can the woman who has permitted it to
go abroad, reasonably demand that consideration and
respect from the community, in which she has been
wanting to herself? To me it would be unnecessary to
observe, that her indiscretion may have been the effect
of an inadvertence which owes its origin to artlessness,
not to forwardness: She is judged by those, who, hard
ened in the ways of men, accustom themselves to trace
in evil every motive to action; or by those who, pre∣ferring
ridicule to humanity, seek rather to amuse them¦selves
wittily with her susceptibility, than to feel for
its innocence and simplicity.</P>
<P>In a state of utter constraint, to appear natural is,
however, an effort too difficult to be long sustained;
and neither precept, example nor disposition, have en∣ured
my poor child to the performance of any studied
part. Discriminate, nevertheless, between hypocrisy
and discretion. The first is a vice; the second a con∣ciliation
to virtue. It is the bond that keeps society
from disunion; the v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il that sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es our weakness from
exposure giving time for that interior correction, which
the publication of our infirmities would else, with res∣pect
to mankind, make of no avail.</P>
<P>It were better no doubt, wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ier, nobler, to meet
the scrutiny of our fellow-creatures by consent, as we
encounter, per force, the all-viewing eye of our Crea∣tor:
but since for this we are not sufficiently without
blemish, we must allow to our unstable virtues all the
encouragement that can prop them▪ The event of dis∣covered
faults is more frequently callousness than amend∣ment;
and propriety of example is as much a duty to
our fellow-creatures, as purity of intention is a debt to
ourselves.</P>
<P>To delicacy, in fine, your present exertions will owe
their future recompence, be your ultimate lot in life
what it may. Should you in the course of time, be∣long
to another, you will be shielded from the regret
that a former attachment had been published; or should
you continue mistress of yourself, from a blush that the
world is acquainted it was not by your choice.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
I shall now conclude this little discourse by calling
upon you to annex to whatever I have offered you of
precept▪ the constant remembrance of your mother for
example.</P>
<P>In our joint names, therefore, I adjure you, my
dearest Camilla, not to embitter the present innocence
of your suffering by imprudence that may attach to
it censure, nor by indulgence that may make it fasten
upon your vitals! Imprudence cannot but end in the
demolition of that dignified equanimity, and modest
propriety, which we wish to be uniformly remarked
as the attributes of your character: and indulgence,
by fixing, may envenom a dart that as yet may be
gently withdrawn, from a wound which kindness may
heal, and time may close: but which, if neglected, may
wear away, in corroding disturbance, all your life's
comfort to yourself, and all its social purposes to your
friends and to the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Chat.</HEAD>
<P>THE calm sadness with which Camilla had opened
her letter was soon broken in upon by the interest of its
contents, the view it displayed of her duties, her shame
at her failures, and her fears for their future execution;
and yet more than all, by the full decision in which it
seemed written, that the unhappy partiality she had ex∣posed,
had been always, and would for ever remain
unreturned.</P>
<P>She started at the intimation how near she stood to
detection even from Edgar himself, and pride, reason,
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
modesty, all arose to strengthen her with resolution,
to guard every future conflict from his observation.</P>
<P>The article concerning fortune touched her to the quick.
Nothing appeared to her so degrading as the most dis∣tant
idea that such a circumstance could have any force
with her. But the justice done to Edgar she gloried in,
as an apology for her feelings, and exculpatory of her
weakness. Her tears flowed fast at every expression
of kindness to herself, her burning blushes dried them
up as they were falling▪ at every hint of her feebleness,
and the hopelessness of its cause; but wholly subdued
by the last paragraph, which with reverence she pressed
to her lips, she offered up the most solemn vows of a
strict and entire observance of every injunction which
the letter contained.</P>
<P>She was thus employed, unnoticing the passage of
time, when Mrs. Arlbery tapped at her door, and
asked if she wished to dine in her own room.</P>
<P>Surprised at the question, and ashamed to be thus
seen, she was beginning a thousand apologies for not
being yet dressed: but Mrs. Arlbery, interrupting her,
said, “I never listen to excuses. 'Tis the only battery
that overpowers me. If, by any mischance, and in an
evil hour, some country cousin, not knowing my ways,
or some antediluvian prig▪ not minding them, happen
to fall upon me with formal speeches, where I can
make no escape, a fit of yawning takes me immediately,
and I am demolished for the rest of the day.”</P>
<P>Camilla, attempting to smile, promised to play the
country cousin no more. Mrs. Arlbery then observed
she had been weeping; and taking her hand, with an
examining look, “My lovely young friend,” she cried,
“this will never do!”</P>
<P>“What, ma'am?—how?—what?—”</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, don't be frightened. Come down to
dinner, and we'll talk over the hows? and the whats?
afterwards. Never mind your dress; we go no where
this evening; and I make a point not to suffer any body to
change their attire in my house, merely because the af∣ternoon
is taking place of the morning. It seems to me
a miserable compliment to the mistress of a mansion, to
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
see her guests only equip themselves for the table. For
my part, I deem the garb that is good enough for me,
good enough for my ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and turkies—apple and oy∣ster-sauce
included.”</P>
<P>Camilla then followed her do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n stairs, where she
found no company but Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>“Come, my dear Miss T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rold,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
“you and I may now consider ourselves as <HI>tête-â-tête;</HI>
Sir Sedley won't be much in our way. He hears and
sees nothing but himself.”</P>
<P>“Ecstatically flattering that!” cried Sir Sedley;
“dulcet to every nerve!”</P>
<P>“O, I know you listen just now, because you are
yourself my theme But the moment I take another,
you will forget we are either of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the room.”</P>
<P>“Inhuman to the quick!” cried he; “barbarous to
a point!”</P>
<P>“This is a creature so strange. Miss Tyrold,” said
Mrs. Arlbery, “that I must positively initiate you a
little into his character;—or, rather, into its own cari∣cature;
for as to character, he has had none intelligible
these three years. See but how he smiles at the very
prospect of being portrayed, in defiance of all his efforts
to look unconcerned! yet he knows I shall shew him
no mercy. But, like all other egotists, the only thing
to really disconcert him, would be to take no notice of
him. Make him but the first subject of discourse, and
praise or abuse are pretty much the same to him.”</P>
<P>“O shocking! shocking! killing past resuscitation!
Abominably horrid, I protest▪”</P>
<P>“O I have not begun yet. This is an observation
to suit thousands. But do not fear; you shall have all
your appropriations. Miss Tyrold▪ you are to be audi∣tor
and judge: and I will save you the time and the
trouble which decyphering this animal, so truly a non∣descript,
might cost you.”</P>
<P>“What a tremendous exordium! distressing to a de∣gree!
I am agued with trepidation!”</P>
<P>“O you wretch! you know you are enchanted. But
no further interruption! I send you to Coventry for the
next ten minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"/>
“This man, my dear Miss Tyrold, whom we are
about to delineate, was meant by nature, and prepared,
by art, for something greatly superior to what he now
appears: but, unhappily, he had neither solidity of judg∣ment,
nor humility of disposition, for bearing meekly
the early advantages with which he set out in life; a
fine person, fine parts, and a sine estate, all dashed into
consciousness at the presuming age of one and twenty.
By this aggregate of wealthy, of mental and of personal
prosperity, he has become at once self spoilt and world
spoilt. Had you known him, as I have done, before he
was seized with this systematic affectation▪ which, I am
satisfied, causes him more study than the united pedants
of both universities could inflict upon him, you would
have seen the most delightful creature breathing! a
creature combining, in one animated composition, the
very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssences of spirit, of gaiety, and of intelligence.
But now, with every thing within his reach, nothing
seems worth his attainment. He has not sufficient
energy to make use of his own powers. He has no one
to command him, and he is too indolent to command
himself He has therefore turned fop from mere wan∣tonness
of time and of talents; from having nothing to
do, no one to care for, and no one to please. Take
from him half his wit, and by lessening his presumption,
you will cure him of all his folly. Rob him of his for∣tune,
and by forcing him into exertion, you will make
him one of the first men of his day. Deface and maim
his features and figure, and by letting him see that to ap∣pear
and be admired is not the same thing, you will ren∣der
him irresistible.”</P>
<P>“Have you done?” cried the baronet smiling.</P>
<P>“I protest,” said Mrs. Arlbery, I believe you are a
little touched! And I don't at all want to reform you.
A perfect character only lulls me to sleep.”</P>
<P>“Obliging in the superlative! I must then take as a
consolation that I have never given you a nap?”</P>
<P>“Never, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> larendel, I assure you; and yet I don't
hate you! Vice is detestable; I banish all its appear∣ances
from my coteries; and I would banish its reality,
too, were I sure I should then have any thing but empty
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
chairs in my drawing-room—but foibles make all the
charm of society. They are the only support of con∣vivial
raillery, and domestic wit. If formerly, there∣fore,
you more excited my admiration, it is now, be∣lieve
me, you contribute most to my entertainment.”</P>
<P>“Condoling to a phenomenon! I have really, then,
the vastly prodigious honour to be exalted in your fair
graces to the level of a mountebank? a quack doctor,
his merry Andrew? or any other such respectable buf∣foon?”</P>
<P>“Piqued! piqued! I declare! this exceeds my high∣est
ambition. But I must not weaken the impression by
dwelling upon it.”</P>
<P>She then asked Camilla if she had any message for
Cleves, as one of her servants was going close to the
park gate.</P>
<P>Camilla, glad to withdraw, said she would write a few
words to her father, and retired for that purpose.</P>
<P>“What in the world, my dear Clarendel,” said Mrs.
Arlbery, 'can I do with this poor thing? She has lost
all her sprightliness▪ and vapours me but to look at her.
She has all the symptoms upon her of being in the full
meridian of that common girlish disease, an hopeless
passion”</P>
<P>“Poor little tender dove!” cried the baronet.
“'Twould be odious to cure her. Unfeeling to excess.
What in nature can be half so mellisiuously interesting?
I shall now look at her with most prodigious softness.
Ought one not to sigh as she approaches?</P>
<P>`The matter to be sure is silly enough, answered
Mrs. Arlbery; “but, this nonsense apart, she is a char∣ming
girl. Besides, I perceive I am a violent favourite
with her; an flattery, my dear Clarendel, will work its
way, even with me! I really owe her a good turn: Else
I should no longer endure her; for the tender passion
has terribly flattened her. If we can't restore her spi∣rits,
she will be a mere dead weight to me.”</P>
<P>“O a very crush! a cannon ball would be a butterfly
in the comparison! But who is the irresistible? What
form has the little blind traitor assumed?”</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>
“O, assure yourself, that of the first young man who
has come in her sight. Every damsel, as she enters the
world, has some picture ready painted upon her imagi∣nation,
of an object worthy to enslave her: and before
any experience forms her judgment, or any comparison
her taste, she is the dupe of the first youth who presents
himself to her, in the firm persuasion of her ductile
fancy, that he is just the model it had previously cre∣ated.”</P>
<P>She then added, she had little doubt but young Man∣dlebert
was the hero, from their private conferences af∣ter
the raffle, and from her blushes when forced to name
him.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, this is not of the first incongruity!” said
the young baronet, “not romantic to outrage. Beech
park has nothing very horrific in it. Nothing invinci∣bly
beyond the standard of a young lady's philosopy.”</P>
<P>“Depend upon it, that's the very idea its master has
conceived of the matter himself. You wealthy Cava∣liers
rarely want flappers to remind you of your ad∣vantages.
That Mandlebert, you must know, is my
aversion. He has just that air and reputation of fault∣lessness
that gives me the spleen. I hope, for her sake,
he won't think of her; he will lead her a terrible life.
A man who piques himself upon his perfections, finds
no mode so convenient and ready for displaying them,
as proving all about him to be constantly in the wrong.
However, a character of that stamp rarely marries; es∣pecially
if he is rich, and has no obstacles in his way.
What can I do, then, for this poor thing? The very
nature of her malady is to make her entertain false
hopes. I am quite bent upon curing them. The only
difficulty, according to custom, is how. I wish you
would take her in hand yourself”</P>
<P>“I?—preposterous in the extreme! what particle of
chance should I have against Mandlebert?</P>
<P>“O you vain wretch! to be sure you don't know,
that though he is rich, you are richer? and, doubtless,
you never took notice, that though he is handsome, you
are handsomer? As to manners, there is little to choose
between you, for he is as much too correct, as you are
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
too fantastic. In conversation, too, you are nearly upon
a par, for he is as regularly too right, as you are ridi∣culously
too wrong,—but O the charm of dear amusing
wrong, over dull commanding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>! you have but to
address yourself to her with a little slattering distinction,
and Mandlebert ever after will appear to her a pe∣dant.”</P>
<P>“What a wicked sort of sprite is a female wit!”
cried Sir Sedley, “breathing only in mischief! a very
will-o'-the-wisp, personified and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>oated▪ shining but

dulcinea, should I deliver her from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? You don't

protest I am shivered to the utmost point north at the
bare suggestion! frozen to an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!”</P>
<P>“No, no; I know you far too confirmed an egotist
for any thing but an old bachelor. Nor is there the
least necessity to yoke the poor child to the conjugal
plough so early. The only sacrifice I demand from you
is a little attention; the only good I aim at for her, is
to open her eyes, which have now a film before them,
and to let her see that Mandlebert has no other pre-emi∣nence,
than that of having been the first young man with
whom she became acquainted. Never imagine I want
her to fall in love with you. Heaven help the poor
victim to such a complication of caprice!”</P>
<P>“Nay, now I am full south again! burning with
shame and choler! How you navigate my sensations
from cold to heat at pleasure! Cooke was a mere river
waterman to you. My blood chills or boils at your com∣mand.
Every sentence is a new climate. You waft
me from extreme to extreme, with a rapidity absolutely
dizzying. A balloon is a broad-wheeled waggon to
you.”</P>
<P>“Come, come▪ jargon apart, will you make yourself
of any use? The cure of a romantic first flame is a better
surety to subsequent discretion, than all the exhortations
of all the fathers, and mothers, and guardians, and
maiden aunts in the universe. Save her now, and you
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
serve her for life;—besides giving me prodigious plea∣sure
in robbing that frigid Mandlebert of such a con∣quest.”</P>
<P>“Unhappy young swain! I pity him to immensity.
How has he fallen thus under the rigour of your wrath?
Do you banish him your favour, like another Aristides,
to relieve your ear from hearing him called the Just?</P>
<P>“Was ever allusion so impertinent? or, what is
worse, for aught I can determine▪ so true? for, certain∣ly,
he has given me no offence; yet I feel I should be
enchanted to humble him. Don't be concerned for him,
however; you may assure yourself he hates me There
is a certain spring in our propensities to one another,
that involuntarily opens and shuts in almost exact har∣mony,
whether of approbation or antipathy. Except,
indeed, in the one article of love, which, distinguishing
nothing▪ is ready to grasp at any thing.”</P>
<P>“But why have you not recourse to the gallant cock∣ade?”</P>
<P>“The Major? O, I have observed, already, she re∣ceives
his devoirs without emotion; which, for a girl
who has seen nothing of the world, is respectable
enough, his red coat considered. Whether the man
has any meaning himself, or whether he knows there is
such a thing, I cannot tell: but as I do not wish to see
her surrounded with brats, while a mere brat herself, it
is not worth inquiry. You are the thing, Clarendol,
the very thing! You are just agreeable enough to annul
her puerile fascination, yet not interesting enough to in∣volve
her in any new danger.”</P>
<P>“Flattering past imitability! divine Arlberiana!”</P>
<P>“Girls, in general,” continued she, “are insupport∣able
nuisances to women. If you do not set them to
prate about their admirers, or their admired, they die of

<P>Camilla here returned. She had written a few lines
to Eugenia, to enforce her reliance upon Edgar, with
an earnest request to be sent for immediately, if any new

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Recall.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER two days passed with tolerable, though not
natural cheerfulness at the Grove, Camilla was surprised
by the arrival of the carriage of Sir Hugh with a short
note from Eugenia.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Miss Camilla Tyrold.</OPENER>
<P>AN incident has happened that overpowers me with
sadness and horror. I cannot write. I send the cha∣riot.
O! come and pass an hour or two at Cleves with
your distressed</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>EUGENIA!</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Camilla could scarcely stop to leave a message for Mrs.
Arlbery, before she flew to the carriage; nor even in∣quire
for her uncle at Cleves before she ran to the apart∣ment
of Eugenia, and, with a thousand tender caresses,
desired to know what had thus cruelly afflicted her.</P>
<P>“Alas!” she answered, “my uncle has written to
Clermont to come over,—and informed him with what
view!”</P>
<P>She then related, that Indiana, the preceding day,
had prevailed with Sir Hugh to let her go to the Mid∣dleton
races; and she sound he would be quite unhappy
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
if she refused to be also of the party. That they had
been joined by Bellamy on the race ground, who only,
however, spoke to Miss Margland, as Edgar, watchful
and uneasy, scarce let him even see any one else. But
the horses having taken fright, while they were in a
great crowd, Bellamy had persuaded Miss Margland to
alight, while the coach passed a terrible concourse of car∣riages;
and, in that interval, he had contrived to whis∣per
a claim upon her tacit promise of viewing the chaise
which was for ever to convey him away from her; and,
though her engagement to Edgar made her refuse, he
had drawn her, she knows not herself how, from her
party, and, while she was angrily remonstrating, and
he seemed in the utmost despair at her displeasure, Ed∣gar,
who had been at first eluded by being on horse∣back,
dismounted, forced his way to her, and almost
carried her back to the coach, leaving Bellamy, who
she was sure had no sinister design, nearly dead with
grief at being unworthily suspected. Edgar, she how∣ever
added, was fixed in believing he meant to con∣vey
her away; and Jacob, asserting he saw him pur∣posely
frighten the horses, had told his surmises to Sir
Hugh; which he had corroborated by an account that
the same gentleman had stopt to converse with her in her
last return from Etherington. Sir Hugh, terrisied, had
declared he would no longer live without Clermont
upon the spot. She had felt too much for his distur∣bance
to oppose him at the moment, but had not imagin∣ed
his plan would immediately be put into execution,
till, early this morning, he had sent for her, and pro∣duced
his letter of recall, which had taken him, he said,
the whole night to compose and finish. Urged by sur∣prise
and dissatisfaction, she was beginning a little re∣monstrance;
but found it made him so extremely un∣happy,
that, in the fear of a relapse, she desisted; and,
with a shock she knew not when she should overcome,
saw the fatal letter delivered for the post.</P>
<P>Camilla, with much commiseration, inquired if she
had consulted with Edgar. Yes, she answered; and
he had extorted her permission to relate the whole
transaction to her father, though in a manner wide from
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
justice to the ill-fated Bellamy; whose design might be
extraordinary, but whose character, she was convinced,
was honourable.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose education, though private, had not,
like that of Eugenia, been secluded and studious, was
far less credulous than her sister, though equally artless.
She knew, too, with regard to this affair, the opinion of
Edgar, and to know and be guided by it was imper∣ceptibly
one. She declared herself, therefore, openly
against Bellamy, and made her motives consist in a com∣mentary
upon his proceedings.</P>
<P>Eugenia warmly defended him, declaring the judg∣ment
of Camilla, and that of all her friends, to be
formed in the dark; for that none of them could have
doubted a moment his goodness or his honour, had they
seen the distracted suffering that was marked in his coun∣tenance.</P>
<P>“And what,” cried Camilla, “says my father to all
this?”</P>
<P>“He says just what Edgar says: he is all that is
kind and good, but he has never beheld Bellamy—how,
then, should be know him?”</P>
<P>A message came now from Sir Hugh to Camilla, that
he would see her before she went, but that he was resting
at present from the fatigue of writing a letter. He sent
her, however, with his love, the foul copy, to amuse her
till she could come to him.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Clermont Lynmere Es{que}.
Dear Nephew,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had a very dangerous illness, and the doctors
themselves are all surprised that I recovered; but a
greater doctor than them was pleased to save me, for
which I thank God. But as this attack has made me
think more than ever I thought before, I am willing to
turn my thoughts to good account.</P>
<P>Now, as I have not the gift of writing, at which,
thank God, I have left off repining, from the reason of
its great troublesomeness in acquiring, I can't pretend
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
to any thing of a fine letter, but shall proceed to busi∣ness.</P>
<P>My dear Clermont, I write now to desire you would
come over out of hand; which I hope you won't take
unkind, foreign parts being no great pleasure to see, in
comparison of old England; besides which, I have
another apology to offer, which is, having a sine prize
in view for you; which is the more essential, owing to
some unlucky circumstances, in which I did not behave
quite as well as I wish, though very unwillingly; which
I mention to you as a warning. However, you have
no need to be cast down, for this prize will set all right,
and make you as rich as a lord, at the same time that you
are as wise as a philosopher. And as learning, though
I have the proper respect for it, won't serve to make
the pot boil, you must needs be glad of more substantial
fuel; for there's no living upon air, however you
students may affect to think eating mere gluttony.</P>
<P>Now, this prize is no other than your cousin Eugenia
Tyrold, whom I don't tell you is a beauty; but if you
are the sensible lad I take you for, you won't think the
worse of her for wanting such srail perfections. Be∣sides,
we should not be too nice amongst relations, for
if we are, what can we expect from the wide world?
So I beg you to come over with all convenient speed,
for fear of her falling a prey to some sharper, many such
being to be found; especially at horse-races, and so
forth.</P>
<CLOSER>I remain,
Dear nephew,
Your affectionate uncle,
<SIGNED>HUGH TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Eugenia, from motives of delicacy and of shame, de∣clined
reading the copy as she had declined reading the
letter; but looked so extremely unhappy, that Camilla
offered to plead with her uncle, and use her utmost in∣fluence
that he would countermand the recall.</P>
<P>“No,” answered she, “no! 'tis a point of duty and
gratitude, and I must bear its consequences.”</P>
<P>She was now called down to Mr. Tyrold. Camilla
accompanied her.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/>
He told her had gathered, from the kind zeal and
inquiries of Edgar, that Bellamy had certainly laid a
premeditated plan for carrying her off, if she went to
the races; which, as the whole neighbourhood was there,
might reasonably be expected.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with servour, protested such wickedness was
impossible.</P>
<P>“I am unwilling, my dear child,” he answered,
“to adulterate the purity of your thoughts and expec∣tations,
by inculcating suspicions; but, though nature
has blessed you with an uncommon understanding, re∣member,
in judgment you are still but fifteen, and in
experience but a child. One thing, however, tell me
candidly, Is it from love of justice, or is it for your
happiness you combat thus ardently for the integrity of
this young man?</P>
<P>“For my justice, Sir!” said she firmly.</P>
<P>“And no latent reason mingles with and enforces
it?”</P>
<P>“None, believe me! save only what gratitude dic∣tates.”</P>
<P>“If your heart, then, is your own, my dear girl, do
not be uneasy at the letter to Clermont. Your uncle
is the last man upon earth to put any constraint upon
your inclinations; and need I add to my dearest Eu∣genia,
I am the last father to thwart or distress them?
Resume, therefore, your courage and composure; be
just to your friends, and happy in yourself.”</P>
<P>Reason was never thrown away upon Eugenia. Her
mind was a soil which received and naturalized all that
was sown in it. She promised to look forward with
more cheerfulness, and to dwell no longer upon this agi∣tating
transaction.</P>
<P>Edgar now came in. He was going to Beech Park
to meet Bellamy. He was charged with a long message
for him from Sir Hugh; and an order to inform him
that his niece was engaged; which, however, he de∣clined
undertaking, without first consulting her.</P>
<P>This was almost too severe a trial of the duty and for∣titude
of Eugenia. She coloured, and was quitting
the room in silence: but presently turning back, “My
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
uncle,” she cried, “is too ill now for argument, and he
is too dear to me for opposition:—Say, then, just what
you think will most conduce to his tranquillity and re∣covery.”</P>
<P>Her father embraced her; Camilla shed tears; and
Edgar, in earnest admiration, kissed her hand. She re∣ceived
their applause with sensibility, but looked down
with a secret deduction from its force, as she internally
uttered, “My task is not so difficult as they believe I
touched as I am with the constancy of Bellamy—It is
not Melmond who loves me! it is not Melmond I re∣ject!—”</P>
<P>Edgar was immediately setting off, but stopping him
—“One thing alone I beg,” she said; “do not com∣municate
your intelligence abruptly. Soften it by assur∣ances
of my kind wishes.—Yet, to prevent any de∣ception,
any future hope—say to him—if you think it
right—that I shall regard myself, henceforward, as if
already in that holy state so sacred to one only ob∣ject.”</P>
<P>She blushed, and left them, followed by Camilla.</P>
<P>“If born but yesterday,” cried Mr. Tyrold, while
his eyes glistened, she could not be more perfectly free
from guile”</P>
<P>“Yet that,” said Edgar, “is but half her praise;
she is perfectly free, also, from self! she is made up of
disinterested qualities and liberal sensations. To the
most genuine simplicity, she joins the most singular phi∣losophy;
and to knowledge and cultivation, the most un∣common,
adds all the modesty as well as innocence of
her extreme youth and inexperience.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold subscribed with frankness to this just
praise of his highly-valued daughter; and they then con∣ferred
upon the steps to be taken with Bellamy, whom
neither of them scrupled to pronounce a mere fortune∣hunter.
All the inquiries of Edgar were ineffectual to
learn any particulars of his situation. He said he was
travelling for his amusement; but he had no recom∣mendation
to any one; though, by being constantly
well dressed, and keeping a shewy footman, he had con∣trived
to make acquaintance almost universally in the
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
neighbourhood. Mr. Tyrold determined to accom∣pany
Edgar to Beech Park himself, and there, in the
most peremptory terms, to assure him of the serious
measures that would ensue, if he desisted not from his
pursuit.</P>
<P>He then went to take leave of Camilla, who had been
making a visit to her uncle, and was returning to the
Grove.</P>
<P>He had seen with concern the frigid air with which
Edgar <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad bowed to her upon his entrance, and with
compassion the changed countenance with which she
had received his formal salutation. His hope of the
alliance now sunk; and so favourite a wish could not be
relinquished without severe disappointment; yet his
own was immaterial to him when he looked at Ca∣milla,
and saw in her expressive eyes the struggle of
her soul to disguise her wounded feelings. He now
regretted that she had not accompanied her mother
abroad; and desired nothing so earnestly as any means
to remove her from all intercourse with Mandlebert.
He seconded, therefore, her speed to be gone, happy
she would be placed where exertion would be indispen∣sable;
and gently, yet clearly, intimated his wish that
she should remain at the Grove, till she could meet
Edgar without raising pain in her own bosom, or excit∣ing
suspicions in his. Cruelly mortified, she silently
acquiesced. He then said whatever was most kind to
give her courage; but, dejected by her conscious failure,
and afflicted by the change in Edgar, she returned to
Mrs. Arlbery in a state of mind the most melan∣choly.</P>
<P>And here, nothing could be less exhilarating nor less
seasonable than the first news she heard.</P>
<P>The regiment of General Kinsale was ordered into
Kent, in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge: It was
the season for drinking the water of that spring; and Mr.
Dennel was going thither with his daughter. Sir Sed∣ley
Clarendel conceived it would be serviceable also to
his own health; and had suddenly proposed to Mrs.
Arlbery forming a party to pass a few weeks there.
With a vivacity always ready for any new project,
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
she instantly agreed to it, and the journey was settled
to take place in three days. When Camilla was in∣formed
of this intended excursion, the disappointment
with which it overpowered her was too potent for dis∣guise:
and Mrs. Arlbery was so much struck with it,
that, during coffee, she took Sir Sedley apart, and said;
“I feel such concern for the dismal alteration of that
sweet girl, that I could prevail with myself, all love∣lorn
as she is, to take her with me to Tunbridge, if
you will aid my hardy enterprise of driving that frozen
composition of premature wisdom from her mind. If
you are not as invulnerable as himself, you cannot refuse
me this sleight of gallantry.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley gave a laughing assent▪ declaring, at the
same time, with the strongest professed diffidence, his
conscious inability. Mrs. Arlbery, in high spirits,
said she scarce knew which would most delight her, to
mortify Edgar, or restore Camilla to gaiety and inde∣pendance.
Yet she would watch, she said, that mat∣ters
went no further than just to shake off a whining first
love; for the last thing upon earth she intended was to
entangle her in a second.</P>
<P>Camilla received the invitation with pleasure yet
anxiety: for though glad to be spared returning to
Cleves in a state of disturbance so suspicious, she was
bitterly agitated in reflecting upon he dislike of Edgar
to Mrs. Arlbery, the pains he had taken to prevent
her mingling with the society, and the probably final
period to his esteem and good-will, that would prove
the result of her accompanying such a party to a place
of amusement.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Youth of the Times.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Arlbery accompanied Camilla the next day
to Cleves, to ask permission of Mr. Tyrold for the ex∣cursion.
She would trust the request to none but her∣self,
conscious of powers of persuasion unused to re∣pulse.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was distressed by the proposition: he was
not satisfied in trusting his unguarded Camilla to the
dissipation of a public place, except under the wing of
her mother; though he felt eager to remove her from
Edgar, and rejoiced in any opportunity to allow her a
change of scene, that might revive her natural spi∣rits,
and unchain her heart from its unhappy subjec∣tion.</P>
<P>Perceiving him undetermined, Mrs. Arlbery called
forth all her artillery of eloquence and grace, to for∣ward
her conquest. The licence she allowed herself
in common of fantastic command, gave way to the more
feminine attraction of soft pleading: her satire, which,
though never malignant, was often alarming, was re∣linquished
for a sportive gaiety that diffused general
animation; and Mr. Tyrold soon, though not caught
like his daughter, ceased to wonder that his daughter
had been caught.</P>
<P>In this indecision he took Camilla apart, and bad
her tell her him, without fear or reserve, her own feel∣ings,
her own wishes, her own opinion upon this scheme.
She held such a call too serious and too kind for dis∣guise:
she hid her face upon his shoulder and wept;
he soothed and encouraged her to confidence; and,
in broken accents she then acknowledged herself un∣equal
as yet, to fulfilling his injunctions of appearing
cheerful and easy, though sensible of their wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78"/>
Mr. Tyrold, with a heavy heart, saw how much
deeper was her wound, than the airiness of her nature
had prepared him to expect, and could no longer he∣sitate
in granting his consent. He saw it was her
wish to go; but he saw that the pleasures of a public
place had no share in exciting it. To avoid betraying
her conscious mortification was her sole and innocent
motive; and though he would rather have sent her to
a more private spot, and have trusted her to a more
retired character; he yet thought it possible, that
what opportunity presented unsought, might, even∣tually,
prove more beneficial than what his own choice
would have dictated; for public amusements, to the
young and unhackneyed, give entertainment without
requiring exertion; and spirits lively as those of Mrs.
Arlbery create nearly as much gaiety as they display.</P>
<P>Fixed▪ now, for the journey, he carried Camilla
to her uncle to take leave. The prospect of not see∣ing
her again for six weeks was gloomy to Sir Hugh,
though he bore it better at this moment, when his fan∣cy
was occupied by arranging preparation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the re∣turn
of Clermont, than he could have done at almost
any other. He put into her hands a fifty pound Bank
note for her expences, and when, with mingled mo∣desty
and dejection, she would have returned the whole,
as unnecessary even to her wishes, Mr. Tyrold, inter∣fering,
made her accept twenty pounds. Sir Hugh
pressed forward the original sum in vain; his brother,
though always averse to refuse his smallest desire,
thought it here a duty to be firm, that the excursion,
which he granted as a relief to her sadness, might
not lead to pleasures ever after beyond her reach, nor
to their concomitant extravagance. She could not,
he knew, reside at Tunbridge with the economy and
simplicity to which she was accustomed at Etherington;
but he charged her to let no temptation make her for∣get
the moderate income of which alone she was certain;
assuring her, that where a young woman's expences
exceeded her known expectations, those who were fore∣most
to praise her elegance, would most fear to form
any connection with her, and most despise or deride her
in any calamity.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79"/>
Camilla found no difficulty in promising the most
exact observance of this instruction; her heart seemed
in sackcloth and ashes, and she cared not in what man∣ner
her person should be arrayed.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh earnestly enjoined her not to fail to be
at Cleves upon the arrival of Clermont▪ intimating that
the nuptials would immediately take place.</P>
<P>She then sought Eugenia, whom she found with
Dr. Orkborne, in a state of mind so perfectly calm and
composed, as equally to surprise and rejoice her. She
saw with pleasure that all Bellamy had inspired was the
most artless compassion; for since his dismission had
now positively been given, and Clermont was actually
summoned, she devoted her thoughts solely to the ap∣proaching
event▪ with the firm, though early wisdom
which distinguished her character.</P>
<P>Indiana joined them; and, in a low voice, said to
Camilla, “Pray, cousin, do you know where Mr.
Macdersey is? Because I am sadly afraid he's dead.”</P>
<P>Camilla, surprised, desired to know why she had such
an apprehension?</P>
<P>“Because he told me he'd shoot himself through
the brains if I was cruel—and I am sure I had no great
choice given me: for, between ourselves, Miss Marg∣land
gave all the answers for me, without once stopping
to ask me what I should chuse. So if he has really
done it, the fault is more her's than mine,”</P>
<P>She then said, that, just after Camilla's departure
the preceding day, Mr. Macdersey arrived, and insist∣ed
upon seeing her, and speaking to Sir Hugh, as he
was ordered into Kent, and could not go so far in sus∣pence.
Sir Hugh was not well enough to admit him;
and Miss Margland, upon whom the office devolved,
took upon her to give him a positive refusal; and
though she went into the room while he was there, never
once would let her make an answer for herself.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, she added, had frightened Sir Hugh
into forbidding him the house, by comparing him with
Mr. Bellamy; but Mr. Macderscy had frightened
them all enough, in return, as he went away, by saying,
that as soon as ever Sir Hugh was well, he would call
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
him out, because of his sending him word down stairs
not to come to Cleves any more, for he had been dis∣turbed
enough already by another Irish fortune-hunter,
that came after another of his nieces; and he was the
more sure Mr. Macdersey was one of them, because of
his being a real Irishman, while Mr. Bellamy was only
an Englishman. “But don't you think now, cousin,”
she continued, “Miss Margland might as well have let
me speak for myself?”</P>
<P>Camilla inquired if she was sorry for the rejec∣tion.</P>
<P>“N–o,” she answered, with some hesitation; “for
Miss Margland says he's got no rent-roll; besides, I
don't think he's so agreeable as Mr. Melmond; only
Mr. Melmond's worth little or no fortune they say: for
Miss Margland inquired about it, after Mr. Mandl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert
behaved so. Else I can't say I thought Mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmond
disagreeable.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now sent to hasten Camilla, who, in
returning to the parlour, met Edgar. He had just ga∣thered
her intended excursion, and, sick at heart, had
left the room. Camilla felt the consciousness of a guil∣ty
person at his sight; but he only slightly bowed; and
coldly saying, “I hope you will have much pleasure at
Tunbridge,” went on to his own room.</P>
<P>And there, replete with resentment for the whole of
her late conduct, he again blessed Dr. Marchmont for
his preservation from her toils; and, concluding the
excursion was for the sake of the Major, whose regi∣ment
he knew to be just ordered into Kent, he centered
every former hope in the one single wish that he might
never see her more.</P>
<P>Camilla, shocked by such obvious displeasure, quit∣ted
Cleves with still increasing sadness; and Mrs.
Arlbery would heartily have repented her invitation,
but for her dependance upon Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>At Etherington they stopt, that Camilla might pre∣pare
her package for Tunbridge. Mrs. Arlbery would
not alight.</P>
<P>While Camilla, with a maid-servant, was examining
her drawers, the chamber door was opened by Lionel,
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
for whom she had just inquired, and who, telling her
he wanted to speak to her in private, turned the maid
out of the room.</P>
<P>Camilla begged him to be quick, as Mrs. Arlbery was
waiting</P>
<P>“Why then, my dear little girl,” cried he, “the
chief substance of the matter is neither more nor less
than this: I want a little money.”</P>
<P>“My dear brother,” said Camilla, pleasure again
kindling in her eyes as she opened her pocket-book,
“you could never have applied to me so opportunely.
I have just got twenty pounds, and I do not want
twenty shillings. Take it, I beseech you, any part,
or all”</P>
<P>Lionel paused and seemed half choaked. “Ca∣milla,”
he cried presently, “you are an excellent girl.
If you were as old and ugly as Miss Margland, I
really believe I should think you young and pretty.
But this sum is nothing. A drop of water to the
ocean”</P>
<P>Camilla now, drawing back, disappointed and dis∣pleased,
asked how it was possible he should want
more.</P>
<P>“More, my dear child? why I want two or three
cool hundred.”</P>
<P>“Two or three hundred? repeated she, amazed.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, don't be frightened. My uncle will
give you two or three thousand, you know that. And
I really want the money. It's no joke, I assure you.
It's a case of real distress.”</P>
<P>“Distress? impossible! what distress can you have
to so prodigious an amount?”</P>
<P>“Prodigious! poor little innocent! dost think two or
three hundred prodigious?”</P>
<P>“And what is become of the large sums extorted
from my uncle Relvil?”</P>
<P>“O that was for quite another thing. That was
for debts. That's gone and over. This is for a per∣fectly
different purpose.”</P>
<P>“And will nothing—O Lionel!—nothing touch
you? My poor mother's quitting England—her sepa∣ration
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
from my father and her family—my uncle Rel∣vil's
severe attack—will nothing move you to more
thoughtful, more praise-worthy conduct?”</P>
<P>“Camilla, no preaching! I might as well cast my∣self
upon the old ones at once. I come to you in pre∣ference,
on purpose to avoid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rmonising. However,
for your satisfaction, and to sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r you to serve me, I
can assure you I have avoided all new debts since the last
little deposit of the poor sick hypocondriac miser, who
is pining away at the loss of a few guineas, that he
had neither spirit nor health to have spent for him∣self.”</P>
<P>“Is this your reasoning, your repentance, Lionel,
upon such a catastrophe?”</P>
<P>“My dear girl, I am heartily concerned at the whole
business, only, as it's over, I don't like talking of it.
This is the last scrape I shall ever be in while I live.
But if you won't help me, I am undone. You know
your in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luence with my uncle. Do, there's a dear girl,
use it for your brother? I have not a dependance in the
world▪ now, but upon you!”</P>
<P>“Certainly I will do whatever I can for you,” said
she, sighing; “but indeed, my dear Lionel, your man∣ner
of going on makes my very heart ach! However,
let this twenty pounds be in part, and tell me your very
smallest calculation for what must be added?”</P>
<P>“Two hundred. A farthing less will be of no use;
and three will be of thrice the service. But mind!—
you must not say it's for me!”</P>
<P>“How, then, can I ask for it?”</P>
<P>“O, vamp up some dismal ditty.”</P>
<P>“No, Lionel!” exclaimed she, turning away from
him; “you propose what you know to be impractica∣ble”</P>
<P>“Well, then, if you must needs say it's for me,
tell him he must not for his life own it to the old
ones.”</P>
<P>“In the same breath, must I beg and command?”</P>
<P>“O. I always make that my bargain. I should else
be put into the lecture room, and not let loose again till
I was made a milksop. They'd talk me so into the va∣pours,
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
I should not be able to act like a man for a month
to come.”</P>
<P>“A man, Lionel?”</P>
<P>“Yes, a man of the world, my dear; a knowing
one.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now sent to hasten her, and he extort∣ed
a promise that she would go to Cleves the next morn∣ing,
and procure a draft for the money, if possible, to
be ready for his calling at the Grove in the after∣noon,</P>
<P>She felt this more deeply than she had time or cou∣rage
to own to Lionel, but her increased melancholy
was all imputed to reflections concerning Mandlebert by
Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>That lady lent her chaise the next morning, with her
usual-promptitude of good-humour, and Camilla went to
Cleves, with a reluctance that never before accompani∣ed
her desire to oblige</P>
<P>Her visit was received most kindly by all the family,
as merely an additional leave taking; in which light,
though she was too sincere to place it, she suffered it
to pass. Having no chance of being alone with her
uncle by accident, she was forced to beg him in a whis∣per,
to request a <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> with her: and she then,
covered with all the confusion of a partner in his extra∣vagance,
made the petition of Lionel</P>
<P>Sir Hugh seemed much surprised, but protested he
would rather part with his coat and waistcoat than re∣fuse
any thing to Camilla▪ He gave her instantly a
draft upon his banker for two hundred pounds; but
added, he should take it very kind of her, if she would
beg <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionel to ask him for no more this year, as he was
really so hard run, he should not else be able to make
proper preparations for the wedding, till his next rents
became due.</P>
<P>Camilla was now surprised in her turn; and Sir
Hugh then confessed, that, between presents and peti∣tions,
his nephew had had no less than five hundred
pounds from him the preceding year, unknown to his
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
parents; and that for this year, the sum she requested
made the seventh hundred; without the least account
for what purpose it was given.</P>
<P>Camilla now heartily repented being a partner in a
business so rapacious, so unjustifiable, and so mysteri∣ous;
but, kindly interrupting her apology, “Don't
be concerned, my dear,” he cried, “for there's no
help for these things; though what the young boys
do with all their money now a-days, is odd enough,
being what I can't make out. However, he'll soon be
wiser so we must not be too severe with him; though
I told him, the last time, I had rather he would not
ask me so often; which was being almost too sharp,
I'm afraid, considering his youngness; for one can't ex∣pect
him to be an old man at once.”</P>
<P>Camilla gave voluntarily her word no such applica∣tion
should find her its ambassadress again: and
though he would have dispensed with the promise, she
made it the more readily as a guard against her own
facility.</P>
<P>“At least,” cried the baronet, “say nothing to my
poor brother, and more especially to your mother; it
being but vexatious to such good parents to hear of
such idleness, not knowing what to think of it; for it
is a great secret, he says, what he does with it all; for
which reason one can't expect him to tell it. My poor
brother, to be sure, had rather he should be studying
<HI>hic, haec, hoc;</HI> but, Lord help him! I believe he knows
no more of that than I do myself; and I never could
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke out much meaning of it, any further than it's be∣ing
Latin; though I suppose, at the time, Dr. Orkborne
might explain it to me, taking it for granted he did
what was right”</P>
<P>Camilla was most willing to agree to concealing from
her parents what she knew must so painfully afflict them,
though she determined to assume sufficient courage to
expostulate most seriously with her brother, against whom
she felt sensations of the most painful anger.</P>
<P>Again she now took leave; but upon re-entering the
parlour, found Edgar there alone.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85"/>
Involuntarily she was retiring; but the counsel of her
father recurring to her, she compelled herself to advance,
and say. “How good you have been to Eugenia! how
greatly are we all indebted for your kind vigilance and
exertion!”</P>
<P>Edgar, who was reading, and know not she was in
the house, was surprised, both by her sight and her ad∣dress,
out of all his resolutions; and, with a softness of
voice he meant evermore to deny himself, answered,
“To me? can any of the Tyrold family talk of being
indebted to me?—my own obligations to all, to every
individual of that name, have been the pride, have been
—hitherto—the happiness of my life!—'</P>
<P>The word “hitherto,▪ which had escaped, affected
him: he stopt, recollected himself, and presently, more
drily added “Those obligations would be still much in∣creased,
if I might flatter myself that one of that race,
to whom I have ventured to play the officious part of a
brother, could forget those lectures, she can else, I fear,
with difficulty pardon.”</P>
<P>“You have found me unworthy your counsel,” an∣swered
Camilla, gravely, and looking down; “you have
therefore concluded I resent it: but we are not always
completely wrong, even when wide from being right. I
have not been culpable of quite so much folly as not to
feel what I have owed to your good offices; nor am I
now guilty of the injustice to blame their being with∣drawn.
You do surely what is wisest, though not—
perhaps—what is kindest.”</P>
<P>To these last words she forced a smile; and, wishing
him good morning, hurried away.</P>
<P>Amazed past expression, and touched to the soul, he
remained, a few instants, immoveable; then, resolving
to follow her, and almost resolving to throw himself at
her feet he opened the door she had shut after her: he
saw her still in the hall, but she was in the arms of her
father and sisters, who had all descended, upon hearing
she had left Sir Hugh, and of whom she was now taking
leave.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86"/>
Upon his appearance, she said she could no longer
keep the carriage; but, as she hastened from the hall,
he saw that her eyes were swimming in tears.</P>
<P>Her father saw it too, with less surprise▪ but more
pain. He knew her short and voluntary absence from
her friends could not excite them: his heart ached with
paternal concern for her; and, motioning every body
else to remain in the hall, he walked with her to the car∣riage
himself, saying, in a low voice, as he put her in,
“Be of better courage, my dearest child. Endeavour
to take pleasure where you are going—and to forget
what you are leaving: and, if you wish to feel or to give
contentment upon earth, remember always, you must
seek to make circumstance contribute to happiness, not
happiness subservient to circumstance.”</P>
<P>Camilla, bathing his hand with her tears, promised
this maxim should never quit her mind till they met
again.</P>
<P>She then drove off.</P>
<P>“Yes,” she cried, “I must indeed study it; Edgar
cares no more what becomes of me! resentment next
to antipathy has taken place of his friendship and es∣teem!”</P>
<P>She wrote down in her pocket-book the last words of
her father; she resolved to read them daily, and to make
them the current lesson of her future and disappointed
life.</P>
<P>Lionel, too impatient to wait for the afternoon, was
already at the grove, and handed her from the chaise.
But stopping her in the portico, “Well,” he cried,
“where's my draft?”</P>
<P>“Before I give it you,” said she, seriously, and walk∣ing
from the servants, “I must entreat to speak a few
words to you.”</P>
<P>“You have really got it, then?” cried he, in a rap∣ture;
“you are a charming girl! the most charming girl
I know in the world! I won't take your poor twenty
pounds: I would not touch it for the world But come,
where's the draft? Is it for the two or the three?”</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
“For the two; and surely, my dear Lionel—”</P>
<P>“For the two? O, plague take it!—only for the
two?—And when will you get me the odd third?”</P>
<P>“O brother! O Lionel! what a question! Will you
make me repent, instead of rejoice, in the pleasure I
have to assist you?</P>
<P>“Why, when he was about it, why could he not as
well come down like a gentleman at once? I am sure I
always behaved very had somely to him.”</P>
<P>“How do you mean?”</P>
<P>“Why, I never frightened him; never put him be∣side
his poor wits, like t'other poor nuncle. I don't
remember I ever did him an ill turn in my life, except
wanting Dr. Pothook, there▪ to slog him a little for not
learning his book. It would have been a rare sight if
he had!—don't you think so?”</P>
<P>“Rare, indeed, I hope!”</P>
<P>“Why, now, what could he have done, if the Doc∣tor
had really performed it? He could not in justice
have found fault, when he put himself to school to him.
But he'd have felt a little queer. Don't you think he
would?”</P>
<P>“You only want to make me laugh▪ to prevent my
speaking to the purpose; but I am not disposed to laugh;
and therefore—”</P>
<P>“O, if you are not disposed to laugh, you are no
company for me. Give me my draft, therefore.”</P>
<P>“If you will not hear, I hope, at least, Lionel, you
will think; and that may be much more efficacious.
Shall I put up the twenty? I really do not want it. And
it is all, all, all I can ever procure you! Remember
that!”</P>
<P>“What?—all?—this all?—what, not even the other
little mean hundred?”</P>
<P>“No, my dear brother! I have promised my uncle
no further application—”</P>
<P>“Why what a stingy▪ fusty old codger, to draw such
a promise from you!”</P>
<P>“Hold, hold, Lionel! I cannot endure to hear you
speak in such a manner of such an uncle! the best, the
most benevolent, the most indulgent—”</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="88"/>
“Lord, child, don't be so precise and old maidish.
Don't you know it's a relief to a man's mind to swear,
and say a few cutting things when he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in a passion?
when all the time he would no more do harm to the
people he swears at, than you would that mince out all
your words as if you were talking treason, and thought
every man a spy that heard you. Besides, how is a man
the worse for a little friendly curse or two, provided he
does not hear it? It's a very innocent refreshment to a
man's mind, my dear; only you know nothing of the
world.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now approaching, he hastily took the
draft▪ and, after a little hesitation, the twenty pounds,
telling her, if she would not ask for him, she must ask
for herself, and that he felt no compunction, as he was
certain she might draw upon her uncle for every guinea
he was worth.</P>
<P>He then heartily embraced her; said she was the best
girl in the world, when she did not mount the pulpit,
and rode off.</P>
<P>Camilla felt no concern at the loss of her twenty
pounds: lowered and unhappy, she was rather glad than
sorry that her means for being abroad were diminished,
and that to keep her own room would soon be most con∣venient.</P>
<P>The next day was fixed for the journey.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Walk by Moonlight.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. ARLBERY and Camilla set off in the coach
of Mr. Dennel, widower of a deceased sister of the hus∣band
of Mrs. Arlbery, whom she was induced to admit
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
of the party that he might aid in bearing the expences,
as she could not, from some family considerations, re∣fuse
taking her niece into her coterie. Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel
drove his own phaeton; but, instead of joining
them, according to the condition which occasioned the
treaty, cantered away his ponies from the very first stage,
and left word, where he changed horses, that he should
proceed to the hotel upon the Pantiles.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was nearly provoked to return to the
Grove. With Mr Dennel she did not think it worth
while to converse; her niec▪ she regarded as almost an
idiot; and Camilla was so spiritless, that, had not Sir
Sedley acceded to her plan, this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as the last period in
which she would have chosen her for a companion.</P>
<P>They travelled very quietly to within a few miles of
Tunbridge, when an accident happened to one of the
wheels of the carriage that the coachman said would
take some hours to repair. They were drawn on, with
difficulty, to a small inn upon the road, whence they
were obliged to send a man and horse to Tunbridge for
chaises.</P>
<P>As they were destined, now, to spend some time in
this place, Mrs. Arlbery retired to write letters, and Mr.
Dennel to read newspapers; and, invited by a bright
moon, Camilla and Miss Dennel wandered from a little
garden to an adjoining meadow, which conducted them
to a lane, rendered so beautiful by the the strong masses
of shade with which the trees intercepted the resplen∣dent
whiteness of the moon, that they walked on, catch∣ing
fresh openings with fresh pleasure, till the feet of
Miss Dennel grew as weary with the length of the way,
unbroken by any company as the ears of Camilla with
her incessant prattling, unaided by any idea. Miss Den∣nel
proposed to sit down, and, while relieving herself by
a fit of yawning and stretching, Camilla strolled a little
further in search of a safe and dry spot.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel, following in a moment, on tip-toe, and
trembling, whispered that she was sure she heard a voice.
Camilla, with a smile, asked if only themselves were pri∣vileged
to enjoy so sweet a night? “Hush!” cried she,
“hush! I hear it again!” They listened; and, in a
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
minute, a soft plaintive tone reached their ears, too dis∣tant
to be articulate, but undoubtedly female.</P>
<P>“I dare say it's a robber!” exclaimed Miss Dennel
shaking; “If you don't run back, I shall die!”</P>
<P>Camilla assured her, from the gentleness of the sound,
she must be mistaken; and pressed her to advance a few
steps further, in case it should be any body ill.</P>
<P>“But you know,” said Miss Dennel, speaking low,
“people say that sometimes there are noises in the air,
without its being any body? Suppose it should be that?</P>
<P>Still, though almost imperceptibly, Camilla drew her
on, till, again listening, they distinctly heard the words,</P>
<P>“My lovely friend”</P>
<P>“La! how pretty!” said Miss Dennel; “let's go a
little nearer.”</P>
<P>They advanced, and presently, again stopping, heard,
“Could pity pour balm into my woes, how sweetly
would they be alleviated by your<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s my lovely friend?</P>
<P>Miss Dennel now looked enchanted, and eagerly led
the way herself.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, arriving at the end of the lan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
which opened upon a wild and romantic common, they
caught a glimpse of a figure in white.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel turned pale. “Dear!” cried she, in
the lowest whisper, “what is it?”</P>
<P>“A lady,” answered Camilla, equally cautious not to
be heard, though totally without alarm.</P>
<P>“Are you sure of that?” said Miss Dennel, shrink∣ing
back, and pulling her companion to accompany her.</P>
<P>“Do you think it's a ghost?” cried Camilla, unre∣sisting
the retreat, yet walking backwards to keep the
form in sight.</P>
<P>“Fie! how can you talk so shocking? all in the dark
so, except only for the moon?</P>
<P>“Your's, my lovely friend!” was now again pro∣nounced
in the tenderest accent.</P>
<P>“She's talking to herself?” exclaimed Miss Dennel;
“Lord, how frightful!” and she clung close to Camilla,
who, mounting a little hillock of stones, presently per∣ceived
that the lady was reading a letter.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91"/>
“Miss Dennel, tranquilised by hearing this, was
again content to stop, when their ears were suddenly
struck by a piercing shriek.</P>
<P>“O Lord! we shall be murdered!” cried she, scream∣ing
still louder herself.</P>
<P>They both ran back some paces down the lane, Ca∣milla
determining to send somebody from the inn to in∣quire
what all this meant: but presently, through an
opening to the common▪ they perceived the form in
white <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arting forwards▪ with an air wild and terrified.
Camilla stopt▪ struck with compassion and curiosity at
once; Miss Dennel could not quit her, but after the first
glance, hid h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> face, fai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly articulating, “O, don't let
it see us! don't let it see us! I am s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re it's nothing na∣tural!
I dare say it's somebody walking!</P>
<P>The next instant▪ they perceived a man, looking ear∣nestly
around▪ as if to discover who had echoed the
scream; the place they occupied was in the shade, and
he did not observe them. He soon rushed hastily on,
and seized the white garment of the flying figure, which
appeared, both by its dress and form, to be an elegant
female. She clasped her hands in supplication, cast up
her eyes towards heaven, and again shrieked aloud.</P>
<P>Camilla, who possessed that fine internal power of the
thinking and feeling mind to adopt courage for terror,
where any eminent service may be the result of imme∣diate
exertion, was preparing to spring to her relief;
while Miss Dennel, in extreme agony holding her, mur∣mured
out, “Let's run away! let's run away! she's
going to be murdered!” when they saw the man pros∣trate
himself at the lady's feet, in the humblest subjec∣tion.</P>
<P>Camilla stopt her flight; and Miss Dennel, appeased,
called out; “La! his kneeling! how pretty it looks!
I dare say it's a lover. How I wish one could hear
what he says!”</P>
<P>An exclamation, however, from the lady, uttered in
a tone of mingled affright and disgust, of “leave me!
leave me!” was again the signal to Miss Dennel of re∣treat,
but of Camilla to advance.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>
The rustling of the leaves, caused by her attempt to
make way through the breach, caught the ears of the
suppliant who hastily arose; while the lady folded her
arms across her breast, and seemed ejaculating the most
fervent thanks for this relief.</P>
<P>Camilla now forced a passage through the hedge, and
the lady, as she saw her approach, called out, in a voice
the most touching, “Surely 'tis some pitying Angel,
mercifully come to my rescue!”</P>
<P>The pursuer drew back and Camilla, in the gentlest
words, besought the la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to accompany her to the
friends she had just left, who would be happy to protect
her.</P>
<P>She gratefully accepted the propos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l, and Camilla
then ventured to look round▪ to see if the object of this
alarm had retreated: but, with an astonishment that al∣most
confounded her, she perceived him▪ a few yards
off, taking a pinch of snuff▪ and humming an opera air.</P>
<P>The lady, then, snatching up her letter, which had
fallen to the ground touched it with her lips, and care∣fully
folding, put it into her bosom tenderly ejaculating,
“I have preserved thee!—O from what danger! what
violation!”</P>
<P>Then pressing the hand of Camilla, “You have sav∣ed
me,” she cried, “from the calamity of losing what is
more dear than I have words to express! Take me but
where I may be shielded from that wretch, and what
shall I not owe to you?”</P>
<P>The moon now shining full upon her face, Camilla
saw seated on it youth, sensibility, and beauty. Her
pleasure, involuntarily rather than rationally, was re∣doubled
that she had proved serviceable to her as▪ in
equal proportion▪ was her abhorrence of the man who
had caused the disturbance.</P>
<P>The three females were now proceeding, when the
offender, with a careless air, and yet more careless bow,
advancing towards them, negligently said, “Shall I
have the honour to see you safe home, ladies?”</P>
<P>Camilla felt indignant; Miss Dennel again screamed;
and the stranger, with a look of horror and disgust,
said; “Persecute me no more!”</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93"/>
“O hang it! O curse it!” cried he, swinging his
cane to and fro, “don't be serious. I only meant to
frighten you about the letter.”</P>
<P>The lady deigned no answer, but murmured to her∣self
“that letter is more precious to me than life or
light!”</P>
<P>They now walked on; and, when they entered the
lane, they had the pleasure to observe they were not
pursued. She then said to Camilla, “You must be sur∣prised
to see any one out, and unprotected, at this late
hour; but I had employed myself, unthinkingly, in
reading some letters from a dear and absent friend, and
forgot the quick passage of time.”</P>
<P>A man in a livery now appearing at some distance,
she hastily summoned him, and demanded where was
the carriage?</P>
<P>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad, he answered, where she had left it, at
the end of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>She then took the hand of Camilla, and with a smile
of the utmost softness said, “When the shock I have
suffered is a little over, I must surely cease to lament I
have sustained it, since it has brought to me such sweet
succour. Where may I find you to-morrow, to repeat
my thanks?</P>
<P>Camilla answered, “she was going to Tunbridge im∣mediately,
but knew not yet where she should lodge.”</P>
<P>“Tunbridge!” she repeated; I am there myself; I
shall easily find you out to-morrow morning, for I shall
know no rest till I have seen you again.”</P>
<P>She then asked her name, and, with the most touch∣ing
acknowledgments took leave.</P>
<P>Camilla recounted her adventure to Mrs. Arlbery,
with an animated description of the fair Incognita, and
with the most heart-felt delight of having, though but ac∣cidentally,
proved of service to her. Mrs. Arlbery
laughed heartily at the recital, assuring her she doubted
not but she had made acquaintance with some dangerous
fair one, who was playing upon her inexperience, and ut∣terly
unfit to be known to her. Camilla warmly vindi∣cated
her innocence, from the whole of her appearance,
as well as from the impossibility of her knowing that her
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
scream could be heard: yet was perplexed how to ac∣count
for her not naming herself, and for the mystery of
the carriage and servant in waiting so far off These
latter she concluded to belong to her father, as she
looked too young to have any sort of establishment of
her own.</P>
<P>“What I don't understand in the matter is, that
there reading of letters by the light of the moon;” said
Mr. Dennel. “Where's the necessity of doing that,
for a person that can afford to keep her own coach and
servants?</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel was a man as unfavoured by nature as he
was uncultivated by art. He had been accepted as a
husband by the sister of Mr. Arlbery, merely on ac∣count
of a large fortune, which he had acquired in bu∣siness.
The marriage, like most others made upon such
terms, was as little happy in its progression as honour∣able
in its commencement; and Miss Dennel, born and
educated amidst domestic dissention, which robbed her
of all will of her own, by the constant denial of one
parent to what was accorded by the other, possessed too
little reflexion to benefit by observing the misery of an
alliance not mentally assorted; and grew up with no
other desire but to enter the state herself, from an ardent
impatience to shake off the slavery she experienced in
singleness. The recent death of her mother had given
her, indeed, somewhat more liberty; but she had not
sufficient sense to endure any restraint, and languished
for the complete power which she imagined a house and
servants of her own would afford.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hotel, in Tunbridge, Mrs.
Arlbery heard, with some indignation, that Sir Sedley
Clarendel was gone to the rooms, without demonstra∣ting,
by any sort of inquiry, the smallest solicitude at her
non-appearance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pantiles.</HEAD>
<P>A SERVANT tapt early at the door of Camilla,
the next morning, to acquaint her that a lady, who call∣ed
herself the person that had been so much obliged to
her the preceding day, begged the honour of being ad∣mitted</P>
<P>Camilla was sorry, after the suspicions of Mrs. Arl∣bery,
that she did not send up her name; yet, already
partially disposed, her prepossession was not likely to be
destroyed by the figure that now appeared.</P>
<P>A beautiful young creature, with an air of the most
attractive softness, eyes of the most expressive loveliness,
and a manner which by every look and every motion an∣nounced
a soul “tremblingly alive,” glided gently into
the room, and advancing, with a graceful confidence of
kindness, took both her hands, and pressing them to her
heart, said, “What happiness so soon to have found you!
to be able to pour forth all the gratitude I owe you, and
the esteem with which I am already inspired!”</P>
<P>Camilla was struck with admiration and pleasure;
and gave way to the most lively delight at the fortunate
accident which occasioned her walking out in a place
entirely unknown to her; declaring she should ever look
back to that event as to one of the marked blessings of
her life.</P>
<P>“If you,” answered the fair stranger, “have the
benevolence thus to value our meeting, how should it
be appreciated by one who is so eternally indebted to
it? I had not perceived the approach of that person.
He broke in upon me when least a creature so unge∣nial
was present to my thoughts. I was reading a let∣ter
from the most amiable of friends, the most refined—
perhaps—of human beings!”</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96"/>
Camilla, impatient for some explanation, answered,
“I hope, at least, that friend will be spared hearing
of your alarm?”</P>
<P>“I hope so! for his own griefs already overwhelm
him. Never may it be my sad lot to wound where I
mean only to console.”</P>
<P>At the words <HI>his own,</HI> Camilla felt herself blush.
She had imagined it was some female friend. She
now found her mistake, and knew not what to imagine
next.</P>
<P>“I had retired,” she continued, “from the glare of
company, and the weight of uninteresting conversation,
to read, at leisure and in solitude this dear letter—
heart-breaking from its own woes, heart-soothing to
mine! In a place such as this, seclusion is difficult.
I drove some miles off, and ordered my carriage to wait
in the high road, while I strolled alone upon the com∣mon.
I delight in a solitary ramble by moonlight. I can
then indulge in uninterrupted rumination▪ and solace
my melancholy by pronouncing aloud such sentences,
and such names, as in the world I cannot utter. How
exquisitely sweet do they sound to ears unaccustomed
to such vibrations!”</P>
<P>Camilla was all astonishment and perplexity. A
male friend so beloved, who seemed to be neither fa∣ther,
brother, nor husband; a carriage at her command,
though without naming one relation to whom either
that or herself might belong; and sentiments so ten∣der
she was almost ashamed to listen to them; all con∣spired
to excite a wonder that painfully prayed for re∣lief:
and in the hope to obtain it, with some hesita∣tion,
she said, “I should have sought you myself this
morning, for the pleasure of inquiring after your safety,
but that I was ignorant by what name to make my
search”</P>
<P>The fair unknown looked down for a moment, with
an air that shewed a perfect consciousness of the inquiry
meant by this speech; but turning aside the embarrass∣ment
it seemed to cause her, she presently raised her
head, and said, “I had no difficulty to find you,
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
for my servant, happily, made his inquiry at once at
this hotel.”</P>
<P>Disappointed and surprised by this evasion, Camilla
saw now an evident mystery, but knew not how to press
forward any investigation. She began, therefore, to
speak of other things, and her fair guest, who had
every mark of an education rather sedulously than na∣turally
cultivated, joined readily in a conversation less
personal.</P>
<P>They did not speak of Tunbridge, of public places,
nor diversions; their themes, all chosen by the stranger,
were friendship, confidence, and sensibility, which she
illustrated and enlivened by quotations from favourite
poets, aptly introduced and feelingly recited; yet al∣ways
uttered with a sigh, and an air of tender melan∣choly.
Camilla was now in a state so depressed, that
notwithstanding her native vivacity, she fell as imper∣ceptibly
into the plaintive style of her new acquaintance,
who seemed habitually pensive, as if sympathy rather
than accident had brought them together.</P>
<P>Yet when chance led to some mention of the adven∣ture
of the preceding evening, and the lady made again
an animated eulogium of the friend whose letter she was
perusing; she hazarded, with an half smile, saying:
“I hope—for his own sake, this friend is some sage and
aged personage?”</P>
<P>“O no!” she answered; “he is in the bloom of
youth.”</P>
<P>Camilla, again a little disconcerted, paused; and the
lady went on.</P>
<P>“It was in Wales I first met him; upon a spot so
beautiful that painting can never do it justice. I have
made, however, a little sketch of it, which, some day
or other, I will shew you, if you will have the goodness
to let me see more of you.”</P>
<P>Camilla could not refrain from an eager affirmative;
and the conversation was then interrupted by a message
from Mrs. Arlbery, who always breakfasted in her own
room, to announce that she was going out lodging∣hunting.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98"/>
Camilla would rather have remained with her new
acquaintance, better adapted to her present turn of mind
than Mrs. Arlbery; but this was impossible, and the
lovely stranger hastened away, saying she would call
herself the next morning to shew the way to her house,
where she hoped they might pass together many sooth∣ing
and consolatory hours.</P>
<P>Camilla sound Mrs. Arlbery by no means in her usual
high spirits. The opening of her Tunbridge campaign
had so far from answered its trouble and expence, that
she heartily repented having quitted the Grove. The
Officers either were not arrived in the neighbourhood,
or were wholly engaged in military business; Camilla,
instead of contributing to the life of the excursion,
seemed to hang heavily both upon that, and upon her∣self;
and Sir Sedley Clarendel, whose own proposition
had brought it to bear, had not yet made his appear∣ance,
though lodging in the same hotel.</P>
<P>Thus vexatiously disappointed, she was ill-disposed
to listen with pleasure to the history Camilla thought
it indispensable to relate of her recent visit: and in an∣swer
to all praise of this fair Incognita, only replied
by asking her name and connexions. Camilla felt ex∣tremely
foolish in confessing she had not yet learnt them.
Mrs. Arlbery, then laughed unmercifully at her com∣mendations,
but concluded with saying: “Follow,
however, your own humour; I hate to torment or
be tormented: only take care not to be seen with
her.”</P>
<P>Camilla rejoiced she did not exact any further re∣striction,
and hoped all raillery would soon be set aside,
by an honourable explanation.</P>
<P>They now repaired to the Pantiles, where the gay
company and gay shops afforded some amusement to
Camilla, and to Miss Dennel a wonder and delight▪
that kept her mouth open, and her head jerking from
object to object, so incessantly, that she saw nothing
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
distinctly, from the eagerness of her fear lest any thing
should escape her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, meeting with an old acquaintance in
the bookseller's shop, there sat down with him, while
the two young ladies loitered at the window of a toy∣shop,
struck with just admiration of the beauty and in∣genuity
of the Tunbridge ware it presented to their
view; till Camilla, in a party of young men who were
strolling down the Pantiles, and who went into the
bookseller's shop, distinguished the offender of the fair
unknown.</P>
<P>To avoid following, or being recollected by a per∣son
so odious to her, she entered the toy-shop with Miss
Dennel, where she amused herself, till Mrs. Arlbery
came in search of her, in selecting such various little
articles for purchase as she imagined would amount to
about half a crown; but which were put up for her at a
guinea. This a little disconcerted her: tho' as she was still
unusually rich, rom Mr. Tyrold's having advanced her
next quarterly allowance, she consoled herself that they
would serve for little keep-sakes for her sisters and her
cousin: yet she determined, when next she entered a
shop for convenience, to put nothing apart as a buyer,
till she had inquired its price.</P>
<P>The assaulter, Lord Newford, a young nobleman of
the <HI>ton,</HI> after taking a staring survey of every thing and
every body around, and seeing no one of more conse∣quence,
followed Mrs. Arlbery, with whom formerly
he had been slightly acquainted, to the toy-shop He
asked her how she did, without touching his hat; and
how long she had been at Tunbridge, without waiting
for an answer; and said he was happy to have the plea∣sure
of seeing her, without once looking at her.</P>
<P>To his first sentence, Mrs. Arlbery made a civil an∣swer;
but, repenting it upon the two sentences that suc∣ceeded,
she beard them without seeming to listen, and
fixing her eyes upon him, when he had done, coolly
said, “Pray, have you seen any thing of my ser∣vant?”</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100"/>
Lord Newford, somewhat surprised, replied, “No.”</P>
<P>“Do look for him, then,” cried she, negligently,
“there's a good man.”</P>
<P>Lord Newford, a little piqued, and a little confused
at feeling so, said he should be proud to obey her; and
turning short off to his companion, cried “Come, Offy,
why dost loiter? where shall we ride this morning?”
And, taking him by the arm, quitted the Pantiles.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, laughing heartily, now felt her spirits
a little revive; “I doat,” she cried, “upon meeting,
now and then, with insolence, I have a little taste for
it myself, which I make some conscience of not indulging
unprovoked.”</P>
<P>They then proceeded to the milliner's, to equip them∣selves
for going to the rooms at night. Mrs. Arlbery
and Miss Dennel, who were both rich, gave large or∣ders:
Camilla, indifferent to every thing except to
avoid appearing in a manner that might disgrace her
party, told the milliner to choose for her what she
thought fashionable that was most reasonable. She was
soon sitted up with what was too pretty to disapprove,
and desiring immediately to pay her bill, found it
amounted to five guineas; though she had imagined she
should have change out of two.</P>
<P>She had only six, and some silver; but was ashamed
to dispute, or desire any alteration; she paid the mo∣ney;
and only determined to apply to another person
than the seller, when next she wanted any thing rea∣sonable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now ordered the carriage, and they
drove to Mount Pleasant, where she hired a house
for the season, to which they were to remove the next
day.</P>
<P>In the evening, they went to the rooms, where the
decidedly fashionable mien and manner of Mrs. Arl∣bery,
attracted more general notice and admiration
than the youthful captivation of Camilla, or the pretty
face and expensive attire of Miss Dennel.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101"/>
Dressed by the milliner of the day, Camilla could
not fail to pass uncensured, at least, with respect to her
appearance; but her eyes wanted their usual lustre,
from the sadness of her heart, and she never looked less
herself, nor to less advantage.</P>
<P>The master of the ceremonies brought to her Sir
Theophilus Jarard; but as she had seen him the com∣panion
of Lord Newford, to whom she had conceived
a strong aversion, she declined dancing. He looked
surprised, but rather offended than disappointed, and
with a little laught, half contemptuous, as if ashamed
of having offered himself, stalked away.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley Clarendel was now sauntering into the
room. Mrs. Arlbery, willing to shew her young friend
in a favourable point of view to him, though more from
pique at his distance, than from any thought at that
moment of Camilla, told her she must positively accept
Sir Theophilus, whose asking her must be regarded as
a particular distinction, for he was notoriously a man of
the <HI>ton.</HI> And, heedless of her objections, told Mr. Den∣nel
to call him back.</P>
<P>“How can I do that,” said Mr. Dennel, “after see∣ing
her refuse him with my own eyes?”</P>
<P>“O, nobody cares about a man's eyes,” said Mrs.
Arlbery; “go and tell him Miss Tyrold has changed
her mind, and chooses to dance.”</P>
<P>“As to her changing her mind,” he answered,
“that's likely enough; but I don't see how it's any rea∣son
I should go of a fool's errand.”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho go directly; or you sha'n't dine before
eight o'clock for the whole Tunbridge season.”</P>
<P>“Nay,” said Mr. Dennel, who had an horror of late
hours, “if you will promise we shall dine more in rea∣son”—</P>
<P>“Yes, yes,” cried Mrs. Arlbery, hurrying him
off, notwithstanding the reiterated remonstrances of
Camilla.</P>
<P>“See, my dear,” she then added, laughing, “how
many weapons you must have in use, if you would go∣vern
that strange animal called man! yet never despair
of victory; for, depend upon it, there is not one of the
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
race that, with a little address, you may not bring to
your feet.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who had no wish but for one single votary,
and whose heart was sunk from her failure in obtaining
that one, listened with so little interest or spirit, that
Mrs. Arlbery, quite provoked, resolved not to throw
away another idea upon her for the rest of the even∣ing.
And therefore, as her niece went completely and
constantly for nothing with her, she spoke no more,
till, to her great relief, she was joined by General
Kinsale.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel returned with an air not more pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased
with his embassy, than her own appeared with her audi∣tress.
The gentleman, he said, had joined two others,
and they were all laughing so violently together, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he could not find an opportunity to deliver his mes∣sage,
for they seemed as it they would only make a joke
of it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then saw that he had got between Lord
Newford and Sir Sedley, and that they were all three
amusing themselves, without ceremony or disguise, at
the expence of every creature in the room; up and
down which they strolled, arm in arm, looking fami∣liarly
at every body, but speaking to nobody; whisper∣ing
one another in hoarse low voices, and then laugh∣ing
immoderately loud: while nothing was distinctly
heard, but, from time to time, “What in the world is
become of Mrs. Berlinton to night?” or else, “How
stupid the rooms are without lady Alithea?”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who, like the rest of the world, saw
her own defects in as glaring colours, and criticised
them with as much animated ridicule as those of her
neighbours, when exhibited by others, no sooner found
she was neglected by this set, than she raved against the
prevailing ill manners of the leaders in the <HI>ton,</HI> with as
much asperity of censure, as if never for a moment be∣trayed
herself, by fashion, by caprice, nor by vanity,
to similar foibles. “Yet, after all,” cried she present∣ly,
“to see fools behave like fools, I am well content.
I have no anger, therefore, against Lord Newford,
nor Sir Theophilus Jarard; if they were not noticed
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
for being impertinent, how could they expect to be no∣ticed
at all? When there is but one line that can bring
them forward, I rather respect them that they have
found it out. But what shall we say to Sir Sedley
Clarendel? A man as much their superior in capacity
as in powers of pleasing? 'Tis a miserable thing my
dear General, to see the dearth of character there is in
the world. Pope has bewailed it in women; believe
me, he might have extended his lamentation. You
may see, indeed, one man grave, and another gay;
but with no more “mark or likelihood,” no more dis∣tinction
of colouring, than what simply belongs to a dis∣mal
face or a merry one: and with just as little light and
shade, just as abrupt a skip from one to the other, as
separates inevitably the old man from the young one.
We are almost all, my good General, of a nature so
pitifully plastic, that we act from circumstances, and are
fashioned by situation.”</P>
<P>Then, laughing at her own pique, “General,” she
added, “shall I make you a confession? I am not at
all sure, if that wretched Sir Sedley had behaved as
he ought to have done, and been at my feet all the
evening, that I should not, at this very moment, be
amused in the same manner that he is himself! yet it
would be very abominable, I own.”</P>
<P>“This is candid, however.”</P>
<P>“O, we all acknowledge our faults, now; 'tis the
mode of the day: but the acknowledgment passes for
current payment; and therefore we never amend them.
On the contrary, they take but deeper root, by losing
all chance of concealment. Yet I am vexed to see that
odious Sir Sedley shew so silly a passion for being a man
of the <HI>ton,</HI> as to suffer himself to be led in a string by
those two poor paltry creatures, who are not more trou∣blesome
as fops, than tiresome as fools, merely because
they are better known than himself upon the turf and at
the clubs.”</P>
<P>Here, she was joined by Lord O'Lerney and the
honourable Mr. Ormsby. And, in the next saunter of
the <HI>tonnish</HI> triumvirs, Lord Newford, suddenly seeing
with whom she was associated, stopt, and looking at
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
her with an air of surprise, exclaimed, “God bless
me! Mrs. Arlbery! I hope you are perfectly well?”</P>
<P>“Infinitely indebted to your lordship's solicitude!”
she answered, rather sarcastically. But, without no∣ticing
her manner, he desired to be one in her tea-party,
which she was then rising to form.</P>
<P>She accepted the offer, with a glance of consciousness
at the General, who, as he conducted her, said: “I
did not expect so much grace would so immediately
have been accorded.”</P>
<P>“Alas! my dear General, what can one do? These
<HI>tonnish</HI> people, cordially as I despise them, lead the
world; and if one has not a few of them in one's train,
'twere as well turn hermit. However, mark how
he will fare with me! But don't judge from the open∣ing.”</P>
<P>She now made his lordship so many gay compliments,
and mingled so much personal civility with the general
entertainment of her discourse, that, as soon as they
rose from tea, he professed his intention of sitting by her,
for the rest of the evening.</P>
<P>She immediately declared herself tired to death of the
rooms, and calling upon Miss Dennel and Camilla,
abruptly made her exit.</P>
<P>The General, again her conductor, asked how she
could leave thus a conquest so newly made.</P>
<P>“I leave,” she answered, “only to secure it. He
will be piqued that I should go, and that pique will keep
me in his head till to-morrow. 'Tis well, my dear
General, to put any thing there! But if I had stayed
a moment longer, my contempt might have broken forth
into satire, or my weariness into yawning: and I should
then inevitably have been cut by the <HI>ton</HI> party for the
rest of the season.”</P>
<P>Miss Dennel, who had been dancing, and was again
engaged to dance, remonstrated against retiring so soon;
but Mrs. Arlbery had a regular system never to listen to
her. Camilla, whom nothing had diverted, was con∣tent
to retreat.</P>
<P>At the door stood Sir Sedley Clarendel, who, as if
now first perceiving them, said to Mrs. Arlbery, “Ah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
my fair friend!—And how long have you been at the
Wells?”</P>
<P>“Intolerable wretch!” cried she, taking him apart,
“is it thus you keep your conditions? did you draw me
into bringing this poor love-sick thing with me, only to
sigh me into the vapours?”</P>
<P>“My dear madam!” exclaimed he, in a tone of ex∣postulation,
“who can think of the same scheme two
days together? Could you possibly form a notion of any
thing so patriarchal?”</P>
<P>Before they retired to their chambers at the hotel,
Camilla told Mrs. Arlbery how shocking to her was
the sight, much more any acquaintance with Lord New∣ford,
who was the person that had so much terrified
the lady she had met on their journey. Mrs. Arlbery
assured her he should be exiled her society, if, upon
investigation, he was found the aggressor; but while
there appeared so much mystery in the complaint and the
conduct of this unknown lady, she should postpone his
banishment.</P>
<P>Camilla was obliged to submit: but scarce rested
till she saw again her new favourite the next morn∣ing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mount Ephraim.</HEAD>
<P>THIS expected guest arrived early. Camilla re∣ceived
her with the only sensation of pleasure she had
experienced at Tunbridge. Yet what she excited seem∣ed
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
still stronger: the fair stranger besought her friend∣ship
as a solace to her existence, and hung upon her as
upon a treasure long lost, and dearly recovered. Ca∣milla
soon caught the infection of her softness, and felt
a similar desire to cultivate her regard. She found her
beauty attractive, her voice melodious, and her man∣ners
bewitchingly caressing.</P>
<P>Fearing, nevertheless, while yet in ignorance of her
connections, to provoke further ridicule from Mrs.
Arlbery by going abroad with her, she proposed defer∣ring
to return her visit till another day: the lady con∣sented,
and they spent together two hours, which each
thought had been but two minutes, when Mrs. Arlbery
summoned Camilla to a walk.</P>
<P>The fair unknown then took leave, saying her ser∣vant
was in waiting; and Camilla and Mrs. Arlbery
went to the bookseller's.</P>
<P>Here, that lady was soon joined by Lord O'Lerney
and General Kinsale, who were warm admirers of her
vivacity and observations. Mr. Dennel took up the
Daily Advertiser; his daughter stationed herself at the
door to see the walkers upon the Pantiles; Sir Theo∣philus
Jarard, under colour of looking at a popular
pamphlet, was indulging in a nap in a corner; Lord
Newford, noticing nothing, except his own figure as
he past a mirror, was shuffling loud about the floor,
which was not much embellished by the scraping of his
boots; and Sir Sedley Clarendel, lounging upon a chair
in the middle of the shop, sat eating <HI>bon bons.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, for some time, confined her talents to
general remarks: but finding these failed to move a
muscle in the face of Sir Sedley, at whom they were
directed, she suddenly exclaimed: “Pray, my Lord
O'Lerney, do you know any thing of Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel?”</P>
<P>“Not so much,” answered his Lordship, “as I could
wish; but I hope to improve my acquaintance with
him.”</P>
<P>“Why then, my Lord, I am much afraid you will
conclude, when you see him in one of those reveries,
from the total vacancy of his air, that he is thinking
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
of nothing. But pray permit me to take his part.
Those apparent cogitations, to which he is so much
addicted, are moments only of pretended torpor, but
of real torment, devoted, not as they appear, to supine
insipidity, but to painful secret labour how next he may
call himself into notice. Nevertheless, my Lord, don't
let what I have said hurt him in your opinion; he is
quaint, to be sure, but there's no harm in him. He
lives in my neighbourhood; and, I assure your Lord∣ship,
he is, upon the whole, what may be called a very
good sort of man.”</P>
<P>Here she yawned violently; and Sir Sedley, unable
to maintain his position, twice crossed his legs, and
then rose and took a book: while Lord Newford burst
into so loud a laugh, that he awaked Sir Theophilus Ja∣rard,
by echocing, “A good sort of man! O poor Clary!—O
hang it!—O curse it!—poor C! lary!”</P>
<P>“What's the matter with Clary?” cried Sir Theophi∣lus,
rubbing his eyes; “I have been boring myself with
this pamphlet, till I hardly know whether I am awake
or asleep.”</P>
<P>“Why, he's a good sort of a man!” replied Lord
Newford.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though he expected, and even hoped for
some pointed strictures, and could have defied even
abuse, could not stand this mortifying praise; and, ask∣ing
for the subscription books, which, already, he had
twice examined, said: “Is there any body here one
knows?”</P>
<P>“Oh, ay, have you any names?” cried Lord New∣ford,
seizing them first; and with some right, as they
were the only books in the shop he ever read.</P>
<P>“Come, I'll be generous,” said Mrs. Arlbery, “and
add another signature against your Lordship's next lec∣ture.”</P>
<P>She then wrote her name, and threw down half-a-guinea.
Camilla, to whom the book was next present∣ed,
concluded this was the established custom, and, from
mere timidity, did the same; though somewhat dis∣turbed
to leave herself no more gold than she gave.
Miss Dennel followed; but her father, who said he did
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
not come to Tunbridge to read, which he could do at
home, positively refused to subscribe.</P>
<P>Sir Theophilus, now, turning, or rather, tossing over
the leaves, cried: “I see no name here one knows any
thing of but Lady Alithea Selmore.”</P>
<P>“Why, there's body else here,” said Lord Newford,
“not a soul!”</P>
<P>Almost every body present bowed; but wholly indif∣ferent
to reproof, he again whistled, again strolled up
and down the room, and again took a bold and full sur∣vey
of himself in the looking-glass.</P>
<P>“On the contrary,” cried Sir Sedley, “I hear there
is a most extraordinary fine creature lately arrived, who
is invincible to a degree.”</P>
<P>“O that's Mrs. Berlinton;” said Sir Theophilus;
“yes, she's a pretty little thing.”</P>
<P>“She's very beautiful indeed,” said Lord O'Ler∣ney.</P>
<P>“Where can one see her?” cried Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>“If she is not at the rooms to-night,” said Sir Sed∣ley,
“I shall be stupified to petrifaction. They tell me
she is a marvel of the first water; turning all heads by
her beauty, winning all hearts by her sweetness, fasci∣nating
all attention by her talents, and setting all fashions
by her elegance.”</P>
<P>“This paragon,” cried Mrs. Arlbery, to Camilla,
“can be no other than your mysterious fair. The de∣scription
just suits your own.”</P>
<P>“But my fair mysterious,” said Camilla, “is of a
disposition the most retired, and seems so young, I don't
at all think her married.”</P>
<P>“This divinity,” said Sir Sedley, “for the blessing
of every one, yet
<Q>Lord of Himself, uncumber'd by a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dryden.</NOTE>,</Q>
is safely noosed; and amongst her attributes are two
others cruel to desperation; she excites every hope by
a sposo prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly detestable—yet gives birth to despair,
by coldness the most shivering.”</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109"/>
“And what,” said Mrs. Arlbery, “is this Lady
Alithea Selmore?”</P>
<P>“Lady Alithea Selmore?” drily, but with a smile,
answered General Kinsale.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, that's not to be mentioned irreverently,”
returned Mrs. Arlbery; “a title goes for a vast deal,”
where there is nothing else; and, where there is some∣thing,
doubles its value.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel, saying he found, by the newspaper, a
house was to be sold upon Mount Ephraim, which pro∣mised
to be a pretty good bargain, proposed walking thi∣ther,
to examine what sort of condition it was in.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney inquired if Camilla had yet seen
Mount Ephraim. No, she answered; and a general
party was made for an airing. Sir Sedley ordered his
phaeton; Mrs. Arlbery drove Camilla in her's; Miss
Dennel walked with her father; and the rest of the gen∣tlemen
went on horseback.</P>
<P>Arrived at Mount Ephraim, they all agreed to alight,
and enjoy the view and pure air of the hill, while Mr.
Dennel visited the house. But, just as Mrs. Arlbery
had descended from the phaeton, her horses, taking
fright at some object that suddenly struck them, reared
up, in a manner alarming to the spectators, and still more
terrific to Camilla, in whose hands Mrs. Arlbery had
left the rein: and the servant, who stood at the horses'
heads, received a kick that laid him flat on the ground.</P>
<P>“O, jump out! jump out!” cried Miss Dennel, “or
else you'll be murdered!”</P>
<P>“No! no! keep your seat, and hold the reins!” cried
Mrs. Arlbery: “For heaven's sake, don't jump out!”</P>
<P>Camilla, mentally giddy, but personally courageous,
was sufficiently mistress of herself to obey the last in∣junction,
though with infinite labour, difficulty, and ter∣ror,
the horses plunging and flouncing incessantly.</P>
<P>“Don't you think she'll be killed?” cried Lord New∣ford,
dismounting, lest his own horse should also take
fright.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110"/>
“Do you think one could help her?” said Sir Theo∣philus
Jarard, steadily holding the bridle of his mare
from the same apprehension.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney was already on foot to afford her as∣sistance,
when the horses, suddenly turning round, gave
to the beholders the dreadful menace of going down the
steep declivity of Mount Ephraim full gallop.</P>
<P>Camilla now, appalled, had no longer power to hold
the reins; she let them go, with an idea of flinging her∣self
out of the carriage, when Sir Sedley, who had dart∣ed
like lightning from his phaeton, presented himself at
the horses' heads, on the moment of their turning, and,
at the visible and imminent hazard of his life, happily
stopt them while she jumped to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ground. They then,
with a fury that presently dashed the phaeton to pieces,
plunged down the hill.</P>
<P>The fright of Camilla had not robbed her of her
senses, and the exertion and humanity of Sir Sedley
seemed to restore to him the full possession of his own:
yet one of his knees was so much hurt, that he sunk
upon the grass.</P>
<P>Penetrated with surprise, as well as gratitude, Ca∣milla,
notwithstanding her own tremor, was the first to
make the most anxious inquiries: secretly, however,
sighing to herself: Ah! had Edgar thus rescued me!
yet struck equally with a sense of obligation and of dan∣ger,
from the horrible, if not fatal mischief she had es∣caped,
and from the extraordinary hazard and kindness
by which she had been saved, she expressed her concern
and acknowledgments with a softness, that even Sir Sed∣ley
himself could not listen to unmoved.</P>
<P>He received, indeed, from this adventure, almost
every species of pleasure of which his mind was capable.
His natural courage, which he had nearly annihilated,
as well as forgotten, by the effeminate part he was syste∣matically
playing, seemed to rejoice in being again ex∣ercised;
his good nature was delighted by the essential
service he had performed; his vanity was gratified by
the publicity of the praise it brought forth; and his
heart itself experienced something like an original feel∣ing,
unspoilt by the apathy of satiety, from the sensi∣bility
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
he had awakened in the young and lovely Ca∣milla.</P>
<P>The party immediately flocked around him, and he
was conveyed to a house belonging to Lord O'Lerney,
who resided upon Mount Ephraim, and his lordship's
carriage was ordered to take him to his apartment at the
hotel.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, whose high spirits were totally sub∣dued
by the terror with which she had been seized at
the danger of Camilla, was so delighted by her rescue,
and the courage with which it was effected, that all her
spleen against Sir Sedley was changed into the warmest
approbation. When he was put into the coach, she in∣sisted
upon seeing him safe to the hotel; Camilla, with
her usual inartificial quickness, seconding the motion,
and Lord O'Lerney, a nobleman far more distinguished
by benevolence and urbanity than by his rank, taking
the fourth place himself. The servant, who was con∣siderably
hurt, he desired might remain at his house.</P>
<P>In descending Mount Ephraim, Camilla turned giddy
with the view of what she had escaped, and cast her
eyes with redoubled thankfulness upon Sir Sedley as her
preserver. Fragments of the phaeton were strewed upon
the road; one of the horses laid dead at the bottom of
the hill; and the other was so much injured as to be to∣tally
disabled for future service.</P>
<P>When they came to the hotel, they all alighted with
the young baronet, Camilla with as little thought, as
Mrs. Arlbery with little care for doing any thing that
was unusual. They waited in an adjoining apartment
till they were assured nothing of any consequence was
the matter, and Lord O'Lerney then carried them to
their new lodging upon Mount Pleasant.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery bore her own share in this accident
with perfect good-humour, saying it would do her in∣finite
good, by making her a rigid oeconomist; for she
could neither live without a phaeton, nor yet build one,
and buy ponies, but by parsimonious savings from all
other expences.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112"/>
At night they went again to the rooms. But Mrs.
Arlbery found in them as little amusement as Camilla.
Sir Sedley was not there, either to attack or to flatter;
the celebrated Mrs. Berlinton still appeared not to un∣dergo
a scrutiny; and Lady Alithea Selmore sat at the
upper end of the apartment, attended by all the beaux,
except the General, now at Tunbridge.</P>
<P>This was not to be supported. She arose, and de∣claring
she would take her tea with the invalid, bid the
General escort her to his room.</P>
<P>In their way out, she perceived the assembly books.
Recollecting she had not subscribed, she entered her
name, but protested she could afford but half-a-guinea,
upon her present new and avaricious plan.</P>
<P>Camilla, with much secret consternation, concluded
it impossible to give less; and a few shillings were now
all that remained in her purse. Her uneasiness, how∣ever,
presently passed away, upon recollecting she should
want no more money, as she was now free of the rooms,
and of the library, and equipped in attire for the whole
time she should stay.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel put down a guinea; but her father, tel∣ling
her half-a-crown would have done, said, for that
reason, he should himself pay nothing.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley received them with the most unaffected
pleasure: forced upon solitude, and by no means free
from pain, he had found no resource but in reading,
which of late had been his least occupation, except the
mere politics of the day. Even reflection had disco∣vered
its way to him, though a long banished guest,
which had quitted her post, to make room for affect∣ation,
vanity, and every species of frivolity. Reduced,
however, to be reasonable, even by this short confine∣ment,
he now felt the obligation of their charitable visit,
and set his foppery and conceit apart, from a desire to
entertain them. Camilla had not conceived he had the
power of being so pleasantly natural; and the strong
feeling of gratitude in her ever warm heart made her
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
contribute what she was able to the cheerfulness of the
evening.</P>
<P>Some time after, General Kinsale was called out, and
presently returned with Major Cerwood, just arrived
from the regiment; who, with some apology to Sir Sed∣ley,
hoped he might be pardoned for the liberty he took,
upon hearing who was at the hotel, of preferring such so∣ciety
to the rooms.</P>
<P>As the Major had nothing in him either brilliant or
offensive, his sight, after the first salutations, was almost
all of which the company was sensible.</P>
<P>Camilla, his sole object, he could not approach; she
sat between the baronet and Mrs. Arlbery; and all her
looks and all her attention were divided between them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, emerging from the mortifications of ne∣glect,
which she had experienced, almost for the first
time in her life, at the rooms, was unusually alive and
entertaining; Sir Sedley kept pace with her, and the
discourse was so whimsical, that Camilla, amused, and
willing to encourage a sensation so natural to her, after
a sadness till now, for so long a time unremitting, once
more heard and welcomed the sound of her own laugh∣ter.</P>
<P>It was instantly, however, and strangely checked; a
sigh, so deep that it might rather be called a groan, made
its way through the wainscot of the next apartment.</P>
<P>Much raillery followed the sight of her changed coun∣tenance;
the hotel was pronounced to be haunted, and
by a ghost reduced to that plight from her cruelty. But
the good-humour and gaiety of the conversation soon
brought her again to its tone; and time passed with ge∣neral
hilarity, till they observed that Miss Dennel, who,
having no young female to talk with of her own views
and affairs, was thoroughly tired, had fallen fast asleep
upon her chair.</P>
<P>Her father was already gone home to a hot supper,
which he had ordered in his own room, and meant to
eat before their return; Mrs. Arlbery, to his great dis∣comfort,
allowing nothing to appear at night but fruit or
oysters.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114"/>
They now took leave, Mrs. Arlbery conducted by the
General, and Camilla by the Major; while Miss Dennel
unassisted and half asleep, stumbled, screamed, and fell,
just before she reached the staircase.</P>
<P>The General was first to aid her; the Major, not
choosing to quit Camilla; who looking round at a light
which came from the room whence the sigh they had
heard had issued, perceived, as it glared in her eyes, it
was held by Edgar.</P>
<P>Astonishment, pleasure, hope, and shame, took alter∣nate
rapid possession of her mind; but the last sensation
was the first that visibly operated, and she snatched her
hand involuntarily from the Major.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed, “Bless me, Mr. Mandle∣bert!
are you the ghost we heard sighing in that room
yonder?”</P>
<P>Mandlebert attempted to make some slight answer;
but his voice refused all sound.</P>
<P>She went on, then, to the carriage of Mr. Dennel,
followed by her young ladies, and drove off for Mount
Pleasant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Knowle.</HEAD>
<P>THE last words of Camilla to Mandlebert, in quit∣ting
Cleves, and the tears with which he saw her eyes
overflowing, had annihilated all his resentment, and left
him no wish but to serve her. Her distinction between
what was wisest and what was kindest, had penetrated
him to the quick. To be thought capable of severity
towards so sweet a young creature, the daughter of his
guardian, his juvenile companion, and earliest favourite,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
made him detestable in his own eyes. He languished
to follow her, to apologise for what had hurt her, and
to vow to her a fair and disinterested friendship for the
rest of his life: and he only forced himself, from de∣cency,
to stay out his promised week with the baronet,
before he set out for Tunbridge.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival, which was late, he went immedi∣ately
to the rooms? but he only saw her name in the
books, and learnt, upon inquiring for Mrs. Arlbery,
that she and her party were already retired.</P>
<P>Glad to find her so sober in hours, he went to the
hotel, meaning quietly to read till bed-time, and to call
upon her the next morning.</P>
<P>In a few moments, a voice struck his ear that effec∣tually
interrupted his studies. It was the voice of Ca∣milla.
Camilla at an hotel at past eleven o'clock! He
knew she did not lodge there; he had seen, in the
books, the direction of Mrs. Arlbery at Mount Plea∣sant.
Mrs. Arlbery's voice he also distinguished, Sir
Sedley Clarendel's, General Kinsale's, and, least of all
welcome,—the Major's.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, some lady, some intimate friend
of Mrs. Arlbery, was just arrived, and had made them
spend the evening there. He rang for his man, and
bid him inquire who had taken the next room,—and
learnt it was Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>To visit a young man at an hotel; rich, handsome,
and splendid; and with a <HI>chaperon</HI> so far from past her
prime, so elegant, so coquetish, so alluring, and still so
pretty; and to meet there a flashy Officer, her open
pursuer and avowed admirer—'Tis true, he had con∣cluded,
Tunbridge and the Major were one; but not
thus, not with such glaring impropriety; his love, he
told himself, was past; but his esteem was still suscep∣tible,
and now grievously wounded.</P>
<P>To read was impossible. To hold his watch in his
hand, and count the minutes she still staid, was all to
which his faculties were equal. No words distinctly
reached him; that the conversation was lively, the tone
of every voice announced, but when that of Camilla
struck him by its laughter, the depth of his concern
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
drew from him a sigh that was heard into the next
apartment.</P>
<P>Of this, with infinite vexation, he was himself aware,
from the sudden silence and pause of all discourse which
ensued. Ashamed both of what he felt and what he be∣trayed,
he grew more upon his guard, and hoped it
might never be known to whom the room belonged.</P>
<P>When, however, as they were retiring, a scream
reached his ear, though he knew it was not the voice
Camilla, he could not command himself, and rushed
forth with a light; but the lady who screamed was as
little noticed as thought of: the Major was holding the
hand of Camilla, and his eye could take in no more:
he saw not even that Mrs. Arlbery was there; and when
roused by her question, all voice was denied him for
answer; he stood motionless even after they had de∣scended
the stairs, till the steps of the General and the
Major, retiring to their chambers, brought to him some
recollection, and enabled him to retreat.</P>
<P>Fully now, as well as cruelly convinced, of the una∣bated
force of his unhappy passion, he spent the night in
extreme wretchedness; and all that was not swallowed
up in repining and regret, was devoted to ruminate upon
what possible means he could suggest, to restore to him∣self
the tranquillity of indifference.</P>
<P>The confusion of Camilla persuaded him she thought
she was acting wrong; but whether from disapprobation
of the character of the Major, or from any pecuniary ob∣stacles
to their union, he could not devise. To assist the
marriage according to his▪ former plan, would best, he
still believed, sooth his internal sufferings, if once he
could fancy the Major at all worthy of such a wife. But
Camilla, with all her inconsistencies, he thought a trea∣sure
unequalled: and to contribute to bestow her on a
man who, probably, only prized her for her beauty, he
now persuaded himself would rather be culpable than
generous.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, he could resolve only
upon a complete change of his last system; to seek, in∣stead
of avoiding her; to familiarise himself with her
faults, till he ceased to doat upon her virtues; to dis∣cover
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
if her difficulties were mental or worldly; to en∣force
them if the first, and—whatever it might cost him—to
invalidate them if the last.</P>
<P>This plan, the only one he could form, abated his
misery. It reconciled him to residing where Camilla
resided, it was easy to him, therefore, to conclude it
the least objectionable.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, in her way to Mount Pleasant,
spoke not a syllable. Dismay that Edgar should have
seen her so situated, while in ignorance how it had hap∣pened,
made an uneasiness the most terrible combat the
perplexed pleasure, that lightened, yet palpitated in
her bosom, from the view of Edgar at Tunbridge, and
from the sigh which had reached her ears. Yet, was
it for her he sighed? was it not, rather, from some se∣cret
inquietude, in which she was wholly uninterested,
and might never know? Still, however, he was at Tun∣bridge;
still, therefore, she might hope something re∣lative
to herself induced his coming; and she determin∣ed,
with respect to her own behaviour, to observe the
injunctions of her father, whose letter she would regu∣larly
read every morning.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, also, spoke not; the unexpected sight
of Mandlebert occupied all her thoughts; yet, though
his confusion was suspicious, she could not, ultimately,
believe he loved Camilla, as she could suggest no possible
impediment to his proclaiming any regard he entertain∣ed.
His sigh she imagined as likely to be mere lassi∣tude
as love; and supposed, that having long discovered
the partiality of Camilla, his vanity had been confound∣ed
by the devoirs of the Major.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel, therefore, was the only one whose
voice was heard during the ride; for now completely
awaked, she talked without cessation of the fright she
had endured. “La, I thought,” cried she, “when
I tumbled down, somebody threw me down on purpose,
and was going to kill me! dear me! I thought I should
have died! And then I thought it was a robber; and
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
then I thought that candle that come was a ghost! O
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a! I never was so frightened in my life!”</P>
<P>The next morning they went, as usual, to the Pan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles,
and Mrs. Arlbery took her seat in the booksel∣lers
shop, where the usual beaux were encountered;
and where, presently, Edgar entering, addressed to her
some discourse, and made some general inquiries after
the health of Camilla.</P>
<P>It was a cruel drawback to her hopes to see him first
thus in public: but the manner of Mrs. Arlbery at the
hotel, he had thought repulsive; he had observed that
she seemed offended with him since the rencounter at
the breakfast given for Miss Dennel; and he now wish∣ed
for some encouragement for renewing his rights to
the acquaintance.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though with the assistance of a stick he
had reached the library, was not sufficiently at his ease to
again mount his horse; a carriage expedition was there∣fore
agitated for the morning, and to see Knowle being
fixed upon, equipages and horses were ordered.</P>
<P>While they waited their arrival, Lady Alithea Sel∣more,
and a very shewy train of ladies and gentlemen,
came into the library. Sir Sedley, losing the easy, na∣tural
manner which had just so much pleased Camilla,
resumed his affectation, indolence, and inattention, and
flung himself back in his chair, without finishing a speech
he had begun, or listening to an inquiry why he stopt
short. His friends, Lord Newford and Sir Theophi∣lus
Jarard, shuffled up to her ladyship; and Sir Sedley,
muttering to himself life would not be life without being
introduced to her, got up, and seizing Lord Newford
by the shoulder, whispered what he called the height of
his ambition, and was presented without delay.</P>
<P>He then entered into a little abrupt, half articulated
conversation with Lady Alithea, who, by a certain toss
of the chin, a short and half scornful laugh, and a su∣percilious
dropping of the eye, gave to every sentence
she uttered the air of a <HI>bon mot;</HI> and after each, as re∣gularly
stopt for some testimony of admiration, as a fa∣vourite
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
actress in some scene in which every speech is ap∣plauded.
What she said, indeed, had no other mark
than what this manner gave to it; for it was neither
good nor bad, wise nor foolish, sprightly nor dull. It
was what, if naturally spoken, would have passed, as it
deserved, without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsure or praise▪ This manner,
however, prevailed not onl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon her auditors but her∣self,
to believe that something of wit, of <HI>finesse,</HI> of pe∣culiarity,
accompanied her every ph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase. Though,
properly speaking, there was none in any thing she pro∣nounced:
her speeches were all replies, which her ad∣mirers
dignified by the name of repartees, and which
mechanically and regularly flowed from some word, not
idea, that preceded.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, having listened some time, turned en∣tirely
away, though with less contempt of her ladyship
than of her hearers. Her own auditors, however, ex∣cept
the faithful General, had all deserted her. Even
the Major, curious to attend to a lady of some celebrity,
had quitted the chair of Camilla; and Edgar himself,
imagining, from this universal devotion, there was some∣thing
well worth an audience, had joined the group.</P>
<P>“We are terribly in the back ground, General!”
cried Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice. “What must be
done to save our reputations?”</P>
<P>The General, laughing, said, he feared they were
lost irretrievably; but added that he preferred defeat
with her, to victory without her.</P>
<P>“Your gallantry, my dear General,” cried she, with
a sudden air of glee, “shall be rewarded! Follow me
close, and you shall see the fortune of the day rever∣sed.”</P>
<P>“Rising then,” she advanced softly, and with an air
of respect, towards the party, and fixing herself just op∣posite
to Lady Alithea, with looks of the most profound
attention, stood still, as if in admiring expectation.</P>
<P>Lady Alithea, who had regar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed this approach as an
intrusion that strongly manifested ignorance of high life,
thought much better of it when she remarked the almost
veneration of her air. She deemed it, however, wholly
beneath her to speak when thus attended to; till, ob∣serving
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
the patient admiration with which even a single
word seemed to be hoped for, she began to pardon what
appeared to be a mere tribute to her fame; and upon
Sir Theophilus Jarard's saying, “I don't think we
have had such a bore of a season as this, these five
years;” could not refuse herself the pleasure of reply∣ing:
“I did not imagine, Sir Theophilus, you were
already able to count by lustres.”</P>
<P>Her own air of complacency announced the happi∣ness
of this answer▪ The company, as usual, took the
hint, and approbation was buzzed around her. Lord
Newford gave a loud laugh, without the least concep∣tion
why; and Sir Theophilus, after paying the same
compliment, wished, as it concerned himself, to know
what had been said; and glided to the other end of the
shop, to look for the word lustre in Entick's dictionary.</P>
<P>But this triumph was even less than momentary; Mrs.
Arlbery, gently raising her shoulders with her head, in∣dulged
herself in a smile that savoured yet more of pity
than derision; and, with an hasty glance at the General,
that spoke an eagerness to compare notes with him, hur∣ried
out of the shop; her eyes dropt, as if fearful to
trust her countenance to an instant's investigation.</P>
<P>Lady Alithea felt herself blush. The confusion was
painful and unusual to her. She drew her glove off and
on; she d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbed a highly scented pocket handkerchief
repeatedly to her nose; she wondered what it was
o'clock, took her watch in her hand, without recollect∣ing
to examine it; and then wondered if it would rain,
though not a cloud was to be discerned in the sky.</P>
<P>To see her thus completely disconcerted, gave a
weight to the mischievous malice of Mrs. Arlbery, of
which the smallest presence of mind would have robbed
it. Her admirers, one by one, dwindled away, with
lessened esteem for her talents; and, finding herself pre∣sently
alone in the shop with Sir Theophilus Jarard, she
said, “Pray, Sir Theophilus, do you know any thing
of that queer woman?”</P>
<P>The words <HI>queer woman</HI> were guides sufficient to Sir
Theophilus, who answered, “No! I have seen her,
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
somewhere, by accident, but—she is quite out of our
line.”</P>
<P>This reply was a sensible gratification to Lady Ali∣thea,
who, having heard her warmly admired by Lord
O'Lerney, had been the more susceptible to her ridi∣cule.
Rudeness she could have despised without emo∣tion;
but contempt had something in it of insolence; a
commodity she held herself born to dispense, not re∣ceive.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Arlbery arrived, laughing, at the bot∣tom
of the Pantiles, she found Edgar making inquiries
of the time and manner of drinking the mineral water.</P>
<P>Camilla heard him, also, and with deep apprehensions
for his health. He did not however look ill; and a se∣cond
sadness, not less deep, ensued, that she could now
retain no hope of being herself his inducement to this
journey.</P>
<P>But egotism was no part of her composition; when
she saw, therefore, the next minute, Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel
advance limping, and heard him ask if his phea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
were ready, she approached him, saying, “Will
you venture, Sir Sedley, in your pheaton?”</P>
<P>“There's no sort of reason why not,” answered he,
sensibly flattered; “yet I had certainly rather go as
you go!”</P>
<P>“Then that,” said Mrs. Arlbery, must be in Den∣nel's
coach, with him and my little niece here: and
then I'll drive the General in your phaeton”</P>
<P>“Agreed!” cried Sir Sedley, seating himself on
one of the forms; and then, taking from a paper some
tickets, added; “I want a few guineas”</P>
<P>“So do I!” exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery; “do you
“know where such sort of things are to be met with?”</P>
<P>“Lady Alithea Selmore has promised to disperse
some twenty tickets for the master of the ceremonies'
ball, and she commands me to help. How many shall
I give you?”</P>
<P>“Ask Mr. Dennel,” answered she negligently;
“he's the only pay-master just now.”</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122"/>
Mr. Dennel turned round, and was going to walk
away; but Mrs. Arlbery, taking him by the arm,
said, “my good friend, how many tickets shall Sir
Sedley give you?”</P>
<P>“Me! none at all.”</P>
<P>“O sie! every body goes to the master of the cere∣monies'
ball. Come, you shall have six. You can't
possibly take less.”</P>
<P>“Six! What should I do with them?”</P>
<P>“Why you and your daughter will use two, and four
you must give away.”</P>
<P>“What for?”</P>
<P>“Was ever such a question? To do what's proper
and right, and handsome and gallant.”</P>
<P>“O, as to all that, it's what I don't understand.
It's out of my way.”</P>
<P>He would then have made off; but Mrs. Arlbery,
piqued to succeed, held him fast, and said: “Come,
if you'll be good, I'll be good too, and you shall have
a plain joint of meat at the bottom of the table every
day for a fortnight.”</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel softened a little here into something like
a smile; and drew two guineas from his purse; but
more there was no obtaining.</P>
<P>“Come,” cried Sir Sedley, “you have canvassed
well so far. Now for your fair self.”</P>
<P>“You are a shocking creature!” cried she; don't
you know I am turned miser?”</P>
<P>Yet she gave her guinea.</P>
<P>“But the fair Tyrolda does not also, I trust, assume
that character?”</P>
<P>Camilla had felt very uneasy during this contest; and
now, colouring, said she did not mean to go to the
ball.</P>
<P>“Can you ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r expect, then,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
“to have a partner at any other? You don't know the
rules of these places. The master of the ceremonies
is always a gentleman, and every body is eager to shew
him every possible respect.”</P>
<P>Camilla was now still more distressed; and stam∣mered
out, that she believed the fewer balls she went
to, the better her father would be pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123"/>
“Your father, my dear, is a very wise man, and a
very good man, and a very excellent preacher: but what
does he know of Tunbridge Wells? Certainly not so
much as my dairy maid, for she has heard John talk of
them; but as to your father, depend upon it, the sole
knowledge he has ever obtained, is from some treatise
upon its mineral waters; which, very possibly, he can
analyse as well as a physician: but for the regulation
of a country dance, be assured he will do much better
to make you over to Sir Sedley, or to me.”</P>
<P>Camilla laughed faintly, and feeling in her pocket
to take out her pocket handkerchief, by way of some∣thing
to do, Mrs. Arlbery concluded she was seeking
her purse, and suddenly putting her hand upon her arm
to prevent her, said, “No, no! if you don't wish to
go, or choose to go, or approve of going, I cannot,
in sober earnestness, see you compelled. Nothing is so
detestable as forcing people to be amused. Come, now
for Knowle.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley was then putting up his tickets; but the
Major, taking one of them out of his hand, presented
it to Camilla, saying: “Let the ladies take their tick∣ets,
now, and settle with us afterwards.”</P>
<P>Camilla felt extremely provoked, yet not knowing
how to resist, took the ticket; but, turning pointedly
from the Major to Sir Sedley, said: “I am your debt∣or,
then, sir, a guinea—the smallest part, indeed, of
what I owe you, though all I can pay!” And she
then resolved to borrow that sum immediately of Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley began to think she grew handsomer every
moment: and, contrary to his established and systematic
inattention, upon hearing the sound of the carriages,
conducted her himself to Mr. Dennel's coach, which
he ascended after her.</P>
<P>Edgar, unable to withstand joining the party, had
ordered his horse during the deba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e about the tickets.</P>
<P>Lords O'Lerney and Newford, and Sir Theophilus
Jarard, and Major Cerwood, went also on horseback.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley made it his study to procure amusement
for Camilla during the ride; and while he humoured
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
alternately the loquacious folly of Miss Dennel, and
the under-bred positiveness of her father, intermingled
with both comic sarcasms against himself, and pointed
annotations upon the times, that somewhat diverted her
solicitude and perplexity.</P>
<P>She forgot them however, more naturally, in exa∣mining
the noble antique mansion, pictures, and cu∣riosities
of Knowle; and in paying the tribute that
taste must ever pay to the works exhibited there of Sir
Joshua Reynolds.</P>
<P>The house viewed, they all proceeded to the park,
where, enchanted with the noble old trees which ve∣nerably
adorn it, they strolled delightedly, till they
came within sight of an elegant white form, as far dis∣tant
as their eyes could reach, reading under an oak.</P>
<P>Camilla instantly thought of her moon-light friend;
but Sir Theophilus called out, “Faith, there's the di∣vine
Berlinton!”</P>
<P>“Is there, faith?” exclaimed Lord Newford, sud∣denly
rushing forward to satisfy himself if it were true.</P>
<P>Deeming this an ill-bred and unauthorised intrusion,
they all stopt. The studious fair, profoundly absorbed
by her book, did not hear his lordship's footsteps, till
his coat rustled in her ears. Raising then her eyes,
she screamed, dropt her book, and darting up, flew to∣wards
the wood, with a velocity far exceeding his own,
though without seeming to know, or consider, whether
her flight might lead her.</P>
<P>Camilla, certain now this was her new friend, felt
an indignation the most lively against Lord New∣ford,
and involuntarily sprung forward. It was evident
the fair fugitive had perceived none of the party but
him she sought to avoid; notwithstanding Lord New∣ford
himself, when convinced who it was, ceased his
pursuit, and seemed almost to find out there was such
a sensation as shame; though by various antics, of
swinging his cane, looking up in the air, shaking his
pocket handkerchief, and sticking his arms a-kimbo,
he thought it essential to his credit to disguise it.</P>
<P>Camilla had no chance to reach the flying beauty,
but by calling to her to stop; which she did instantly at
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
the sound of her voice, and, turning round with a look
of rapture, ran into her arms.</P>
<P>The Major, whose devoirs to Camilla always sought,
not avoided the public eye, eagerly pursued her. Ed∣gar,
cruelly envying a licence he concluded to result
from his happy situation, looked on in silent amaze;
but listened with no small attention to the remarks that
now fell from Mrs. Arlbery, who said she was sure this
must be the fair Incognita that Miss Tyrold had met
with upon the road; and gave a lively relation of that
adventure.</P>
<P>He could not hear without delight the benevolent
courage thus manifested by Camilla, nor without terror
the danger to which it might have exposed her. But
Lord O'Lerney, with an air of extreme surprise, ex∣claimed:
“Is it possible Lord Newford could give any
cause of alarm to Mrs. Berlinton?”</P>
<P>“Is she then, my lord, a woman of character?”
cried Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>“Untainted!” he answered solemnly; “as spot∣less,
I believe as her beauty: and if you have seen
her, you will allow that to be no small praise. She
comes from a most respectable family in Wales, and
has been married but a few months:”</P>
<P>“Married, my lord? my fair female Quixote as∣sured
me she was single.”</P>
<P>“No, poor thing! she was carried from the nursery
to the altar, and, I fear, not very judiciously nor hap∣pily.”</P>
<P>“Dear!” cried Miss Dennel, “i'n't she happy?”</P>
<P>“I never presume to judge,” answered his lordship,
smiling, “but she has always something melancholy
in her air.”</P>
<P>“Pray how old is she?” said Miss Dennel.</P>
<P>“Eighteen.”</P>
<P>“Dear! and married?—La! I wonder what makes
her unhappy!”</P>
<P>“Not a husband, certainly!” said Mrs. Arlbery,
laughing, “that is against all chance and probability.”</P>
<P>“Well, I'm resolved when I'm married myself, I
won't be unhappy.”</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126"/>
“And how will you help it?”</P>
<P>“O, because I'm determined I won't. I think it's
very hard if I may'nt have my own way when I'm
married.”</P>
<P>“'Twill at least be very singular!” answered Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>Camilla now returned to her party, having first con∣ducted
her new friend towards a door in the park
where her carriage was waiting.</P>
<P>“At length, my dear,” said Arlbery, “your fair
mysterious has, I suppose avowed herself?”</P>
<P>“I made no enquiry,” answered she, painfully look∣ing
down.</P>
<P>“I can tell you who she is, then, myself,” said Miss
Dennel; “she is Mrs. Berlinton, and she's come out
of Wales, and she's married, and she's eighteen.”</P>
<P>“Married!” repeated Camilla, blushing from inter∣nal
surprise at the conversations she had held with her.</P>
<P>“Yes; your fair incognita is neither more nor less,”
said Mrs. Arlbery, “than the honourable Mrs. Berlin∣ton,
wife to Lord Berlinton's brother, and, next only
to Lady Alithea Selmore, the first toast, and the reign∣ing
cry of the Wells for this season.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who had seen and considered her in almost
every other point of view, heard this with less of
pleasure than astonishment. When a further investiga∣tion
brought forth from Lord O'Lerney that her mai∣den
name was Melmond, Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed:
“O, then, I cease to play the idiot, and wonder! I
know the Melmonds well. They are all half crazy,
romantic, love-lorn, studious, and sentimental. One
of them was in Hampshire this summer, but so im∣mensely
“melancholy and gentleman-like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ben Johnson.</NOTE>,” that I
never took him into my society.”</P>
<P>“'Twas the brother of this young lady, I doubt not,”
said Lord O'Lerney; he is a young man of very
good parts, and of an exemplary character; but strong
in his feelings, and wild in pursuit of whatever excites
them.”</P>
<P>“When will you introduce me to your new friend,
Miss Tyrold?” said Mrs. Arlbery; “or, rather,” (turn∣ing
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
to Lord Newford,) “I hope your lordship will do
me that honour; I hear you are very kind to her; and
take much care to convince her of the ill effects and
danger of the evening air.”</P>
<P>“O hang it! O curse it!” cried his lordship; “why
does a woman walk by moon-light?”</P>
<P>“Why, rather, should man,” said Lord O'Lerney,
“impede so natural a recreation?”</P>
<P>The age of Lord O'Lerney, which more than
doubled that of Lord Newford, made this question
supported, and even drew forth the condescension of an
attempted exculpation. “I vow, my lord,” he cried,
“I had no intention but to look at a letter; and that
I thought, she only read in public to excite curiosity.”</P>
<P>“O but you knelt to her!” cried Miss Dennel,
“you knelt to her! I saw you! and why did you do
that, when you knew she was married, and you could
not be her lover?”</P>
<P>The party being now disposed to return to the
Wells, Mrs. Arlbery called upon the General to
attend her to the phaeton. Camilla, impatient to
pay Sir Sedley, followed to speak to her; but, not
aware of her wish, Mrs. Alberly hurried laughingly
on, saying, “Come, General, let us be gone, that
the coach may be last, and then Dennel must pay the
fees! That will be a good guinea towards my ponies!”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mount Pleasant.</HEAD>
<P>THE shame and distress natural to every unhackney∣ed
mind, in any necessity of soliciting a pecuiary fa∣vour,
had now, in that of Camilla, the additional dif∣ficulty
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
of coping against the avowed desire of Mrs.
Arlbery not to open her purse.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Mount Pleasant, she saw all
the horsemen alighted, and in conversation with that
lady; and Edgar move towards the carriage, palpably
with a design to hand her out: but as the Major ad∣vanced,
he retreated, and, finding himself unnoticed
by Mrs. Arlbery, remounted his horse. Provoked and
chagrined, she sprung forward alone, and when pur∣sued
by the Major, with some of his usual compliments,
turned from him impatiently and went up stairs.</P>
<P>Intent in thinking only of Edgar, she was not her∣self
aware of this abruptness, till Mrs. Arlbery, fol∣lowing
her to her chamber, said, Why were you so
suddenly haughty to the Major, my dear Miss Tyrold?
Has he offended you?”</P>
<P>Much surprised, she answered, no; but forced by
further questions, to be more explicit, confessed she
wished to distance him, as his behaviour had been re∣marked.</P>
<P>“Remarked! how? by whom?”</P>
<P>She coloured, and was again hardly pressed before
she answered, “Mr. Mandlebert—once—named it to
me.”</P>
<P>“O, ho, did he?” said Mrs. Arlbery, surprised in
her turn; “why then, my dear, depend upon it, he
loves you himself.”</P>
<P>“Me!—Mr. Mandlebert!—” exclaimed Camilla,
doubting what she heard.</P>
<P>“Nay, why not”</P>
<P>“Why not?” repeated she in an excess or perturba∣tion;
“O, he is too good! too excelling! he sees all
my faults—points them out himself—”</P>
<P>“Does he?”—said Mrs. Arlbery thoughtfully, and
pausing: “nay, then,—if so—he wishes to marry
you!”</P>
<P>▪Me, ma'am!” cried Camilla, blushing high with
mingled delight at the idea, and displeasure at its free
expression.</P>
<P>“Why, else, should he caution you against ano∣ther?”</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129"/>
“From goodness, from kindness, from genero∣sity!—”</P>
<P>“No, no; those are not the characteristics of young
men who counsel young women! We all heard he was
engaged to your beautiful vacant-looking cousin; but I
suppose he grew sick of her. A very young man sel∣dom
likes a silly wife. It is generally when he is fur∣ther
advanced in life that he takes that depraved taste.
He then flatters himself a fool will be easier to govern.”</P>
<P>She now went away to dress; leaving Camilla a new
creature; changed in all her hopes, though over∣whelmed
with shame at the freedom of this attack,
and determined to exert her utmost strength of mind,
not to expose to view the secret pleasure with which it
filled her.</P>
<P>She was, however, so absent when they met again,
that Mrs. Arlbery, shaking her head, faid: “Ah,
my fair friend! what have you been thinking of?”</P>
<P>Excessively ashamed, she endeavoured to brighten
up. The General and Sir Sedley had been invited to
dinner. The latter was engaged in the evening to
Lady Alithea Selmore, who gave tea at her own lodg∣ings.
“The rooms, then, will be quite empty,” said
Mrs. Arlbery; “so we had better go to the play.”</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel had no objection, and Sir Sedley pro∣mised
to attend them, as it would be time enough for
her ladyship afterwards.</P>
<P>So completely was Camilla absorbed in her new
ideas, that she forgot both her borrowed guinea, and
the state of her purse, till she arrived at the theatre.
The recollection was then too late; and she had no re∣source
against completely emptying it.</P>
<P>She was too happy however, at this instant, to admit
any regret. The sagacity of Mrs. Arlbery she thought
infallible; and the sight of Edgar in a box just facing
her, banished every other consideration.</P>
<P>The theatre was almost without company. The as∣sembly
at Lady Alithea Selmore's had made it unfashi∣onable,
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
and when the play was over, Edgar found easily
a place in the box.</P>
<P>Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard looked in
just after, and affected not to know the piece was begun.
Sir Sedley retired to his toilette, and Mr. Dennel to
seek his carriage.</P>
<P>Some bills now got into the box, and were read by
Sir Theophilus, announcing a superb exhibition of
wild beasts for the next day, consisting chiefly of mon∣kies
who could perform various feats, and a famous
ourang outang, just landed from Africa.</P>
<P>Lord Newford said he would go if he had but two
more days to live. Sir Theophilus echoed him. Mr.
Dennel expressed some curiosity; Miss Dennel, though
she protested she should be frightened out of her wits,
said she would not stay at home; Mrs. Arlbery con∣fessed
it would be an amusing sight to see so many repre∣sentations
of the dear human race; but Camilla spoke
not: and scarce heard even the subject of discourse.</P>
<P>“You,” cried the Major, addressing her, “will be
there?”</P>
<P>“Where?” demanded she.</P>
<P>“To see this curious collection of animals.”</P>
<P>“It will be curious, undoubtedly,” said Edgar,
pleased that she made no answer; “but 'tis a species
of curiosity not likely to attract the most elegant spec∣tators;
and rather, perhaps, adapted to give pleasure
to naturalists, than to young ladies.”</P>
<P>Softened, at this moment, in every feeling of her
heart towards Edgar, she turned to him, and said,
“Do you think it would be wrong to go?”</P>
<P>“Wrong” repeated he, surprised though gratified,
“is perhaps too hard a word; but, I fear, at an itine∣rant
show, such as this, a young lady would run some
chance of finding herself in a neighbourhood that might
seem rather strange to her.”</P>
<P>“Most certainly then,” cried she, with quickness,
“I will not go!”</P>
<P>The astonished Edgar looked at her with earnestness,
and saw the simplicity of sincerity on her countenance.
He looked then at the Major; who, accustomed to
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
frequent failures in his solicitations, exhibited no
change of features. Again he looked at Camilla, and
her eyes met his with a sweetness of expression that pas∣sed
straight to his heart.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now led the way to the coach; the for∣wardness
of the Major, though in her own despight,
procured him the hand of Camilla; but she had left
upon Edgar an impression renovating to all his esteem.
She is still, he thought, the same; candid, open, flexi∣ble;
still, therefore, let me follow, her, with such
counsel as I am able to give. She has accused me of
unkindness;—She was right! I retreated from her
service at the moment when, in honour, I was bound to
continue in it. How selfish was such conduct! how like
such common love as seeks only its own gratification,
not the happiness or welfare of its object! Could she,
though but lately so dear to me, that all the felicity of
my life seemed to hang upon her, become as nothing,
because destined to another? No! Her father has been
my father, and so long as she retains his respected name,
I will watch by her unceasingly.</P>
<P>In their way home, one of the horses tired, and
could not be made to drag the carriage up to Mount
Pleasant. They were therefore obliged to alight and
walk. Mrs. Arlbery took the arm of Mr. Dennel,
which she did not spare, and his daughter, almost cry∣ing
with sleep and fatigue, made the same use of Ca∣milla's
She protested she had never been so long upon
her feet in her life as that very morning in Knowle
Park, and, though she leant upon her companion with
as little scruple as upon a walking stick, she frequently
stopt short, and declared she should stay upon the road
all night, for she could not move another step: and
they were still far from the summit, when she insisted
upon sitting down, saying fretfully, “I am sure I wish
I was married! Nobody minds me. I am sure if I
was, I would not be served so. I'm resolved I'll al∣ways
have two coaches, one to come after me, and
one to ride in; for I'm determined I won't marry a
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
man that has not a great fortune. I'm sure papa
could afford it too, if he'd a mind; only he
won't. Every body vexes me. I'm sure I'm ready
to cry!”</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel and Mrs. Arlbery, who neither of them,
at any time, took the smallest notice of what she said,
passed on, and left the whole weight both of her per∣son
and her complaints to Camilla. The latter, how∣ever,
now reached the ears of a fat, tidy, neat looking
elderly woman, who, in a large black bonnet, and a
blue checked apron, was going their way; she approach∣ed
them, and in a good-humoured voice, said:—
“What! poor dear! why you seem tired to death?
come, get up, my dear; be of good heart, and you
shall hold by my arm; for that t'other poor thing's al∣most
hauled to pieces.”</P>
<P>Miss Dennel accepted both the pity and the pro∣posal;
and the substantial arm of her new friend, gave
her far superior aid to the slight one of Camilla.</P>
<P>“Well, and how did you like the play, my dears?”
cried the woman.</P>
<P>“La!” said Miss Dennel, “how should you know
we were at the play?”</P>
<P>“O, I have a little bird,” answered she, sagaciously
nodding, “that tells me every thing! you sat in the
stage box?”</P>
<P>“Dear! so we did! How can you tell that? Was
you in the gallery?”</P>
<P>“No, my dear, nor yet in the pit neither. And you
had three gentlemen behind you, besides that gentleman
that's going up the Mount?”</P>
<P>“Dear! So we had! But how do you know? did
you peep at us behind the scenes?”</P>
<P>“No, my dear; I never went behind the scenes.
But come, I hope you'll do now, for you ha'n't much
further to go.”</P>
<P>“Dear! how do you know that?”</P>
<P>“Because you live at that pretty house, there, up
Mount Pleasant, that's got the little closet window.”</P>
<P>“La, yes! who told you so?”</P>
<P>“And there's a pretty cat belonging to the house,
all streaked brown and black?”</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133"/>
“O, la!” exclaimed Miss Dennel, half screaming,
and letting go her arm, “I dare say you're a fortune∣teller!
Pray don't speak to me till we get to the
light!”</P>
<P>She now hung back, so terrified that neither Ca∣milla
could encourage, nor the woman appease her; and
she was going to run down the hill, forgetting all her
weariness, to seek refuge from the servants, when the
woman said, “Why what's here to do? Why see, my
dear, if I must let you into the secret,—you must
know—but don't tell it to the world!—I'm a gentle∣woman!”
She then removed her checked apron,
and shewed a white muslin one, embroidered and
flounced.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel was now struck with a surprise, of which
Camilla bore an equal share. Their new acquaintance
appeared herself in some confusion, but having exacted
a promise not to be discovered to <HI>the world,</HI> she told
them, she todged at a house upon Mount Pleasant, just
by their's, whence she often saw them; that, having
a ticket given her, by a friend, for the play, she
dressed herself and went into a box, with some very
genteel company, who kept their coach, and who sat
her down afterwards at another friend's, where she
pretended she should be fetched: “But I do my own
way,” continued she, `and nobody knows a word of
the matter: for I keep a large bonnet, and cloak, and
a checked apron, and a pair of clogs, or pattens, al∣ways
at this friend's; and then when I have put them
on, people take me for a mere common person, and I
walk on, ever so late, and nobody speaks to me; and
so by that means I get my pleasure, and save my mo∣ney;
and yet always appear like a gentlewoman when
I'm known.”</P>
<P>She then again charged them to be discreet, saying
that if this were spread to <HI>the world,</HI> she should be quite
undone, for many ladies that took her about with them,
would notice her no more. At the same time, as she
wished to make acquaintance with such pretty young
ladies, she proposed that they should all three meet in
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
a walk before the house, the next morning, and talk to∣gether
as if for the first time.</P>
<P>Camilla, who de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested all tricks, declined entering
into this engagement; but Miss Dennel, charmed with
the ingenuity of her new acquaintance, accepted the
appointment.</P>
<P>Camilla had, however, her own new friend for the
opening of the next day. “Ah! my sweet protectress!”
cried she, throwing her arms about her neck, “what
am I not destined to owe you? The very sight of that
man is horror to me. Amiable, generous creature!
what a sight was yours, when turning round, I met
your eyes, and beheld him no more!”</P>
<P>“Your alarm, at which I cannot wonder,” said Ca∣milla,
“prevented your seeing your safety; for Lord
Newford was with a large party.”</P>
<P>“O, he is obnoxious to my view! wherever I may
see him, in public or in private, I shall fly him. He
would have torn from me the loved characters of my
heart's best correspondent!—”</P>
<P>Camilla now felt a little shocked, and colouring and
interrupting her, said: “Is it possible, Mrs. Berlin∣ton—”
and stopt not knowing how to go on.</P>
<P>“Ah! you know me, then! You know my con∣nexions
and my situation!” cried she, hiding her face
on Camilla's bosom: “tell me, at least, tell me, you
do not therefore contemn and abhor me?”</P>
<P>“Heaven forbid!” said Camilla, terrified at such a
preparation; “what can I hear that can give you so
cruel an idea?”</P>
<P>“Alas! know you not I have prophaned at the altar
my plighted vows to the most odious of men? That I
have formed an alliance I despise? and that I bear a
name I think of with disgust, and hate ever to own?”</P>
<P>Camilla, thunderstruck, answered; “No, indeed! I
know nothing of all this!”</P>
<P>“Ah! guard yourself, then, well,” cried she, burst∣ing
into tears, “from a similar fate! My friends are
kind and good, but the temptation of seeing me rich
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
beguiled them. I was disinterested and contented my∣self,
but young and inexperienced; and I yielded to their
pleadings, unaware of their consequences. Alas! I
was utterly ignorant both of myself and the world! I
knew not how essential to my own peace was an ami∣able
companion; and I knew not, then,—that the
world contained one just formed to make me happy!”</P>
<P>She now hung down her head, weeping and de∣sponding.
Camilla sought to sooth her, but was so
amazed, so fearful, and so perplext, she scarce knew
what either to say or to think.</P>
<P>The fair mourner, at length, a little recovering, ad∣ded:
“Let me not agitate your gentle bosom with my
sorrows. I regard you as an angel sent to console
them; but it must be by mitigating, not partaking of
them.”</P>
<P>Camilla was sensibly touched; and though strangely
at a loss what to judge, felt her affections deeply inte∣rested</P>
<P>“I dreaded,” she continued, “to tell you my name,
for I dreaded to sink myself into your contempt, by
your knowledge of an alliance you must deem so mer∣cenary.
'Twas folly to hope you would not hear it;
yet I wished first to obtain, at least, your good will.
The dear lost name of Melmond is all I love to pro∣nounce!
That name, I believe is known to you; so
may be, also, perhaps, my brother's unhappy story?”</P>
<P>Melmond, she then said, believing Miss Lynmere
betrothed to Mr. Mandlebert, had quitted Hampshire
in misery, to finish his vacation in Wales, with their
mutual friends. There he heard that the rumour was
false; and would instantly have returned and thrown
himself at the feet of the young lady, by whose cousin,
Mr. Lionel Tyrold, he had been told she was to in∣herit
a large fortune; when this second report, also,
was contradicted, and he learnt that Miss Lynmere
had almost nothing; “My brother,” added she, “with
the true spirit of true sentiment, was but the more
urgent to pursue her; but our relations interfered—and
he, like me, is doomed to endless anguish!”</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
The accident, she said, of the preceding morning,
was owing to her being engaged in reading Rowe's
letters from the dead to the living; which had so in∣finitely
inchantrd her, that, desiring to peruse them
without interruption, yet fearing to again wander in
search of a rural retreat, she had driven to Knowle;
where, hearing the noble family was absent, she had
asked leave to view the park, and there had taken out
her delicious book, which she was enjoying in the
highest luxury of solitude and sweet air, when Lord
Newford broke in upon her.</P>
<P>Camilla enquired if she feared any bad consequences,
by telling Mr. Berlinton of his impertinence</P>
<P>“Heaven forbid,” she answered, “that I should be
condemned to speak to Mr. Berlinton of any thing that
concerns or befals me! I see him as little as I am able,
and speak to him as seldom.”</P>
<P>Camilla heard this with grief, but durst not further
press a subject so delicate. They continued together
till noon, and then reluctantly parted, upon a message
from Mrs. Arlbery that the carriages were waiting.
Mrs Berlinton declined being introduced to that lady,
which would only, she said, occasion interruptions to
their future <HI>tête-â-têtes.</HI></P>
<P>Neither the thoughtlessness of the disposition, nor
the gaiety of the imagination of Camilla, could disguise
from her understanding the glaring eccentricity of this
conduct and character: but she saw them with more of
interest than blame; the various attractions with which
they were mixed, blending in her opinion something
between pity and admiration, more captivating, though
more dangerous, to the fond fancy of youth, than the
most solid respect, and best founded esteem.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Accomplished Monkies.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Camilla descended, she found Sir Sedley
Clarendel and General Kinsale in attendance; and saw,
from the parlour window, Miss Dennel sauntering be∣fore
the house, with the newly made acquaintance of
the preceding evening.</P>
<P>The Baronet, who was to drive Mrs. Arlbery, en∣quired
if Camilla would not prefer, also, an open car∣riage.
Mrs. Arlbery, seconded the motion. Miss
Dennel, then, running to her father, exclaimed, “Pray
papa, let's take this lady I've been talking with in the
coach with us. She's the good naturedest creature I
ever knew.”</P>
<P>“Who is she? what's her name?”</P>
<P>“O, I don't know that, papa; but I'll go and ask
her.”</P>
<P>Flying then back, “Pray, ma'am,” she cried,
“what's your name? because papa want's to know.”</P>
<P>“Why, my dear, my name's Mittin. So you may
think of me when you put on your gloves.”</P>
<P>“Papa, her name's Mittin,” cried Miss Dennel,
scampering again to her father.</P>
<P>“Well, and who is she?”</P>
<P>“O, la, I'm sure I can't tell, only she's a gentle∣woman.”</P>
<P>“And how do you know that.”</P>
<P>“She told me so herself.”</P>
<P>“And where does she live?”</P>
<P>“Just by, papa, at that house you see there.”</P>
<P>“O, well, if she's a neighbour, that's enough. I've
no more to say.”</P>
<P>“O, then, I'll ask her!” cried Miss Dennel, jump∣ing,
“dear! I'm so glad! 'twould have been so dull,
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
only papa and I. I'm resolved, when I've a house of
my own, I'll never go alone any where with papa.”</P>
<P>This being muttered, the invitation was made and
accepted, and the parties set forward.</P>
<P>The ride was perfectly pleasing to Camilla, now re∣vived
and chearful; Sir Sedley was free from airs;
Mrs. Arlbery drew them into conversation with one
another, and none of them were glad when Mr. Den∣nel,
called “stop! or you'll drive too far.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who, supposing she was going, as usual, to
the Pantiles, had got into the phaeton without inquiry;
and who, finding afterwards her mistake, concluded
they were merely taking an airing, now observed she
was advancing towards a crowd, and presently perceiv∣ed
a booth, and an immense sign hung out from it, ex∣hibiting
a man monkey, or ourang outang.</P>
<P>Though excessively fluttered, she courageously, and
at once, told Mrs. Arlbery she begged to be excused
proceeding.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who had heard, at the play, the ge∣neral
objections of Mandlebert, though she had not at∣tended
to her answer, conject<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red her reason for re∣treating,
and laughed, but said she would not oppose
her.</P>
<P>Camilla then begged to wait in Mr. Dennel's carri∣age,
that she might keep no one else from the show.
Sir Sedley, saying it would be an excruciatingly vulgar
sight, proposed they should all return; but she pleaded
strongly against breaking up the party, though, while
she was handed out, to go back to the coach, the Den∣nels
and Mrs. Mittin had alighted, and it had driven
off.</P>
<P>The chagrin of Camilla was so palpable, that Mrs.
Arlbery herself agreed to resign the scheme; and Sir
Sedley, who drew up to them, said he should rejoice in
being delivered from it: but Miss Dennel, who was
waiting without the booth for her aunt, was ready to
cry at the thought of losing the sight, which Mrs. Mittin
had assured her was extremely pretty; and, after some
discussion, Camilla was reduced to beg she might do no
mischief, and consent to make one.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139"/>
A more immediate distress now occurred to her; she
heard Mr. Dennel call out to the man stationed at the
entrance of the booth, “What's to pay?” and recol∣lected
she had no money left.</P>
<P>“What your Honor pleases,” was the answer, “but
gentlefolks gives half-a-crown.”</P>
<P>“I'm sure it's well worth it,” said Mrs. Mittin,
“for it's one of the most curious things you ever saw▪
You can't give less, sir.” And she passed nimbly by,
without paying at all: but added, “I had a ticket the
first day, and now I come every day for nothing, if it
don't rain, for one only need to pay at first.”</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel and his daughter followed, and Camilla
was beginning a hesitating speech to Mrs Arlbery, as
that lady, not attending to her, said to Mr. Dennel:
“Well, frank me also; but take care what you pay;
I'm not at all sure I shall ever return it. All I save
goes to my ponies.” And, handed by the General,
she crossed the barrier; not hearing the voice of her
young friend, which was timidly beseeching her to
stop.</P>
<P>Camilla was now in extreme confusion. She put her
hand into her pocket, took it out, felt again, and again
brought forth the hand empty.</P>
<P>The Major, who was before her, and who watched
her, begged leave to settle with the booth-keeper; but
Camilla, to whom he grew daily more irksome, again
preferred a short obligation to the Baronet, and blush∣ingly
asked if he would once more be her banker?</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, by no means suspecting the necessity that
urged this condescension, was surprised and delighted,
and almost without knowing it himself, became all that
was attentive, obliging, and pleasing.</P>
<P>Before they were seated, the young Ensign, Mr. Mac∣dersey,
issuing from a group of gentlemen, addressed
himself to Camilla, though with an air that spoke him
much discomposed and out of spirits. “I hope you are
well, Miss Camilla Tyrold,” he cried; “and have
left all your family well? particularly the loveliest of
your sex, that angel of beauty, the divine Miss Lyn∣mere?”</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140"/>
“Except the company present!” said Mrs. Arlbe∣ry;
“always except the company present, when you
talk of beauty to women.”</P>
<P>“I would not except even the company absent!”
replied he, with warmth; but was interrupted from pro∣ceeding,
by what the master of the booth called his
<HI>Consort of Musics:</HI> in which not less than twenty mon∣kies
contributed their part; one dreadfully scraping a
bow across the strings of a vile kit, another beating a
drum, another with a fife, a fourth with a bagpipe, and
the sixteen remainder striking together tongs, shovels,
and pokers, by way of marrowbones and cleavers.
Every body stopt their ears, though no one could for∣bear
laughing at their various contortions, and horrible
grimaces, till the master of the booth, to keep them,
he said, in tune, dealt about such fierce blows with a
stick, that they set up a general howling, which he call∣ed
the <HI>Wocal</HI> part of his <HI>Consort,</HI> not more stunning to the
ear, than offensive to all humanity. The audience ap∣plauded
by loud shouts, but Mrs. Arlbery, disgusted,
rose to quit the booth. Camilla eagerly started up to
second the motion, but her eyes still more expediti∣ously
turned from the door, upon encountering those of
Edgar; who, having met the empty coach of Mr. Den∣nel,
had not been able to refrain from inquiring where
its company had been deposited; nor, upon hearing it
was at the <HI>accomplished Monkies,</HI> from hastening to the
spot, to satisfy himself if or not Camilla had been steady
to her declaration. But he witnessed at once the pro∣priety
of his advice, and its failure.</P>
<P>The master of the booth could not endure to see the
departure of the most brilliant part of his spectators, and
made an harangue, promising the company, at large, if
they would submit to postponing the <HI>Consort,</HI> in order
to oblige his friends the Quality, they should have it,
with the newest squalls in taste, afterwards.</P>
<P>The people laughed and clapped, and Mrs. Arlbery
sat down.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, the performers were ready for a
new exhibition. They were dressed up as soldiers,
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
who, headed by a corporal, came forward to do their
exercises.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, told the General, as he was
upon duty, he should himself take the command: the Ge∣neral,
a pleasant, yet cool and sensible man, did not laugh
less; but the Ensign, more warm tempered, and wrong
headed, seeing a feather in a monkey's cap, of the same
colour, by chance, as in his own, fired with hasty in∣dignation,
and rising, called out to the master of the
booth: “What do you mean by this, sir? do you
mean to put an affront upon our corps?”</P>
<P>The man, startled, was going must humbly to protest
his innocence of any such design; but the laugh raised
against the Ensign amongst the audience gave him more
courage, and he only simpered without speaking.</P>
<P>“What do you mean by grinning at me, sir?” said
Macdersey; “do you want me to cane you?”</P>
<P>“Cane me!” cried the man enraged, “by what
rights?”</P>
<P>Macdersey, easily put off all guard, was stepping over
the benches, with his cane uplifted, when his next
neighbour, tightly holding him, said, in a half whisper,
“If you'll take my advice, you'd a deal better provoke
him to strike the first blow.”</P>
<P>Macdersey, far more irritated by this counsel than by
the original offence, fiercely looked back, calling out
“The first blow! What do you mean by that, sir?”</P>
<P>“No offence, sir,” answered the person; who was
no other than the slow and solemn Mr. Dubster; “but
only to give you a hint for your own good; for if you
strike first, being in his own house, as one may say, he
may take the law of you.”</P>
<P>“The law!” repeated the siery Ensign; “the law
was made for poltroons: a man of honour does not
know what it means.”</P>
<P>“If you talk at that rate, sir,” said Dubster, in a
low voice, “it may bring you into trouble.”</P>
<P>“And who are you, sir, that take upon you the pre∣sumption
to give me your opinion?”</P>
<P>“Who am I, sir? I am a gentleman, if you must
needs know.”</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142"/>
“A gentleman! who made you so?”</P>
<P>“Who made me so? why leaving off business! what
would you have make me so? you may tell me if you
are any better, if you come to that.”</P>
<P>Macdersey, of an ancient and respectacle family, in∣censed
past measure, was turning back upon Mr. Dub∣ster;
when the General, taking him gently by the hand,
begged he would recollect himself.</P>
<P>“That's very true, sir, very true, General!” cried
he, profoundly bowing; “what you say is very true.
I have no right to put myself into a passion before my
superior officer, unless he puts me into it himself; in
which case 'tis his own fault. So I beg your pardon,
General, with all my heart. And I'll go out of the
booth without another half syllable. But if ever I de∣tect
any of those monkies mocking us, and wearing our
feathers, when you a'n't by, I sha'n't put up with it so
mildly. I hope you'll excuse me, General.”</P>
<P>He then bowed to him again, and begged pardon of
all the ladies; but, in quitting the booth, contemptu∣ously
said to Mr. Dubster: “As to you, you little dirty
fellow, you a'n't worth my notice.”</P>
<P>“Little dirty fellow!” repeated Mr. Dubster, when
he was gone; “How come you to think of that? why
I'm as clean as hands can make me!”</P>
<P>“Come, sir, come,” said Mrs. Mittin, reaching
over to him, and stroking his arm, “don't be angry;
these things will happen, sometimes, in public compa∣nies;
but gentlemen should be above minding them.
He meant no harm, I dare say.”</P>
<P>“O, as to that, ma'am,” answered Mr. Dubster
proudly, “I don't much care if he did or not: it's no
odds to me. Only I don't know much what right he
has to defame me. I wonder who he thinks he is that
he may break the peace for nothing. I can't say I'm
much a friend to such behaviour. Treating people with
so little ceremony.”</P>
<P>“I protest,” cried Sir Sedley to Camilla, “'tis your
favourite swain from the Northwick assembly! wafted
on some zephyr of Hope, he has pursued you to Tun∣bridge.
I flatter myself he has brought his last bran
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
new cloaths to claim your fair hand at the master of the
ceremonies' ball.”</P>
<P>“Hush! hush!” cried Camilla, in a low voice;
“he will take you literally should he hear you!”</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster, now perceiving her, bowed low from
the place where he stood, and called out, “How do
you do, ma'am? I ask pardon for not speaking to you
before; but I can't say as I see you.”</P>
<P>Camilla was forced to bow, though she made no an∣swer.
But he continued with his usual steadiness;
“Why, that was but a unked morning we was toge∣ther
so long, ma'am, in my new summer-house. We
was in fine jeopardy, that's the truth of it. Pray, how
does the young gentleman do as took away our ladder?”</P>
<P>“What a delectable acquaintance!” cried Sir Sed∣ley;
“would you have the cruelty to keep such a trea∣sure
to yourself? present me, I supplicate!”</P>
<P>“O, I know you well enough, sir,” said Mr. Dub∣ster,
who overheard him; “I see you at the hop at the
White Hart; and I believe you know me pretty well
too, sir, if I may take account by your staring. Not
that I mind it in the least.”</P>
<P>“Come, come, don't be touchy,” said Mrs. Mit∣tin;
“can't you be good-natured, and hold your
tongue? what signifies taking things amiss? It only
breeds ill words.”</P>
<P>“That's very sensibly observed upon!” said Mr.
Dennel; “I don't know when I've heard any thing
more sensibly said.”</P>
<P>“O, as to that, I don't take it amiss in the least,”
cried Mr. Dubster; “if the gentleman's a mind to
stare, let him stare. Only I should like to know what
it's for. It's no better than child's play, as one may
say, making one look foolish for nothing.”</P>
<P>The ourang outang was now announced, and Mrs.
Arlbery immediately left the booth, accompanied by
her party, and speedily followed by Edgar.</P>
<P>Neither of the carriages were in waiting, but they
would not return to the booth. Sir Sedley, to whom
standing was still rather inconvenient, begged a cast in
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
the carriage of a friend, who was accidentally passing
by.</P>
<P>Macdersey, who joined them, said he had been con∣sidering
what that fellow had proposed to him, of tak∣ing
the first blow, and found he could not put up with
it: and upon the appearance of Mr. Dubster, who in
quitting the booth was preparing, with his usual leisure∣ly
solemnity, to approach Camilla, darted forward and
seizing him by the collar, exclaimed, “Retract, sir!
Retract!”</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster stared, at first, without speech or oppo∣sition;
but being released by the Major, whom the Ge∣neral
begged to interfere, he angrily said: “Pray, sir,
what business have you to take hold of a body in such
a manner as that? It's an assault, sir, and so I can
prove. And I'm glad of it; for now I can serve you
as I did another gentleman once before, that I smarted
out of a good ten pound out of his pocket, for a knock
he gave me, for a mere nothing, just like this here pul∣ling
one by the collar, nobody knows why.”</P>
<P>The Major, endeavouring to quiet Macdersey, advised
him to despise so low a person.</P>
<P>“So I will, my dear friend,” he returned, “as
soon as ever I have given him the proper chastisement
for his ignorance. But I must do that first. You
won't take it ill, Major.”</P>
<P>“I believe,” cried Mr. Dubster, holding up both
his hands, “the like of this was never heard of!
Here's a gentleman, as he calls himself, ready to take
away my life, with his own good will, for nothing but
giving him a little bit of advice! However, it's all one
to me. The law is open to all. And if any one plays
their tricks upon me, they shall pay for their fun. I'm
none of your tame ones to put up with such a thing for
nothing. I'm above that, I promise you.”</P>
<P>“Don't talk, sir, don't talk!” cried Macdersey;
“it's a thing I can't bear from a mean person, to be
talked to. I had a hundred thousand times rather stand
to be shot at.”</P>
<P>“Not talk, sir? I should be glad to know what
right you has to hinder me, provided I say nothing
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
against the law? And as to being a mean person, it's
more than you can prove, for I'm sure you don't know
who I am, nor nothing about me. I may be a lord,
for any thing you know, though I don't pretend to say I
am. But as to what people take me for, that behave so
out of character, it's what I sha'n't trouble my head
about. They may take me for a chimney-sweeper, or
they may take me for a duke; which they like. I
sha'n't tell them whether I'm one or t'other, or whether
I'm neither. And as to not talking, I shall hold my
tongue when I think proper.”</P>
<P>“Ask my pardon this instant, fellow!” cried the
Ensign, whom the Major, at the motion of the Gene∣ral,
now caught by the arm, and hurried from the spot:
Mrs. Mittin, at the same moment pulling away Mr.
Dubster, and notably expounding to him the advantages
of patience and good humour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, wearied both of this squabble and of
waiting, took the arm of the General, and said she
would walk home; Miss Dennel lovingly held by Mrs.
Mittin, with whom her father also assorted, and by
whom Mr. Dubster was drawn on.</P>
<P>Camilla alone had no immediate companion, as the
Major was occupied by the Ensign. Edgar saw her
disengaged. He trembled, he wavered; he wished the
Major back; he wished him still more at a distance too
remote ever to return; he thought he would instantly
mount his horse, and gallop towards Beech Park; but
the horse was not ready, and Camilla was in sight;—
and, in less than a minute, he found himself, scarce
knowing how, at her side.</P>
<P>Camilla felt a pleasure that bounded to her heart,
though the late assertions of Mrs. Arlbery prepared her
to expect him. He knew not, however, what to say;
he felt mortified and disappointed, and when he had
uttered something scarce intelligible about the weather,
he walked on in silence.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose present train of thoughts had no dis∣cordant
tendency, broke through this strangeness her∣self,
and said: “How frivolous I must appear to you!
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
but indeed I was at the very door of the booth, before
I knew whither the party was going.'</P>
<P>“You did not, I hope, at least,” he cried, “when
you had entered it, deem me too rigid, too austere,
that I thought the species, both of company and of en∣tertainment,
ill calculated for a young lady?”</P>
<P>“Rigid! austere!” repeated she; “I never thought
you either! never—and if once again—” she stopt;
embarrassed, ashamed.</P>
<P>“If once again what?” cried he in a tremulous
voice; “what would Miss Camilla say?—would she
again—Is there yet—What would Miss Camilla say?”</P>
<P>Camilla felt confounded, both with ideas of what
he meant to allude to, and what construction he had
put upon her half finished sentence. Impatient, howe∣ver,
to clear that, “If once more,” she cried, “you
could prevail with yourself—now and then—from time
to time—to give me an hint, an idea—of what you
think right—I will promise, if not a constant observ∣ance,
at least a never-failing sense of your kindness.”</P>
<P>The revulsion in the heart, in the whole frame of
Edgar, was almost too powerful for restraint: he pant∣ed
for an immediate explanation of every past and every
present difficulty, and a final avowal that she was either
self-destined to the Major, or that he had no rival to
fear: But before he could make any answer, a sudden
and violent shower broke up the conference, and group∣ed
the whole party under a large tree.</P>
<P>This interruption, however, had no power upon their
thoughts; neither of them heard a word that was say∣ing;
each ruminated intently, though confusedly, upon
what already was passed. Yet where the wind preci∣pitated
the rain, Edgar stationed himself, and held his
hat to intercept its passage to Camillia; and as her eye
involuntarily was caught by the shower that pattered
upon his head and shoulders, she insensibly pressed near∣er
to the trunk of the tree, to afford more shelter to him
from its branches.</P>
<P>The rest of the party partook not of this tacitur∣nity:
Mr. Dubster, staring Mrs. Mittin full in the face,
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
exclaimed: “I think I ought to know you, ma'am,
asking your pardon?”</P>
<P>“No matter for that!” cried she, turning with
quickness to Camilla; “Lord, miss—I don't know
your name,—how your poor hat is all I don't know
how! as limp, and as flimzy, as if it had been in a
wash-tub!”</P>
<P>“I've just bethought me▪” continued he, “where it
was we used to see one another, and all the whole man∣ner
of it. I've got it as clear in my head as if it was
but yesterday. Don't you remember—”</P>
<P>“Can't you stand a little out there?” interrupted
she; “what signifies a man's old coat? don't you see
how you let all the rain come upon this young lady?
you should never think of yourself, but only of what
you can do to be obliging.”</P>
<P>“A very good rule, that! a very good one indeed!”
said Mr Dennel; “I wish every body would mind it.”</P>
<P>“I'm as willing to mind it, I believe said Mr. Dub∣ster,
“as my neighbours; but as to being wet through,
for m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re complaisance, I don't think it fair to expect
such a thing of nobody. Besides, this is not such
an old coat as you may think for. If you was to see
what I wear at home, I promise you would not think
so bad of it. I don't say it's my best; who'd be fool
then, to wear it every day? However, I believe it's
pretty nigh as good as that I had on that night I saw
you at Mrs. Purdle's, when, you know, one of your
pattens—”</P>
<P>“Come, come, what's the man talking about? one
person should not take all the conversation up so. Dear
miss—do tell me your name?—I am so sorry for your
hat, I can't but think of it; it looks as dingy!—”</P>
<P>“Why, now, you won't make me believe,” said
Mr. Dubster, “you've forgot how your patten broke;
and how I squeezed my finger under the iron? And
how I'd like to have lost the use of it? There would
have been a fine job! And how Mrs. Purdle—”</P>
<P>“I'm sure the shower's over,” cried Mrs. Mittin,
“and if we stay here, we shall have all the droppings
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
of the leaves upon us. Poor miss thing-o-me's hat is
spoilt already. There's no need to make it worse.”</P>
<P>“And how Mrs. Purdle,” he continued, was oblig∣ed
to lend you a pair of shoes and stockings, because
you was wet through your feet? And how they would
not fit you, and kept tumbling off? And how, when
somebody come to fetch you in their own coach, you
made us say you was taken ill because you was so
daubed with mud and mire, you was ashamed to shew
yourself? And how—”</P>
<P>“I can't think what you are talking of” said Mrs.
Mittin; “but come, let's you and I go a little way on,
to see if the rain's over.” She then went some paces
from the tree, and said: “What signifies running on
so, Mr Dubster, about things nobody knows any thing
of? It's tiring all the company to death. You should
never talk about your own singers, and hap-hazards,
to genteel people. You should only talk about agree∣able
subjects as I do. See how they all like me! That
gentleman brought me to the monkies in his own
coach.”</P>
<P>“As to that,” answered he, gravely, “I did not
mean▪ in the least, to say any thing disagreeable; only
I thought it odd you should not seem to know me again,
considering Mrs. Purdle used—”</P>
<P>“Why you've no nous, Mr. Dubster; Mrs. Purdle's
a very good sort of woman and the best friend I have
in the world▪ perhaps, at the bottom; but she i'n't a
sort of person to talk of before gentlefolks. You
should talk to great people about their own affairs,
and what you can do to please them, and find out how
you can serve them, if you'd be treated genteelly by
them, as I am. Why, I go every where, and see every
thing and it costs me nothing A friend, a lady of
great fashion, took me one day to the monkies, and
paid for me; and I've gone since, whenever I will for
nothing.”</P>
<P>“Nobody treats me to nothing,” answered he, in a
melancholy voice, “whatever's the reason: except:
when I make friends with somebody that can let me
in free, sometimes. And I get a peep, now and then,
at what goes forward, that way.”</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149"/>
“But you are rich enough to pay for yourself now,
Mr. Dubster; good lack! if I had such a fortune as
yours, I'd go all the the world over, and thanks to no∣body.”</P>
<P>“And how long would you be rich then, Mrs.
Mittin? Who'd give you your money again when you'd
spent it? I got mine hard enough. I sha'n't fool it
away in a hurry, I promise you!”</P>
<P>“I can't say I see that, Mr. Dubster, when two of
your wives died so soon, and left you so handsome.”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, I don't say to the contrary of that;
but then, think of the time before, when I was 'pren∣tice!—”</P>
<P>The shower was now over, and the party proceeded
as before.</P>
<P>Edgar, uncertain, irresolute, walked on in silence:
yet attentive, assiduous, even tenderly watchful to guide,
guard, and assist his fair companion in her way. The
name of the Major trembled perpetually upon his lips;
but fear what might be the result of his inquiries stopt
his speech till they approached the house; when he
commanded voice to say: “You permit then the re∣newal
of my old privilege?”</P>
<P>“Permit! I wish for it!'</P>
<P>They were now at the door. Edgar, not daring to
speak again to Camilla, and not able to address any one
else, took his leave; enchanted that he was authoriz∣ed,
once more, to inform himself with openness of
the state of her affairs, and of her conduct. And
Camilla, dwelling with delight upon the discernment
of Mrs. Arlbery, blest the happy penetration that had
endowed her with courage to speak again to Edgar
in terms of friendship and confidence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, declaring she could not eat till she had
seen what could be done for the hat of Miss Tyrold,
accompanied her up stairs, took it off herself, wiped
it, smoothed, and tried to new arrange it; and, at
last, failing to succeed, insisted upon taking it home,
to put it in order, and promised to return it in the
morning time enough for the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiles. Camilla was
much ashamed; but she had no means to buy another,
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
and she had now lost her indifference to going abroad.
She thought, therefore, this new acquaintance at least
as useful as she was officious, and accepted her civility
with thanks.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rooms.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening, as usual, was destined to the Rooms.
The first object Camilla perceived upon her entrance was
Edgar, and the smile with which she met his eye
brought him instantly to her side. That smile was not
less radiant for his nearer approach; nor was the plea∣fure
in it less animated for observing that Major Cer∣wood
was not of her party, nor as yet in the room.
The opportunity seemed inviting to engage her himself,
to suggest and to find it irresistible was the same thing,
and he inquired if her whole evening were arranged, or
she would go down two dances with an old friend.</P>
<P>The softness of her assent was even exquisite delight
to him; and, as they all walked up and down the
apartment, though he addressed her but little, and
though she spoke but in answer, every word he uttered
she received as couching some gentle meaning, and eve∣ry
syllable she replied, he thought conveyed something
of flattering interest: and although all was upon open
and unavoidable subjects, he had no eyes but for her,
she had no attention but for him.</P>
<P>This quiet, yet heart-felt intercourse, was soon a
little interrupted by the appearance of a large and strik∣ing
party, led on by Lady Alithea Selmore; for which
every body made way, to which every body turned,
and which, passing by all the company without se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
conscious there was any to pass, formed a mass at the
upper end of the room, with an air and manner of such
exclusive attention to their chief, or to one another,
that common observation would have concluded some
film before their eyes obstructed their discerning that
they were not the sole engrossers of the apartment.</P>
<P>But such was not the judgment formed of them by
Mrs. Arlbery, who, forced by the stream to give them
passage, paid herself for the condescension by a com∣mentary
upon the passengers. “Those good people,”
said she, “strive to make us believe we are nothing to
them. They strive even to believe it themselves. But
this is the mere semblance worn by pride and affectation,
to veil internal fatigue. They come hither to recruit
their exhausted powers, not, indeed, by joining in our
society, but by a view of new objects for their senses,
and the flattering idea, for their minds, of the envy or
admiration they excite. They are all people of some
consequence, and many of them are people of title:
but these are far the most supportable of the group;
their privileged superiority over the rest is so marked
and indisputable, that they are saved the trouble either
of claiming or ascertaining it: but those who approach
their rank without reaching it, live in a constant strug∣gle
to make known their importance. Indeed, I have
often seen that people of title are less gratified with the
sound of their own honours, than people of no title in
pronouncing them.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley Clarendel was of this set. Like the rest
he passed Mrs. Arlbery without seeming to notice her,
and was passing Camilla in the same manner; but not
aware this was only to be sine, like the party to
which he belonged, she very innocently spoke to him
herself, to hope he got safe to his lodgings, without
feeling any further ill effect from his accident.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though internally much gratified by this
interest in his safety, which in Camilla was the result
of having herself endangered it looked as if be scarce
recollected her, and making hastily a kind of half bow,
walked on with his company.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152"/>
Camilla, who had no view, nor one serious thought
concerning him, was rather amused than displeased by
his caprices; and was preparing to relate the history
of his lameness to Edgar, who seemed surprised and
even hurt by her addressing him, and by his so slightly
passing her, when the entrance of another splendid party
interrupted all discourse.</P>
<P>And here, to her utter amaze▪ she beheld as chief
of the group, her romantic new friend; not leading,
indeed, like Lady Alithca Selmore, a train, but sur∣rounded
by admirers, who, seeking no eye but hers,
seemed dim and humble planets, moving round a ra∣diant
sun.</P>
<P>Camilla, now forgetting Sir Sedley, would have
taken this moment to narrate her adventure with Mrs.
Berlinton, had not her design been defeated by the
approach of the Major. He belonged to this last group,
but was the only one that separated from it. He spoke
to Camilla with his usual air of devotion, told her he
had dined with Mrs, Berlinton, to whose husband,
whom he had taken for her grandfather, he had been
just introduced; and begged to know of Mrs. Arl∣bery
if he might have the pleasure of bringing them
all acquainted; an offer which Camilla, unauthorised
by Mrs. Berlinton, had not ventured to make. Mrs.
Arlbery declined the proposal; not anxious to mix
where she had small chance of presiding.</P>
<P>The party▪ after traversing the room, took full and
exclusive possession of a considerable spot just below that
occupied by Lady Alithea.</P>
<P>These two companies completely engrossed all atten∣tion,
amply supplying the rest of the assembly with to∣pics
for discourse. The set with Lady Alithea Sel∣more,
was, in general, haughty, supercilious, and
taciturn; looking around with eyes determined to see
neither any person nor any thing before them, and
rarely speaking▪ except to applaud what fell from her
ladyship; who far less proud, because a lover of popu∣larity,
deigned herself, from time to time, a slight
glance at the company, to see if she was observed, and
to enjoy its reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153"/>
The party to which Mrs. Berlinton was the load∣stone,
was far more artractive to the disciples of na∣ture,
though less sedulously sought by those whom the
manners and maxims of the common world had sophis∣ticated.
They were gay, elegant, desirous to please,
because pleased themselves; and though some of them
harboured designs deeper and more dangerous than any
formed by the votaries of rank, they appeared to have
nothing more in view than to decorate with flowers the
present moment. The magnetic influence of beauty
was, however, more powerful than that of the <HI>ton;</HI>
for though Mrs. Berlinton, from time to time, allured
a beau from Lady Alithea Selmore, her ladyship, dur∣ing
the whole season, had not one retaliation to boast.
But, on the other hand, the females, in general, strove
to cluster about Lady Alithea; Mrs. Berlinton leav∣ing
them no greater chance of rivalship in conversation
than in charms.</P>
<P>Edgar had made way upon the approach of the
Major, who wore an air of superior claim extremely
unpleasant to him; but, since already engaged to Ca∣milla,
he meant to return to her when the dancing
began.</P>
<P>She concluded he left her but to speak to some ac∣quaintance,
and was, herself, amply occupied in observ∣ing
her new friend. The light in which she now beheld
her, admired, pursued, and adulated, elegantly adorn∣ed
in her person, and evidently with but one rival for
fame and fashion in Tunbridge, filled her with asto∣nishment.
Nothing could less assort with her passion
for solitude, her fondness for literary and sentimental
discussions, and her enthusiasm in friendship. But her
surprise was mixed with praise and admiration, when
she reflected upon the soft humility and caressing sweet∣ness
of her manners, yet found her, by general consent,
holding this elevated rank in society.</P>
<P>The Major earnestly pressed to conduct Camilla to
this coterie, assuring her Mrs. Berlinton would not
have passed, had she seen her, for, during dinner, and
at coffee, she had talked of nobody else. Camilla
heard this with pleasure, but shrunk from all advances,
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
and strove rather to hide than shew herself, that Mrs.
Berlinton might have full liberty either to seek or
avoid her. She wished to consult Edgar upon this ac∣quaintance;
though the present splendour of her ap∣pearance▪
and the number of her followers, made her
fear she could never induce him to do justice to the
sweetness and endearment of her social powers.</P>
<P>When the Major found he pleaded in vain, he said
he would at least let Mrs. Berlinton know where to look
for her; and went himself to that lady.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had felt sensibly mortified to observe,
when he retreated, that the eyes and attention of Ca∣milla
had been wholly bestowed upon what he consider∣ed
merely as a new scene, was now coming forward;
when he saw Mrs. Berlinton hastily rise, suddenly
break from all her adulators, and, with quick steps and
animated gestures, traverse the apartment, to address
Camilla, whom taking by both her hands, which she
pressed to her heart, she conjured, in the most flattering
terms, to accompany her back.</P>
<P>Camilla was much gratified; yet, from delicacy to
Mrs. Arlbery, stimulated by the fear of missing her ex∣pected
partner in the country dances, declined the invi∣tation:
Mrs. Berlinton looked disappointed; but
said she would not be importunate, and returned
alone.</P>
<P>Camilla, a little disturbed, besought the Major to
follow, with an offer of spending with her, if she pleas∣ed,
the whole of the ensuing day.</P>
<P>“Charming!” cried the Major, “for I am engaged
to her myself already.”</P>
<P>To Camilla this hearing was distressing; to Edgar
it was scarcely endurable. But she could not retract,
and Edgar was stopt in the inquiries he meant to make
concerning this striking new acquaintance, by an abrupt
declaration from Mrs. Arlbery, that the Rooms were
insufferable, and she would immediately go home. She
then gave her hand to the General, and Miss Dennel
took the arm of Camilla, murmuring, that she would
never leave the Rooms at such an early hour again,
when once she was married.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155"/>
To quit Edgar thus, at the very moment of renewed
intercourse and amity, seemed too cruel; and Camilla,
though with blushes, and stammering, whispered Mrs.
Arlbery, “What can I do, ma'am? most unfortunate∣ly
I have engaged myself to dance.?”</P>
<P>“With whom?”</P>
<P>“With—Mr.—Mandlebert.”</P>
<P>“O, vastly well! Stay, then by all means: but, as
he has not engaged me too, allow me I beseech you
to escape Mrs Berlinton will, I am sure, be happy
to take care of you.”</P>
<P>This scheme was, to Camilla, the most pleasant that
could be proposed; and, at the same instant, the Ma∣jor
returned to her, with these words written with a
pencil upon the back of a letter.</P>
<P>“To-morrow, and next day, and next day, come to
me, my lovely friend; every thing, and every body fa∣tigues
me but yourself.”</P>
<P>Camilla, obliged again to have recourse to the Ma∣jor,
wrote, upon the same paper, “Can you have the
goodness to convey me to Mount Pleasant to-night,” if I
stay? and begged him to bring her an answer. She en∣treated,
also, Mrs. Arlbery to stop, till it arrived, which
was almost in the same minute; for the eye of Mrs. Ber∣linton
had but glanced upon the words, ere her soft
and lovely form was again with their fair writer, with
whom, smiling and delighted, she walked back, arm in
arm, to her place.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery and the General, and Mr. and Miss
Dennel, now lest the room.</P>
<P>Edgar viewed all this with amazement. He found
that the young lady she joined was sister-in-law to a peer,
and as fashionable as she was beautiful; but could not
fathom how so great an intimacy had so suddenly been
formed.</P>
<P>Camilla, thus distinguished, became now herself an
object of peculiar notice; her own personal claim to par∣ticular
attention her dejection had forfeited, for it had
robbed her eyes of their animation, and her countenance
of its play; but no contagion spreads with greater cer∣tainty
nor greater speed than that of fashion; slander it∣self
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
is not more sure of promulgation. She was now
looked at by all present as if seen for the first time;
every one discovered in her some charm, some grace,
some excellence; those who, the minute before, had
passed her with perfect indifference, said it was impos∣sible
to see and not be struck with her; and all agreed
the could appear upon no spot under the sun, and not
instinctively be singled out, as formed to shine in the
highest sphere.</P>
<P>But he by whom this transaction was observed with
most pleasure, was Sir Sedley Clarendel. The extra∣ordinary
service he had performed for Camilla, and the
grateful interest she had shewn him in return, had led
him to consider her with an attention so favourable,
that, without half her merit, or half her beauty, she
could not have failed rising in his estimation, and ex∣citing
his regard: and she had now a superior charm
that distanced every other; she had been asked to dance,
yet refused it, by a man of celebrity in the <HI>ton;</HI> and she
was publicly sought and caressed by the only rival at
Tunbridge, in that species of renoun, to Lady Alithea
Selmore.</P>
<P>He felt an increased desire to be presented to Mrs.
Berlinton himself; and, gliding from his own circle as
quietly as he could contrive, not to offend Lady Alithea,
who, though she laughed at <HI>the little Welsh rustic,</HI> was
watchful of her votaries, and jealous of her rising power,
came gently behind Lord O'Lerney and whispered his
request.</P>
<P>He was received by the young beauty with that grace,
and that sweetness which rendered her so generally be∣witching,
yet with an air that proved her already accus∣tomed
to admiration, and untouched by its intoxicating
qualities▪ All that was voluntary of her attention was
bestowed exclusively upon Camilla, though, when ad∣dressed
and called upon by others, she answered without
impatience, and looked without displeasure.</P>
<P>This conduct, at the same time that it shewed her in
a point of view the most amiable, raised Camilla higher
and higher in the eyes of the bye-standers: and, in a
few minutes more, the general cry throughout the as∣sembly
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
was to inquire who was the young lady thus
brought forward by Mrs Berlinton.</P>
<P>Edgar heard this with increased anxiety. Has she
discretion, has she fortitude, thought he, to withstand
public distinction? Will it not spoil her for private life;
estrange her from family concerns? render tasteless and
insipid the conjugal and maternal characters, meant by
Nature to form not only the most sacred of duties, but
the most delicious of enjoyments?</P>
<P>Very soon after, this anxiety was tinctured with a
a feeling more severe; he saw her spoken to negligently
by Sir Sedley; he required, after what he had already
himself deemed impertinence from the Baronet, that
she should have assumed to him a distant dignity; but he
perceived, on the contrary, that she answered him with
pleasant alacrity, and, when not engaged by Mrs.
Berlinton, attended to him, even with distinction.</P>
<P>Alas! thought he the degradation from the true fe∣male
character is already begun! already the lure of fa∣shion
draws her from what she owes to delicacy and
propriety, to give a willing reception to insolence and
foppery!</P>
<P>Camilla, mean while, unsuspicious of his remarks, and
persuaded every civility in her power was due to Sir
Sedley, was gay, pleased, and pleasing; happy to consi∣der
herself under the guidance, and restored to the amity
of Edgar, and determined to acquaint him with all her
affairs, and consult him upon all her proceedings</P>
<P>The dancing, for which mutually they languished, as
the mutual means of re-union▪ seemed not to be the hu∣mour
of the evening, and those who were ready for it,
were not of sufficient consequence to bring it forward.
But when Mrs. Berlinton mentioned, that she had
been taking some lessons in a co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illon, a universal cry
was raised by all her party, to try one immediately. She
pleaded in vain her inexperience in such dances; they
insisted there was nobody present that could criticise,
that her form alone would compensate for every mistake
of rule, and that the best lesson was easy practice.</P>
<P>She was soon gained, for she was not addicted to de∣nials;
but the application which ensued to Camilla was
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
acceded to less promptly. As there were but two other
ladies in the circle of Mrs. Berlinton, her assistance was
declared to be indespensable. She pleaded inability of
every sort, though to dance without Edgar was her only
real objection; for she had no false shame in being ig∣norant
of what she never had learnt. But Mrs. Ber∣linton
protested she would not rise if she were the only
novice to be exhibited; and the Major then prepared to
prostrate himself at the feet of Camilla; who, hastily,
and ashamed, stood up, to prevent an action that Edgar
might misinterpret.</P>
<P>Hoping, however, now, to at least draw him into
their set, she ventured to acknowledge to Mrs. Berlin∣ton,
that she was already engaged, in case she danced.</P>
<P>The Major, who heard her, and who knew it was
not to himself, strenuously declared this could only be
for country dances, and therefore would not interfere
with a cotillon.</P>
<P>“Will country dances, then,” said she, blushing,
“follow?”</P>
<P>“Certainly, if any one has spirit to begin them.”</P>
<P>The cotillon was now played, and the preceding bow
from the opposite Major forced her courtsie in return.</P>
<P>The little skill in this dance of one of the performers,
and the total want of it in another, made it a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re plea∣santry
to all, though the youth and beauty of the two
who did the worst, rendered them objects of admiration,
that left nearly unnoticed those who did best</P>
<P>To Camilla what belonged to pleasantry in this busi∣ness
was of short duration. When the cotillon was
over▪ she saw nothing of Edgar. She looked around,
mortified, disappointed. No one called for a country
dance; and the few who had wished for it, concluding
all chance over when a cotillon was begun, had now re∣tired,
or given it up.</P>
<P>What was this disappointment, compared with the
sufferings of Edgar? Something of a contest, and of en∣treaties
had reached his ears, while he had hovered
near the party, or strolled up and down the room. He
had gathered the subject was dancing, and he saw the
Major most earnest with Camilla. He was sure it was
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
for her hand, and concluded it was for a country dance;
but could she forfeit her engagement? were matters so
far advanced, as to make her so openly shew him all
prevailing, all powerful, not only over all rivals, but, ac∣cording
to the world's established customs upon these oc∣casions,
over all decorum?</P>
<P>Presently, he saw the Major half kneel; he saw her
rise to prevent the prostration; and he heard the dance
called.</P>
<P>He could bear no more; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain intolerable seized, dis∣tracted
him, and he abruptly quitted the ball-room, lest
the Major should approach him with some happy apo∣logy,
which he was unfitted to receive.</P>
<P>He could only settle his ideas by supposing she really
loved Major Cerwood, and had suffered her character
to be infected by the indelicacy that made a part of his
own. Yet why had she so strove to deny all regard, all
connection? what an unaccountable want of frankness!
what a miserable dereliction of truth!</P>
<P>His first impulse was to set off instantly from Tun∣bridge;
but his second thoughts represented the confes∣sion
this would make. He was too proud to leave the
Major, whom he despised, such a triumph, and too much
hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to permit Camilla herself to know him so poig∣nantly
wounded. She could not, indeed, but be struck
by his retreat; he resolved, however, to try to meet with
her the next day, and to speak to her with the amity
they had so lately arranged, yet in a way that should
manifest him wholly free from all other interest or view.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ways to the Heart.</HEAD>
<P>ALL pleasure to Camilla was completely over from
the moment that Edgar disappeared</P>
<P>When she returned to Mount Pleasant, Mrs. Arlbery,
whom she found alone, said, “Did I not understand
that you were going to dance with Mr. Mandlebert?
How chanced he to leave you? We were kept ages
waiting for the coach; and I saw him pass by, and walk
off.”</P>
<P>Camilla, colouring, related the history of the cotil∣lon;
and said, she feared, not knowing how she had been
circumstanced, he was displeased.</P>
<P>“Displeased'” cried Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; “and
do you, at seventeen, suffer a man to be displeased?
How can you do worse when you are fifty? Know your
own power more truly, and use it better. Men, my
dear, are all spoilt by humility, and all conquered by
gaiety. Amuse and defy them!—attend to that maxim,
and you will have the world at your feet.”</P>
<P>“I have no such ambition:—but I should be sensibly
hurt to make an old friend think ill of me.”</P>
<P>“When an old friend,” said Mrs. Arlbery, archly,
“happens to be a young man, you must conduct your∣self
with him a little like what you are; that is, a young
woman. And a young woman is never in her proper
place, if such sort of old friends are not caught to know
their own. From the instant you permit them to think
of being offended, they become your masters; and you
will find it vastly more convenient to make them your
slaves.”</P>
<P>Camilla pretended to understand this in a mere gene∣ral
sense, and wished her good night.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161"/>
The next morning at an early hour, her chamber door
was opened with great suddenness, and no preparation,
and Mrs. Mittin tript nimbly into the room, with a hat
in her hand.</P>
<P>“Look here! my dear Miss Tyrold,” cried she, “for
now that other young lady has told me your name, and
I writ it down upon paper, that I might not forget it
again: look at your hat now! Did you ever see any
thing so much improved for the better? I declare no∣body
would know it! Miss Dennel says it's as pretty
again as it was at first. I ll go and shew it to the other
lady.”</P>
<P>Away she went, triumphant, with the trophy of her
notability; but presently returned, saying, “Do, pray,
Miss Tyrold, write me down that other lady's name upon
a scrap of paper. It always goes out of my head. And
one looks as if one knew nobody, when one forgets
people's names.”</P>
<P>Camilla complied, and expressed her shame to have
caused her so much trouble.</P>
<P>“O, my dear, it's none at all. I got all the things at
Mrs. Tillden's”</P>
<P>“Who is Mrs. Tillden?” cried Camilla, staring.</P>
<P>“Why the milliner.” Don't you know that?</P>
<P>“What things?” asked Camilla, alarmed.</P>
<P>“Why these, my dear; don't you see? Why it's all
new, except just the hat itself, and the feathers.”</P>
<P>Camilla was now in extreme embarrassment. She had
concluded Mrs. Mittin had only newly arranged the or∣naments,
and had not the smallest idea of incurring a
debt which she had no means to discharge.</P>
<P>“It all comes to quite a trifle,” continued Mrs. Mit∣tin,
“for all it's so pretty. Mrs. Tillden's things are
all monstrous cheap. I get things for next to nothing
from her, sometimes, when they are a little past the
mode. But then I recommend her a heap of cus∣tomers.
I get all my friends, by hook or by crook, to
go to her shop.”</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162"/>
“And what.” stammered out Camilla, “besides my
thanks, do I owe you?”</P>
<P>“Oh, nothing. She would not be paid; she said,
as you was her customer, and had all your things of
her at first, she'd put it down in your bill for the sea∣son.”</P>
<P>This was, at least, some respite; though Camilla felt
the disagreeable necessity of increasing her intended de∣mand
upon Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel came with a summons from that lady to
the Pantiles, whither, as the day was fine, she proposed
they should walk.</P>
<P>“O,” cried Mrs. Mittin, “if you are going upon
the Pantiles, you must go to that shop where there's
the curious ear-rings that are to be raffled for. You'll
put in to be sure.”</P>
<P>Camilla said no, with a sigh attributed to the ear∣rings,
but due to a tender recollection of the raffle in
which Edgar had procured her the trinket she most va∣lued.
Mrs. Mittin proposed accompanying them, and
asked Camilla to introduce her to Mrs. Arlbery. This
was very disagreeable; but she knew not how, after the
civility she owed her, to refuse.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery received her with much surprize, but
perfect unconcern; conscious of her own importance,
she feared no disgrace from being seen with one in a
lower station; and she conceived it no honour to ap∣pear
with one in a higher</P>
<P>When they came to the Pantiles, Mrs. Mittin beg∣ged
to introduce them to a view of the ear-rings, which
belonged, she said, to one of her particular friends;
and as Mrs. Arlbery caught the eye of Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel
in passing the window, she entered the shop.</P>
<P>“Well,” cried Mrs. Mittin, to its master, “don't
say I bring you no company. I am sure you ought to
let me throw for nothing, if it's only for good luck; for
I am sure these ladies will all put in. Come▪ Miss
Dennel, do lead the way. 'Tis but half a guinea, and
only look what a prize.”</P>
<P>“Ask papa to pay for me!” cried Miss Dennel.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163"/>
“Come, good sir, come, put down the half guinea
for the young lady. I'm sure you can't refuse her,
Lord! what a half a guinea?”</P>
<P>“That's a very bad way of reasoning,” answered Mr.
Dennel; “and what I did not expect from a woman
of your sense.”</P>
<P>“Why you don't think, sir, I meant that half a
guinea's a trifle? No indeed▪ I know what money is
better than that. I only mean half a guinea is nothing
in comparison to ten guineas, which is the price of the
ear-rings; and so that makes me think it's pity the
young lady should lose an opportunity of getting them
so cheap. I'm sure if they were dear, I should be the
last to recommend them, for I think extravagance the
greatest sin under the sun”</P>
<P>“Well, now you speak like the sensible woman I took
you for.”</P>
<P>A very little more eloquence of this sort was necessa∣ry,
before Mr Dennel put down half a guinea.</P>
<P>“Well,” I declare, cried Mrs. Mittin, “there's only
three more names wanted; and when these two ladies
have put in, there will be only one! I'm sure if I was
rich enough, that one would not be far off. But come,
ma'am, where's your half guinea? Come, Miss
Tyrold, don't hold back; who knows but you may
win? there's only nineteen against you. Lord what's
that?”</P>
<P>Camilla turned away, and Mrs. Arlbery did not
listen to a word; but when Sir Sedley said, “They are
really very pretty; won't you throw?” she answered,
“I must rather make a raffle with my own trinkets,
than raffle for other people's. Think of my ponies!
However, I'll put in, if Mr. Dennel will be my pay∣master.”</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel, turning short off, walked out of the
shop.</P>
<P>“This is a bad omen!” cried she, laughing; and
then desired to look at the list of rafflers; when seeing
amongst the names those of Lady Alithea Selmore and
the Hon. Mrs. Berlinton, she exclaimed: “'Tis a
coalition of all fashion and reputation! We shall be ab∣solutely
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
scouted, my dear Miss Tyrold, if we shrink.
My poor ponies must wait half a guinea longer! Let
us put in together.”</P>
<P>Camilla answered, she had no intention to try for
them.</P>
<P>“Well, then, lend me half a guinea; for I never
trust myself, now, with my purse.”</P>
<P>“I have not a half guinea—I have—I have no—gold
—in my purse,” answered Camilla, with a face deeply
tinged with red.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood, who joined the party during this
discussion, intreated to be banke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for both the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sics.
Camilla positively refused any share; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. Mittin
said it would be a shame for such a young lady to go
without her chance, and wrote do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her name next
to that of Mrs. Arlbery; while the Major, without
further question, put down a guinea upon the coun∣ter.</P>
<P>Camilla could not endure this; yet from a youthful
shame of confessing poverty, forced herself to the ear of
Mrs. Arlbery, and whispered an intreaty that she would
pay the guinea herself</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, surprized, answered she had really
come out without her purse; but seeing her seriously
vexed, added, “If you do not approve of the Major
for a banker till we go home, what say you to Sir
Sedley?”</P>
<P>“I shall prefer him a thousand times!”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice, repeated this to the
young Baronet, and receiving his guinea, threw it
down, making the Major, without the smallest excuse
or ceremony, take back his own.</P>
<P>This was by no means lost upon Sir Sedley; he
felt flattered—he felt softened; he thought Camilla
looked unusually lovely; he began to wonder at the
coldness of Mandlebert, and to lament that the first
affections of so fair a creature should be cast away.</P>
<P>Mandlebert himself was an object of nothing less
than envy. He had entered the shop during the con∣test
about the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>affle, and seen Major Cerwood pay for
Camilla as well as for Mrs. Arlbery. Confirmed in
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
his notions of her positive engagement, and sick at
heart from the confirmation, he walked further into the
shop, upon pretence of looking at some other articles,
before he could assume sufficient composure to speak to
her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin now began woefully to repine that she
could not take the last share for the ear-rings; and ad∣dressing
herself to Mr. Dennel, who re-entered as soon
as he saw the money was paid for Mrs. Arlbery, she
said, “You see, sir, if there was somebody ready to
take the last chance at once, this gentleman might
fix a day for the throwing immediately; but else, it may
be dawdled on, nobody knows how long; for one will
be gone, and t'other will be gone, and there'll be no
getting the people together; and all the pleasure of the
thing is being here to throw for one's self: for I don't
much like trusting money matters out of sight.”</P>
<P>“If I'd thought of all that,” said Mr. Dennel, “I
should not have put in.”</P>
<P>“True, sir▪ But here, if it was not that I don't
happen to have half a guinea to spare just now, how
nicely it might all be finished in a trice! For, as I
have been saying to Miss Dennel, this may turn out
a real bargain; for they'll fetch their full value at any
time. And I tell Miss Dennel that's the only way to
lay out money, upon things that will bring it back again
if it's wanted; not upon frippery froppery, that's spoilt
in a minute, and then i'n't worth a farthing.”</P>
<P>“Very sensibly said,” cried Mr Dennel; “I'm
sure she can't hear better advice; I'm much obliged to
you for putting such sensible thoughts into her head.”
And then, hoping she would continue her good lessons
to his daughter, he drew out his purse, and begged her
to accept a chance from it for the prize.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin was in raptures; and the following week
was settled for the raffle.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who had attended to this scene with
much amusement, now said to General Kinsale, who
had taken a seat by her: “Did I not tell you well,
General, that all men are at the disposition of women?
If even the shrewd monied man cannot resist, what
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
heart shall we find impenetrable? The connoisseur in
human characters knows, that the pursuit of wealth is
the petrifaction of tenderness: yet yonder is my good
brother-in-law, who thinks cash and existence one,
allured even to squander money, merely by the address
of that woman, in allowing that money should be the
first study of life! Let even Clarendel have a care of
himself, or, when least he suspects any danger, some
fair dairy-maid will praise his horsemanship, or take a
fancy to his favourite spaniel, or any other favourite that
happens to be the foible of the day, and his invulnera∣bility
will be at her feet, and, Lady Clarendel be
brought forward in a fortnight.”</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney now entered the shop, accompanying
a lady whose countenance and appearance were singu∣larly
pleasing, and who, having made some purchase,
was quietly retiring, when the master of the shop in∣quired
if she wished to look at the ear-rings; adding,
that though the number was full, he knew of one person,
who would give up her chance, in case it would oblige
a customer.</P>
<P>She answered she had no present occasion for ear-rings,
and would not therefore take up either his time or her
own unnecessarily; and then walked gently away, still
attended by Lord O'Lerney.</P>
<P>“Bless me.” cried Mrs. Arlbery, “who is that? to
hear a little plain common sense is so rare, it strikes one
more than wit.”</P>
<P>“It's Lady Isabella Irby, madam,” answered the mas∣ter
of the shop.</P>
<P>Here Lord O'Lerney, who had only handed her to
her carriage, returned.</P>
<P>“My Lord,” “cried Mrs. Arlbery,” “do you know
what a curiosity you brought in amongst us just now?”
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> woman of rank who looks round upon other peo∣ple
just as if she thought they were her fellow crea∣tures?”</P>
<P>“Fie, fie!” answered Lord O'Lerney, laughing,
“why will you suppose that so rare? If we have not
as many women who are amiable with titles as without,
it is only because we have not the same number from
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
which to select them. They are spoilt or unspoilt, but
in the same proportion as the rest of their sex. Their
fall, or their escape, is less local than you imagine; it
does not depend upon their titles, but upon their under∣standings.”</P>
<P>“Well, my Lord, I believe you are right. I was
adopting a narrow prejudice, merely from indolence of
thought.”</P>
<P>“But why, my lord,” cried Sir Sedley, “does this pa∣ragon
of a divinity deny her example to the world? Is
it in contempt of our incorrigibility? or in horror of our
contagion?”</P>
<P>“My dear Sir Sedley,” said Mrs. Arlbery, `don't
flatter yourself with being so dangerous. Her ladyship
does not fly you from fear, take my word for it. There
is nothing in her air that looks as if she could only be
good by being shut up. I dare believe she could meet
you every day yet be mistress of herself? Neverthe∣less,
why, my lord, is she such a recluse? Why does
one never see her at the rooms?”</P>
<P>“Never see her there, my dear madam! she is there
almost every night; only being unintruding, she is un∣noticed.”</P>
<P>“The satire, then, my lord,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
“falls upon the company. Why is she not surrounded
by volunteer admirers? Why, with a person and man∣ner
so formed to charm, joined to such a character, and
such rank, has she not her train?”</P>
<P>“The reason, my dear madam, you could define
with more sagacity than myself; she must be sought! And
the world is so lazy, that the most easy of access, how∣ever
valueless, is preferred to the most perfect, who must
be pursued with any trouble.”</P>
<P>Admirable Lord O'Lerney! thought Edgar, what a
lesson is this to youthful females against the glare of
public homage, the false brilliancy of unfeminine popu∣larity?</P>
<P>This conversation, however, which alone of any
he had heard at Tunbridge promised him any pleasure,
was interrupted by Mr. Dennel, who said the dinner
would be spoilt, if they did not all go home.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="168"/>
Camilla felt extremely vexed to quit the shop, with∣out
clearing up the history of the dance; and Edgar,
seeing the persevering Major at her side as she departed,
in urgency to put any species of period to his own suf∣ferings,
followed the party, and precipitately began a dis∣course
with Lord O'Lerney upon making the tour of
Europe. Camilla, for whom it was designed, in∣tent
upon planning her own defence, heard nothing
that was said, till Lord O Lerney asked him if his route
would be through Switzerland, and he answered: “My
route is not quite fixed, my lord.”</P>
<P>Startled, she now listened, and Mrs. Arlbery, whom
she held by the arm, was equally surprised, and looked
to see how she bore this intimation.</P>
<P>“If you will walk with me to my lodgings,” replied
Lord O'Lerney, “I will shew you my own route, which
may perhaps save you some difficulties. Shall you set
out soon?”</P>
<P>“I fancy within a month,” answered Edgar;
and, arm in arm, they walked away together, as Ca∣milla
and her party quitted the Pantiles for Mount
Pleasant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Counsels for Conquest.</HEAD>
<P>FORTUNATELY for Camilla, no eye was upon
her at this period but that of Mrs Arlbery; her changed
countenance, else, must have betrayed still more wide∣ly
her emotion. Mrs. Arlbery saw it with real concern,
and saying she had something to consult her about, hur∣ried
on with her alone.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169"/>
Camilla scarce knew what she did, or what she suf∣fered;
the suddenness of surprise, which involved so
severe a disappointment, almost stupified her faculties.
Mrs. Arlbery did not utter one word by the way, and,
when they arrived at home, saw her to her chamber,
pressed her hand, and left her.</P>
<P>She now from a sense of shame, came to her full re∣collection.
She was convinced all her feelings were
understood by Mrs. Arlbery; she thought over what her
father had said upon such exposures, and hopeless of
any honorable end to her suspences, earnestly wished
herself back at Etherington, to hide in his revered breast
her confusion and grief.</P>
<P>Even Mrs. Arlbery she now believed had been mis∣taken;
Edgar appeared never to have loved her; his
attentions, his kindess, had all flowed from friendship;
his solicitude, his counsel had been the result of family
regard.</P>
<P>When called to dinner, she descended with downcast
eyes. She found no company invited; she felt thankful,
yet abashed; and Mrs. Arlbery let her retire when the
meal was over, but soon followed to beg she would pre∣pare
for the play.</P>
<P>She saw her hastily putting away her handherchief,
and dispersing her tears. “Ah! my dear,” cried she,
taking her hand, “I am afraid this old friend of yours
does not much contribute to make Tunbridge Wells
salubrious to you!”</P>
<P>Camilla, affecting not to understand her, said she
had never been in better health.</P>
<P>“Of mind, do you mean, or body?” cried Mrs.
Arlbery, laughing; but seeing she only redoubled her
distress, more seriously added, “Will you suffer me, my
dear Miss Tyrold, to play the old friend, also, and speak
to you with openness?”</P>
<P>Camilla durst not say no, though she feared to say
yes.</P>
<P>“I must content myself with a tacit compliance, if
I can obtain no other. I am really uneasy to talk with
you; not, believe me, from officiousness nor imperti∣nence,
but from a persuasion I may be able to promote
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
your happiness. You won't speak, I see? And you
judge perfectly right; for the less you disclaim, the less
I shall torment you. Permit me, therefore, to take for
granted that you are already aware I am acquainted
with the state of your heart.”</P>
<P>Camilla, trembling, had now no wish but to fly; she
fastened her eyes upon the door, and every thought
was devoted to find the means of her escape.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, if you look frightened in sober sadness,
I am gone. But shall I think less, or know less, for
saying nothing? It is not speech, my dear Miss Ty∣rold,
that makes detections: It only proclaims them.”</P>
<P>A sigh was all the answer of Camilla: though, as∣sured,
thus, she had nothing to gain by slight, she
forced herself to stay.</P>
<P>“We understand one another, I see, perfectly. Let
me now, then, as unaffectedly go on, as if the grand
explanation had been verbally made. That your fancy,
my fair young friend, has hit upon a tormentor, I will
not deny; yet not upon an ingrate; for this person,
little as you seem conscious of your power, certainly
loves you.”</P>
<P>Surprised off all sort of guard, Camilla exclaimed,
“O no!—O no!”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery smiled, but went on. “Yes, my
dear, he undoubtedly does you that little justice; yet,
if you are not well advised his passion will be unavail∣ing;
and your artlessness, your facility, and your in∣nocence,
with his knowledge, nay, his very admirati∣on
of them, will operate but to separate you.”</P>
<P>Glowing with opposing yet strong emotions at these
words, the countenance of Camilla asked an explana∣tion,
in defiance of her earnest desire to look indiffer∣ent
or angry.</P>
<P>“You will wonder, and very naturally, how such
attractions should work as repulses; but I will be plain
and clear, and you must be candid and rational, and
forgive me. These attractions, my dear, will be the
source of this mischief, because he sees, by their means,
that you are undoubtedly at his command.”</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
“No, madam! no Mrs. Arlbery!” cried Camilla,
in whose pride now every other feeling was concen∣trated,
“he does not, cannot see it!—”</P>
<P>“I would not hurt you for the world, my very
amiable young friend; but pardon me if I say, that not
to see it—he must be blinder than I imagine him!—
blinder than—to tell you the truth, I am much in∣clined
to think any of his race.”</P>
<P>Confounded, irritated, and wounded, Camilla re∣mained
a moment silent, and then, though scarce arti∣culately,
answered: “If such is your opinion—at least
he shall see it—fancy it. I mean—no more!—”</P>
<P>“Keep to that resolution, and you will behold him
—where he ought to be—at your feet.”</P>
<P>Irresistibly, though most unwillingly appeased by
this unexpected conclusion, she turned away to hide a
blush in which anger had not solely a place, and suffered
Mrs. Arlbery to go on.</P>
<P>“There is but one single method to make a man of
his ruminating class know his own mind: give him
cause to fear he will lose you. Animate, inspirit, in∣spire
him with doubt.”</P>
<P>“But why, ma'am,” cried Camilla, in a faultering
voice; why shall you suppose I will take any method
at all?”</P>
<P>“The apprehension you will take none is the very
motive that urges me to speak to you. You are young
enough in the world to think men come of them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves.
But you are mistaken, my dear. That happens rare∣ly;
except with inflamed and hot-headed boys, whose
passions are in their first innocence as well as violence.
Mandlebert has already given the dominion of his to
other rulers, who will take more care of his pride,
though not of his happiness. Attend to one who has
travelled further into life than yourself, and believe me
when I assert, that his bane, and yours alike is his se∣curity.”</P>
<P>With a colour yet deeper than ever Camilla resent∣fully
repeated “Security!”</P>
<P>“Nay, how can he doubt? with a situation in life
such as his—”</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172"/>
“Situation in life! Do you think he can ever sup∣pose
that would have the least, the most minute weight
with me?”</P>
<P>“Why, it would be a very shocking supposition, I
allow! but yet, some how or other, that same fordid
thing called money, does manage to produce such abun∣dance
of little comforts and pretty amusements, that
one is apt—to half suspect—it may really not much
add to any matrimonial aversion.”</P>
<P>The very idea of such a suspicion offended Camilla
beyond all else that had passed; Mrs. Arlbery appear∣ed
to her indelicate, unkind, and ungenerous, and re∣gretting
she had ever seen, and repenting she had ever
known her, she sunk upon a chair in a passionate burst
of tears.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery embraced her, begged her pardon a
thousand times; assured her all she had uttered was the
effect of esteem as well as of affection, since she saw
her too delicate, and too inexperienced, to be aware
either of the dangers or the advantages surrounding
her; and that very far from meaning to hurt her, she
had few things more at heart than the desire of prov∣ing
the sincerity of her regard, and endeavouring to
contribute to her happiness.</P>
<P>Camilla thanked her, dried her eyes, and strove to
appear composed; but she was too deeply affected for
internal consolation: she felt herself degraded in being
openly addressed as a love-sick girl; and injured in be∣ing
supposed, for a moment, capable of any merce∣nary
view. She desired to be excused going out, and
to have the evening to herself; not on account of the
expence of the play; she had again wholly forgotten her
poverty; but to breathe a little alone, and in dulge
the sadness of her mind.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, unfeignedly sorry to have caused her
any pain, would not oppose her inclination; she repeat∣ed
her apologies, dragged from her an assurance of for∣giveness,
and went down stairs alone to a summons from
Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>The first moments of her departure were spent by
Camilla in the deepest dejection; from which, however,
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
the recollection of her father, and her solemn engage∣ment
to him, soon after awakened her. She read again
his injunctions, and resolving not to add to her unhap∣piness
by any failure in her duty, determined to make
her appearance with some spirit before Mrs. Arlbery set
out.</P>
<P>“My dear Clarendel,” cried that lady, as she en∣tered
the parlour, “this poor little girl is in a more
serious plight than I had conjectured. I have been
giving her a few hints, from the stores of my worldly
knowledge, and they appear to her so detestably mean
and vulgar, that they have almost broken her heart.
The arrival of this odious Mandlebert has overthrown
all our schemes. We are cut up, Sir Sedley! com∣pletely
cut up!”</P>
<P>“O, indubitably to a degree!” cried the Baronet,
with an air of mingled pique and conceit; “how
could it be otherwise? Exists the wight who could
dream of competition with Mandlebert!”</P>
<P>“Nay, now, my dear Clarendel, you enchant me.
If you view his power with resentment, you are the man
in the world to crumble it to the dust. To work,
therefore, dear creature, without delay.”</P>
<P>“But how must I go about it? a little instruction,
for pity!”</P>
<P>“Charming innocent! So you don't know how to
try to make yourself agreeable?”</P>
<P>“Not in the least! I am ignorant to a redundance.”</P>
<P>“And were you never more adroit?”</P>
<P>“Never. A goth in grain! Witless from the first
<HI>muling in my nurse's arms!</HI>”</P>
<P>“Come, come, a truce for a moment, with foppery,
and answer me seriously; Were you ever in love, Cla∣rendel?
speak the truth. I am just seized with a pas∣sionate
desire to know.”</P>
<P>“Why—yes—” answered he, pulling his lips with
his fingers, “I think,—I rather think—I was once.”</P>
<P>“O tell! tell! tell!”</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
“Nay, I am not very positive. One hears it is to
happen; and one is put upon thinking of it, while so
very young, that one soon takes it for granted. De∣fine
it a little, and I can answer you more accurately.
Pray, is it any thing beyond being very fond, and
very silly, with a little touch of melancholy?”</P>
<P>“Precise! precise! Tell me, therefore, what it
was that caught you. Beauty? Fortune? Flattery?
or Wit? Speak! speak! I die to know!”</P>
<P>“O, I have forgotten all that these hundred years!
I have not the smallest trace left!”</P>
<P>“You are a terrible coxcomb, my dear Clarendel!
and I am a worse myself for giving you so much encou∣ragement.
But, however, we must absolutely do some∣thing
for this fair and dropping violet. She won't go
even to the play to-night.”</P>
<P>“Lovely lilly! how shall we rear it? Tell her I beg
her to be of our party.”</P>
<P>“You beg her? My dear Sir Sedley! what do you
talk of?”</P>
<P>“Tell her 'tis my intreaty, my supplication!”</P>
<P>“And you think that will make her comply?”</P>
<P>“You will see.”</P>
<P>“Bravo, my dear Clarendel, bravo! However, if
you have the courage to send such a message, I have not
to deliver it: but I will write it for you.”</P>
<P>She then wrote,</P>
<P>“Sir Sedley Clarendel asserts, that if you are not
as inexorable as you are fair, you will not refuse to
join our little party to night at the theatre.”</P>
<P>Camilla, after a severe conflict from this note, which
she concluded to be the mere work of Mrs. Arlbery
to draw her from retirement, sent word she would wait
upon her.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley heard the answer with exultation, and
Mrs. Arlbery with surprise. She declared, however,
that since he possessed this power, she should not suffer
it to lie dormant, but make it work upon her fair friend,
till it either excited jealousy in Mandlebert, or brought
indifference to herself. “My resolution,” cried she,
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
“is fixt; either to see him at her feet, or drive him
from her heart.”</P>
<P>Camilla, presently descending, looked away from
Mrs. Arlbery; but, unsuspicious as she was undesign∣ing,
thanked the Baronet for his message, and told him
she had already repented her solitary plan. The Ba∣ronet
felt but the more flattered, from supposing this
was said from the fear of flattering him.</P>
<P>In the way to the theatre, Camilla, with much con∣fusion,
recollected her empty purse; but could not, be∣fore
Mr. and Miss Dennel and Sir Sedley, prevail with
herself to make it known; she could only determine
to ask Mrs. Arlbery to pay for her at present, and de∣fer
the explanation till night.</P>
<P>But, just as she alighted from the coach, Mrs. Arl∣bery,
in her usual manner, said: “Do pay for me,
good Dennel; you know how I hate money.”</P>
<P>Camilla, hurrying after her, whispered, “May I
beg you to lend me some silver?”</P>
<P>“Silver! I have not carried any about with me since
I lost my dear ponies and my pet phaeton. I am as
poor as Job; and therefore bent upon avoiding all temp∣tation.
Somebody or other always trusts me. If they
get paid, they bless their stars. If not,—do your hear
me, Mr. Dennel?—'twill be all the same an hundred
years hence; so what man of any spirit will think of it?
hey, Mr. Dennel?”</P>
<P>“But—dear madam!—pray—”</P>
<P>“O, they'll change for you, here, my dear, with∣out
difficulty.”</P>
<P>“But—but—pray stop!—I—I have no gold nei∣ther!”</P>
<P>“Have you done like me, then, come out without
your purse?”</P>
<P>“No!—”</P>
<P>This single negative, and the fluttered manner, and
low voice in which it was pronounced, gave Mrs. Arl∣bery
the utmost astonishment. She said nothing, how∣ever,
but called aloud to Mr. Dennel to settle for the
whole party.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
Mr. Dennel, during the dialogue, had paid for him∣self
and his daughter, and walked on into the box.</P>
<P>“What a Hottentot!” exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery.
“Come, then, Clarendel, take pity on two poor dis∣tressed
objects, and let us pass.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, little suspicious of the truth, yet flattered
to be always called upon to be the banker of Camilla,
obeyed with alacrity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery placed Camilla upon a seat before her,
and motioned to the Baronet to remain in a row above;
and then, in a low voice, said: “My dear Clarendel,
do you know they have let that poor girl come to Tun∣bridge
without a sixpence in her pocket!”</P>
<P>“Is it possible?”</P>
<P>“'Tis a fact. I never suspected it till suspicion
was followed by confirmation. She had a guinea or
two, I fancy, at first, just to equip her with one set of
things to appear in; which, probably, the good Parson
imagined would last as clean and as long at a public
place as at his parsonage-house, where my best suit is
worn about twice in a summer. But how that rich old
uncle of hers could suffer her to come without a penny,
I can neither account for nor forgive. I have seen her
shyness about money-matters for some days past; but I
so little conjectured the possibility of her distress, that I
have always rather increased than spared it.”</P>
<P>“Sweet little angel!” exclaimed the Baronet, in a
tone of tenderness; “I had indeed no idea of her situ∣ation.
Heavens! I could lay half my fortune at her
feet to set her at ease!”</P>
<P>“Half, my dear Clarendel!” cried Mrs. Arlbery,
laughing; “nay, why not the whole? where will you
find a more lovely companion?”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho!—but why should it be so vastly horrid
an incongruity that a man who, by chance, is rich,
should do something for a woman who, by chance, is
poor? How immensely impertinent is the prejudice that
forbids so natural a use of money! why should the bet∣ter
half of a man's actions be always under the domi∣nion
of some prescriptive slavery? 'Tis hideous to think
of. And how could he more delectably spend, or more
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
extatically enjoy his fortune, than by so equitable a par∣ticipation?”</P>
<P>“True, Sir Sedley. And you men are all so disin∣terested,
so pure in your benevolence, so free from any
spirit of encroachment, that no possible ill consequence
could ensue from such an arrangement. When once a
fair lady had made you a civil courtesy, you would whol∣ly
forget you had ever obliged her. And you would
let her walk her ways and forget it also: especially if,
by chance, she happened to be young and pretty.”</P>
<P>This raillery was interrupted by the appearance of
Edgar in an opposite box. “Ah!” cried Mrs. Arlbe∣ry,
“look but at that piece of congelation that nothing
seems to thaw! Enter the lists against him, dear Cla∣rendel!
He has stationed himself there merely to watch
and discountenance her. I hate him heartily; yet he
rolls in wealth, and she has nothing. I must bring
them, therefore, together, positively: for though a
husband—such a fastidious one especially—is not what
I would recommend to her for happiness, 'tis better
than poverty. And, after his cold and selfish manner,
I am convinced he loves her. He is evidently in pur∣suit
of her, though he wants generosity to act openly.
Work him but with a little jealousy, and you will find
me right.”</P>
<P>“Me, my dear madam? me, my divine Mrs. Arlbery?
Alas! with what chance? No! see where enters the
gallant Major. Thence must issue those poignant darts
that newly vivify the expiring embers of languishing
love.”</P>
<P>“Now don't talk such nonsense when I am really
serious. You are the very man for the purpose: be∣cause,
though you have no feeling, Mandlebert does
not know you are without it. But those Officers are too
notoriously unmeaning to excite a moment's real appre∣hension.
They have a new dulcinea wherever they
newly quarter, and carry about the few ideas they pos∣sess
from damsel to damsel, as regularly as from town
to town.”</P>
<P>The Major was now in the box, and the conversation
ended.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178"/>
He endeavoured, as usual, to monopolize Camilla;
but while her thoughts were all upon Edgar, the whole
she could command of her attention was bestowed upon
Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>This was not unobserved by Edgar, who now again
wavered in believing she loved the Major: but the doubt
brought with it no pleasure; it led him only the more
to contemn her. Does she turn, thought he, thus,
from one to the other, with no preference but of acci∣dent
or caprice? Is her favour thus light of circulati∣on?
Is it now the mawkish Major, and now the cox∣comb
Clarendel? Already is she thus versed in the com∣mon
dissipation of conquetry?—O, if so, how blest has
been my escape! A coquette wife!—</P>
<P>His heart swelled, and his eye no longer sought
her.</P>
<P>At night, as soon as she went to her own room, Mrs.
Arlbery followed her, and said: “My dear Miss Ty∣rold,
I know much better than you how many six-pences
and three-pences are perpetually wanted at places such
as these. Do suffer me to be your banker. What shall
we begin our account with?”</P>
<P>Camilla felt really thankful for being spared an open∣ing
upon this subject: She consented to borrow two
guineas; but Mrs. Arlbery would not leave her with
less than five, adding, “I insist upon doubling it in a
day or two. Never mind what I say about my distress,
and my phaeton, and my ponies; 'tis only to torment
Dennel, who trembles at parting with half-a-crown for
half an hour; or else, now and then, to set other peo∣ple
a staring; which is not unamusing, when nothing
else is going forward. But believe me, my dear young
friend, were I really in distress, or were I really not to
discharge these petty debts I incur, you would soon dis∣cover
it by the thinness of our parties! These men that
now so flock around us, would find some other load∣stone.
I know them pretty well, dear creatures!—”</P>
<P>Though shocked to appear thus destitute, Camilla
was somewhat relieved to have no debt but with Mrs.
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
Arlbery; for she resolved to pay Sir Sedley and the
milliner the next day, and to settle with Mrs. Arlbery
upon her return to Etherington.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Strictures upon the Ton.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day was appointed for the master of the
ceremonies' ball; which proved a general rendezvous
of all parties, and almost all classes of company.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, in a morning visit to Camilla, found
out that she had only the same cap for this occasion that
she had worn upon every other; and, assuring her it
was grown so old-fashioned, that not a lady's maid in
Tunbridge would now be seen in it, she offered to pin
her up a turban, which should come to next to nothing,
yet should be the prettiest, and simplest, and cheapest
thing that ever was seen.</P>
<P>Camilla, though a stranger to vanity, and without
any natural turn to extravagance▪ was neither of an age,
nor a philosophy, to be unmoved by the apprehension of
being exposed to ridicule from her dress: she thankful∣ly,
therefore, accepted the proposal; and Mrs. Mittin,
taking a guinea, said, she would pay Mrs. Tillden for
the hat, at the same time that she bought a new hand∣kerchief
for the turban.</P>
<P>When she came back, however, she had only laid out
a few shillings at another shop, for some articles, so
cheap, she said it would have been a shame not to buy
them; but without paying the bill, Mrs. Tillden having
desired it might not be discharged till the young lady
was leaving the Wells.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180"/>
As the turban was made up from a pattern of one
prepared for Mrs. Berlinton, Camilla had every reason
to be satisfied of its elegance. Nor did Mrs. Mittin in∣volve
her in much distress how her own trouble might
be recompensed; the cap she found unfit for Camilla,
she could contrive, she said, to alter for herself; and as
a friend had given her a ticket for the ball, it would be
mighty convenient to her, as she had nothing of the kind
ready.</P>
<P>Far different were the sensations with which Edgar
and Camilla saw each other this night, from those with
which, so lately they had met in the same apartment.
Edgar thought her degenerating into the character of a
conquette, and Camilla, in his intended tour, anticipat∣ed
a period to all their intercourse.</P>
<P>She was received, meanwhile, in general, with pe∣culiar
and flattering attention. Sir Sedley Clarendel
made up to her, with public smiles and courtesy; even
Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard, though they
passed by Mrs. Arlbery without speaking to her, singled
out Camilla for their devoirs. The distinction paid her
by the admired Mrs. Berlinton had now not only
marked her as an object whom it would not be deroga∣tory
to treat with civility, but as one who might, hence∣forward,
be regarded herself as admitted into <HI>certain
circles.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, though every way a woman of fashion,
they conceived to be somewhat wanting in <HI>ton,</HI> since she
presided in no party, was unnoticed by Lady Alithea
Selmore, and unknown to Mrs Berlinton.</P>
<P><HI>Ton,</HI> in the scale of connoisseurs in the <HI>certain cir∣cles,</HI>
is as much above fashion, as fashion is above for∣tune:
for though the latter is an ingredient that all alike
covet to possess, it is courted without being respected,
and desired without being honoured, except only by
those who, from earliest life, have been taught to earn
it as a business. <HI>Ton,</HI> meanwhile, is as attainable with∣out
birth as without understanding, though in all the
<HI>certain circles</HI> it takes place of either. To define what
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
it is, would be as difficult to the most renowned of its
votaries, as to an utter stranger to its attributes. That
those who call themselves of the <HI>ton</HI> either lead, or hold
cheap all others, is obtrusively evident: but how and by
what art they attain such pre-eminence, they would be
perplexed to explain. That some whim has happily
called forth imitators; that some strange phrase has been
adopted; that something odd in dress has become popu∣lar;
that some beauty, or some deformity, no matter
which, has found annotators; may commonly be traced
as the origin of their first public notice. But to which∣ever
of these accidents their early fame may be attri∣buted,
its establishment and its glory is built upon vani∣ty
that knows no deficiency, or insolence that knows no
blush.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding her high superiority both in capacity
and knowledge, Mrs. Arlbery felt piqued by this beha∣viour,
though she laughed at herself for heeding it.
“Nevertheless,” cried she, “those who shew con∣tempt,
even though themselves are the most contempti∣ble,
always seem on the higher ground. Yet 'tis only,
with regard to these animals of the <HI>ton,</HI> that nobody
combats them. Their presumption is so notorious, that,
either by disgust or alarm, it keeps off reprehension.
Let any one boldly, and face to face, venture to be
more uncivil than themselves, and they would be over∣powered
at once. Their valour is no better than that
of a barking cur, who affrights all that go on without
looking at him, but who, the moment he is turned up∣on
with a stamp and a fierce look, retreats himself,
amazed, afraid, and ashamed.”</P>
<P>“If you, Mrs. Arlbery,” said the General, “would
undertake to tutor them, what good you might do!”</P>
<P>“O, Heavens, General, suspect me not of such re∣forming
Quixotism! I have not the smallest desire to do
them any good, believe me! If nature has given them
no sense of propriety, why should I be more liberal? I
only want to punish them; and that not, alas! from
virtue, put from spite!”</P>
<P>The conversation of the two men of the <HI>ton</HI> with Ca∣milla
was soon over. It was made up of a few dis∣jointed
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
sentences, abusing Tunbridge, and praising the
German Spa, in cant words, emphatically and conceit∣edly
pronounced, and brought round upon every occa∣sion,
and in every speech, with so precise an exclusion
of all other terms, that their vocabulary scarce consisted
of forty words in totality.</P>
<P>Edgar occupied the space they vacated the moment of
their departure; but not alone; Mrs Mittin came into
it with him, eager to tell Camilla how every body had
admired her turban; how sweetly she looked in it; how
every body said, they should not have known her again,
it became her so; and how they all agreed her head had
never been so well dressed before.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he could be heard, began speaking of
Sir Sedley Clarendel; he felt miserable in what he
thought her inconsiderate encouragement of such imper∣tinence;
and the delicacy which restrained him from
expressing his opinion of the Major had no weight with
him here, as jealousy had no share in his dislike to the
acquaintance: he believed the young Baronet in capable
of all love but for himself, and a decidedly destined ba∣chelor:
without, therefore, the smallest hesitation, he
plainly avowed that he had never met with a more tho∣roughly
conceited fop, a more elaborate and self-suffici∣ent
coxcomb.</P>
<P>“You see him only,” said Camilla, “with the im∣pression
made by his general appearance; and that is all
against him: I always look for his better qualities and
rejoice in finding them, His very sight fills me with
grateful pleasure, by reminding me of the deliverance I
owe to him.”</P>
<P>Edgar, amazed, intreated an explanation; and,
when she had given it, struck and affected, clasped his
hands, and exclaimed: “How providential such a
rescue! and how differently shall I henceforth behold
him!” And almost involuntarily turning to Mrs. Arl∣bery,
he intreated to be presented to the young Baronet.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley received his overtures with some surprise,
but great civility; and then went on with a ludicrous
account he was giving to Lord Newford and Sir Theo∣philus,
of the quarrel of Macdersey with Mr. Dubster.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>
“How awake thou art grown, Clary?” cried Sir
Theophilus; “A little while ago thou wast all hip and
vapour; and now thou dost nothing but patronise fun.”</P>
<P>“Why, yes,” answered the Baronet, “I begin to
tire of <HI>ennui.</HI> 'Tis grown so common. I saw my foot∣man
beginning it but last week.”</P>
<P>“O, hang it! O, curse it!” cried Lord Newford,
“your footman!”</P>
<P>“Yes, the rogue is not without parts. I don't
know if I shan't give him some lessons, upon leaving it
off myself. The only difficulty is to find out what, in
this nether world, to do without it. How can one fill
up one's time? Stretching, yawning, and all that, are
such delicious ingredients for coaxing on the hazy
hours!”</P>
<P>“O, hang it, O, curse it,” cried Lord Newford;
“who can exist without them? I would not be bound
to pass half an hour without yawning and stretching for
the Mogul's empire I'd rather snap short at once.”</P>
<P>“No, no, don't snap short yet, little Newry,” cri∣ed
Sir Sedley. “As to me, I am never at a loss for
an expedient. I am not without some thoughts of fall∣ing
in love.”</P>
<P>He looked at Edgar; who, not aware this was de∣signed
to catch his attention, naturally exclaimed:
“Thoughts! can you choose, or avoid at pleasure?”</P>
<P>“Most certainly. After four-and-twenty a man is
seldom taken by surprise; at least, not till he is past
forty: and then, the fear of being too late, sometimes
renovates the eagerness of the first youth. But, in ge∣neral,
your willing slaves are boys.”</P>
<P>Edgar, laughing, begged a little information, how
he meant to put his thoughts in execution.</P>
<P>“Nothing so facile! 'Tis but to look at some fair
object attentively, to follow her with your eyes when
she quits the room; never to let them rest without
watching for her return; filling up the interval with a
few sights; to which, in a short time, you grow so ha∣bituated,
that they become natural; and then, before
you are aware, a certain solicitude and restlessness arise,
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
which the connoisseurs in natural history dub falling in
love.”</P>
<P>“These would be good hints,” said Edgar, “to
urge on waverers, who wish to persuade themselves to
marry.”</P>
<P>“O no, my dear sir! no! that's a mistake of the
first magnitude; no man is in love when he marries.
He may have loved before; I have even heard he has
sometimes loved after: but at the time never. There
is something in the formalities of the matrimonial prepa∣rations
that drive away all the little cupidons. They
rarely stand even a demand of consent—unless they
doubt obtaining it; but a settlement! Parchments!
Lawyers!—No! there is not a little Love in the Island
of Cyprus, that is not ready to lend a wing to set passi∣on,
inspiration, and tenderness to flight, from such ex∣cruciating
legalities.”</P>
<P>“Don't prose, Clary; don't prose,” cried Sir The∣ophilus,
gaping till his mouth was almost distorted.</P>
<P>“O, killing! O, murder!” cried Lord Newford;
“what dost talk of marriage for?”</P>
<P>“It seems, then,” said Edgar, “to be much the
same thing what sort of wife falls to a man's lot; whe∣ther
the woman of his choice, or a person he should
blush to own?”</P>
<P>“Blush!” repeated Sir Sedley, smiling; “no!
no! A man of any fashion never blushes for his wife,
whatever she may be. For his mistress, indeed, he may
blush: for if there are any small failings there, his
taste may be called in question.”</P>
<P>“Blush about a wife!” exclaimed Lord Newford;
“O, hang it! O, curse it! that's too bad!”</P>
<P>“Too bad, indeed,” cried Sir Theophilus; “I
can't possibly patronise blushing for a wife.”</P>
<P>“'Tis the same, then, also,” said Edgar, “how
she turns out when the knot is tied, whether well or
ill?”</P>
<P>“To exactitude! If he marry her for beauty, let
her prove what she may, her face offers his apology.
If for money, he needs none. But if, indeed, by some
queer chance, he marries with a view of living with
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
her, then, indeed, if his particularity gets wind, he
may grow a little anxious for the acquittal of his oddi∣ty,
in seeing her approved.”</P>
<P>“Approved! Ha! ha!” cried Lord Newford;
“a wife approved! That's too bad, Clary; that's too
bad!”</P>
<P>“Poor Clary, what art prosing about?” cried Sir
Theophilus. “I can't possibly patronise this prosing.”</P>
<P>The entrance of the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton and
her tain now interrupted this conversation; the young
Baronet immediately joined her; though not till he had
given his hand to Edgar, in token of his willingness to
cultivate his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Edgar, returning to Camilla, confessed he had too
hastily judged Sir Sedley, when he concluded him a
fool, as well as a fop; “For,” added he, with a smile,
“I see, now, one of those epithets is all he merits.
He is certainly far from deficient in parts, though he
abuses the good gifts of nature with such pedantry of
affectation and conceit.”</P>
<P>Camilla was now intent to clear the history of the
cotillon; when Mrs. Berlinton approaching, and, with
graceful fondness, taking her hand, entreated to be in∣dulged
with her society: and, since she meant not to
dance, for Edgar had not asked her, and the Major she
had refused, she could not resist her invitation. She
had lost her fear of displeasing Mrs. Arlbery by quitting
her, from conceiving a still greater, of wearying by re∣maining
with her.</P>
<P>Edgar, anxious both to understand and to discuss
this new connexion, hovered about the party with un∣remitting
vigilance. But, though he could not either
look at or listen to Mrs. Berlinton, without admiring
her, his admiration was neither free from censure of
herself, nor terrour for her companion: he saw her far
more beautiful than prudent, more amiable than digni∣fied.
The females in her group were few, and little
worthy notice; the males appeared, to a man, without
disguise, though not without restraint, her lovers. And
though no one seemed selected, no one seemed despised;
she appeared to admit their devoirs with little conside∣ration;
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
neither modestly retiring from power, nor vain∣ly
displaying it.</P>
<P>Camilla quitted not this enchantress till summoned
by Mrs. Arlbery; who, seeing herself again, from the
arrival of Lady Alithea Selmore, without any distin∣guished
party, that lady drawing into her circle all peo∣ple
of any consequence not already attracted by Mrs.
Berlinton, grew sick of the ball and the rooms, and
impatient to return home. Camilla, in retiring, pre∣sented,
folded in a paper, the guinea, half-guinea, and
silver, she had borrowed of Sir Sedley; who received
it without presuming at any contest; though not, after
what he had heard from Mrs. Arlbery, without reluc∣tance.</P>
<P>Edgar watched the instant when Camilla moved from
the gay group; but Mrs. Mittin watched it also; and,
approaching her more speedily, because with less em∣barrassment,
seized her arm before he could reach her:
and before he could, with any discretion, glide to her
other side, Miss Dennel was there.</P>
<P>“Well now, young ladies,” said Mrs. Mittin,
“I'm going to tell you a secret. Do you know, for
all I call myself Mrs. I'm single?”</P>
<P>“Dear, la!” exclaimed Miss Dennel; “and for
all you're so old!”</P>
<P>“So old, Miss! Who told you I was so old? I'm
not so very old as you may think me. I'm no particu∣lar
age, I assure you. Why, what made you think of
that?”</P>
<P>“La, I don't know; only you don't look very
young.”</P>
<P>“I can't help that, Miss Dennel. Perhaps you
mayn't look young yourself one of these days. People
can't always stand still just at a particular minute. Why
how old, now, do you take me to be? Come, be sin∣cere.”</P>
<P>“La! I'm sure I can't tell; only I thought you was
an old woman.”</P>
<P>“An old woman! Lord, my dear, people would
laugh to hear you. You don't know what an old wo∣man
is. Why it's being a cripple, and blind, and deaf,
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
and dumb, and slavering, and without a tooth. Pray,
how am I like all that?”</P>
<P>“Nay, I'm sure I don't know; only I thought, by
the look of your face, your must be monstrous old.”</P>
<P>“Lord, I can't think what you've got in your head,
Miss Dennel! I never heard as much before, since I
was born. Why the reason I'm called Mrs. is not be∣cause
of that, I assure you; but because I'd a mind to
be taken for a young widow, on account that every bo∣dy
likes a young widow; and if one is called Miss, peo∣ple
begin so soon to think one an old maid, that it's quite
disagreeable.”</P>
<P>This discourse brought them to the carriage.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Traits of Characters.</HEAD>
<P>THE following morning, Mrs. Mittin came with
eager intelligence, that the raffle was fixed for one
o'clock; and, without any scruple, accompanied the
party to the shop, addressing herself to every one of the
set as to a confirmed and intimate friend. But her
chief supporter was Mr. Dennel, whose praise of her
was the vehicle to his censure of his sister-in-law. That
lady was the person in the world whom he most feared
and disliked. He had neither spirit for the splendid
manner in which she lived, nor parts for the vivacity of
her conversation. The first, his love of money made
him condemn as extravagant, and the latter his self-love
made him hate, because he could not understand.
He persuaded himself, therefore, that she had more
words than meaning; and extolled all the obvious
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
truths uttered by Mrs. Mittin, to shew his superior ad∣miration
of what, being plain and incontrovertible, he
dignified with the panegyric of being sensible.</P>
<P>When they came upon the Pantiles, they were ac∣costed
by Mr. Dubster; who having solemnly asked
them, one by one, how they all did, joined Mrs. Mit∣tin,
saying; “Well, I can't pretend as I'm over sor∣ry
you've got neither of those two comical gentlemen
with you, that behaved so free to me for nothing. I
don't think it's particular agreeable being treated so;
though it's a thing I don't much mind. It's not worth
fretting about.”</P>
<P>“Well, don't say any more about it,” cried Mrs.
Mittin, endeavouring to shake him off; “I dare say
you did something to provoke 'em, or they're too gen∣teel
to have taken notice of you.”</P>
<P>“Me provoke them! why what did I do? I was
just like a mere lamb, as one may say, at the very time
that young Captain fell abusing me so, calling of me a
little dirty fellow, without no provocation. If I'm lit∣tle,
or big, I don't see that it's any business of his.
And as to dirty, I'd put on all clean linen but the very
day before, as the people can tell you at the inn; so
the whole was a mere piece of falsehood from one end
to t'other.”</P>
<P>“Well, well, what do you talk about it for any more?
You should never take any thing ill of a young gentle∣man.
It's only aggravating him so much the worse.”</P>
<P>“Aggravating him, Mrs. Mittin! why what need I
mind that? Do you think I'm to put up with his talk∣ing
of caning me, and such like, because of his being a
young gentleman? Not I, I assure you! I'm no such
person. And if once I feel his switch across these here
shoulders, it won't be so well for him!”</P>
<P>The party now entered the shop where the raffle was
to be held.</P>
<P>Edgar was already there; he had no power to keep
away from any place where he was sure to behold Ca∣milla;
and a raffle brought to his mind the most tender
recollections. He was now with Lord O'Lerney, in
whose candour and benevolence of character he took

<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
great delight, and with whom he had joined Lady Isa∣bella
Irby, who had been drawn, as a quiet spectatress,
to the sight, by a friend, who, having never seen the hu∣mours
of a raffle, had entreated, through her means,
to look on. He languished to see Camilla presented to
this lady, in whose manners and conversation, dignity
and simplicity were equally blended</P>
<P>While he was yet, though absently, conversing with
them, Lord O'Lerney pointed out Camilla to Lady Isa∣bella.</P>
<P>“I have taken notice of her already at the rooms;”
answered her Ladyship; and I have seldom, I think,
seen a more interesting young creature”</P>
<P>“The character of her countenance,” said Lord O'∣Lerney,
“strikes me very peculiarly. 'Tis so intelli∣gent,
yet so unhackneyed, so full of meaning, yet so art∣less,
that, while I look at her, I feel myself involunta∣rily
anxious for her welfare.”</P>
<P>“I don't think she seems happy,” said Lady Isabella;
“Do you know who she is, my Lord?”</P>
<P>Edgar, here, with difficulty suppressed a sigh. Not
happy! thought he; ah! wherefore? what can make
Camilla unhappy?</P>
<P>“I understand she is a niece of Sir Hugh Tyrold,”
answered his Lordship; “a Yorkshire Baronet. She
is here with an acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Arlbery,
who is one of the first women I have ever known, for
wit and capacity. She has an excellent heart, too;
though her extraordinary talents, and her carelessness of
opinion make it sometimes, but very unjustly, doubted.”</P>
<P>Edgar heard this with much pleasure. A good word
from Lord O'Lerney quieted many fears; he hoped he
had been unnecessarily alarmed; he determined, in fu∣ture,
to judge her more favourably.</P>
<P>“I should be glad,” continued his lordship, “to hear
this young lady were either well established, or returned
to her friends without becoming an object of public no∣tice.
A young woman is no where so rarely respect∣able,
or respected, as at these water-drinking places, if
seen at them either long or often. The search of plea∣sure
and dissipation, at a spot consecrated for restoring
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
health to the sick, the infirm, and the suffering, carries
with it an air of egotism, that does not give the most
pleasant idea of the feeling and disposition.”</P>
<P>“Yet, may not the sick, my lord, be rather amended
than hurt by the sight of gaiety around them?”</P>
<P>“Yes, my dear Lady Isabella; and the effect there∣fore,
I believe to be beneficial. But as this is not the
motive why the young and the gay seek these spots, it is
not here they will find themselves most honoured. And
the mixture of pain and illness with splendour and festi∣vity,
is so unnatural, that probably it is to that we must
attribute that a young woman is no where so hardly
judged. If she is without fortune, she is thought a fe∣male
adventurer, seeking to sell herself for its attain∣ment;
if she is rich, she is supposed a willing dupe,
ready for a snare, and only looking about for an en∣snarer.”</P>
<P>“And yet, young women, seldom, I believe, my
lord, merit this severity of judgment. They come but
hither in the summer, as they go to London in the win∣ter,
simply in search of amusement, without any particu∣lar
purpose.”</P>
<P>“True; but they do not weigh what their observers
weigh for them, that the search of public recreation in
the winter is, from long habit, permitted without cen∣sure;
but that the summer has not, as yet, prescription so
positively in its favour; and those who, after meeting
them all the winter at the opera, and all the spring at
Renelagh hear of them all the summer at Cheltenham,
Tunbridge, &amp;c. and all the autumn at Bath, are apt to
inquire, when is the season for home.”</P>
<P>“Ah, my lord! how wide are the poor inconsiderate
little flutterers from being aware of such a question! how
necessary to youth and thoughtlessness is the wisdom of
experience!”</P>
<P>Why does she not come this way? thought Edgar;
why does she not gather from these mild, yet under∣standing
moralists, instruction that might benefit all her
future life?</P>
<P>“There is nothing,” said Lord O'Lerney, “I more
sincerely pity than the delusions surrounding young fe∣males.
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
The strongest admirers of their eyes are fre∣quently
the most austere satirists of their conduct.”</P>
<P>The entrance of Lord Newford, Sir Theophilus Ja∣rard,
and Sir Sedley Clarendel, all noisily talking and
laughing together, interrupted any further conversation.
The two former no sooner saw Camilla, and perceived
neither Lady Alithea Selmore, nor Mrs. Berlinton, than
they made up to her; and Sir Sedley, who now found
she was completely established in the <HI>bon ton,</HI> felt some∣thing
of pride mix with pleasure in publicly availing
himself of his intimacy with her; and something like in∣terest
mix with curiosity, in examining if Edgar were
struck with her ready attention to him.</P>
<P>Upon Edgar, however, it made not the slightest im∣pression.
While Sir Sedley had appeared to him a mere
fop, he had thought it degraded her; but now he re∣garded
him as her preserver, it seemed both natural and
merited.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, not aware of this reasoning, was some∣what
piqued; and taking him to another part of the
shop, whispered: “I am horribly vapoured! Do you
know I have some thoughts of trying that little girl?
Do you think one could make any thing of her?”</P>
<P>“How? what do you mean?” cried Edgar, with
sudden alarm.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, a little flattered, affectedly answered:
“O, if you have any serious designs that way, incon∣testably
I won't interefere.”</P>
<P>“Me!” cried Edgar, surprised and offended; “be∣lieve
me, no! I have all my life considered her—as
my sister.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley saw this was spoken with effort; and neg∣ligently
replied: “Nay you are just at the first epocha
for marrying from inclination; but you are in the right
not to perform so soon the funeral honours of liberty.
'Tis what you may do at any time. So many girls
want establishments, that a man of sixty can just as ea∣sily
get a wife of eighteen, as a man of one-and-twenty.
The only inconvenience in that sort of alliance is, that
though she begins with submitting to her venerated hus∣band
as prettily as to her papa, she is terribly apt to have
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
a knack of running away from him, afterwards, with
equal facility.”</P>
<P>“That is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather a discouraging article I confess,”
cried Edgar, “for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardy votaries of Hymen!”</P>
<P>“O, no! 'tis no great matter!” answered he, pat∣ting
his snuff-box; “we are impenetrable in the ex∣treme
to those sort of grievances now-a-days. We are
at such prodigious expence of sensibility in public, for
tales of sorrow told about pathetically, at a full board,
that if we suffered much for our private concerns to
boot, we must always meet one another with tears in
our eyes. We never weep now, but at dinner, or at
some diversion.”</P>
<P>Lord Newford, pulling him by the arm, called out:
“Come, Clary▪ what art about, man? we want thee.”</P>
<P>“Come, Clary! don't shrink, Clary,” cried Sir
Theophilus; “I can't possibly patronise this skrinking.”
And they hauled him to a corner of the shop, where
all three resumed their customary laughing whispers.</P>
<P>“You will not, perhaps, suspect, Lady Isabella,”
said Lord O'Lerney, smiling, “that one of that tri∣umvirate
is by no means deficient in parts, and can even,
when he desires it, be extremely pleasing?”</P>
<P>“Your Lordship judges right, I confess! I had not,
indeed, done him such justice!”</P>
<P>“See then,” said his Lordship▪ “how futile an ani∣mal
is man, without some decided character and prin∣ciple!”</P>
<P>“He's every thing by turns, and nothing long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dryden's Absalom and Achytophel.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Wise, foolish; virtuous, vicious; active, indolent;
prodigal and avaricious! No contrast is too strong for
him while guided but by accident or impulse. This
gentleman also, in common with the rest of his <HI>tonnish</HI>
brethren, is now daily, though unconsciously, hoarding
up a world of unprepared-for mortification, by not fore∣seeing
that the more he is celebrated in his youth, for
being the leader of the <HI>ton,</HI> and the man of the day, the
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>
earlier he will be regarded as a creature out of date, an
old beau, and a fine gentleman of former times. But
'tis by reverses, such as these, that folly and impropriety
pay their penalties. We might spare all our anger
against the vanity of the beauty, or the conceit of the
coxcomb. Are not wrinkles always in waiting to pu∣nish
the one, and age, without honour, to chastise and
degrade the other?”</P>
<P>All the rafflers were now arrived except Mrs. Ber∣linton,
who was impatiently expected. Lady Alithea
Selmore had already sent a proxy to throw for her in
her own woman; much to the dissatisfaction of most
part of the company. A general rising and inquietude
to look out for Mrs. Berlinton, gave Edgar, at length,
an opportunity to stand next to Camilla. “How I
grieve,” he cried, “you should not know Lady Isa∣bella
Irby! she seems to me a model for a woman of
rank in her manners, and a model for a woman of
every station in her mind. The world, I believe,
could scarce have tempted her to so offensive a mark of
superiority as has just been exhibited by Lady Alithea
Selmore, who has ingeniously discovered a method
of being signalised as the most important person out of
twenty, by making herself nineteen enemies.”</P>
<P>“I wonder,” said Camilla, “she can think the
chance of the ear-rings worth so high a price!”</P>
<P>A footman, in a splendid livery, now entering, in∣quired
for Miss Tyrold. She was pointed out to him
by Major Cerwood, and he delivered her a letter from
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The contents were to intreat she would throw for
that lady, who was in the midst of Akenside's Plea∣sures
of the Imagination, and could not tear herself
away from them.</P>
<P>Camilla blushed excessively in proclaiming she was
chosen Mrs. Berlinton's proxy. Edgar saw with ten∣derness
her modest confusion, and, with a pleasure the
most touching, read the favourable impression it made
upon Lord O'Lerney and Lady Isabella.</P>
<P>This seemed an opportunity irressistible for venting
his fears and cautions about Mrs. Berlinton; and, tak∣ing
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
the bustling period in which the rafflers were ar∣ranging
the order and manner and of throwing, he
said, in a low, and diffident tone of voice, “You have
committed to me an important and, I fear, an importu∣nate
office; yet while I hold, I cannot persuade my∣self
not to fulfil it; though I know that to give advice
which opposes sentiment and feeling, is repugnant to in∣dependence
and to delicacy. Such, therefore, I do
not mean to enforce; but merely to offer hints—inti∣mations
—and observations—that without controlling,
may put you upon your guard.”</P>
<P>Camilla, affected by this unexpected address, could
only look her desire for an explanation.</P>
<P>“The lady,” he continued, “whom you are pre∣sently
to represent, appears to be uncommonly en∣gaging?—”</P>
<P>“Indeed she is! She is attractive, gentle, amiable.”</P>
<P>“She seems, also, already to have caught your af∣fection?”</P>
<P>“Who could have withheld it, that had seen her
as I have seen her? She is as unhappy as she is
lovely?—”</P>
<P>“I have heard of your first meeting, with as much
pleasure in the presence of mind it called forth on one
side, as with doubt and perplexity, upon every cir∣cumstance
I can gather of the other.—”</P>
<P>“If you knew her, you would find it impossible
to hold any doubts; impossible to resist admiring, com∣passionating,
and loving her!”</P>
<P>“If my knowledge of her bribed an interest in her
favour, without convincing me she deserved it, I ought
rather, to regret that you have not escaped falling into
such a snare, than that I could have escaped it myself.”</P>
<P>“I believe her free, nay incapable of all ill!” cried
Camilla warntly; “though I dare not assert she is al∣ways
coolly upon her guard.”</P>
<P>“Do not let me hurt you,” said Edgar, gently:
“I have seen how lovely she is in person, and how
pleasing in manners. And she is so young that, were
she in a situation less exposed, want of steadiness or
judgment might, by a little time, be set right. But
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>
here, there is surely much to fear from her early pos∣session
of power.—O, that some happier chance had
brought about such a peculiar intercourse for you with
Lady Isabella Irby! There, to the pleasure of friend∣ship,
might be added the modesty of retired elegance,
and the security of established respectability.”</P>
<P>“And may not this yet happen, with Mrs. Berlin∣ton?
Lady Isabella, though still young, is not in the
extreme youth of Mrs. Berlinton: a few more years,
therefore, may bring equal discretion; and as she
has already every other good quality, you may here∣after
equally approve her.”</P>
<P>“Do you think, then,” said Edgar, half smiling,
“that the few years of difference in their age were
spent by Lady Isabella in the manner they are now
spent by Mrs. Berlinton? do you think she paved the
way for her present dignified, though unassuming
character, by permitting herself to be surrounded by
professed admirers? by letting their sighs reach her
ears? by suffering their eyes to fasten with open rap∣ture
on her face? and by holding it sufficient not to
suppress such liberties, so long as she does not avowedly
encourage them?”</P>
<P>Camilla was startled. She had not seen her con∣duct
in this light: yet her understanding refused to de∣ny
it might bear this interpretation.</P>
<P>Charmed with the candour of her silence, Edgar
continued, “How wide from all that is open to simi∣lar
comment, is the carriage and behaviour of Lady
Isabella! how clear! how transparent, how free from
all conjecture of blemish! They may each, indeed,
essentially be equally innocent; and your opinion of
Mrs Berlinton corroborates the impression made by
her beautiful countenance: yet how far more highly
is the true feminine character preserved, where surmise
is not raised, than where it can be parried! Think but
of those two ladies, and mark the difference. Lady
Isabella, addressed only where known, followed only
because loved, sees no adulators encircling her, for adu∣lation
would alarm her; no admirers paying her ho∣mage,
for such homage would offend her. She knows
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
she has not only her own innocence to guard, but the ho∣nour
of her husband. Whether she is happy with him
or not, this deposit is equally sacred.—”</P>
<P>He stopt; for Camilla again started. The irrepres∣sible
frankness of her nature revolted against denying
how much this last sentence struck her, and she inge∣nuously
exclaimed: “O that this most amiable young
creature were but more aware of this duty!”</P>
<P>“Ah, my dear Miss Camilla,” cried Edgar, with
energy, “since you feel and own—and with you, that
is always one—this baneful deficiency, drop, or at
least suspend an intercourse too hazardous to be indulg∣ed
with propriety! See what she may be sometime
hence, ere you contract further intimacy. At present,
unexperienced and unsuspicious, her dangers may be
yours. You are too young for such a risk. Fly, fly
from it, my dear Miss Camilla!—as if the voice of your
mother were calling out to caution you!”</P>
<P>Camilla was deeply touched. An interest so warm
in her welfare was soothing, and the name of her mo∣ther
rendered it awaful; yet, thus united, it appeared to
her more strongly than ever to announce itself as mere∣ly
fraternal. She could not suppress a sigh; but he
attributed it to the request he had urged, and, with
much concern, added: “What I have asked of you,
then, is too severe?”</P>
<P>Again irresistibly sighing, yet collecting all her force
to conceal the secret cause, she answered, “If she
is thus exposed to danger—if her situation is so peri∣lous,
ought I not rather to stay by, and help to sup∣port
her, than by abandoning, perhaps contribute to the
evil you think awaiting her?”</P>
<P>“Generous Camilla,” cried he, melted into tender
admiration, “who can oppose so kind a design? So
noble a nature!—”</P>
<P>No more could be said, for all preliminaries had
been settled, and the throwing being arranged to take
place alphabetically, she was soon summoned to repre∣sent
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>From this time, Edgar could speak to her no more:
even the Major could scarcely make way to her: the
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
two men of the <HI>ton</HI> would not quit her, and Sir Sedley
Clarendel appeared openly devoted to her.</P>
<P>Edgar looked on with the keenest emotion. The proof
he had just received that her intrinsic worth was in its
first state of excellence, had come home to his heart,
and the fear of seeing her altered and spoilt, by the
flatteries and dangers which environed her, with his
wavering belief in her engagement with Major Cer∣wood,
made him more wretched than ever. But when
some time after, she was called upon to throw for her∣self,
the recollection that, from the former raffle, her
half-guinea, even when the prize was in her hand, had
been voluntarily withdrawn to be bestowed upon a poor
family, so powerfully affected him, that he could not
rest in the shop; he was obliged to breathe a freer air,
and to hide his disturbance by a retreat.</P>
<P>Her throw was the highest the dice had yet afforded.
A Miss Williams alone came after her, whose throw
was the lowest; Miss Camilla Tyrold, therefore, was
proclaimed to be the winner.</P>
<P>This second testimony of the favour of fortune was a
most pleasant surprize to Camilla, and made the room
resound with felicitations, till they were interrupted by
a violent quarrel upon the Pantiles, whence the voice
of Macdersey was heard, hollooing out: “Don't talk,
I say sir! don't presume to say a word!” and that of
Mr. Dubster angrily answering, he would talk as long
as he thought proper, whether it was agreeable or not.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley advanced to the combatants, in order to
help on the dispute; but Edgar returning at the sound
of high words, took the Ensign by the arm, and pre∣vailed
with him to accompany him up and down the
Pantiles; while Mrs. Mittin ran to Mr. Dubster, and
pulling him into the shop, said: “Mr. Dubster, if I'm
not ashamed of you! how can you forget yourself so?
talking to gentlemen at such a rate!”</P>
<P>“Why, what should hinder me?” cried he; “do
you think I shall put up with every thing as I used to
do when you first knew me, and we used to meet at
Mr. Typton's, the tallow chandler's in Shug-lane? no,
Mrs. Mittin, nor no such a thing; I'm turned gentleman
<PB N="197" REF="200"/>
myself, now, as much as the best of 'em; for I've no∣thing
to do, but just what I choose.”</P>
<P>“I protest, Mr. Dubster,” cried Mrs. Mittin,
taking him into a corner, “you're enough to put a saint
into a pet! how come you to think of talking of Mr.
Typton here? before such gentlefolks? and where's
the use of telling every body he's a tallow chandler?
and as to my meeting with you there once or so, in a
way, I desire you'll mention it no more; for it's so
long ago, I have no recollection of it.”</P>
<P>“No! why don't you remember—”</P>
<P>“Fiddle, faddle, what's the good of ripping up old
stories about nothing? when you're with genteel peo∣ple,
you must do as I do; never talk about business at
all.”</P>
<P>Macdersey now entered the shop, appeased by Ed∣gar
from shewing any further wrath, but wantonly in∣flamed
by Sir Sedley, in a dispute upon the passion of
love.</P>
<P>“Do you always, my dear friend,” said the Baronet,
“fall in love at first sight?”</P>
<P>“To be sure I do! If a man makes a scruple of
that, it's ten to one but he's disappointed of doing it
at all; because, after two or three second sights,
the danger is you may spy out fome little flaw in the
dear angel, that takes off the zest, and hinders you to
the longest day you have to live.”</P>
<P>“Profoundly cogitated that! you think then, my
vast dear sir, the passion had more conveniently be kind∣led
first, that the flaws may appear after to cure it.”</P>
<P>“No, sir, no! when a man's once in love, those
flaws don't signify, because he can't see them; or,
if hecould, at least he'd scorn to own them.”</P>
<P>“Live for ever brave Ireland!” exclaimed Mrs.
Arlbery; “what cold phlegmatic Englishman would
have made a speech of so much gallantry?”</P>
<P>“As to an Englishman,” said Macdersey, “you
must never mind what he says about the ladies,
because he's too sheepish to speak out. He's just as
often in love as his neighbours, only he's so shy he
won't own it, till he sees if the young fair one is as∣much
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
in love as himself; but a generous Irishman ne∣ver
scruples to proclaim the girl of his heart, though he
should have twenty in a year.”</P>
<P>“But is that perfectly delicate, my dearest sir, to the
several Dulcineas!”</P>
<P>“Perfectly! your Irishman is the delicatest man
upon earth to the fair sex; for he always talks of their
cruelty, if they are never so kind. He knows every
honest heart will pity him, if its true; and if it i'n't,
he is too much a man of honour not to complain all one;
he knows how agreeable it is to the dear creatures; they
always take it for a compliment.”</P>
<P>“Whether avowedly or clandestinely,” said Mrs.
Arlbery, “still you are all in our chains. Even where
you play the tyrant with us, we occupy all your
thoughts; and if you have not the skill to make us hap∣py,
your next delight is to make us miserable; for tho'
now and then, you can contrive to hate, you can never
arrive at forgetting us.”</P>
<P>“Contrive to hate you!” repeated Macdersey; “I
could as soon contrive to turn the world into a potatoe;
there is nothing upon earth, nothing under the whole
firmament I value but beauty!”</P>
<P>“A chearful glass, then,” said Sir Sedley, “you
think horridly intolerable?”</P>
<P>“A chearful glass, sir! do you take me for a milk∣sop?
do you think I don't know what it is to be a man?
a chearful glass, sir, is the first pleasure in life; the
most convivial, the most exhilirating, the most friendly
joy of a true honest soul! what were existence without
it? I should choose to be off in half an hour;
which I should only make so long, not to shock my
friends.”</P>
<P>“Well, the glass is not what I patronise,” said Sir
Theophilus; “it hips me so consumedly the next day;
no, I can't patronise the glass.”</P>
<P>“Not patronise wine?” cried Lord Newford; “O
hang it! O curse it! that's too bad, Offy! but hunting!
what dost think of that, little Offy?”</P>
<P>“Too obstreperous! It rouses one at such aukward
hours; no, I can't patronise hunting.”</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="202"/>
“Hunting!” cried Macdersey; “O, it leaves every
thing behind it; 'tis the thing upon the earth for
which I have the truest taste. I know nothing else that
is not a bauble to it. A man is no more, in my
estimation, than a child, or a woman, that don't enjoy
it.”</P>
<P>“Cards, then,” said Sir Sedley, “you repro∣bate?”</P>
<P>“And dice?”—cried Lord Newford—</P>
<P>“And betting?”—cried Sir Theophilus.</P>
<P>“Why what do you take me for, gentlemen?” re∣plied
Macdersey, hotly; “Do you think I have no
soul? no fire? no feeling? Do you suppose me a
stone? a block? a lump of lead? I scorn such suspi∣cions;
I don't hold them worth answering. I am
none of that torpid, morbid, drowsy tribe. I hold
nobody to have an idea of life that has not rattled in
his own hand the dear little box of promise. What
ecstasy not to know if in two seconds, one mayn't be
worth ten thousand pounds! or else without a farthing!
how it puts one on the rack! There's nothing to com∣pare
with it. I would not give up that moment to be
sovereign of the East Indies! no, not if the West were
to be put into the bargain.”</P>
<P>“All these things,” said Mr. Dennel, “are fit for
nothing but to bring a man to ruin. The main chance
is all that is worth thinking of. 'Tis money makes
the mare to go; and I don't know any thing that's to
be done without it.”</P>
<P>“Money!” exclaimed Macdersey, “'tis the thing
under heaven I hold in the most disdain. It won't
give me a moment's concern never to see its colour
again. I vow solemnly, if it were not just for the plea∣sures
of the table, and a jolly glass with a friend, and
a few horse in one's stable, and a little ready cash in
one's purse, for odd uses, I should not care if the mint
were sunk under ground to-morrow; money is what I
most despise of all.”</P>
<P>“That's talking out of reason,” said Mr. Dennel,
walking out of the shop with great disgust.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203"/>
“Why,” if I was to speak, “said Mr. Dubster, en∣couraged
to come forward, by an observation so much
to his own comprehension and taste as the last; “I
can't but say I think the same; for money—”</P>
<P>“Keep your distance, sir!” cried the fiery Ensign,
“keep your distance, I tell you! if you don't wish I
should say something to you pretty cutting.”</P>
<P>This broke up the party, which else the lounging
spirit of the place, and the general consent by which
all descriptions of characters seem determined to oc∣cupy
any spot whatever, to avoid a moment's abode in
their lodgings, would still have detained till the dinner
hour had forced to their respective homes. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sup∣press
all possibility of further dissention, Mrs. Arlbery
put Miss Dennel under the care of Macdersey, and bid
him attend her towards Mount Pleasant.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster, having stared after them some time in
silence, called out: “Keep my distance! I can't but
say but what I think that young Captain the rudest
young gentleman I ever happened to light upon! how∣ever,
if he don't like me, I shan't take it much to
heart; I can't pretend to say I like him any better; so
he may choose; it's much the same to me; it breaks
no squares.”</P>
<P>Edgar, almost without knowing it, followed Camilla,

who, one with a look of open exultation, and the other
with an air of determined perseverance, retained each
his post at her side.</P>

and that the Major had none but what was called
for and inevitable. Was this indifference, or security?

lamented he had not, at once, visited her; since it was
now awkward to take such a step without an invitation,

which she seemed by no means disposed to offer him.
She internally resented the little desire he had
ever manifested for her acquaintance; and they
had both too much penetration not to perceive
how wide either was from being the favourite of
the other.</P>
