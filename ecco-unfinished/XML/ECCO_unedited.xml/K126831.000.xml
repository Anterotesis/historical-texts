<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE History of this <HI>Beautiful Lady,</HI> is to speak for itself: If it is not as Beautiful as the Lady herself is reported to be; if it is not as diverting as the Reader can desire, and much more than he can reasonably expect; and if all the most diverting Parts of it are not a∣dapted to the Instruction and Improvement of the Reader, the <HI>Relator says,</HI> it must be from the Defect of his Performance; dressing up the Story in worse Cloaths than the <HI>Lady,</HI> whose Words he speaks, prepar'd it for the World.</P>
<P>He takes the Liberty to say, that this <HI>Story</HI> differs from most of the modern Performances of this Kind, tho' some of them have met with a very good Reception in the World: <HI>I say,</HI> It differs from them in this great and essential Article, <HI>Namely,</HI> that the Foundation of this<HI><PB REF="4"/></HI>is laid in Truth of <HI>Fact;</HI> and so the Work is not a Story, but a History.</P>
<P>The Scene is laid so near the Place where the main Part of it was transacted, that it was necessary to conceal Names and Persons; lest what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that Part of the Town, shou'd be remember'd, and the Facts trac'd back too plainly, by the many People yet living, who wou'd know the Persons by the Particulars.</P>
<P>It is not always necessary that the Names of Persons shou'd be discover'd, tho' the History may be many Ways useful; and if we shou'd be always oblig'd to name the Persons, or not to relate the Story, the Consequence might be only this, that many a pleasant and delightful History wou'd be buried in the Dark, and the World be depriv'd both of the Pleasure and the Profit of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Writer says,</HI> He was particularly ac∣quainted with this Lady's first Husband, <HI>the Brewer,</HI> and with his Father; and also, with his bad Circumstances; and knows that first Part of the Story to be Truth.</P>
<P>This may, he hopes, be a Pledge for the Credit of the rest, tho' the latter Part of her History lay abroad, and cou'd not so well be vouch'd as the First; yet, as she has told it her∣self, we have the less Reason to question the Truth of that Part also.</P>
<P>In the Manner she has told the Story, it is evident she does not insist upon her Justification<HI><PB REF="5"/></HI>in any one Part of it; much less does she recom∣mend her Conduct, or indeed, any Part of it, except her Repentance to our Imitation: On the contrary, she makes frequent Excursions, in a just censuring and condemning her own Practice: How often does she approach herself in the most passionate Manner; and guide us to just Re∣flections in the like Cases?</P>
<P>It is true, She met with unexpected Success in all her wicked Courses; but even in the high∣est Elevations of her Prosperity, she makes fre∣quent Acknowledgments, that the Pleasure of her Wickedness was not worth the Repentance; and that all the Satisfaction she had, all the Joy in the View of her Prosperity, no, nor all the Wealth she rowl'd in; the Gayety of her Ap∣pearance; the Equipages, and the Honours, she was attended with, cou'd quiet her Mind, a∣bate the Reproaches of her Conscience, or pro∣cure her an Hour's Sleep, when just Reflections kept her waking.</P>
<P>The noble Inferences that are drawn from this one Part, are worth all the rest of the Story, and abundantly justify (as they are the profess'd Design of) the Publication.</P>
<P>If there are any Parts in her Story, which being oblig'd to relate a wicked Action, seem to describe it too plainly, <HI>the Writer says,</HI> all imaginable Care has been taken to keep clear of Indecencies, and immodest Expressions; and 'tis hop'd you will find nothing to prompt a vicious<HI><PB REF="6"/></HI>Mind, but every-where much to discourage and expose it.</P>
<P>Scenes of Crime can scarce be represented in such a Manner, but some may make a criminal Use of them; but when Vice is painted in its Low-priz'd Colours, 'tis not to make People in love with it, but to expose it; and if the Reader makes a wrong Use of the Figures, the Wicked∣ness is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Advantages of the present Work are so great, and the virtuous Rea∣der has room for so much Improvement, that we make no Question, the Story, however meanly told, will find a Passage to his best Hours; and be read both with Profit and Delight.</P>

<PB REF="7"/>
<HEAD><HI>ROXANA:</HI> OR, THE FORTUNATE MISTRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I Was born, as my Friends told me, at the City of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> in the Province, or County of <HI>Poictou,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> from whence I was brought to <HI>England</HI> by my Parents, who fled for their Religion about the Year 1683, when the Protes∣tants were banished from <HI>France</HI> by the Cruelty of their Persecutors.</P>
<P>I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was well enough pleased with being here; <HI>London,</HI> a large and gay City, took with me mighty well, who, from my being a Child, loved a Crowd, and to see a great-many fine Folks.</P>
<P>I retained nothing of <HI>France,</HI> but the Language: My Father and Mother being People of better Fashion, than ordinarily the People called Refugees at that Time were; and having fled early, while it was easy to se∣ure their Effects, had, before their coming over, re∣mitted
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
considerable Sums of Money, or, as I remem∣ber, a considerable Value in <HI>French</HI> Brandy, Paper, and other Goods; and these selling very much to Advan∣tage here, my Father was in very good Circumstances at his coming over, so that he was far from applying to the rest of our Nation that were here, for Counte∣nance and Relief: On the contrary, he had his Door continually throng'd with miserable Objects of the Poor starving Creatures, who at that Time fled hither for Shelter on Account of Conscience, or something else.</P>
<P>I have indeed, heard my Father say, That he was pester'd with a great many of those, who, for any Re∣ligion they had, might even have stay'd where they were, but who flock'd over hither in Droves, for what they call in <HI>English,</HI> a Lively hood; hearing with what open Arms the Refugees were received in <HI>England,</HI> and how they sell readily into Business, being by the chari∣table Assistance of the People of <HI>London,</HI> encouraged to Work in their Manufactures, in <HI>Spittle-fields, Canter∣bury,</HI> and other Places; and that they had a much bet∣ter Price for their Work, than in <HI>France,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>My Father, I say, told me, That he was more pes∣ter'd with the Clamours of these People, than of those who were truly Refugees, and fled in Distress, meerly for Conscience.</P>
<P>I was about ten Years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I have said, my Father liv'd in very good Circumstances, and died in about eleven Years more; in which Time, as I had accomplish'd myself for the sociable Part of the World, so I had acquainted myself with some of our <HI>English</HI> Neighbours, as is the Custom in <HI>London;</HI> and as, while I was young, I had pick'd up three or four Play-fellows and Companions, suitable to my Years; so as we grew bigger, we learnt to call one another Intimates and Friends; and this for∣warded very much the finishing me for Conversation, and the World.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>English</HI> Schools, and being young, I learnt the <HI>English</HI> Tongue perfectly well, with all the Custom of the <HI>English</HI> young Women; so that I retained no∣thing
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
of the <HI>French,</HI> but the Speech; nor did I so much as keep any Remains of the <HI>French</HI> Language tagg'd to my Way of Speaking, as most Foreigners do, but spoke what we call Natural <HI>English,</HI> as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own Character, I must be excus'd to give it as impartially as possible, and as if I was speaking of another Person; and the Sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter my self or no.</P>
<P>I was (speaking of myself as about fourteen Years of Age) tall, and very well made; sharp as a Hawk in Matters of common Knowledge; quick and smart in Discourse; apt to be satyrical; full of Repartee, and a little too forward in Conversation; or, as we call it in <HI>English,</HI> Bold, though perfectly Modest in my Behavi∣our. Being <HI>French</HI> born, I danced, as some say, natu∣rally, loved it extreamly, and sung well also, and so well, that, as you will hear, it was afterwards some Advantage to me: With all these Things, I wanted neither Wit, Beauty, or Money. In this Manner I set out into the World, having all the Advantages that any young Woman cou'd desire, to recommend me to others, and form a Prospect of happy Living to myself.</P>
<P>At about fifteen Years of Age, my Father gave me as he called it in <HI>French,</HI> 25000 Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, that is to say, two thousand Pounds Portion, and married me to an eminent Brewer in the City; <HI>Pardon me if I conceal his Name, for though he was the Foundation of my Ruin, I cannot take so severe a Revenge upon him.</HI></P>
<P>With this Thing called a Husband, I lived eight Years in good Fashion, and for some Part of the Time, kept a Coach, that is to say, a Kind of mock Coach; for all the Week the Horses were kept at Work in the Dray-carts, but on Sunday I had the Privilege to go abroad in my Chariot, either to Church, or other∣ways, as my Husband and I could agree about it; which, by the way, was not very often: But of that hereafter.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the History of the marry'd Part
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
of my Life, you must allow me to give as impartial an Account of my Husband, as I have done of my self: He was a jolly, handsome Fellow, as any Woman need wish for a Companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not so as to be ungenteel; he dan∣ced well, which, I think, was the first Thing that brought us together: He had an old Father, who ma∣naged the Business carefully, so that he had little of that Part lay on him, but now and then to appear, and show himself; and he took the Advantage of it, for he troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.</P>
<P>After I have told you that he was a handsome Man, and a good Sportsman, I have, indeed, said all; and unhappy was I, like other young People of our Sex, I chose him for being a handsome, jolly Fellow, as I have said; for he was otherwise a weak, empty-head∣ed, untaught Creature, as any Woman could ever de∣sire to be coupled with: And here I must take the Li∣berty, whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after Conduct, to turn to my Fellow-Creatures, the young Ladies of this Country, and speak to them, by Way of Precaution, If you have any Regard to your future Happiness; any View of living comfortably with a Husband; any Hope of preserving your Fortunes, or restoring them after any Disaster; Never, Ladies, mar∣ry a Fool; any Husband rather than a Fool; with some other Husbands you may be unhappy, but with a Fool you will be miserable; with another Husband you <HI>may,</HI> I say, be unhappy, but with a Fool you <HI>must;</HI> nay, if he would, he cannot make you easy; every Thing he does is so awkard, every Thing he says is so empty, a Woman of any Sense cannot but be surfeited, and sick of him twenty Times a Day: What is more shocking, than for a Woman to bring a handsome, comely Fellow of a Husband, into Company, and then be obliged to blush for him every Time she hears him speak? To hear other Gentlemen talk Sense, and he able to say nothing? And so look like a Fool, or,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
which is worse, hear him talk Nonsense, and laugh'd at for a Fool.</P>
<P>In the next Place, there are so many Sorts of Fools, such an infinite Variety of Fools, and so hard it is to know the worst of the Kind, that I am obliged to say, no Fool, Ladies, at all, no kind of Fool, whether a mad Fool, or a sober Fool, a wise Fool, or a silly Fool; take any Thing but a Fool; nay, be any thing, be even an old Maid, the worst of Nature's Curses, ra∣ther than take up with a Fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a while, for I shall have Occasion to speak of it again; my Case was particularly hard, for I had a Variety of foolish Things complicated in this unhappy Match.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> and which, I confess, is very unsufferable, he was a conceited Fool. <HI>Tout Opiniatre,</HI> every Thing he said, was right, was best, and was to the Purpose, whoever was in Company, and whatever was advanced by others, though with the greatest Modesty imagina∣ble; and yet when he came to defend what he had said, by Argument and Reason, he would do it so weakly, so emptily, and so nothing to the Purpose, that it was enough to make any Body that heard him, sick and ashamed of him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> he was positive and obstinate, and the most positive in the most simple and incons9stent Things, such as were intollerable to bear.</P>
<P>These two Articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a most unbearable Creature for a Husband; and so it may be supposed at first Sight, what a kind of Life I led with him: However, I did as well as I could, and held my Tongue, which was the only Victory I gained over him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling Way with me, and I would not answer, or enter into Discourse with him on the Point he was upon, he would rise up in the greatest Passion imaginable, and go away; which was the cheapest Way I had to be delivered.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here much, upon the Method I took to make my Life passable and easy with the most in∣corrigible
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
Temper in the World; but it is too long, and the Articles too trifling: I shall mention some of them as the Circumstances I am to relate, shall necessa∣rily bring them in.</P>
<P>After I had been married about four Years, my own Father died, my Mother having been dead before. He liked my Match so ill, and saw so little Room to to be satisfy'd with the Conduct of my Husband, that though he left me 5000 Livres, and more at his Death, yet he left it in the Hands of my Elder Brother, who running on too rashly in his Adventures, as a Mer∣chant, failed, and lost not only what he had, but what he had for me too; as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>Thus I lost the last Gift of my Father's Bounty by having a Husband not fit to be trusted with it; there's one of the Benefits of marrying a Fool.</P>
<P>Within two Years after my own Father's Death, my Husband's Father also died, and, as I thought, left him a considerable Addition to his Estate, the whole Trade of the Brewhouse, which was a very good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this Addition to his Stock was his Ruin, for he had no Genius to Business; he had no Knowledge of his Accounts; he bustled a little about it indeed, at first, and put on a Face of Business, but he soon grew slack; it was below him to inspect his Books, he com∣mitted all that to his Clerks and Book keepers; and while he sound Money in Cash to pay the Malt-man, and the Excise, and put some in his Pocket, he was perfectly easy and indolent, let the main Chance go how it would.</P>
<P>I foresaw the Consequence of this, and attempted se∣veral Times to perswade him to apply himself to his Business; I put him in Mind how his Customers com∣plained of the Neglect of his Servants on one Hand, and how abundance broke in his Debt, on the other Hand, for want of the Clerk's Care to secure him, and the like; but he thrust me by; either with hard Words, or fraudulently, with representing the Cases otherwise than they were.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
However, to cut short a dull Story, which ought not to be long, he began to find his Trade sunk, his Stock declined, and that, in short, he could not carry on his Business, and once or twice his Brewing Uten∣sils were extended for the Excise; and the last Time he was put to great Extremities to clear them.</P>
<P>This alarm'd him, and he resolved to lay down his Trade; which, indeed, I was not sorry for; foresee∣ing that if he did not lay it down in Time, he would be forced to do it another Way, namely, as a Bankrupt. Also I was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I should come to be stript at Home, and be turned out of Doors with my Children; for I had now five Children by him; the only Work (per∣haps) that Fools are good for.</P>
<P>I thought myself happy when he got another Man to take his Brew house clear off his Hands; for pay∣ing down a large Sum of Money, my Husband found himself a clear Man, all his Debts paid, and with be∣tween two and three thousand Pounds in his Pocket; and being now obliged to remove from the Brewhouse, we took a House at—, a Village about two Miles out of Town; and happy I thought myself, all Things considered, that I was got off clear, upon so good Terms; and had my handsome Fellow had but one Cap full of Wit, I had been still well enough.</P>
<P>I proposed to him either to buy some Place with the Money, or with Part of it, and offer'd to join my Part to it, which was then in Being, and might have been secured; so we might have lived tollerably, at least, during his Life. But as it is the Part of a Fool to be void of Counsel, so he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his Horses and Men, rid every Day out to the Forest a Hunting, and nothing was done all this while; but the Money decreased apace, and I thought I saw my Ruin hastening on, without any possible Way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that Perswasions and Entreaties could perform, but it was all fruitless; re∣presenting to him how fast our Money wasted, and
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
what would be our Condition when it was gone, made no Impression on him; but like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all that Tears and Lamentations could be suppos'd to do; nor did he abate his Figure or E∣quipage, his Horses or Servants, even to the last; till he had not a hundred Pounds left in the whole World.</P>
<P>It was not above three Years that all the Ready-Money was thus spending off; yet he spent it as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no valuable Com∣pany neither; but generally with Huntsmen and Horse-Coursers, and Men meaner than himself, which is another Consequence of a Man's being a Fool; such can never take Delight in Men more wise and capable than themselves; and that makes them converse with Scoundrels, drink Belch with Porters, and keep Com∣pany always below themselves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched Condition, when one Morn∣ing my Husband told me, he was sensible he was come to a miserable Condition, and he would go and seek his Fortune somewhere or other; he had said some∣thing to that Purpose several Times before that, upon my pressing him to consider his Circumstances, and the Circumstances of his Family, before it should be too late: But as I found he had no Meaning in any Thing of that Kind, as indeed, he had not much in any Thing he ever said; so I thought they were but Words of Course now: When he said he wou'd be gone, I us'd to wish secretly, and even say in my Thoughts, <HI>I wish you wou'd, for if you go on thus, you will starve us all.</HI></P>
<P>He staid, however, at Home all that Day, and lay at home that Night; early the next Morning he gets out of Bed, goes to a Window which look'd out to∣wards the Stables, and sounds his <HI>French</HI> Horn, as he call'd it; which was his usual Signal to call his Men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was about the latter-End of <HI>August,</HI> and so was light yet at five a-Clock, and it was about that Time that I heard him and his two Men go out and shut the
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
Yard-Gates after them. He said nothing to me more than as usual when he us'd to go out upon his Sport; neither did I rise, or say any Thing to him that was material, but went to-sleep again after he was gone, for two Hours, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>It must be a little surprizing to the Reader to tell him at once, that after this, I never saw my Husband more; but to go farther, I not only never saw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of any or either of his two Servants, or of the Horses, either what became of them, where, or which Way they went, or what they did, or intended to do, no more than if the Ground had open'd and swallow'd them all up, and no-body had known it; except as hereafter.</P>
<P>I was not, for the first Night or two, at all sur∣priz'd, no nor very much the first Week or two, be∣lieving that if any Thing Evil had befallen them, I should soon enough have heard of that; and also know∣ing that he had two Servants and three Horses with him, it would be the strangest Thing in the World that any Thing could befal them all, but that I must some Time or other hear of them.</P>
<P>But you will easily allow, that as Time run on a Week, two Weeks, a Month, two Months, and so on I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the more when I look'd into my own Circumstances, and consider'd the Condition in which I was left; with five Children, and not one farthing Subsistance for them, other than about seventy Pounds in Money, and what few Things of Value I had about me, which, tho' considerable in themselves, were yet nothing to feed a Family, and for a Length of Time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have Re∣course; to keep in the House where I was, I could not, the Rent being too great; and to leave it without his Order, if my Husband should return, I could not think of that neither; so that I continued extremely perplex'd, melancholly, and discourag'd, to the last Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
I remain'd in this dejected Condition near a Twelve-month. My Husband had two Sisters, who were married, and liv'd very well, and some other near Re∣lations that I knew of, and I hop'd would do some∣thing for me; and I frequently sent to these, to know if they could give me any Account of my vagrant Creature; but they all declar'd to me in answer, that they knew nothing about him; and after frequent send∣ing, began to think me troublesome, and to let me know they thought so too, by their treating my Maid with very slight and unhandsome Returns to her En∣quiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my Affliction, but I had no Recourse but to my Tears, for I had not a Friend of my own left me in the World: I should have observ'd, that it was about half a Year before this Elope∣ment of my Husband, that the Disaster I mention'd above befel my Brother; who broke, and that in such bad Circumstances, that I had the Mortification to hear not only that he was in Prison, but that there would be little or nothing to be had by Way of Composition.</P>
<P>Misfortunes seldom come alone: This was the Fore-runner of my Husband's Flight; and as my Expec∣tations were cut off on that Side, my Husband gone, and my Family of Children on my Hands, and no∣thing to subsist them, my Condition was the most deplorable that Words can express.</P>
<P>I had some Plate and some Jewels, as might be supposed, my Fortune and former Circumstances con∣sider'd; and my Husband, who had never staid to be distress'd, had not been put to the Necessity of rifling me, as Husbands usually do in such Cases: But as I had seen an End of all the Ready Money, during the long Time I had liv'd in a State of Expectation for my Husband, so I began to make away one Thing after another, till those few Things of Value which I had, began to lessen apace, and I saw nothing but Misery and the utmost Distress before me, even to have my Children starve before my Face. I leave any one that is a Mother of Children, and has liv'd in
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
Plenty and good Fashion, to consider and reflect, what must be my Condition; As to my Husband, I had now no Hope or Expectation of seeing him any more; and, indeed, if I had, he was the Man, of all the Men in the World, the least able to help me, or to have turn'd his Hand to the gaining one Shilling to∣wards lessening our Distress; he neither had the Ca∣pacity or the Inclination; he could have been no Clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible Hand; he was so far from being able to write Sense, that he could not make Sense of what others wrote; he was so far from understanding good <HI>English,</HI> that he could not spell good <HI>English:</HI> To be out of all Business was his Delight; and he would stand leaning against a Post for half an Hour together, with a Pipe in his Mouth, with all the Tranquillity in the World, smoaking, <HI>like</HI> Dryden's <HI>Countryman that whistled as he went for Want of Thought,</HI> and this even when his Family was, as it were starving, that little he had wasting, and that we were all bleeding to Death; he not knowing, and as little considering, where to get another Shilling when the last was spent.</P>
<P>This being his Temper, and the Extent of his Ca∣pacity, I confess I did not see so much Loss in his parting with me, as at first I thought I did; tho' it was hard and cruel, to the last Degree in him, not giving me the least Notice of his Design; and, indeed, that which I was most astonish'd at, wa, that seeing he must certainly have intended this Excursion some few Moments at least, before he put it in Practice, yet he did not come and take what little Stock of Mo∣ney we had left; or at least, a Share of it, to bear his Expence for a little while, but he did not; and I am morally certain he had not five Guineas with him in the World, when he went away: All that I cou'd come to the Knowledge of, about him was, that he left his Hunting-Horn, which he call'd the <HI>French</HI> Horn, in the Stable, and his Hunting Saddle, went away in a handsome Furniture, as they call it, which he used sometimes to travel with; having an
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
embroidered Housing a Case of Pistols, and other Things belonging to them; and one of his Servants had another Saddle with Pistols, though plain; and the other a long Gun; so that they did not go out as Sportsmen, but rather as Travellers: What Part of the World they went to, I never heard for many Years.</P>
<P>As I have said, I sent to his Relations, but they sent me short and surly Answers; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me, or to see the Children, or so much as to enquire after them, well perceiving that I was in a Condition that was likely to be soon troublesome to them: But it was no Time now to dally with them, or with the World; I left off sending to them, and went myself among them; laid my Cir∣cumstances open to them, told them my whole Case, and the Condition I was reduc'd to, begg'd they would advise me what Course to take, laid myself as low as they could desire, and intreated them to consider that I was not in a Condition to help myself, and that without some Assistance, we must all inevitably perish: I told them, that if I had had but one Child or two Children, I would have done my Endeavour to have work'd for them with my Needle, and should only have come to them to beg them to help me to some Work, that I might get our Bread by my Labour; but to think of one single Woman not bred to work, and at a Loss where to get Employment, to get the Bread of five Children, that was not possible, some of my Children being young too, and none of them big enough to help one another.</P>
<P>It was all one, I receiv'd not one Farthing of As∣sistance from any Body, was hardly ask'd to sit down at the two Sisters Houses, nor offer'd to eat or drink at two more near Relations. The Fifth, an ancient Gentlewoman, Aunt-in-Law to my Husband, a Widow, and the least able also of any of the rest, did, indeed, ask me to sit down, gave me a Dinner, and refresh'd me with a kinder Treatment than any of the rest; but added the melancholly Part, <HI>viz.</HI> That she would have
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
help'd me, but that, indeed, she was not able; which, however, I was satisfied was very true.</P>
<P>Here I reliev'd myself with the constant Assistant of the Afflicted, I mean Tears; for, relating to her how I was received by the other of my Husband's Relations, it made me built into Tears, and I cry'd vehemently for a great while together, till I made the good old Gentlewoman cry too several Times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all without any Relief, and went on at Home till I was reduc'd to such inexpressible Distress, that it is not to be desscrib'd: I had been several Times after this at the old Aunt's; for I prevail'd with her to promise me to go and talk with the other Relations; at least, that, if possible, she could bring some of them to take off the Children, or to contribute something towards their Maintenance; and, to do her Justice, she did use her Endeavour with them, but all was to no Purpose, they would do no∣thing, at least that Way: I think, with much Entreaty, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he obtain'd by a kind of Collection among them all, about eleven or twelve Shillings in Money; which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' it was a Present Comfort, was yet not to be nam'd as capable to deliver me from any Part of the Load that lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor Woman that had been a kind of a Dependant upon our Family, and who I had often, a∣mong the rest of the Relations, been very kind to; my Maid put it into my Head one Morning to send to his poor Woman and to see whether she might not be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to help, in this dreadful Case.</P>
<P>I must remember it here, to the Praise of this poor Girl my Maid, that tho' I was not able to give her any Wages, and had told her so, nay I was not able <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet he would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any Money, when I had none, she would help me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of her own; for which, tho' I acknowledg'd her Kindness and Fidelity, yet it was but a bad Coin that he was paid in at last, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>AMY,</HI> (for that was her Name) put it into my Thoughts to send for this poor Woman to come to me,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
for I was now in great Distress, and I resolv'd to do so; but just the very Morning that I intended it, the old Aunt, with the poor Woman in her Company, came to see me; the good old Gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concern'd for me, and had been talking again among those People, to see what she could do for me; but to very little Purpose.</P>
<P>You shall judge a little of my present Distress by the Posture she found me in: I had five little Children, the eldest was under ten Years old, and I had not one Shilling in the House to buy them Victuals, but had sent <HI>Amy</HI> out with a Silver Spoon, to sell it, and bring home something from the Butcher's; and I was in a Parlour, sitting on the Ground, with a great Heap of old Rags, Linnen, and other Things about me, look∣ing them over, to see if I had any Thing among them that would Sell or Pawn for a little Money, and had been crying ready to burst myself, to think what I should do next.</P>
<P>At this Juncture they knock'd at the Door, I thought it had been <HI>Amy,</HI> so I did not rise up, but one of the Children open'd the Door, and they came directly into the Room where I was, and where they found me in that Posture, and crying vehemently, as above; I was surpriz'd at their coming, you may be sure, espe∣cially seeing the Person I had but just before resolv'd to send for: But when they saw me; how I look'd, for my Eyes were swell'd with crying, and what a Condition I was in as to the House, and the Heaps of Things that were about me, and especially when I told them what I was doing, and on what Occasion, they sat down like <HI>Job</HI>'s three Comforters, and said not one Word to me for a great while, but both of them cry'd as fast, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The Truth was, there was no need of much Dis∣course in the Case, the Thing spoke itself; they saw me in Rags and Dirt; who was but a little before riding in my Coach; thin, and looking almost like one starv'd, who was before fat and beautiful: The House that was before handsomely furnish'd with Pictures and Ornaments, Cabinets, Peir-Glasses, and every thing suitable, was
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
now stripp'd, and naked, most of the Goods having been seiz'd by the Landlord for Rent, or sold to buy Necessaries; in a Word, all was Misery and Distress, the Face of Ruin was every where to be seen; we had eaten up almost every Thing, and little remain'd, unless, like one of the pitiful Women of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> I should eat up my very Children themselves.</P>
<P>After these two good Creatures had sat, as I say, in Silence some Time, and had then look'd about them, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> came in, and brought with her a small Breast of Mutton, and two great Bunches of Turnips, which she intended to stew for our Dinner; As for me, my Heart was so overwhelm'd at seeing these two Friends, for such they were, tho' poor, and at their seeing me in such a Condition, that I fell into another violent Fit of Crying; so that in short, I could not speak to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in such an Agony, they went to my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> at another Part of the same Room, and talk'd with her: <HI>Amy</HI> told them all my Circumstances, and set them forth in such moving Terms, and so to the Life, that I could not upon any Terms have done it like her myself, and in a Word, affected them both with it in such a Manner, that the old Aunt came to me, and tho' hardly able to speak for Tears: Look ye, Cousin, said she, in a few Words, Things must not stand thus; some Course must be taken, and that forth∣with; pray where were these Children born? I told her the Parish where we liv'd before, that four of them were born there; and one in the House where I now was, where the Landlord, after having seiz'd my Goods for the Rent past, not then knowing my Circumstan∣ces, had now given me leave to live for a whole Year more without any Rent, being moved with Compassion; but that this Year was now almost expir'd.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this Account, they came to this Re∣solution: That the Children should be all carried by them to the Door of one of the Relations mention'd above, and be set down there by the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I, the Mother, should remove for some Days, shut up the Doors, and be gone; that the People should be
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
told, That if they did not think sit to take some Care of the Children, they might send for the Church-War∣dens if they thought that better; for that they were born in that Parish, and there they must be provided for; as for the other Child which was born in the Parish of—, that was already taken care of by the Parish-Officers there; for, indeed, they were so sensible of the Distress of the Family, that they had at first Word, done what was their Part to do.</P>
<P>This was what these good Women propos'd, and bade me leave the rest to them. I was at first, sadly afflicted at the Thoughts of parting with my Children, and especially at that terrible Thing, their being taken into the Parish-keeping; and then a hundred terrible Things came into my Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> of Parish-Chil∣dren being starv'd at Nurse: of their being ruin'd, let grow crooked, lam'd, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this sunk my very Heart within me.</P>
<P>But the Misery of my own Circumstances hardened my Heart against my own Flesh and Blood; and when I consider'd they must inevitably be starv'd, and I too, if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconcil'd to parting with them all, any how, and any where, that I might be freed from the dreadful Ne∣cessity of seeing them all perish, and perishing with them myself: So I agreed to go away out of the House, and leave the Management of the whole Matter to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and to them, and accordingly I did so; and the same Afternoon they carred them all away to one of their <HI>Aunts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> a resolute Girl, knock'd at the Door, with the Children all with her, and bade the Eldest, as soon as the Door was open run in, and the rest after her: She set them all down at the Door before she knock'd, and when she knock'd, she staid till a Maid Servant came to the Door; Sweetheart, said she, pray go in and tell your Mistress, here are her little Cousins come to see her from—, naming the Town where we liv'd, at which the Maid offer'd to go back: Here Child, says <HI>Amy,</HI> take one of them in your Hand, and
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
I'll bring the rest; so she gives her the least, and the Wench goes in mighty innocently, with the little one in her Hand, upon which <HI>Amy</HI> turns the rest in after her, shuts the Door softly, and marches off as fast as she cou'd.</P>
<P>Just in the Interval of this, and even while the Maid and her Mistress' were quarrelling, for the Mistress rav'd and scolded at her like a Mad-woman, and had order'd her to go and stop the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and turn all the Chil∣dren out of the Doors again; but she had been at the Door, and <HI>Amy</HI> was gone, and the Wench was out of her Wits, and the Mistress too: I say, just at this Juncture came the poor old Woman, not the Aunt, but the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the Door; the Aunt did not go, because she had pretended to advocate for me, and they would have suspected her of some Contrivance; but as for the other Woman, they did not so much as know that she had kept up any Correspondence with me.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and she had concerted this between them, and it was well enough contriv'd that they did so. When she came into the House, the Mistress was suming and rag∣ing like one distracted, and calling the Maid all the foolish Jades and Sluts that she could think of, and that she would take the Children and turn them all out into the Streets. The good poor Woman seeing her in such a Passion, turn'd about as if she would be gone a∣gain, and said, Madam, I'll come again another Time, I see you are engag'd. No, no, Mrs—, says the Mistress, I am not much engag'd, sit down: This sense∣less Creature here has brought in my Fool of a Bro∣ther's whole House of Children upon me, and tells me, that a Wench brought them to the Door, and thru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them in, and bade her carry them to me; but it shall be no Disturbance to me, for I have order'd them to be set in the Street, without the Door, and so let the Church-Wardens take care of them, or else make this dull Jade carry 'em back to—again, and let her that brought them into the World, look after them if she will; what does she send her Brats to me for?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24"/>
The last, indeed, had been the best of the two, says the poor Woman, if it had been to be done, and that brings me to tell you my Errand, and the Occasion of my coming, for I came on purpose about this very Bu∣siness, and to have prevented this being put upon you, if I cou'd; but I see I am come too late.</P>
<P>How do you mean too late, says the Mistress? What have you been concern'd in this Affair then? What, have you help'd to bring this Family-Slur upon us? I hope you do not think such a Thing of me, Madam, says the poor Woman; but I went this Morning to—, to see my old Mistress and Benefactor, for she had been very kind to me, and when I came to the Door, I found all fast lock'd and bolted, and the House look∣ing as if nobody was at Home.</P>
<P>I knock'd at the Door, but no-body came, till at last some of the Neighbours Servants call'd to me, and said, There's no-body lives there, Mistress, what do you knock for? I seem'd surpriz'd at that: What, no-body live there! <HI>said I,</HI> what d'ye mean! Does not Mrs.—live there? The Answer was, No, she is gone; at which I parly'd with one of them, and ask'd her what was the Matter. Matter, says she, why 'tis Matter enough, the poor Gentlewoman has liv'd there all alone, and without any Thing to subsist her a long Time, and this Morning the Landlord turn'd her out of Doors.</P>
<P>Out of Doors! <HI>says I,</HI> what with all her Children, poor Lambs, what is become of them? Why truly, nothing worse, <HI>said they,</HI> can come to them than stay∣ing here, for they were almost starv'd with Hunger; so the Neighbours seeing the poor Lady in such Distress, for she stood crying, and wringing her Hands over her Children like one distracted, sent for the Church-War∣dens to take care of the Children; and they, when they came, took the youngest, which was born in this Parish, and have got it a very good Nurse, and tak∣en Care of it; but as for the other four, they had sent them away to some of their Father's Relations, who were very substantial People, and who besides that, liv'd in the Parish where they were born.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25"/>
I was not so surpriz'd at this, as not presently to foresee that this Trouble would be brought upon you, or upon Mr.—; so I came immediately to bring you Word of it, that you might be prepar'd for it, and might not be surpriz'd, but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that I know not what to advise; the poor Wo∣man, it seems, is turn'd out of Doors into the Street; and another of the Neighbours there told me, that when they took her Children from her, she swoon'd away, and when they recover'd her out of that, she run distracted, and is put into a Mad-House by the Parish; for there is no-body else to take any Care of her.</P>
<P>This was all acted to the Life by this good, kind, poor Creature; for tho' her Design was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not one Word of it true in Fact: For I was not turn'd out of Doors by the Landlord, nor gone distracted; it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor Children, I fainted, and was like one Mad when I came to myself and found they were gone; but I remain'd in the House a good while after that; as you shall hear.</P>
<P>While the poor Woman was telling this dismal Story, in came the Gentlewoman's Husband, and tho' her Heart was harden'd against all Pity, who was really and nearly related to the Children, for they were the Children of her own Brother; yet the good Man was quite soften'd with the dismal Relation of the Circum∣stances of the Family; and when the poor Woman had done, he said to his Wife, this is a dismal Case, my Dear, indeed, and something must be done: His Wife fell a raving at him, What, <HI>says she,</HI> do you want to have four Children to keep? Have we not Children of our own? Would you have these Brats come and eat up my Children's Bread? No, no, let 'em go to the Parish, and let them take Care of them, I'll take Care of my own.</P>
<P>Come, come, my Dear, <HI>says the Husband,</HI> Charity is a Duty to the Poor, and <HI>he that gives to the Poor, lends to the Lord;</HI> let us lend our heavenly Father a little of our Children's Bread, as you call it, it will be a Store well laid up for them, and will be the best Security that
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
our Children shall never come to want Charity, or be turn'd out of Doors, as these poor innocent Creatures are. Don't tell me of Security, <HI>says the Wife;</HI> 'tis a good Security for our Children, to keep what we have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis Time e∣nough to help to keep other Folks Children; Charity begins at home.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says he again,</HI> I only talk of put∣iin out a little Money to Interest, our Maker is a good Borrower, never fear making a bad Debt there Child; I'll be bound for it.</P>
<P>Don't banter me with your Charity and your Allego∣ries, <HI>says the Wife angrily,</HI> I tell you they are my Re∣lations, not yours, and they shall not roost here, they shall go to the Parish.</P>
<P>All your Relations are my Relations now, <HI>says the good Gentleman very calmly,</HI> and I won't see your Rela∣tions in Distress and not pity them, any mere than I would my own; indeed, my Dear, they shan't go to the Parish, I assure you none of my Wife's Relations shall come to the Parish, if I can help it.</P>
<P>What, will you take four Children to keep? <HI>says the Wife.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> there's your Sister—, I'll go and talk with her, and your Uncle—I'll send for him and the rest; I'll warrant you when we are all together we will find Ways and Means to keep four poor little Creatures from Beggary and Starving, or else it would be very hard; we are none of us in so bad Cir∣cumstances, but we are able to spare a Mite for the Father∣less; don't shut up your Bowels of Compassion against your own Flesh and Blood: Could you hear these poor innocent Children cry at your Door for Hunger, and give them no Bread?</P>
<P>Prithee what need they cry at our Door? <HI>says she,</HI> 'tis the Business of the Parish to provide for them, they shan't cry at our Door; if they do, I'll give them nothing: Wont you, <HI>says he,</HI> but I will; remember that dreadful Scripture is directly against us, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxi. 13. <HI>Whose stoppeth his Ears at the Cry of the Poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="27"/>
Well, well, <HI>says she,</HI> you must do what you will, be∣cause you pretend to be Master; but if I had my Will, I would send them where they ought to to be sen, I would send them from whence they came.</P>
<P>Then the poor Woman put in, and said, But, Ma∣dam, that is sending them to starve indeed; for the Parish has no Obligation to take Care of them, and so they would lie and perish in the Street.</P>
<P>Or be sent back again, says the Husband, to our Parish in a Cripple-cart, by the Justice's Warrant, and so expose us and all the Relations to the last Degree, among our Neighbours, and among those who knew the good old Gentleman their Grandfather, who liv'd and flourished in this Parish so many Years, and was so well belov'd among all People, and deserved it so well.</P>
<P>I don't value that one Farthing, not I, says the Wife, I'll keep none of them.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, says her Husband, but I value it, for I won't have such a Blot lie upon the Family, and upon your Children; he was a worthy, ancient, and good Man, and his Name is respected among all his Neighbours; it will be a Reproach to you, that are his Daughter, and to our Children, that are his Grand-Children, that we should let your Brother's Children perish, or come to be a Charge to the Publick, in the very Place where your Family once flourished: Come, say no more, I will see what can be done.</P>
<P>Upon this, he sends and gathers all the Relations to∣gether at a Tavern hard by, and sent for the four little Children that they might see them; and they all, at first Word, agreed to have them taken Care of; and because his Wife was so furious that she would not suf∣fer one of them to be kept at Home, they agreed to keep them all together for a while; so they committed them to the poor Woman that had managed the Affair for them, and enter'd into Obligations to one another to supply the needful Sums for their Maintenance; and not to have one separated from the rest, they sent for the youngest from the Parish where it was taken in, and had them all brought up together.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>
I would take up too long a Part of this Story to give a particular Account with what a charitable Tenderness this good Person, who was but an Uncle in law to them, managed that Affair; how careful he was of them; went constantly to see them, and to see that they were well provided for, cloathed, put to School, and at last put out in the World for their Advantage; but 'tis enough to say he acted more like a Father to them, than an Uncle-in-law, though all along much against his Wives Consent, who was of a Disposition not so tender and compassionate as her Husband</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the same Pleasure which I now feel at the relating it again; for I was terribly frighted at the Apprehensions of my Children being brought to Misery and Distress, as those must be who have no Friends, but are left to Parish Benevolence.</P>
<P>I was now, however, entring on a new Scene of Life; I had a great House upon my Hands, and some Furniture left in it, but I was no more able to main∣tain myself and my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> in it, than I was my five Children; nor had I any Thing to subsist with, but what I might get by working, and that was not a Town where much Work was to be had.</P>
<P>My Landlord had been very kind indeed, after he came to know my Circumstances, though before I was acquainted with that Part, he had gone so far as to seize my Goods, and to carry some of them off too.</P>
<P>But I had liv'd three Quarters of a Year in his House after that, and had paid him no Rent, and which was worse, I was in no Condition to pay him any; how∣ever, I observed he came oftner to see me, look'd kind∣er upon me, and spoke more friendly to me, than he us'd to do; particularly the last two or three Times he had been there, he observed, he said, how poorly I lived, how low I was reduced, and the like; told me it grieved him for my sake; and the last Time of all he was kinder still, told me he came to dine with me, and that I should give him leave to treat me; so he called my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and sent her out to buy a Joint of Meat; he told her what she should buy; but naming two or three Things, either of which she might take,
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
the Maid, a cunning Wench, and faithful to me, as the Skin to my Back, did not buy any Thing out right, but brought the Butcher along with her, with both the Things that she had chosen, for him to please himself; the one was a large very good Leg of Veal; the other a Piece of the Fore-ribs of Roasting beef; he look'd at them, but bade me cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer with the Butcher for him, and I did so, and came back to him, and told him what the Butcher demanded for either of them, and what each of them came to; so he pulls out 11 <HI>s.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> which they came to together, and bade me take them both; the rest, he said, would serve another Time.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd, you may be sure, at the Bounty of a Man that had but a little while ago been my Terror, and had torn the Goods out of my House, like a Fury; but I considered that my Distresses had mollified his Temper, and that he had afterwards been so compas∣sionate as to give me Leave to live Rent-free in the House a whole Year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the Face, not of a Man of Com∣passion only, but of a Man of Friendship and Kindness, and this was so unexpected, that it was surprizing: We chatted together, and were, as I may call it, chearful, which was more than I could say I had been for three Years before; he sent for Wine and Beer too, for I had none; poor <HI>Amy</HI> and I had drank nothing but Water for many Weeks, and indeed, I have often wonder'd at the faithful Temper of the poor Girl; for which I but ill requited her at last.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> was come with the Wine, he made her fill a Glass to him, and with the Glass in his Hand, he came to me and kiss'd me, which I was, I confess, a little surpriz'd at, but more at what followed; for he told me, That as the sad Condition which I was redu∣ced to, had made him pity me, so my Conduct in it, and the Courage I bore it with, had given him a more than ordinary Respect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my good; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve me, and to employ
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
his Thoughts in the mean Time, to see if he could, for the future, put me into a Way to support myself.</P>
<P>While he found me change Colour, and look sur∣priz'd at his Discourse, for so I did to be sure, he turns to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and looking at her, he says to me, I say all this, Madam, before your Maid, because both she and you shall know that I have no ill Design, and that I have, in meer Kindness, resolved to do some∣thing for you, if I can; and as I have been a Witness of the uncommon Honesty and Fidelity of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> here, to you in all your Distresses, I know she may be trusted with so honest a Design as mine is; for I assure you, I bear a proportion'd Regard to your Maid too, for her Affection to you.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> made him a Curt'sy, and the poor Girl look'd so confounded with Joy, that she could not speak, but her Colour came and went, and every now and then she blush'd as red as Scarlet, and the next Minute look'd as pale as Death: Well, having said this, he sate down, made me sit down, and then drank to me, and made me drink two Glasses of Wine together; for, says he, you have Need of it, and so indeed I had: When he had done so, Come <HI>Amy,</HI> says he, with your Mistresses's Leave, you shall have a Glass too, so he made her drink two Glasses also; and then rising up, And now, <HI>Amy,</HI> says he, go and get Dinner; and you, Madam, says he to me, go up and dress you, and come down and smile and be merry; adding, I'll make you easy, if I can; and in the mean Time, he said, he would walk in the Garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <HI>Amy</HI> changed her Countenance indeed, and looked as merry as ever she did in her Life; Dear Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> what does this Gentleman mean? Nay, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> he means to do us Good, you see, don't he? I know no other Meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me: I warrant you, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> he'll ask you a Favour by and by: No, no, you are mistaken, <HI>Amy,</HI> I dare say, <HI>said I,</HI> you heard what he said, didn't you? Ay, <HI>says</HI> Amy, it's no Matter for that, you shall see
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
what he will do after Dinner: Well, well, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> you have hard Thoughts of him, I cannot be of your Opinion; I don't see any Thing in him yet that looks like it: As to that, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I don't see any Thing of it yet neither; but what should move a Gen∣tleman to take Pity of us, as he does? Nay, <HI>says I,</HI> that's a hard Thing too, that we should judge a Man to be wicked because he's charitable; and vicious because he's kind; O Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, there's abundance of Charity begins in that Vice, and he is not so unac∣quainted with Things, as not to know, that Poverty is the strongest Incentive; a Temptation, against which no Virtue is powerful enough to stand out; he knows your Condition as well as you do: Well, and what then? Why then he knows too that you are young and hand∣some, and he has the surest Bait in the World to take you with.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> but he may find himself mistak∣en too in such a Thing as that: Why, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I hope you won't deny him, if he should of∣fer it.</P>
<P>What d'ye mean by that, <HI>Hussy, said I?</HI> No, I'd starve first.</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wiser; I'm sure if he will set you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will starve if you do not consent, that's certain.</P>
<P>What, consent to lye with him for Bread? <HI>Amy, said. I,</HI> how can you talk so?</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I don't think you wou'd for any Thing else; it would not be lawful for any thing else, but for Bread, Madam; why no body can starve, there's no bearing that, I'm sure.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>says I,</HI> but if he would give me an Estate to live on, he should not lye with me, I assure you.</P>
<P>Why look you, Madam, if he would but give you enough to live easy upon, he should lye with me for it with all my Heart.</P>
<P>That's a Token, <HI>Amy,</HI> of inimitable Kindness to me, <HI>said I,</HI> and I know how to value it; but there's more Friendship than Honesty in it, <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="32"/>
O Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I'd do any Thing to get you out of this sad Condition; as to Honesty, I think Ho∣nesty is out of the Question, when starving is the Case; are not we almost starved to Death?</P>
<P>I am indeed, <HI>said I,</HI> and thou art for my Sake; but to be a Whore, <HI>Amy!—</HI>and there I stopt.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, if I will starve for your Sake, I will be a Whore, or any Thing, for your Sake; why, I would die for you, if I were put to it.</P>
<P>Why that's an Excess of Affection, <HI>Amy,</HI> said I, I never met with before; I wish I may be ever in a Con∣dition to make you some Returns suitable: But how∣ever, <HI>Amy,</HI> you shall not be a Whore to him, to oblige him to be kind to me; no, <HI>Amy,</HI> nor I won't be a Whore to him, if he would give me much more than he is able to give me, or do for me.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I don't say I will go and ask him; but, I say, if he should promise to do so and so for you, and the Condition was such, that he would not serve you unless I would let him lye with me, he should lye with me as often as he would, rather than you should not have his Assistance; but this is but Talk, Ma∣dam, I don't see any need of such Discourse, and you are of Opinion that there will be no Need of it.</P>
<P>Indeed so I am, <HI>Amy;</HI> but, <HI>said I,</HI> if there was, I tell you again, I'd die before I would consent, or before you should consent for my Sake.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had not only preserv'd the Virtue itself, but the virtuous Inclination and Resolution; and had I kept myself there, I had been happy, tho' I had pe∣rish'd of meer Hunger; for, without Question, a Wo∣man ought rather to die than to prostitute her Virtue and Honour, let the Temptation be what it will.</P>
<P>But to return to my Story; he walk'd about the Gar∣den, which was, indeed, all in Disorder, and over-run with Weeds, because I had not been able to hire a Gar∣dener to do any Thing to it, no not so much as to dig up Ground enough to sow a few Turnips and Carrots for Family-use. After he had view'd it, he came in, and sent <HI>Amy</HI> to fetch a poor Man, a Gardener, that us'd to help our Man-servant, and carry'd him into the Gar∣den,
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
and ordered him to do several Things in it, to put it into a little Order; and this took him up near an Hour.</P>
<P>By this Time I had dress'd me as well as I could, for tho' I had good Linnen left still, yet I had but a poor Head-dress, and no Knots, but old Fragments; no Neck-lace, no Ear-rings; all those Things were gone long ago for meer Bread.</P>
<P>However, I was tight and clean, and in better Plight than he had seen me in a great while, and he look'd ex∣treamly pleas'd to see me so; for he said I look'd so dis∣consolate and so afflicted before, that it griev'd him to see me; and he bid me pluck up a good Heart, for he hop'd to be in a Condition to live in the World, and be beholden to nobody.</P>
<P>I told him that was impossible, for I must be behold∣en to him for it, for all the Friends I had in the World would not, nor could not do so much for me as that he spoke of. Well, Widow, <HI>says he,</HI> so he call'd me, and so indeed I was in the worse Sense that desolate Word could be us'd in, if you are beholden to me, you shall be beholden to nobody else.</P>
<P>By this Time Dinner was ready, and <HI>Amy</HI> came in to lay the Cloth, and indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I, for I had but six Plates left in the House, and but two Dishes; however, he knew how Things were, and bid me make no Scruple about bringing out what I had, he hop'd to see me in a better Plight; he did not come, <HI>he said,</HI> to be entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me: Thus he went on, speaking so chearfully to me, and such chearful Things, that it was a Cordial to my very Soul to hear him speak.</P>
<P>Well, we went to Dinner, I am sure I had not eat a good Meal hardly in a Twelvemonth, at least, not of such a Joint of Meat as the Loin of Veal was. I eat in∣deed very heartily, and so did he, and he made me drink three or four Glasses of Wine, so that, in short, my Spirits were lifted up to a Degree I had not been us'd to, and I was not only chearful, but merry, and so he press'd me to be.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34"/>
I told him, I had a great deal of Reason to be merry, seeing he had been so kind to me, and had given me Hopes of recovering me from the worst Circumstances that ever Woman of any Sort of Fortune was sunk in∣to; that he could not but believe that what he had said to me was like Life from the Dead; that it was like re∣covering one sick from the Brink of the Grave; how I should ever make him a Return any Way suitable, was what I had not yet had Time to think of; I could only say, that I should never forget it while I had Life, and should be always ready to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>He said, that was all he desired of me, that his Re∣ward would be the Satisfaction of having rescued me from Misery; that he found he was obliging one that knew what Gratitude meant; that he would make it his Business to make me compleatly easy, first or last, if it lay in his Power; and in the mean Time, he bid me consider of any Thing that I thought he might do for me, for my Advantage, and in Order to make me per∣fectly easy.</P>
<P>After we had talked thus, he bid me be chearful; Come, says he, lay aside these melancholy Things, and let us be merry: <HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Table, and she smil'd and laugh'd, and was so merry she could hardly contain it, for the Girl lov'd me to an Excess, hardly to be described; and it was such an unexpected Thing to hear any one talk to her Mistress, that the Wench was besides herself almost, and as soon as Dinner was over, <HI>Amy</HI> went up Stairs, and put on her best Clothes too, and came down dress'd like a Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>We sat together talking of a thousand Things, of what had been, and what was to be, all the rest of the Day, and in the Evening he took his Leave of me, with a thousand Expressions of Kindness and Tender∣ness, and true Affection to me, but offer'd not the least of what my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> had suggested.</P>
<P>At his going away, he took me in his Arms, protest∣ed an honest Kindness to me; said a thousand kind Things to me, which I cannot now recollect; and after kissing me twenty Times, or thereabouts, put a Guinea into my Hand; which, he said, was for my present
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
Supply, and told me that he would see me again before 'twas out; also he gave <HI>Amy</HI> Half a Crown.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> are you con∣vinced now that he is an honest as well as a true Friend, and that there has been nothing, not the least Appear∣ance of any thing of what you imagin'd in his Behaviour: Yes, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I am, but I admire at it; he is such a Friend as the World, sure, has not Abundance of to shew.</P>
<P>I am sure, <HI>says I,</HI> he is such a Friend as I have long wanted, and as I have as much Need of as any Creature in the World has, or ever had; and, in short, I was so overcome with the Comfort of it, that I sat down and cry'd for Joy a good-while, as I had formerly cry'd for Sorrow. <HI>Amy</HI> and I went to Bed that Night (for <HI>Amy</HI> lay with me) pretty early, but lay chatting almost all Night about it, and the Girl was so transported, that she got up two or three Times in the Night, and danc'd about the Room in her Shift; in short, the Girl was half distracted with the Joy of it; a Testimony still of her violent Affection for her Mistress, in which no Servant ever went beyond her.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two Days, but the third Day he came again; then he told me, with the same Kindness, that he had ordered me a Supply of Houshold-Goods for the furnishing the House; that in particular, he had sent me back all the Goods that he had seized for Rent, which consisted, indeed, of the best of my former Furniture; and now, says he, I'll tell you what I have had in my Head for you, for your present Supply, and that is, <HI>says he,</HI> that the House being well furnished, you shall let it out to Lodgings for the Sum∣mer-Gentry, <HI>says he,</HI> by which you will easily get a good comfortable Subsistance, especially seeing you shall pay me no Rent for two Years, nor after neither, unless you can afford it.</P>
<P>This was the first View I had of living comfortably indeed, and it was a very probable Way, I must con∣fess; seeing we had very good Conveniencies, six Rooms on a Floor, and three Stories high: While he was lay∣ing down the Scheme of my Management, came a Cart to the Door with a Load of Goods, and an Upholster∣er's
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
Man to put them up; they were chiefly the Furni∣ture of two Rooms, which he had carried away for his two Years Rent, with two fine Cabinets, and some Peir-Glasses out of the Parlour, and several other valuable Things.</P>
<P>These were all restored to their Places, and he told me he gave them me freely, as a Satisfaction for the Cruel∣ty he had used me with before; and the Furniture of one Room being finished and set up, he told me, he would furnish one Chamber for himself, and would come and be one of my Lodgers, if I would give him Leave.</P>
<P>I told him he ought not to ask me Leave, who had so much Right to make himself welcome; so the House began to look in some tolerable Figure, and clean; the Garden also, in about a Fortnight's Work, began to look something less like a Wilderness than it us'd to do; and he ordered me to put up a Bill for letting Rooms, reserving one for himself, to come as he saw Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>When all was done to his Mind, as to placing the Goods, he seem'd very well pleased, and we dined toge∣ther again of his own providing, and the Upholster's Man gone; after Dinner he took me by the Hand, Come now, Madam, says he, you must shew me your House, (for he had a Mind to see every Thing over again) No, Sir, said I, but I'll go shew you your House, if you please; so we went up thro' all the Rooms, and in the Room which was appointed for himself, <HI>Amy</HI> was doing something; Well, <HI>Amy,</HI> says he, I intend to lye with you to Morrow-night; <HI>To Night, if you please, Sir,</HI> says <HI>Amy</HI> very innocently, <HI>your Room is quite ready:</HI> Well, <HI>Amy,</HI> says he, I am glad you are so willing: No, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I mean your Chamber is ready To-night, and away she run out of the Room asham'd enough; for the Girl meant no Harm, whatever she had said to me in Private.</P>
<P>However, he said no more then; but when <HI>Amy</HI> was gone, he walked about the Room, and look'd at every Thing, and taking me by the Hand, he kiss'd me, and spoke a great many kind affectionate Things to me in∣deed;
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
as of his Measures for my Advantage, and what he would do to raise me again in the World; told me, that my Afflictions, and the Conduct I had shewn in bearing them to such an Extremity, had so engaged him to me, that he valued me infinitely above all the Women in the World; that tho' he was under such Engagements that he could not marry me, [his Wife and he had been parted for some Reasons, which make too long a Story to intermix with mine] yet that he would be every Thing else that a Woman could ask in a Husband, and with that he kiss'd me again, and took me in his Arms, but offered not the least uncivil Action to me, and told me he hoped I would not deny him all the Favours he should ask, because he resolved to ask nothing of me but what was fit for a Woman of Virtue and Modesty, for such he knew me to be, to yield.</P>
<P>I confess, the terrible Pressure of my former Misery, the Memory of which lay heavy upon my Mind, and the surprising Kindness with which he had delivered me, and withal, the Expectations of what he might still do for me, were powerful Things, and made me have scarce the Power to deny him any Thing he wou'd ask; however, I told him thus, with an Heir of Tenderness too, that he had done so much for me, that I thought I ought to deny him nothing, only I hoped and depended upon him, that he would not take the Advantage of the infinite Obligations I was under to him, to desire any Thing of me, the yielding to which would lay me lower in his Esteem than I desired to be; that as I took him to be a Man of Honour, so I knew he could not like me the better for doing any Thing that was below a Woman of Honesty and good Manners to do.</P>
<P>He told me that he had done all this for me, without so much as telling me what Kindness or real Affection he had for me; that I might not be under any Necessity of yielding to him in any Thing for Want of Bread; and he would no more oppress my Gratitude now than he would my Necessity before, nor ask any Thing, sup∣posing he would stop his Favours, or withdraw his Kind∣ness, if he was denied; it was true, he said, he might tell me more freely his Mind now than before, seeing I
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
had let him see that I accepted his Assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his Design of serving me; that he had gone thus far to shew me that he was kind to me, but that now he would tell me, that he lov'd me, and yet would demonstrate that his Love was both honourable, and that what he should desire was what he might honest∣ly ask, and I might honestly grant.</P>
<P>I answered, that within those two Limitations, I was sure I ought to deny him nothing, and I should think myself not ungrateful only, but very unjust, if I should; so he said no more, but I observed he kissed me more, and took me in his Arms in a kind of familiar Way, more than usual, and which once or twice put me in Mind of my Maid <HI>Amy</HI>'s Words; and yet, I must ac∣knowledge, I was so overcome with his Goodness to me in those many kind Things he had done, that I not only was easy at what he did, and made no Resistance, but was inclined to do the like, whatever he had offer'd to do: But he went no farther than what I have said, nor did he so much as offer to sit down on the Bed-side with me, but took his Leave, said he loved metenderly, and would convince me of it by such Demonstrations as should be to my Satisfaction. I told him I had a great deal of Reason to believe him; that he was full Master of the whole House, and of me, as far as was within the Bounds we had spoken of, which I believed he would not break; and ask'd him if he would not lodge there that Night.</P>
<P>He said, he cou'd not well stay that Night, Business requiring him in <HI>London,</HI> but added, smiling, that he wou'd come the next Day, and take a Night's Lodging with me. I press'd him to stay that Night, and told him, I should be glad a Friend so valuable should be under the same Roof with me; and indeed, I began at that Time not only to be much oblig'd to him, but to love him too, and that in a Manner that I had not been acquainted with myself.</P>
<P>O let no Woman slight the Temptation that being generously delivered from Trouble, is to any Spirit furnish'd with Gratitude and just Principles: This Gen∣tleman had freely and voluntarily deliver'd me from Misery, from Poverty, and Rags; he had made me
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
what I was, and put me into a Way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to live happy and pleas'd, and on his Bounty I depended: What could I say to this Gentleman when he press'd me to yield to him, and argued the Lawfulness of it? But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>I press'd him again to stay that Night, and told him it was the first compleatly happy Night that I had ever had in the House in my Life, and I should be very sorry to have it be without his Company, who was the Cause and Foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but that it could never be without him; and, in short, I courted him so, that he said, he cou'd not deny me, but he would take his Horse, and go to <HI>London,</HI> do the Business he had to do, which, it seems, was to pay a foreign Bill that was due that Night, and wou'd else be protested; and that he wou'd come back in three Hours at farthest, and sup with me, but bade me get nothing there, for since I was resolv'd to be merry, which was what he desir'd above all Things, he wou'd send me something from <HI>London,</HI> and we will make it a wedding Supper, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> and with that Word, took me in his Arms, and kiss'd me so vehe∣mently, that I made no Question but he intended to do every Thing else that <HI>Amy</HI> had talk'd of.</P>
<P>I started a little at the Word <HI>Wedding:</HI> What do ye mean, to call it by such a Name? <HI>says I;</HI> adding, we will have a Supper, but t'other is impossible, as well on your Side as mine; he laugh'd, Well, says he, you shall call it what you will, but it may be the same Thing, for I shall satisfy you, it is not so impossible as you make it.</P>
<P>I don't understand you, said I, have not I a Hus∣band, and you a Wise?</P>
<P>Well, well, says he, we will talk of that after Su∣per; so he rose up, gave me another Kiss, and took his Horse for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This kind of Discourse had fir'd my Blood, I con∣fess, and I knew not what to think of it; it was plain now that he intended to lye with me, but how he would reconcile it to a legal Thing, like a Marriage, that I cou'd not imagine: We had both of us us'd <HI>Amy</HI> with so
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>
much Intimacy, and trusted her with every Thing, having such unexampled Instances of her Fidelity, that he made no Scruple to kiss me, and say all these Things to me before her, nor had he car'd one Farthing if I would have let him lay with me, to have had <HI>Amy</HI> there too all Night. When he was gone, Well, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I, what will all this come to now? I am all in a Sweat at him: Come to, Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I see what it will come to, I must put you to Bed to Night together: Why you wou'd not be so impudent, you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade you, <HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I,</HI> wou'd you? Yes, I wou'd, says she, with all my Heart, and think you both as honest as ever you were in your Lives.</P>
<P>What ails the Siut to talk so? <HI>Said I,</HI> honest! how can it be honest? Why, I'll tell you, Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I sounded it as soon as I heard him speak, and it is very true too; he calls you Widow, and such, indeed, you are; for as my Master has left you so many Years, he is dead to be sure; at least, he is dead to you; he is no Husband; you are, and ought to be free to marry who you will; and his Wife being gone from him, and refusing to lie with him, then he is a single Man again, as much as ever; and though you cannot bring the Laws of the Land to join you together, yet one refusing to do the Office of a Wife, and the other of a Husband, you may certainly take one another fairly.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> if I cou'd take him fairly, you may be sure I'd take him above all the Men in the World; it turn'd the very Heart within me, when I heard him say he lov'd me; how could it do otherwise! when you know what a Condition I was in before, despis'd, and trampled on by all the World; I cou'd have took him in my Arms, and kiss'd him as freely as he did me, if it had not been for Shame.</P>
<P>Ay, and all the rest too, says <HI>Amy,</HI> at the first Word; I don't see how you can think of denying him any Thing; has he not brought you out of the Devil's Clutches; brought you out of the blackest Misery that ever poor Lady was reduc'd to? Can a Woman deny such a Man any Thing?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="41"/>
Nay, I don't know what to do, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I; I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope he won't desire any Thing of that Kind of me, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope he won't attempt it; if he does, I know not what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say to him.</P>
<P>Not ask you, says <HI>Amy,</HI> depend upon it, he will ask <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou, and you will grant it too; I'm sure my Mistress <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no Fool; come, pray Madam, let me go air you a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean Shift; don't let him find you in foul Linnen the Wedding-Night.</P>
<P>But that I know you to be a very honest Girl, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> you wou'd make me abhor you; why you argue <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Devil, as if you were one of his privy-Counsel∣ors.</P>
<P>It's no Matter for that, Madam, I say nothing but what I think; you own you love this Gentleman, and he has given you sufficient Testimony of his Affection to you; your Conditions are alike unhappy, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Opinion that he may take another Woman, his first Wife having broke her Honour, and living from him; and that tho' the Laws of the Land will not al∣how him to marry formally, yet that he may take ano∣ther Woman into his Arms, provided he keeps true to the other Woman as a Wife; nay, he says, it is usual to do so, and allow'd by the Custom of the Place, in several Countries abroad; and, I must own, I'm of the same Mind; else 'tis in the Power of a Whore, after he has jilted and abandon'd her Husband, to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine him from the Pleasure as well as Convenience of a Woman all the Days of his Life, which would be very unreasonable; and as Times go, not tolerable to all People; and the like on your Side, Madam.</P>
<P>Had I now had my Senses about me, and had my Reason not been overcome by the powerful Attraction of so kind, so beneficent a Friend; had I consulted Conscience and Virtue, I shou'd have repell'd this <HI>Amy,</HI> however faithful and honest to me in other Things, as Viper, and Engine of the Devil; I ought to have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emembred that neither he nor I, either by the Laws of God or Man, cou'd come together, upon any other Terms than that of notorious Adultery: The ignorant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade's Argument, that he had brought me out of the
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
Hands of the Devil, by which he meant the Devil of Poverty and Distress, shou'd have been a powerful Mo∣tive to me, not to plunge myself into the Jaws of Hell, and into the Power of the real Devil, in Recompence for that Deliverance. I shou'd have look'd upon all the Good this Man had done for me, to have been the par∣ticular Work of the Goodness of Heaven; and that Goodness should have mov'd me to a Return of Duty and humble Obedience; I shou'd have receiv'd the Mercy thankfully, and apply'd it soberly, to the Praise and Honour of my Maker; whereas by this wicked Course, all the Bounty and Kindness of this Gentleman became a Snare to me, was a meer Bait to the Devil's Hook; I receiv'd his Kindness at the dear Expence of Body an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soul, mortgaging Faith, Religion, Conscience, and Modesty, for (as I may call it) a morsel of Bread; or, if you will, ruin'd my Soul from a Principle of Grati∣tude, and gave myself up to the Devil, to shew myself grateful to my Benefactor: I must do the Gentleman that Justice, as to say, I verily believe that he did no∣thing but what he thought was lawful; and I must do that Justice upon mysel, as to say, I did what my own Conscience convinc'd me at the very Time I did it, was horribly unlawful, scandalous, and abominable.</P>
<P>But Poverty was my Share; dreadful Poverty! the Misery I had been in, was great, such as wou'd make the Heart tremble at the Apprehensions of its Return; and I might appeal to any that has had any Experience of the World, whether one so entirely destitute as I was, of all Manner of all Helps, or Friends, either to sup∣port me, or to assist me to support myself, could with∣stand the Proposal; not that I plead this as a Justifica∣tion of my Conduct, but that it may move the Pity, even of those that abhor the Crime.</P>
<P>Besides this, I was young, handsome, and with all the Mortifications I had met with, was vain, and that not a little; and as it was a new Thing, so it was a pleasant thing, to be courted, caress'd, embrac'd, and high Professions of Affection made to me by a Man so agreeable, and so able to do me good.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="43"/>
Add to this, that if I had ventur'd to disoblige this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entleman, I had no Friend in the World to have re∣burse to; I had no Prospect, no, not of a Bit of Bread; had nothing before me, but to fall back into the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isery that I had been in before.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had but too much Rhetorick in this Cause; she presented all those Things in their proper Colours; she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgued them all with her utmost Skill, and at last, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erry Jade, when she came to dress me, Look ye, Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> if you won't consent, tell him you'll <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as <HI>Rachael</HI> did to <HI>Jacob,</HI> when she could have no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hildien, put her Maid to Bed to him; tell him you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot comply with him, but there's <HI>Amy,</HI> he may ask <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Question, she has promis'd me she won't deny <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou.</P>
<P>And wou'd you have me say so, <HI>Amy? said I.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, but I wou'd really have you do so, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou are undone if you do not; and if my doing it wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave you from being undone, as I said before, he shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he will; if he asks me, I won't deny him, not I; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ang me if I do, <HI>says Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Wed, I know not what to do, <HI>says I</HI> to <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Do! <HI>says Amy,</HI> Your Choice is fair and plain; here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may have a handsome, charming Gentleman, be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich, live pleasantly, and in Plenty; or refuse him, and want a Dinner, go in Rags, live in Tears; in short beg and starve; you know this is the Case, Madam, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I wonder how you can say you know not what to do.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> the Case is as you say, and I think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erily I must yield to him; but then, <HI>said I, mov'd by Conscience,</HI> don't talk any more of your Cant, of its be∣ing lawful that I ought to marry again, and that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to marry again, and such Stuff as that; 'tis all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsense, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> there's nothing in it, let me hear <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o more of that; for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the Matter, I am a Whore, <HI>Amy,</HI> neither better nor worse, assure you.</P>
<P>I don't think so, Madam, by no Means, <HI>says Amy,</HI> I wonder how you can talk so; and then she run on with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Argument of the Unreasonableness that a Woman

should be oblig'd to live single, or a Man to live single in such Cases, as before: Well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> come let us dispute no more, for the longer I enter into that Part, the greater my Scruples will be; but if I let it alone, the Necessity of my present Circumstances is such, that I believe I shall yield to him, if he should importune me much about it, but I should be glad he would not do it at all, but leave me as I am.</P>
<P>As to that, Madam, you may depend, <HI>says Amy,</HI> he expects to have you for his Bedfellow to Night; I saw it plainly in his Management all Day, and at last he told you so too, as plain, I think, as he cou'd: Well, well, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> I don't know what to say, if he will, he must, I think I don't know how to resist such a Man, that has done so much for me: I don't know how you shou'd, <HI>says Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Amy</HI> and I canvass'd the Business between us; the Jade prompted the Crime, which I had but too much Inclination to commit; that is to say, not as a Crime, for I had nothing of the Vice in my Constitution; my Spirits were far from being high; my Blood had no Fire in it, to kindle the Flame of Desire; but the Kind∣ness and good Humour of the Man, and the Dread of my own Circumstances concurr'd to bring me to the Point, and I even resolv'd before he ask'd, to give up my Virtue to him, whenever he should put it to the Question.</P>
<P>In this I was a double Offender, whatever he was; for I was resolved to commit the Crime, knowing and owning it to be a Crime; he, if it was true as he said, was fully perswaded it was lawful, and in that Perswasi∣on he took the Measures, and used all the Circumlocuti∣ons which I am going to speak of.</P>
<P>About two Hours after he was gone, came a <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> Basket-woman, with a whole Load of good Things for the Mouth, the Particulars are not to the Purpose, and brought Orders to get Supper by eight o'Clock; however, I did not intend to begin to dress any Thing till I saw him; and he gave me Time enough, for he came before seven; so that <HI>Amy,</HI> who had gotten one to help her, got every Thing ready in Time.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45"/>
We sat down to Supper about eight, and were indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery merry; <HI>Amy</HI> made us some Sport, for she was a Girl of Spirit and Wit; and with her Talk she made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s laugh very often, and yet the Jade managed her Wit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith all the good Manners imaginable.</P>
<P>But to shorten the Story; after Supper, he took me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p into his Chamber, where <HI>Amy</HI> had made a good Fire, and there he pull'd out a great many Papers, and spread them upon a little Table, and then took me by the Hand, and after kissing me very much, he enter'd in∣to a Discourse of his Circumstances, and of mine, how they agreed in several Things exactly; for Example, That I was abandon'd of a Husband in the Prime of my Youth and Vigour, and he of a Wife in his middle Age; how the End of Marriage was destroyed by the Treatment we had either of us receiv'd; and it wou'd be very hard that we should be ty'd by the Formality of the Contract, where the Essence of it was destroyed: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interrupted him, and told him, There was a vast Difference between our Circumstances, and that in the most essential Part; namely, That he was Rich, and I was Poor; that he was above the World, and I infinite∣ly below it; that his Circumstances were very easy, mine miserable, and this was an Inequality the most essential that could be imagin'd: As to that, my Dear, says he, I have taken such Measures as shall make an Equality still; and with that, he shew'd me a Contract in Writing, wherein he engaged himself to me; to co∣habit constantly with me; to provide for me in all Re∣spects as a Wise; and repeating in the Preamble, a long Account of the Nature and Reason of our living together, and an Obligation in the Penalty of 7000 l. never to abandon me; and at last shewed me a Bond for 500 l. to be paid to me, or to my Assigns, within three Months after his Death.</P>
<P>He read over all these Things to me, and then in a most moving, affectionate Manner, and in Words not to be answer'd, he said, Now, my Dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object any Thing against it? If not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this Matter
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
no longer; with that, he pull'd out a silk Purse, which had threescore Guineas in it, and threw them into my Lap, and concluded all the rest of his Discourse with Kisses, and Protestations of his Love; of which indeed, I had abundant Proof.</P>
<P>Pity human Frailty, you that read of a Woman re∣duc'd in her Youth, and Prime, to the utmost Misery and Distress; and rais'd again, as above, by the un∣expected and surprizing Bounty of a Stranger; I say, pity her it she was not able, after all these Things, to make any more Resistance.</P>
<P>However, I stood out a little longer still; I ask'd him, how he cou'd come into a Proposal of such Con∣sequence, the very first Time it was mov'd to me? and that I ought, if I consented to it, to capitulate with him, that he should never upbraid me with Easi∣ness, and consenting too soon. He said, No, but on the contrary, he would take it as a Mark of the great∣est Kindness I could show him; then he went on to give Reasons why there was no Occasion to use the ordinary Ceremony of Delay; or to wait a reasonable Time of Courtship, which was only to avoid Scandal; but, as this was private, it had nothing of that Nature in it; that he had been courting me some Time, by the best of Courtship, <HI>viz.</HI> doing Acts of Kindeness to me; and that he had given Testimonies of his sincere Affection to me, by Deeds, not by flattering Trisles, and the usual Courtship of Words, which were often found to have very little Meaning; that he took me not as a Mistress, but as his Wise; and protested, it was clear to him he might lawfully do it, and that I was perfectly at Liberty; and assured me by all that it was possible for an honest Man to say, that he would treat me as his Wise, as long as he lived; in a Word, he conquer'd all the little Resistance I intended to make; he protested he loved me above all the World, and begg'd I would for once believe him; that he had ne∣ver deceiv'd me, and never would, but would make it his Study to make my Life comfortable and happy, and to make me forget the Misery I had gone through: I
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
stood still a while, and said nothing, but seeing him eager for my Answer, I smil'd, and looking up at him; And must I then, says I, say Yes, at first asking? Must I depend upon your Promise? Why then, said I, upon the Faith of that Promise, and in the Sense of that inexpressible Kindness you have shown me, you shall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the End of my Life: and with that, I took his Hand which held me by the Hand, and gave it a Kiss.</P>
<P>And thus in Gratitude for the Favours I receiv'd from a Man, was all Sense of Religion, and Duty to God, all Regard to Virtue and Honour, given up at once, and we were to call one another Man and Wife, who in the Sense of the Laws, both of God and our Country, were no more than two Adulterers, in short, a Whore and a Rogue; nor, as I have said above, was my Conscience silent in it, though, it seems, his was; for I sinn'd with open Eyes, and thereby had a double Guilt upon me; as I always said his Notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the Opini∣on, or argued himself into it now, that we were both free, and might lawfully marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another Side, nay, and my Judg∣ment was right, but my Circumstances were my Temp∣tation; the Terrors behind me look'd blacker than the Terrors before me; and the dreadful Argument of wanting Bread, and being run into the horrible Distres∣ses I was in before, master'd all my Resolution, and I gave myself up as above.</P>
<P>The rest of the Evening we spent very agreeably to me; he was perfectly good-humour'd, and was at that Time very merry; then he made <HI>Amy</HI> dance with him, and I told him I would put <HI>Amy</HI> to Bed to him. <HI>Amy</HI> said, with all her Heart, she never had been a Bride in her Life; in short, he made the Girl so merry, that had he not been to lye with me the same Night, I be∣lieve he would have played the Fool with <HI>Amy</HI> for half an Hour, and the Girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do; yet before, I had always found her a very modest Wench, as any I ever saw in all my
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
Life; but, in short, the Mirth of that Night, and a few more such afterwards, ruined the Girl's Modesty for ever, as shall appear by and by, in its Place.</P>
<P>So far does fooling and toying sometimes go, that I know nothing a young Woman has to be more cautious of; so far had this innocent Girl gone in jesting be∣tween her and I, and in talking that she would let him lye with her, if he would but be kinder to me, that at last she let him lye with her in earnest; and so empty was I now of all Principle, that I encouraged the do∣ing it almost before my Face.</P>
<P>I say but too justly, that I was empty of Principle, because, as above, I had yielded to him, not as deluded to believe it lawful, but as overcome by his Kindness, and terrify'd at the Fear of my own Misery if he should leave me; so with my Eyes open, and with my Con∣science, as I may say, awake, I sinn'd, knowing it to be a Sin, but having no Power to resist; when this had thus made a Hole in my Heart, and I was come to such a Height, as to transgress against the Light of my own Conscience, I was then fit for any Wickedness, and Conscience left off speaking, where it found it could not be heard.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story; having consented, as a∣bove, to his Proposal, we had not much more to do; he gave me my Writings, and the Bond for my Main∣tenance during his Life, and for 500 <HI>l.</HI> after his Death; and so far was he from abating his Affection to me af∣terwards, that two Years after we were thus, as he call'd it, marry'd, he made his Will, and gave me a thou∣sand Pounds more, and all my Houshold stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was considerable too.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> put us to Bed, and my new Friend, I cannot call him Husband, was so well pleased with <HI>Amy</HI> for her Fidelity and Kindness to me, that he paid her all the Arrear of her Wages that I ow'd her, and gave her five Guineas over, and had it gone no farther, <HI>Amy</HI> had richly deserved what she had, for never was a Maid so true to a Mistress in such dreadful Circumstances as I was in; nor was what followed more her own Fault
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
than mine, who led her almost into it at first, and quite into it at last; and this may be a farther Testimony what a Hardness of Crime I was now arrived to, which was owing to the Conviction that was from the Beginning, upon me, that I was a Whore not a Wife; nor could I ever frame my Mouth to call him Husband, or to say my Husband when I was speaking of him.</P>
<P>We liv'd, surely, the most agreeable Life, the grand Exception only excepted, that ever two lived together; he was the most obliging gentlemanly Man, and the most tender of me, that ever Woman gave herself up to; nor was there ever the least Interruption to our mutual Kindness, no, not to the last Day of his Life: But I must b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Amy</HI>'s Disaster in at once, that I may have done with her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was dressing me one Morning, for now I had two Maids, and <HI>Amy</HI> was my Chamber-Maid. Dear Ma∣dam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, what a'n't you with Child yet? No, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I, nor any Sign of it: Law, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy, what have you been doing? Why you have been married a Year and a half, I warrant you, Master would have got me with Child twice in that Time: It may be so, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I, let him try, can't you: No, <HI>says</HI> Amy, you'll sorbid it now; before I told you he should with all my Heart, but I won't now, now he's all your own: O, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> I'll freely give you my Consent, it will be nothing at all to me; nay, I'll put you to Bed to him myself one Night or other, if you are willing: No, Madam, no, <HI>says Amy,</HI> not now he's yours.</P>
<P>Why you Fool you, <HI>says I,</HI> don't I tell you I'll put you to Bed to him myself.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, <HI>says</HI> Amy, if you put me to Bed to him, that is another Case; I believe I shall not rise again very soon.</P>
<P>I'll venture that, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I.</P>
<P>After Supper, that Night, and before we were risen from the Table, <HI>I said to him, Amy</HI> being by, Hark ye, Mr.—, Do you know that you are to lye with <HI>Amy</HI> to Night? No, not I, <HI>says he;</HI> but turns to <HI>Amy,</HI> Is it so, <HI>Amy,</HI> says he? No, Sir, <HI>says she;</HI> Nay, don't
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
say no, you Fool; did not I promise to put you to B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i to him? But the Girl said No still, and it pass'd off.</P>
<P>At Night, when we came to go to Bed, <HI>Amy</HI> came into the Chamber to undress me, and her Master slipt into Bed first; then I began, and told him all that <HI>A∣my</HI> had said about my not being with Child, and of her being with Child twice in that Time: Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> I believe so too, come hither, and we'll try; but <HI>Amy</HI> did not go: Go, you Fool, <HI>says I,</HI> can't you, I freely give you both Leave; but <HI>Amy</HI> would not go: Nay, you Whore, <HI>says I,</HI> you said, if I would put you to Bed, you would with all your Heart. And with that, I sat her down, pull'd off her Stockings and Shoes, and all her Cloaths, Piece by Piece, and led her to the Bed to him; <HI>Here,</HI> says I, <HI>try what you can do with your Maid</HI> Amy: She pull'd back a little, would not let me pull off her Cloaths at first, but it was hot Weather, and she had not many Cloaths on, and par∣ticularly no Stays on; and at last, when she saw I was in earnest, she let me do what I would; so I sairly stript her, and then I threw open the Bed, and thrust her in.</P>
<P>I need say no more; this is enough to convince any Body that I did not think him my Husband, and that I had cast off all Principle, and all Modesty, and had effectually stifled Conscience.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> I dare say, began now to repent, and would sain have got out of Bed again; but he said to her, Nay, <HI>Amy,</HI> you see your Mistress has put you to Bed, 'tis all her doing, you must blame her; so he held her fast, and the Wench being naked in the Bed with him, 'twas too late to look back, so she lay still and let him do what he would with her.</P>
<P>Had I look'd upon myself as a Wife, you cannot sup∣pose I would have been willing to have let my Hus∣band lye with my Maid, much less before my Face, for I stood by all the while; but as I thought myself a Whore, I cannot say but that it was something design∣ed in my Thoughts, that my Maid should be a Whore too, and should not reproach me with it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51"/>
<HI>Amy,</HI> however, less vicious than I, was grievously out of Sorts the next Morning, and cryed and took on most vehemently; that she was ruin'd and undone, and there was no pacisying her; she was a Whore, a Slut, and she was undone! undone! and cry'd almost all Day; I did all I could to pacisy her: A Whore, <HI>says I,</HI> well, and am not I a Whore as well as you? No, no, <HI>says</HI> Amy, no, you are not, for you are married; not I, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I, I do not pretend to it; he may marry you to Morrow if he will, for any Thing I could do to hinder it, I am not marry'd; I do not look up∣on it as any Thing: Well, all did not pacify <HI>Amy,</HI> but she cryed two or three Days about it; but it wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>But the Case differ'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and her Master, exceedingly; for <HI>Amy</HI> retain'd the same kind Temper she always had; but on the contrary, he was quite al∣tered, for he hated her heartily, and could, I believe, have killed her after it, and he told me so, for he thought this a vile Action; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly easy in, thought it just, and es∣teem'd me as much his Wife as if we had been mar∣ry'd from our Youth, and had neither of us known a∣ny other; nay, he lov'd me, I believe, as entirely as if I had been the Wife of his Youth; nay, he told me it was true, in one Sense, that he had two Wives, but that I was the Wife of his Affection, the other, the Wife of his Aversion.</P>
<P>I was extreamly concern'd at the Aversion he had taken to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and us'd my utmost Skill to get it alter'd; for tho' he had, indeed, debauch'd the Wench, I knew that I was the principal Occasion of it; and as he was the best humour'd Man in the World, I never gave him over till I prevail'd with him to be easy with her, and as I was now become the Devil's Agent, to make others as wicked as myself, I brought him to lye with her again several Times after that, till at last, as the poor Girl said, so it happen'd, and she was really with Child.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="52"/>
She was terribly concern'd at it, and so was he too: Come, my Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> when <HI>Rachael</HI> put her Hand∣maid to Bed to <HI>Jacoh,</HI> she took the Children as her own; don't be uneasy, I'll take the Child as my own; had not I a Hand in the Frolick of putting her to Bed to you? It was my Fault as much as yours; so I call'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and encourag'd her too, and told her that I would take Care of the Child and her too, and added the same Argument to her; for, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> it was all my Fault; did not I drag your Cloaths off your Back, and put you to Bed to him: Thus I that had, indeed, been the Cause of all the Wickedness between them, en∣couraged them both, when they had any Remorse a∣bout it, and rather prompted them to go on with it, than to repent of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> grew big, she went to a Place I had pro∣vided for her, and the Neighbours knew nothing but that <HI>Amy</HI> and I was parted. She had a fine Child in∣deed, a Daughter, and we had it nurs'd, and <HI>Amy</HI> came again in about half a Year, to live with her old Mistress; but neither my Gentleman, or <HI>Amy</HI> either, car'd for playing that Game over again; for as he said, the Jade might bring him a House full of Children to keep.</P>
<P>We liv'd as merrily, and as happily after this, as could be expected, considering our Circumstances; I mean as to the pretended Marriage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and as to that my Gentleman had not the least Concern about him for it; but as much as I was harden'd, and that was as much as, I believe, ever any wicked Creature was, yet I could not help it, there was, and would be, Hours of Intervals, and of dark Reflections which came invo∣luntarily in, and thrust in Sighs into the middle of all my Songs; and there would be, sometimes, a Heaviness of Heart, which intermingled itself with all my Joy, and which wou'd often fetch a Tear from my Eye; and let others pretend what they will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with any-body; there can be no sub∣stantial Satisfaction in a Life of known Wickedness; Conscience will, and does, often break in upon them
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>
at particular Times, let them do what they can to pre∣vent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and whatever loose Reflections were, and how often soever those dark Intervals came on, I did my utmost to conceal them from him; ay, and to suppress and smother them too in myself, and to outward Appearance we liv'd as chear∣fully, and as agreeably, as it was possible for any Cou∣ple in the World to live.</P>
<P>After I had thus liv'd with him something above two Years, truly, I found myself with Child too; my Gen∣tleman was mightily pleas'd at it, and nothing could be kinder than he was in the Preparations he made for me, and for my Lying in, which was, however, very private, because I car'd for as little Company as possi∣ble; nor had I kept up my neighbourly Acquaintance; so that I had no-body to invite upon such an Occasion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-bed very well, (of a Daughter too, as well as <HI>Amy)</HI> but the Child died at about six Weeks old, so all that Work was to do over again, that is to say, the Charge, the Expence, the Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year I made him amends, and brought him a Son, to his great Satisfaction; it was a charming Child, and did very well: After this, my Husband, as he called himself, came to me one Evening, and told me, he had a very difficult Thing happen'd to him, which he knew not what to do in, or how to re∣solve about, unless I would make him easy; this was, that his Occasions requir'd him to go over to <HI>France</HI> for about two Months.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, says I, and how shall I make you easy?</P>
<P>Why, by consenting to let me go, says he, upon which Condition, I'll tell you the Occasion of my go∣ing, that you may judge of the Necessity there is for it on my Side; then to make me easy in his going, he told me, he would make his Will before he went, which should be to my full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I told him the last Part was so kind, that I could not decline the first Part, unless he would give me
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
Leave to add, that if it was not for putting him to an extraordinary Expence, I would go over along with him.</P>
<P>He was so pleased with this Offer, that he told me, he would give me full Satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; so he took me to <HI>London</HI> with him the next Day, and there he made his Will, and shew'd it to me, and seal'd it before proper Witnesses, and then gave it to me to keep: In this Will he gave a thousand Pounds to a Person that we both knew very well, in Trust, to pay it, with the Interest from the Time of his Decease, to me, or my Assigns; then he will'd the Payment of my Jointure, as he call'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> his Bond of a Hun∣dred Pounds, after his Death; also he gave me all my Houshold-stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was a most engaging Thing for a Man to do to one under my Circumstances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any Thing, or to refuse to go with him any where; so we settled every Thing as well as we cou'd; left <HI>Amy</HI> in Charge with the House; and for his other Business, which was in Jewels, he had two Men he entrusted, whom he had good Security for, and who managed for him, and corresponded with him.</P>
<P>Things being thus concerted, we went away to <HI>France,</HI> arriv'd safe at <HI>Calais,</HI> and by easy Journeys, came in eight Days more to <HI>Paris,</HI> where we lodg'd in the House of an <HI>English</HI> Merchant of his Acquain∣tance, and was very courteously entertain'd.</P>
<P>My Gentleman's Business was with some Persons of the first Rank, and to whom he had sold some Jewels of very good Value, and receiv'd a great Sum of Mo∣ney in Specie, and, as he told me privately, he gain'd 3000 Pistoles by his Bargain, but would not suffer the most intimate Friend he had there, to know what he had receiv'd; for it is not so safe a Thing in <HI>Paris,</HI> to have a great Sum of Money in keeping, as it might be in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>We made this Journey much longer than we intend∣ed; and my Gentleman sent for one of his Managers
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>
in <HI>London,</HI> to come over to us to <HI>Paris</HI> with some Dia∣monds, and sent him back to <HI>London</HI> again to fetch more; then other Business fell into his Hands so unex∣pectedly, that I began to think we should take up our constant Residence there, which I was not very averse to, it being my Native Country, and I spoke the Lan∣guage perfectly well; so we took a good House in <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> and lived very well there; and I sent for <HI>Amy</HI> to come over to me, for I lived gallantly, and my Gen∣tleman was two or three Times going to keep me a Coach, but I declined it, especially at <HI>Paris;</HI> but as they have those Conveniencies by the Day there, at a certain Rate, I had an Equipage provided for me whenever I pleased, and I lived here in a very good Figure, and might have lived higher if I pleased.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this Felicity, a dreadful Disaster befel me, which entirely unhing'd all my Af∣fairs, and threw me back into the same State of Life that I was in before; with this one happy Exception however, that whereas before I was poor, even to Misery, now I was not only provided for, but very rich.</P>
<P>My Gentleman had the Name in <HI>Paris,</HI> for a very rich Man, and indeed, he was so, though not so im∣mensely rich as People imagin'd; but that which was fatal to him, was, that he generally carried a shagreen Case in his Pocket, especially when he went to Court, or to the Houses of any of the Princes of the Blood, in which he had Jewels of very great Value.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, that being to go to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to wait upon the Prince of—, he came up into my Chamber in the Morning, and laid out his Jewel∣case, because he was not going to show any Jewels, but to get a Foreign Bill accepted, which he had received from <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> so when he gave me the Case, he said, my Dear, I think I need not carry this with me, because, it may be, I may not come back till Night, and it is too much to venture; I return'd, then my Dear, you sha'n't go; Why? says he; because as they are too much for you, so you are too much for me to
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>
venture; and you shall not go, unless you will pro∣mise me not to stay so as to come back in the Night.</P>
<P>I hope there's no Danger, said he, seeing I have no∣thing about me of any Value; and therefore, lest I should, take that too, says he, and gives me his Gold Watch, and a rich Diamond, which he had in a Ring, and always wore on his Finger.</P>
<P>Well, but my Dear, says I, you make me more un∣casy now, than before; for if you apprehend no Dan∣ger, why do you use this Caution? and if you appre∣hend there is Danger, why do you go at all?</P>
<P>There is no Danger, says he, if I do not stay late, and I do not design to do so.</P>
<P>Well, but promise me then, that you won't, says I, or else I cannot let you go.</P>
<P>I wont, indeed, my Dear, says he, unless I am oblig'd to it; I assure you I do not intend it; but if I shou'd, I am not worth robbing now; for I have no∣thing about me, but about six Pistoles in my little Purse, and that Ring, showing me a small Diamond Ring, worth about ten or twelve Pistoles, which he put upon his Finger, in the Room of the rich one he usually wore.</P>
<P>I still press'd him not to stay late, and he said he wou'd not; but if I am kept late, says he, beyond my Expectation, I'll stay all Night, and come next Mor∣ning: This seem'd a very good Caution; but still my Mind was very uneasy about him, and I told him so, and entreated him not to go; I told him, I did not know what might be the Reason, but that I had a strange Terror upon my Mind, about his going, and that, if he did go, I was perswaded some Harm wou'd attend him; he smil'd, and return'd, Well, my Dear, if it should be so, you are now richly provided for; all that I have here, I give to you; and with that, he takes up the Casket, or Case, Here, says he, hold your Hand, there is a good Estate for you, in this Case; if any Thing happens to me, 'tis all your own, I give it you for yourself; and with that, he put the Casket, the fine Ring, and his Gold Watch, all into

my Hands, and the Key of his Scrutore besides, adding, and in my Scruture there is some Money, 'tis all your own.</P>
<P>I star'd at him, as if I was frighted, for I thought all his Face look'd like a Death's-Head; and then, immediately, I thought I perceiv'd his Head all bloody; and then his Cloaths look'd bloody too; and immedi∣ately it all went off, and he look'd as he really did; im∣mediately I fell a crying, and hung about him, my Dear, said I, I am frighted to Death; you shall not go, depend upon it, some Mischief will befal you; I did not tell him how my vapourish Fancy had represented him to me, that I thought was not proper; besides, he wou'd only have laugh'd at me, and wou'd have gone away with a Jest about it: But I press'd him seriously not to go that Day, or if he did, to promise me to come Home to <HI>Paris</HI> again by Day-light: He look'd a little graver then, than he did before; told me, he was not apprehensive of the least Danger; but if there was, he wou'd either take Care to come in the Day, or, as he had said before, wou'd stay all Night.</P>
<P>But all these Promises came to nothing; for he was set upon in the open Day, and robb'd, by three Men on Horseback, mask'd, as he went; and one of them, who, it seems, risted him, while the rest stood to stop the Coach, stabb'd him into the Body with a Sword, so that he died immediately: He had a Footman be∣hind the Coach, whom they knock'd down with the Stock, or But-end of a Carabine: They were suppos'd to kill him, because of the Disappointment they met with, in not getting his Case, or Casket of Diamonds, which they knew he carry'd about him; and this was suppos'd, because after they had kill'd him, they made the Coachman drive out of the Road, a long Way over the Heath, till they came to a convenient Place, where they pull'd him out of the Coach, and search'd his Cloaths more narrowly, than they cou'd do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little Ring, six Pi∣stoles, and the Value of about seven Livres in small Moneys.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58"/>
This was a dreadful Blow to me; tho' I cannot say I was so surpriz'd as I should otherwise have been; for all the while he was gone, my Mind was oppress'd with the Weight of my own Thoughts; and I was as sure that I should never see him any more, that I think nothing could be like it; the Impression was so strong, that, I think, nothing could make so deep a Wound, that was imaginary; and I was so dejected, and discon∣solate, that when I receiv'd the News of his Disaster, there was no Room for any extraordinary Alteration in me: I had cry'd all that Day, eat nothing, and only waited, as I might say, to receive the dismal News, which I had brought to me about five a Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a strange Country; and tho' I had a pretty many Acquaintances, had but very few Friends that I could consult on this Occasion; all possible Enquiry was made after the Rogues, that had been thus barbarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it possible, that the Footman could make any Discovery of them, by his Description; for they knock'd him down im∣mediately, so that he knew nothing of what was done afterwards; the Coachman was the only Man that cou'd say any Thing, and all his Account amounted to no more than this, that one of them had Soldiers Cloaths, but he cou'd not remember the Particulars of his mount∣ing, so as to know what Regiment he belong'd to; and as to their Faces, that he could know nothing of, be∣cause they had all of them Masks on.</P>
<P>I had him buried as decently as the Place would permit a protestant Stranger to be buried, and made some of the Scruples and Difficulties on that Account, easy, by the Help of Money to a certain Person, who went impudently to the Curate of the Parish St. <HI>Sal∣pitius,</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him, that the Gentleman that was kill'd, was a Catholick; that the Thieves had taken from him a Cross of Gold, set with Diamonds, worth 6000 Livres; that his Widow was a Catholick, and had sent by him 60 Crowns to the Church of—, for Masses to be said for the Repose of his Soul: Upon
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>
all which, <HI>tho' not one Word of it was true,</HI> he was bu∣ried with all the Ceremonies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I think I almost cry'd my self to Death for him; for I abandon'd myself to all the Excesses of Grief; and indeed, I lov'd him to a Degree inexpressible; and considering what Kindness he had shewn me at first, and how tenderly he had us'd me to the last, what cou'd I do Iess?</P>
<P>Then the Manner of his Death was terrible and fright∣ful to me, and above all, the strange Notices I had of it; I had never pretended to the Second-Sight, or any Thing of the Kind; but certainly, if any one ever had such a Thing, I had it at this Time; for I saw him as plainly in all those terrible Shapes, as above, <HI>First,</HI> as a Skeleton, not dead only, but rotten and wasted; <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> as kill'd, and his Face bloody; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> his Cloaths bloody; and all within the Space of one Minute, or indeed, of a very few Moments.</P>
<P>These Things amaz'd me, and I was a good-while as one stupid; however, after some Time, I began to recover and look into my Affairs; I had the Satisfaction not to be left in Distress, or in Danger of Poverty; on the contrary, besides what he had put into my Hands fairly, in his Life-Time, which amounted to a very considerable Value, I found above seven Hundred Pi∣stoles in Gold, in his Scrutore; of which he had given me the Key; and I found foreign Bills accepted, for about 12000 Livres: so that, in a Word, I found my∣self possess'd of almost ten Thousand Pounds Sterling, in a very few Days after the Disaster.</P>
<P>The first Thing I did upon this Occasion, was, to send a Letter to my Maid, as I still call'd her, <HI>Amy;</HI> wherein I gave her an Account of my Disaster; how my Husband, as she call'd him <HI>(for I never call'd him so)</HI> was murther'd; and as I did not know how his Re∣lations, or his Wife's Friends, might act upon this Oc∣casion, I order'd her to convey away all the Plate, Lin∣nen, and other Things of Value, and to secure them in a Person's Hands that I directed her to, and then to sell, or dispose the Furniture of the House, if she could; and so, without acquainting any-body with the Reason
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>
of her going, withdraw; sending Notice to his Head Manager at <HI>London,</HI> that the House was quitted by the Tenant, and they might come and take Possession of it for the Executors: <HI>Amy</HI> was so dext'rous, and did her Work so nimbly, that she gutted the House, and sent the Key to the said Manager, almost as soon as he had Notice of the Misfortune that befel their Master.</P>
<P>Upon their receiving the surprizing News of his Death, the Head Manager came over to <HI>Paris,</HI> and came to the House; I made no Scruple of calling my∣self Madam—, the Widow of Monsieur—, the <HI>English</HI> Jeweller; and as I spoke <HI>French</HI> naturally, I did not let him know but that I was his Wife, mar∣ried in <HI>France,</HI> and that I had not heard that he had any Wife in <HI>England;</HI> but pretended to be surpriz'd, and exclaim against him for so base an Action; and that I had good Friends in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where I was born, who would take Care to have Justice done me in <HI>England,</HI> out of his Estate.</P>
<P>I should have observ'd, that as soon as the News was publick, of a Man being murder'd, and that he was a Jeweller, Fame did me the Favour as to publish pre∣sently, that he was robb'd of his Casket of Jewels, which he always carry'd about him. I confirm'd this, among my daily Lamentations for his Disaster, and added, that he had with him a fine Diamond Ring, which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at 100 Pistoles, a Gold Watch, and a great Quantity of Diamonds of inestimable Value, in his Casket; which-Jewels he was carrying to the Prince of—, to show some of them to him; and the Prince own'd, that he had spoken to him to bring some such Jewels, to let him see them. But I sorely repented this Part afterward, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>This Rumour put an End to all Enquiry after his Jewels, his Ring, or his Watch; and as for the 700 Pistoles, that I secur'd: For the Bills which were in Hand, I own'd I had them; but that, as <HI>I said,</HI> I brought my Husband 30000 Livres Portion, I claim'd the said Bills, which came to not above 12000 Livres, for my <HI>Amende;</HI> and this, with the Plate, and the Hou∣shold-Stuff,
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>
was the principal of all his Estate which they could come at; as to the Foreign-Bill, which he was going to <HI>Versailles</HI> to get accepted, it was really lost with him; but his Manager, who had remitted the Bill to him, by Way of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> bringing over the second Bill, the Money was sav'd, as they call'd it, which would, otherwise, have been also gone; the Thieves who robb'd and murther'd him, were, to be sure, afraid to send any body to get the Bill accepted; for that would undoubtedly have discover'd them.</P>
<P>By this Time my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> was arriv'd, and she gave me an Account of her Management, and how she had secur'd every thing, and that she had quitted the House, and sent the Key to the Head-Manager of his Business; and let me know how much she had made of every Thing, very punctually and honestly.</P>
<P>I should have observ'd in the Account of his dwelling with me so long at—, that he never pass'd for any Thing there, but a Lodger in the House; and tho' he was Landlord, that did not alter the Case; so that at his Death, <HI>Amy</HI> coming to quit the House, and give them the Key, there was no Affinity between that, and the Case of their Master, who was newly kill'd.</P>
<P>I got good Advice at <HI>Paris,</HI> from an eminent Lawyer, a Counsellor of the Parliament there, and laying my Case before him, he directed me to make a Process in Dower upon the Estate, for making good my new Fortune upon Matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the Manager went back to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> well satisfied, that he had gotten the unaccepted Bills of Exchange, which was for 2500l. with some other things, which together, amounted to 17000 Li∣vies; and thus I got rid of him.</P>
<P>I was visited with great Civility on this sad Occasion, of the Loss of my Husband, as they thought him, by a great many Ladies of Quality; and the Prince of—, to whom it was reported he was carrying the Jewels, sent his Gentleman with a very handsome Com∣pliment of Condolance to me; and his Gentleman, whe∣ther with, or without Order, hinted, as if his Highness did intend to have visited me himself, but that some
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>
Accident, which he made a long Story of, had pre∣vented him.</P>
<P>By the Concourse of Ladies and others, that thus came to visit me, I began to be much known; and as I did not forget to set myself out with all possible Ad∣vantage, considering the Dress of a Widow, which in those Days was a most frightful Thing; I say, as I did thus from my own Vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very handsome; I say, on this Account, I was soon made very publick, and was known by the Name of <HI>La Belle veufeu de Poictou;</HI> or, the pretty Widow of <HI>Poictou:</HI> As I was very well pleased to see myself thus handsomely us'd in my Affliction, it soon dry'd up all my Tears; and tho' I appear'd as a Widow, yet, as we say in <HI>England,</HI> it was of a Widow comforted: I took Care to let the Ladies see, that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a Loss how to behave to any of them; and in short, I began to be very po∣pular there; but I had an Occasion afterwards, which made me decline that Kind of Management, as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>About four Days after I had receiv'd the Compli∣ments of Condolance from the Prince—, the same Gentleman he had sent before, came to tell me, that his Highness was coming to give me a Visit; I was indeed surpriz'd at that, and perfectly at a Loss how to behave: However, as there was no Remedy, I prepar'd to receive him as well as I cou'd; it was not many Minutes after, but he was at the Door, and came in, introduc'd by his own Gentleman, as above, and after by my Woman <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of Civility, and con∣dol'd handsomely the Loss of my Husband, and like∣wise the Manner of it; he told me, he understood he was coming to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to himself, to shew him some Jewels; that it was true, that he had discours'd with him about Jewels, but could not imagine how any Villains shou'd hear of his coming at that Time with them; that he had not order'd him to attend with them at <HI>Versailles,</HI> but told him, that he would come to <HI>Paris</HI> by such a Day, so that he was no Way accessary to
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>
the Disaster: I told him gravely, I knew very well that all his Highness had said of that Part, was true; that these Villains knew his Profession, and knew, no doubt, that he always carry'd a Casket of Jewels about him, and that he always wore a diamond Ring on his finger, worth a hundred Pistoles, which Report had magnified to five Hundred; and that if he had been going to any other Place, it wou'd have been the same Thing: After this, his Highness rose up to go, and told me, he had resolv'd however, to make me some Reparation; and with these Words put a silk Purse in∣to my Hand, with a hundred Pistoles, and told me, he would make me a farther Compliment of a small Pen∣sion, which his Gentleman would inform me of.</P>
<P>You may be sure I behav'd with a due Sense of so much Goodness, and offer'd to kneel to kiss his Hand, but he took me up, and saluted me, and sat down a∣gain, <HI>(tho' before, he made as if he was going away,)</HI> making me sit down by him.</P>
<P>He then began to talk with me more familiarly; told me, he hop'd I was not left in bad Circumstances; that Mr.—was reputed to be very rich, and that he had gain'd lately great Sums by some Jewels; and he hop'd, <HI>he said,</HI> that I had still a Fortune agreeable to the Condition I had liv'd in before.</P>
<P>I reply'd, with some Tears, which, I confess, were a little forc'd, that I believ'd if Mr.—had liv'd, we shou'd have been out of Danger of Want; but that it was impossible to estimate the Loss which I had sus∣tain'd, besides that of the Life of my Husband; that by the Opinion of those that knew something of his Affairs, and of what Value the Jewels were which he intended to have shown to <HI>his Highness,</HI> he could not have less about him, than the Value of a hundred Thousand Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es; that it was a fatal Blow to me, and to his whole Fa∣mily, especially that they should be lost in such a Manner.</P>
<P>His Highness return'd, with an Air of Concern, that he was very sorry for it; but he hop'd, if I settled in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aris,</HI> I might find Ways to restore my Fortune; at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me Time he complimented me, upon my being very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andsome, <HI>as he was pleased to call it,</HI> and that I could
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>
not fail of Admirers: I stood up, and humbly thank'd <HI>his Highness,</HI> but told him I had no Expectations of that Kind; that I thought I should be oblig'd to go over to <HI>England,</HI> to look after my Husband's Effects there, which I was told, were considerable; but that I did not know what Justice a poor Stranger wou'd get among them; and as for <HI>Paris,</HI> my Fortune being so impass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. I saw nothing before me, but to go back to <HI>Poicton,</HI> to my Friends, where some of my Relations, I hop'd, might do something for me, and added, that one of my Brothers was an <HI>Abbot</HI> at—, near <HI>Poictiers.</HI></P>
<P>He stood up, and taking me by the Hand, led me to a large Looking Glass, which made up the Pen i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Front of the Parlour; Look there, Madam, <HI>said</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Is it fit that Face (pointing to my Figure in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should go back to <HI>Poictou?</HI> No, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> say, and make some Gentleman of Quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all your Sorrows; and with that, he took me in his Arms, and kissing me twice, told me, he wou'd see me again, but with less Ceremony</P>
<P>Some little Time after this, but the same Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gentleman came to me again, and with great Ceremo∣ny and Respect, deliver'd me a black Box ty'd with a scarlet Ribband, and seal'd with a noble Coat of Arms, which, I suppose, was the Prince's; there was in it a Grant from his Highness, or an Assignment, I know not which to call it, with a Warrant to his Banker to pay me two Thousand Livres a Year, during my Stay in <HI>Paris,</HI> as the Widow of Monsieur—the Jeweller, mentioning the horrid Murther of my late Husband, as the Occasion of it, as above.</P>
<P>I receiv'd it with great Submission, and Expressions of being infinitely oblig'd to his Master, and of my showing myself on all Occasions, <HI>his Highness</HI>'s most obedient Servant; and after giving my most humble Duty to <HI>his Highness,</HI> with the utmost Acknowledgments of the Ob¦ligation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I went to a little Cabinet, and taking out some Money, which made a little Sound in taking it cut, offer'd to give him five Pistoles.</P>
<P>He drew back, but with the greatest Respect, and told me, he humbly thank'd me, but that he durst not
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>
take a Farthing; that <HI>his Highness</HI> wou'd take it so ill of him, he was sure, he would never see his Face more; but that he wou'd not fail to acquaint his Highness what Respect I had offer'd; and added, I assure you, Ma∣dam, you are more in the good Graces of my Ma∣ster, the Prince of—, than you are aware of; and I believe you will hear more of him.</P>
<P>Now I began to understand him, and resolv'd, if his Highness did come again, he should see me under no Disadvantages, if I could help it: I told him, if <HI>his Highness</HI> did me the Honour to see me again, I hop'd he would not let me be so surpriz'd as I was before; that I would be glad to have some little Notice of it, and would be oblig'd to him, if he would procure it me; he told me, he was very sure, that when <HI>his Highness</HI> intended to visit me, he should be sent before, to give me Notice of it; and that he would give me as much Warning of it, as possible.</P>
<P>He came several Times after this, on the same Er∣rand, that is, about the Settlement, the Grant, requir∣ing several Things yet to be done, for making it paya∣ble, without going every Time to the Prince again for a fresh Warrant; the Particulars of this Part I did not un∣derstand; but as soon as it was finish'd, which was above two Months, the Gentleman came one Afternoon, and said, <HI>his Highness</HI> design'd to visit me in the Evening; but desir'd to be admitted without Ceremony.</P>
<P>I prepar'd not my Rooms only, but myself; and when he came in, there was no-body appear'd in the House but his Gentleman, and my Maid <HI>Amy;</HI> and of her I bid the Gentleman acquaint <HI>his Highness,</HI> that she was an <HI>English</HI> Woman; that she did not understand a Word of <HI>French,</HI> and that she was one also that might be trusted.</P>
<P>When he came into my Room, I fell down at his Feet, before he could come to salute me, and with Words that I had prepar'd, full of Duty and Respect, thank'd him for his Bounty and Goodness to a poor desolate Wo∣man, oppress'd under the Weight of so terrible a Disaster, and refus'd to rise till he would allow me the Honour to kiss his Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="66"/>
<HI>Levez vous donc,</HI> says the Prince, taking me in his Arms, I design more Favours for you, than this Trifle; and going on, he added, you shall, for the Future, find a Friend where you did not look for it; and I resolve to let you see how kind I can be to one who is to me the most agreeable Creature on Earth.</P>
<P>I was dress'd in a kind of half-Mourning, had turn'd off my Weeds, and my Head, <HI>tho' I had yet no Rib∣bands or Lace,</HI> was so dress'd, as fail'd not to set me out with Advantage enough, for I began to understand his Meaning; and the Prince profess'd, I was the most beau∣tiful Creature on Earth; <HI>and where have I liv'd?</HI> says he; <HI>and how ill have I been serv'd that I should never, till now, be shew'd the finest Woman in</HI> France?</P>
<P>This was the Way, in all the World, the most likely to break in upon my Virtue, if I had been Mistress of any, for I was now become the vainest Creature upon Earth, and particularly, of my Beauty; which, as other People admir'd, so I became every Day more foolishly in Love with myself than before.</P>
<P>He said some very kind Things to me after this, and sat down with me, for an Hour, or more; when get∣ting-up, and calling his Gentleman, by his Name, he threw open the Door, <HI>Au Boir, says he;</HI> upon which, his Gentleman immediately brought up a little Table, cover'd with a fine damask Cloth, the Table no bigger than he cou'd bring in his two Hands; but upon it, was set two Decanters, one of Champaign, and the other of Water, six silver Plates, and a Service of fine Sweet-Meats in fine <HI>China</HI> Dishes, on a Sett of Rings standing up about twenty Inches high, one above another; below, was three roasted Partriges, and a Quail; as soon as his Gentleman had set it all down, he order'd him to with∣draw; now, <HI>says the Prince,</HI> I intend to sup with you.</P>
<P>When he sent away his Gentleman, I stood up and of∣fer'd to wait on his Highness while he eat, but he posi∣tively refused, and told me no, to-morrow you shall be the Widow of Monsieur—, the Jeweller, but to Night you shall be my Mistress; therefore sit here, <HI>says he,</HI> and eat with me, or I will get up and serve.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67"/>
I would then have call'd up my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> but I thought that would not be proper neither; so I made my Excuse, that since his Highness would not let his own Servant wait, I would not presume to let my Woman come up; but if he would please to let me wait, it would be my Honour to fill his Highness's Wine; but, as before, he would by no Means allow me; so we sat and eat together.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, <HI>says the Prince,</HI> give me Leave to lay aside my Character; let us talk together with the Freedom of Equals; my Quality sets me at a Distance from you, and makes you ceremonious; your Beauty ex∣alts you to more than an Equality, I must then treat you as Lovers do their Mistresses, but I cannot speak the Language; 'tis enough to tell you how agreeable you are to me; how I am surprized at your Beauty, and re∣solve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.</P>
<P>I knew not what to say to him a good while, but blush'd, and looking up towards him, said I was already made happy, in the Favour of a Person of such Rank; and had nothing to ask of his Highness, but that he would believe me infinitely obliged.</P>
<P>After he had eaten, he pour'd the Sweet-meats into my Lap; and the Wine being out, he called his Gentle∣man again to take away the Table, who, at first, only took the Cloth and the Remains of what was to eat, a∣way; and laying another Cloth set the Table on one Side of the Room, with a noble Service of Plate upon it, worth, at least, 200 Pistoles; then having set the two Decanters again upon the Table, fill'd, as before, he withdrew, for I found the Fellow understood his Bu∣siness very well, and his Lord's Business too.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after, the Prince told me, that I offer'd to wait a little before; that if I would now take <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Trouble, he would give me leave to give him some Wine; so I went to the Table, filled a Glass of Wine, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd brought it to him on a fine Salver, which the Glasses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tood on, and brought the Bottle or Decanter for Water <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n my other Hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He smiled, and bid me look on that Salver, which I lid, and admir'd it much, for it was a very fine one in∣deed:
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>
You may see, <HI>says he,</HI> I resolve to have more of your Company, for my Servant shall leave you that Plate for my Use: I told him, I believed his Highness would not take it ill, that I was not furnished fit to en∣tertain a Person of his Rank; and that I would take great Care of it, and value myself infinitely upon the Honour of his Highness's Visit.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take No∣tice of it; but, <HI>says he,</HI> I cannot leave you; have you not a spare Lodging for one Night? I told him I had but a homely Lodging to entertain such a Guest; he said something exceeding kind on that Head, but not sit to repeat; adding, that my Company would make him amends.</P>
<P>About Midnight he sent his Gentleman of an Errand, after telling him aloud that he intended to stay here all Night; in a little Time his Gentleman brought him a Night-gown, Slippers, two Caps, a Neck-cloth and Shirt, which he gave me to carry into his Chamber, and sent his Man Home; and then turning to me, said, I should do him the Honour to be his Chamberlain of the Houshold, and his Dresser also. I smiled, and told him I would do myself the Honour to wait on him upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>About One in the Morning, while his Gentleman was yet with him, I begg'd Leave to withdraw, sup∣posing he would go to Bed; but he took the Hint, and said I am not going to Bed yet; pray let me see you a∣gain.</P>
<P>I took this Time to undress me, and to come in a new Dress, which was, in a Manner, <HI>une Dishabile,</HI> but so fine, and all about me so clean and so agreeable, that he seemed surprised: I thought, <HI>says he,</HI> you could not have dress'd to more Advantage than you had done before; but now, <HI>says he,</HI> you charm me a thousand times more, if that be possible.</P>
<P>It is only a loose Habit, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> that I may the better wait on your Highness; he pulls me to him; you are perfectly obliging, <HI>says he,</HI> and sitting on the Bed-side, <HI>says he,</HI> Now you shall be a Princess, and know what it is to oblige the gratefullest Man alive;
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>
and with that, he took me in his Arms,—I can go no other in the Particulars of what passed at that Time; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended in this, in short, I lay with him all Night.</P>
<P>I have given you the whole Detail of this Story, to by it down as a black Scheme of the Way, how un∣happy Women are ruined by great Men; for, tho' Po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erty and Want is an irresistible Temptation to the Poor, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anity and great Things are as irresistible to others; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be courted by a Prince, and by a Prince who was first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Benefactor, then an Admirer; to be called handsome, he sinest Woman in <HI>France,</HI> and to be treated as a Wo∣man sit for the Bed of a Prince; these are Things, a Woman must have no Vanity in her, nay, no Corrupti∣on in her, that is not overcome by it; and my Case <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as such, that, as before, I had enough of both.</P>

<P>I had the same Particular to insist upon here with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rince, that I had with my Gentleman before; I hesi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted much at consenting, at first asking; but the Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld me, Princes did not court like other Men; that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey brought more powerful Arguments, and he very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettily added that they were sooner repulsed than other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and ought to be sooner complyed with; intimat∣ing, tho' very genteely, that after a Woman had posi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely refused him once, he could not, like other Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ait with Importunities and Stratagems, and laying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Sieges; but as such Men as he stormed warmly, so, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repulsed, they made no second Attacks; and indeed, was but reasonable; for as it was below their Rank <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be long battering a Woman's Constancy, so they ran eater Hazards in being exposed in their Amours, than her Men did.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="70"/>
I took this for a satisfactory Answer, and told to Highness, that I had the same Thoughts, in Respect to the Manner of his Attacks, for that his Person and his Arguments were irresistible; that a Person of his Rank, and a Munificence so unbounded, could not be with∣stood; that no Virtue was Proof against him, except such as was able too to suffer Martyrdom; that I thought it impossible I could be overcome, but that now I found it was impossible I should not be overcome; that it much Goodness, join'd with so much Greatness, would have conquer'd a Saint; and that I confess'd he had the Victory over me, by a Merit infinitely superior to the Conquest he had made.</P>
<P>He made me a most obliging Answer; told me A∣bundance of fine Things, which still flattered my Va∣nity, till at last I began to have Pride enough to believe him, and fancy'd myself a fit Mistress for a Prince.</P>
<P>As I had thus given the Prince the last Favour, and he had all the Freedom with me that it was possible for me to grant, so he gave me Leave to use as much Free∣dom with him another Way, and that was to have ever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thing of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask of him with an Air of Avarice, as if I was greedily making a Penny of him; but I manag'd him with such Art, that he generally anticipated my De∣mands; he only requested of me that I would not thank of taking another House, as I had intimated to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Highness that I had intended, not thinking it good e∣nough to receive his Visits in; but he said my Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was the most convenient that could possibly be sound a all <HI>Paris</HI> for an Amour, especially for him; having a Way out into three Streets, and not overlook'd by any Neighbours, so that he could pass and repass without Ob∣servation; for one of the Back-ways opened into a nar∣row dark Alley, which Alley was a Thorough-fate, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Passage out of one Street into another; and any Person that went in or out by the Door had no more to do but to see that there was nobody following him in the Alley, before he went in at the Door: This Request I know was reasonable, and therefore I assur'd him I would not
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>
change my Dwelling, seeing his Highness did not think it too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He also desired me that I would not take any more Servants, or set up any Equipage, at least, for the pre∣sent; for that it would then be immediately concluded I had been left very rich, and then I should be thronged with the Impertinence of Admirers, who would be at∣tracted by the Money as well as by the Beauty of a young Widow, and he should be frequently interrupted in his Visits; or that the World would conclude I was maintained by somebody, and would be indesatigable to find out the Person; so that he should have Spies peep∣ing at him, every Time he went out or in, which it would be impossible to disappoint; and that he should presently have it talked over all the Toilets in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Prince de—had got the Jeweller's Widow for a Mistress.</P>
<P>This was too just to oppose; and I made no Scruple to tell his Highness, that since he had stoop'd so low as to make me his own, he ought to have all the Satisfac∣tion in the World, that I was all his own; that I would take all the Measures he should please to direct me, to avoid the impertinent Attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be wholly within Doors, and have it given out, that I was obliged to go to <HI>England</HI> to sol∣licite my Affairs there, after my Husband's Misfortune; and that I was not expected there again for at least a Year or two: This he lik'd very well; only, <HI>he said,</HI> that he would by no Means have me confin'd; that it would injure my Health; and that I should then take a Country-house in some Village, a good Way off from the City, where it should not be known who I was; and that I should be there sometimes to divert me.</P>
<P>I made no Scruple of the Confinement, and told his Highness no Place could be a Confinement, where I had such a Visitor; and so I put off the Country-house, which would have been to remove myself farther from him, and have less of his Company; so I made the House be, as it were, shut up; <HI>Amy</HI> indeed appeared; and when any of the Neighbours and Servants enquir'd, he answered in broken <HI>French,</HI> that I was gone to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>
to look after my Affairs; which presently went current thro' the Streets about us: For, you are to note, that the People of <HI>Paris,</HI> especially the Women, are the most busy and impertinent Enquirers into the Conduct of their Neighbours, especially that of a single Woman, that are in the World; tho' there are no greater Intriguers in the Universe then themselves; and perhaps that may be the Reason of it; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an old, but a sure Rule; that</P>
<Q><L><HI>When deep Intrigues are close and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The</HI> GUILTY <HI>are the first that spy.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Thus his Highness had the most easy, and yet the most undiscoverable Access to me imaginable, and he seldom fail'd to come two or three Nights in a Week, and sometimes stay'd two or three Nights together: Once he told me, he was resolv'd I should be weary of his Company, and that he would learn to know what it was to be a Prisoner; so he gave out among his Ser∣vants, that he was gone to—, where he often went a Hunting, and that he should not return under a For∣night; and that Fortnight he stay'd wholly with me, and never went out of my Doors.</P>
<P>Never Woman, in such a Station, liv'd a Fortnight in so compleat a Fullness of human Delight; for to have the entire Possession of one of the most accomplish'd Princes in the World, and of the politest, best bred Man; to converse with him all Day, and, as he pro∣fess'd, charm him all Night; what could be more in∣expressibly pleasing, and especially, to a Woman of a vast deal of Pride, as I was?</P>
<P>To finish the Felicity of this Part, I must not forget, that the Devil had play'd a new Game with me, and prevail'd with me to satisfy myself with this Amour, as a lawful Thing; that a Prince of such Grandear, and Majesty; so infinitely superior to me; and one who had made such an Introduction by an unparallel'd Boun∣ty, I could not resist; and therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that Time perfectly
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>
single, and uningaged to any other Man: as I was, most certainly, by the unaccountable Absence of my first Husband, and the Murther of my Gentleman, who went for my second.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that I was the easier to perswade myself of the Truth of such a Doctrine as this, when it was so much for my Ease, and for the Repose of my Mind, to have it be so.</P>
<Q><L>In Things we wish 'tis easy to deceive;</L>
<L>What we would have, we willingly believe.</L></Q>
<P>Besides, I had no Casuists to resolve this Doubt; the same Devil that put this in o my Head, bade me go to any of the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy, and under the Pretence of Confession, state the Case exactly, and I should see they would either resolve it to be no Sin at all, or ab∣solve me upon the easiest Pennance: This I had a strong Inclination to try, but I know not what Scruple put me off of it, for I could never bring myself to like having to do with those Priests; and tho' it was strange that I, who had thus prostituted my Chastity, and gi∣ven up all Sense of Virtue, in two such particular Cases, living a Life of open Adultery, should scruple any Thing; yet so it was, I argued with myself, that I could not be a Cheat in any Thing that was esteem'd sacred; that I cou'd not be of one Opinion, and then pretend myself to be of another; nor could I go to Con∣fession, who knew nothing of the Manner of it, and should betray myself to the Priest, to be a Hugonot, and then might come into Trouble; but, in short, tho' I was a Whore, yet I was a Protestant Whore, and could not act as if I was Popish, upon any Account whatsoever.</P>
<P>But, I say, I satisfy'd myself with the surprizing Occasion, that, as it was all irresistible, so it was all lawful; for that Heaven would not suffer us to be pu∣nished for that which it was not possible forms to avoid; and with these Absurdities I kept Conscience from gi∣ving me any considerable Disturbance in all this Mat∣ter;
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>
and I was as perfectly easy as to the Lawfulness of it, as if I had been marry'd to the Prince, and had had no other Husband: So possible it is for us to roll our∣selves up in Wickedness, till we grow invulnerable by Conscience; and that Centinel once doz'd, sleeps fast, not to be awakened while the Tide of Pleasure conti∣nues to flow, or till something dark and dreadful brings us to ourselves again.</P>
<P>I have, I confess, wonder'd at the Stupidity that my intellectual Part was under all that while; what lethargic Fumes doz'd the Soul; and how it was possi∣ble that I, who in the Case before, where the Tempta∣tion was many Ways more forcible, and the Arguments stronger, and more irresistible, was yet under a conti∣nued Inquietude on Account of the wicked Life I led, could now live in the most profound Tranquility, and with an uninterrupted Peace, nay, even rising up to Satisfaction, and Joy, and yet in a more palpable State of Adultery than before; for before, my Gentleman who call'd me Wife, had the Pretence of his Wife be∣ing parted from him, refusing to do the Duty of her Office as a Wife to him; as for me, my Circumstances were the same; but as for the Prince, as he had a fine and extraordinary Lady, or Princess, of his own; so he had had two or three Mistresse, more besides me, and made no Scruple of it at all.</P>
<P>However, I say, as to my own Part, I enjoy'd my∣self in perfect Tranquility; and as the Prince was the only Deity I worshipp'd, so I was really his Idol; and however it was with his Princess, I assure you, his other Mistresses found a sensible Difference; and though they could never find me out, yet I had good Intelligence, that they guess'd very well, that their Lord had got some new Favourite that robb'd them of his Company, and perhaps, of some of his usual Bounty too: And now I must mention the Sacrifices he made to his Idol, and they were not a few, I assure you.</P>
<P>As he lov'd like a Prince, so he rewarded like a Prince; for though he declin'd my making a Figure, as above, he let me see, that he was above doing it for
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>
the saving the Expence of it, and so he told me, and that he would make it up in other Things: First of all, he sent me a Toilet, with the Appurtenances of Silver, even so much as the Frame of the Table; and then, for the House, he gave me the Table, or Side board of Plate I mention'd above, with all Things belonging to it, of massy Silver; so that, in short, I could not, for my Life, study to ask him for any Thing of Plate which I had not.</P>
<P>He could then accommodate me in nothing more but Jewels and Cloaths, or Money for Cloaths; he sent his Gentleman to the Mercer's, and bought me a Suit, or whole Piece, of the finest brocaded Silk, figur'd with Gold, and another with Silver, and another of Crim∣son; so that I had three Suits of Cloaths, such as the Queen of <HI>France</HI> would not have disdain'd to have worn at that Time; yet I went out no-where; but as those were for me to put on, when I went out of Mourning, I dress'd myself in them, one after another, always when his Highness came to see me.</P>
<P>I had no less than five several Morning Dresses be∣sides these, so that I need never be seen twice in the same Dress; to these he added several Parcels of fine Linnen, and of Lace, so much, that I had no Room to ask for more, or indeed, for so much.</P>
<P>I took the Liberty once, in our Freedoms, to tell him, he was too bountiful, and that I was too charge∣able to him for a Mistress, and that I would be his faithful Servant, at less Expence to him; and that he not only left me no Room to ask him for any Thing, but that he supply'd me with such a Profusion of good Things, that I scarce could wear them, or use them; unless I kept a great Equipage, which he knew was no Way convenient for him, or for me; he smil'd, and took me in his Arms, and told me, he was resolv'd, while I was his, I should never be able to ask him for any Thing; but that he would be daily asking new Favours of me.</P>
<P>After we were up, for this Conference was in Bed, he desired I would dress me in the best Suit of Cloaths
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>
I had: It was a Day or two after the three Suits were made, and brought Home. I told him, if he pleas'd, I wou'd rather dress me in that Suit which I knew he lik'd best; he ask'd me, how I could know which he would like best, before he had seen them? I told him, I wou'd presume, for once, to guess at his Fancy by my own; so I went away, and dress'd me in the second Suit, brocaded with Silver, and return'd in full Dress, with a Suit of Lace upon my Head, which would have been worth in <HI>England,</HI> 200 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and I was every Way set out as well as <HI>Amy</HI> could dress me, who was a very genteel Dresser too: In this Figure I came to him, out of my Dressing-room, which open'd with Folding Doors into his Bed-chamber.</P>
<P>He sat as one astonished, a good while, looking at me, without speaking a Word, till I came quite up to him, kneel'd on one Knee to him, and almost whether he would or no, kiss'd his Hand; he took me up, and stood up himself, but was surpriz'd, when taking me in his Arms, he perceiv'd Tears to run down my Cheeks; My Dear, says he, aloud, what mean these Tears? My Lord, said I, after some little Check, for I cou'd not speak presently, I beseech you to believe me, they are not Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Joy; it is impossible for me to see myself snatch'd from the Misery I was fallen into, and at once to be in the Arms of a Prince of such Goodness, such immense Bounty, and be treated in such a Manner; 'tis not possible, my Lord, said I, to contain the Satisfaction of it; and it will break out in an Excess in some Measure propor∣tion'd to your immense Bounty, and to the Affection which your Highness treats me with, who am so infi∣nitely below you.</P>
<P>It wou'd look a little too much like a Romance here, to repeat all the kind Things he said to me, on that Occasion; but I can't omit one Passage; as he saw the Tears drop down my Cheek, he pulls out a fine Cam∣brick Handkerchief, and was going to wipe the Tears off, but check'd his Hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he check'd his Hand, and toss'd the
<PB N="79" REF="77"/>
Handkerchief to me, to do it myself; I took the Hint immediatly, and with a kind of Disdain, <HI>How, my Lord!</HI> said I, <HI>Have you kiss'd me so often, and don't you know whether I am painted, or not? Pray let your Highness satisfy yourself, that you have no Cheats put upon you; for once let me be vain enough to say, I have not deceiv'd you with false Colours:</HI> With this, I put a Handkerchief into his Hand, and taking his Hand into mine, I made him wipe my Face so hard, that he was unwilling to do it, for fear of hurting me.</P>
<P>He appear'd surpriz'd, more than ever, and swore, which was the first Time that I had heard him swear, from my first knowing him, that he cou'd not have believed there was any such Skin, without Paint, in the World: <HI>Well, my Lord,</HI> said I, <HI>your Highness shall have a farther Demonstration than this; as to that which you are pleas'd to accept for Beauty, that it is the meer Work of Nature;</HI> and with that I stept to the Door, and rung a little Bell, for my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> and bace her bring me a Cup-full of hot Water, which she did; and when it was come, I desir'd his Highness to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if it was warm; which he did, and I immediately wash'd my Face all over with it, before him; this was, indeed, more than Satisfaction, that is to say, than believing, for it was an undeniable Demonstration, and he ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d my Cheeks and Breasts a thousand Times, with Ex∣pressions of the greatest Surprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I a very indifferent Figure as to Shape; tho' I had two-Children by my Gentleman, and fix by my true Husband, I say I was no de pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Shape; and my Prince (I must be allowed the Vanity to call him so) was taking his View of me as I walked from one End of the Room to the other; at last he leads me to the darkest Part of the Room, and standing behind me bid me hold up my Head, when putting both his Hands round my Neck, as if he was spanning my Neck, to see how small it was, for it was long and small; he held my Neck so long and so hard in his Hand that I complained he hurt me a little; what he did it for, I knew not, nor had I the least Suspicion
<PB N="80" REF="78"/>
but that he was spanning my Neck; but when I said he hurt me, he seemed to let go, and in half a Minute more, led me to a Peir Glas, and behold. I saw my Neck clasp'd with a fine Necklace of Diamonds; where∣as I felt no more what he was doing, than if he had re∣ally done nothing at all, nor did I suspect it in the least: If I had an Ounce of Blood in me that did not fly up into my Face, Neck and Breasts, it must be from some Interruption in the Vessels; I was all on Fire with the Sight, and began to wonder what it was that was com∣ing to me.</P>
<P>However to let him see that I was not unqualified to receive Benefits; I turn'd about, my Lord, <HI>says I,</HI> your Highness is resolved to conquer by your Bounty, the ve∣ry Gratitude of your Servants; you will leave no Room for any Thing but Thanks, and make those Thanks useless too, by their bearing no Proportion to the Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>I love, Child, <HI>says he,</HI> to see every Thing suitable; a fine Gown and Petticoat; a fine lac'd Head; a fine Face and Neck and no Necklace, would not have made the Object perfect: But why that Blush, my Dear, <HI>says the Prince?</HI> My Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> all your Gifts call for Blushes; but above all, I blush to receive what I am so ill a le to merit, and may become so ill also.</P>
<P>Thus far I am a standing Mark of the Weakness of great Men in their Vice, that value not squandring a∣way immense Wealth upon the most worthless Crea∣tures; or to sum it up in a Word, they raise the Value of the Object they pretend to pitch upon by their Fan∣cy; I say, raise the Value of it at their own Expence; give vast Presents for a ruinous Favour, which is so far from being equal to the Price, that nothing will, at last, prove more absurd than the Cost Men are at to purchase their own Destruction.</P>
<P>I could not, in the Height of all this fine Doings, I say, I could not be without some just Reflection, tho' Conscience was, as I said, dumb as to any Disturbance it gave me in my Wickedness; my Vanity was fed up to such a Height, that I had no Room to give Way to such Reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="79"/>
But I could not but sometimes look back, with Asto∣nishment, at the Folly of Men of Quality, who im∣mense in their Bounty, as in their Wealth, give to a Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fusion and without Bounds, to the most scandalous of o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sex for g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nting them the Liberty of abusing them∣elves, and running both.</P>
<P>I, that knew what this Carcass of mine had been but a few Years before; how overwhelmed with Grief, drowned in Tears, frighted with the Prospect of Beg∣gary, and surrounded with Rags, and fatherless chil∣dren, that was pawning and selling the Rags that co∣vered me, for a Dinner, and sat on the Ground de pair∣ing of Help, and expecting to be starved, till my Chil∣dren were snatch'd from me, to be kept by the Parish; I, that was after this, a Whore for Bread, and abandoning Conscience and Virtue, lived with another Woman's Husband; I, that was depised by all my Relations, and my Husbands too; I, that was left so entirely desolate, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>endless and helpless, that I knew not how to get the least Help to keep me from starving; that I should be caress'd by a Prince, for the Honour of having the scan∣dulous Use of my prostituted Body, common before to his Inferiors, and perhaps would not have denied one of his Footmen but a little while before, if I could have got my Bread by it.</P>
<P>I say, I could not but reflect upon the Brutality and Blindness of Mankind; that because Nature had given me a good Skin, and some agreeable Features, should suffer that Beauty to be such a Bait to Appetite, as to do such fordid unaccountable Things, to obtain the Posses∣sion of it.</P>
<P>It is for this Reason, that I have so largely set down the Particulars of the Caresses I was treated with by the Jeweller, and also by this Prince; not to make the Sto∣ry an incentive to the Vice, which I am now such a sor∣rowful Penitent for being guilty of, <HI>God forbid any should make so vile a Use of so good a Design,</HI> but to draw the just Picture of a Man enslav'd to the Rage of his vi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Appetite; how he defaces the Image of God in his Soul; dethrones his Reason, causes Conscience to
<PB N="82" REF="80"/>
abdicate the Possession, and exalts Sense into the vacant Throne; how he deposes the Man, and exalts the Brute.</P>
<P>O! could we hear now the Reproaches this great Man afterwards loaded himself with, when he grew weary of this admir'd Creature, and became sick of his Vice! how profitable would the Report of them be to the Reader of this Story; but had he himself also known the dirty History of my Actings upon the Stage of Life, that little Time I had been in the World, how much more severe would those Reproaches have been upon him∣self; but I shall come to this again.</P>
<P>I lived in this gay Sort of Retirement almost three Years, in which Time, no Amour of such a kind, sure, was ever carry'd up so high; the Prince knew no Bounds to his Munificence; he could give me nothing, either for my wearing or using, or eating or drinking, more than he had done from the Begininng.</P>
<P>His Presents were, after that, in Gold, and very fre∣quent and large; often an hundred Pastoles, never less than fifty at a Time; and I must do myself the Justice, that I seemed rather backward to receive, than craving and encroaching; not that I had not an avaricious Tem∣per; nor was it that I did not foresee that this was my Harvest, in which I was to gather up, and that it would not last long; but it was, that really his Bounty always anticipated my Expectations, and even my Wishes; and he gave me Money so fast, that he rather poured it in upon me than left me Room to ask it; so that before I could spend fifty Pistoles, I had always an hundred to make it up.</P>
<P>After I had been near a Year and half in his Arms, as above, or thereabouts, I proved with Child; I did not take any Notice of it to him, till I was satisfy'd that I was not deceived; when one Morning early, when we were in Bed together, I said to him, my Lord, I doubt your Highness never gives yourself Leave to think what the Case should be, if I should have the Honour to be with Child by you: Why, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> we are able to keep it if such a Thing should happen; I hope you are not concern'd about that: No, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> I should think myself very happy, if I could bring
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>
your Highness a Son, I should hope to see him a Lieute∣nant-General of the King's Armies, by the Interest of his Father, and by his own Merit.</P>
<P>Assure yourself, Child, <HI>says he,</HI> if it should be so, I will not refuse owning him for my Son, tho' it be, as they call it, a natural Son; and shall never slight or neglect him for the Sake of his Mother: Then he be∣gan to importune me to know if it was so; but I posi∣tively denied it so long, till at last, I was able to give him the Satisfaction of knowing it himself, by the Mo∣tion of the Child within me.</P>
<P>He profess'd himself overjoyed at the Discovery, but told me that now it was absolutely necessary for me to quit the Confinement, which, <HI>he said,</HI> I had suffered for his Sake, and to take a House somewhere in the Country, in Order for Health, as well as for Privacy, against my Lying-in: This was quite out of my Way; but the Prince, who was a Man of Pleasure, had, it seems, several Retreats of this Kind, which he had made Use of, I suppose, upon like Occasions; and so leaving it, as it were, to his Gentleman, he provided a very convenient House, about four Miles South of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> at the Village of—, where I had very a∣greeable Lodgings, good Gardens, and all Things very easy to my Content; but one Thing did not please me at all, <HI>viz.</HI> that an old Woman was provided, and put into the House to furnish every Thing necessary to my Lying-in, and to assist at my Travel.</P>
<P>I did not like this old Woman at all; she look'd so like a Spy upon me, or (as sometimes I was frighted to imagine) like one set privately to dispatch me out of the World, as might best suit with the Circumstance of my Lying-in; and when his Highness came the next Time to see me, which was not many Days, I expostu∣ated a little on the Subject of the old Woman; and by the Management of my Tongue, as well as by the Strength of Reasoning, I convinced him that it would not be at all convenient; that it would be the greater Risque on his Side; and that first or last it would cer∣tainly expose him, and me also; I assured him that my

Servant being an <HI>English</HI> Woman, never knew, to that Hour, who his Highness was; that I always call'd him the <HI>Count de Clerac;</HI> and that she knew nothing else of him, nor ever should; that if he would give me leave to choose proper Persons for my Use, it should be so order'd, that not one of them should know who he was, or perhaps, over see his Face; and that for the Reali∣ty of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ild that should be born, his Highness, who had alone been at the first of it, should, if he pleas'd, be present in the Room all the Time; so that he wou'd need no Witnesses on that Account.</P>
<P>This Discourse fully satisfy'd him, so that he or∣der'd his Gentleman to dismiss the old Woman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same Day; and without any Difficulty, I sent my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dover,</HI> where she got an <HI>English</HI> Midwife, and an <HI>English</HI> Nurse, to come over on Purpose to attend an <HI>English</HI> Lady of Quality, as they stil'd me, for four Months certain: The Mid∣wise, <HI>Amy</HI> had agreed to pay a hundred Guineas to, and bear her Charges to <HI>Paris,</HI> and back again to <HI>De∣ver;</HI> the poor Woman that was to be my Nurse, had twenty Pounds, and the same Terms for Charges, as the other.</P>
<P>I was very easy when <HI>Amy</HI> return'd, and the more, because she brought with the Midwise, a good Mother∣ly Sort of Woman, who was to be her Assistant, and would be very helpful on Occasion; and bespoke a Man midwise at <HI>Paris</HI> too, if there should be any Ne∣cessity for his Help: Having thus made Provision for every Thing, the <HI>Count,</HI> for so we all call'd him in pub∣lic, came as often to see me as I could expect, and continued exceeding kind, as he had always been. One Day, conversing together, upon the Subject of my be∣ing with Child, I told him how all Things were in or∣der; but that I had a strange Apprehension that I should die with that Child: He smil'd, <HI>So all the Ladies say,</HI> my Dear, says he, <HI>when they are with Child.</HI> Well, however, my Lord, said I, it is but just, that Care shou'd be taken, that what you have bestow'd in your Excess of Bounty upon me, should not be lost; and
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>
upon this, I pull'd a Paper out of my Bosom, solded up, but not sealed, and read it to him: Wherein I had left Order, that all the Plate and Jewels, and fine Fur∣niture, which his Highness had given me, should be restor'd to him by my Woman, and the Keys be im∣mediately deliver'd to his Gentleman, in Case of Disaster.</P>
<P>Then I recommended my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> to his Fa∣vour for a hundred Pistoles, on Condition she gave the Keys up, as above, to his Gentleman, and his Gentleman's Receipt for them; when he saw this, <HI>My dear Child,</HI> said he, and took me in his Arms, <HI>What, have you been making your Will, and disposing your Ef∣fects? Pray who do you make your universal Heir?</HI> So far as to do Justice to your Highness, in Case of Mor∣tality, I have, my Lord, said I, and who should I dis∣pose the valuable Things to, which I have had from your Hand, as Pledges of your Favour, and Testimo∣nies of your Bounty, but to the Giver of them? If the Child should live, your Highness will, I don't question, act like yourself in that Part, and I shall have the ut∣most Satisfaction, that it will be well us'd by your Direction.</P>
<P>I cou'd see he took this very well: <HI>I have forsaken all the Ladies in</HI> Paris, says he, <HI>for you; and I have liv'd every Day since I knew you, to see that you know how to merit all that a Man of Honour can do for you; be easy, Child, I hope you shall not die, and all you have is your own, to do what with it you please.</HI></P>
<P>I was then within about two Months of my Time, and that soon wore off; when I found my Time was come, it fell out very happily, that he was in the House, and I entreated he would continue a few Hours in the House, which he agreed to; they call'd his Highness to come into the Room, if he pleas'd, as I had offer'd, and as I desir'd him, and I sent Word, I would make as few Cries as possible, to prevent disturb∣ing him; he came into the Room once, and call'd to me to be of good Courage, it wou'd soon be over, and then he withdrew again; and in about half an
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>
Hour more, <HI>Amy</HI> carried him the News, that I was deliver'd, and had brought him a charming Boy; he gave her ten Pistoles for her News, stay'd till they had adjusted Things about me, and then came into the Room again, chear'd me and spoke kindly to me, and look'd on the Child, then withdrew, and came again the next Day, to visit me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have look'd back upon these Things with Eyes unpossess'd with Crime, when the wicked Part has appeared in its clearer Light, and I have seen it in its own Colours; when no more blinded with the glittering Appearances, which at that Time deluded me, and, as in like Cases, if I may guess at others by myself, too much possess'd the Mind; I say, since this, I have often wonder'd, with what Pleasure, or Satisfaction, the Prince cou'd look upon the poor innocent Infant; which tho' his own, and that he might that Way have some Attachment in his Affec∣tions to it, yet must always afterwards be a Remem∣brancer to him of his most early Crime; and which was worse, must bear upon itself, unmerited, an eter∣nal Mark of Infamy, which should be spoken of, upon all Occasions, to its Reproach, from the Folly of its Father, and Wickedness of its Mother.</P>
<P>Great Men are, indeed, deliver'd from the Burthen of their Natural Children, or Bastards, as to their Maintenance: This is the main Affliction in other Ca∣ses, where there is not Substance sufficient, without breaking into the Fortunes of the Family; in those Cases, either a Man's legitimate Children suffer, which is very unnatural; or the unfortunate Mother of that illegitimate Birth, has a dreadful Affliction, either of being turn'd off with her Child, and be left to starve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or of seeing the poor Infant pack'd off with a Piece of Money, to some of those She-butchers, who take Children off of their Hands, as 'tis call'd; that is to say, starve them, and, in a Word, murder them.</P>
<P>Great Men, I say, are deliver'd from this Burthen, because they are always furnish'd to supply the Expence of their out-of-the-Way Off-spring, by making little
<PB N="87" REF="85"/>
Assignments upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons,</HI> or the Town-House of <HI>Paris,</HI> and settling those Sums, to be receiv'd for the Maintenance of such Expence as they see Cause.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Case of this Child of mine, while he and I convers'd, there was no need to make any Ap∣pointment, as an Appenage, or Maintenance for the Child, or its Nurse; for he supplied me more than suf∣ficiently for all those Things; but afterward, when Time, and a particular Circumstance, put an End to our con∣versing together; as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Things always meet with a Period, and generally break off abruptly; I say, after that, I found he appointed the Children a settled Al∣lowance, by an Assignment of annual Rent, upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which was sufficient for bringing them handsomely, tho' privately, up in the World; and that not in a Manner unworthy of their Father's Blood, tho' I came to be sunk and forgotten in the Case: nor did the Children ever know any thing of their Mother, to this Day, other than as you may have an Account hereafter.</P>
<P>But to look back to the particular Observation I was making, which I hope may be of Use to those who read my Story; I say, it was something wonderful to me, to see this Person so exceedingly delighted at the Birth of this Child, and so pleas'd with it; for he would sit and look at it, and with an Air of Seriousness sometimes, a great while together; and particularly, I observ'd, he lov'd to look at it when it was a sleep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely charming Child, and had a certain Vivacity in its Countenance, that is far from being common to all Children so young; and he would often say to me, that he believed there was something <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtraordinary in the Child, and he did not doubt but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would come to be a great Man.</P>
<P>I could never hear him say so, but tho' secretly it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas'd me, yet it so closely touch'd me another Way, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I could not refrain Sighing, and sometimes Tears; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd one Time, in particular, it so affected me, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not conceal it from him; but when he saw Tears <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n down my Face, there was no concealing the Occa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on from him; he was too importunate to be deny'd, a Thing of that Moment; so I frankly answer'd, it
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>
sensibly affects me, MY LORD, <HI>said I,</HI> that whatever the Merit of this little Creature may be, he must always have a Bend on his Arms; the Disaster of his Birth will be always, not a Blot only to his Honour, but a Bar to his Fortunes in the World; our Affection will be ever his Affliction, and his Mother's Crime be the Son's Re∣proach; the Blot can never be wip'd out by the most glorious Actions; nay, if it lives to raise a Family, <HI>said I,</HI> the Infamy must descend even to its innocent Po∣sterity.</P>
<P>He took the Thought, and sometimes told me after∣wards, that it made a deeper Impression on him, than he discover'd to me at that Time; but for the present, he put it off, with telling me, these Things could not be help'd; that they serv'd for a Spur to the Spirits of brave Men; inspir'd them with the Principles of Gal∣lantry, and prompted them to brave Actions; that tho' it might be true, that the Mention of Illegitimacy might attend the Name, yet that personal Virtue plac'd a Man of Honour above the Reproach of his Birth; that as he had no Share in the Offence, he would have no Concern at the Blot; when having by his own Merit plac'd himself out of the reach of Scandal, his Fame shou'd drown the Memory of his Beginning.</P>
<P>That as it was usual for Men of Quality to make such little Escapes, so the Number of their natural Chil∣dren were so great, and they generally took such good Care of their Education, that some of the greatest Men in the World had a Bend in their Coats of Arms, and that it was of no Consequence to them, especially when their Fame began to rise upon the Basis of their acquir'd Merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to me some of the greatest Families in <HI>France,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> also.</P>
<P>This carry'd off our Discourse for a Time; but I went farther with him once, removing the Discourse from the Part attending our Children, to the Reproach which those Children would be apt to throw upon us, their Originals; and when speaking a little too feeling∣ly on the Subject, he began to receive the Impression a little deeper than I wish'd he had done; at last he
<PB N="89" REF="87"/>
told me, I had almost acted the Confessor to him; that I might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous Doctrine to him than we shou'd either of us like, or than I was aw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of; for, <HI>my Dear, says he,</HI> if once we come to talk of Repentance, we must talk of parting.</P>
<P>If Tears were in my Eyes before, they flow'd too fast now to be retrain'd, and I gave him but too much Satisfaction by my Looks, that I had yet no Reflections upon my Mind, strong enough to go that Length, and that I could no more think of parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He said a great many kind Things, which were Great, like himself, and extenuating our Crime, in∣timated to me, that he cou'd no more part with me, than I cou'd with him; so we both, as I may say, even against our Light, and against our Conviction, concluded to SIN ON; indeed, his Affection to the Child was one great Tye to him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>This Child liv'd to be a considerable Man. He was first, an Officer of the Guard <HI>du Corps</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> and afterwards Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and on many extraordinary Occasions, shew'd that he was not unworthy such a Father, but many Ways de∣serving a legitimate Birth, and a better Mother: Of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I think I may say now, that I liv'd indeed like a Queen; or if you will have me confess, that my Con∣dition had still the Reproach of <HI>a Whore,</HI> I may say, I was sure, the Queen of Whores; for no Woman was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver more valued, or more caress'd by a Person of such Quality, only in the Station of a Mistress; I had, indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Desiciency, which Women in such Circumstances <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dom are chargeable with; namely. I crav'd nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him; I never ask'd him for any Thing in my Life; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or suffer'd myself to be made use of, as is too much the Custom of Mistresses, to ask Favours for others; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Bounty always prevented me in the first, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concealing myself, in the last; which was no less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my Convenience, than his.</P>
<P>The only Favour I ever ask'd of him, was, for his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entleman, whom he had all along intrusted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tiet of our Affair, and who had once so much of∣fended
<PB N="90" REF="88"/>
him, by some Omissions in his Duty, that he found it very hard to make his Peace; he came and laid his Case before my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> and begg'd her to speak to me, to interceed for him; which I did, and on my Account, he was receiv'd again, and pardon'd; for which, the grateful Dog requited me, by getting to Bed to his Benefactress <HI>Amy;</HI> at which I was very angry; but <HI>Amy</HI> generously acknowledg'd, that it was her Fault as much as his; that she lov'd the Fellow so much, that she believ'd, if he had not ask'd her, she should have ask'd him; I say, this pacify'd me, and I only obtain'd of her, that she should not let him know that I knew it.</P>
<P>I might have interspers'd this Part of my Story with a great many pleasant Parts, and Discourses, which hap∣pen'd between my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and I; but I omit them, on Account of my own Story, which has been so ex∣traordinary: However, I must mention something as to <HI>Amy</HI> and her Gentleman. I enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> upon what Terms they came to be so intimate; but <HI>Amy</HI> seem'd backward to explain herself; I did not care to press her upon a Question of that Nature, knowing that she might have answer'd my Question with a Question, and have said, Why, how did I and the Prince come to be so intimate? so I left off farther enquiring into it, till after some Time, she told it me all freely, of her own Accord, which, to cut it short, amounted to no more than this, that <HI>like</HI> Mistress, <HI>like</HI> Maid; as they had many leisure Hours together below, while they waited respectively, when his Lord and I were together above; I say, they could hardly avoid the usual Question out to another, namely, why might not they do the same Thing below, that we did above?</P>
<P>On that Account, indeed, as I said above, I could not find in my Heart to be angry with <HI>Amy;</HI> I was in∣deed afraid the Girl would have been with Child <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but that did not happen, and so there was no Hurt done; for <HI>Amy</HI> had been hansell'd before, as well as her Mi∣stress, and by the same Party too, as you have heard.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89"/>
After I was up again, and my Child provided with a good Nurse, and withal, Winter coming on, it was proper to think of coming to <HI>Paris</HI> again, which I did; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as I had now a Coach and Horses, and some Ser∣vants to attend me, by my Lord's Allowance, I took the Liberty to have them come to <HI>Paris</HI> sometimes, and so to take a Tour into the Garden of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> and the other pleasant Places of the City. It happen'd one Day, that my Prince (if I may call him so) had a Mind to give me some Diversion, and to take the Air with me; but that he might do it, and not be publickly known, he comes to me in a Coach of the Count <HI>de—,</HI> a great Officer of the Court, attended by his Liveries also; so that, in a Word, it was impossible to guess by the Equipage, who I was, or who I belong'd to; also, that I might be the more effectually conceal'd, he order'd me to be taken up at a Mantua-Maker's House, where he sometimes came, whether upon other Amours, or not, was no Business of mine to enquire: I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was in the Coach with me, he told me, he had order'd his Servants to go to court with me, and he would shew me some of the <HI>Beau Monde;</HI> I told him, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d not where I went, while I had the Honour to have him with me; so he carried me to the fine Palace of <HI>Meudon,</HI> where the <HI>Dauphine</HI> then was, and where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had some particular Intimacy with one of the <HI>Dau∣phine</HI>'s Domesticks, who procur'd a Retreat for me in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dgings, while we stay'd there; which was three or four Days.</P>
<P>While I was there, the KING happen'd to come thi∣ther from <HI>Versailles,</HI> and making but a short Stay, vi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Madam the <HI>Dauphiness,</HI> who was then living. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce was here <HI>Incognito,</HI> only because of his being with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and therefore, when he heard that the KING was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Gardens, he kept close within the Lodgings; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Gentleman, in whose Lodgings we were, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lady, and several others, went out to see the KING, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had the Honour to be ask'd to go with them.</P>
<P>After we had seen the KING, who did not stay long the Gardens, we walk'd up the broad Terrass, and
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>
crossing the Hall, towards the great Stair-Case, I had a Sight, which confounded me at once, as, I doubt not, it wou'd have done to any Woman in the World: The Horse-Guards, or what they call there the <HI>Gens d'arms,</HI> had upon some Occasion, been either upon Duty, or been review'd, or something (I did not understand that Part) was the Matter, that occasion'd their being there, I know not what; but walking in the Guard-Cham∣ber, and with his Jack-Boots on, and the whole Hab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Troop, as it is worn, when our Horse-Guards a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upon Duty, as they call it, at St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park;</HI> I say, there, to my inexpressible Confusion, I saw Mr.—, my first Husband, the Brewer.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be deceiv'd; I pass'd so near him, that I almost brush'd him with my Cloaths, and look'd him full in the Face; but having my Fan before my Face, so that he cou'd not know me; however, I knew him per∣fectly well, and I heard him speak, which was a second Way of knowing him; besides, <HI>being, you may be sur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> astonish'd and surpriz'd at such a Sight,</HI> I turn'd about after I had pass'd him some Steps, and pretending to ask the Lady that was with me, some Questions, I stood as if I had view'd the Great Hall, the outer Guard-Chamber, and some other Things: but I did it to take a full View of his Dress, that I might farther inform myself.</P>
<P>While I stood thus amusing the Lady that was wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me with Questions, he walk'd, talking with another Man of the same Cloth, back again, just by me; and to my particular Satisfaction, or Dissatisfaction, take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which Way you will, I heard him speak <HI>English,</HI> the other being, it seems, an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P>I then ask'd the Lady some other Questions: Pray, Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> what are these Troopers here? are they the KING's Guards? No, <HI>says she,</HI> they are the <HI>Gens d'arms;</HI> a small Detachment of them, I suppose, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tended the KING to-Day, but they are not his Ma¦jesty's ordinary Guard; another Lady that was with he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, No, Madam, it seems that is not the Case; for heard them saying the <HI>Gens d'arms</HI> were here to Day by special Order, some of them being to march towards the
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
<HI>hine,</HI> and these attend for Orders; but they go back to-morrow to <HI>Orlcans,</HI> where they are expected.</P>
<P>This satisfied me in Part, but I sound Means after his, to enquire, whose particular Troop it was that the Gentlemen that were here, belong'd to; and with that, heard, they would all be at <HI>Paris</HI> the Week after.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, we return'd for <HI>Paris,</HI> when I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook Occasion to speak to my Lord, that I heard the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n. d'arms</HI> were to be in the City the next Week, and that I should be charm'd with seeing them march, if they came in a Body: He was so obliging in such Things, that I need but just name a Thing of that Kind, and it was done; so he order'd his Gentleman (I shou'd now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all him <HI>Amy</HI>'s <HI>Gentleman)</HI> to get me a Place in a cer∣tain House, where I might see them march.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy,</HI> I have heard enough so far; what did she do afterwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amy</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot give you any farther Account, Sir; my Mistress would not let me stay with her any longer; she did she could neither pay me or subsist me. I told her, I would serve her without any Wages, but I could not live without Victuals, you know: so I was forced to leave her, <HI>poor Lady,</HI> sore against my Will, and I heard afterwards, that the Landlord seized her Goods, so she was, I suppose, turned out of Doors; for as I went by the Door, about a Month after, I saw the House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up; and about a Fortnight after that, I found there were Workmen at work, fitting it up, as I suppose, for a new Tennant; but none of the Neighbours could tell me what was become of my poor Mistress, only that they said she was so poor, that it was next to begging; that some of the neighbouring Gentle-Folks had reliev∣ed her, or that else she must have starved; then she went on, and told him, that after that, they never heard any more of <HI>[me]</HI> her Mistress; but that she had been se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> once or twice in the City, very shabby, and poor it Cloaths, and it was thought she work'd with her Needs for her Bread. All this the Jade said with so much Cu∣ning, and managed and humour'd it so well, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her Eyes, and cry'd so artificially, that he took it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was intended he should, and once or twice she sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tears in his Eyes too: He told her it was a moving me¦lancholly Story, and it had almost broke his Heart a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first; but that he was driven to the last Extremity, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could do nothing, but stay and see 'em all starve, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

he could not bear the Thoughts of, but should have pis∣tol'd himself, if any such Thing had happened while he was there; that he left <HI>[me]</HI> his Wife, all the Money he had in the World, but 25 <HI>l.</HI> which was as little as he could take with him, to seek his Fortune in the World; he could not doubt but that his Relations, seeing they were all rich, would have taken the poor Children off, and not let them come to the Parish; and that his Wife was young and handsome, and, he thought, might mar∣ry again, perhaps, to her Advantage; and for that very Reason, he never wrote to her, or let her know he was alive, that she might, in a reasonable Term of Years, marry, and perhaps, mend her Fortunes: That he re∣solved never to claim her, because he should rejoice to hear that she had settled to her Mind; and that he wish'd there had been a Law made, to empower a Woman to marry if her Husband was not heard of in so long a Time; which Time, he thought, shou'd not be above four Years, which was long enough to send Word in, to a Wife or Family, from any Part of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> said, she cou'd say nothing to that; but this, that she was satisfied, her Mistress would marry no body, unless she had certain Intelligence that he had been dead, from somebody that saw him buried; but alas! says <HI>Amy,</HI> my Mistress was reduc'd to such dismal Circumstances, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat no-body wou'd be so foolish to think of her, unless it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been somebody to go a begging with her.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> then seeing him so perfectly deluded, made a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and lamentable Out-cry, how she had been delud∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d away, to marry a poor Footman; for he is no worse, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better, <HI>says she,</HI> tho' he calls himself a Lord's Gentle∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; and here, <HI>says</HI> Amy, he has dragg'd me over in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a strange Country, to make a Beggar of me; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen she falls a howling again, and sniveling; which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Way, was all Hypocrisy, but acted so to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire Cre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to every Word of it.</P>
<P>Why <HI>Amy, says he,</HI> you are very well dress'd, you do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot look as if you were in Danger of being a Beggar. Ay, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng him, <HI>says</HI> Amy, they love to have fine Cloaths here, they have never a S—K under them; but I love to
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>
have Money in Cash, rather than a Chest full of fine Cloaths; besides, Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> most of the Cloaths have were given me in the last Place I had, when I went away from my Mistress.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of the Discourse, <HI>Amy</HI> got out of him what Condition he was in, and how he liv'd, upon her Pro∣mise to him, that if ever she came to <HI>England,</HI> and shou'd see her Mistress, she should not let her know that he was a∣live: Alas! Sir, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I may never come to see <HI>Eng∣land</HI> again as long as I live; and if I should, it would be ten thousand to one, whether I shall see my old Mistress; for how should I know which Way to look for her, or what Part of <HI>England</HI> she may be in; not I, <HI>says she,</HI> I don't so much as know how to enquire for her; and if I should, <HI>says</HI> Amy, ever be so happy as to see her, I would not do her so much Mischief as to tell her where you were, Sir, unless she was in a Condition to help herself and you too: This farther deluded him, and made him en∣tirely open in his conversing with her: As to his own Circumstances, he told her, she saw him in the highest Preferment he had arriv'd to, or was ever like to arrive to; for, having no Friends or Acquaintance in <HI>France,</HI> and which was worse, <HI>no Money,</HI> he never expected to rise; that he could have been made a Lieutenant to a Troop of Light-Horse but the Week before, by the Fa∣vour of an Officer in the <HI>Gens d'arms,</HI> who was his Friend; but that he must have found 8000 Livres to have paid for it, to the Gentleman who possess'd it, and had Leave given him to sell: <HI>But where could I get</HI> 800 <HI>Livres</HI> says he, <HI>that never have been Master of</HI> 500 <HI>Livres ready Money, at a Time, since I came into</HI> France.</P>
<P>O'Dear! Sir, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I am very sorry to hear ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say so; I fancy if you got once up to some Preferment you would think of my old Mistress again, and do some∣thing for her; poor Lady, <HI>says</HI> Amy, she wants it, to be sure, and then she falls a crying again; 'tis a sad Thing indeed, <HI>says she,</HI> that you should be so hard put to it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Money, when you had got a Friend to recommend ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and should lose it for Want of Money; ay, so it was <HI>Amy,</HI> indeed, <HI>says he;</HI> but what can a Stranger do, that has neither Money nor Friends? Here <HI>Amy</HI> puts in agai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="99" REF="97"/>
on my Account; well, <HI>says she,</HI> my poor Mistress has had the Loss, tho' she knows nothing of it; O dear! how happy it would have been; to be sure, Sir, you would have help'd her all you could; <HI>Ay,</HI> says he, Amy, <HI>so I would with all my Heart; and even as I am, I would send her some Relief, if I thought she wanted it; only, that then letting her know I was alive, might do her some Prejudice, in Case of her settling, or marrying any Body.</HI></P>
<P>Alas! <HI>says</HI> Amy, marry! who will marry her in the poor Condition she is in? And so their Discourse ended for that Time.</P>
<P>All this was meer Talk on both Sides, and Words of Course; for on farther Enquiry, <HI>Amy</HI> found that he had no such Offer of a Lieutenant's Commission, or a∣ny Thing like it; and that he rambled in his Discourse from one Thing to another: But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>You may be sure, that this Discourse, as <HI>Amy</HI> at first related it, was moving, to the last Degree, upon me; and I was once going to have sent him the 8000 Livres, to purchase the Commission he had spoken of; but as I knew his Character better than any Body, I was wil∣ling to search a little farther into it; and so I set <HI>Amy</HI> to enquire of some other of the Troop, to see what Character he had, and whether there was any Thing in the Story of a Lieutenant's Commission, or no.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> soon came into a better Understanding of him; for she presently learnt that he had a most scoun∣drel Character, that there was nothing of Weight in any Thing he said; but that he was, in short, a meer Sharper; one that would stick at nothing to get Mo∣ney, and there was no depending on any Thing he said; and that, more especially, about the Lieutenant's Commission, she understood, that there was nothing at all in it; but they told her, how he had often made use of <HI>that Sham,</HI> to borrow Money, and move Gen∣tlemen to pity him, and lend him Money, in Hopes to get him Preferment; that he had reported, that he had a Wife and five Children in <HI>England,</HI> whom he main∣tain'd out of his Pay; and by these Shifts had run in∣to
<PB N="100" REF="98"/>
Debt in several Places; and upon several Complaints for such Things, he had been threatned to be turn'd out of the <HI>Gensd'arms;</HI> and that, in short, he was not to be believ'd in any Thing he said, or trusted on any Account.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, <HI>Amy</HI> began to cool in her farther meddling with him; and told me, it was not safe for me to attempt doing him any Good, unless I resolved to put him upon Suspicions and Enquiries, which might be to my Ruin, in the Condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was soon confirmed in this Part of his Character; for the next Time that <HI>Amy</HI> came to talk with him, he discover'd himself more effectually; for while she had put him in Hopes of procuring One to advance the Money for the Lieutenant's Commission for him, upon easy Conditions, he by Degrees, dropt the Discourse, then pretended it was too late, and that he could not get it; and then descended to ask poor <HI>Amy</HI> to lend him 500 Pistoles.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> pretended Poverty; that her Circumstances were but mean; and that she cou'd not raise such a Sum; and this she did, to try him to the utmost; he descended to 300, then to 100, then to 50, and then to a Pistole, which she lent him, and he never inten∣ding to pay it, play'd out of her Sight, as much as he cou'd. Being satisfied that he was the same worthless Thing he had ever been, I threw off all Thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a Man of any Sense, and of any Principle of Honour, I had it in my Thoughts to retire to <HI>England</HI> again, send for him over, and have liv'd honestly with him: But as a Fool is the worst of Husbands to do a Woman Good, so a Fool is the worst Husband a Woman can do Good to: I wou'd willingly have done him Good, but he was not quali∣fied to receive it, or make the best Use of it: had I sent him ten thousand Crowns, instead of eight thou∣sand Livres, and sent it with express Condition, that he should immediately have bought himself the Com∣mission he talk'd of, with Part of the Money, and
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>
have sent some of it to relieve the Necessities of his poor miserable Wife at <HI>London,</HI> and to prevent his Children to be kept by the Parish, it was evident, he wou'd have been still but a private Trooper, and his Wife and Children should still have starv'd at <HI>London,</HI> or been kept of meer Charity, as, for ought he knew, they then were.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore, no Remedy, I was oblig'd to with∣draw my Hand from him, that had been my first De∣stroyer, and reserve the Assistance that I intended to have given him, for another more desirable Opportunity; all that I had now to do, was to keep myself out of his Sight, which was not very difficult for me to do, considering in what Station he liv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and I had several Consultations then, upon the main Question, namely, how to be sure never to chop upon him again, by Chance, and so be surpriz'd into a Discovery; which would have been a fatal Discovery indeed: <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd, that we should always take Care to know where the <HI>Gens d'arms</HI> were quarter'd, and thereby effectually avoid them; and this was one Way.</P>
<P>But this was not so as to be fully to my Satisfaction; no ordinary Way of enquiring where the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were quarter'd, was sufficient to me; but I found out a Fellow, who was compleatly qualified for the Work of a Spy, (for <HI>France</HI> has Plenty of such People,) this Man I employ'd to be a constant and particular Atten∣dant upon his Person and Motions; and he was especi∣ally employ'd, and order'd to haunt him as a Ghost; that he should scarce let him be ever out of his Sight; he perform'd this to a Nicety, and fail'd not to give me a perfect Journal of all his Motions, from Day to Day; and whether for his Pleasures, or his Business, was al∣ways at his Heels.</P>
<P>This was somewhat expensive, and such a Fellow merited to be well paid; but he did his Business so ex∣quisitely punctual, that this poor Man scarce went out of the House, without my knowing the Way he went,
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
the Company he kept, when he went Abroad, and when he stay'd at Home.</P>
<P>By this extraordinary Conduct I made myself safe, and so went out in Publick, or stay'd at Home, as I found he was, or was not, in a Possiblity of being at <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Versailles,</HI> or any Place I had Occasion to be at. This though it was very chargeable, yet as I found it absolutely necessary, so I took no Thought about the Expence of it; for I knew I cou'd not purchase my Safety too dear.</P>
<P>By this Management I found an Opportunity to see what a most insignificant, unthinking Life the poor indolent Wretch, who by his unactive Temper had at first been my Ruin, now liv'd; how he only rose in the Morning, to go to-Bed at Night; that saving the ne∣cessary Motion of the Troops, which he was oblig'd to attend, he was a meer motionless Animal, of no Con∣sequence in the World; that he seem'd to be one, who, tho' he was indeed alive, had no manner of Bu∣siness in Life, but to stay to be call'd out of it; he nei∣ther kept any Company, minded any Sport, play'd at any Game, or indeed, did any Thing of Moment; but, in short, saunter'd about, like one, that it was not two Livres Value whether he was dead or alive; that when he was gone, would leave no Remembrance behind him that ever he was here; that if ever he did any Thing in the World to be talk'd of, it was, only to get five Beggars, and starve his Wife: the Journal of his Life, which I had constantly sent me every Week, was the least significant of any Thing of its Kind, that was ever seen; as it had really nothing of Earnest in it, so it wou'd make no Jest, to relate it; it was not important enough, so much as to make the Reader merry withal; and for that Reason I omit it.</P>
<P>Yet this Nothing-doing Wretch was I oblig'd to watch and guard against, as against the only Thing that was capable of doing me Hurt in the World. I was to shun him, as we would shun a Spectre, or even the Devil, if he was actually in our Way; and it cost me after the Rate of a 150 Livres a Month, and very
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>
cheap too, to have this Creature constantly kept in View; that is to say, my Spy undertook never to let him be out of his Sight an Hour, but so as that he cou'd give an Account of him; which was much the easier to be done, considering his Way of Living; for he was sure, that for whole Weeks together, he wou'd be ten Hours of the Day half asleep on a Bench at the Tavern Door where he quarter'd, or drunk within the House.</P>
<P>Tho' this wicked Life he led, sometimes mov'd me to pity him, and to wonder how so well bred gentle∣manly a Man as he once was, could degenerate into such an useless Thing as he now appear'd; yet, at the same Time, it gave me most contemptible Thoughts of him, and made me often say, I was a Warning for all the Ladies of <HI>Europe,</HI> against marrying of Fools; a Man of Sense falls in the World, and gets up again, and a Woman has some Chance for herself; but with a Fool! once fall, and ever undone; once in the Ditch, and die in the Ditch; once poor, and sure to starve.</P>
<P>But 'tis Time to have done with him; once I had nothing to hope for, but to see him again; now my only Felicity was, if possible, never to see him, and, above all, to keep him from seeing me; which, as a∣bove, I took effectual Care of.</P>
<P>I was now return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> my little <HI>Son of Honour,</HI> as I call'd him, was left at—, where my last Coun∣try Seat then was, and I came to <HI>Paris,</HI> at the Prince's Request; thither he came to me as soon as I arriv'd, and told me, he came to give me Joy of my Return, and to make his Acknowledgments, for that I had given him a Son: I thought indeed, he had been go∣ing to give me a Present, and so he did the next Day, but in what he said then, he jested with me: He gave me his Company all the Evening; Supp'd with me a∣bout Midnight, and did me the Honour, as I then call'd it, to lodge me in his Arms all the Night, tel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing me, in jest, that the best Thanks for a Son born, was giving the Pledge for another.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102"/>
But as I hinted, so it was, the next Morning he laid me down, on my Toilet, a Purse with 300 Pistoles: I saw him lay it down, and understood what he meant, but I took no Notice of it, till I came to it (as it were) casually; then I gave a great Cry-out, and fell a scold∣ing in my Way, for he gave me all possible Freedom of Speech on such Occasions: I told him, he was un∣kind; that he would never give me an Opportunity to ask him for any Thing; and that he forc'd me to blush, by being too much oblig'd, and the like; all which I knew was very agreeable to him; for as he was boun∣tiful beyond Measure, so he was infinitely oblig'd by my being so backward to ask any Favours; and I was even with him, for I never ask'd him for a Far∣thing in my Life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had either perfectly studied the Art of Humour, or else, what was the greatest Difficulty to others, was natural to me; adding, That nothing cou'd be more obliging to a Man of Honour, than not to be solliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing cou'd be craving upon him; that he left no Room for it; that I hop'd he did not give, meerly to avoid the Trouble of being impor∣tun'd; I told him, he might depend upon it, that I should be reduced very low indeed, before I offer'd to disturb him that Way.</P>
<P>He said, a Man of Honour ought always to know what he ought to do; and as he did nothing but what he knew was reasonable, he gave me Leave to be free with him, if I wanted any Thing; that he had too much Value for me, to deny me any Thing, if I ask'd; but that it was infinitely agreeable to him to hear me say, that what he did, was to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We strain'd Compliments thus a great while, and as he had me in his Arms most Part of the Time, so upon all my Expressions of his Bounty to me, he put a Stop to me with his Kisses, and wou'd admit me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I should in this Place mention, that this Prince was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' at that Time he resided at
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>
<HI>Paris,</HI> and was much at Court, where, I suppose, he had or expected some considerable Employment: But I mention it on this Account; that a few Days after this, he came to me, and told me, he was come to bring me not the most welcome News that ever I heard from him in his Life; I look'd at him, a little sur∣priz'd; but he return'd, Do not be uneasy, it is as un∣pleasant to me, as to you, but I come to consult with you about it, and see if it cannot be made a little easy to us both.</P>
<P>I seem'd still more concern'd, and surpriz'd; at last he said, it was, that he believ'd he should be oblig'd to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> which tho' otherwise it was very agree∣able to him, yet his parting with me, made it a very dull Thing but to think of.</P>
<P>I sat mute, as one Thunder-struck, for a good while; and it presently occur'd to me, that I was going to lose him, which, indeed, I cou'd but ill bear the Thoughts of; and as he told me, I turn'd pale: What's the Mat∣ter? said he, hastily; I have surpriz'd you indeed; and stepping to the Side-board, fills a Dram of Cordial-Water, (which was of his own bringing) and comes to me, Be not surpriz'd, said he, I'll go no-where without you; adding several other Things so kind, as nothing could exceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much surpriz'd at first, believing that this was, as it often happens in such Cases, only a Project to drop me, and break off an Amour, which he had now carried on so long; and a thousand Thoughts whirl'd about my Head in the few Moments while I was kept in sus∣pence; (for they were but a few) I say, I was indeed surpriz'd, and might, perhaps, look pale; but I was not in any Danger of fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not a little pleased me, to see him so concerned and anxious about me; but I stopped a little, when he put the Cordial to my Mouth, and taking the Glass in my Hand, <HI>I said,</HI> my Lord, your Words are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfinitely more of a Cordial to me than this Citron; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s nothing can be a greater Affliction than to lose you,
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>
so nothing can be a greater Satisfaction than the As∣surance, that I shall not have that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He made me sit down, and sat down by me, and after saying a thousand kind Things to me; he turns upon me, with a Smile, why, will you venture yourself to <HI>Italy</HI> with me? <HI>says he;</HI> I stopy'd a-while, and then answer'd, that I wonder'd he would ask me that Ques∣tion; for I would go any where in the World, or all over the World, wherever he shou'd desire me, and give me the Felicity of his Company.</P>
<P>Then he enter'd into a long Account of the Occasion of his Journey, and how the King had engag'd him to go, and some other Circumstances, which are not proper to enter into here; it being by no means proper to say any thing, that might lead the Reader into the least Guess at the Person.</P>
<P>But to cut short this Part of the Story, and the His∣tory of our Journey, and Stay abroad, which would almost sill up a Volume of itself, I say, we spent all that Evening in chearful Consultations about the Man∣ner of our Travelling; the Equipage and Figure he shou'd go in; and in what Manner I shou'd go: Seve∣ral Ways were propos'd, but none seem'd feasible; till, at last, I told him, I thought it would be so trouble∣some, so expensive, and so publick, that it wou'd he many Ways inconvenient to him; and tho' it was a kind of Death to me to lose him, yet that rather than so very much perplex his Affairs, I wou'd submit to any Thing.</P>
<P>At the next Visit I fill'd his Head with the same Difficulties, and then, at last, came over him with a Proposal, that I wou'd stay in <HI>Paris,</HI> or where else he shou'd direct; and when I heard of his safe Arrival, wou'd come away by myself, and place myself as near him as I cou'd.</P>
<P>This gave him no Satisfaction at all; nor wou'd he hear any more of it; but if I durst venture myself as he call'd it, such a Journey, he wou'd not lose the Satis∣faction of my Company; and as for the Expence, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was not to be nam'd, neither indeed was there room to name it; for I sound, that he travell'd at the KING'S
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
Expence, as well for himself, as for all his Equipage; being upon a Piece of secret Service of the last Im∣portance.</P>
<P>But after several Debates between ourselves, he came to this Resolution, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would travel <HI>Incognito,</HI> and so he shou'd avoid all publick Notice, either of him∣self, or who went with him; and that then he shou'd not only carry me with him, but have a perfect Leisure of enjoying my agreeable Company, <HI>(as he was pleas'd to call it)</HI> all the Way.</P>
<P>This was so obliging, that nothing cou'd be more; so upon this Foot, he immediately set to Work to pre∣pare Things for his Journey; and by his Directions, so did I too: But now I had a terrible Difficulty upon me, and which Way to get over it, I knew not; and that was, in what Manner to take Care of what I had to leave behind me; I was rich, as I have said, very rich, and what to do with it, I knew not, nor who to leave in Trust, I knew not; I had no-body but <HI>Amy</HI> in the World, and to travel without <HI>Amy,</HI> was very uncomfort∣able; or to leave all I had in the World with her, and if she miscarried, be ruin'd at once, was still a frightful Thought; for <HI>Amy</HI> might die, and whose Hands Things might fall into, I knew not: This gave me great Un∣easiness, and I knew not what to do; for I could not mention it to the Prince, lest he should see that I was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this easy to me; for in con∣certing Measures for our Journey, he started the Thing himself, and ask'd me merrily one Evening, who I wou'd trust with all my Wealth, in my Absence?</P>
<P>My Wealth, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> except what I owe to your Goodness, is but small; but yet, that little I have, I confess, causes some Thoughtfulness; because I have no Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI> that I dare trust with it, nor any-body but my Woman, to leave in the House; and how to do without her upon the Road, I do not well know.</P>
<P>As to the Road, be not concern'd, <HI>says the Prince,</HI> I'll provide you Servants to your Mind; and as for your Woman, if you can trust her, leave her here, and I'll
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>
put you in a Way how to secure Things, as well as if you were at Home: I bow'd, and told him, I cou'd not be put into better Hands than his own, and that therefore, I wou'd govern all my Measures by his Di∣rections; so we talk'd no more of it that Night.</P>
<P>The next Day he sent me in a great Iron Chest, so large, that it was as much as six lusty Fellows could get up the Steps, into the House; and in this I put, indeed, all my Wealth; and for my Safety, he order'd a good honest ancient Man and his Wife to be in the House with her, to keep her Company, and a Maid-Servant, and Boy; so that there was a good Family, and <HI>Amy</HI> was Madam, the Mistress of the House.</P>
<P>Things being thus secur'd, we set out <HI>Incog,</HI> as he call∣ed it; but we had two Coaches and six Horses; two Chai∣ses; and about eight Men-Servants on Horseback, all very well arm'd.</P>
<P>Never was Woman better us'd in this World, that went upon no other Account than I did; I had three Women-Servants to wait on me, one whereof was an old Madam—, who thoroughly understood her Business, and manag'd every Thing, as if she had been <HI>Mayer Domo;</HI> so I had no Trouble; they had one Coach to themselves, and the Prince and I in the other; only that sometimes, where he knew it necessary, I went into their Coach; and one particular Gentleman of the Retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I shall say no more of the Journey, than that when we came to those frightful Mountains the <HI>Alps,</HI> there was no travelling in our Coaches, so he order'd a Horse-Litter, but carried by Mules, to be provided for me, and himself went on Horseback; the Coaches went some other Way back to <HI>Lyons;</HI> then we had Coaches hir'd at <HI>Turin,</HI> which met us at <HI>Susa;</HI> so that we were ac∣commodated again, and went by easy Journeys after∣wards to <HI>Rome,</HI> where his Business, <HI>whatever it was</HI> call'd him to stay some Time; and from thence to <HI>Venite.</HI></P>
<P>He was as good as his Word indeed, for I had the Pleasure of his Company, and in a Word, engross'd his Conversation almost all the Way: He took Delight in showing me every Thing that was to be seen, and
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>
particularly, in telling me something of the History of every Thing he show'd me.</P>
<P>What valuable Pains were here thrown away upon one, whom he was sure, at last, to abandon with Re∣gret! How below himself, did a Man of Quality, and of a thousand Accomplishments, behave in all this! 'Tis one of my Reasons for entring into this Part, which otherwise wou'd not be worth relating: Had I been a Daughter, or a Wife, of whom it might be said, that he had a just Concern in their Instruction or Improve∣ment, it had been an admirable Step; but all this to a Whore! to one whom he carried with him upon no Ac∣count, that could be rationally agrecable; and none but to gratify the meanest of human Frailties: This was the Wonder of it.</P>
<P>But such is the Power of a vicious Inclination; Whor∣ing was, in a Word, his darling Crime; the worst Excursion he made; for he was otherwise, one of the most excellent Persons in the World; no Passions; no furious Excursions; no oftentatious Pride; the most humble, courteous, affable Person in the World; not an Oath, not an indecent Word, or the least Blemish in Behaviour, was to be seen in all his Conversation, ex∣cept as before excepted; and it has given me Occasion for many dark Reflections since, to look back and think, that I should be the Snare of such a Person's Life; that I should influence him to so much Wick∣edness; and that I should be the Instrument in the Hand of the Devil, to do him so much Prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two Years upon this <HI>Grand Tour,</HI> as it may be call'd, during most of which I resided at <HI>Rome,</HI> or at <HI>Venice,</HI> having only been twice at <HI>Florence,</HI> and once at <HI>Naples:</HI> I made some very diverting and useful Observations in all these Places; and particularly of the Conduct of the Ladies; for I had Opportunity to con∣verse very much among them, by the Help of the old Witch that travell'd with us; she had been at <HI>Naples,</HI> and at <HI>Venice,</HI> and had liv'd in the former several Years, where, as I found, she had liv'd but a loose Life, as indeed the Women of <HI>Naples</HI> generally do; and,
<PB N="110" REF="108"/>
in short, I found she was fully acquainted with all the intriguing Arts of that Part of the World.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little female <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, who being taken at Sea by a <HI>Malthese</HI> Man of War, was brought in there; and of her I learnt the <HI>Turkish</HI> Lan∣guage, their Way of Dressing, and Dancing, and some <HI>Turkish,</HI> or rather <HI>Moorish</HI> Songs, of which I made Use, to my Advantage, on an extraordinary Occasion, some Years after, as you shall hear in its Place. I need not say I learnt <HI>Italian</HI> too, for I got pretty well Mistress of that, before I had been there a Year; and as I had Leisure enough, and lov'd the Language, I read all the <HI>Italian</HI> Books I cou'd come at.</P>
<P>I began to be so in Love with <HI>Italy,</HI> especially with <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that I cou'd have been very well sa∣tisfied to have sent for <HI>Amy,</HI> and have taken up my Re∣sidence there for Life.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Rome,</HI> I did not like it at all: The Swarms of Ecclesiasticks of all Kinds, on one side, and the scoun∣drel Rabbles of the common People, on the other, make <HI>Rome</HI> the unpleasantest Place in the World to live in; the innumerable Number of Valets, Lacqueys, and other Servants, is such, that they us'd to say, that there are very few of the common People in <HI>Rome,</HI> but what have been Footmen, or Porters, or Grooms to Cardinals, or foreign Ambassadors: In a Word, they have an Air of sharping and couzening, quarrelling and scolding, upon their general Behaviour; and when I was there, the Footmen made such a Broil between two great Fa∣milies in <HI>Rome,</HI> about which of their Coaches (the Ladies being in the Coaches on either side) shou'd give Way to t'other, that there was above thirty People wounded on both Sides, five or six kill'd outright, and both the La∣dies frighted almost to Death.</P>
<P>But I have no Mind to write the History of my Tra∣vels on this Side of the World, at least, not now; it would be too full of Variety.</P>
<P>I must not, however, omit, that the Prince continued in all this Journey, the most kind, obliging Person to me in the World; and so constant, that tho' we were in a Country, where 'tis well known all Manner of
<PB N="111" REF="109"/>
Liberties are taken, I am yet well assur'd, he neither took the Liberty he knew he might have, or so much as desir'd it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this noble Person, on that Account; had he been but half so true, so faithful and constant to the best Lady in the World, I mean his Princess, how glorious a Virtue had it been in him? and how free had he been from those just Reflections which touch'd him, in her Behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had some very agreeable Conversations upon this Subject; and once he told me, with a kind of more than ordinary Concern upon his Thoughts, that he was great∣ly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and difficult Journey, for that I had kept him honest: I look'd up in his Face, and colour'd as red as Fire: Well, well, <HI>says he,</HI> do not let that surprize you; I do say, you have kept me honest: My Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> 'tis not for me to explain your Words, but I wish I cou'd turn 'em my own Way; I hope, <HI>says I,</HI> and believe we are both as honest as we can be, in our Circumstances; ay, ay, <HI>says he,</HI> and honester than I doubt I shou'd have been, if you had not been with me; I cannot say but if you had not been here, I should have wandered among the gay World here, in <HI>Naples,</HI> and in <HI>Venice</HI> too; for 'tis not such a Crime here, as 'tis in other Places; but I protest, <HI>says he,</HI> I have not touch'd a Woman in <HI>Italy,</HI> but your∣self; and more than that, I have not so much as had any Desire to it; so that, I say, you have kept me honest.</P>
<P>I was silent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from speaking, with kissing me, for really I knew not what to say: I was once going to say, that if his Lady, the Princess, had been with him, she wou'd, doubtless, have had the same Influence upon his Virtue, with infinitely more Advantage to him; but I consider'd this might give him Offence; and besides, such Things might have been dangerous to the Circumstance I stood in, so it pass'd off: But I must confess, I saw that he was quite another Man, as to Women, than I under∣stood he had always been before; and it was a particular
<PB N="112" REF="110"/>
Satisfaction to me, that I was thereby convinc'd that what he said, was true, and that he was, as I may say, <HI>all my own.</HI></P>
<P>I was with Child again in this Journey, and lay-in at <HI>Venice,</HI> but was not so happy as before. I brought him another Son, and a very fine Boy it was, but it liv'd not above two Months; nor, after the first Touches of Affection (which are usual, I believe, to all Mother) were over, was I sorry the Child did not live, the ne∣cessary Difficulties attending it in our travelling being consider'd.</P>
<P>After these several Perambulations, my Lord told me, his Business began to close, and we wou'd think of re∣turning to <HI>France;</HI> which I was very glad of, but prin∣cipally on Account of my Treasure I had there, which, as you have heard, was very considerable: It is true, I had Letters very frequently from my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> with Accounts that every Thing was very safe, and that was very much to my Satisfaction: However, as the Prince's Negotiations were at an End, and he was ob∣lig'd to return, I was very glad to go; so we return'd from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Turin;</HI> and in the Way, I saw the famous City of <HI>Milan;</HI> from <HI>Turin,</HI> we went over the Mountains again, as before, and our Coaches met us at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt a Voisin,</HI> between <HI>Chamberry</HI> and <HI>Lyons;</HI> and so by ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Journeys, we arriv'd safely at <HI>Paris,</HI> having been absent about two Years, wanting about eleven Days, as abore.</P>
<P>I found the little Family just as we left them; and <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd for Joy, when she saw me, and I almost did the same.</P>
<P>The Prince took his Leave of me the Night before; for as he told me, he knew he shou'd be met upon the Road by several Persons of Quality, and perhaps, by the Princess herself; so we lay at two different Inns that Night, lest some shou'd come quite to the Place, as in∣deed it happen'd.</P>
<P>After this, I saw him not for above twenty Days, being taken-up in his Family, and also with Business; but he sent me his Gentleman, to tell me the Reason of it; and bid me not be uneasy; and that satisfied me effectually.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="111"/>
In all this Affluence of my good Fortune, I did not forget that I had been Rich and Poor once already, al∣ternately; and that I ought to know, that the Cir∣cumstances I was now in, were not to be expected to last always; that I had one Child, and expected ano∣ther: and if I bred often, it wou'd something impair me in the great Article that supported my Interest, I mean, what he call'd Beauty; that as that declin'd, I might expect the Fire wou'd abate, and the Warmth with which I was now so ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress'd, wou'd cool, and in Time, like the other Mistresses of great Men, I might be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my Business to take Care that I shou'd fall as softly as I cou'd.</P>
<P>I say, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good Provision for myself, as if I had had nothing to have subsisted on, but what I now gain'd; whereas I had not less than ten thousand Pounds, as I said above, which I had amass'd, or secur'd rather, out of the Ruins of my faithful Friend, the Jeweller; and which, he little think∣ing of what was so near him when he went out, told me, tho' in a kind of a Jest, was all my own, if he was knock'd o'th' Head; and which upon that Title, I took Care to preserve.</P>
<P>My greatest Difficulty now, was, how to secure my Wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I had greatly added to this Wealth, by the generous Bounty of the Prince—, and the more, by the private re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd Manner of Living, which he rather desir'd for Pri∣vacy, than Parsimony; for he supply'd me for a more magnificent Way of Life than I desir'd, if it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roper.</P>
<P>I shall cut short the History of this prosperous Wick∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness, with telling you I brought him a third Son, within little more than eleven Months after our Return <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om <HI>Italy;</HI> that now I liv'd a little more openly, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent by a particular Name which he gave me abroad; at which I must omit: <HI>viz.</HI> the Countess <HI>de—,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Coaches and Servants, suitable to the Quality he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d given me the Appearance of; and which is more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an usually happens in such Cases, this held eight Years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the Beginning; during which Time, as I had
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>
been very faithful to him, so, I must say, as above that I believe he was so separated to me, that whereas he usually had two or three Women, which he kept privately, he had not in all that Time meddled with any of them, but that I had so perfectly engross'd him, that he dropt them all; not, perhaps, that he sav'd much by it, for I was a very chargeable Mistress to him, that I must acknowledge; but it was all owing to his particular Affection to me, not to my Extravagance; for, as I said, he never gave me leave to ask him for any Thing, but pour'd in his Favours and Presents faster than I expected, and so fast, as I could not have the Assurance to make the least Mention of desiring more.</P>
<P>Nor do I speak this of my own Guess, I mean, about his Constancy to me, and his quitting all other Women; but the old <HI>Harradan,</HI> as I may call her, whom he made the Guide of our travelling, and who was a strange old Creature, told me a thousand Stories of his Gallantry, as she call'd it, and how, as he had no less than three Mistresses at one Time, and, as I found, all of her procuring, he had of a Sudden, dropt them all, and that he was entirely lost to both her and them; that they did believe he had fallen into some new Hands, but she could never hear who, or where, till he sent for her to go this Journey; and then the old Hag complimented me upon his Choice, That she did not wonder I had so engross'd him; so much Beauty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there she stopt.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you may be sure, to my particular Satisfaction, <HI>viz.</HI> that as above, I had him all my own.</P>
<P>But the highest Tide has its Ebb; and in all Things of this Kind, there is a Reflux which sometimes also is more impetuously violent than the first Aggression: My Prince was a Man of a vast Fortune, tho' no Sove∣reign, and therefore there was no Probability that the Expence of keeping a Mistress could be injurious to him, as to his Estate; he had also several Employ∣ments, both out of <HI>France,</HI> as well as in it; for, as above, I say, he was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he liv'd in that Court: he had a Princess, a Wife, with
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>
whom he had lived several Years, and a Woman <HI>(so the Voice of Fame reported)</HI> the most valuable of her Sex; of Birth equal to him, if not superior, and of Fortune proportionable; but in Beauty, Wit, and a thousand good Qualities, superior not to most Women, but even to all her Sex; and as to her Virtue, the Character which was most justly her due, was that of, not only the best of Princesses, but even the best of Women.</P>
<P>They liv'd in the utmost Harmony, as with such a Princess it was impossible to be otherwise; but yet the Princess was not insensible that her Lord had his <HI>Foibless,</HI> that he did make some Excursions; and particularly, that he had one Favourite Mistress which sometimes engross'd him more than she (the Princess) cou'd wish, or be easily satisfied with: However, she was so good, so generous, so truly kind a Wife, that she never gave him any Uneasiness on this Account; except so much as must arise from his Sense of her bearing the Affront of it with such Patience, and such a profound Respect for him, as was in itself enough to have reform'd him, and did sometimes shock his generous Mind, so as to keep him at Home, as I may call it, a great while to∣gether; and it was not long before I not only perceiv'd it by his Absence, but really got a Knowledge of the Reason of it, and once or twice he even acknowledg'd it to me.</P>
<P>It was a Point that lay not in me to manage; I made kind of Motion, once or twice, to him, to leave me, and keep himself to her, as he ought by the Laws and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites of Matrimony to do, and argu'd the Generosity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Princess to him, to perswade him; but I was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ypocrite; for had I prevail'd with him really to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nest, I had lost him, which I could not bear the thoughts of; and he might easily see I was not in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nest. One Time in particular, when I took upon to talk at this rate, I found when I argued so much the Virtue and Honour, the Birth, and above all, generous Usage he found in the Person of the Prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with Respect to his private Amours, and how it
<PB N="116" REF="114"/>
should prevail upon him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I found it began to af∣fect him, and he return'd, <HI>And do you indeed,</HI> says he, <HI>perswade me to leave you? Would you have me think you sincere?</HI> I look'd up in his Face, smiling, <HI>Not for any other Favourite,</HI> my Lord, said I; <HI>that wou'd break my Heart;</HI> but <HI>for Madam, the Princess!</HI> said I, and then I could say no more, Tears follow'd. and I sat silent a while: Well, said he, if ever I do leave you, it shall be on the virtuous Account; it shall be for the Princess, I assure you it shall be for no other Woman; <HI>That's enough, my Lord,</HI> said I, <HI>There I ought to submit; and while I am assured it shall be for no other Mistress, I pro∣mise your Highness, I will not repine;</HI> or that, if I do, <HI>it shall be a silent Grief, it shall not interrupt your Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>All this while I said I knew not what, and said what I was no more able to do, than he was able to leave me: which, at that Time, he own'd he cou'd not do, no, not for the Princess herself.</P>
<P>But another Turn of Affairs determin'd this Matter, for the Princess was taken very ill, and in the Opinion of all her Physicians, very dangerously so. In her Sick∣ness she desir'd to speak with her Lord, and to take her Leave of him: At this grievous Parting, she said so ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> passionate kind Things to him; lamented that she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> left him no Children, (she had had three, but they were dead) hinted to him, that it was one of the chief Things which gave her Satisfaction in Death, as to this World, that she should leave him Room to have Heirs to his Family, by some Princess that should supply her Place; with all Humility, but with a Christian Earnestness, recommended to him to do Justice to such Princess, whoever it should be, from whom, to be sure, he would expect Justice; that is to say, to keep to her singly, according to the solemnest Part of the Marriage-covenant; humbly ask'd his High∣ness Pardon, if she had any way offended him; and appealing to Heaven, before whose Tribunal she was to appear, that she had never violated her Honour, or her Duty to him; and praying to Jesus, and the
<PB N="117" REF="115"/>
Blessed Virgin, for his Highness; and thus with the most moving, and most passionate Expressions of her Affection to him, took her last Leave of him, and died the next Day.</P>
<P>This Discourse from a Princess so valuable in herself, and so dear to him, and the Loss of her following so immediately after, made such deep Impressions on him, that he look'd back with Detestation upon the former Part of his Life; grew melancholy and reserv'd; chang∣ed his Society, and much of the general Conduct of his Life; resolv'd on a Life regulated most strictly by the Rules of Virtue, and Piety; and in a Word, was quite another Man.</P>
<P>The first Part of his Reformation was a Storm upon me; for, about ten Days after the Princess's Funeral, he sent a Message to me by his Gentleman, intimating, tho' in very civil Terms, and with a short Preamble, or Introduction, that he desir'd I would not take it ill that he was oblig'd to let me know, that he could see me no more: His Gentleman told me a long Story of the new Regulation of Life his Lord had taken up, and that he had been so afflicted for the Loss of his Princess, that he thought it would either shorten his Life, or he wou'd retire into some Religious House, to and his Days in Solitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any body to suppose how I receiv'd this News; I was indeed exceedingly surpriz'd at it, and had much ado to support myself, when the first Part of it was deliver'd; tho' the Gentleman deliver'd his Errand with great Respect, and with all the Regard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o me that he was able, and with a great deal of Ce∣remony; also telling me how much he was concern'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring me such a Message.</P>
<P>But when I heard the Particulars of the Story at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge, and especially that of the Lady's Discourse to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince, a little before her Death, I was fully satisfied; knew very well he had done nothing but what any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an must do, that had a true Sense upon him of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stice of the Princess's Discourse to him, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessity there was of his altering his Course of Life,
<PB N="118" REF="116"/>
if he intended to be either a Christian or an honest Man: I say, when I heard this, I was perfectly easy; I confess it was a Circumstance that it might be reason∣ably expected should have wrought something also up∣on me; I that had so much to reflect upon more than the Prince; that had now no more Temptation of Po∣verty, or of the powerful Motive, which <HI>Amy</HI> used with me, namely, <HI>comply and live; deny and starve;</HI> I say, I that had no Poverty to introduce Vice, but was grown not only well supply'd, but rich, and not only rich, but was very rich; in a Word, richer than I knew how to think of; for the Truth of it was, that thinking of it sometimes almost distracted me, for Want of knowing how to dispose of it, and for Fear of losing it all again by some Cheat or Trick, not knowing any Body that I could commit the Trust of it to.</P>
<P>Besides, I should add at the Close of this Affair, that the Prince did not, as I may say, turn me off rudely, and with Disgust; but with all the Decency and Good∣ness peculiar to himself, and that could consist with a Man reformed, and struck with the Sense of his hav∣ing abus'd so good a Lady as his late Princess had been; nor did he send me away empty, but did every Thing like himself; and in particular, ordered his Gentleman to pay the Rent of the House, and all the Expence of his two Sons; and to tell me how they were taken Care of, and where; and also that I might at all times inspect the Usage they had, and if I dislik'd any Thing it should be rectify'd; and having thus finished every Thing, he retir'd into <HI>Lorrain,</HI> or somewhere that Way, where he had an Estate, and I never heard o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him more, I mean, not as a Mistress.</P>
<P>Now I was at Liberty to go to any Part of the World, and take Care of my Money myself. The first Thing that I resolved to do, was to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> for there, I thought, being among my Country folks, (for I esteemed myself an <HI>English-Wo¦man,</HI> tho' I was born in <HI>France)</HI> for there, I say, thought I could better manage Things than in <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="117"/>
at least, that I would be in less Danger of being cir∣cumvented and deceived; but how to get away with such a Treasure as I had with me, was a difficult Point, and what I was greatly at a Loss about.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> that was a Person of great Reputation for a Man of Substance and of Honesty, but I had no Manner of Acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted with him, so as to discover my Circumstances to him; but at last I employed my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> such I must be allowed to call her, (notwithstanding what has been said of her) because she was in the Place of a Maid-servant; I say, I employed my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to go to him, and she got a Recommendation to him from somebody else, I knew not who; so that she got Access to him well enough.</P>
<P>But now was my Case as bad as before; for when I came to him, what could I do? I had Money and Jew∣els to a vast Value, and I might leave all those with him; that I might indeed do; and so I might with se∣veral other Merchants in <HI>Paris,</HI> who would give me Bills for it payable at <HI>London,</HI> but then I ran a Hazard of my Money; and I had no Body at <HI>London</HI> to send the Bills to, and so to stay till I had an Account that they were accepted; for I had not one Friend in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that I could have Recourse to, so that indeed I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>In this Case I had no Remedy, but that I must trust somebody; so I sent <HI>Amy</HI> to this <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, as I said above. He was a little surprized when <HI>Amy</HI> came to him, and talk'd to him of remitting a Sum of about 12000 Pistoles to <HI>England,</HI> and began to think she came to put some Cheat upon him; but when he found that <HI>Amy</HI> was but a Servant, and that I came to him myself, the Case was alter'd presently.</P>
<P>When I came to him myself, I presently saw such a Plainness in his Dealing, and such Honesty in his Coun∣tenance, that I made no Scruple to tell him my whole Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That I was a Widow; that I had some Jewels to dispose of, and also some Money, which I had a Mind to send to <HI>England,</HI> and to follow there
<PB N="120" REF="118"/>
myself; but being but a Woman, and having no Cor∣respondence in <HI>London,</HI> or any where else, I knew not what to do, or how to secure my Effects.</P>
<P>He dealt very candidly with me, and advised me, when he knew my Case so particularly, to take Bills upon <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to go that Way to <HI>England;</HI> for that I might lodge my Treasure in the Bank there, in the most secure Manner in the World; and that there he could recommend me to a Man who perfectly under∣stood Jewels, and would deal faithfully with me in the disposing them.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but scrupled very much the travel∣ling so far in a strange Country, and especially with such a Treasure about me; that whether known or concealed I did not know how to venture with it: Then he told me he would try to dispose of them there, that is, at <HI>Paris,</HI> and convert them into Money, and so get me Bills for the whole; and in a few Days he brought a <HI>Jew</HI> to me who pretended to buy the Jewels.</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Jew</HI> saw the Jewels, I saw my Fol∣ly; and it was ten thousand to one but I had been ra∣ined, and perhaps put to Death in as cruel a Manner as possible; and I was put in such a Fright by it, that I was once upon the Point of flying for my Life, and leaving the Jewels and Money too, in the Hands of the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> without any Bills or any Thing else. The Case was thus:</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Jew</HI> saw the Jewels, he falls a job∣bering in <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Portuguese</HI> to the Merchant, and I could presently perceive that they were in some great Surprize both of them. The <HI>Jew</HI> held up his Hands, look'd at me with some Horror, then talked <HI>Dutch</HI> again, and put himself into a thousand Shapes, twist∣ing his Body, and wringing up his Face this Way and that Way, in his Discourse; stamping with his Feet, and throwing abroad his Hands, as if he was not in a Rage only, but in a meer Fury. Then he would turn, and give a Look at me, like the Devil. I thought I ne∣ver saw any Thing so frightful in my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="119"/>
At length I put in a Word; Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, what is all this Discourse to my Business? What is this Gentleman in all these Passions about? I wish, if he is to treat with me, he would speak that I may understand him; or if you have Business of your own between you that is to be done first, let me with∣draw, and I will come again when you are at Leisure.</P>
<P>No, no, Madam, <HI>says the</HI> Dutchman, very kindly, you must not go, all our Discourse was about you, and your Jewels, and you shall hear it presently, it con∣cerns you very much, I assure you: Concern me, <HI>says I,</HI> what can it concern me so much, as to put this Gen∣tleman into such Agonies, and what makes him give me such Devil's Looks as he does? Why, he looks as if he would devour me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> understood me presently, continuing in a kind of Rage, and spoke in <HI>French,</HI> Yes, Madam, it does concern you very much, very much, very much, re∣peating the Words, shaking his Head; and then turn∣ing to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> pray tell her what is the Case; no, <HI>says the Merchant,</HI> not yet, let us talk a little farther of it by ourselves; upon which, they withdrew into another Room, where still they talk'd very high, but in a Language I did not understand: I began to be a little surprised at what the <HI>Jew</HI> had said, you may be sure, and eager to know what he meant, and was very impatient till the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant came back, and that so impatient, that I called one of his Servants to let him know, I desired to speak with him; when he came in, I asked his Pardon for being so im∣patient, but told him I could not be easy, till he had told me what the Meaning of all this was: Why Ma∣dam, <HI>says the Dutch Merchant,</HI> in short, the Meaning is, what I am surprised at too: This Man is a <HI>Jew,</HI> and understands Jewels perfectly well, and that was the Reason I sent for him, to dispose of them to him for you; but as soon as he saw them, he knew the Jewels very distinctly, and flying out in a Passion, as you see <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did, told me, in short, that they were the very Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el of Jewels which the <HI>English</HI> Jeweller had about him,
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
who was robb'd going to <HI>Versailles,</HI> (about eight Years ago) to shew them the Prince <HI>d'—,</HI> and that it was for these very Jewels that the poor Gentleman was mur∣dered; and he is in all this Agony to make me ask you, how you came by them; and he says, you ought to be charged with the Robbery and Murder, and put to the Question, to discover who were the Persons that did it, that they might be brought to Justice: While he said this, the <HI>Jew</HI> came impudently back into the Room without calling, which a little surprised me again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant spoke pretty good <HI>English,</HI> and he knew that the <HI>Jew</HI> did not understand <HI>English</HI> at all; so he told me the latter Part, when the <HI>Jew</HI> came into the Room, in <HI>English;</HI> at which I smil'd, which put the <HI>Jew</HI> into his mad Fit again, and shaking his Head, and making his Devil's Faces again, he seemed to threaten me for Laughing; saying in <HI>French,</HI> This was an Affair I should have little Reason to laugh at, and the like; at this, I laugh'd again, and flouted him, let∣ting him see that I scorn'd him; and turning to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, <HI>Sir,</HI> says I, <HI>That those Jewels were be∣longing to Mr.—, the</HI> English <HI>Jeweller,</HI> nam∣ing his Name readily, <HI>in that,</HI> says I, <HI>this Person is right, but that I should be questioned</HI> how I came to have them, <HI>is a Token of his Ignorance; which,</HI> however, <HI>he might have manag'd with a little more good Manners, till I had told him who I am; and both he and you too will be more easy in that Part, when I should tell you that I am the unhappy Widow of that Mr.—, who was so bar∣barously murdered going to</HI> Versailles; <HI>and that he was not robb'd of those Jewels, but of others; Mr.—having left those behind him with me, lest he should be robb'd; had I,</HI> Sir, <HI>come otherwise by them, I should not have been weak enough to have exposed them to Sale here, where the Thing was done, but have carried them far∣ther off.</HI></P>
<P>This was an agreeable Surprise to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer∣chant, who being an honest Man himself, believed e∣very Thing I said, which indeed being all really and literally true, except the Deficiency of my Marriage,
<PB N="123" REF="121"/>
I spoke with such an unconcerned Easiness, that it might plainly be seen that I had no Guilt upon me, as the <HI>Jew</HI> suggested.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> was confounded when he heard that I was the <HI>Jeweller's</HI> Wife; but as I had raised his Passion, with saying he look'd at me with a Devil's Face, he studied Mischief in his Heart, and answer'd, <HI>That should not serve my Turn;</HI> so called the <HI>Dutchman</HI> out again, when he told him that he resolved to prosecute this Mat∣ter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind Chance in this Affair, which indeed, was my Deliverance, and that was, that the Fool could not restrain his Passion, but must let it fly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; to whom, when they withdrew a second Time, as above, he told that he would bring a Process against me for the Murther; and that it should cost me dear, for using him at that rate; and <HI>away he went,</HI> desiring the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant to tell him when I wou'd be there again: Had he suspected that the <HI>Dutch∣man</HI> wou'd have communicated the Particulars to me, he wou'd never have been so foolish as to have men∣tion'd that Part to him,</P>
<P>But the Malice of his Thoughts anticipated him, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant was so good, as to give me an Account of his Design, which indeed was wicked enough in its Nature; but to me it would have been worse, than otherwise it wou'd to another; for upon Examination, I cou'd not have prov'd myself to be the Wise of the Jeweller, so the Suspicion might have been carried on with the better Face; and then I shou'd also have brought all his Relations in <HI>England</HI> upon me; who finding by the Proceedings, that I was not his Wife, but a Mistress, or in <HI>English,</HI> a Whore, wou'd immediately have laid Claim to the Jewels, as I had own'd them to be his.</P>
<P>This Thought immediately rush'd into my Head, as soon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant had told me, what wicked Things were in the Head of that cursed <HI>Jew;</HI> and the Villain (for so I must call him) convinc'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant that he was in earnest, by an Expres∣sion
<PB N="124" REF="122"/>
which shewed the rest of his Design, and that was a Plot to get the rest of the Jewels into his Hand.</P>
<P>When first he hinted to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> that the Jew∣els were such a Man's, meaning my Husband's, he made wonderful Explanations on Account of their having been concealed so long; where must they have lain? And what was the Woman that brought them? And that she, meaning me, ought to be immediately apprehended, and put into the Hands of Justice; and this was the Time that, as I said, he made such horrid Gestures, and look'd at me so like a Devil.</P>
<P>The Merchant hearing him talk at that Rate, and seeing him in earnest, said to him, Hold your Tongue a little, this is a Thing of Consequence; if it be so, let you and I go into the next Room and consider of it there; and so they withdrew, and left me.</P>
<P>Here, as before, I was uneasy, and called him out, and having heard how it was, gave him that Answer, <HI>that I was his Wife,</HI> or Widow, which the malicious <HI>Jew</HI> said <HI>should not serve my Turn;</HI> and then it was, that the <HI>Dutchman</HI> called him out again; and in this Time of his withdrawing, the Merchant finding, as a∣bove, that he was really in earnest, counterfeited a little to be of his Mind, and entered into Proposals with him for the Thing itself.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an Advocate or Council, for Directions how to proceed, and to meet again the next Day, against which Time the Merchant was to ap∣point me to come again with the Jewels, in Order to sell them: <HI>No,</HI> says the Merchant, <HI>I will go farther with her than so; I will desire her to leave the Jewels with me, to shew to another Person, in order to get the better Price for them: That's right,</HI> says the <HI>Jew, and I'll engage she shall never be Mistress of them again; they shall either be seiz'd by us,</HI> says he, <HI>in the King's Name, or she shall be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put to the Torture.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant said Yes to every Thing he offered, and they agreed to meet the next Morning about it, and I was to be perswaded to leave the Jewels with him, and come to them the next Day at four o'Clock, in or∣der
<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
to make a good Bargain for them, and on these Con∣ditions they parted; but the honest <HI>Dutchman,</HI> fill'd with Indignation at the barbarous Design, came directly to me, and told me the whole Story; <HI>and now, Madam,</HI> says he, <HI>you are to consider immediately what you have to do.</HI></P>
<P>I told him if I was sure to have Justice I would not fear all that such a Rogue could do to me; but how such Things were carried on in <HI>France</HI> I knew not. I told him the greatest Difficulty would be to prove our Marriage, for that it was done in <HI>England,</HI> and in a remote Part of <HI>England</HI> too, and which was worse, it would be hard to produce authentic Vouchers of it, because we were mar∣ried in Private: <HI>But as to the Death of your Husband, Madam, what can be said to that?</HI> said he; <HI>Nay,</HI> said I, <HI>what can they say to it?</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> added I, if they would offer such an Injury to any one, they must prove the Fact, or give just Reason for their Suspicions; that my Husband was murdered, that every one knows; but that he was robb'd, or of what, or how much, that none knows, no, not myself; and why was I not question'd for it then? I have liv'd in <HI>Paris</HI> ever since, liv'd publickly, and no Man had yet the Impudence to suggest such a Thing of me.</P>
<P>I am fully satisfied of that, <HI>says the Merchant;</HI> but as this is a Rogue, who will stick at nothing, what can we say? And who knows what he may swear? Suppose he should swear that he knows your Husband had those particular Jewels with him the Morning when he went out, and that he shewed them to him, to consider their Value, and what Price he should ask the Prince <HI>de—</HI>for them.</P>
<P>Nay, by the same Rule, <HI>said I,</HI> he may swear, that I murder'd my Husband, if he finds it for his Turn: That's true, said he; and if he shou'd, I do not see what cou'd save you; but, added he, I have found out his more immediate Design; his Design is to have you carried to the <HI>Chatellette,</HI> that the Suspicion may appear just; and then to get the Jewels out of your Hands, if possible; then, at last, to drop the Prosecution, on your consenting to quit the Jewels to him; and how
<PB N="126" REF="124"/>
you will do to avoid this, is the Question, which I would have you consider of.</P>
<P>My Misfortune, Sir, said I, is, that I have no Time to consider, and I have no Person to consider with, or ad∣vise about it; I find, that Innocence may be oppress'd by such an impudent Fellow as this; he that does not value a Perjury, has any Man's Life at his Mercy; but Sir, said I, is the Justice such here, that while I may be in the Hands of the Publick, and under Prosecution, he may get hold of my Effects, and get my Jewels into his Hands?</P>
<P>I don't know, says he, what may be done in that Case; but if not he, if the Court of Justice shou'd get hold of them, I do not know but you may find it as difficult to get them out of their Hands again, and, at least, it may cost you half as much as they are worth; so I think it would be a much better Way, to prevent their coming at them at all.</P>
<P>But what Course can I take to do that, says I, now they have got Notice that I have them? If they get me into their Hands, they will oblige me to produce them, or perhaps, sentence me to Prison till I do.</P>
<P>Nay, says he, as this Brute says too, put you to the Question, that is to the Torture, on Pretence of making you confess who were the Murderers of your Husband.</P>
<P>Confess! said I, how can I confess what I know no∣thing of?</P>
<P>If they come to have you to the Rack, said he, they will make you confess you did it yourself, whether you did it or no, and then you are cast.</P>
<P>The very Word Rack frighted me to Death almost, and I had no Spirit left in me: Did it myself! said I; that's impossible!</P>
<P>No, Madam, says he, 'tis far from impossible; the most innocent People in the World have been forc'd to confess themselves Guilty of what they never heard of, much less, had any Hand in.</P>
<P>What then must I do? said I; what wou'd you advise me to.</P>
<P>Why, says he, I wou'd advise you to be gone; you intended to go away in four or five Days, and you may
<PB N="127" REF="125"/>
as well go in two Days; and if you can do so, I shall manage it so, that he shall not suspect your being gone for several Days after: Then he told me how the Rogue would have me ordered to bring the Jewels the next Day for Sale; and that then he would have me apprehended; how he made the <HI>Jew</HI> believe he would join with him in his Design, and that he [the Merchant] would get the Jewels into his Hands. Now, <HI>says the Merchant,</HI> I shall give you Bills for the Money you desir'd immediately, and such as shall not fail of being paid; take your Jew∣els with you, and go this very Evening to St. <HI>Germains on Lay,</HI> I'll send a Man thither with you, and from thence he shall guide you to morrow to <HI>Roan,</HI> where there lies a Ship of mine just ready to sail for <HI>Rotter∣dam;</HI> you shall have your Passage in that Ship on my Account, and I will send Orders for him to sail as soon as you are on Board, and a Letter to my Friend at <HI>Rot∣terdam</HI> to entertain and take Care of you.</P>
<P>This was too kind an Offer for me, as Things stood, not to be accepted and be thankful for; and as to going away I had prepared every Thing for parting, so that I had little to do but to go back, to take two or three Boxes and Bundles and such Things, and my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and be gone.</P>
<P>Then the Merchant told me the Measures he had re∣solyed to take to delude the <HI>Jew,</HI> while I made my Es∣cape, which were very well contriv'd indeed. FIRST, <HI>said he,</HI> when he comes to morrow I shall tell him that I pro∣posed to you to leave the Jewels with me, as we agreed, but that you said you would come and bring them in the Afternoon, so that we must stay for you till four o'Clock; but then, at that Time, I will shew a Letter from you, as if just come in, wherein you shall excuse your not coming, for that some Company came to visit you, and prevented you; but that you desire me to take Care that the Gentleman be ready to buy your Jewels; and that you will come to morrow at the same Hour, without fail.</P>
<P>When to morrow is come, we shall wait at the Time, but you not appearing, I shall seem most dissatisfied, and wonder what can be the Reason, and so we shall agree
<PB N="128" REF="126"/>
to go the next Day to get out a Process against you; but the next Day in the Morning I will send to give him Notice that you have been at my House, but he not be∣ing there have made another Appointment, and that I desire to speak with him; when he comes, I'll tell him you appear perfectly blind as to your Danger, and that you appeared much disappointed that he did not come, tho' you could not meet the Night before; and oblig'd me to have him here at three o' Clock; <HI>When to mor∣row comes,</HI> says he, <HI>you shall send Word that you are taken so ill that you cannot come out for that Day, but that you will not fail the next, and the next Day you shall neither come send, nor let us ever hear any more of you; for by that Time you shall be in</HI> Holland, <HI>if you please.</HI></P>
<P>I could not but approve all his Measures, seeing they were so well contriv'd, and in so friendly a Manner, for my Benefit; and as he seem'd to be so very sincere, I resolv'd to put my Life in his Hands. Immediately I went to my Lodgings, and sent away <HI>Amy</HI> with such Bundles as I had prepared for my Travelling; I also sent several Parcels of my fine Furniture to the Mer∣chant's House to be laid up for me, and bringing the Key of the Lodgings with me, I came back to his House. Here we finished our Matters of Money, and I deliver∣ed into his Hand seven thousand eight hundred Pistoles in Bills and Money, a Copy of an Assignment on the Town-House of <HI>Paris</HI> for 4000 Pistoles at 3 per <HI>Cent.</HI> Interest attested, and a Procuration for receiving the In∣terest half-yearly; but the Original I kept myself.</P>
<P>I could have trusted all I had with him, for he was perfectly honest, and had not the least View of doing me any Wrong; indeed after it was so apparent that he had, as it were, sav'd my Life, or at least, sav'd me from being exposed and ruin'd; I say, after this how could I doubt him in any Thing?</P>
<P>When I came to him, he had every Thing ready I wanted, and as he had proposed; as to my Money, he gave me first of all an accepted Bill, payable at <HI>Rotter∣dam,</HI> for 4000 Pistoles, and drawn from <HI>Genoa</HI> upon a Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> payable to a Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="127"/>
and endors'd by him to my Merchant; this he assur'd me wou'd be punctually paid, and so it was, to a Day; the rest I had in other Bills of Exchange, drawn by himself upon other Merchants in <HI>Holland:</HI> Having se∣cur'd my Jewels too, as well as I cou'd, he sent me away the same Evening in a Friend's Coach, which he had procur'd for me, to <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and the next Morning to <HI>Roan;</HI> he also sent a Servant of his own, on Horseback, with me, who provided every Thing for me, and who carried his Orders to the Captain of the Ship, which lay about three Miles below <HI>Roan,</HI> in the River, and by his Directions I went immediately on Board: The third Day after I was on Board, the Ship went away, and we were out at Sea the next Day after that; and thus I took my Leave of <HI>France,</HI> and got clear of an ugly Business, which, had it gone on, might have ruin'd me, and sent me back as naked to <HI>England,</HI> as I was a little before I left it.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Amy</HI> and I were at Leisure to look upon the Mischiefs that we had escap'd; and had I had any Re∣ligion, or any Sense of a supreme Power managing, di∣recting, and governing in both Causes and Events in this World, such a Case as this wou'd have given any body Room to have been very thankful to the Power who had not only put such a Treasure into my Hand, but given me such an Escape from the Ruin that threatned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne; but I had none of those Things about me; I had indeed, a grateful Sense upon my Mind of the generous Friendship of my Deliverer, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, by whom I was so faithfully serv'd, and by whom, as far <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s relates to second Causes, I was preserv'd from De∣struction.</P>
<P>I say, I had a grateful Sense upon my Mind, of his Kindness and Faithfulness to me, and I resolv'd to show him some Testimony of it, as soon as I came to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of my Rambles, for I was yet but in a State of Un∣certainty, and sometimes that gave me a little Uneasi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess too. I had Paper indeed for my Money, and he had shew'd himself very good to me, in conveying me way, as above; but I had not seen the End of Things
<PB N="130" REF="128"/>
yet; for unless the Bills were paid, I might still be a great Loser by my <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and he might, perhaps, have contriv'd all that Affair of the <HI>Jew,</HI> to put me into a Fright, and get me to run away, and that, as if it were to save my Life; that if the Bills should be refus'd, I was cheated with a Witness, and the like; but these were but Surmises, and indeed, were perfect∣ly without Cause; for the honest Man acted as honest Men always do, with an upright and disinterested Prin∣ciple, and with a Sincerity not often to be found in the World; what Gain he made by the Exchange, was just, and was nothing but what was his Due, and was in the Way of his Business; but otherwise he made no Advantage of me at all.</P>
<P>When I pass'd in the Ship between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calois,</HI> and saw beloved <HI>England</HI> once more under my View; <HI>England,</HI> which I counted my native Country, being the Place I was bred up in, tho' not born there; a strange kind of Joy possess'd my Mind, and I had such a longing Desire to be there, that I wou'd have given the Master of the Ship twenty Pistoles to have stood over, and set me on Shore in the <HI>Downs;</HI> and when he told me he could not do it, that is, that he durst not do it, if I wou'd have given him an hundred Pistoles, I secretly wish'd, that a Storm wou'd rise, that might drive the Ship over to the Coast of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> whether they wou'd or not, that I that I might be set on Shore any where upon <HI>English</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>This wicked Wish had not been out of my Thoughts above two or three Hours, but the Master steering away to the <HI>North,</HI> as was his Course to do, we lost Sight of Land on that Side, and only had the <HI>Flemish</HI> Shore in View on our Right-hand, or, as the Seamen call it, the Starboard-Side; and then with the Loss of the Sight, the Wish for Landing in <HI>England,</HI> abated; and I con∣sider'd how foolish it was to wish myself out of the Way of my Business; that if I had been on Shore in <HI>England,</HI> I must go back to <HI>Holland,</HI> on Account of my Bills, which were so considerable, and I having no

Correspondence there, that I cou'd not have manag'd it, without going myself: But we had not been out of Sight of <HI>England</HI> many Hours, before the Weather be∣gan to change, the Winds whistl'd, and made a Noise, and the Seamen said to one another, that it wou'd blow hard at Night: It was then about two Hours be∣fore Sun-set, and we were pass'd by <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and I think they said we were in Sight of <HI>Ostend;</HI> but then the Wind grew high, and the Sea swell'd, and all Things look'd terrible, especially to us, that under∣stood nothing but just what we saw before us; in short, Night came on, and very dark it was, the Wind fresh∣en'd, and blew harder and harder, and about two Hours within Night, it blew a terrible Storm.</P>
<P>I was not quite a Stranger to the Sea, having come from <HI>Rochelle</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> when I was a Child, and gone from <HI>London,</HI> by the River <HI>Thames,</HI> to <HI>France</HI> af∣terward, as I have said: But I began to be alarm'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> little with the terrible Clamour of the Men over my Head, for I had never been in a Storm, and so had ne∣ver seen the like, or heard it; and once, offering to look out at the Door of the Steerage, as they call'd it, it struck me with such Horror, the Darkness, the Fierce∣ness of the Wind, the dreadful Height of the Waves, and the Hurry the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailors were in, whose Lan∣guage I did not understand one Word of, neither when they curs'd, or when they pray'd; I say, all these Things together, fill'd me with Terror; and, in short, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the great Cabbin there sat <HI>Amy,</HI> who was very Sea-sick, and I had a little be∣fore given her a Sup of Cordial waters, to help her Sto∣mach: When <HI>Amy</HI> saw me come back, and si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down without speaking, for so I did, she look'd two or three Times up at me; at last she came running to me, Dear Madam! says she, what is the Matter? what makes you look so pale? why, you a'nt well, what is the Matter? I said nothing still, but held up my Hands two or three Times. <HI>Amy</HI> doubled her importunities; upon that, I said no more, but, <HI>step to the Steerage Door,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="130"/>
<HI>and look out, as I did;</HI> so she went away immediately, and look'd too, as I had bidden her; but the poor Girl came back again in the greatest Amazement and Hor∣ror, that ever I saw any poor Creature in, wringing her Hands, and crying out she was undone! she was undone! she should be drown'd! they were all lost! Thus she ran about the Cabbin like a mad Thing, and as perfectly out of her Senses, as any one in such a Case cou'd be suppos'd to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted myself; but when I saw the Girl in such a terrible Agony, it brought me a little to myself, and I began to talk to her, and put her in a little Hope; I told her, there was many a Ship in a Storm, that was not cast away; and I hop'd we should not be drown'd; that it was true, the Storm was very dreadful, but I did not see that the Seamen were so much con∣cern'd as we were; and so I talk'd to her as well as I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, tho' my Heart was full enough of it, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and Death began to stare in my Face, ay, and something else too, that is to say, Conscience, and my Mind was very much disturb'd, but I had no body to comfort me.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> being in so much worse a Condition, that is to say, so much more terrify'd at the Storm, than I was, I had something to do to comfort her; she was, as I have said, like one distracted, and went raving about the Cabbin, crying out she was undone! undone! she shou'd be drown'd, and the like; and at last, the Ship giving a Jerk, by the Force, I suppose, of some violent Wave, it threw poor <HI>Amy</HI> quite down, for she was weak enough before with being Sea-sick, and as it threw her forward, the poor Girl struck her Head against the Bulk-head, as the Seamen call it, of the Cabbin, and laid her as dead as a Stone, upon the Floor, or Deck, that is to say, she was so to all Ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>I cry'd out for Help; but it had been all one to have cry'd out on the Top of a Mountain, where no∣body had been within five Miles of me; for the Sea∣men were so engag'd, and made so much Noise, that
<PB N="133" REF="131"/>
no body heard me or came near me. I open'd the Great-Cabbin Door, and look'd into the Steerage, to cry for Help, but there, to encrease my Fright, was two Sea∣men on their Knees, at Prayers, and only one Man who steer'd, and he made a groaning Noise too, which I took to be saying his Prayers, but it seems it was an∣swering to those above, when they call'd to him to tell him which Way to steer</P>
<P>Here was no Help for me, or for poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and there she lay still so, and in luch a Condition, that I did not know whether she was dead or alive. In this Fright I went to her, and lifted her a little way up, setting her on the Deck with her Back to the Boards of the Bulk-head, and I got a little Bottle out of my Pocket, and I held it to her Nose, and rubb'd her Temples, and what else I could do, but still <HI>Amy</HI> shew'd no Signs of Life, till I felt for her Pulse, but could hardly distinguish her to be alive; however, after a great while, she began to revive, and in about half an Hour she came to herself but remember'd nothing at first of what had happen'd to her, for a good while more.</P>
<P>When she recover'd more fully, she ask'd me where she was? I told her, she was in the Ship yet, but God knows how long it might be; Why, Madam, says she, is not the Storm over? <HI>No, no,</HI> says I, <HI>Amy; why, Madam,</HI> says she, <HI>it was calm just now,</HI> (meaning when she was in the swooning Fit, occasion'd by her Fall) <HI>Calm,</HI> Amy, <HI>says I, 'tis far from being calm; it may be calm by and by, when we are all drown'd, and gone to</HI> HEAVEN.</P>
<P>HEAVEN! Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> what makes you talk so? HEAVEN! I go to HEAVEN! <HI>No, no,</HI> if I am drown'd, I am damn'd! <HI>Don't you know what a wicked Creature I have been?</HI> I have been a Whore to two Men, and have liv'd a wretched abominable Life of Vice and Wickedness for fourteen Years; <HI>O</HI> Madam, <HI>you know it,</HI> and GOD knows it; and now <HI>I am to die; to be drown'd; O!</HI> what will become of me? <HI>I am un∣done for ever!</HI> ay, Madam, <HI>for ever! to all Eternity!</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="132"/>
<HI>O I am lost! I am lost! if I am drown'd, I am lost for ever!</HI></P>
<P>All these, you will easily suppose, must be so many Stabs into the very Soul of one in my own Case; it immediately occur'd to me, <HI>poor</HI> Amy! <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> art thou, that I am not?</HI> what hast thou been, that I have not been? Nay, I am guilty of my own Sin, and thine too: Then it came to my Remembrance, that I had not only been the same with <HI>Amy,</HI> but that I had been the Devil's Instrument, to make her wicked; that I had stripp'd her, and prostituted her to the very Man that I had been naught with myself; that she had but follow'd me; I had been her wicked Example; and I had led her into all; and that as we had sinn'd toge∣ther, now we were likely to sink together.</P>
<P>All this repeated itself to my Thoughts at that very Moment; and every one of <HI>Amy</HI>'s Cries sounded thus in my Ears: I am the wicked Cause of it all; I have been thy Ruin, <HI>Amy,</HI> I have brought thee to this, and now thou art to suffer for the Sin I have entic'd thee to; and if thou art lost for ever, <HI>what must I be?</HI> what must be my Portion?</P>
<P>It is true, this Difference was between us, that I said all these Things within myself, and sigh'd, and mourn∣ed inwardly; but <HI>Amy,</HI> as her Temper was more vio∣lent, spoke aloud, and cry'd, and call'd out aloud, like one in an Agony,</P>
<P>I had but small Encouragement to give her, and in∣deed, cou'd say but very little; but I got her to com∣pose herself a little, and not let any of the People of the Ship understand what she meant, or what she said; but even in her greatest Composure, she continued to express herself with the utmost Dread and Terror, on Account of the wicked Life she had liv'd; and crying out, she should be damn'd, and the like; which was very terrible to me, who knew what Condition I was in myself.</P>
<P>Upon these serious Considerations, I was very peni∣tent too, for my former Sins, and cry'd out, tho' soft∣ly, two or three Times, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me;</HI> to
<PB N="135" REF="133"/>
this, I added abundance of Resolutions, of what a Life I would live, if it should please God but to spare my Life but this one Time; how I would live a single and a virtuous Life, and spend a great deal of what I had thus wickedly got, in Acts of Charity, and doing Good.</P>
<P>Under these dreadful Apprehensions, I look'd back on the Life I had led with the utmost Contempt and Abhorrence. I blush'd, and wonder'd at myself, how I cou'd act thus; how I cou'd divest myself of Modesty and Honour, and prostitute myself for Gain; and I thought, if ever it should please God to spare me this one Time from Death, it wou'd not be possible that I should be the same Creature again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> went farther; she pray'd, she resolv'd, she vow'd to lead a new Life, if God wou'd spare her but this Time; It now began to be Day-light, for the Storm held all Night long, and it was some Comfort to see the Light of another Day, which indeed, none of us expected; but the Sea went Mountains high, and the Noise of the Water was as frightful to us, as the Sight of the Waves; nor was any Land to be seen, nor did the Seamen know whereabout they were. At last, to our great Joy, they made Land, which was in <HI>England,</HI> and on the Coast of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and the Ship be∣ing in the utmost Distress, they ran for the Shore, at all Hazards, and with great Difficulty, got into <HI>Har∣wich,</HI> where they were safe, as to the Danger of Death; but the Ship was so full of Water, and so much damag∣ed, that if they had not laid her on Shore the same Day, she wou'd have sunk before Night, according to the Opinion of the Seamen, and of the Workmen on Shore too, who were hir'd to assist them in stopping their Leaks.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was reviv'd as soon as she heard they had espy'd Land, and went out upon the Deck, but soon came in again to me, <HI>O Madam,</HI> says she, <HI>there's the Land in∣deed, to be seen, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooks like a Ridge of Clouds, and may be all a Cloud for ought I know, but if it be Land, 'tis a great Way off; and the Sea is in such a Combustion, we</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="134"/>
<HI>shall all perish before we can reach it; 'tis the dreadfullest Sight to look at the Waves, that ever was seen,</HI> why, <HI>they are as high as Mountains, we shall certainly be all swallow'd up, for all the Land is so near.</HI></P>
<P>I had conceiv'd some Hope, that if they saw Land, we should be deliver'd; and I told her, she did not un∣derstand Things of that Nature; that she might be sure if they saw Land, they would go directly towards it, and wou'd make into some Harbour, but it was, as <HI>Amy</HI> said, a frightful Distance to it: The Land look'd like Clouds, and the Sea went as high as Mountains, so that no Hope appear'd in the seeing the Land; but we were in Fear of Foundring, before we cou'd reach it; this made <HI>Amy</HI> so desponding still; but as the Wind, which blew from the East, or that Way, drove us furiously towards the Land; so when, about half an Hour after, I stept to the Steerage-door, and look'd out, I saw the Land much nearer than <HI>Amy</HI> represented it; so I went in, and encourag'd <HI>Amy</HI> again, and in∣deed was encourag'd myself.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, or something more, we see, to our infinite Satisfaction, the open Harbour of <HI>Harwich,</HI> and the Vessel standing directly towards it, and in a few Minutes more, the Ship was in smooth Water, to our inexpressible Comfort; and thus I had, tho' a∣gainst my Will, and contrary to my true Interest, what I wish'd for, to be driven away to <HI>England,</HI> though it was by a Storm.</P>
<P>Nor did this Incident do either <HI>Amy</HI> or me much Ser∣vice; for the Danger being over, the Fears of Death vanish'd with it; ay, and our Fear of what was be∣yond Death also; our Sense of the Life we had liv'd went off, and with our return to Life, our wicked Taste of Life return'd, and we were both the same as before, if not worse: So certain it is, that the Repen∣tance which is brought about by the meer Apprehen∣sions of Death, wears off as those Apprehensions wear off; and Death-bed Repentance, or Storm-Repentance, which is much the same, is seldom true.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="135"/>
However, I do not tell you that this was all at once neither; the Fright we had at Sea lasted a little while afterwards, at least, the Impression was not quite blown off as soon as the Storm; especially poor <HI>Amy,</HI> as soon as she set her Foot on Shore, she fell flat upon the Ground and kiss'd it, and gave God Thanks for her Deliver∣ance from the Sea; and turning to me when she got up, I hope, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> you will never go upon the Sea again.</P>
<P>I know not what ail'd me, not I; but <HI>Amy</HI> was much more penitent at Sea, and much more sensible of her Deliverance when she landed, and was safe, than I was; I was in a kind of Stupidity, I know not well what to call it; I had a Mind full of Horror in the Time of the Storm, and saw Death before me as plainly as <HI>Amy,</HI> but my Thoughts got no Vent, as <HI>Amy</HI>'s did; I had a silent sullen kind of Grief, which could not break out either in Words or Tears, and which was therefore much the worse to bear.</P>
<P>I had a Terror upon me for my wicked Life past, and firmly believed I was going to the Bottom, launching into Death, where I was to give an Account of all my past Actions; and in this State and on that Account, I look'd back upon my Wickedness with Abhorrence, as I have said above; but I had no Sense of Repentance, from the true Motive of Repentance, I saw nothing of the Cor∣ruption of Nature, the Sin of my Life, as an Offence against God, as a Thing odious to the Holiness of his Being, as a∣basing his Mercy, and despising his Goodness; in short, I had no thorow effectual Repentance, no Sight of my Sins in their proper Shape, no View of a Redeemer, or Hope in him: I had only such a Repentance as a Criminal has at the Place of Execution, who is sorry, not that he has com∣mitted the Crime, as it is a Crime, but sorry <HI>that he is to be hang'd for it.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Amy</HI>'s Repentance wore off too, as well as mine, but not so soon; however, we were both very grave for a Time.</P>
<P>As soon as we could get a Boat from the Town, we went on Shore, and immediately went to a Public-house in the Town of <HI>Harwich;</HI> where we were to consider
<PB N="138" REF="136"/>
seriously what was to be done, and whether we should go up to <HI>London,</HI> or stay till the Ship was refitted, which, they said, would be a Fortnight, and then go for <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> as we intended, and as Business required.</P>
<P>Reason directed that I should go to <HI>Holland,</HI> for there I had all my Money to receive, and there I had Persons of good Reputation and Character to apply to, having Letters to them from the honest <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant at <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> and they might perhaps give me a Recommendati∣on again to Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> and so I should get ac∣quainted with some People of Figure, which was what I loved; whereas now I knew not one Creature in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> or any where else, that I could go and make myself known to: Upon these Considera∣tions, I resolved to go to <HI>Holland</HI> whatever came on it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd and trembled, and was ready to fall into Fits, when I did but mention going upon the Sea again, and begg'd of me not to go, or if I would go, that I would leave her behind, tho' I was to send her a begging. The People in the Inn laugh'd at her, and jested with her, ask'd her if she had any Sins to con∣fess, that she was asham'd should be heard of? And that she was troubled with an evil Conscience; told her if she came to Sea, and to be in a Storm, if she had lain with her Master, she would certainly tell her Mistress of it; and that it was a common Thing for poor Maids to con∣fess all the young Men they had lain with; that there was one poor Girl that went over with her Mistress, whose Husband was a—r, in—, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> who confess'd, in the Terror of a Storm, that she had lain with her Master and all the Apprentices so often, and in such and such Places, and made the poor Mistress, when she return'd to <HI>London,</HI> fly at her Hus∣band, and make such a Stir as was indeed the Ruin of the whole Family. <HI>Amy</HI> could bear all that well enough; for tho' she had indeed lain with her Master, it was with her Mistress's Knowledge and Consent, and which was worse, was her Mistress's own doing. <HI>I record it to the Reproach of my own Vice,</HI> and to expose the Excesses of such Wickedness, as they deserve to be exposed.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="137"/>
I thought <HI>Amy</HI>'s Fear would have been over by that Time the Ship would be gotten ready, but I found the Girl was rather worse and worse; and when I came to the Point that we must go on Board or lose the Passage, <HI>Amy</HI> was so terrified that she fell into Fits, so the Ship went away without us.</P>
<P>But my going being absolutely necessary, as above, I was obliged to go in the Packet-Boat some time after, and leave <HI>Amy</HI> behind at <HI>Harwich,</HI> but with Directions to go to <HI>London,</HI> and stay there to receive Letters and Orders from me what to do. Now I was become from a Lady of Pleasure a Woman of Business, and of great Business too, I assure you.</P>
<P>I got me a Servant at <HI>Harwich</HI> to go over with me, who had been at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> knew the Place and spoke the Language, which was a great Help to me, and a∣way I went. I had a very quick Passage and pleasant Weather, and coming to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> soon found out the Merchant to whom I was recommended, who received me with extraordinary Respect; and first he acknow∣ledged the accepted Bill for 4000 Pistoles, which he af∣terwards paid punctually; other Bills that I had also pay∣able at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the Bills for a thousand two hundred Crowns was protested at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he paid it me him∣self, for the Honour of the Endorser, as he call'd it, which was my Friend, the Merchant at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>There I entered into a Negociation by his Means for my Jewels, and he brought me several Jewellers to look <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them, and particularly one to value them, and to tell me what every Particular was worth: This was a Man who had great Skill in Jewels, but did not trade at that Time, and he was desired by the Gentleman that I was with, to see that I might not be imposed upon.</P>
<P>All this Work took me up near half a Year, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anaging my Business thus myself, and having large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ums to do with, I became as expert in it as any She-Merchant of them all; I had Credit in the Bank for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rge Sum of Money, and Bills and Notes for much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="138"/>
After I had been here about three Months, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> writes me Word, that she had received a Letter from her Friend, as she called him, that, <HI>by the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> was the Prince's Gentleman, that had been <HI>Amy</HI>'s extra∣ordinary Friend indeed; for <HI>Amy</HI> owned to me he had lain with her a hundred Times, that is to say, as often as he pleased; and perhaps in the eight Years which that Affair lasted, it might be a great deal oftner: T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s was what she called her Friend, whom she corresponded with upon this particular Subject; and among other Things sent her this particular News, that my extra∣ordinary Friend my real Husband, who rode in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>d'arms,</HI> was dead, that he was killed in a Rencounter, as they call it, or accidental Scuffle among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and so the Jade congratulated me upon my being now a real free Woman; and now, Madam, <HI>says <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, at the End of her Letter,</HI> you have nothing to do but to come hither and set up a Coach, and a good Equipage, and if Beauty and a good Fortune won't make you a Dutchess, nothing will; <HI>but I had not fix'd my Mea∣sures as yet.</HI> I had no Inclination to be a Wife again, I had had such bad Luck with my first Husband, I hated the Thoughts of it. I found that a Wife is treated with Indifference, a Mistress with a strong Passion; a Wife is look'd upon as but an Upper-servant, a Mistress is a So∣vereign; a Wife must give up all she has, have every Reserve she makes for herself be thought hard of, and be upbraided with her very Pin-money; whereas a Mi∣stress makes the Saying true, <HI>that what the Man has,</HI> is hers, and <HI>what she has,</HI> is her own; the Wife bears a thousand Insults, and is forc'd to sit still and bear it, or part and be undone; a Mistress insulted helps herself im∣mediately, and takes another.</P>
<P>These were my wicked Arguments for Whoring, for I never set against them the Difference another Way, I may say, every other Way; <HI>how that,</HI> FIRST, A Wife appears boldly and honourably with her Husband, lives at Home and possesses his House, his Servants, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> S∣quipages, and has a Right to them all, and to call them her own; entertains his Friends, owns his Children, and has the Return of Duty and Affection from them, as
<PB N="141" REF="139"/>
they are here her own, and claims upon his Estate, by the Custom of <HI>England,</HI> if he dies and leaves her a Wi∣dow.</P>
<P>The Whore sculks about in Lodgings, is visited in the dark; disown'd upon all Occasions before God and Man; is maintain'd indeed, for a Time, but is certain∣ly condemn'd to be abandon'd at last, and left to the Miseries of Fate, and her own just Disaster: If she has any Children, her Endeavour is to get rid of them, and not maintain them; and if she lives, she is certain to see them all hate her, and be ashamed of her; while the Vice rages, and the Man is in the Devil's Hand, <HI>she has him;</HI> and while she has him, she makes <HI>a Prey of him;</HI> but if he happens to fall sick, if any Disaster befals him, the Cause of all lies upon her; he is sure to lay all his Misfortunes at her Door; and if once he comes to Re∣pentance, or makes but one Step towards a Reformation, he begins with her, leaves her, uses her as she deserves, hates her, abhors her, and <HI>sees her no more;</HI> and that with this never-failing Addition, namely, That the more sincere and unfeigned his Repentance is, the more earn∣estly he looks up, and the more effectually he looks in, the more his Aversion to her encreases, and he curses her from the Bottom of his Soul; nay, it must be from a kind of Excess of Charity, if he so much as wishes God may forgive her.</P>
<P>The opposite Circumstances of a <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Whore,</HI> are such and so many, and I have since seen the Difference with such Eyes as I could dwell upon the Subject a great while, but my Business is History; I had a long Scene of Folly yet to run over; perhaps the Moral of all my Story may bring me back again to this Part, and if it does, I shall speak of it fully.</P>
<P>While I continued in <HI>Holland</HI> I received several Letters from my Friend, (so I had good Reason to call him) the Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> in which he gave me a farther Ac∣count of the Conduct of that Rogue, the <HI>Jew,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow he acted after I was gone; how impatient he was while the said Merchant kept him in Suspense, expecting we to come again; and how he raged when he found came no more.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="140"/>
It seems, after he found I did not come, he found out by his unwearied Enquiry, where I had lived; and that I had been kept as a Mistress to some great Person, but he could never learn by whom, except that, he learnt the Colour of his Livery. In Pursuit of this Enquiry he guess'd at the right Person, but could not make it out, or offer any positive Proof of it; but he found out the Prince's Gentleman, and talked so saucily to him of it, that the Gentleman treated him, as the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>au Coup de Batton;</HI> that is to say, can'd him very se∣verely, as he deserv'd; and that not satisfying him, or curing his Insolence, he was met one Night late upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> by two Men, who mufling him up in a great Cloak, carried him into a more private Place, and cut off both his Ears, telling him, it was for talking impudently of his Superiors; adding that he should take Care to govern his Tongue better, and be∣have with more Manners, or the next Time they would cut his Tongue out of his Head.</P>
<P>This put a Check to his Sauciness that Way; but he comes back to the Merchant, and threatned to begin a Process against him, for corresponding with me, and being accessary to the Murder of the Jeweller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant found by his Discourse, that he sup∣posed I was protected by the said Prince <HI>de—,</HI> nay, the Rogue said, he was sure I was in his Lodgings at <HI>Versailles; for he never had so much as the least Intima∣tion of the Way I was really gone;</HI> but that I was there he was certain, and certain that the Merchant was pri∣vy to it. The Merchant bid him Defiance; however, he gave him a great deal of Trouble, and put him to a great Charge, and had like to have brought him in for a Party to my Escape, in which Case he would have been oblig'd to have produced me, and that in the Penalty of some capital Sum of Money.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was too many for him another Way; for he brought an Information against him for a Cheat; wherein laying down the whole Fact, how he intended falsly to accuse the Widow of the Jeweller for the sup∣posed Murther of her Husband; that he did it purely to get the Jewels from her; and that he offered to bring
<PB N="143" REF="141"/>
him <HI>[the Merchant]</HI> in, to be confederate with him, and to share the Jewels between them; proving also his De∣sign to get the Jewels into his Hands, and then to have drop'd the Prosecution, upon Condition of my quitting the Jewels to him. Upon this Charge he got him laid by the Heels, so he was sent to the <HI>Concergerie,</HI> that is to say, to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and the Merchant clear'd. He got out of Jail in a little while, tho' not without the Help of Money, and continued teizing the Merchant a long while, and at last threatned to assassinate and murder him; so the Merchant, who having buried his Wife a∣bout two Months before, was now a single Man, and not knowing what such a Villain might do, thought fit to quit <HI>Paris,</HI> and came away to <HI>Holland</HI> also.</P>
<P>It is most certain, that speaking of Originals, I was the Source and Spring of all that Trouble and Vexati∣on to this honest Gentleman; and as it was afterwards in my Power to have made him full Satisfaction, and did not, I cannot say but I added Ingratitude to all the rest of my Follies; but of that I shall give a fuller Ac∣count presently.</P>
<P>I was surprised one Morning, when being at the Mer∣chant's House, whom he had recommended me to in <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and being busy in his Compting-house, ma∣naging my Bills, and preparing to write a Letter to him to <HI>Paris,</HI> I heard a Noise of Horses at the Door, which is not very common in a City where every Body passes by Water; but he had, it seems, ferry'd over the <HI>Maez</HI> from <HI>Williamstadt,</HI> and so came to the very Door; and I looking towards the Door, upon hearing the Horses, saw a Gentleman alight and come in at the Gate. I knew nothing, and expected nothing to be sure of the Person; but, as I say, was surprized, and indeed, more than ordinarily surprized, when coming nearer to me, I saw it was my Merchant of <HI>Paris,</HI> my Benefactor, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed my Deliverer.</P>
<P>I confess it was an agreeable Surprize to me, and I was exceeding glad to see him, who was so honourable and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o kind to me, and who indeed had sav'd my Life. As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon as he saw me, he run to me, took me in his Arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd kiss'd me with a Freedom that he never offered to
<PB N="144" REF="142"/>
take with me before: <HI>Dear Madam—,</HI> says he, <HI>am glad to see you safe in this Country, if you had staid two Days longer in</HI> Paris <HI>you had been undone.</HI> I was so glad to see him, that I could not speak a good while, and I burst out into Tears without speaking a Word for a Minute, but I recovered that Disorder, and said, <HI>The more, Sir, is my Obligation to you that sav'd my Life;</HI> and added, <HI>I am glad to see you here, that I may consi∣der how to ballance an Account, in which I am so much your Debtor.</HI></P>
<P>You and I will adjust that Matter easily, <HI>says he,</HI> now we are so near together; pray where do you lodge? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>In a very honest good House, <HI>said I,</HI> where that Gentleman, your Friend, recommended me, pointing to the Merchant in whose House we then were.</P>
<P>And where you may lodge too, Sir, <HI>says the Gentle∣man,</HI> if it suits with your Business, and your other Con∣veniency.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, <HI>says he;</HI> then Madam, <HI>adds he,</HI> turning to me, I shall be near you, and have Time to tell you a Story, which will be very long, and yet ma∣ny Ways very pleasant to you, how troublesome that devilish Fellow, the <HI>Jew,</HI> has been to me on your Ac∣count, and what a hellish Snare he had laid for you, if he could have found you.</P>
<P>I shall have Leisure too, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> to tell you all my Adventures since that; which have not been a few, I assure you.</P>
<P>In short, he took up his Lodgings in the same House where I lodg'd, and the Room he lay in opened. as he was wishing it would, just opposite to my Lodging∣room, so we could almost call out of Bed to one another, and I was not at all shy of him on that Score, for I be∣lieved him perfectly honest, and so indeed he was; and if he had not, that Article was at present no Part of my Concern.</P>
<P>It was not till two or three Days, and after his first Hurries of Business were over, that we began to enter into the History of our Affairs on every Side, but when we began, it took up all our Conversation for almost a
<PB N="145" REF="143"/>
Fortnight. First I gave him a particular Account of e∣very Thing that happened material upon my Voyage, and how we were driven into <HI>Harwich</HI> by a very terri∣ble Storm, how I had left my Woman behind me, so frighted with the Danger she had been in, that she durst not venture to set her Foot into a Ship again any more, and that I had not come myself, if the Bills I had of him had not been payable in <HI>Holland;</HI> but that Money, he might see, would make a Woman go any where.</P>
<P>He seem'd to laugh at all our womanish Fears upon the Occasion of the Storm; telling me it was nothing but what was very ordinary in those Seas; but that they had Harbours on every Coast so near, that they were seldom in Danger of being lost indeed; for, <HI>says he,</HI> if they cannot fetch one Coast, they can always stand away for another, and run afore it, <HI>as he called it,</HI> for one Side or other. But when I came to tell him what a crazy Ship it was, and how, even when they got into <HI>Har∣wich,</HI> and into smooth Water, they were fain to run the Ship on Shore, or she would have sunk in the very Harbour; and when I told him that when I looked out at the Cabbin-door, I saw the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> one upon his Knees here, and another there at their Prayers, then in∣deed he acknowledg'd I had Reason to be alarm'd; but smiling, <HI>he added,</HI> but you, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> are so good a Lady, and so pious, you would but have gone to Heaven a little the sooner, the Difference had not been much to you.</P>
<P>I confess, when he said this, it made all the Blood turn in my Veins, and I thought I should have fainted; poor Gentleman! thought I, you know little of me; what would I give to be indeed what you really think me to be! He perceived the Disorder, but said nothing till I spoke; when shaking my Head, <HI>O Sir,</HI> said I, <HI>Death in any Shape has some Terror in it;</HI> but in the frightful Figure of a Storm at Sea, and a sinking Ship, it comes with a double, a treble, and indeed an inex∣pressible Horror; and if I were that Saint you think me to be, which (God knows) I am not, 'tis still very dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mal; I desire to die in a Calm, if I can. He said a great many good Things, and very prettily ordered his
<PB N="146" REF="144"/>
Discourse, between serious Reflection and Compliment, but I had too much Guilt to relish it as it was meant, so I turn'd it off to something else, and talk'd of the Ne∣cessity I had on me to come to <HI>Holland;</HI> but I wish'd myself safe on Shore in <HI>England</HI> again.</P>
<P>He told me he was glad I had such an Obligation up∣on me to come over into <HI>Holland</HI> however; but hinted, that he was so interested in my Welfare, and besides, had such farther Designs upon me, that if I had not so happily been found in <HI>Holland,</HI> he was resolved to have gone to <HI>England</HI> to see me; and that it was one of the principal Reasons of his leaving <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I was extremely obliged to him for so far interesting himself in my Affairs; but that I had been so far his Debtor before that I knew not how any Thing could encrease the Debt; for I ow'd my Life to him al∣ready, and I could not be in Debt for any Thing more valuable than that.</P>
<P>He answer'd in the most obliging Manner possible, that he would put it in my Power to pay that Debt, and all the Obligations besides, that ever he had, or should be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to understand him now, and to see plainly, that he resolved <HI>to make Love to me;</HI> but I would by no Means seem to take the Hint, and besides I knew that he had a Wife with him in <HI>Paris;</HI> and I had, <HI>just then, at least,</HI> no Gust to any more intriguing; however, he surpriz'd me into a sudden Notice of the Thing a little while after, by saying something in his Discourse, that he did, <HI>as he said,</HI> in his Wife's Days. I started at that Word; <HI>What mean you by that?</HI> Sir, said I; <HI>Have you not a Wife at</HI> Paris? No, Madam, indeed, <HI>said he,</HI> my Wife died the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> last; which, it seems, was but a little after I came away.</P>
<P>We liv'd in the same House all this while; and as we lodg'd not far off from one another, Opportunities were not wanting of as near an Acquaintance as we might de∣sire; nor have such Opportunities the least Agency in vicious Minds, to bring to pass even what they might not intend at first.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="145"/>
However, tho' he courted so much at a Distance, yet his Pretensions were very honourable; and as I had be∣fore found him a most disinterested Friend, and perfectly honest in his Dealings, even when I trusted him with all I had; so now I found him strictly virtuous, till I made him otherwise myself, even almost whether he would or no, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former Discourse, when he repeated what he had insinuated before, namely, that he had yet a Design to lay before me, which, if I would agree to his Proposals, would more than ballance all Ac∣counts between us. I told him I could not reasonably deny him any Thing; and <HI>except one Thing, which I hop'd and believed he would not think of,</HI> I should think myself very ungrateful if I did not do every Thing for him that lay in my Power.</P>
<P>He told me what he should desire of me would be fully in my Power to grant, or else he should be very unfriendly to offer it, and still, all this while, he de∣clin'd making the Proposal, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> and so, for that Time, we ended our Discourse, turning it off to other Things; so that, <HI>in short,</HI> I began to think he might have met with some Disaster in his Business, and might have come away from <HI>Paris</HI> in some Discredit; or had had some Blow on his Affairs in general; and as really I had Kindness enough to have parted with a good Sum to have helped him, and was in Gratitude bound to have done so, <HI>he having so effectually saved</HI> to me <HI>all I had;</HI> so I resolved to make him the Offer, the first Time I had an Opportunity, which two or three Days after offered itself very much to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He had told me at large, <HI>tho' on several Occasions,</HI> the Treatment he had met with from the <HI>Jew,</HI> and what Expence he had put him to; how at Length he had cast him, as above, and had recovered good Damage of him, but that the Rogue was unable to make him any Repa∣ration; he had told me also, how the Prince <HI>d'—</HI>'s Gentleman had resented his Treatment of his Master; and how he had caused him to be used upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as I have mention'd above;</HI> which I laugh'd at most heartily.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="146"/>
It is pity, <HI>said I,</HI> that I should sit her and make that Gentleman no Amends; if you would direct me, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> how to do it, I would make him a handsome Present, and acknowledge the Justice he had done to me, as well as to the Prince, his Master. He said he would do what I directed in it; so I told him I would send him 500 Crowns; <HI>That's too much,</HI> said he, <HI>for you are but half interested in the Usage of the</HI> Jew; <HI>it was on his Master's Account he corrected him, not on yours.</HI> Well, however, we were obliged to do nothing in it, for nei∣ther of us knew how to direct a Letter to him, or to di∣rect any Body to him; so I told him I would leave it till I came to <HI>England,</HI> for that my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> cor∣responded with him, and that he had made Love to her.</P>
<P>Well, but Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> as in Requital for his generous Concern for me, I am careful to think of him; it is but just, that what Expence you have been obliged to be at, which was all on my Account, should be repaid you; and therefore, <HI>said I,</HI> let me see<HI>—and there I paused,</HI> and began to reckon up what I had observed from his own Discourse, it had cost him in the several Disputes and Hearings which he had with that <HI>Dog</HI> of a <HI>Jew,</HI> and I cast them up at something above 2130 Crowns; so I pull'd out some Bills which I had upon a Merchant in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and a particular Account in Bank, and was looking on them, in Order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he seeing evidently what I was going about, in∣terrupted me with some Warmth, and told me he would have nothing of me on that Account, and desired I would not pull out my Bills and Papers on that Score; that he had not told me the Story on that Account, or with any such View; that it had been his Misfortune first to bring <HI>that ugly Rogue</HI> to me, which, tho' it was with a good Design, yet he would punish himself with the Expence he had been at, for his being so unlucky to me; that I could not think so hard of him, as to sup∣pose he would take Money of me, <HI>a Widow,</HI> for serv∣ing me, and doing Acts of Kindness to me in a strange Country, and in Distress too; but, <HI>he said,</HI> he would
<PB N="149" REF="147"/>
repeat what he had said before, that he kept me for a deeper Reckoning, and that, as he had told me, he would put me into a Posture to even all that Favour, as I called it, <HI>at once,</HI> so we should talk it over another Time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it would come out, but still he put it off, as before, from whence I concluded it could not be Matter <HI>of Love,</HI> for that those Things are not usually de∣layed in such a Manner, and therefore it must be Mat∣ter of Money; upon which Thought I broke the Silence, and told him that as he knew I had, by Obligation, more Kindness for him than to deny any Favour to him that I could grant, and that he seem'd backward to mention his Case; I begg'd Leave of him to allow me to ask him, whether any Thing lay upon his Mind, with Respect to his Business and Effects in the World? that if it did, he knew what I had in the World as well as I did; and that if he wanted Money, I would let him have any Sum for his Occasion, as far as five or six thousand Pistoles, and he should pay me as his own Affairs would permit; and that if he never paid me, I would assure him, that I would never give him any Trouble for it.</P>
<P>He rose up with Ceremony, and gave me Thanks in Terms that sufficiently told me he had been bred among People more polite, and more courteous than is esteemed the ordinary Usage of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and after his Compli∣ment was over he came nearer to me, and told me that he was obliged to assure me, tho' with repeated Ac∣knowledgments of my kind Offer, that he was not in any Want of Money; that he had met with no Uneasiness in any of his Affairs, no not of any Kind whatever, ex∣cept that of the Loss of his Wife and one of his Chil∣dren, which indeed had troubled him much; but that this was no Part of what he had to offer to me, and by granting which, I should ballance all Obligations; but that, in short, it was that seeing Providence had (as it were for that Purpose) taken his Wife from him, I would make up the Loss to him; and with that he held me fast in his Arms, and kissing me, would not give me Leave to say No, and hardly to breathe.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="148"/>
At length, having got Room to speak, I told him, that, as I had said before, I could deny him but one Thing in the World, I was very sorry he should pro∣pose that Thing only that I cou'd not grant.</P>
<P>I cou'd not but smile however, to myself, that he shou'd make so many Circles, and round about Mo∣tions, to come at a Discourse which had no such Rari∣ty at the Bottom of it, if he had known all: But there was another Reason why I resolv'd not to have him, when, at the same Time, if he had courted me in a Manner less honest or virtuous, I believe I shou'd not have denied him; but I shall come to that Part pre∣sently.</P>
<P>He was, as I have said, long a bringing it out, but when he had brought it out, he pursued it with such Impor∣tunities, as wou'd admit of no Denial, <HI>at least he intend∣ed they shou'd not;</HI> but I resisted them obstinately, and yet with Expressions of the utmost Kindness and Respect for him that cou'd be imagin'd; often telling him, there was nothing else in the World that I cou'd deny him, and shewing him all the Respect, and upon all Occasions treating him with Intimacy and Freedom, as if he had been my Brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the Ways imaginable to bring his Design to pass, but I was inflexible; at last, he thought of a Way, which, he flatter'd himself, wou'd not fail; nor would he have been mistaken perhaps, in any other Wo∣man in the World, but me; this was, to try if he cou'd take me at an Advantage, and get to Bed to me, and then, <HI>as was most rational to think,</HI> I should willing∣ly enough marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were so intimate together, that nothing but Man and Wise could, or at least ought to be, more; but still our Freedoms kept within the Bounds of Modesty and Decency: But one Evening, above all the rest, we were very merry, and I fancy'd he push'd the Mirth to watch for his Advantage; and I resolved that I wou'd, at least, feign to be as merry as he; and that, in short, if he offer'd any Thing, he should have his Will easily enough.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="149"/>
About one a Clock in the Morning, for so long we sat up together, I said, <HI>Come,</HI> 'tis one a Clock, <HI>I must go to Bed; Well,</HI> says he, <HI>I'll go with you;</HI> No, No, says I, <HI>go to your own Chamber;</HI> he said he wou'd go to Bed with me: <HI>Nay,</HI> says I, <HI>if you will,</HI> I don't know what to say; <HI>if I can't help it, you must:</HI> However, I got from him, left him, and went into my Chamber, but did not shut the Door, and as he cou'd easily see that I was undressing myself, he steps to his own Room, which was but on the same Floor, and in a few Mi∣nutes undresses himself also, and returns to my Door in his Gown and Slippers.</P>
<P>I thought he had been gone indeed, and so that he had been in jest; and by the Way, thought either he had no Mind to the Thing, or that he never intended it; so I shut my Door, that is, latch'd it, for I seldom lock'd or bolted it, and went to Bed. I had not been in Bed a Minute, but he comes in his Gown, to the Door, and opens it a little Way, but not enough to come in, or look in, and says softly, What are you really gone to Bed? <HI>Yes, yes,</HI> says I, <HI>get you gone:</HI> No indeed, says he, <HI>I shall not begone, you gave me Leave before to come to Bed, and you shan't say get you gone now:</HI> So he comes into my Room, and then turns about, and fastens the Door, and immediately comes to the Bed-side to me: I pretended to scold and struggle, and bid him begone, with more Warmth than before; but it was all one; he had not a Rag of Cloaths on, but his Gown and Slippers, and Shirt, so he throws off his Gown, and throws open the Bed, and came in at once.</P>
<P>I made a seeming Resistance, but it was no more in∣deed; for, as above, I resolv'd from the Beginning, he should ly with me if he wou'd, and for the rest, I left it to come after.</P>
<P>Well, he lay with me that Night, and the two next, and very merry we were all the three Days between; but the third Night he began to be a little more grave: Now, my Dear, says he, tho' I have push'd this Mat∣ter farther than ever I intended; or than, I believe,
<PB N="152" REF="150"/>
you expected from me, who never made any Pretences to you but what were very honest; yet to heal it all up, and let you see how sincerely I meant at first, and how honest I will ever be to you, I am ready to marry you still, and desire you to let it be done to Morrow morn∣ing; and I will give you the same fair Conditions of Marriage as I wou'd have done before.</P>
<P>This, it must be own'd, was a Testimony that he was very honest, and that he lov'd me sincerely; but I construed it quite another Way, namely, that he aim'd at the Money: But how surpriz'd did he look! and how he was confounded, when he found me receive his Proposal with Coldness and Indifference! and still tell him, that it was the only Thing I cou'd not grant!</P>
<P>He was astonish'd! What not take me now! says he, when I have been a-Bed with you! I answer'd coldly, tho' respectfully still, <HI>It is true,</HI> to my Shame be it spoken, says I, <HI>that you have taken me by Surprize, and have had your Will of me; but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot consent to marry, for all that; if I am with Child,</HI> said I, <HI>Care must be taken to manage that as you shall direct; I hope you won't expose me, for my having expos'd myself to you, but I cannot go any far∣ther;</HI> and at that Point I stood, and wou'd hear of no Matrimony, by any Means.</P>
<P>Now because this may seem a little odd, I shall state the Matter clearly, as I understood it myself. I knew that while I was a Mistress, it is customary for the Per∣son kept, to receive from them that keep; but if I should be a Wife, all I had then, was given up to the Husband, and I was thenceforth to be under his Au∣thority only; and as I had Money enough, and need∣ed not fear being what they call <HI>a cast-off Mistress,</HI> so I had no need to give him twenty thousand Pounds to mar∣ry me, which had been buying my Lodging too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his Project of coming to Bed to me, was a Bite upon himself, while he intended it for a Bite upon me; and he was no nearer his Aim of marrying me, than he was before; all his Arguments he could urge
<PB N="153" REF="151"/>
upon the Subject of Matrimony, were at an End, for I positively declin'd marrying him; and as he had refus'd the thousand Pistoles which I had offer'd him in Com∣pensation for his Expences and Loss, at <HI>Paris,</HI> with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had done it upon the Hopes he had of mar∣rying me; so when he found his Way difficult still, he was amaz'd, and I had some Reason to believe, repented that he had refus'd the Money.</P>
<P>But thus it is when Men run into wicked Measures, to bring their Designs about. I that was infinitely oblig'd to him before, began to talk to him, as if I had ballanc'd Accounts with him now; and that the Favour of Lying with a Whore was equal, not to the thousand Pistoles only, but to all the Debt I ow'd him, for saving my Life, and all my Effects.</P>
<P>But he drew himself into it, and tho' it was a dear Bargain, yet it was a Bargain of his own making; he cou'd not say I had trick'd him into it; but as he pro∣jected and drew me in to ly with him, depending that it was a sure Game in order to a Marriage, so I grant∣ed him the Favour, as he call'd it, to ballance the Ac∣count of Favours receiv'd from him, and keep the thousand Pistoles with a good Grace.</P>
<P>He was extreamly disappointed in this Article, and knew not how to manage for a great while; and as I dare say, if he had not expected to have made it an Earnest for marrying me, he would never have attempt∣ed me the other Way; so, I believ'd, if it had not been for the Money, which he knew I had, he would never have desir'd to marry me after he had lain with me: For, where is the Man that cares to marry a Whore, tho' of his own making? And as I knew him to be no Fool, so I did him no Wrong, when I suppos'd that, but for the Money, he wou'd not have had any Thoughts of me that Way; especially after my yeilding as I had done; in which it is to be remember'd, that I made no Capitula∣tion for marrying him, when I yielded to him, but let him do just what he pleas'd, without any previous Bargain.</P>
<P>Well, hitherto we went upon Guesses at one ano∣ther's Designs; but as he continued to importune me to
<PB N="154" REF="152"/>
marry, tho' he had lain with me, and still did ly with me as often as he pleas'd, and I continued to refuse to mar∣ry him, tho' I let him ly with me whenever he desir'd it; I say, as these two Circumstances made up our Con∣versation, it cou'd not continue long thus, but we must come to an Explanation.</P>
<P>One Morning, in the middle of our unlawful Free∣doms, that is to say, when we were in Bed together; he sigh'd, and told me, he desir'd my Leave to ask me one Question, and that I wou'd give him an An∣swer to it, with the same ingenuous Freedom and Ho∣nesty, that I had us'd to treat him with: I told him I wou'd: Why then his Question was, why I wou'd not marry him, seeing I allow'd him all the Freedom of a Husband? <HI>Or, says he,</HI> my Dear, <HI>since you have been so kind as to take me to your Bed, why will you not make me your own, and take me for good and all,</HI> that we may enjoy ourselves, <HI>without any Reproach to one another.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, that as I confess'd it was the only thing I cou'd not comply with him in, so it was the only Thing in all my Actions, that I cou'd not give him a Reason for; that it was true, I had let him come to Bed to me, which was suppos'd to be the greatest Fa∣vour a Woman could grant; but it was evident, and he might see it, that as I was sensible of the Obliga∣tion I was under to him, for saving me from the worst Circumstance it was possible for me to be brought to, I could deny him nothing; and if I had had any greater Favour to yield him, I shou'd have done it, <HI>that of Matrimony only excepted,</HI> and he could not but see that I lov'd him to an extraordinary Degree, in every Part of my Behaviour to him; but that as to marrying, which was giving up my Liberty, it was what once he knew I had done, and he had seen how it had hurried me up and down in the World, and what it had ex∣pos'd me to; that I had an Aversion to it, and de∣sir'd he wou'd not insist upon it; he might easily see I had no Aversion to him; and that if I was with Child by him, he shou'd see a Testimony of my Kindness to the Father, for that I would settle all I had in the World upon the Child.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="153"/>
He was mute a good while; at last, says he, Come, my Dear, you are the first Woman in the World that ever lay with a Man, and then refus'd to marry him, and therefore there must be some other Reason for your Refusal; and I have therefore one other Request, and that is, If I guess at the true Reason, and remove the Objection, will you then yield to me? I told him, if he remov'd the Objection, I must need comply, for I shou'd certainly do every Thing that I had no Objec∣tion against.</P>
<P>Why then, my Dear, it must be, that either you are already engag'd, and marry'd to some other Man, or you are not willing to dispose of your Money to me, and expect to advance yourself higher with your For∣tune. Now, if it be the first of these, my Mouth will be stopp'd, and I have no more to say; but if it be the last, I am prepar'd effectually to remove the Objection, and answer all you can say on that Subject.</P>
<P>I took him up short at the first of these; telling him, He must have base Thoughts of me indeed, to think that I could yield to him in such a Manner as I had done, and continue it with so much Freedom, as he found I did, if I had a Husband, or were engag'd to any other Man; and that he might depend upon it, that was not my Case, nor any Part of my Case.</P>
<P>Why then, said he, as to the other, I have an Of∣fer to make to you, that shall take off all the Objec∣tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That I will not touch one Pistole of your Estate, more, than shall be with your own voluntary Consent, neither now, or at any other Time, but you shall settle it as you please for your Life, and upon who you please after your Death; that I should see he was able to maintain me without it; and that it was not for that, that he follow'd me from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed surpriz'd at that Part of his Offer, and he might easily perceive it; it was not only what I did not expect, but it was what I knew not what Answer to make to: He had indeed, remov'd my principal Objection, nay, all my Objections, and it was not possible for me to give any Answer; for if upon so ge∣nerous

an Offer I shou'd agree with him, I then did as good as confess, that it was upon the Account of my Money that I refus'd him; and that though I cou'd give up my Virtue, and expose myself, yet I wou'd not give up my Money, which, tho' it was true, yet was really too gross for me to acknowledge, and I cou'd not pretend to marry him upon that Principle neither; then as to having him, and make over all my Estate out of his Hands, so as not to give him the Manage∣ment of what I had, I thought it would be not only a little gothick and inhuman, but would be always a Foundation of Unkindness between us, and render us suspected one to another; so that upon the whole, I was oblig'd to give a new Turn to it, and talk upon a kind of an elevated Strain, which really was not in my Thoughts at first, at all; for I own, as above, the di∣vesting myself of my Estate, and putting my Money out of my Hand, was the Sum of the Matter, that made me refuse to marry; but, I say, I gave it a new Turn upon this Occasion, as follows:</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, differing Notions of Matrimony, from what the receiv'd Custom had given us of it; that I thought a Woman was a free Agent, as well as a Man, and was born free, and cou'd she ma∣nage herself suitably, might enjoy that Liberty to as much Purpose as the Men do; that the Laws of Ma∣trimony were indeed otherwise, and Mankind at this Time acted quite upon other Principles; and those such, that a Woman gave herself entirely away from herself, in Marriage, and capitulated only to be, at best, but an upper Servant, and from the Time she took the Man, she was no better or worse than the Servant among the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who had his Ears bor'd, that is, nail'd to the Door Post; who by that Act, gave himself up to be a Servant during Life.</P>
<P>That the very Nature of the Marriage Contract was, in short, nothing but giving up Liberty, Estate, Au∣thority, and every Thing, to the Man, and the Wo∣man was indeed, a meer Woman ever after, that is to say, a Slave.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="155"/>
He reply'd, that tho' in some Respects it was as I has said, yet I ought to consider, that as an Equiva∣lent to this, the Man had all the Care or Things de∣volv'd upon him; that the Weight o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Business lay upon his Shoulders, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had the Trust, so he had the Toil of Life upon him; his was the Labour, his the Anxiety of Living; that the Woman had nothing to do, but to eat the Fat, and drink the Sweet; to sit still, and look round her; he waited on, and made much of; be serv'd, and lov'd, and made easy; <HI>es∣pecially if the Husband acted as became him;</HI> and that, in general, the Labour of the Man was appointed to make the Woman sive quiet and unconcern'd in the World; that they had the Name of Subjection, with∣out the Thing; and if in inferior Families, they had the Drudgery of the House, and Care of the Provisions upon them; yet they had indeed, much the easier Part; for in general, the Women had only the Care of ma∣naging, that is, spending what their Husbands get; and that a Woman had the Name of Subjection indeed, but that they generally commanded not the Men only, but all they had; manag'd all for themselves, and where the Man did his Duty, the Woman's Life was all Ease and Tranquillity; and that she had nothing to do but to be easy, and to make all that were about her both easy and merry.</P>
<P>I return'd, that while a Woman was single, she was a Masculine in her politic Capacity; that she had then the full Command of what she had, and the full Direc∣tion of what she did; that she was a Man in her sepa∣rated Capacity, to all Intents and Purposes that a Man cou'd be so to himself; that she was controul'd by none, because accountable to none, and was in Subjection to none; so I sung these two Lines of Mr.<HI>—'s.</HI></P>
<Q><L>O! 'tis pleasant to be free,</L>
<L><HI>The sweetest</HI> MISS <HI>is Liberty.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I added, that whoever the Woman was, that had an Estate, and would give it up to be the Slave of a great Man, that Woman was a Fool, and must be fit for no∣thing
<PB N="158" REF="156"/>
but a Beggar; that it was my Opinion, a Woman was as fit to govern and enjoy her own Estate, without a Man, as a Man was without a Woman; and that, if she had a Mind to gratify herself as to Sexes, she might entertain a Man, as a Man does a Mistress; that while she was thus single, she was her own, and if she gave away that Power, she merited to be as miserable as it was possible that any Creature cou'd be.</P>
<P>All he cou'd say, cou'd not Answer the Force of this, as to Argument; only this, that the other Way was the ordinary Method that the World was guided by; that he had Reason to expect I shou'd be content with that which all the World was contented with; that he was of Opinion, that a sincere Affection between a Man and his Wife, answer'd all the Objections that I had made about the being a Slave, a Servant, and the like; and where there was a mutual Love, there cou'd be no Bondage; but that there was but one Interest, one Aim, one Design, and all conspir'd to make both very happy.</P>
<P><HI>Ay,</HI> said I, <HI>that is the Thing I complain of;</HI> the Pre∣tence of Affection, takes from a Woman every Thing that can be call'd herself; she is to have no Interest, no Aim, no View; but all is the Interest, Aim, and View, of the Husband; she is to be the passive Crea∣ture you spoke of, said I; she is to lead a Life of per∣fect Indolence, and living by Faith (not in God, but) in her Husband, she sinks or swims, as he is either Fool or wise Man, unhappy or prosperous; and in the middle of what she thinks is her Happiness and Prosperity, she is ingulph'd in Misery and Beggary, which she had not the least Notice, Knowledge, or Suspicion of: How often have I seen a Woman living in all the Splendor that a plentiful Fortune ought to al∣low her? with her Coaches and Equipages, her Fami∣ly, and rich Furniture, her Attendants and Friends, her Visiters, and good Company, all about her to Day; to Morrow surpriz'd with a Disaster, turn'd out of all by a Commission of Bankrupt, stripp'd to the Cloaths on her Back, her Jointure, <HI>suppose she had it,</HI> is sa∣crific'd
<PB N="159" REF="157"/>
to the Creditors, so long as her Husband liv'd, and she turn'd into the Street, and left to live on the Charity of her Friends, <HI>if she has any,</HI> or follow the Monarch, her Husband, into the <HI>Mint,</HI> and live there on the Wreck of his Fortunes, till he is forc'd to run away from her, even there; and then she sees her Children starve, herself miserable, breaks her Heart, and cries herself to Death? This, says I, is the State of many a Lady that has had ten thousand Pounds to her Portion.</P>
<P>He did not know how feelingly I spoke this, and what Extremities I had gone thro' of this Kind; how near I was to the very last Article above, <HI>viz. crying myself to Death;</HI> and how I really starv'd for almost two Years together.</P>
<P>But he shook his Head, and said, Where had I liv'd? and what dreadful Families had I liv'd among, that had frighted me into such terrible Apprehensions of Things? that these Things indeed, might happen where Men run into hazardous Things in Trade, and without Prudence, or due Consideration, launch'd their Fortunes in a Degree beyond their Strength, grasping at Adventures beyond their Stocks, and the like: but that, as he was stated in the World, if I wou'd embark with him, he had a Fortune equal with mine; that together, we should have no Occasion of engaging in Business any more; but that in any Part of the World where I had a Mind to live, whether <HI>England, France, Holland,</HI> or where I would, we might settle, and live as happily as the World could make any one live; that if I desir'd the Management of our Estate, when put together, if I wou'd not trust him with mine, he wou'd trust me with his; that we wou'd be upon one Bottom, and I shou'd steer: Ay, says I, you'll allow me to steer, that is, hold the Helm, but you'll conn the Ship, <HI>as they call it;</HI> that is, as at Sea, a Boy serves to stand at the Helm, but he that gives him the Orders, is Pilot.</P>
<P>He laugh'd at my Simile; No, says he, you shall be Pilot then, you shall conn the Ship; ay, says I, as
<PB N="160" REF="158"/>
long as you please, but you can take the Helm out of my Hand when you please, and bid me go spin: It is not you, says I, that I suspect, but the Laws of Ma∣trimony puts the Power into your Hands, and bids you do it; commands you to command; and binds me, forsooth, to obey; you, that are now upon even Terms with me, and I with you, says I, are the next Hour set upon the Throne, and the humble Wife plac'd at at your Footstool; all the rest, all that you call One∣ness of Interest, mutual Affection, and the like, is Cur∣tesy and Kindness then, and a Woman is indeed infi∣nitely oblig'd where she meets with it; but can't help herself where it fails.</P>
<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to the serious Part, and there he thought he should be too ma∣ny for me; he first hinted, that Marriage was decreed by Heaven; that it was the fix'd State of Life, which God had appointed for Man's Felicity, and for esta∣blishing a legal Posterity; that there cou'd be no legal Claim of Estates by Inheritance, but by Children born in Wedlock; that all the rest was sunk under Scandal and Illegitimacy; and very well he talk'd upon that Subject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I took him short there; Look you, Sir, said I, you have an Advantage of me there indeed, in my particular Case; but it wou'd not be ge∣nerous to make use of it; I readily grant, that it were better for me to have marry'd you, than to admit you to the Liberty I have given you; but as I cou'd not reconcile my Judgment to Marriage, for the Reasons above, and had Kindness enough for you, and Obliga∣tion too much on me, to resist you, I suffer'd your Rudeness, and gave up my Virtue; but I have two Things before me to heal up that Breach of Honour, without that desperate one of Marriage; and those are, Repentance for what is past, and putting an End to it for Time to come.</P>
<P>He seem'd to be concern'd, to think that I shou'd take him in that Manner; he assured me that I mis∣understood him; that he had more Manners, as well
<PB N="161" REF="159"/>
as more Kindness for me; and more Justice than to re∣proach me with what he had been the Aggressor in, and had surpriz'd me into; that what he spoke, refer'd to my Words above, that the Woman, if she thought fit, might entertain a Man, as the Man did a Mistress; and that I seem'd to mention that Way of Living as justify∣able, and setting it as a lawful Thing, and in the Place of Matrimony.</P>
<P>Well, we strained some Compliments upon those Points not worth repeating; and I added, I supposed when he got to Bed to me, he thought himself sure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary Course of Things, af∣ter he had lain with me he ought to think so; but that, upon the same Foot of Argument which I had discours'd with him upon, it was just the contrary; and when a Woman had been weak enough to yield up the last Point before Wedlock, it would be adding one Weakness to another, to take the Man afterwards, to pin down the Shame of it upon herself all the Days of her Life, and bind herself to live all her Time with the only Man that could upbraid her with it; that in yielding at first, she must be a Fool, but to take the Man, is to be sure to be call'd a Fool; that to resist a Man, is to act with Courage and Vigour, and to cast off the Reproach, which, in the Course of Things, drops out of Know∣ledge, and dies; the Man goes one Way, and the Wo∣man another, as Fate, and the Circumstances of Living direct; and if they keep one another's Council, the Folly is heard no more of; but to take the Man, <HI>says I,</HI> is the most preposterous Thing in Nature, and (sav∣ing your Presence) is to befoul one's self, and live al∣ways in the Smell of it; <HI>No, no,</HI> added I, after a Man has lain with me, <HI>as a Mistress,</HI> he ought never to ly with me <HI>as a Wife;</HI> that's not only preserving the Crime in Memory, but it is recording it in the Family; if the Woman marries the Man afterwards, she beats the Re∣proach of it to the last Hour; if her Husband is not a Man of a hundred thousand, he sometime or other up∣braids her with it; if he has Children, they fail not one Way or other to hear of it; if the Children are virtu∣ous, they do their Mother the Justice to hate her for it;
<PB N="162" REF="160"/>
if they are wicked, they give her the Mortification of doing the like, and giving her for the Example. On the other Hand, if the Man and the Woman part, there is an End of the Crime, and an End of the Clamour; Time wears out the Memory of it; or a Woman may remove but a few Streets, and she soon out-lives it, and hears no more of it.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this Discourse, and told me he could not say but that I was right in the Main; that as to that Part relating to managing Estates, it was argu∣ing <HI>a la Chavalier;</HI> it was in some Sense right, if the Women were able to carry it on so, but that in general, the Sex were not capable of it; their Heads were not turned for it, and they had better chuse a Person capable and honest, that knew how to do them Justice, as Wo∣men, as well as to love them; and that then the Trouble was all taken off of their Hands.</P>
<P>I told him it was a dear Way of purchasing their Ease; for very often when the Trouble was taken off of their Hands, so was their Money too; and that I thought it was far safer for the Sex not to be afraid of the Trouble, but to be really afraid of their Money; and that if no Body was trusted, no Body would be deceiv∣ed; and the Staff in their own Hands, was the best Secu∣rity in the World.</P>
<P>He reply'd that I had started a new Thing in the World; that however I might support it by subtle Rea∣soning, yet it was a Way of arguing that was contrary to the general Practice, and that he confess'd he was much disappointed in it; that had he known I would have made such an Use of it, he would never have at∣tempted what he did, which he had no wicked Design in, resolving to make me Reparation, and that he was very sorry he had been so unhappy; that he was very sure he should never upbraid me with it hereafter, and had so good an Opinion of me as to believe I did not sus∣pect him; but seeing I was positive in refusing him, not∣withstanding what had pass'd, he had nothing to do but to secure me from Reproach, by going back again to <HI>Paris,</HI> that so, according to my own Way of arguing,
<PB N="163" REF="161"/>
it might die out of Memory, and I might never meet with it again to my Disadvantage.</P>
<P>I was not pleased with this Part at all, for I had no Mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no Mind to give him such Hold of me as he would have had; and thus I was in a kind of Suspense, irresolute, and doubt∣ful what Course to take.</P>
<P>I was in the House with him, as I have observed, and I saw evidently that he was preparing to go back to <HI>Paris;</HI> and particularly, I found he was remitting Mo∣ney to <HI>Paris,</HI> which was, as I understood afterwards, to pay for some Wines which he had given Order to have bought for him at <HI>Troyes</HI> in <HI>Champagne;</HI> and I knew not what course to take; and besides that, I was very loth to part with him; I found also that I was with Child by him, which was what I had not yet told him of; and sometimes I thought not to tell him of it at all; but I was in a strange Place, and had no Acquaintance, tho' I had a great deal of Substance, which, indeed, having no Friends there, was the more dangerous to me.</P>
<P>This obliged me to take him one Morning, when I saw him, as I thought, a little anxious about his going, and irresolute; <HI>says I</HI> to him, <HI>I fancy you can hardly find in your Heart to leave me now.</HI> The more <HI>unkind is it in you,</HI> said he, <HI>severely unkind, to refuse a Man that knows not how to part with you.</HI></P>
<P>I am so far from being unkind to you, <HI>said I,</HI> that I will go over all the World with you, if you desir'd me, except to <HI>Paris,</HI> where you know I can't go.</P>
<P>It is Pity so much Love, <HI>said he,</HI> on both Sides should ever separate.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>said I,</HI> do you go away from me?</P>
<P>Because, <HI>said he,</HI> you won't take me.</P>
<P>But if I won't take you, <HI>said I,</HI> you may take me any where, but to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>He was very loth to go any where, <HI>he said,</HI> without me; but he must go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I did not use to court, but I durst venture myself to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> with him, if there was a Ne∣cessity of his going.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="162"/>
He told me, God be thank'd, he was in no Necessity of going any where, but that he had a tempting Invi∣tation to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I answer'd, I would say nothing to that; but that I desired he would go any where but to <HI>Paris;</HI> because there he knew I must not go.</P>
<P>He said he had no Remedy, but to go where I could not go; for he could not bear to see me, if he must not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkindest Thing he could say of me, and that I ought to take it very ill, seeing I knew how very well to oblige him to stay, without yielding to what he knew I could not yield to.</P>
<P>This amazed him, and he told me I was pleased to be mysterious; but, that he was sure it was in no Body's Power to hinder him going, if he resolv'd upon it, ex∣cept me; who had Influence enough upon him to make him do any Thing.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>I told him,</HI> I could hinder him, because I knew he could no more do an unkind Thing by me than he could do an unjust one; and to put him out of his Pain, I told him I was with Child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his Arms, and kissing me a thousand Times almost, said, Why would I be so unkind, not tell him that before?</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>'twas hard,</HI> that to have him stay, I should be forc'd to do as Criminals do to avoid the Gal∣lows, <HI>plead my Belly;</HI> and that I thought I had given him Testimonies enough of an Affection equal to that of a Wife, if I had not only lain with him, been with Child by him, shewn myself unwilling to part with him, but offer'd to go to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> with him; and ex∣cept one Thing that I could not grant, what could he ask more?</P>
<P>He stood mute a good while, but afterwards told me, he had a great deal more to say, if I could assure him, that I would not take ill whatever Freedom he might use with me in his Discourse.</P>
<P>I told him that he might use any Freedom in Words with me; for a Woman who had given Leave to such
<PB N="165" REF="163"/>
other Freedoms, as I had done, had left herself no Room <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take any Thing ill, let it be what it would.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>he said,</HI> I hope you believe, Madam, I was born a Christian, and that I have some Sense of sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red Things upon my Mind; when I first broke in up∣on my own Virtue, and assaulted yours; when I sur∣prized, and, as it were, forc'd you to that which nei∣ther you intended, or I design'd but a few Hours before, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was upon a Presumption that you would certainly mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y me, if once I could go that Length with you; and it was with an honest Resolution to make you my Wife.</P>
<P>But I have been surprized with such a Denial, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Woman in such Circumstances ever gave to a Man; for certainly it was never known that any Woman re∣fused to marry a Man that had first lain with her, much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess a Man that had gotten her with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon different Notions from all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou reason upon it so strongly, that a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y what to answer, yet I must own, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it shocking to Nature, and something very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> yourself; but above all, it is unkind to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et unborn; who, if we marry, will come into the World with Advantage enough, but if not, is ruined be∣fore it is born; must bear the eternal Reproach of what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is not guilty of; must be branded from its Cradle with a Mark of Infamy; be loaded with the Crimes and Follies of its Parents, and suffer for Sins that it never committed: This I take to be very hard, and indeed cruel to the poor Infant not yet born, who you cannot think of with any Patience, if you have the common Affection of a Mother, and not do that for it, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould at once place it on a Level with the rest of the World, and not leave it to curse its Parents for what al∣so we ought to be asham'd of: I cannot therefore, <HI>says he,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at beg and intreat you, as you are a Christian, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other, not to let the innocent Lamb you go with be ruined before it is born, and leave it to curse and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eproach us hereafter, for what may be so easily a∣voided.</P>
<P>Then, dear Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> with a World of Ten∣derness (and I thought I saw Tears in his Eyes) allow
<PB N="166" REF="164"/>
me to repeat it, that I am a Christian, and consequent∣ly I do not allow what I have rashly, and without due Consideration, done; I say, I do not approve of it as lawful; and therefore tho' I did, with a View I have mentioned, one unjustifiable Action, I cannot say that I could satisfy myself to live in a continual Practice of what in Judgment we must both condemn; and tho' I love you above all the Women in the World, and have done enough to convince you of it, by resolving to marry you after what has pass'd between us, and by of∣fering to quit all Pretensions to any Part of your Estate, so that I should, as it were, take a Wife after I had lain with her, and without a Farthing Portion; which, as my Circumstances are, I need not do; I say, notwith∣standing my Affection to you, which is inexpressible, yet I cannot give up my Soul as well as Body, the Interest of this World, and the Hopes of another; and you cannot call this my Disrespect to you.</P>
<P>If ever any Man in the World was truly valuable for the strictest Honesty of Intention, <HI>this was the Man;</HI> and if ever a Woman in her Senses rejected a Man of Merit on so trivial and frivolous a Pretence, <HI>I was the Woman;</HI> but surely it was the most preposterous Thing that ever Woman did.</P>
<P>He would have taken me as a Wife, but would not en∣tertain me as a Whore; was ever Woman angry with any Gentleman on that Head? and was ever Woman so stu∣pid to chuse to be a Whore, where she might have been an honest Wife? But Infatuations are next to being pos∣sessed with the Devil. I was inflexible, and pretended to argue upon the Point of a Woman's Liberty, as be∣fore; but he took me short, and with more Warmth than he had yet us'd with me, tho' with the utmost Res∣pect; reply'd, dear Madam, you argue for Liberty at the same Time that you restrain yourself from that Li∣berty, which God and Nature has directed you to take; and to supply the Deficiency, propose a vicious Liberty, which is neither honourable or religious; will you pro∣pose Liberty at the Expence of Modesty.</P>
<P>I return'd, that he mistook me; I did not propose it; I only said that those could not be content without con∣cerning
<PB N="167" REF="165"/>
the Sexes in that Affair, might do so indeed; might entertain a Man as Men do a Mistress, if they thought fit, but he did not hear me say I would do so; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd tho', by what had pass'd, he might well censure me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that Part, yet he should find, for the future, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould freely converse with him without any Inclination <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Way.</P>
<P>He told me, he could not promise that for himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thought he ought not to trust himself with the Op∣portunity; for that, as he had fail'd already, he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth <HI>lead himself into Temptation</HI> of offending again; and that this was the true Reason of his resolving to go back <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Paris;</HI> not that he could willingly leave me, and would be very far from wanting my Invitation; but if he could not stay upon Terms that became him, either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s an honest Man, or a Christian, what could he do? And he hop'd, <HI>he said,</HI> I could not blame him, that he was unwilling any Thing that was to call him Father should upbraid him with leaving him in the World to be called Bastard; adding, that he was astonish'd to think how I could satisfy myself to be so cruel to an in∣nocent Infant not yet born; profess'd he could never bear the Thoughts of it, much less bear to see it, and hop'd I would not take it ill that he could not stay to see me delivered for that very Reason.</P>
<P>I saw he spoke this with a disturb'd Mind, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was with some Difficulty that he restrained his Pas∣sion; so I declin'd any farther Discourse upon it; only said, I hop'd he would consider of it: <HI>O Madam,</HI> says he, <HI>do not bid me consider,</HI> 'tis <HI>for you to consider;</HI> and with that he went out of the Room, in a strange kind of Confusion, as was easy to be seen in his Counte∣nance.</P>
<P>If I had not been one of the foolishest as well as wickedest Creatures upon Earth, I could never have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted thus. I had one of the honestest compleatest Gen∣tlemen upon Earth, at my Hand; he had in one Sense <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>av'd my Life, but had sav'd that Life from Ruin in a most remarkable Manner; he lov'd me even to Destrac∣tion, and had come from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> on Pur∣pose to seek me; he had offer'd me Marriage, even
<PB N="168" REF="166"/>
after I was with Child by him, and had offered to quit all his Pretensions to my Estate, and give it up to my own Management, having a plentiful Estate of his own: Here I might have settled myself out of the Reach even of Disaster itself; his Estate and mine would have purchased even then above two thousand Pounds a Year, and I might have liv'd like a Queen, nay, far more happy than a Queen; and which was above all, I had now an Opportunity to have quitted a Life of Crime and De∣bauchery, which I had been given up to for several Years, and to have sat down quiet in Plenty and Ho∣nour, and to have set myself apart to the Great Work, which I have since seen so much Necessity of, and Oc∣casion for; I mean that of Repentance.</P>
<P>But my Measure of Wickedness was not yet full; I continued obstinate against Matrimony, and yet I could not bear the Thoughts of his going away neither. As to the Child I was not very anxious about it; I told him, I would promise him that it should never come to him to upbraid him with its being illegitimate; that if it was a Boy I would breed it up like the Son of a Gentleman, and use it well for his Sake; and after a little more such Talk as this, and seeing him resolved to go, I retir'd, but could not help letting him see the Tears run down my Cheeks; he came to me, and kiss'd me, entreated me, conjur'd me by the Kindness he had shewn me in my Distress; by the Justice had done me in my Bills and Money-affairs; by the Respect which made him refuse a thousand Pistoles from me for his Expences with that Traytor, the <HI>Jew;</HI> by the Pledge of our Misfortunes, <HI>so he call'd it,</HI> which I carry'd with me; and by all the sincerest Affection could propose to do, that I would not drive him away.</P>
<P>But it would not; I was stupid and senseless, deaf to all his Importunities, and continued so to the last; so we parted, only desiring me to promise that I would write him Word when I was delivered, and how he might give me an Answer; and this I engaged my Word I would do; and upon his desiring to be inform'd which Way I intended to dispose of myself, I told him I re∣solved to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London,</HI> where
<PB N="169" REF="167"/>
I proposed to ly in; but since he resolved to leave me, I told him I supposed it would be of no Consequence to him, what became of me.</P>
<P>He lay in his Lodgings that Night, but went away early in the Morning, leaving me a Letter, in which he repeated all he had said; recommended the Care of the Child, and desired of me that as he had remitted to me the Offer of a thousand Pistoles, which I would have given him for the Recompense of his Charges and Trouble with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had given it me back; so he desir'd I would allow him to oblige me to set a∣part that thousand Pistoles with its Improvement for the Child, and for its Education; earnestly pressing me to secure that little Portion for the abandon'd Orphan, when I should think fit, <HI>as he was sure I wou'd,</HI> to throw away the rest upon something as worthless as my sincere Friend at <HI>Paris;</HI> he concluded with moving me to reflect with the same Regret as he did, on our Follies we had committed together; ask'd me Forgiveness for being the Aggressor in the Fact; and forgave me every Thing, <HI>he said,</HI> but the Cruelty of refusing him, which be own'd he could not forgive me so heartily as he shou'd do, because he was satisfied it was an Injury to myself, would be an Introduction to my Ruin, and that I would seriously repent of it; he foretold some fatal Things, which, <HI>he said,</HI> he was well assured I should fall into; and that, at last I should be ruined by a bad Husband; bid me be the more wary, that I might render him a false Prophet; but to remember, that if ever I came in∣to Distress, I had a fast Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> who would not upbraid me with the unkind Things past, but would be always ready to return me Good for Evil.</P>
<P>This Letter stunn'd me, I could not think it possible for any one, that had not dealt with the Devil, to write such a Letter; for he spoke of some particular Things which afterwards were to befal me, with such an Assu∣rance, that it frighted me before-hand; and when those Things did come to pass, I was perswaded he had some more than human Knowledge; in a Word, his Advices to me to repent, were very affectionate; his Warnings of Evil to happen to me, were very kind; and his Pro∣mises
<PB N="170" REF="168"/>
of Assistance, if I wanted him, were so generous, that I have seldom seen the like; and tho' I did not at first set much by that Part, because I look'd upon them as what might not happen, and as what was improbable to happen at that Time; yet all the rest of his Letter was so moving, that it left me very melancholly, and I cry'd four and twenty Hours after almost without ceasing about it; and yet even all this while, whatever it was that bewitch'd me, I had not one serious Wish that I had taken him; I wish'd heartily indeed that I could have kept him with me, but I had a mortal Aver∣sion to marrying him, or indeed, any Body else; but form'd a thousand wild Notions in my Head, that I was yet gay enough, and young and handsome enough to please a Man of Quality; and that I would try my Fortune at <HI>London,</HI> come of it what would.</P>
<P>Thus blinded by my own Vanity, I threw away the only Opportunity I then had, to have effectually settled my Fortunes, and secur'd them for this World; and I am a Memorial to all that shall read my Story, a stand∣ing Monument of the Madness and Distraction which Pride and Infatuations from Hell runs us into, how <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll our Passions guide us, and how dangerously we act, when we follow the Dictates of an ambitious Mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful and agreeable, and not yet old; I had known something of the Influence I had had up∣on the Fancies of Men, even of the highest Rank; I never forgot that the Prince <HI>de—</HI>had said with an Extasy, that I was the finest Woman in <HI>France.</HI> I knew I could make a Figure at <HI>London,</HI> and how well I could grace that Figure. I was not at a Loss how to behave, and having already been ador'd by Princes, I thought of nothing less than of being Mistress to the King himself: But I go back to my immediate Circumstances at that Time.</P>
<P>I got over the Absence of my honest Merchant but slowly at first; it was with infinite Regret that I let him go at all; and when I read the Letter he left, I was quite confounded; as soon as he was out of Call, and irrecoverable, I would have given half I had in the World for him back again; my Notions of Things
<PB N="171" REF="169"/>
chang'd in an Instant, and I called myself a thousand Fools, for casting myself upon a Life of Scandal and Hazard; when after the Shipwreck of Virtue, Honour and Principle, and sailing at the utmost Risque in the stormy Seas of Crime, and abominable Levity, I had a safe Harbour presented, and no Heart to cast Anchor in it.</P>
<P>His Predictions terrify'd me, his Promises of Kind∣ness if I came to Distress, melted me into Tears, but frighted me with the Apprehensions of ever coming into such Distress, and fill'd my Head with a thousand Anxi∣eties and Thoughts, how it should be possible for me, who had now such a Fortune, to sink again into Misery.</P>
<P>Then the dreadful Scene of my Life, when I was left with my five Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I have related, repre∣sented itself again to me, and I sat considering what Measures I might take to bring myself to such a State of Desolation again, and how I should act to avoid it.</P>
<P>But these Things wore off gradually; as to my Friend, the Merchant, he was gone, and gone irrecoverably, for I durst not follow him to <HI>Paris,</HI> for the Reasons mentioned above; again, I was afraid to write to him to return, lest he should have refused, as I verily be∣liev'd he would; so I sat and cry'd intollerably for some Weeks; but I say, it wore off gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of Business for managing my Effects, the Hurry of that particular Part serv'd to divert my Thoughts, and in Part to wear out the Impressions which had been made upon my Mind.</P>
<P>I had sold my Jewels, all but the fine Diamond Ring, which my Gentleman the Jeweller, us'd to wear, and this, at proper Times, I wore myself; as also the Dia∣mond Necklace, which the Prince had given me, and a Pair of extraordinary Ear-rings worth about 600 Pi∣stoles; the other, which was a fine Casket, he left with me at his going to <HI>Versailles,,</HI> and a small Case with some Rubies and Emeralds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say, I sold them at the <HI>Hague</HI> for 7600 Pistoles; I had received all the Bills which the Merchant had help'd me to at <HI>Paris,</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="170"/>
with the Money I brought with me, they made up 13900 Pistoles more; so that I had in Ready-money, and in Account in the Bank of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> above one and twen∣ty thousand Pistoles, besides Jewels; and how to get this Treasure to <HI>England</HI> was my next Care.</P>
<P>The Business I had had now with a great many Peo∣ple, for receiving such large Sums, and selling Jewels of such considerable Value, gave me Opportunity to know and converse with several of the best Merchants of the Place; so that I wanted no Direction now how to get my Money remitted to <HI>England;</HI> applying therefore to several Merchants, that I might neither risque it all on the Credit of one Merchant, nor suffer any single Man to know the Quantity of Money I had; I say, ap∣plying myself to several Merchants I got Bills of Ex∣change payable at <HI>London</HI> for all my Money; the first Bills I took with me, the second Bills I left in Trust, (in Case of any Disaster at Sea) in the Hands of the first Merchant, him to whom I was recommended by my Friend from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus spent nine Months in <HI>Holland,</HI> refused the best Offer ever Woman in my Circumstances had, parted unkindly, and indeed barbarously with the best Friend, and honestest Man in the World, got all my Money in my Pocket, and a Bastard in my Belly, I took Shipping at the <HI>Briel</HI> in the Packet-boat, and arrived safe at <HI>Harwich,</HI> where my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> was come, by my Direction, to meet me.</P>
<P>I would willingly have given ten thousand Pounds of my Money to have been rid of the Burthen I had in my Belly, as above; but it could not be, so I was obliged to bear with that Part, and get rid of it by the ordina∣ry Method of Patience, and a hard Travel.</P>
<P>I was above the contemptible Usage that Women in my Circumstances oftentimes meet with. I had consi∣dered all that fully; and having sent <HI>Amy</HI> before∣hand, and remitted her Money to do it, she had taken me a very handsome House in<HI>—Street,</HI> ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> had hir'd me two Maids and a Foot∣man, whom she had put in a good Livery; and having hir'd a Glass-Coach and four Horses, she came with them
<PB N="173" REF="171"/>
and the Man-Servant to <HI>Harwich</HI> to meet me, and had been there near a Week before I came; so I had no∣thing to do but to go away to <HI>London</HI> to my own House, where I arriv'd in very good Health, and pass'd for a <HI>French</HI> Lady, by the Title of—.</P>
<P>My first Business was, to get all my Bills accepted; which, to cut the Story short, were all both accepted, and currently paid; and I then resolv'd to take me a Country-Lodging somewhere near the Town, to be <HI>In∣cognito,</HI> till I was brought to Bed; which, appearing in such a Figure, and having such an Equipage, I easily manag'd without any Body's offering the usual Insults of Parish-Enquiries. I did not appear in my new House for some Time; and afterwards I thought fit, for par∣ticular Reasons to quit that House, and not come to it at all, but take handsome large Apartments in the <HI>Pall∣mall,</HI> in a House, out of which was a private Door into the King's Garden, by Permission of the chief Garden∣er, who had liv'd in the House.</P>
<P>I had now all my Effects secur'd; but my Money be∣ing my great Concern at that Time, I found it a Dif∣ficulty how to dispose of it, so as to bring me in an an∣nual Interest; however, in some Time I got a substan∣tial safe Mortgage for 14000 <HI>l.</HI> by the Assistance of the famous Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> for which I had an Es∣tate of 1800 Pounds a Year bound to me; and had 700 Pounds per <HI>Annum</HI> Interest for it.</P>
<P>This, with some other Securities, made me a very handsome Estate of above a thousand Pounds a Year; enough, one would think, to keep any Woman in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from being a Whore.</P>
<P>I lay in at—, about four Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and brought a fine Boy into the World; and according to my Promise, sent an Account of it to my Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Father of it; and in the Letter told him how sorry I was for his going away, and did as good as intimate that if he would come once more to see me I should use him better than I had gone. He gave me a very kind and obliging Answer, but took not the least Notice of what I had said <HI>of his coming over,</HI> so I found
<PB N="174" REF="172"/>
my Interest lost there for ever. He gave me Joy of the Child, and hinted that he hop'd I would make good what he had begg'd for the poor Infant, as I had pro∣mised; and I sent him Word again that I would send his Order to a Title; and such a Fool, and so weak I was in this last Letter, notwithstanding what I have said of his not taking Notice of my Invitation, as to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k his Pardon almost for the Usage I gave him at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and stoop'd so low as to expostulate with him for not taking Notice of my inviting him to come to me again, as I had done; and which was still more, went so far as to make a second Sort of an Offer to him, telling him almost in plain Words that if he would come over now I would have him; but he never gave me the least Reply to it at all, which was as absolute a Denial to me as he was ever able to give; so I sat down, I cannot say contented, but vex'd heartily that I had made the Offer at all, for he had, as I may say, his full Revenge of me, in scorning to answer, and to let me twice ask that of him, which he with so much Importunity begg'd of me before.</P>
<P>I was now up again, and soon came to my City Lodg∣ing in the <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> and here I began to make a Fi∣gure suitable to my Estate, which was very great; and and I shall give you an Account of my Equipage in a few Words, and of myself too.</P>
<P>I paid 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for my new Apartments, for I took them by the Year, but then they were handsome Lodgings indeed, and very richly furnished. I kept my own Servants to clean and look after them, found my own Kitchen-ware and Firing; my Equipage was hand∣some but not very large; I had a Coach, a Coachman, a Footman, my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> whom I now dress'd like a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion, and three Maids, and thus I liv'd for a Time. I dress'd to the Height of every Mode, went extremely rich in Cloaths, and as for Jewels, I wanted none; I gave a very good Livery lac'd with Silver, and as rich as any Body below the Nobility could be seen with; and thus I appeared, leaving the World to guess who or what I was, without offering to put myself forward.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="173"/>
I walk'd sometimes in the <HI>Mall</HI> with my Woman <HI>A∣my,</HI> but I kept no Company, and made no Acquaint∣ances, only made as gay a Shew as I was able to do, and that upon all Occasions; I found however the World was not altogether so unconcern'd about me as I seem'd to be about them; and first I understood that the Neighbours began to be mighty inquisitive about me; as who I was? and what my Circumstances were?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Person that could answer their Cu∣riosity, or give any Account of me, and she a tatling Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and a true Gossip, took Care to do that with all the Art that she was Mistress of; she let them know that I was the Widow of a Person of Quality in <HI>France,</HI> that I was very rich, that I came over hither to look af∣ter an Estate that fell to me by some of my Relations who died here, that I was worth 40000 <HI>l.</HI> all in my own Hands, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>This was all wrong in <HI>Amy,</HI> and in me too, tho' we did not see it at first, for this recommended me indeed to those Sort of Gentlemen they call <HI>Fortune-hunters,</HI> and who always besieg'd Ladies, <HI>as they call it,</HI> on Pur∣pose to take them Prisoners, <HI>as I called it,</HI> that is to say, to marry the Women, and have the spending of their Money. But if I was wrong in refusing the honourable Proposals of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, who offered me the Disposal of my whole Estate, and had as much of his own to maintain me with; I was right now in refusing those Offers which came generally from Gentlemen of good Families and good Estates, but who living to the Extent of them, were always needy and necessitous, and want∣ed a Sum of Money to make themselves easy, <HI>as they call it,</HI> that is to say, to pay off Incumbrances, Sisters Portions, <HI>and the like;</HI> and then the Woman is Prisoner for Life, and may live as they please to give her Leave. This Life I had seen into clearly enough, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was not to be catch'd that Way; however, as I said, the Reputation of my Money brought several of those Sort of Gentry about me, and they found Means, by one Stratagem or other, to get Access to my Ladyship; but, in short, I answered them all well enough; <HI>that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved single, and was happy;</HI> that <HI>as I had no Occasion</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="174"/>
<HI>to change my Condition for an Estate,</HI> so I did not see, <HI>that by the best Offer that any of them could make me, I could mend my Fortune; that I might be honoured with</HI> Titles indeed, and in Time rank on public Occasions with the Peeresses; I mention that, because one that offered at me was the eldest Son of a Peer; <HI>But that I was as well without the Title,</HI> as long as <HI>I had the Estate; and while I had</HI> 2000 l. <HI>a Year of my own, I was happier then I could be in being Prisoner of State to a Nobleman;</HI> for I took the Ladies of that Rank to be little better.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> with whom I had the good Fortune to become acquainted, on Ac∣count of the Mortgage which he help'd me to, it is ne∣cessary to take Notice, that I had much Advantage in my ordinary Affairs, by his Advice, and therefore I cal∣led it my good Fortune; for as he paid me so considera∣ble an annual Income as 700 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, so I am to ac∣knowledge myself much a Debtor, not only to the Jus∣tice of his Dealings with me, but to the Prudence and Conduct which he guided me to, by his Advice, for the Management of my Estate; and as he found I was not inclin'd to marry, he frequently took Occasion to hint how soon I might raise my Fortune to a prodigious Height, if I would but order my Family-Oeconomy so far within my Revenue as to lay up every Year some∣thing to add to the Capital.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd of the Truth of what he said, and a∣greed to the Advantages of it; you are to take it as you go, that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> supposed by my own Discourse, and especially by my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> that I had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Income; he judged, as he said, by my Way of Living, that I could not spend above one thousand; and so, he added, I might prudently lay by 1000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year to add to the Capital; and by adding every Year the ad∣ditional Interest or Income of the Money to the Capital, he prov'd to me, that in ten Years I should double the 1000 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Annum,</HI> that I laid by; and he drew me out a Table, as he call'd it, of the Increase for me to judge by; and by which, he said, if the Gentlemen of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> would but act so, every Family of them would en∣crease their Fortunes to a great Degree, just as Merchants
<PB N="177" REF="175"/>
do by Trade; whereas now, <HI>says Sir</HI> Robert, by the Humour of living up to the Extent of their Fortunes, and rather beyond, the Gentlemen, <HI>says he,</HI> ay, and the Nobility too, are almost all of them Borrowers, and all in necessitous Circumstances.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>Robert</HI> frequently visited me, and was (if I may say so from his own Mouth) very well pleased with my Way of conversing with him, for he knew nothing, nor so much as guess'd at what I had been; I say, as he came often to see me, so he always entertained me with this Scheme of Frugality; and one Time he brought another Paper, wherein he shew'd me much to the same Purpose as the former, to what Degree I should encrease my Estate, if I would come into his Method of contract∣ing my Expences; and by this Scheme of his, it ap∣peared, that laying up a thousand Pounds a Year, and every Year adding the Interest to it, I should in twelve Years Time have in Bank one and twenty thousand, and fifty eight Pounds, after which I might lay up two thou∣sand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>I objected that I was a young Woman, that I had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d to live plentifully, and with a good Appearance, and that I knew not how to be a Miser.</P>
<P>He told me that if I thought I had enough, it was well; but if I desir'd to have more, this was the Way, that in another twelve Years, I should be too rich, so that I should not know what to do with it.</P>
<P>Ay Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> you are contriving how to make me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> old Woman, but that won't answer my End; I had rather have 20000 <HI>l.</HI> now than 60000 <HI>l.</HI> when I am fifty Years old.</P>
<P><HI>Then, Madam,</HI> says he, <HI>I suppose your Honour has no Children?</HI></P>
<P><HI>None, Sir</HI> Robert, said I, <HI>but what are provided for:</HI> so I left him in the dark, as much as I found him. How∣ever, I consider'd his Scheme very well, tho' I said no more to him at that Time, and I resolved, tho' I would make a very good Figure, I say, I resolved to abate a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iule of my Expence, and draw in, live closer, and save <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omething, if not so much as he propos'd to me. It was near the End of the Year that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> made this
<PB N="178" REF="176"/>
Proposal to me, and when the Year was up, I went to his House in the City, and there I told him, I came to thank him for his Scheme of Frugality; that I had been studying much upon it; and tho' I had not been able to mortify myself so much as to lay up a thousand Pounds a Year: yet, as I had not come to him for my Interest half yearly, as was usual, I was now come to let him know, that I had resolv'd to lay up that seven hundred Pounds a Year, and, never use a Penny of it, desiring him to help me to put it out to Advantage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> a Man thorowly vers'd in Arts of impro∣ving Money, but thorowly honest, said to me, Madam, I am glad you approve of the Method that I propos'd to you; but you have begun wrong; you shou'd have come for your Interest at the half Year, and then you had had the Money to put out; now you have lost half a Year's Interest of 350 <HI>l.</HI> which is 9 <HI>l.</HI> for I had but 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Mortgage.</P>
<P>Well, well, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> can you put this out for me now?</P>
<P>Let it lie, Madam, says he, till the next Year, and then I'll put out your 1400 <HI>l.</HI> together, and in the mean Time I'll pay you Interest for the <HI>700 l</HI> so he gave me his Bill for the Money which he told me should be no less than 6 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>'s Bill was what no body wou'd refuse; so I thank'd him, and let it lie; and next Year I did the same, and the third Year Sir <HI>Robert</HI> got me a good Mortga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for 2200 <HI>l.</HI> at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest: So I had 132 <HI>l.</HI> a Year added to my Income, which was a very satisfying Article.</P>
<P>But I return to my History: As I have said, I found that my Measures were all wrong, the Posture I set up in, expos'd me to innumerable Visiters of the Kind I have mention'd above; I was cry'd up for a vast For∣tune, and one that Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> manag'd for; and Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> was courted for me, as much as I was for myself: But I had given Sir <HI>Robert</HI> his Cue; I had told him my Opinion of Matrimony, in just the same Terms as I had done my Merchant, and he came
<PB N="179" REF="177"/>
into it presently; he own'd that my Observation was just, and that if I valued my Liberty, as I knew my Fortune, and that it was in my own Hands, I was to blame, if I gave it away to any one.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Robert</HI> knew nothing of my Design; that I aim'd at being a kept Mistress, and to have a handsome Maintenance; and that I was still for getting Money, and laying it up too, as much as he cou'd desire me, only by a worse Way.</P>
<P>However, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came seriously to me one Day, and told me, he had an Offer of Matrimony to make to me, that was beyond all that he had heard had of∣fer'd themselves, and this was a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and I agreed exactly in our Notions of a Merchant: Sir <HI>Robert</HI> said, and I found it to be true, that a true b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Merchant is the best Gentleman in the Nation: that in Knowledge, in Manners, in Judgment of things, the Merchant out did many of the Nobility; that hav∣ing once master'd the World, and being above the De∣mand of Business, tho' no real Estate, they were then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>perior to most Gentlemen, even in Estate; that a Merchant in flesh Business, and a capital Stock, is able to spend more Money than a Gentleman of <HI>5000l.</HI> a Year Estate; that while a Merchant spent, he only spent what he got, and not that; and that he laid up great Sums every Year.</P>
<P>That an Estate is a Pond; but that a Trade was a Spring; that if the first is once mortgag'd, it seldom gets clear, but embarrass'd the Person for ever; but the Merchant had his Estate continually flowing; and open this, he nam'd me Merchants who liv'd in more real Splendor, and spent more Money than most of the Noblemen in <HI>England</HI> cou'd singly expend, and that they full grew immensely rich.</P>
<P>He went on to tell me, that even the Tradsemen in <HI>London,</HI> speaking of the better Sort of Trades, cou'd spend more Money in their Families, and give better Fortunes to their Children, than, generally speaking, the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>1000l.</HI> a Year down∣ward, cou'd do, and yet grow rich too.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="178"/>
The Upshot of all this was, to recommend to me, rather the bestowing my Fortune upon some eminent Merchant, who liv'd already in the first Figure of a Merchant, and who not being in Want or Scarcity of Money, but having a flourishing Business, and a flow∣ing Cash, wou'd at the first Word, settle all my For∣tune on myself and Children, and maintain me like a Queen.</P>
<P>This was certainly right; and had I taken his Ad∣vice, I had really been happy; but my Heart was bent upon an Independency of Fortune; and I told him, I knew no State of Matrimony, but what was, at best, a State of Inferiority, if not of Bondage; that I had no Notion of it; that I liv'd a Life of absolute Liberty now; was free as I was born, and having a plentiful Fortune, I did not understand what Coherence the Words <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> had with the Liberty of a <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Woman;</HI> that I knew no Reason the Men had to engross the whole Liberty of the Race, and make the Women, notwithstanding any Desparity of Fortune, be subject to the Laws of Marriage, of their own making; that it was my Misfortune to be a Woman, but I was re∣solv'd it should not be made worse by the Sex; and see∣ing Liberty seem'd to be the Men's Property, I wou'd be a <HI>Man Woman;</HI> for as I was born free, I wou'd die so</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> smil'd, and told me, I talk'd a kind of <HI>Amaz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian</HI> Language; that he found few Women of my Mind, or that if they were, they wanted Resolution to go on with it; that notwithstanding all my Notions, which he could not but say had once some Weight in them, yet he understood I had broke in upon them, and had been marry'd. I answer'd, I had so, but he did not hear me say, that I had any Encouragement from what was past, to make a second Venture; that I'was got well out of the Toil, and if I came in again I should have no body to blame but myself.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> laugh'd heartily at me, but gave over of∣fering any more Arguments, only told me, he had pointed me out for some of the best Merchants in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>

but since I forbad him, he wou'd give me no Dis∣turbance of that Kind; he applauded my Way of ma∣naging my Money, and told me, I shou'd soon be monstrous rich; but he neither knew, or mistrusted, that with all this Wealth, I was yet a Whore, and was not averse to adding to my Estate at the farther Expence of my Virtue.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Story as to my Way of living; I found, as above, that my living as I did wou'd not answer; that it only brought the <HI>Fortune-hunters</HI> and Bites about me, as I have said before, to make a Prey of me and my Money; and in short, I was harrass'd with Lovers, <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Fops</HI> of Quality, in abundance; but it wou'd not do, I aim'd at other Things, and was possess'd with so vain an Opinion of my own Beauty, that nothing less than a KING himself was in my Eye; and this Vanity was rais'd by some Words let fall by a Person I convers'd with, who was, perhaps, likely enough to have brought such a Thing to pass, had it been sooner; <HI>but that Game began to be pretty well over at Court:</HI> However, the having mention'd such a thing, it seems, a little too publickly, it brought abundance of People about me, upon a wicked Account too.</P>
<P>And now I began to act in a new Sphere; the Court was exceeding gay <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fine, tho' fuller of Men than of Women, the Queen not affecting to be very much in publick; on the other Hand, it is no Slander upon the Courtiers, to say, they were as wicked as any body in Reason cou'd desire them: The KING had several Mistresses, who were prodigious sine, and there was a glorious Show on that Side indeed: If the Sovereign give himself a Loose, it cou'd not be expected the rest of the Court shou'd be all Saints; so far was it from that though I wou'd not make it worse than it was, that a Woman that had any Thing agreeable in her Ap∣pearance, cou'd never want Followers.</P>
<P>I soon found myself throng'd with Admirers, and I receiv'd Visits from some Persons of very great Figure, who always introduc'd themselves by the help of an old Lady or two, who were now become my Intimates;
<PB N="182" REF="180"/>
and one of them, I understood afterwards, was set to work on purpose to get into my Favour, in order to in∣troduce what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Conversation we had, was generally courtly, but civil, at length, some Gentlemen propos'd to Play, and made, what they call'd, a Party; this it seems, was a Contrivance of one of my Female Hangers-on, <HI>for, as I said, I had two of them,</HI> who thought this was the Way to introduce People as often as she pleas'd, and so indeed, it was, They play'd high, and stay'd late, but begg'd my Pardon, only ask'd Leave to make an Appointment for the next Night. I was as gay, and as well pleas'd as any of them, and one Night told one of the Gentlemen, my Lord—, that seeing they were doing me the Honour of diverting themselves at my Apartment, and desir'd to be there sometimes, I did not keep a Gaming Table, but I wou'd give them a little Ball the next Day, if they pleas'd; which they accepted very willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Evening the Gentlemen began to come, where I let them see, that I understood very well what such Things meant: I had a large Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ing Room in my Apartments, with five other Rooms in the same Floor, all which I made Drawing Rooms for the Occasion, having all the Beds taken down for the Day; in three of these I had Tables plac'd, co∣ver'd with Wine and Sweet-meats; the fourth had a green Table for Play, and the fifth was my own Room, where I sat, and where I receiv'd all the Company that came to pay their Compliments to me: I was dress'd, you may be sure to all the Advantage possible, and had all the Jewels on, that I was Mistress of: My Lord—, to whom I made the Invitation, sent me a Sett of fine Musick from the Play-House, and the La∣dies danc'd, and we began to be very merry; when about eleven a Clock, I had Notice given me, that there were some Gentlemen coming in Masquerade.</P>
<P>I seem'd a little surpriz'd, and began to apprehend some Disturbance; when my Lord—perceiving it, spoke to me to be easy, for that there was a Party of
<PB N="183" REF="181"/>
the Guards at the Door, which shou'd be ready to pre∣vent any Rudeness; and another Gentleman gave me a Hint, as if the KING was among the Masks; I colour∣ed as red as Blood itself cou'd make a Face look, and express'd a great Surprize; however, there was no go∣ing back; so I kept my Station in my Drawing-room, but with the Folding doors wide open.</P>
<P>A while after, the Masks came in, and began with a Dance <HI>a la Comique,</HI> performing wonderfully indeed: while they were dancing, I withdrew, and left a Lady to answer for me, that I wou'd return immediately; in less than half an Hour I return'd, dress'd in the Habit of <HI>a Turkish Princess;</HI> the Habit I got at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when my <HI>Foreign Prince</HI> bought me a <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, as I have sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>these</HI> Man of War had, it seems, taken a <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessel going from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in which were some Ladies bound for <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and as the Ladies were made Slaves, so their fine Cloaths were thus expos'd; and with this <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, I bought the rich Cloaths too: The Dress was extraordinary fine indeed, I had bought it as a Curiosi∣ty, having never seen the like; the Robe was a fine <HI>Persian,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Damask; the Ground white, and the Flowers blue and gold, and the Train held five Yards; the Dress under it, was a Vest of the same, embroider'd with Gold, and set with some Pearl in the Work, and some <HI>Turquois</HI> Stones; to the Vest, was a Girdle five or six Inches wide, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mode; and on both Ends where it join'd, or hook'd, was set with Diamonds for eight Inches either Way, only they were not true Diamonds; but no body knew that but myself.</P>
<P>The Turban, or Head-Dress, had a Pinacle on the Top, but not above five Inches, with a Piece of loose Sarcenet hanging from it; and on the Front, just over the Forehead, was a good Jewel, which I had added to it.</P>
<P>This Habit, as above, cost me about sixty Pistoles in <HI>Italy,</HI> but cost much more in the Country from whence it came; and little did I think, when I bought
<PB N="184" REF="182"/>
it, that I shou'd put it to such a Use as this; tho' I had dress'd myself in it many Times, by the help of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> and afterwards between <HI>Amy</HI> and I, only to see how I look'd in it: I had sent her up before, to get it ready, and when I came up, I had nothing to do but to slip it on, and was down in my Drawing-Room in a little more than a quarter of an Hour. When I came there, the Room was full of Company, but I order'd the Folding-Doors to be shut for a Minute or two, till I had receiv'd the Compliments of the Ladies that were in the Room, and had given them a full View of my Dress.</P>
<P>But my Lord—, who happen'd to be in the Room, slipp'd out at another Door, and brought back with him one of the Masks, a tall well-shap'd Person, but who had no Name, being all mask'd, nor would it have been allow'd to ask any Person's Name on such an Occasion; the Person spoke in <HI>French</HI> to me, that it was the finest Dress he had ever seen; and ask'd me, if he shou'd have the Honour to dance with me? I bow'd, as giving my Consent, but said, As I had been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> I cou'd not dance after the Manner of this Country; I suppos'd their Musick wou'd not play <HI>a la Moresque:</HI> he answer'd merrily, I had a Christian's Face, and he'd venture it, that I cou'd dance like a Christian; adding, that so much Beauty cou'd not be <HI>Mahometan:</HI> immediately the Folding-doors were flung open, and he led me into the Room: The Company were under the greatest Surprize imaginable; the ve∣ry Musick stopp'd a while to gaze; for the Dress was indeed exceedingly surprizing, perfectly new, very agreeable, and wonderful rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, whoever he was, for I never knew, led me only a Courant, and then ask'd me, if I had a Mind to dance an Antick, that is to say, whether I wou'd dance the Antick as they had danc'd in Masque∣rade, or any Thing by myself; I told him any Thing else rather, if he pleas'd; so we danc'd only two <HI>French</HI> Dances, and he led me to the Drawing-room Door, when he retir'd to the rest of the Masks: When he left
<PB N="185" REF="183"/>
me at the Drawing-room Door, I did not go in, as he thought I wou'd have done, but turn'd about, and show'd myself to the whole Room, and calling my Wo∣man to me, gave her some Directions to the Musick, by which the Company presently understood that I would give them a Dance by myself: Immediately all the House rose up, and paid me a kind of a Compliment, by removing back every Way to make me Room, for the Place was exceeding full; the Musick did not at first hit the Tune that I directed, which was a <HI>French</HI> Tune, so I was forc'd to send my Woman to them a∣gain, standing all this while at my Drawing-room Door; but as soon as my Woman spoke to them again, they play'd it right; and I, to let them see it was so, stepp'd forward to the middle of the Room; then they began it again, and I danc'd by myself a Figure which I learnt in <HI>France,</HI> when the Prince <HI>de—</HI>desir'd I wou'd dance for his Diversion; it was indeed, a very fine Figure, invented by a famous Master at <HI>Paris,</HI> for a Lady or Gentleman to dance single; but being per∣fectly new, it pleas'd the Company exceedingly, and they all thought it had been <HI>Turkish;</HI> nay, one Gen∣man had the Folly to expose himself so much as to say, and I think swore too, that he had seen it danc'd at <HI>Constantinop'e;</HI> which was ridiculous enough.</P>
<P>At the finishing the Dance, the Company clapp'd, and almost shouted; and one of the Gentlemen cry'd out, <HI>Roxana! Roxana!</HI> by—, with an Oath; upon which foolish Accident I had the Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> presently fix'd upon me all over the Court End of the Town, as effectually as if I had been Christen'd <HI>Roxana.</HI> I had, it seems, the Felicity of pleasing every Body that Night, to an Extreme; and my Ball, but especi∣cially my Dress, was the Chat of the Town for that Week, and so the Name <HI>Roxana</HI> was the Toast at and about the Court; no other Health was to be nam'd with it.</P>
<P>Now Things began to work as I wou'd have them, and I began to be very popular, as much as I cou'd desire: The Ball held till (as well as I was pleas'd with the Show) I was sick of the Night; the Gentle∣men
<PB N="186" REF="184"/>
mask'd went off about three a Clock in the Morn∣ing, the other Gentlemen sat down to Play; the Musick held it out; and some of the Ladies were dancing at Six in the Morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was that danc'd with me; some of the Lords went so far as to tell me, I was very much honour'd in my Compa∣ny; one of them spoke so broad, as almost to say is was the KING, but I was convinc'd afterwards, it was not; and another reply'd, If he had been his Majesty, he shou'd have thought it no Dishonour to lead up a <HI>Roxana;</HI> but to this Hour I never knew positively who it was; and by his Behaviour I thought he was too young, His Majesty being at that Time in an Age that might be discover'd from a young Person, even in his Dancing.</P>
<P>Be that as it wou'd, I had 500 Guineas sent me the next Morning, and the Messenger was order'd to tell me, that the Persons who sent it, desir'd a Ball again at my Lodgings on the next <HI>Tuesday,</HI> but that they wou'd have my Leave to give the Entertainment them∣selves: I was mighty well pleas'd with this (to be sure) but very inquisitive to know who the Money came from; but the Messenger was silent as Death as to that Point; and bowing always at my Enquiries, begg'd me to ask no Questions which he cou'd not give an obliging Answer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that play'd, gave an hundred Guineas to the Box, as they call'd it, and at the End of their Play, they ask'd for my Gentle∣woman of the Bed Chamber, as they call'd her, (Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> forsooth) and gave it her; and gave twenty Gui∣neas more among the Servants.</P>
<P>This magnificent Doings equally both pleas'd and surpriz'd me, and I hardly knew where I was: but especially, that Notion of the KING being the Person that danc'd with me, puff'd me up to that Degree, that I not only did not know any-body else, but indeed, was very far from knowing myself.</P>
<P>I had now the next <HI>Tuesday</HI> out to provide for the like
<PB N="187" REF="185"/>
Company; but alas! it was all taken out of my Hand; three Gentlemen, who yet were, it seems, but Servants, came on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> and bringing sufficient Testimo∣nies that they were right, for one was the same who brought the five hundred Guineas; I say, three of them came, and brought Bottles of all Sorts of Wines, and Hampers of Sweet-meats to such a Quantity, it appear∣ed they design'd to hold the Trade on more than once, and that they would furnish every Thing to a Pro∣fusion.</P>
<P>However, as I found a Deficiency in two Things, I made Provision of about twelve Dozen of fine Damask Napkins, with Table cloaths of the same, sufficient to cover all the Tables, with three Table-cloaths upon every Table, and Side-boards in Proportion; I also bought a handsome Quantity of Plate, necessary to have serv'd all the Side-boards, but the Gentlemen would not suffer any of it to be us'd, telling me, they had bought fine <HI>China</HI> Dishes and Plates for the whole Service, and that in such publick Places they cou'd not be answerable for the Plate; so it was set all up in a large Glass-Cupboard in the Room I sat in, where it made a very good Show indeed.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> there came such an Appearance of Gentle∣men and Ladies, that my Apartments were by no Means able to receive them; and those who in particu∣lar appear'd as Principals, gave Order below, to let no more Company come up; the Street was full of Coach∣es with Coronets, and fine Glass Chairs; and in short, it was impossible to receive the Company. I kept my little Room, as before, and the Dancers fill'd the great Room; all the Drawing-Rooms also were fill'd, and three Rooms below Stairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>It was very well that there was a strong Party of the Guards brought to keep the Door, for without that, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had been such a promiscuous Crowd, and some of them scandalous too, that we shou'd have been all Dis∣order and Confusion; but the three Head Servants ma∣nag'd all that, and had a Word to admit all the Com∣pany by.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="186"/>
It was uncertain to me, and is to this Day, who it was that danc'd with me the <HI>Wednesday</HI> before, when the Ball was my own; but that the K—was at this As∣sembly, was out of Question with me, by Cir∣cumstances that I suppose I could not be deceived in; and particularly, that there were five Persons who were not mask'd, three of them had blue Gar∣ters, and they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This Meeting was manag'd just as the first, tho' with much more Magnificence, because of the Company. I plac'd myself (exceedingly rich in Cloaths and Jewels) in the middle of my little Room, as before, and made my Compliment to all the Company, as they pass'd me, as I did before; but my Lord—, who had spoken openly to me the first Night, came to me, and unmask∣ing told me the Company had order'd him to tell me, they hop'd they should see me in the Dress I had ap∣peared in the first Day, which had been so acceptable, that it had been the Occasion of this new Meeting; and Madam, <HI>says he,</HI> there are some in this Assembly, who it is worth your while to oblige.</P>
<P>I bow'd to my Lord—, and immediately with∣drew. While I was above, a dressing in my new Habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me, were convey'd into my Apartment below, by the Order of a noble Per∣son, who, with his whole Family had been in <HI>Persia;</HI> and here indeed I thought I should have been out-done, or perhaps baulk'd.</P>
<P>One of these Ladies was dress'd most exquisitely fine indeed, in the Habit of a Virgin Lady of Quality of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the other in the same Habit of <HI>Armenia,</HI> with each of them a Woman-slave to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their Petticoats short to their Ancles, but pleated all round, and before them short Aprons, but of the finest Point that could be seen, their Gown, were made with long antic Sleeves hanging down behind, and a Train let down; they had no Jewels, but their Heads and Breasts were dress'd up with Flowers, and they both came in veil'd.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="187"/>
Their Slaves were <HI>bare-headed,</HI> but their long black Hair was breeded in Locks hanging down behind to their Wastes, and tied up with Ribbons; they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dress'd exceeding rich, and were as beautiful as their Mistresses; for none of them had any Masks on. They waited in my Room till I came down, and all paid their Respects to me after the <HI>Persian</HI> Manner, and sat down on a <HI>Safra,</HI> that is to say, almost cross-legg'd on a Couch made up of Cushions laid on the Ground.</P>
<P>This was admirably fine, and I was indeed startled at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. They made their Compliment to me in <HI>French,</HI> and I reply'd in the same Language. When the Doors were opened, they walked into the Dancing-room, and danc'd such a Dance as indeed no Body there had ever seen, and to an Instrument like a Guittar, with a small low sound∣ing Trumpet, which indeed was very fine, and which my Lord—had provided.</P>
<P>They danc'd three Times all alone, for no Body in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed could dance with them. The Novelty pleased truly, but yet there was something wild and <HI>Bizarre</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, because they really acted to the Life the barbarous Country whence they came; but as mine had the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Dress, it was every Way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s new, and pleased much better indeed.</P>
<P>So soon as they had shewn their <HI>Georgian</HI> and <HI>Armeni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> Shapes, and danc'd, as I have said, three Times, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey withdrew, paid their Compliment to me, (for I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as Queen of the Day) and went off to undress.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danc'd with Ladies all in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lasks, and when they stopp'd, no Body rose up to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, but all call'd out <HI>Roxana, Roxana;</HI> in the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erval, my Lord—had brought another mask'd Person into my Room, whom I knew not, only that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould discern it was not the same Person that led me out before. This noble Person (for I afterwards understood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was the Duke of—) after a short Compliment, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed me out into the middle of the Room.</P>
<P>I was dress'd in the same Vest and Girdle, as before; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Robe had a Mantle over it, which is usual in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit, and it was of Crimson and of Green, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Green brocaded with Gold; and my <HI>Tyhiaai,</HI> or
<PB N="190" REF="188"/>
<HI>Head-dress,</HI> vary'd a little from that I had before, as it stood higher, and had some Jewels about the rising Part, which made it look like a Turban crown'd.</P>
<P>I had no Mask, neither did I paint, and yet I had the Day of all the Ladies that appear'd at the Ball, I mean, of those that appeared with Faces on; as for those mask'd, nothing could be said of them, no doubt there might be many finer than I was; it must be con∣fess'd that the Habit was infinitely advantageous to me, and every Body look'd at me with a kind of Pleasure, which gave me great Advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danc'd with that noble Person, I did not offer to dance by myself, as I had before; but they all call'd out <HI>Roxana</HI> again; and two of the Gentlemen came into the Drawing-room, to intreat me to give them the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dance, which I yielded to readily, so I came out and danc'd just as at first.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceiv'd five Persons stand∣ing all together, and among them one only with his Hat on; it was an immediate Hint to me who it was, and had at first almost put me into some Disorder; but I went on, receiv'd the Applause of the House, as be∣fore, and retir'd into my own Room; when I was there the five Gentlemen came cross the Room to my Side, and coming in, followed by a Throng of great Persons, the Person with his Hat on, said, Madam <HI>Roxana,</HI> you <HI>perform to Admiration.</HI> I was prepar'd, and offer'd to kneel to kiss his Hand, but he declin'd it, and saluted me, and so passing back again thro' the great Room, went away.</P>
<P>I do not say here who this was, but I say, I came af∣terwards to know something more plainly. I would have withdrawn, and disrob'd, being somewhat too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in that Dress, unlac'd and open-breasted, as if I had been in my Shift; but it could not be, and I was ob∣lig'd to dance afterwards with six or eight Gentlemen, most, if not all of them, of the first Rank; and I was told afterwards, that one of them was the D—of <HI>M—th.</HI></P>
<P>About two or three o'Clock in the Morning the Com∣pany began to decrease, the Number of Women especi∣cially
<PB N="191" REF="189"/>
dropp'd away Home, some and some at a Time; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Gentlemen retired down Stairs, where they un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sk'd and went to Play.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Room where they played, sat up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Night to attend them, and in the Morning when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey broke up they swept the Box into her Lap, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he counted out to me sixty two Guineas and a half; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other Servants got very well too. <HI>Amy</HI> came to me then they were all gone, <HI>Law—Madam,</HI> says <HI>Amy,</HI> with a long gaping Cry, <HI>what shall I do with all this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oney?</HI> And indeed the poor Creature was half mad <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith Joy.</P>
<P>I was now in my Element; I was as much talk'd of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any Body could desire, and I did not doubt but some∣thing or other would come of it, but the Report of my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing so rich rather was a Baulk to my View than any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing else, for the Gentlemen that would perhaps have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een: routlesome enough otherwise, seem'd to be kept <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for <HI>Roxana</HI> was too high for them.</P>
<P>There is a Scene which came in here, which I must over from human Eyes or Ears; for three Years and a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a Month <HI>Roxana</HI> lived retir'd, having been oblig'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> make an Excursion in a Manner, and with a Person <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich Duty and private Vows obliges her not to reveal, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> least, not yet.</P>
<P>At the End of this Time I appeared again; but I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit add, that as I had in this Time of Retreat, <HI>made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay,</HI> &amp;c.—so I did not come abroad again with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same Lustre, or shine with so much Advantage as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore; for as some People had got at least a Suspicion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where I had been, and who had had me all the while, began to be public that <HI>Roxana</HI> was, in short, a meer <HI>Roxana,</HI> neither better nor worse, and not that Woman Honour and Virtue that was at first suppos'd.</P>
<P>You are now to suppose me about seven Years come Town, and that I had not only suffered the old Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nue, which I hinted was manag'd by Sir <HI>Robert Clay∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> to grow, as was mentioned before; but I had laid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an incredible Wealth, the Time considered; and had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et had the least Thought of reforming, I had all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>portunity to do it with Advantage that ever Woman
<PB N="192" REF="190"/>
had; for the common Vice of all Whores, I mean Money was out of the Question, nay, even Avarice it∣self seem'd to be glutted; for, including what I had sav'd in reserving the Interest of 14000 <HI>l.</HI> which, as a∣bove, I had left to grow; and including some very good Presents I had made to me in meer Compliment, upon these shining masquerading Meetings, which I held up for about two Years, and what I made of three Years of the most glorious Retreat, <HI>as I call it,</HI> that ever Wo∣man had, I had fully doubled my first Substance, and had near 5000 Pounds in Money, which I kept at Home; besides Abundance of Plate and Jewels, which I had either given me, or had bought to set myself out for public Days.</P>
<P>In a Word, I had now five and thirty thousand Pounds Estate; and as I found Ways to live without wasting either Principal or Interest, I laid up 2000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year at least out of the meer Interest, adding it to the Prin∣cipal; and thus I went on.</P>
<P>After the End of what I call my Retreat, and out of which I brought a great deal of Money, I appeared a∣gain, but I seem'd like an old Piece of Plate that had been hoarded up some Years, and comes out tarnish'd and discolour'd; so I came out blown, and look'd like <HI>a cast-off Mistress,</HI> nor indeed was I any better; tho' I was not at all impair'd in Beauty, except that I was a little fatter than I was formerly, and always granting that I was four Years older.</P>
<P>However, I preserv'd the Youth of my Temper; wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always bright, pleasant in Company, and agreeable to every Body, or else every Body flatter'd me; and in this Condition I came abroad to the World again; and tho' I was not so popular as before, and indeed did not seek it, because I knew it could not be; yet I was fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from being without Company, and that of the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Quality, <HI>of Subjects I mean,</HI> who frequently visited me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sometimes we had Meetings for Mirth and Play a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Apartments, where I sail'd not to divert them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most agreeable Manner possible.</P>
<P>Nor could any of them make the least particular Ap∣plication to me from the Notion they had of my exce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣five
<PB N="193" REF="191"/>
Wealth, which, as they thought, plac'd me above the Meanness of a Maintenance, and so left no Room to come easily about me.</P>
<P>But at last I was very handsomely attack'd by a Per∣son of Honour, and (which recommended him particu∣larly to me) a Person of a very great Estate; he made a long Introduction to me upon the Subject of my Wealth. Ignorant Creature! <HI>said I to myself,</HI> considering him as a LORD, was there ever Woman in the World that could stoop to the Baseness of being a Whore, and was above taking the Reward of her Vice! <HI>No, no, depend upon it, if your Lordship obtains any Thing of me you must pay for it; and the Notion of my being so rich serves only to make it cost you the dearer, seeing you cannot offer a small Matter to a Woman of</HI> 2000 l. <HI>a Year Estate.</HI></P>
<P>After he had harrangu'd upon that Subject a good while, and had assur'd me he had no Design upon me, that he did not come to make a Prize of me, or to pick my Pocket, which (by the Way) I was in no Fear of, for I took too much Care of my Money, to part with any of it that Way; he then turn'd his Discourse to the Subject of Love; a Point so ridiculous to me, without the main Thing, I mean the Money, that I had no Pa∣tience to hear him make so long a Story of it.</P>
<P>I receiv'd him civilly, and let him see I could bear to hear a wicked Proposal, without being affronted, and yet I was not to be brought into it too easily. He visit∣ed me a long while, and in short courted me as closely and assiduously, as if he had been wooing me to Matri∣mony; he made me several valuable Presents, which I suffer'd myself to be prevail'd with to accept, but not without great Difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I suffer'd all his other Importunities, and when he made a Proposal of a Compliment, or Appoint∣ment to me for a Settlement, <HI>he said,</HI> That tho' I was rich, yet there was not the less due from him to acknow∣ledge the Favours he received; and that if I was to be his I should not live at my own Expence, <HI>cost what it would.</HI> I told him I was far from being extravagant, and yet I did not live at the Expence of less than 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year out of my own Pocket; that however, I was
<PB N="194" REF="192"/>
not covetous of settled Allowances, for I look'd upon that as a kind of <HI>Golden Chain,</HI> something like Matri∣mony; that tho' I knew how to be true to a Man of Honour, as I knew his Lordship to be, yet I had a kind of Aversion to the Bonds; and tho' I was not so rich as the World talk'd me up to be, yet I was not so poor as to bind myself to Hardships for a Pension.</P>
<P>He told me he expected to make my Life perfectly easy, and intended it so; that he knew of no Bondage there could be in a private Engagement between us; that the Bonds of Honour he knew I would be ty'd by, and think them no Burthen, and for other Obligations, he scorn'd to expect any Thing from me, but what he knew, as a Woman of Honour, I could grant; then as to Maintenance he told me he would soon shew me that he valued me infinitely above 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; and upon this Foot we began.</P>
<P>I seem'd kinder to him after this Discourse; and as Time and private Conversation made us very intimate, we began to come nearer to the main Article, <HI>namely,</HI> the 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; he offer'd that at first Word, and to ac∣knowledge it as an infinite Favour to have it be accepted of; and I, that thought it was too much by all the Mo∣ney, suffer'd myself to be master'd or prevail'd with to yield, even on but a bare Engagement upon Parole.</P>
<P>When he had obtained his End that Way, I told him my Mind: Now you see, my Lord, <HI>said I,</HI> how weak∣ly I have acted, <HI>namely,</HI> to yield to you without any Ca∣pitulation, or any Thing secur'd to me, but that which you may cease to allow when you please; if I am the less valued for such a Confidence, I shall be injur'd in a Man∣ner that I will endeavour not to deserve.</P>
<P>He told me that he would make it evident to me, that he did not seek me by Way of Bargain, as such Things were often done; that as I had treated him with a ge∣nerous Confidence, so I should find I was in the Hands of a Man of Honour, and one that knew how to value the Obligation; and upon this he pull'd out a Gold∣smith's Bill for 300 <HI>l.</HI> which, putting it into my Hand, he said he gave me as a Pledge, that I should not be
<PB N="195" REF="193"/>
a Loser by my not having made a Bargain with him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave me a good Idea of our future Correspondence; and, in short, as I could not resrain treating him with more Kindness than I had done before, so one Thing begeting another, I gave him several Testimonies that I was entirely his own by Inclination, as well as by the common Obligation of a Mistress; and this pleased him exceedingly.</P>
<P>Soon after this private Engagement, I began to con∣sider whether it were not more suitable to the Manner of Life I now led, to be a little less public; and as I told my Lord it would rid me of the Importunities of others, and of continual Visits from a Sort of People who he knew of, and who, by the Way, having now got the Notion of me which I really deserved, began to talk of the old Game, Love and Gallantry, and to offer at what was rude enough; Things as nauseous to me now as if I had been married, and as virtuous as other Folks: The Visits of these People began indeed to be uneasy to me, and particularly, as they were always very tedious and impertinent; nor could my Lord—be pleased with them at all, if they had gone on. It would be di∣verting to set down here in what Manner I repuls'd those Sort of People; how in some I resented it as an Affront, and told them, that I was sorry they should oblige me to vindicate myself from the Scandal of such Suggesti∣ons, by telling them, that <HI>I could see them no more,</HI> and by desiring them not to give themselves the Trouble of visiting me, who (tho' I was not willing to be uncivil) yet thought myself obliged never to receive a Visit from any Gentleman after he had made such Proposals at those to me: But these Things would be too tedious to bring in here; it was on this Account I proposed to his Lordship my taking new Lodgings for Privacy; be∣sides, I considered that as I might live very handsomely, and yet not so publickly, so I needed not spend so much Money by a great deal; and if I made 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year of this generous Person, it was more than I had Occasion for.</P>
<P>My Lord came readily into this Proposal, and went farther than I expected; for he found out a Lodging
<PB N="196" REF="194"/>
for me in a very handsome House, where yet he was not known; I suppose he had employed somebody to find it out for him; and where he had a convenient Way to come into the Garden by a Door that opened into the Park, a Thing very rarely allowed in those Times.</P>
<P>By this Key he could come in at what Time of Night or Day he pleased; and as we had also a little Door in the lower Part of the House, which was always left up∣on the Lock, and his was the Master-Key, so if it was twelve, one, or two o' Clock in the Morning, he could come directly into my Bed-chamber. <HI>N. B.</HI> I was not afraid I should be found a Bed with any Body else, for, in a Word, I conversed with no Body at all.</P>
<P>It happened pleasantly enough one Night; his Lord∣ship had staid late, and I not expecting him that Night, had taken <HI>Amy</HI> to Bed with me, and when my Lord came into the Chamber we were both fast asleep, I think it was near three o' Clock when he came in, and a little merry, but not at all fuddl'd, or what they call in Drink; and he came at once into the Room.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was frighted out of her Wits, and cry'd cut. <HI>I said calmly,</HI> indeed my Lord I did not expect you to Night, and we have been a little frighted to Night with Fire. O! <HI>says he,</HI> I see you have got a Bed-fellow with you; I began to make an Apology, <HI>No, no, says my Lord,</HI> you need no Excuse, 'tis not a Man-bed-fellow I see; but then talking merrily enough, he catch'd his Words back; but hark ye, <HI>says he,</HI> now I think on't, how shall I be satisfied it is not a Man-bed-fellow? O, <HI>says I,</HI> I dare say your Lordship is satisfy'd 'tis poor <HI>A∣my;</HI> yes, <HI>says he,</HI> 'tis Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> but how do I know what <HI>Amy</HI> is? It may be Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> for ought I know; I hope you'll give me Leave to be satisfy'd: I told him, Yes, by all Means I would have his Lordship satisfied, but I supposed he knew who she was.</P>
<P>Well, he fell foul of poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and indeed I thought once he would have carryed the Jest on before my Face, as was once done in a like Case; but his Lordship was not so hot neither; but he would know whether <HI>Amy</HI> was Mr. <HI>Amy</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and so I suppose he did;
<PB N="197" REF="195"/>
and then being satisfy'd in that doubtful Case, he walk∣ed to the farther End of the Room, and went into a little Closer and sat down.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Amy</HI> and I got up, and I bid her run and make the Bed in another Chamber for my Lord, and I gave her Sheets to put into it; which she did im∣mediately, and I put my Lord to Bed there; and when I had done, at his Desire, went to Bed to him. I was backward at first to come to Bed to him, and made my Excuse, because I had been in Bed with <HI>Amy,</HI> and had not shifted me, but he was past those Niceties at that Time; and as long as he was sure it was Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and not Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> he was very well satisfied, and so the Jest pass'd over; but <HI>Amy</HI> appeared no more all that Night, or the next Day, and when she did my Lord was so merry with her upon his <HI>Eclaircissment,</HI> as he call'd it, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not know what to do with herself.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Amy</HI> was such a Nice Lady in the main, if she had been fairly dealt with, as has appeared in the former Part of this Work; but now she was surpriz'd, and a little hurried, that she scarce knew where she was; and besides, she was, as to his Lordship, as nice a Lady as any in the World, and for any Thing he knew of her, she appeared as such. The rest was to us only that knew of it.</P>
<P>I held this wicked Scene of Life out eight Years, rec∣koning from my first coming to <HI>England;</HI> and tho' my Lord found no Fault, yet I found, without much exa∣mining, that any one who look'd in my. Face might see I was above twenty Years old, and yet without flatter∣ing myself, I carried my Age, which was above fifty, very well too.</P>
<P>I may venture to say that no Woman ever liv'd a Life like me, of six and twenty Years of Wickedness, without the least Signals of Remorse, without any Signs of Re∣pentance, or without so much as a Wish to put an End to it; I had so long habituated myself to a Life of Vice, that really it appeared to be no Vice to me. I went on smooth and pleasant, I wallow'd in Wealth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t slow'd in upon me at such a Rate, having taken the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rugal Measures that the good Knight directed, that
<PB N="198" REF="196"/>
I had at the End of the eight Years two thousand eight hundred Pounds coming yearly in, of which I did not spend one Penny, being maintain'd by my Allowance from my Lord—, and more than maintain'd by above 200 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Annum;</HI> for tho' he did not contract for 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, as I made dumb Signs to have it be, yet he gave me Money so often, and that in such large Parcels, that I had seldom so little as seven or eight hun∣dred Pounds a Year of him, one Year with another.</P>
<P>I must go back here, after telling openly the wicked Things I did to mention something, which however, had the Face of doing Good; I remembered that when I went from <HI>England,</HI> which was fifteen Years before, I had left five little Children, turn'd out, as it were, to the wide World, and the Charity of their Father's Rela∣tions; the eldest was not six Years old, for we had not been marry'd full seven Years when their Father went away.</P>
<P>After my coming to <HI>England,</HI> I was greatly desirous to hear how Things stood with them; and whether they were all alive or not, and in what Manner they had been maintain'd; and yet I resolved not to discover myself to them in the least; or to let any of the People that had the breeding of them up know that there was such a Body left in the World as their Mother.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Body I could trust with such a Com∣mission, and I sent her into <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> to the old Aunt, and to the poor Woman that were so instrumental in disposing the Relations to take some Care of the Chil∣dren, but they were both gone, dead and buried some Years. The next Enquiry she made was at the House where she carry'd the poor Children, and turn'd them in at the Door; when she came there she found the House inhabited by other People, so that she could make little or nothing of her Enquiries, and came back with an Answer, that indeed was no Answer to me, for it gave me no Satisfaction at all. I sent her back to en∣quire in the Neighbourhood, what was become of the Family that liv'd in that House? and if they were re∣moved, where they lived? and what Circumstances they were in? and withal, if she could, what became of the
<PB N="199" REF="197"/>
poor Children, and how they liv'd, and where? how they had been treated? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>She brought me back Word upon this second going, that she heard as to the Family, that the Husband, who, tho' but Uncle-in-Law to the Children had yet been kindest to them, was dead; and that the Widow was left but in mean Circumstances, that is to say, she did not want, but that she was not so well in the World as she was thought to be when her Husband was alive.</P>
<P>That as to the poor Children, two of them, it seems, had been kept by her, that is to say, by her Husband, while he liv'd, for that it was against her Will, that we all knew; but the honest Neighbours pitied the poor Children, <HI>they said,</HI> heartily; for that their Aunt us'd them barbarously, and made them little better than Ser∣vants in the House, to wait upon her and her Children, and scarce allow'd them Cloaths fit to wear.</P>
<P>These were, it seems, my eldest and third, which were Daughters; the second was a Son, the fourth a Daughter, and the youngest a Son.</P>
<P>To finish the melancholly Part of this History of my two unhappy Girls, she brought me Word that so soon as they were able to go out, and get any Work, they went from her; and some said she had turned them out of Doors; but it seems she had not done so, but she us'd them so cruelly that they left her; and one of them went to Service to a Neighbour's a little Way off, who knew her, an honest substantial Weaver's Wife, to whom she was Chamber-maid, and in a little Time she took her Sister out of the <HI>Bridewell</HI> of her Aunt's House, and got her a Place too.</P>
<P>This was all melancholly and dull. I sent her then to the Weaver's House, where the eldest had liv'd, but found that her Mistress being dead, she was gone and no Body knew there whither she went, only that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heard she had liv'd with a great Lady at the other End of the Town; but they did not know who that Lady was.</P>
<P>These Enquiries took us up three or four Weeks, and I was not one Jot the better for it, for I could hear no∣thing to my Satisfaction. I sent her next to find out the
<PB N="200" REF="198"/>
honest Man, who, as in the Beginning of my Story I observed made them be entertained, and caused the youngest to be fetch'd from the Town where we liv'd, and where the Parish-Officers had taken Care of them. This Gentleman was still alive; and there she heard that my youngest Daughter and eldest Son was dead al∣so; but that my youngest Son was alive, and was at that Time about seventeen Years old, and that he was put out Apprentice by the Kindness and Charity of his Uncle, but to a mean Trade, at which he was obliged to work very hard.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so curious in this Part, that she went imme∣diately to see him, and found him all dirty, and hard at Work; she had no Remembrance at all of the Youth, for she had not seen him since he was about two Years old; and it was evident he could have no Know∣ledge of her.</P>
<P>However, she talked with him, and found him a good sensible mannerly Youth; that he knew little of the Story of his Father or Mother, and had no View of any Thing, but to work hard for his Living; and she did not think fit to put any great Things into his Head, lest it should take him off of his Business, and perhaps make him turn giddy-headed, and be good for nothing; but she went and found out that kind Man, his Benefactor, who had put him out; and finding him a plain well-meaning, honest, and kind-hearted Man, she opened her Tale to him the easier: She made a long Story, how she had a prodigious Kindness for the Child, because she had the same for his Father and Mother; told him that she was the Servant-maid that brought all of them to their Aunt's Door, and run away and left them; that their poor Mother wanted Bread, and what came of her after she would have been glad to know; she added, that her Circumstances had happened to mend in the World; and that, as she was in Condition, so she was disposed to shew some Kinndess to the Children, if she could find them out.</P>
<P>He received her with all the Civility that so kind a Proposal demanded; gave her an Account what he had done for the Child, how he had maintain'd him, fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="201" REF="199"/>
and cloath'd him, put him to School, and at last, put him out to a Trade; she said, he had indeed been a Fa∣ther to the Child; but Sir, says she, 'tis a very labo∣rious hard-working Trade, and he is but a thin weak Boy; that's true, says he, but the Boy chose the Trade, and I assure you, I gave 20 <HI>l.</HI> with him, and am to find him Cloaths all his Apprenticeship; and as to its being a hard Trade, says he, that's the Fate of his Circumstances, poor Boy; I cou'd not well do better for him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, as you did all for him in Charity, says she, it was exceeding well; but as my Resolution is to do something for him, I desire you will, if possible, take him away again from that Place, where he works so hard, for I cannot bear to see the Child work so very hard for his Bread, and I will do something for him, that shall make him live without such hard Labour.</P>
<P>He smil'd at that; I can indeed, says he, take him away, but then I must lose my 20 <HI>l.</HI> that I gave with him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, said <HI>Amy,</HI> I'll enable you to lose that 20 <HI>l.</HI> immediately, and so she put her Hand in her Pocket, and pulls out her Purse.</P>
<P>He begun to be a little amaz'd at her, and look'd her hard in the Face, and that so very much, that she took Notice of it, and said, Sir, I fancy by your looking at me, you think you know me, but I am as∣sured you do not, for I never saw your Face before; I think you have done enough for the Child, and that you ought to be acknowledg'd as a Father to him, but you ought not to lose by your Kindness to him, more than the Kindness of bringing him up obliges you to; and therefore there's the twenty Pounds, added she, and pray let him be setch'd away.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, says he, I will thank you for the Boy, as well as for myself; but will you please to tell me what I must do with him.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Amy,</HI> as you have been so kind to keep him so many Years, I beg you will take him home again one Year more, and I'll bring you an hundred
<PB N="202" REF="200"/>
Pounds more, which I will desire you to lay out in Schooling and Cloaths for him, and to pay you for his Board; perhaps I may put him in a Condition to re∣turn your Kindness.</P>
<P>He look'd pleas'd, but surpriz'd very much, and enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> but with very great Respect, what he should go to School to learn? and what Trade she would please to put him out to?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> said, he should put him to learn a little <HI>Latin,</HI> and then Merchants Accounts, and to write a good Hand, for she would have him be put to a <HI>Turky</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P>Madam, says he, I am glad for his sake, to hear you talk so; but do you know that a <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant will not take him under 4 or 500 Pounds.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I know it very well.</P>
<P>And, says he, that it will require as many thousands to set him up.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I know that very well too; and resolving to talk very big, she added, I have no Child∣dren of my own, and I resolve to make him my Heir; and if ten thousand Pounds be requir'd to set him up, he shall not want it; I was but his Mother's Servant when he was born, and I mourn'd heartily for the Dis∣after of the Family; and I always said, if ever I was worth any Thing in the World, I wou'd take the Child for my own, and I'll be as good as my Word now, tho' I did not then foresee that it wou'd be with me, as it has been since: And so <HI>Amy</HI> told him a long Story how she was troubled for me; and what she wou'd give to hear whether I was dead or alive, and what Circumstances I was in; that if she cou'd but find me, if I was ever so poor, she wou'd take Care of me, and make a Gen∣tlewoman of me again.</P>
<P>He told her, that as to the Child's Mother, she had been reduc'd to the last Extremity, and was oblig'd (as he suppos'd she knew) to send the Children all among her Husband's Friends; and if it had not been for him, they had been all sent to the Parish; but that he oblig'd the other Relations to share the Charge among them;
<PB N="203" REF="201"/>
that he had taken two, whereof he had lost the eldest, who died of the Small-Pox; but that he had been as careful of this, as of his own, and had made very little Difference in their breeding up; only that when he came to put him out, he thought it best for the Boy, to put him to a Trade which he might set up in with∣out a Stock, for otherwise his Time wou'd be lost; and that as to his Mother, he had never been able to hear one Word of her, no, not tho' he had made the utmost Enquiry after her; that there went a Report, that she had drowned herself; but that he cou'd never meet with any body that cou'd give him a certain Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> counterfeited a Cry for her poor Mistress; told him, she wou'd give any Thing in the World to see her, if she was alive; and a great deal more such like Talk they had about that; then they return'd to speak of the Boy.</P>
<P>He enquired of her, why she did not seek after the Child before, that he might have been brought up from a younger Age, suitable to what she design'd to do for him.</P>
<P>She told him, she had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but newly return'd from the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> That she had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but newly return'd, was true, but the latter was false, and was put in to blind him, and to provide against farther Enquiries; for it was not a strange Thing for young Women to go away poor to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and come Home vastly rich; so she went on with Directions about him, and both agreed in this, that the Boy should by no Means be told what was intended for him, but only that he should be taken home again to his Uncle's, that his Uncle thought the Trade too hard for him, and the like.</P>
<P>About three Days after this, <HI>Amy</HI> goes again, and carry'd him the hundred Pounds she promis'd him, but then <HI>Amy</HI> made quite another Figure than she did be∣fore; for she went in my Coach, with two Footmen after her, and dress'd very fine also, with Jewels and a Gold Watch; and there was indeed, no great Difficul∣ty
<PB N="204" REF="202"/>
to make <HI>Amy</HI> look like a Lady, for she was a very handsome well-shap'd Woman, and genteel enough; the Coachmen and Servants were particularly order'd to show her the same Respect as they wou'd to me, and to call her Madam <HI>Collins,</HI> if they were ask'd any Questions about her.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman saw what a Figure she made, it added to the former Surprize, and he entertain'd her in the most respectful Manner possible; congratulated her Advancement in Fortune, and particularly rejoic'd that it should fall to the poor Child's Lot to be so pro∣vided for, contrary to all Expectation.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> talk'd big, but very free and familiar; told them she had no Pride in her good Fortune; (that was true enough, for to give <HI>Amy</HI> her due, she was far from it, and was as good humour'd a Creature as ever liv'd) that she was the same as ever, and that she al∣ways lov'd this Boy, and was resolv'd to do something extraordinary for him.</P>
<P>Then she pull'd out her Money, and paid him down an hundred and twenty Pounds, which, she said, she gave him, that he might be sure he should be no Loser by taking him Home again, and that she would come and see him again, and talk farther about Things with him, that so all might be settled for him, in such a Manner, as the Accidents, such as Mortality, or any Thing else, should make no Alteration to the Child's Prejudice.</P>
<P>At this Meeting, the Uncle brought his Wife out, a good motherly, comely, grave Woman, who spoke very tenderly of the Youth, and as it appear'd, had been very good to him, tho' she had several Children of her own: After a long Discourse, she put in a Word of her own, Madam, says she, I am heartily glad of the good Intentions you have for this poor Orphan, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sincerely in it for his sake; but Madam, you know, (I suppose) that there are two Sisters alive too, may we not speak a Word for them? <HI>poor Girls, say she,</HI> they have not been so kindly us'd, as he has, and are turn'd out to the wide World.</P>
<P>Where are they, Madam? <HI>says Amy,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="203"/>
Poor Creatures, <HI>says the Gentlewoman,</HI> they are out at Service; no Body knows where but themselves; their Case is very hard.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> tho', if I cou'd but find them, I wou'd assist them; yet my Concern is for my Boy, as I call him, and I will put him in a Condition to take care of his Sisters.</P>
<P>But, Madam, says the good compassionate Creature, he may not be so charitable perhaps, by his own Incli∣nation, for Brothers are not Fathers; and they have been cruelly us'd already, poor Girls; we have often reliev'd them, both with Victuals and Cloaths too, even while they were pretended to be kept by their barbarous Aunt.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, says <HI>Amy,</HI> what can I do for them; they are gone, it seems, and cannot be heard of? When I see them, 'tis Time enough.</P>
<P>She press'd <HI>Amy</HI> then, to oblige their Brother, out of the plentiful Fortune he was like to have to do something for his Sisters, when he should be able.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> spoke coldly of that still, but said, she would consider of it; and so they parted for that Time; they had several Meetings after this, for <HI>Amy</HI> went to see her adopted Son, and order'd his Schooling, Cloaths, and other Things, but enjoin'd them not to tell the young Man any Thing, but that they thought the Trade he was at, too hard for him, and they wou'd keep him at Home a little longer, and give him some Schooling, to fit him for better Business; and <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd to him as she did before, only as one that had known his Mo∣ther, and had some Kindness for him.</P>
<P>Thus this Matter pass'd on for near a Twelve-month, when it happen'd, that one of my Maid Servants hav∣ing ask'd <HI>Amy</HI> Leave, for <HI>Amy</HI> was Mistress of the Ser∣vants, and took and put out such as she pleas'd; I say, having ask'd Leave to go into the City, to see some Friends, came Home crying bitterly, and in a most grievous Agony she was, and continued so several Days, till <HI>Amy</HI> perceiving the Excess, and that the
<PB N="206" REF="204"/>
Maid wou'd certainly cry herself sick; she took an Opportunity with her, and examin'd her about it.</P>
<P>The Maid told her a long Story, that she had been to see her Brother, the only Brother she had in the World; and that she knew he was put out Apprentice to a—; but there had come a Lady in a Coach to his Uncle—, who had brought him up, and made him take him Home again; and so the Wench run on with the whole Story, just as 'tis told above, till she came to that Part that belonged to herself; and there, says she, I had not let them know where I liv'd, and the Lady wou'd have taken me, and they say, wou'd have provided for me too, as she had done for my Bro∣ther, but no Body cou'd tell where to find me, and so I have lost it all, and all the Hopes of being any thing but a poor Servant all my Days; and then the Girl fell a crying.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> said, what's all this Story? who cou'd this La∣dy be? it must be some Trick sure: No, she said, 'twas not a Trick, for she had made them take her Bro∣ther Home from Apprentice, and bought him new Cloaths, and put him to have more Learning; and the Gentlewoman said she wou'd make him her Heir.</P>
<P>Her Heir! says <HI>Amy;</HI> what does that amount to; it may be she had nothing to leave him; she might make any body her Heir.</P>
<P>No, no, says the Girl, she came in a fine Coach and Horses, and I don't know how many Footmen to at∣tend her, and brought a great Bag of Gold, and gave it to my Uncle—, he that brought up my Brother, to buy him Cloaths, and to pay for his Schooling and Board.</P>
<P>He that brought up your Brother? says <HI>Amy;</HI> why, did not he bring you up too, as well as your Brother? Pray who brought you up then?</P>
<P>Here the poor Girl told a melancholy Story, how an Aunt had brought up her and her Sister, and how barbarously she had us'd them, as we have heard.</P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Amy</HI> had her Head full enough, and her Heart too; and did not know how to hold it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what to do, for she was satisfied that this was no other
<PB N="207" REF="205"/>
than my own Daughter; for she told her all the Histo∣ry of her Father and Mother; and how she was carried by their Maid to her Aunt's Door, just as is related in the beginning of my Story.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did not tell me this Story for a great while, nor did she well know what Course to take in it; but as she had Authority to manage every Thing in the Fa∣mily, she took Occasion some Time after, without letting me know any Thing of it, to find some Fault with the Maid, and turn her away.</P>
<P>Her Reasons were good, tho' at first I was not pleas'd when I heard of it, but I was convinc'd afterwards, that she was in the right; for if she had told me of it, I shou'd have been in great Perplexity between the Dif∣ficulty of concealing myself from my own Child, and the Inconvenience of having my Way of Living be known among my first Husband's Relations, and even to my Husband himself; for as to his being dead at <HI>Paris, Amy</HI> seeing me resolv'd against marrying any more, had told me, that she had form'd that Story only to make me easy, when I was in <HI>Holland,</HI> if any thing should offer to my liking.</P>
<P>However, I was too tender a Mother still, notwith∣standing what I had done, to let this poor Girl go about the World drudging, as it were for Bread, and slaving at the Fire, and in the Kitchin, as a Cook Maid; besides it came into my Head, that she might, perhaps, marry some poor Devil of a Footman, or a Coachman, or some such Thing, and be undone that Way, or, which was worse, be drawn in to lie with some of that course cursed Kind, and be with Child, and be utterly ruin'd that Way; and in the midst of all my Prosperity this gave me great Uneasiness.</P>
<P>As to sending <HI>Amy</HI> to her, there was no doing that now; for as she had been Servant in the House, she knew <HI>Amy,</HI> as well as <HI>Amy</HI> knew me; and no doubt, tho' I was much out of her Sight, yet she might have had the Curiosity to have peep'd at me, and seen me enough to know me again, if I had discover'd myself to her;
<PB N="208" REF="206"/>
so that, in short, there was nothing to be done that Way.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Amy,</HI> a diligent indefatigable Creature, found out another Woman, and gave her her Errand, and sent her to the honest Man's House in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> whither she suppos'd the Girl wou'd go, after she was out of her Place; and bade her talk with her, and tell her at a Distance, that as something had been done for her Bro∣ther, so something wou'd be done for her too; and that she shou'd not be discouraged, she carried her <HI>20l.</HI> to buy her Cloaths, and bid her not go to Service any more, but think of other Things; that she shou'd take a Lodg∣ing in some good Family, and that she shou'd soon hear further.</P>
<P>The Girl was overjoy'd with this News, you may be sure, and at first a little too much elevated with it, and dress'd herself very handsomely indeed, and as soon as she had done so, came and paid a Visit to Madam <HI>Amy,</HI> to let her see how fine she was: <HI>Amy</HI> congratu∣lated her, and wish'd it might be all as she expected; but admonish'd her not to be elevated with it too much; told her, Humility was the best Ornament of a Gen∣tlewoman; and a great deal of good Advice she gave her, but discover'd nothing.</P>
<P>All this was acted in the first Years of my setting up my new Figure here in Town, and while the Masks and Balls were in Agitation; and <HI>Amy</HI> carried the Affair of setting out my Son into the World, which we were as∣sisted in by the sage Advice of my faithful Counsellor Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> who procur'd us a Master for him, by whom he was afterwards sent Abroad to <HI>Italy,</HI> as you shall hear in its Place; and <HI>Amy</HI> managed my Daughter too very well, tho' by a third hand.</P>
<P>My Amour with my Lord—began now to draw to an end, and indeed notwithstanding his Money, it had lasted so long, that I was much more sick of his Lordship, than he cou'd be of me; he grew old, and fretful, and captious, and I must add, which made the Vice itself begin to grow surfeiting and nauceous to me, he grew worse and wickeder the older he grew, and
<PB N="209" REF="207"/>
that to such Degree, as is not fit to write of, and made me so weary of him, that upon one of his capricious Humours, which he often took Occasion to trouble me with, I took Occasion to be much less complaisant to him than I us'd to be; and as I knew him to be hasty, I first took Care to put him into a little Passion, and then to resent it, and this brought us to Words, in which I told him, I thought he grew sick of me; and he answer'd, in a heat, that truly so he was. I answer'd, that I found his Lordship was endeavouring to make me sick too; that I had met with several such Rubs from him of late; and that he did not use me as he was won't to do; and I begg'd his Lordship, he wou'd make himself easy: This I spoke with an Air of Coldness and Indifference, such as I knew he could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him, and tell him I was sick of him too, and desire him to quit me, for I knew that wou'd come of itself; besides, I had receiv'd a great deal of handsome Usage from him, and I was loth to have the Breach be on my Side, that he might not be able to say I was ungrateful.</P>
<P>But he put the Occasion into my Hands, for he came no more to me for two Months; indeed I expected a Fit of Absence, for such I had had several Times be∣fore, but not for above a Fortnight or three Weeks at most: But after I had staid a Month, which was lon∣ger than ever he kept away yet, I took a new Method with him, for I was resolv'd now it shou'd be in my Power to continue, or not, as I thought fit. At the End of a Month therefore, I remov'd, and took Lodg∣ings at <HI>Kensington Gravil Pits,</HI> and that Part next to the Road to <HI>Acton,</HI> and left no Body in my Lodgings but <HI>Amy</HI> and the Footman, with proper Instructions how to behave, when his Lordship being come to himself, shou'd think fit to come again, which I knew he wou'd.</P>
<P>About the End of two Months, he came in the Dusk of the Evening, as usual; the Footman answer'd him, and told him, his Lady was not at home, but there was Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> above; so he did not order her to be call'd down, but went up Stairs into the Dining Room,
<PB N="210" REF="208"/>
and Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> came to him; he ask'd where I was? My Lord, said she, my Mistress has been remov'd a a good while from hence, and lives at <HI>Kensington:</HI> Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy!</HI> how come you to be here then! My Lord, said she, we are here till the Quarter-Day, be∣cause the Goods are not remov'd, and to give Answer, if any comes to ask for my Lady: Well, and what Answer are you to give to me? Indeed, my Lord, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I have no particular Answer to your Lord∣ship, but to tell you, and every body else, where my Lady lives, that they may not think she's run away, No, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> says he, I don't think she's run away, but indeed, I can't go after her so far as that. <HI>Amy</HI> said nothing to that, but made a Curt'sy, and said, she be∣liev'd I wou'd be there again for a Week or two, in a little Time: How little time, Mrs. <HI>Amy? says my Lord:</HI> She comes next <HI>Tuesday,</HI> says <HI>Amy:</HI> Very well, <HI>says my Lord,</HI> I will call and see her then; and so he went away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and staid a Fort∣night, but he came not; so I went back to <HI>Kensington,</HI> and after that, I had very few of his Lordship's Visits, which I was very glad of, and in a little Time after was more glad of it, than I was at first, and upon a far better Account too.</P>
<P>For now I began not to be sick of his Lordship only, but really I began to be sick of the Vice; and as I had good Leisure now to divert and enjoy myself in the World, as much as it was possible for any Woman to do, that ever liv'd in it; so I found that my Judgment began to prevail upon me to fix my Delight upon nobler Objects than I had formerly done; and the very beginning of this brought some just Reflections upon me, relating to Things past, and to the former Manner of my living; and tho' there was not the least Hint in all this, from what may be call'd Religion or Conscience, and far from any Thing of Repentance, or any Thing that was a-kin to it, especially at first; yet the Sense of Things, and the Knowledge I had of the World, and the vast Variety of Scenes that I had acted my Part in,
<PB N="211" REF="209"/>
began to work upon my Senses, and it came so very strong upon my Mind one Morning, when I had been lying awake some Time in my Bed, as if somebody had ask'd me the Question, <HI>What was I a Whore for now?</HI> It occurr'd naturally upon this Enquiry, that at first I yielded to the Importunity of my Circumstances, the Misery of which, the Devil dismally aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confess I had strong natural Aversions to the Crime at first, partly owing to a virtu∣ous Education, and partly to a Sense of Religion; but the Devil, and that greater Devil of Poverty prevail'd; and the Person who laid Siege to me, did it in such an obliging, and I may almost say, irresistible Manner, all still manag'd by the evil Spirit, for I must be allowed to believe, that he has a Share in all such Things, if not the whole Management of them: But, I say, it was carried on by that Person, in such an irresistible Man∣ner, that (as I said) when I related the Fact, there was no withstanding it: These Circumstances, I say, the Devil manag'd, not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as Arguments to fortify my Mind a∣gainst all Reflection, and to keep me in that horrid Course I had engaged in, as if it were honest and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now; this was a Pretence and here was something to be said, tho' I acknowledge, it ought not to have been sufficient to me at all; but, I say, to leave that, all this was out of Doors; the De∣vil himself could not form one Argument, or put one Reason into my Head <HI>now,</HI> that could serve for an An∣swer, no, not so much as a pretended Answer to this Question, <HI>Why I should be a Whore now?</HI></P>
<P>It had for a while been a little kind of Excuse to me, that I was engaged with this wicked old Lord, and that I could not in Honour forsake him; but how foolish and absurd did it look to repeat the Word <HI>Honour</HI> on so vile an Occasion? as if a Woman should prostitute her Ho∣nour in Point of Honour; horrid Inconsistency! Honour call'd upon me to detest the Crime and the Man too, and to have resisted all the Attacks which from the Be∣ginning had been made upon my Virtue; and Honour,
<PB N="212" REF="210"/>
had it been consulted, would have preserved me honest from the Beginning.</P>
<P>For HONESTY and HONOUR are the same.</P>
<P>This, however, shews us with what faint Excuses, and with what Trifles we pretend to satisfy ourselves, and suppress the Attempts of Conscience in the Pursuit of a∣greeable Crime, and in the possessing those Pleasures which we are loth to part with.</P>
<P>But this Objection would now serve no longer; for my Lord had, in some Sort, broke his Engagements <HI>(I won't call it Honour again)</HI> with me, and had so far slighted me as fairly to justify my entire quitting of him now; and so, as the Objection was fully answered, the Questi∣on remained still unanswered, <HI>Why am I a Whore now?</HI> Nor indeed had I any Thing to say for myself, <HI>even to myself;</HI> I could not without blushing, as wicked as I was, answer, that I lov'd it for the Sake of the Vice, and that I delighted in being a Whore, <HI>as such;</HI> I say, I could not say this, even to myself, <HI>and all alone,</HI> nor in∣deed would it have been true. I was never able in Jus∣tice, and with Truth, to say I was so wicked as that; but as Necessity first debauched me, and Poverty made me a Whore at the Beginning; so Excess of Avance for getting Money, and Excess of Vanity, continued me in the Crime, not being able to resist the Flatteries of great Persons; being call'd the finest Woman in <HI>France;</HI> be∣ing caress'd by a Prince; and afterwards I had Pride e∣nough to expect, and Folly enough to believe, tho' in∣deed without Ground, by a great Monarch: These were my Baits, these the Chains by which the Devil held me bound; and by which I was indeed too fast held for any Reasoning that I was then Mistress of to deliver me from.</P>
<P>But this was all over now; Avarice could have no Pretence; I was out of the Reach of all that Fate could do to reduce me; now I was so far from Poor, or the Danger of it, that I had fifty thousand Pounds in my Pocket at least; nay, I had the Income of fifty thou∣sand Pounds; for I had 2500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year coming in upon
<PB N="213" REF="211"/>
very good Land-security, besides three or four thousand Pounds in Money, which I kept by me for ordinary Oc∣casions, and besides Jewels and Plate, and Goods, which were worth near 5600 <HI>l.</HI> more; these put together, when I ruminated on it all in my Thoughts, as you may be sure I did often, added Weight still to the Question, as above, and it sounded continually in my Head, what's next? <HI>What am I a Whore for now?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I say, seldom out of my Thoughts, but yet it made no Impressions upon me of that Kind which might be expected from a Reflection of so important a Nature, and which had so much of Sub∣stance and Seriousness in it.</P>
<P>But however, it was not without some little Conse∣quences, even at that Time, and which gave a little Turn to my Way of Living at first, as you shall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>But one particular Thing interven'd besides this, which gave me some Uneasiness at this Time, and made Way for other Things that followed. I have mentioned in several little Digressions, the Concern I had upon me for my Children, and in what Manner I had directed that Affair; I must go on a little with that Part, in order to bring the subsequent Parts of my Story together.</P>
<P>My Boy, the only Son I had left, that I had a legal Right to call Son, was, <HI>as I have said,</HI> rescued from the un∣happy Circumstances of being Apprentice to a Mechanic, and was brought up upon a new Foot; but tho' this was infinitely to his Advantage, yet it put him back near three Years in his coming into the World, for he had been near a Year at the Drudgery he was first put to, and it took up two Years more to form him for what he had Hopes given him he should hereafter be, so that he was full nineteen Years old, or rather twenty Years, be∣fore he came to be put out as I intended; at the End of which Time I put him to a very flourishing <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chant, and he again sent him to <HI>Messina,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and a little before the Juncture I am now speak∣ing of, I had Letters from him, that is to say, Mrs. <HI>A∣my</HI> had Letters from him, intimating that he was out of his Time, and that he had an Opportunity to be taken
<PB N="214" REF="212"/>
into an <HI>English</HI> House there, on very good Terms, if his Support from hence might answer what he was bid to hope for; and so begg'd that what would be done for him might be so ordered that he might have it for his present Advancement, referring for the Particulars to his Master, the Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> whom he had been put Apprentice to here; who, to cut the Story short, gave such a satisfactory Account of it, and of my young Man, to my steddy and faithful Counsellor Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that I made no Scruple to pay 4000 <HI>l.</HI> which was 1000 <HI>l.</HI> more than he demanded, or rather proposed, that he might have Encouragement to enter into the World bet∣ter than he expected.</P>
<P>His Master remitted the Money very faithfully to him, and finding by Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that the young Gen∣tleman, for so he call'd him, was well supported, wrote such Letters on his Account, as gave him a Credit a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Messina,</HI> equal in Value to the Money itself.</P>
<P>I could not digest it very well, that I should all this while conceal myself thus from my own Child, and make all this Favour due, in his Opinion, to a Stranger and yet I could not find in my Heart to let my Son know what a Mother he had, and what a Life she liv'd; when at the same Time that he must think himself infinitely obliged to me, he must be oblig'd, if he was a Man of Virtue, to hate his Mother, and abhor the Way of Liv¦ing, by which all the Bounty he enjoyed was raised.</P>
<P>This is the Reason of mentioning this Part of my Son'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Story, which is otherwise no Ways concerned in my Hi¦story, but as it put me upon thinking how to put an End to that wicked Course I was in, that my own Child, when he should afterwards come to <HI>England</HI> in a good Figure and with the Appearance of a Merchant, should not be asham'd to own me.</P>
<P>But there was another Difficulty, which lay heavie upon me a great deal, and that was, my Daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who, as before, I had relieved by the Hands of another Instrument, which <HI>Amy</HI> had procur'd: The Girl, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have mentioned, was directed to put herself into a good Garb, take Lodgings, and entertain a Maid to wait up¦on her, and to give herself some Breeding, that is to say
<PB N="215" REF="213"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o learn to dance, and fit herself to appear as a Gentle∣woman; being made to hope, that she should, sometime or other, find that she should be put into a Condition to support her Character, and to make herself amends for all her former Troubles; she was only charged not to be drawn into Matrimony, till she was secur'd of a For∣tune that might assist to dispose of herself suitable not to what she then was, but what she was to be.</P>
<P>The Girl was too sensible of her Circumstances, not to give all possible Satisfaction of that Kind, and indeed she was Mistress of too much Understanding, not to see how much she should be oblig'd to that Part for her own Interest.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, but being well equipped, and in every Thing well set out, as she was directed, he came, as I have related above, and paid a Visit to Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and to tell her of her good Fortune. <HI>Amy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etended to be much surpriz'd at the Alteration, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erjoy'd for her Sake, and began to treat her very well, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntertain'd her handsomely, and when she would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one away, pretended to ask my Leave, and sent my Coach Home with her; and in short, learning from her where she lodg'd, which was in the City, <HI>Amy</HI> promis'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o return her Visit, and did so; and in a Word, <HI>Amy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd SUSAN (for she was my own Name) began an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>timate Acquaintance together.</P>
<P>There was an inexpressible Difficulty in the poor Girl's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, or else I should not have been able to have for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> discovering myself to her, and this was, her hav∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g been a Servant in my particular Family; and I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no Means think of ever letting the Children know <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat a kind of Creature they ow'd their Being to, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving them an Occasion to upbraid their Mother with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r scandalous Life, much less to justify the like Practice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om my Example.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, consider∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g Parents always find it, that their own Children are Restraint to them in their worst Courses, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of a superior Power has not the same Influence: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="214"/>
There happened however, one good Circumstance the Case of this poor Girl, which brought about a Dis¦covery sooner than otherwise it would have been; and i was thus: After she and <HI>Amy</HI> had been intimate for some Time, and had exchang'd several Visits, the Girl now grown a Woman, talking to <HI>Amy</HI> of the gay Thing that us'd to fall out when she was Servant in my Family spoke of it with a kind of Concern, that she could no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see <HI>[me]</HI> her Lady; and at last she adds, <HI>'twas very strange, Madam,</HI> say she to <HI>Amy,</HI> but tho' I lived nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Years in the House, I never saw my Mistress in my Life, except it was that public Night when she danc'd in the fine <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit, and then she was so disguis'd that I knew nothing of her afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was glad to hear this; but as she was a cunning Girl from the Beginning, she was not to be bit, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she laid no Stress upon that at first, but gave me a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Account of it; and, I must confess, it gave me a se¦cret Joy, to think that I was not known to her; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, by Virtue of that only Accident, I might, who other Circumstances made Room for it, discover myse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to her, and let her know she had a Mother in a Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tion fit to be own'd.</P>
<P>It was a dreadful Restraint to me before, and this ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me some very sad Reflections, and made way for t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great Question I have mentioned above; and by he much the Circumstance was bitter to me, by so much the more agreeable it was, to understand that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had never seen me, and consequently, did not know <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> again, if she was to be told who I was.</P>
<P>However, the next Time she came to visit <HI>Amy,</HI> I w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> resolved to put it to a Tryal, and to come into the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and let her see me, and to see by that, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> knew me or no; but <HI>Amy</HI> put me by, lest indeed, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was Reason enough to question, I should not be able contain, or forbear discovering myself to her; so it w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> off for that Time.</P>
<P>But both these Circumstances, and that is the Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of my mentioning them, brought me to consider of Life I liv'd, and to resolve to put myself into some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦gure of Life, in which I might not be scandalous to
<PB N="217" REF="215"/>
own Family, and be afraid to make myself known to my own Children, who were my own Flesh and Blood.</P>
<P>There was another Daughter I had, which, with all our Enquiries we could not hear of, high nor low, for several Years after the first. But I return to my own Story.</P>
<P>Being now in Part remov'd from my old Station, I seem'd to be in a fair Way of retiring from my old Ac∣quaintances, and consequently from the vile abomi∣nable Trade I had driven so long; so that the Door seem'd to be, as it were, particularly opened to my Re∣formation, if I had any Mind to it in earnest; but for all that, some of my old Friends, as I us'd to call them, enquir'd me out, and came to visit me at <HI>Kensington,</HI> and that more frequently than I wish'd they would do; but it being once known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unless I would have downright refused and affronted them; and I was not yet in earnest enough with my Resolutions to go that Length.</P>
<P>The best of it was, my old lewd Favourite, whom I now heartily hated, entirely dropt me; he came once to visit me, but I caused <HI>Amy</HI> to deny me, and say I was gone out; she did it so oddly too, that when his Lord∣ship went away, he said coldly to her, Well, well, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> I find your Mistress does not desire to be seen; tell her I won't trouble her <HI>any more,</HI> repeating the Words <HI>any more</HI> two or three Times over, just at his going away.</P>
<P>I reflected a little on it at first, as unkind to him, hav∣ing had so many considerable Presents from him, but, <HI>as I have said,</HI> I was sick of him, and that on some Accounts, which if I cou'd suffer myself to publish them, wou'd fully justify my Conduct; but that Part of the Story will not bear telling; so I must leave it, and proceed.</P>
<P>I had begun a little, <HI>as I have said above,</HI> to reflect upon my Manner of Living, and to think of putting a new Face upon it; and nothing mov'd me to it more than the Consideration of my having three Children, who were now grown up; and yet, that while I was in that Station of Life, I could not converse with them, or
<PB N="218" REF="216"/>
make myself known to them; and this gave me a great deal of Uneasiness; at last I enter'd into Talk on this Part of it with my Woman <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>We liv'd at <HI>Kensington, as I have said,</HI> and though I had done with my old wicked L—, as above, yet I was frequently visited, <HI>as I said,</HI> by some others, so that, in a Word, I began to be known in the Town, not by my Name only, but my Character too, which was worse.</P>
<P>It was one Morning when <HI>Amy</HI> was in Bed with me, and I had some of my dullest Thoughts about me, that <HI>Amy</HI> hearing me sigh pretty often, ask'd me if I was not well? Yes, <HI>Amy,</HI> I am well enough, <HI>says I,</HI> but my Mind is oppress'd with heavy Thoughts, and has been so a good while; and then I told her how it griev'd me that I could not make myself known to my own Children, or form any Acquaintances in the World: Why so? <HI>says</HI> Amy; Why prithee, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> what will my Children say to themselves, and to one another, when they find their Mother, however rich she may be, is at best but a Whore, a common Whore? And as for Acquaintance, prithee <HI>Amy,</HI> what sober Lady, or what Family of any Character will visit or be acquainted with a Whore?</P>
<P>Why, all that's true, Madam, <HI>says</HI> Amy; but how can it be remedy'd now? 'Tis true, <HI>Amy, said I,</HI> the Thing cannot be remedy'd now, but the Scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.</P>
<P>Truly, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't see how, unless you will go abroad again, and live in some other Nation, where no Body has known us, or seen us, so that they cannot say they ever saw us before.</P>
<P>That very Thought of <HI>Amy</HI> put what follows into my Head; and I returned, Why <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> is it not possible for me to shift my Being, from this Part of the Town, and go and live in another Part of the City, or another Part of the Country, and be as entirely con∣ceal'd as if I had never been known?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I believe it might; but then you must put off all your Equipages, and Servants, Coaches
<PB N="219" REF="217"/>
and Horses; change your Liveries, nay, your own Cloaths, and if it was possible your very Face.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I,</HI> and that's the Way, <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I'll do, and that forthwith; for I am not able to live in this Manner any longer: <HI>Amy</HI> came into this with a kind of Pleasure particular to herself, that is to say, with an Eagerness not to be resisted; for <HI>Amy</HI> was apt to be precipitant in her Motions, and was for doing it imme∣diately: Well, <HI>says I, Amy,</HI> as soon as you will, but what Course must we take to do it? we cannot put off Servants and Coach and Horses, and every Thing, leave off House-keeping, and transform ourselves into a new Shape, all in a Moment; Servants must have Warn∣ing, and the Goods must be sold off, and a thousand Things, and this began to perplex us, and in particular, took us up two or three Days Consideration.</P>
<P>At last, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was a clever Manager in such Cases, came to me with a Scheme, as she call'd it; I have found it out, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> I have found a Scheme how you shall, if you have a Mind to it, begin and fi∣nish a perfect entire Change of your Figure and Circum∣stances, in one Day; and shall be as much unknown, Madam, in twenty four Hours, as you would be in so many Years.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> let us hear it, for you please me mightily with the Thoughts of it. Why then, <HI>says</HI> A∣my, let me go into the City this Afternoon, and I'll en∣quire out some honest, plain, sober Family, where I will take Lodgings for you, as for a Country-Gentle∣woman that desires to be in <HI>London</HI> for about half a Year, and to board yourself and a Kinswoman, that is half a Servant, half a Companion, meaning myself; and so agree with them by the Month.</P>
<P>To this Lodging (if I hit upon one to your Mind) you may go to Morrow Morning in a Hackney-Coach, with no Body but me, and leave such Cloaths and Lin∣nen as you think fit; but to be sure, the plainest you have, and then you are remov'd at once, you need ne∣ver so much as set your Foot in this House again, (mean∣ing where we then were) or see any Body belonging to it; in the mean Time I'll let the Servants know, that
<PB N="220" REF="218"/>
you are going over to <HI>Holland</HI> upon extraordinary Busi¦ness, and will leave off your Equipages, and so I'll give them Warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a Month's Wages; then I will sell off your Furniture as well as I can; as to your Coach, it is but having it new painted, and the Lining chang'd, and getting new Harness and Hammer-cloths, and you may keep it still, or dispose of it as you think fit; and only take Care to let this Lodging be in some remote Part of the Town, and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you had never been in <HI>England</HI> in your Life.</P>
<P>This was <HI>Amy</HI>'s Scheme; and it pleas'd me so well, that I resolved not only to let her go, but was resolved to go with her myself; but <HI>Amy</HI> put me off of that, be∣cause, <HI>she said,</HI> she should have Occasion to hurry up and down so long, that if I was with her, it would ra∣ther hinder than farther her; so I wav'd it.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>Amy</HI> went, and was gone five long Hours; but when she came back, I could see by her Counte∣nance, that her Success had been suitable to her Pains; for she came laughing and gaping, O Madam! <HI>says she,</HI> I have pleased you to the Life; and with that, she tells me how she had fix'd upon a House in a Court in the <HI>Minories;</HI> that she was directed to it meerly by Accident; that it was a Female Family, the Master of the House being gone to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that the Woman had four Children, kept two Maids, and liv'd very hand∣somely, but wanted Company to divert her; and that on that very Account, she had agreed to take Boarders.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> agreed for a good handsome Price, because she was resolved I should be us'd well; so she bargain'd to give her 35 <HI>l.</HI> for the half Year, and 50 <HI>l.</HI> if we took a Maid, leaving that to my Choice; and that we might be satisfy'd we should meet with nothing very gay, the People were QUAKERS, and I lik'd them the better.</P>
<P>I was so pleased that I resolved to go with <HI>Amy</HI> the next Day to see the Lodgings, and to see the Woman of the House, and see how I lik'd them; but if I was pleas'd with the General, I was much more pleas'd with the Par∣ticulars; for the Gentlewoman, I must call her so, tho' she was a QUAKER, was a most courteous, obliging,
<PB N="221" REF="219"/>
mannerly Person; perfectly well-bred, and perfectly well-humour'd, and in short, the most agreeable Con∣versation that ever I met with; and which was worth all, so grave, and yet so pleasant and so merry, that 'tis scarce possible for me to express how I was pleased and delighted with her Company; and particularly, I was so pleased that I would go away no more; so I e'en took up my Lodging there the very first Night.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, tho' it took up <HI>Amy</HI> almost a Month so entirely, to put off all the Appearances of House-keeping, as above, it need take me up no Time to relate it; 'tis enough to say, that <HI>Amy</HI> quitted all that Part of the World, and came Pack and Package to me, and here we took up our Abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect Retreat indeed; remote from the Eyes of all that ever had seen me, and as much out of the Way of being ever seen or heard of by any of the Gang that us'd to follow me, as if I had been among the Mountains in <HI>Lancashire;</HI> for when did a blue Gar∣ter, or a Coach-and-six come into a little narrow Passage in the <HI>Minories</HI> or <HI>Goodman's-Fields?</HI> And as there was no Fear of them, so really I had no Desire to see them, or so much as to hear from them any more as long as I lived.</P>
<P>I seem'd in a little Hurry while <HI>Amy</HI> came and went so every Day at first; but when that was over I lived here perfectly retired, and with a most pleasant and a∣greeable Lady; I must call her so, for tho' a QUAKER, she had a full Share of good Breeding sufficient to her, if she had been a Dutchess; in a Word, she was the most agreeable Creature in her Conversation, <HI>as I said before,</HI> that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there some Time, to be extremely in Love with the Dress of the QUAKERS, and this pleased her so much, that she would needs dress me up one Day in a Suit of her own Cloaths; but my real Design was, to see whether it would pass upon me for a Disguise.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was struck with the Novelty, tho' I had not mentioned my Design to her, and when the QUAKER was gone out of the Room, <HI>says</HI> Amy, I guess your
<PB N="222" REF="220"/>
Meaning; it is a perfect Disguise to you; why you look quite another Body, I should not have known you my∣self; nay, <HI>says</HI> Amy, more than that, it makes you look ten Years younger than you did.</P>
<P>Nothing could please me better than that; and when <HI>Amy</HI> repeated it, I was so fond of it, that I ask'd my QUAKER, (I won't call her Landlady, 'tis indeed too coarse a Word for her, and she deserv'd a much better; I say, I ask'd her if she would sell it; I told her I was so fond of it, that I would give her enough to bay he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a better Suit; she declined it at first, but I soon perceiv'd that it was chiefly in good Manners, because I should not dishonour myself, as she call'd it, to put on her old Cloaths; but if I pleas'd to accept of them, she would give me them for my Dressing-cloaths, and go with me, and buy a Suit for me, that might be better worth my wearing.</P>
<P>But as I conversed in a very frank open Manner with her, I bid her do the like with me; that I made no Scru∣ples of such Things; but that if she would let me have them, I would satisfy her; so she let me know what they cost, and to make her Amends, I gave her three Guineas more than they cost her.</P>
<P>This good (tho' unhappy) QUAKER had the Misfor∣tune to have had a bad Husband, and he was gone be∣yond Sea; she had a good House and well furnished, and had some Jointure of her own Estate, which supported her and her Children, so that she did not want; but she was not at all above such a Help, as my being there was to her; so she was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no Way to fix this new Acquaintance, like making myself a Friend to her, I began with making her some handsome Presents, and the like, to her Children. And first, opening my Bundies one Day in my Chamber, I heard her in another Room, and call'd her in with a kind of familiar Way; there I shew'd her some of my fine Cloaths, and having among the rest of my Things a Piece of very fine new Holland, which I had bought a little before, worth about <HI>9s.</HI> an Ell, I pull'd it out, <HI>Here, my Friend,</HI> says I, <HI>I will make you</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="221"/>
<HI>a Present, if you will accept of it;</HI> and with that I laid the Piece of Holland in her Lap.</P>
<P>I could see she was surprized, and that she could hard∣ly speak; <HI>What dost thou mean?</HI> says she, <HI>indeed I can∣not have the Face to accept so fine a Present as this;</HI> ad∣ding, <HI>'Tis fit for thy own Use, but 'tis above my Wear indeed.</HI> I thought she had meant she must not wear it so fine, because she was a QUAKER; so I return'd, Why, do not you Quakers wear fine Linnen neither? Yes, <HI>says she,</HI> we wear fine Linnen when we can afford it, but this is too good for me. However, I made her take it, and she was very thankful too; but my End was answered another Way, for by this I engaged her so, that as I found her a Woman of Understanding, and of Honesty too, I might, upon any Occasion, have a Confidence in her, which was indeed, what I very much wanted.</P>
<P>By accustoming myself to converse with her, I had not only learn'd to dress like a QUAKER, but so us'd myself to THEE and THOU, that I talk'd like a QUAKER too, as ready and naturally as if I had been born among them; and, in a Word, I pass'd for a QUAKER among all People that did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been so us'd to a Coach, that I knew not how well to go without one; besides, I thought it would be a farther Disguise to me, so I told my Quaker-Friend one Day, that I thought I lived too close, that I wanted A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; she propos'd taking a Hackney-Coach sometimes, or a Boat; but I told her I had always had a Coach of my own till now, and I could find in my Heart to have one again.</P>
<P>She seem'd to think it strange at first, considering how close I liv'd, but had not nothing to say when she found I did not value the Expence; so in short, I resolved I would have a Coach. When we came to talk of Equipages, she extoll'd the having all Things plain, I said so too; so I left it to her Direction, and a Coach Maker was sent for, and he provided me a plain Coach, no gilding or painting, lin'd with a light grey Cloath, and my Coachman had a Coat of the same, and no Lace on his Hat.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="222"/>
When all was ready, I dress'd myself in the Dress I bought of her, <HI>and said,</HI> Come, I'll be a QUAKER to Day, and you and I'll go abroad, which we did; and there was not a QUAKER in the Town that look'd less like a Counterfeit than I did. But all this was my par∣ticular Plot to be the more compleatly concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known, and yet need not be confin'd like a Prisoner, and be always in Fear: so that all the rest was Grimace.</P>
<P>We lived there very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my Mind; I was like a Fish out of Wa∣ter; I was as gay, and as young in my Disposition, as I was at five and twenty; and as I had always been courted, flatter'd, and us'd to love it, so I miss'd it in my Conversation; and this put me many Times upon lock∣ing back upon Things past.</P>
<P>I had very few Moments in my Life, which in their Reflection, afforded me any Thing but Regret; but of all the foolish Actions I had to look back upon in my Life, none look'd so preposterous, and so like Distracti∣on, nor left so much Melancholy on my Mind, as my parting with my Friend, the <HI>Merchant of Paris,</HI> and the refusing him upon such honourable and just Corditi∣ons as he had offered; and tho' on his just (which I cal∣led unkind) rejecting my Invitation to come to him a∣gain, I had look'd on him with some Disgust, yet now my Mind run upon him continually, and the ridiculous Conduct of my refusing him, and I could never be satis∣fy'd about him; I flatter'd myself, that if I could see him, I could yet master him, and that he would pre∣sently forget all that had pass'd, that might be thought unkind; but as there was no Room to imagine any Thing like that to be possible, I threw those Thoughts off again as much as I could.</P>
<P>However, they continually return'd, and I had no Rest Night or Day, for thinking of him, whom I had forgot above eleven Years. I told <HI>Amy</HI> of it, and we talk'd it over sometimes in Bed, almost whole Nights together. At last <HI>Amy</HI> started a Thing of her own Head, which put it in a Way of Management, tho' a wild one too. <HI>You are so uneasy, Madam,</HI> says she, <HI>about</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="223"/>
<HI>this Mr.—the Merchant at</HI> Paris; <HI>Come, says she, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou'll give me Leave, I'll go over, and see what's become of him.</HI></P>
<P>Not for ten thousand Pounds, said I; no, nor if you met him in the Street, not to offer to speak to him on my Account: No, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I wou'd not speak to him at all, or if I did, I warrant you it shall not look to be upon your Account; I'll only enquire after him, and if he is in Being, you shall hear of him, if not, you shall hear of him still, and that may be enough.</P>
<P>Why, says I, if you will promise me not to enter into any Thing relating to me, with him, nor to be∣gin any Discourse at all, unless he begins it with you, I cou'd almost be perswaded to let you go and try.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me all that I desir'd; and, in a Word, to cut the Story short, I let her go; but ty'd her up to so many Particulars, that it was almost impossible her going cou'd signify any Thing; and had she intended to observe them, she might as well have staid at home <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t have gone; for I charg'd her, if she came to see him, she shou'd not so much as take Notice that she knew him again; and if he spoke to her, she should tell him, the was come away from me a great many Years ago, and knew nothing what was become of me; that she had been come over to <HI>France</HI> six Years ago, and was marry'd there, and liv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> or to that Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me nothing indeed, for, as she said, it was impossible for her to resolve what wou'd be fit to do, or not to do, till she was there upon the Spot, and had found out the Gentleman, or heard of him; but that then, if I wou'd trust her, as I had always done, she wou'd answer for it, that she wou'd do nothing but what shou'd be for my Interest, and what she wou'd hope I shou'd be very well pleas'd with.</P>
<P>With this general Commission, <HI>Amy,</HI> notwithstand∣ing she had been so frighted at the Sea, ventur'd her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reass once more by Water, and away she goes to <HI>France;</HI> she had sour Articles of Confidence in Charge to enquire after, for me, and as I found by her, she had one for herself; I say, sour for me, because tho'
<PB N="226" REF="224"/>
her first and principal Errand was, to inform herself of my <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; yet I gave her in Charge to en∣quire, 2. After my Husband, whom I left a Trooper in the <HI>Gensd'arms.</HI> 3 After that Rogue of a <HI>Jew,</HI> whose very Name I hated, and of whose Face I had such a frightful Idea, that <HI>Satan</HI> himself cou'd not coun∣terseit a worse: And <HI>Lastly,</HI> After my Foreign Prince: And she discharg'd herself very well of them all, tho' not so successful as I wish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had a very good Passage over the Sea, and I had a Letter from her, from <HI>Calais,</HI> in three Days af∣ter she went from <HI>London:</HI> When she came to <HI>Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> she wrote me an Account, that as to her first and most important Enquiry, which was after the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer∣chant; her Account was. That he had return'd to <HI>Pa∣ris;</HI> liv'd three Years there, and quitting that City, went to live at <HI>Roan:</HI> So away goes <HI>Amy</HI> for <HI>Roan</HI></P>
<P>But as she was going to be speak a Place in the Coach to <HI>Roan,</HI> she meets very accidentally in the Street, with her Gentleman, as I call'd him; that is to say, the Prince <HI>de—'s</HI> Gentleman, who had been her Fa∣vourite, <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>You may be sure there were several other kind Things happen'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and him, as you shall hear afterwards: But the two main Things were, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. That <HI>Amy</HI> enquir'd about his Lord, and had a full Ac∣count of him, of which presently; and in the next Place, telling him whither she was going, and for what; he bade her not go yet, for that he wou'd have a particular Account of it the next Day, from a Mer∣chant that knew him; and accordingly he brought her Word the next Day, that he had been for six Years before that, gone for <HI>Holland,</HI> and that he liv'd there still.</P>
<P>This, I say, was the first News from <HI>Amy</HI> for some Time, I mean, about my Merchant: In the mean Time <HI>Amy,</HI> as I have said, enquir'd about the other Person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she had in her Instructions: As for the Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentleman told her, he was gone into <HI>Germany,</HI> where his Estate lay, and that he liv'd there; that he had made
<PB N="227" REF="225"/>
great Enquiry after me; that he (his Gentleman) had made all the Search he had been able, for me; but that he cou'd not hear of me; that he believ'd if his Lord had known I had been in <HI>England,</HI> he wou'd have gone over to me; but that, after long Enquiry, he was oblig'd to give it over; but that he verily be∣liev'd, if he cou'd have found me, he wou'd have mar∣ried me; and that he was extremely concern'd that he cou'd hear nothing of me.</P>
<P>I was not at all satisfy'd with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Account, but order'd her to go to <HI>Roan</HI> herself; which she did, and there with much Difficulty, (the Person she was directed to being dead) I say, with much Difficulty, she came to be inform'd, that my Merchant had liv'd there two Years, or something more; but that having met with a very great Misfortune, he had gone back to <HI>Holland,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> Merchant said, where he staid two Years; but with this Addition, <HI>viz.</HI> that he came back again to <HI>Roan,</HI> and liv'd in good Reputation there another Year; and afterwards, he was gone to <HI>England;</HI> and that he liv'd in <HI>London:</HI> But <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd by no Means learn how to write to him there, till by great Accident, an old <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, who had formerly serv'd him, coming to <HI>Roan, Amy</HI> was told of it; and he told her, that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Laurence Pountn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y's Lane,</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI> but was to be seen every Day upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Walk.</P>
<P>This <HI>Amy</HI> thought it was Time enough to tell me of, when she came over; and besides she did not find this <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, till she had spent four or five Months, and been again at <HI>Paris,</HI> and then come back to <HI>Roan</HI> for farther Information: But in the mean Time she wrote me from <HI>Paris,</HI> that he was not to be found by any Means; that he had been gone from <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> seven or eight Years; that she was told he had liv'd at <HI>Roan,</HI> and she was a going thither to enquire, but that she had heard afterward, that he was gone also from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> so she did not go.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="226"/>
This, I say, was <HI>Amy</HI>'s first Account; and I not sa∣tisfy'd with it, had sent her an Order to go to <HI>Roan,</HI> to enquire there also, as above.</P>
<P>While this was negociating, and I receiv'd these Ac∣counts from <HI>Amy</HI> at several Times, a strange Adventure happen'd to me, which I must mention just here; I had been Abroad to take the Air, as usual, with my QUAK∣ER, as far as <HI>Epping Forrest,</HI> and we were driving back towards <HI>London;</HI> when on the Road between <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Mile-End,</HI> two Gentlemen on Horseback came riding by, having overtaken the Coach, and pass'd it, and went forwards towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>They did not ride apace, tho' they pass'd the Coach, for we went very softly, nor did they look into the Coach at all, but rode side by side, earnestly talking to one another, and inclining their Faces side-ways a lit∣tle towards one another, he that went nearest the Coach, with his Face from it, and he that was farthest from the Coach, with his Face towards it, and passing in the very next Tract to the Coach, I cou'd hear them talk <HI>Dutch</HI> very distinctly; but it is impossible to describe the Confusion I was in, when I plainly saw that the farthest of the two, him whose Face look'd towards the Coach, was my Friend, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>If it had been possible to conceal my Disorder from my Friend, the QUAKER, I would have done it, but I found she was too well acquainted with such Things, not to take the Hint; dost thou understand <HI>Dutch? said she; Why? said I; Why, says she,</HI> 'tis easy to suppose that thou art a little concern'd at somewhat those Men say; I suppose they are talking of thee. Indeed my good Friend, said I, thou art mistaken this Time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but 'ts all about Ships and Trading Affairs: Well, says she, then one of them is a Man Friend of thine, or some∣what is the Case; for tho' thy Tongue will not confess it, thy Face does.</P>
<P>I was going to have told a bold Lye, and said, I knew nothing of them, but I found it was impossible to conceal it, so I said, indeed, I think I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the

farthest of them; but I have neither spoken to him, or so much as seen him for above 11 Years: Well then, says she, Thou hast seen him with more than common Eyes, when thou did'st see him; or else seeing him now would not be such a Surprize to thee: Indeed, said I, 'tis true I am a little surpriz'd at seeing him just now, for I thought he had been in quite another Part of the World; and I can assure you, I never saw him in <HI>England</HI> in my Life: Well then, 'tis the more likely he is come over now on purpose to seek thee: No, no, said I, Knight Errantry is over, Women are not so hard to come at, that Men should not be able to please themselves without running from one Kingdom to an∣other: Well, well, says she, I would have him see thee for all that, as plainly as thou hast seen him; No, but he shan't, says I, for I am sure he don't know me in this Dress, and I'll take Care he shan't see my Face, if I can help it; so I held up my Fan before my Face, and she saw me resolute in that, so she press'd me no farther.</P>
<P>We had several Discourses upon the Subject, but still I let her know I was resolv'd he should not know me; but, at last, I confess'd so much, that tho' I would not let him know who I was, or where I liv'd, I did not care if I knew where he liv'd, and how I might enquire about him: She took the Hint imme∣diately, and her Servant being behind the Coach, she call'd him to the Coach-side, and bade him keep his Eye upon that Gentleman, and as soon as the Coach came to the End of <HI>White Chapple,</HI> he should get down, and follow him closely, so as to see where he put up his Horse, and then to go into the Inn, and enquire, if he could, who he was, and where he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Fellow follow'd diligently to the Gate of an Inn in <HI>Bishopgate Street,</HI> and seeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fast, but was confounded, when upon Enquiry he found the Inn was a Thorow∣fare into another Street, and that the two Gentlemen had only rode thorow the Inn, as the Way to the Street
<PB N="230" REF="228"/>
where they were going, and so, in short, came back no wiser than he went.</P>
<P>My kind QUAKER was more vex'd at the Disap∣pointment, at least apparently so, than I was; and asking the Fellow, if he was sure he knew the Gen∣tleman again if he saw him; the Fellow said, he had follow'd him so close, and took so much Notice of him, in order to do his Errand as it ought to be done, that he was very sure he should know him again; and that besides, he was sure he should know his Horse.</P>
<P>This Part was, indeed, likely enough; and the kind QUAKER, without telling me any Thing of the Matter, caus'd her Man to place himself just at the Corner of <HI>Whitechapple Church Wall</HI> every <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Afternoon, that being the Day when the Citizens chiefly ride Abroad to take the Air; and there to watch all the Afternoon, and look for him.</P>
<P>It was not till the fifth <HI>Saturday,</HI> that her Man came, with a great deal of Joy, and gave her an Account, that he had found out the Gentleman; that he was a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but a <HI>French</HI> Merchant; that he came from <HI>Roan,</HI> and his Name was—, and that he lodg'd at Mr.—on <HI>Laurence Pountney's Hill:</HI> I was surpriz'd, you may be sure, when she came and told me one Evening, all the Particulars, except that of hav∣ing set her Man to watch: I have found out thy <HI>Dutch</HI> Friend, says she, and can tell THEE how to find him too; I colour'd again as red as Fire: Then THOU hast dealt with the Evil One, Friend, <HI>said I very g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avely:</HI> No, no, says she, I have no Familiar; but I tell thee, I have found him for thee, and his Name is so and so; and he lives as above recited.</P>
<P>I was surpriz'd again at this, not being able to ima∣gine how she shou'd come to know all this: However, to put me out of Pain, she told me what she had done; well, said I, thou art very kind, but this is not worth thy Pains; for I know it, 'tis only to satisfy my Curi∣osity, for I shall not send to him upon any Account: Be that as thou wilt, says she; besides, added she, thou art in the right to say so to me; for why shou'd I be
<PB N="231" REF="229"/>
trusted with it? tho' if I were, I assure thee, I shou'd not betray thee: That is very kind, said I, and I be∣lieve thee; and assure thyself, if I do send to him, thou shalt know it, and be trusted with it too</P>
<P>During this Interval of five Weeks, I suffer'd a hun∣dred thousand Perplexitie of Mind. I was thorowly convinc'd I was right as to the Person, that it was the Man; I knew him so well, and saw him so plain, I cou'd not be deceiv'd: I drove out again in the Coach, (on Pretence of Air) almost every Day, in hopes of see∣ing him gain, but was never so lucky as to see him; and now I had made the Discovery, I was as far to seek what Measures to take, as I was before.</P>
<P>To send to him, or speak to him first if I shou'd see him, so as to be known to him, that I resolv'd not to do, if I dy'd for it; to watch him about hi Lodging, that was as much below my Spirit as the other; so that, in a Word, I was at a perfect Loss how to act, or what to do.</P>
<P>At length came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Letter, with the last Account which she had at <HI>Roan,</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, which confirming the other, left me out of Doubt that this was my Man; but still, no human Invention cou'd bring me to the Speech of him, in such a Manner as wou'd suit with my Resolutions; for, after all, how did I know what his Circumstances were? whether marry'd or single? and if he had a Wife, I knew he was so honest a Man, he wou'd not so much as converse with me, or so much as know me, if he met me in the Street.</P>
<P>In the next Place, as he had entirely neglected me, which, in short, is the worst Way of slighting a Wo∣man, and had given no Answer to my Letters, I did not know but he might be the same Man still; so I re∣solv'd, that I cou'd do nothing in it, unless some fairer Opportunity presented, which might make my Way clearer to me; for I was determin'd he shou'd have no Room to put any more Slights upon me</P>
<P>In these Thoughts I pass'd away near three Months: till at last, (being impatient) I resolv'd to send for
<PB N="232" REF="230"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> to come over, and tell her how Things stood, and that I wou'd do nothing till she came. <HI>Amy</HI> in Answer sent me Word, she wou'd come away with all speed, but begg'd of me, that I wou'd enter into no Engage∣ment with him, or any body, till she arriv'd: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut still keeping me in the dark, as to the Thing itself, which she had to say, at which I was heartily vex'd for many Reasons.</P>
<P>But while all these Things were transacting, and Letters and Answers pass'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and I a little slower than usual, at which I was not so well pleas'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I us'd to be with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Dispatch; I say, in this Time the following Scene open'd.</P>
<P>It was one Afternoon, about sour a Clock, my Friendly QUAKER and I sitting in her Chamber <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Stairs, and very chearsul, chatting together, (for she was the best Company in the World) when somebody ringing hastily at the Door, and no Servant just then in the Way, she ran down herself, to the Door: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen a Gentleman appears with a Footman attending, and ma∣king some Apologies, which she did not thorowly un∣derstand, he speaking but broken <HI>English;</HI> he ask'd to speak with me, by the very same Name that I went by in her House; which, by the Way, was not the Name that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil Language, in her Way, brought him into a very handsome Parlour below Stairs, and said, she wou'd go and see whether the Person who lodg'd in her House own'd that Name, and he shou'd hear sarther.</P>
<P>I was a little surpriz'd, even before I knew any Thing of who it was, my Mind foreboding the Thing as it happen'd; <HI>(whence that arises, let the Naturalists explain to us)</HI> but I was frighted, and ready to die, when my QUAKER came up all gay, and crowing; <HI>There,</HI> says she, <HI>is the</HI> Dutch French <HI>Merchant come to see thee:</HI> I cou'd not speak one Word to her, nor stir off of my Chair, but sat as motionless as a Statue: She talk'd a thousand pleasant Things to me, but they made no Impression on me; at last she pull'd me, and teiz'd me,
<PB N="233" REF="231"/>
<HI>Come, come,</HI> says she, <HI>be thyself, and rouze up,</HI> I must go down again to him; what shall I say to him? say, said I, that you have no such body in the House. That I cannot do, says she, because it is not the Truth; be∣sides, I have own'd thou art above; <HI>Come, come, go down with me;</HI> not for a thousand Guineas, said I; well, says she, I'll go and tell him thou wilt come quickly; so, without giving me Time to answer her, away she goes.</P>
<P>A Million of Thoughts circulated in my Head while she was gone, and what to do I cou'd not tell; I saw no Remedy but I must speak with him, but wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> to have shun'd it; yet had I shun'd it, perhaps then I wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> again, that I had seen him; Thus fluctuating and uncon∣cluding were my Thoughts; what I so earnestly de∣sir'd, I declin'd when it offer'd itself; and what now I pretended to decline, was nothing but what I had been at the Expence of 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> to send <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>France</HI> for; and even without any View, or indeed, any ra∣tional Expectation of bringing it to pass; and what, for half a Year before, I was so uneasy about, that I cou'd not be quiet Night or Day, till <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd to go over to enquire after him: In short, my Thoughts were all confus'd, and in the utmost Disorder. I had once refus'd and rejected him, and I repented it hearti∣ly; then I had taken ill his Silence, and in my Mind rejected him again, but had repented that too. Now I had stoop'd so low as to send after him into <HI>France,</HI> which if he had known, perhaps, he had never come after me; and shou'd I reject him a third Time! On the other Hand, he had repented too in his Turn, per∣haps, and not knowing how I had acted, either in stooping to send in Search after him, or in the wicked∣er Part of my Life, was come over hither to seck me again; and I might take him perhaps, with the same Advantages as I might have done before, and wou'd I now be backward to see him! Well, while I was in this Hurry, my Friend the QUAKER, comes up again, and perceiving the Confusion I was in, she runs to her
<PB N="234" REF="232"/>
Closet, and setch'd me a little pleasant Cordial, but I would not taste it: <HI>O,</HI> says she, <HI>I understand thee, be not uneasy, I'll give thee something shall take off all the Smell of it; if he kisses thee a thousand Times, he shall be no wiser;</HI> I thought with myself, Thou art perfectly ac∣quainted with Affairs of this Nature, I think you must govern me now, so I began to incline to go down with her; upon that, I took the Cordial, and she gave me a kind of spicey Preserve after it, whose Flavour was so strong, and yet so deliciously pleasant, that it wou'd cheat the nicest Smelling, and it left not the least Taint of the Cordial on the Breath.</P>
<P>Well, after this, (tho' with some Hesitation still) I went down a Pair of Back-stairs with her, and into a Dining-room, next to the Parlour in which he was; but there I halted, and desir'd she wou'd let me consi∣der of it a little: Well, do so, says she, and left me with more Readiness than she did before; <HI>do, consider and I'll come to thee again.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I hung back with an Awkardness that was real∣ly unfeign'd, yet when she so readily left me, I thought it was not so kind, and I began to think she should have press'd me still on to it; so foolishly backward are we to the Thing, which of all the World we most desire; mocking ourselves with a feign'd Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctance when the Negative shou'd be Death to us; but she was too cunning for me for while I, as it were, blam'd her in my Mind, for not carrying me to him, tho' a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Time I appear'd backward to see him; on a sudden she unlocks the Folding Doors, which look'd into the next Parlour, and throwing them open, <HI>There</HI> says she, (ushering him in) <HI>is the same Person who, suppose, thou enquirest for;</HI> and the same Moment, with a kind of Decency she retir'd, and that so swift, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she wou'd not give us leave hardly to know which Way she went.</P>
<P>I stood up, but was confounded with a sudden En¦quiry in my Thoughts, how I shou'd receive him and with a Resolution as swift as Lightning, in An¦swer to it, said to myself, It shall be COLDLY; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

on a sudden, I put on an Air of Stiffness and Ceremony <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d held it for about two Minutes; but it was with great Difficulty.</P>
<P>He restrained himself too, on the other Hand, came towards me gravely, and saluted me in Form; but it was, it seems, upon his supposing the QUAKER was be∣hind him, whereas she, <HI>as I said,</HI> understood Things too well, and had retir'd, as if she had vanished, that he might have full Freedom; for, <HI>as she said after∣wards,</HI> she supposed we had seen one another before, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t might have been a great a while ago.</P>
<P>Whatever Stiffness I had put on my Behaviour to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was surprized in my Mind, and angry at his, and be∣gan to wonder what kind of a ceremonious Meeting it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as to be. However, after he perceived the Woman was gone, he made a Kind of a Hesitation, looking a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle round him; <HI>Indeed,</HI> said he, <HI>I thought the Gentle∣woman was not withdrawn,</HI> and with that he took me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his Arms, and kiss'd me three or four Times; but I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat was prejudic'd to the last Degree with the Coldness <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his first Salutes, when I did not know the Cause of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, could not be thorowly clear'd of the Prejudice, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did know the Cause; and thought that even his Return, and taking me in his Arms, did not seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the same Ardour with which he us'd to receive me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this made me behave to him awkardly, <HI>and I know <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t how,</HI> for a good while; <HI>but this by the Way</HI></P>
<P>He began with a kind of an Exta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y upon the Subject <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his finding me out; how it was possible that he should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been four Years in <HI>England,</HI> and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us'd all the Ways imaginable, and could never so much as have the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that was now above two Years that he had despair'd of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d had given over all Enquiry; and that now he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould chop upon me, as it were, unlook'd and unsought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</P>
<P>I could easily have accounted for his not finding me, I had but set down the Detail of my real Retirement; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I gave it a new, and indeed a truly hypocritical <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn. I told him that any one that knew the Manner Life I led, might account for his not finding me; that
<PB N="236" REF="234"/>
the Retreat I had taken up, would have render'd it a hundred thousand to one odds that he ever found me a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all; that as I had abandon'd all Conversation, taken u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another Name, liv'd remote from <HI>London,</HI> and had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preserved one Acquaintance in it, it was no Wonder h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had not met with me; that even my Dress would le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him see, that I did not desire to be known by any Body.</P>
<P>Then he asked if I had not received some Letter from him? I told him, No, he had not thought fit to give me the Civility of an Answer to the last I wrote to him and he could not suppose I should expect a Return, after a Silence in a Case where I had laid myself so low, and exposed myself in a Manner I had never been us'd to that indeed I had never sent for any Letters after that, to the Place where I had ordered his to be directed; and that being so justly, as I thought, punished for my Weak¦ness, I had nothing to do, but to repent of being a Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after I had strictly adher'd to a just Principle before That however, as what I did was rather from Motion of Gratitude than from real Weakness, however it might be construed by him, I had the Satisfaction in myself o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having fully discharg'd the Debt. <HI>I added,</HI> that I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not wanted Occasions of all the seeming Advancement which the pretended Felicity of a Marriage-Life wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> usually set off with, and might have been what I desir'd not to name; but that however low I had stoop'd to him I had maintained the Dignity of Female Liberty again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all the Attacks, either of Pride or Avarice; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had been infinitely obliged to him for giving me an Op¦portunity to discharge the only Obligation that endan¦gered me, without subjecting me to the Consequence and that I hop'd he was satisfy'd I had paid the Debt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by offering myself to be chain'd; but was infinitely Debtor to him another Way, for letting me remain free.</P>
<P>He was so confounded at this Discourse, that he knew not what to say, and for a good while he stood mute in¦deed; but recovering himself a little, <HI>he said,</HI> I run ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into a Discourse he hop'd was over and forgotten, and he did not intend to revive it; that he knew I had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HI>He added,</HI> that I might see by all his Conduct since that, what unhappy Mistake drew him into the Thing at first; and that he would have been very far from do∣ing the Injury to me, or being instrumental to add <HI>Une Minerable,</HI> (that was his Word) to the World, if he had not been drawn into it by the Hopes he had of making me his own; but that, if it was possible to rescue the Child from the Consequences of its unhappy Birth, he hop'd I would give him Leave to do it, and he would let me see that he had both Means and Affection still to do it; and that notwithstanding all the Misfortunes that had befallen him, nothing that belong'd to him, especi∣ally by a Mother he had such a Concern for, as he had for me, should ever want what he was in a Condition to do for it.</P>
<P>I could not hear this without being sensibly touched with it; I was ashamed that he should shew that he had more real Affection for the Child, tho' he had never seen it in his Life, than I that bore it; for indeed I did not love the Child, nor love to see it; and tho' I had pro∣vided for it, yet I did it by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Hand, and had not seen it above twice in four Years; being privately re∣solved that when it grew up, it should not be able to call me Mother.</P>
<P>However, <HI>I told him,</HI> the Child was taken Care of, and that he need not be anxious about it, unless he sus∣pected that I had less Affection for it than he, that had never seen it in his Life; that he knew what I had pro∣mised him to do for it, <HI>namely,</HI> to give it the thousand Pistoles which I had offered him, and which he had de∣clined; that, <HI>I assur'd him,</HI> I had made my Will, and that I had left it <HI>5000 l.</HI> and the Interest of it till he should come of Age, if I died before that Time; that I would still be as good as that to it; but if he had a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmd to take it from me, into his Government, I would not be against it; and to satisfy him that I would per∣form what I said, I would cause the Child to be de∣livered to him, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>000 l.</HI> also for its Support; de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending upon it, that he should shew himself a Father <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it, by what I saw of his Affection to it now.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="238"/>
I had observ'd that he had hinted two or three Times in his Discourse, his having had <HI>Misfortunes in the World,</HI> and I was a little surprized at the Expression, especially at the repeating it so often, but I took no Notice of that Part yet.</P>
<P>He thank'd me for my Kindness to the Child, with a Tenderness which shewed the Sincerity of all he had said before; and which encreased the Regret with which, <HI>as I said,</HI> I look'd back on the little Affection I had shew'd to the poor Child. He told me he did not desire to take him from me, but so as to introduce him into the World as his own; which he could still do, having liv'd absent from his other Children (for he had two Sons and a Daughter which were brought up at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> with a Sister of his) so long, that he might very well send another Son of ten Years old to be bred up with them; and suppose his Mother to be dead or alive, as he found Occasion; and that as I had resolved to do so handsomely for the Child, he would add to it something considerable, tho' having had some great Disappoint∣ments, <HI>(repeating the Words)</HI> he could not do for it as he would otherwise have done.</P>
<P>I then thought myself obliged to take Notice of his having so often mentioned his having <HI>met with Disap∣pointments;</HI> I told him I was very sorry to hear he had met with any Thing afflicting to him in the World; that I would not have any Thing belonging to me add to his Loss, or weaken him in what he might do for his other Children; and that I would not agree to his having the Child away, <HI>tho' the Proposal was infinitely to the Child's Advantage,</HI> unless he would promise me, that the whole Expence should be mine; and that if he did not think <HI>5000l.</HI> enough for the Child, I would give it more.</P>
<P>We had so much Discourse upon this, <HI>and the old Af∣fairs,</HI> that it took up all our Time at his first Visit; I was a little importunate with him to tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that Time; and only obtaining my Leave to visit me again, he went away; and indeed my Heart was so full of what he had said already, that I was glad when he went away; some∣times I was full of Tenderness and Affection for him,
<PB N="241" REF="239"/>
and especially, when he express'd himself so earnesily and passionately about the Child; other Times I was crowded with Doubts about his Circumstances; some∣times I was terrify'd with Apprehensions, lest if I should come into a close Correspondence with him, he should any Way come to hear what kind of Life I had led at <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> and in other Places, and it might make me miserable afterwards; from which last Thought I con∣cluded that I had better repulse him again, than receive him: All these Thoughts, and many more crowded in so fast, <HI>I say,</HI> upon me, that I wanted to give Vent to them, and get rid of him, and was very glad when he was gone away.</P>
<P>We had several Meetings after this, in which still we had so many Preliminaries to go through, that we scarce ever border'd upon the main Subject; once indeed he said something of it, and I put it off with a kind of Jest; a∣las! <HI>says I,</HI> those Things are out of the Question now; 'tis almost two Ages since those Things were talk'd between us, <HI>says I;</HI> you see I am grown <HI>an old Woman</HI> since that. Another Time he gave a little Push at it a∣gain, and I laugh'd again; <HI>Why what dost thou talk of,</HI> said I, in a formal Way, <HI>Dost thou not see I am turned</HI> QUAKER? <HI>I cannot speak of those Things now.</HI> Why, <HI>says he,</HI> the QUAKERS marry as well as other People, and love one another as well; besides, <HI>says he,</HI> the QUAKERS Dress does not ill become you, and so jested with me again, and so it went off for a third Time; <HI>however,</HI> I began to be kind to him in Process of Time, <HI>as they call it,</HI> and we grew very intimate; and had not the following Accident unluckily interven'd, I had cer∣tainly married him, or consented to marry him the ve∣ry next Time he had ask'd me.</P>
<P>I had long waited for a Letter from <HI>Amy,</HI> who, it seems, was just at that Time gone to <HI>Roan</HI> the second Time, to make her Enquiries about him; and I re∣ceived a Letter from her at this unhappy Juncture, which gave me the following Account of my Business.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="242" REF="240"/>
I. That for <HI>my Gentleman,</HI> whom I had now, <HI>as I may say,</HI> in my Arms; <HI>she said,</HI> he had been gone from <HI>Paris, as I have hinted,</HI> having met with some great Losses and Misfortunes; that he had been in <HI>Holland</HI> on that very Account, whither he had also carried his Children; that he was after that settled for some Time at <HI>Roan,</HI> that she had been at <HI>Roan;</HI> and found there (by a meer Acci∣dent) from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, that he was at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> had been there above three Years; that he was to be found upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> on the <HI>French</HI> Walk, and that he lodg'd at St. <HI>Lawrence Pount∣ney's-Lane,</HI> and the like; so <HI>Amy</HI> said she suppos'd I might soon find him out, but that she doubted he was poor, and not worth looking after. This she did because of the next Clause, which the Jade had most Mind to on many Accounts.</P>
<P N="2">II. That as to the Prince—, that, <HI>as above,</HI> he was gone into <HI>Germany,</HI> where his Estate lay; that he had quitted the <HI>French</HI> Service, and lived retir'd; that she had seen his Gentleman, who re∣main'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> to sollicit his Arrears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he had given her an Account how his Lord had em∣ployed him to enquire for me, and find me out, <HI>as above,</HI> and told her what Pains he had taken to find me; that he had understood that I was gone to <HI>England,</HI> that he once had Orders to go to <HI>England</HI> to find me; that his Lord had resolved, if he could have found me, to have call'd me <HI>a Countess,</HI> and so have marry'd me, and carried me into <HI>Germany</HI> with him; and that his Commission was still to assure me, that the Prince would many, me, if I would come to him; and that he would send him an Account that he had sound me, and did not doubt but he would have Orders to come over to <HI>England</HI> to attend me, in a Figure suitable to my Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> an ambitious Jade, who knew my weakest Part, <HI>namely,</HI> that I lov'd great Things, and that I lov'd to be flatter'd and courted, said Abundance of kind
<PB N="243" REF="241"/>
Things upon this Occasion, which she knew were suit∣able to me, and would prompt my Vanity; and talk'd big of the Prince's Gentleman having Orders to come over to me, with a Procuration to marry me by Proxy, <HI>(as Princes usually do in like Cases)</HI> and to furnish me with an Equipage, and I know not how many fine Things; but told me withal that she had not yet let him know that she belong'd to me still, or that she knew where to find me, or to write to me; because she was willing to see the Bottom of it, and whether it was a Reality, or a <HI>Gasconade;</HI> she had indeed told him, that if he had any such Commission, she would endea∣vour to find me out; but no more.</P>
<P N="3">III. For <HI>the Jew,</HI> she assur'd me, that she had not been able to come at a Certainty what was become of him, or in what Part of the World he was; but that thus much he had learned from good Hands, that he had committed a Crime, in being concern'd in a Design to rob a rich Banker at <HI>Pa∣ris;</HI> and that he was fled, and had not been heard of there for above six Years.</P>
<P N="4">IV. For that of <HI>my Husband the Brewer,</HI> she learned, that being commanded into the Field upon an Oc∣casion of some Action in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he was wounded at the Battle of <HI>Mons,</HI> and died of his Wounds in the Hospital of the Invalids; so there was an End of my four Enquiries, which I sent her over to make.</P>
<P>This Account of the Prince, and the Return of his Affection to me, with all the flattering great Things which seem'd to come along with it; and especially as they came gilded, and set out by my Maid <HI>Amy; I say,</HI> this Account of the Prince came to me in a very unlucky Hour, and in the very Crisis of my Affair.</P>
<P>The Merchant and I had entered into close Confe∣rences upon the grand Affair. I had left off talking my Platonics, and of my Independency, and being a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iet Woman, as before;</HI> and he having cleared up my Doubts too, as to his Circumstances, and the Misfor∣tunes
<PB N="244" REF="242"/>
tunes he had spoken of, I had gone so far, that we had begun to consider where we should live, and in what Fi∣gure, what Equipage, what House, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>I had made some Harrangues upon the delightful Re∣tirement of a Country Life, and how we might enjoy ourselves so effectually without the Incumbrances of Bu∣siness, and the World; but all this was <HI>Grimace,</HI> and purely because I was afraid to make any public Appear∣ance in the World, for fear some impertinent Person of Quality, should chop upon me again, and cry out, <HI>Roxana, Roxana,</HI> by—, with an Oath, <HI>as had been done before.</HI></P>
<P>My Merchant, bred to Business, and used to converse among Men of Business, could hardly tell how to live without it; at least, it appeared he should be like a Fish out of Water, uneasy and dying; but however, he join'd with me, only argued that we might live as near <HI>London</HI> as we could, that he might sometimes come to <HI>Change,</HI> and hear how the World should go abroad, and how it far'd with his Friends, and his Children.</P>
<P><HI>I answered,</HI> That if he chose still to embarrass him∣self with Business, I supposed it would be more to his Satisfaction to be in his own Country, where his Fa∣mily was so well known, and where his Children al∣so were.</P>
<P>He smiled at the Thoughts of that, <HI>and let me know,</HI> that he should be very willing to embrace such an Offer, but that he could not expect it of me, to whom <HI>England</HI> was, <HI>to be sure,</HI> so naturaliz'd now, as that it would be car∣rying me out of my native Country, which he would not desire by any Means, however agreeable it might be to him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> he was mistaken in me, that as I had told him so much of a married State being a Captivity, and the Family being a House of Bondage, that when I mar∣ried I expected to be but an Upper-servant; so if I did, notwithstanding, submit to it, I hop'd he should see knew how to act the Servant's Part, and do every Thing to oblige my Master; that if I did not resolve to go with him wherever he desired to go, he might depend I would never have him; <HI>and did I not,</HI> said I, <HI>offer mystlf to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with you to the</HI> East-Indies?</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="243"/>
All this while this was indeed but a Copy of my Countenance; for as my Circumstances would not ad∣mit my Stay at <HI>London,</HI> at least, not so as to appear pub∣lickly, I resolved, if I took him, to live remote in the Country, or go out of <HI>England</HI> with him.</P>
<P>But in <HI>an evil Hour,</HI> just now came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Letter, in the very middle of all these Discourses; and the fine Things she had said about <HI>the Prince,</HI> began to make strange Work with me; the Notion of being <HI>a Princess,</HI> and going over to live where all that had happened here would have been quite sunk out of Knowledge, as well as out of Memory, <HI>(Conscience excepted)</HI> was mighty taking; the Thoughts of being surrounded with Domes∣tics, honour'd with Titles, be call'd HER HIGHNESS, and live in all the Splendor of a Court, and, <HI>which was still more,</HI> in the Arms of a Man of such Rank, and who I knew loved and valued me; all this, <HI>in a Word,</HI> dazzled my Eyes, turn'd my Head, and I was as truly craz'd and distracted for about a Fortnight as most of the People in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> tho' perhaps not quite so far gone.</P>
<P>When my Gentleman came to me the next Time, I had no Notion of him, I wish'd I had never received him at all; <HI>in short,</HI> I resolved to have no more to say to him, so I feigned myself indisposed; and tho' I did come down to him, and speak to him a little, yet I let him see that I was so ill that I was <HI>(as we say)</HI> no Company, and that it would be kind in him to give me Leave to quit him for that Time.</P>
<P>The next Morning he sent a Footman to enquire how I did; and I let him know I had a violent Cold, and was very ill with it; two Days after he came again, and I let him see me again, but feigned myself so hoarse that I could not speak to be heard, and that it was pain∣ful to me but to whisper; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> I held him in this Suspense near three Weeks.</P>
<P>During this Time I had a strange Elevation upon my Mind; and the Prince, <HI>or the Spirit of him,</HI> had such a Possession of me, that I spent most of this Time in the reallizing all the great Things of <HI>a Life with the Prince</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="244"/>
to my Mind, pleasing my Fancy with the Grandeur I was supposing myself to enjoy, and withal, wickedly studying in what Manner to put off this Gentleman, and be rid of him forever.</P>
<P>I cannot but say that sometimes the Baseness of the Action stuck hard with me; the Honour and Sincerity with which he had always treated me, and, <HI>above all,</HI> the Fidelity he had shewed me at <HI>Paris,</HI> and that I ow'd my Life to him, <HI>I say,</HI> all these stared in my Face, and I frequently argued with myself upon the Obligation I was under to him, and how base would it be, <HI>now too, after many Obligations and Engagements,</HI> to cast him off?</P>
<P>But the Title of <HI>Highness,</HI> and of a <HI>Princess,</HI> and all those fine Things, as they came in, weighed down all this; <HI>and the Sense of Gratitude vanished, as if it had been a Shadow.</HI></P>
<P>At other Times I considered the Wealth I was Mi∣stress of; that I was able to live like a Princess, tho' not a Princess; and that my Merchant <HI>(for he had told me all the Affair of his Misfortunes)</HI> was far from being poor, or even mean; that together, we were able to make up an Estate of between three and four thousand Pounds a Year, which was in itself equal to some Princes abroad. But tho' this was true, yet the Name of <HI>Princess,</HI> and the Flutter of it, <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Pride weighed them down; and all these Arguings generally ended to the Disadvantage of my Merchant; so that, <HI>in short,</HI> I re∣solved to drop him, and give him a final Answer at his next coming; <HI>namely,</HI> That something had happened in my Affairs, which had caused me to alter my Mea∣sures unexpectedly; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> to desire him to trouble himself no farther.</P>
<P>I think verily this rude Treatment of him, was for some Time, the Effect of a violent Fermentation in my Blood; for the very Motion which the steddy Contem∣plation of my fancy'd Greatness had put my Spirits into, had thrown me into a kind of Fever, and I scarce knew what I did.</P>
<P>I have wondered since that it did not make me mad; nor do I now think it strange to hear of those, who have
<PB N="247" REF="245"/>
been quite <HI>Lunatic</HI> with their Pride; that fancy'd them∣selves Queens and Empresses, and have made their At∣tendants serve them upon the Knee, given Visitors their Hand to kiss, <HI>and the like;</HI> for certainly, if Pride will not turn the Brain, nothing can.</P>
<P>However, the next Time my Gentleman came, I had not Courage enough, <HI>or not Ill-nature enough,</HI> to treat him in the rude Manner I had resolved to do, and it was very well I did not; for soon after I had another Let∣ter from <HI>Amy,</HI> in which was the mortifying News, and indeed surprizing to me, that my Prince <HI>(as I with a secret Pleasure had called him)</HI> was very much hurt by a Bruise he had received in hunting and engaging with a wild Boar; a cruel and desperate Sport, which the Noblemen of <HI>Germany,</HI> it seems, much delight in.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me indeed, and the more, because <HI>Amy</HI> wrote me Word, that his Gentleman was gone away express to him, not without Apprehensions, that he should find his Master was dead, before his coming Home; but that he <HI>[the Gentleman]</HI> had promised her, that so soon as he arrived he would send back the same Courier to her, with an Account of his Master's Health, and of the main Affair; and that he had oblig'd <HI>Amy</HI> to stay at <HI>Paris</HI> fourteen Days for his Return; she having promis'd him before to make it her Business to go to <HI>England,</HI> and to find me out for his Lord, if he sent her such Orders; and he was to send her a Bill for fifty Pi∣stoles for her Journey. So <HI>Amy</HI> told me she waited for the Answer.</P>
<P>This was a Blow to me several Ways; for <HI>first,</HI> I was in a State of Uncertainty as to his Person, whether he was alive or dead; and I was not unconcerned in that Part, I assure you; for I had an inexpressible Affection remaining for his Person, besides the Degree to which it was reviv'd by the View of a firmer Interest in him; <HI>but this was not all,</HI> for in losing him I for ever lost the Prospect of all the Gaiety and Glory, that had made such an Impression upon my Imagination.</P>
<P>In this State of Uncertainty, <HI>I say,</HI> by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Let∣ter, I was like still to remain another Fortnight; and
<PB N="248" REF="246"/>
had I now continued the Resolution of using my Mer∣chant in the rude Manner I once intended, I had made perhaps a sorry Piece of Work of it indeed, and it was very well my Heart fail'd me, <HI>as it did.</HI></P>
<P>However, I treated him with a great many Shuffles, and feigned Stories to keep him off from any closer Con∣ferences than we had already had, that I might act af∣terwards as Occasion might offer, one Way or other: But that which mortify'd me most, was, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not write, tho' the fourteen Days was expired. At last, to my great Surprize, when I was with the utmost Im∣patience, looking out at the Window, expecting the Post-man, that usually brought the Foreign Letters; <HI>I say,</HI> I was agreeably surprized to see a Coach come to the Yard-Gate where we lived, and my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> a∣light out of it, and come towards the Door, having the Coachman bringing several Bundles after her.</P>
<P>I flew like Lightning down Stairs to speak to her; but was soon damp'd with her News. Is the Prince a∣live or dead, <HI>Amy? says I:</HI> She spoke coldly and slight∣ly: <HI>He is alive, Madam,</HI> said she, <HI>but it is not much Matter, I had as lieu he had been dead.</HI> So we went up Stairs again to my Chamber, and there we began a se∣rious Discourse of the whole Matter.</P>
<P>First, <HI>she told me a long Story</HI> of his being hurt by a Wild-boar, and of the Condition he was reduced to, so that every one expected he should die, the Anguish of the Wound having thrown him into a Fever, with A∣bundance of Circumstances too long to relate here, how he recovered of that extreme Danger, but continued ve∣ry weak, how the Gentleman had been <HI>Homme de Pa∣role,</HI> and had sent back the Courier as punctually as if it had been to the KING, that he had given a long Ac∣count of his Lord, and of his Illness and Recovery; but the Sum of the Matter, <HI>as to me,</HI> was, That as to the Lady, his Lord was turned Penitent, was under some Vows for his Recovery, and could not think any more on that Affair; and especially, the Lady being gone, and that it had not been offer'd to her, so there was no Breach of Honour, but that his Lord was sensible of the good Of∣fices
<PB N="249" REF="247"/>
of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and had sent her the fifty Pistoles for her Trouble, as if she had really gone the Journey.</P>
<P>I was, I confess, hardly able to bear the first Sur∣prize of this Disappointment; <HI>Amy,</HI> saw it, and gapes out, (as was her Way) Law'd Madam! never be con∣cern'd at it; you see he is gotten among the Priests; and I suppose, they have saucily impos'd some Pennance upon him; and it may be, sent him of an Errand bare∣foot to some <HI>Madonna</HI> or <HI>Nosterdame</HI> or other; and he is off of his Amours for the present; I'll warrant you, he'll be as wicked again as ever he was, when he is got thorow well, and gets but out of their Hands a∣gain, I hate this out-o'-Season Repentance; what Oc∣casion had he, in his Repentance, to be off of taking a good Wife? I shou'd have been glad to see you have been a Princess, and all that; but if it can't be, never afflict yourself; you are rich enough to be a Princess to yourself; you don't want him, that's the best of it.</P>
<P>Well, I cry'd for all that, and was heartily vex'd, and that a great while; but as <HI>Amy</HI> was always at my Elbow, and always jogging it out of my Head, with her Mirth, and her Wit, it wore off again.</P>
<P>Then I told <HI>Amy</HI> all the Story of my Merchant, and how he had found me out, when I was in such a Con∣cern to find him; how it was true, that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountney's Lane;</HI> and how I had had all the Story of his Misfortunes, which she had heard of, in which he had lost above 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and that he had told me frankly of it, before she had sent me any Account of it, or, at least, before I had taken any No∣tice that I had heard of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was very joyful at that Part. Well, Madam then, says <HI>Amy,</HI> what need you value the Story of the Prince? and going I know not whither into <HI>Germany,</HI> to lay your Bones in another World, and learn the De∣vil's Language, call'd HIGH-DUTCH? You are better here by half, says <HI>Amy:</HI> Law'd Madam, says she, why are you not as rich as <HI>Crassus?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="248"/>
Well, it was a great while still, before I cou'd bring myself off of this fancy'd Sovereignty; and I that was so willing once to be Mistress to a KING, was now ten thousand Times more fond of being Wife to a Prince.</P>
<P>So fast a Hold has Pride and Ambition upon our Minds, that when once it gets Admission, nothing is so chimerical, but under this Possession we can form <HI>Ideas</HI> of in our Fancy, and reallize to our Imagination: Nothing can be so ridiculous as the simple Steps we take in such Cases; a Man or a Woman becomes a meer <HI>Malade Imaginaire,</HI> and I believe, may as easily die with Grief, or run mad with Joy, (as the Affair in his Fancy appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actually under the Management of the Person.</P>
<P>I had indeed, two Assistants to deliver me from this Snare, and these were, <HI>first, Amy,</HI> who knew my Dis∣ease, but was able to do nothing as to the Remedy; the <HI>second,</HI> the Merchant, who really brought the Remedy, but knew nothing of the Distemper.</P>
<P>I remember, when all these Disorders were upon my Thoughts, in one of the Visits my Friend the Merchant made me, he took Notice, that he perceiv'd I was un∣der some unusual Disorder; he believ'd, he said, that my Distemper, whatever it was, lay much in my Head, and it being Summer Weather, and very hot, propos'd to me to go a little Way into the Air.</P>
<P>I started at his Expression; what says I, do you think then, that I am craz'd? you shou'd then propose a Mad-House for my Cure: No, no, says he, I do not mean any Thing like that, I hope the Head may be distem∣per'd, and not the Brain: Well, I was too sensible that he was right, for I knew I had acted a strange wild kind of Part with him; but he insisted upon it, and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d me to go into the Country: I took him short again, What need you, says I, send me out of your Way? It is in your Power to be less troubled with me, and with less Inconvenience to us both.</P>
<P>He took that ill, and told me I us'd to have a better Opinion of his Sincerity; and desir'd to know what he
<PB N="251" REF="249"/>
had done to forfeit my Charity: I mention this, only to let you see how far I had gone in my Measures of quitting him, that is to say, how near I was of shew∣ing him how base, ungrateful, and how vilely I cou'd act: But I found I had carried the Jest far enough, and that a little Matter might have made him sick of me again, as he was before; so I began, by little and little, to change my Way of talking to him, and to come to Discourse to the Purpose again, as we had done before.</P>
<P>A while after this, when we were very merry, and talking familiarly together, he call'd me with an Air of particular Satisfaction, <HI>his Princess.</HI> I colour'd at the Word, <HI>for it indeed touch'd me to the quick;</HI> but he knew nothing of the Reason of my being touch'd with it: What d'ye mean by that, said I? Nay, says he, I mean nothing, but that you are a Princess to me: Well, says I, as to that, I am content; and yet I cou'd tell you, I might have been a Princess if I wou'd have quitted you, and believe I cou'd be so still: It is not in my Power to make you a Princess, says he, but I can easily make you a Lady, here in <HI>England,</HI> and a Countess too, if you will go out of it.</P>
<P>I heard both with a great deal of Satisfaction, for my Pride remain'd, tho' it had been baulk'd, and I thought with myself, that this Proposal wou'd make some Amends for the Loss of the Title that had so tickl'd my Imagination another Way; and I was impatient to un∣derstand what he meant; but I wou'd not ask him by any Means; so it pass'd off for that Time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I told <HI>Amy</HI> what he had said, and <HI>Amy</HI> was as impatient to know the Manner how it cou'd be, as I was; but the next Time, (perfectly unexpected to me) he told me, that he had accidental∣ly mention'd a Thing to me, last Time he was with me, having not the least Thought of the Thing itself; but not knowing but such a Thing might be of some Weight to me, and that it might bring me Respect among People where I might appear, he had thought since of it, and was resolv'd to ask me about it.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="250"/>
I made light of it, and told him, that as he knew I had chosen a retir'd Life, it was of no Value to me to be call'd LADY, or COUNTESS either; but that if he intended to drag me, as I might call it, into the World again, perhaps it might be agreeable to him; but, besides that, I cou'd not judge of the Thing, be∣cause I did not understand how either of them was to be done.</P>
<P>He told me, that Money purchas'd Titles of Honour in almost all Parts of the World; tho' Money cou'd not give Principles of Honour, they must come by Birth and Blood; that however, Titles sometimes assist to elevate the Soul, and to infuse generous Principles into the Mind, and especially, where there was a good Foundation laid in the Persons; that he hop'd, we shou'd neither of us misbehave, if we came to it; and that as we knew how to wear a Title without undue Elevations, so it might sit as well upon us, as on ano∣ther; that as to <HI>England,</HI> he had nothing to do, but to get an Act of Naturalization in his Favour, and he knew where to purchase a Patent for BARONET, that is to say, to have the Honour and Title transferr'd to him; but if I intended to go Abroad with him, he had a Nephew, the Son of his Elder Brother, who had the Title of COUNT; with the Estate annex'd, which was but small; and that he had frequently offer'd to make it over to him for a thousand Pistoles, which was not a great deal of Money; and considering it was in the Fa∣mily already, he wou'd, upon my being willing, pur∣chase it immediately.</P>
<P>I told him, I lik'd the last best; but then, I wou'd not let him buy it, unless he wou'd let me pay the thousand Pistoles: No, no, says he, I refus'd a thousand Pistoles that I had more Right to have accepted than that, and you shall not be at so much Expence now: Yes, says I, you did refuse it, and perhaps, repented it afterwards: I never complain'd, says he; but I did, says I, and often repented it for you: I do not under∣stand you, says he: Why, says I, I repented that I
<PB N="253" REF="251"/>
suffer'd you to refuse it: Well, well, said he, we may talk of that hereafter, when you shall resolve which Part of the World you will make your settled Residence in: Here he talk'd very handsomely to me, and for a good while together; how it had been his Lot to live all his Days out of his Native Country, and to be often shifting and changing the Situation of his Affairs; and that I myself had not always had a fix'd Abode, but that now, as neither of us was very young, he fancy'd I wou'd be for taking up our Abode, where, if possible, we might remove no more; that as to his Part, he was of that Opinion entirely, only with this Exception, that the Choice of the Place should be mine; for, that all Places in the World were alike to him, only with this single Addition, namely, that I was with him.</P>
<P>I heard him with a great deal of Pleasure, as well for his being willing to give me the Choice, as for that I resolv'd to live Abroad, for the Reason I have men∣tion'd already, <HI>namely,</HI> lest I should at any Time be known in <HI>England,</HI> and all that Story of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Balls, shou'd come out; as also I was not a little tickl'd with the Satisfaction of being still a <HI>Countess,</HI> tho' I cou'd not be a <HI>Princess.</HI></P>
<P>I told <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> all this Story, for she was still my Privy-Counsellor; but when I ask'd her Opinion, she made me laugh heartily: <HI>Now, which of the two shall I take,</HI> Amy? <HI>said I;</HI> shall I be a Lady, <HI>that is,</HI> a Baronet's Lady in <HI>England,</HI> or a Countess in <HI>Holland?</HI> the ready witted Jade, that knew the Pride of my Temper too, almost as well as I did myself, answer'd, (without He∣sitation) <HI>Both, Madam;</HI> which of them! says she, (re∣peating the Words) why not both of them? and then you will be really a <HI>Princess;</HI> for sure, to be a Lady in <HI>English,</HI> and a Countess in <HI>Dutch,</HI> may make a Princess in <HI>High Dutch:</HI> Upon the whole, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was in jest, she put the Thought into my Head, and I resolv'd, that, in short, I wou'd be both of them; which I ma∣nag'd as you shall hear.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="252"/>
<HI>First,</HI> I seem'd to resolve that I wou'd live and settle in <HI>England,</HI> only with this Condition, <HI>namely,</HI> that I wou'd not live in <HI>London.</HI> I pretended that it wou'd choak me up; that I wanted Breath when I was in <HI>London;</HI> but that any where else I wou'd be satisfied; and then I ask'd him, whether any Sea-Port Town in <HI>England</HI> wou'd not suit him? because I knew, tho' he seem'd to leave off, he wou'd always love to be among Business, and conversing with Men of Business; and I nam'd several Places, either nearest for Business with <HI>France,</HI> or with <HI>Holland;</HI> as <HI>Dover,</HI> or <HI>Southampton</HI> for the <HI>first;</HI> and <HI>Ipswich,</HI> or <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> or <HI>Hull</HI> for the <HI>last;</HI> but I took Care that we wou'd resolve upon no∣thing; only by this it seem'd to be certain, that we shou'd live in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was Time now, to bring Things to a Conclusion, and so in about six Weeks Time more, we settled all our Preliminaries; and among the rest, he let me know, that he should have the Bill for his <HI>Naturalization</HI> pass'd Time enough; so that he wou'd be, (as he call'd it) an <HI>Englishman,</HI> before we marry'd: That was soon per∣fected, the Parliament being then sitting, and several other Foreigners joining in the said Bill, to save the Expence.</P>
<P>It was not above three or four Days after, but that, without giving me the least Notice that he had so much as been about the Patent for <HI>Baronet,</HI> he brought it me in a fine embroider'd bag; and saluting me by the Name of my Lady—(joining his own Sirname to it) presented it to me, with his Picture set with Diamonds; and at the same Time, gave me a Breast Jewel worth a thousand Pistoles, and the next Morning we were mar∣ry'd: Thus I put an End to all the intriguing Part of my Life; a Life full of prosperous Wickedness; the Reflections upon which, were so much the more afflic∣ting, as the Time had been spent in the grossest Crimes, which the more I look'd back upon, the more black and horrid they appear'd, effectually drinking up all the Comfort and Satisfaction which I might otherwise
<PB N="255" REF="253"/>
have taken in that Part of Life which was still before me.</P>
<P>The first Satisfaction, however, that I took in the new Condition I was in, was in reflecting, that at length the Life of Crime was over; and that I was like a Passenger coming back from the <HI>Indies,</HI> who having, after may Years Fatigue and Hurry in Business, got∣ten a good Estate, with innumerable Difficulties and Hazards, is arriv'd safe at <HI>London</HI> with all his Effects, and has the Pleasure of saying, he shall never venture upon the Seas any more.</P>
<P>When we were marry'd, we came back immediately to my Lodgings, (for the Church was but just by) and we were so privately marry'd, that none but <HI>Amy</HI> and my Friend the QUAKER, was acquainted with it: As soon as we came into the House, he took me in his Arms, and kissing me, <HI>Now you are my own, says he, O!</HI> that you had been so good to have done this eleven Years ago: Then, said I, you <HI>perhaps, wou'd have been t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd of me long ago;</HI> 'tis much better now; for now all our happy Days are to come; besides, said I, I should not have been half so rich; but that I said to myself, for there was no letting him into the Reason of it: O! says he, I shou'd not been tir'd of you; but besides hav∣ing the Satisfaction of your Company, it had sav'd me that unlucky Blow at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was a dead Loss to me of above 8000 Pistoles, and all the Fatigues of so many Years Hurry and Business; and then he added, but I'll make you pay for it all, now I have you: I started a little at the Words: Ay, said I, <HI>do you threat∣en already?</HI> Pray what d'ye mean by that? <HI>and began to look a little grave.</HI></P>
<P>I'll tell you, says he, very plainly what I mean, and still he held me fast in his Arms. I intend from this Time, never to trouble myself with any more Busi∣ness; so I shall never get one Shilling for you, more than I have already; all that you will lose one Way; <HI>next,</HI> I intend not to trouble myself with any of the Care or Trouble of managing what either you have for
<PB N="256" REF="254"/>
me, or what I have to add to it; but you shall e'en take it all upon yourself, as the Wives do in <HI>Holland,</HI> so you will pay for it that Way too; for all the Drudgery shall be yours; <HI>thirdly,</HI> I intend to condemn you to the Con∣stant Bondage of my impertinent Company, for I shall tie you like a Pedlar's Pack, at my Back, I shall scarce ever be from you; for, I am sure, I can take Delight in nothing else in this World: Very well, says I, but I am pretty heavy, I hope you'll set me down some∣times, when you are a weary; as for that, says he, tire me, if you can.</P>
<P>This was all Jest and Allegory; but it was all true, in the Moral of the Fable, as you shall hear in its Place: We were very merry the rest of the Day, but without any Noise, or Clutter; for he brought not one of his Acquaintance, or Friends, either <HI>English,</HI> or Foreign∣er: The honest QUAKER provided us a very noble Dinner indeed, considering how few we were to eat it; and every Day that Week she did the like, and wou'd, at last, have it be all at her own Charge, which I was utterly averse to; <HI>first,</HI> because I knew her Circum∣stances not to be very great, tho' not very low; <HI>and next,</HI> because she had been so true a Friend, and so chearful a Comforter to me, ay, and Counsellor too, in all this Affair, that I had resolv'd to make her a Present, that shou'd be some Help to her when all was over.</P>
<P>But to return to the Circumstances of our Wedding; after being very merry, as I have told you, <HI>Amy</HI> and the QUAKER, put us to Bed, and the honest QUAKER little thinking we had been a Bed together eleven Years be∣fore; nay, that was a Secret which, as it happen'd, <HI>Amy</HI> herself did not know: <HI>Amy</HI> grinn'd, and made Faces, as if she had been pleas'd; but it came out in so many Words, when he was not by; the Sum of her mumbling and muttering was, that this shou'd have been done ten or a dozen Years before; that it wou'd fignify little now; that was to say, in short, that her Mistress was pretty near Fifty, and too old to have
<PB N="257" REF="255"/>
any Children. I chid her, the QUAKER laugh'd, com∣plimented me upon my not being so old as <HI>Amy</HI> pre∣tended, that I cou'd not be above Forty, and might have a House full of Children yet; but <HI>Amy</HI> and I too, knew better than she, how it was, for, in short, I was old enough to have done breeding, however I look'd; but I made her hold her Tongue.</P>
<P>In the Morning my QUAKER Landlady came and vi∣sited us, before we were up, and made us eat Cakes, and drink Chocolate in Bed; and then left us again, and bid us take a Nap upon it, which I believe we did; in short, she treated us so handsomly, and with such an agreeable Chearfulness, as well as Plenty, as made it appear to me, that QUAKERS may, and that this QUAKER did, understand good Manners, as well as any other People.</P>
<P>I resisted her Offer, <HI>however,</HI> of treating us for the the whole Week; and I oppos'd it so long, that I saw evidently that she took it ill, and wou'd have thought herself slighted, if we had not accepted it; so I said no more, but let her go on, only told her, I wou'd be even with her, and so I was: However, for that Week she treated us, as she said she wou'd, and did it so very fine, and with such a Profusion of all Sorts of good Things, that the greatest Burthen to her was, how to dispose of Things that were left; for she never let any Thing, how dainty, or however large, be so much as seen twice among us.</P>
<P>I had some Servants indeed, which help'd her off a little; that is to say, two Maids, for <HI>Amy</HI> was now a Woman of Business, not a Servant, and eat always with us; I had also a Coachman, and a Boy; my QUAKER had a Man Servant too, but had but one Maid; but she borrow'd two more of some of her Friends, for the Occasion, and had a Man Cook for dressing the Vic∣tuals.</P>
<P>She was only at a Loss for Plate, which she gave me a Whisper of; and I made <HI>Amy</HI> fetch a large strong Box, which I had lodg'd in a safe Hand, in which was
<PB N="258" REF="256"/>
all the fine Plate, which I had provided on a worse Oc∣casion, as is mention'd before, and I put it into the QUAKER's Hand, obliging her not to use it as mine, but as her own, for a Reason I shall mention presently.</P>
<P>I was now my Lady—, and I must own, I was exceedingly pleas'd with it, 'twas so Big, and so Great to hear myself call'd <HI>Her Ladyship,</HI> and <HI>Your Ladyship,</HI> and the like, that I was like the <HI>Indian</HI> King at <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> who having a House built for him by the <HI>English,</HI> and a Lock put upon the Door, wou'd sit whole Days together, with the Key in his Hand, locking and un∣locking, and double locking the Door, with an unac∣countable Pleasure at the Novelty; so I cou'd have sat a whole Day together, to hear <HI>Amy</HI> talk to me, and call me <HI>Your Ladyship</HI> at every Word; but after a while the Novelty wore off, and the Pride of it abated, till at last, truly, I wanted the other Title as much as I did that of <HI>Ladyship</HI> before.</P>
<P>We liv'd this Week in all the innocent Mirth imagi∣nable, and our good humour'd QUAKER was so plea∣sant in her Way, that it was particularly entertaining to us. We had no Musick at all, or Dancing; only I now and then sung a <HI>French</HI> Song to divert my Spouse, who desir'd it, and the Privacy of our Mirth greatly added to the Pleasure of it. I did not make many Cloaths for my Wedding, having always a great many rich Cloaths by me, which with a little altering for the Fashion, were perfectly new: The next Day he press'd me to dress, tho' we had no Company; at last, jesting with him, I told him, I believ'd I was able to dress me so, in one kind of Dress that I had by me, that he wou'd not know his Wife when he saw her, especially if any Body else was by: <HI>No!</HI> he said, <HI>that was impes∣sible;</HI> and he long'd to see that Dress. I told him, I wou'd dress me in it, if he wou'd promise me never to desire me to appear in it before Company; he pro∣mis'd he wou'd not, but wanted to know why too; as Husbands, you know, are inquisitive Creatures, and love to enquire after any Thing they think is kept from
<PB N="259" REF="257"/>
them; but I had an Answer ready for him; because, <HI>said I,</HI> it is not a decent Dress in this Country, and would not look modest; neither, indeed, would it, for it was but one Degree off from appearing in one's Shift; but was the usual Wear in the Country where they were used. He was satisfy'd with my Answer, and gave me his Promise never to ask me to be seen in it before Com∣pany. I then withdrew, taking only <HI>Amy</HI> and the QUAKER with me; and <HI>Amy</HI> dress'd me in my old <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit which I danc'd in formerly, <HI>&amp;c. as be∣fore.</HI> The QUAKER was charmed with the Dress, <HI>and merrily said.</HI> That if such a Dress should come to be worn here, she should not know what to do, she should be tempted not to dress in the QUAKERS Way any more.</P>
<P>When all the Dress was put on, I loaded it with Jew∣els, and in particular, I plac'd the large Breast-Jewel which he had given me of a thousand Pistoles, upon the Front of the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dress, where it made a most glorious Shew indeed. I had my own Diamond-Necklace on, and my Hair was <HI>Tout Brilliant,</HI> all glit∣tering with Jewels.</P>
<P>His Picture set with Diamonds, I had plac'd stitch'd to my Vest, just, <HI>as might be supposed,</HI> upon my Heart, (which is the Compliment in such Cases among the <HI>Eastern</HI> People) and all being open at the Breast, there was no Room for any Thing of a Jewel there. In this Figure, <HI>Amy</HI> holding the Train of my Robe, I came down to him. He was surprized, and perfectly asto∣nished. He knew me, <HI>to be sure,</HI> because I had pre∣pared, and because I had prepared him, and because there was no Body else there, but the QUAKER and <HI>Amy,</HI> but he by no Means knew <HI>Amy,</HI> for she had dress'd herself in the Habit of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave, being the Garb of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> which I had at <HI>Naples, as I have said;</HI> she had her Neck and Arms bare, was bare-headed, and her Hair breeded in a long Tossel hanging down her Back; but the Jade could neither hold her Countenance, or her chattering Tongue, so as to be concealed long.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="258"/>
Well, he was so charm'd with this Dress that he would have me sit and dine in it; but it was so thin, and so open before, and the Weather being also sharp, that I was afraid of taking Cold; however the Fire be∣ing enlarged, and the Doors kept shut, I sat to oblige him; and he profess'd he never saw so fine a Dress in his Life. I afterwards told him that my Husband <HI>(so he called the Jeweller that was killed)</HI> bought it for me at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> with a young <HI>Turkish</HI> Slave which I parted with at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that it was by the Help of that Slave that I learned how to dress in it, and how every Thing was to be worn, and many of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Customs also, with some of their Language. This Story agreeing with the Fact, only changing the Person, was very natural, and so it went off with him; but there was good Reason why I should not receive any Company in this Dress, <HI>that is to say,</HI> not in <HI>England; I need not repeat it, you will hear more of it.</HI></P>
<P>But when I came abroad I frequently put it on, and upon two or three Occasions danc'd in it, but always at his Request.</P>
<P>We continued at the QUAKER'S Lodgings for above a Year; for now making as tho' it was difficult to deter∣mine where to settle in <HI>England</HI> to his Satisfaction, un∣less in <HI>London,</HI> which was not to mine, I pretended to make him an Offer, that to oblige him, I began to in∣cline to go and live abroad with him; that I knew no∣thing could be more agreeable to him, and that as to me, every Place was alike; that as I had lived abroad without a Husband so many Years, it could be no Bur∣then to me to live abroad again, <HI>especially with him.</HI> Then we fell to straining our Courtesies upon one another; he told me he was perfectly easy at living in <HI>England,</HI> and had squar'd all his Affairs accordingly; for that, as he had told me he intended to give over all Business in the World, as well the Care of managing it, as the Concern about it, seeing we were both in Condition, neither to want it, or to have it be worth our while; so I might see it was his Intention, by his getting himself naturaliz'd, and getting the Patent of Baronet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="259"/>
Well, for all that, I told him I accepted his Compli∣ment, but I could not but know that his native Country, where his Children were breeding up, must be most a∣greeable to him, and that if I was of such Value to him, I would be there then to enhanse the Rate of his Satis∣faction; that wherever he was would be a Home to me, and any Place in the World would be <HI>England</HI> to me, if he was with me; and thus, <HI>in short,</HI> I brought him to give me leave to oblige him with going to live abroad; when in Truth, I could not have been perfectly easy at living in <HI>England,</HI> unless I had kept constantly within Doors; lest some Time or other the dissolute Life I had lived here should have come to be known, and all those wicked Things have been known too, which I now be∣gan to be very much asham'd of.</P>
<P>When we closed up our Wedding-week, in which our QUAKER had been so very handsome to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for her ge∣nerous Carriage to us, how she had acted the kindest Part thro' the whole, and how faithful a Friend she had been to me upon all Occasions; and then letting him know a little of her Family Unhappinesses, I proposed, that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but really to do something extraordinary for her, to∣wards making her easy in her Affairs. <HI>And I added,</HI> that I had no Hangers-on that should trouble him, that there was no Body belong'd to me but what was thorow∣ly provided for; and that if I did something for this ho∣nest Woman, that was considerable, it should be the last Gift I would give to any Body in the World, but <HI>Amy;</HI> and as for her, we were not a going to turn her a∣drift, but whenever any Thing offered for her, we would do as we saw Cause; that, <HI>in the mean Time, Amy</HI> was not poor, that she had saved together between seven and eight hundred Pounds; <HI>by the Way, I did not tell him how, and by what wicked Ways she had got it;</HI> but <HI>that she had it;</HI> and that was enough to let him know she would never be in Want of us.</P>
<P>My Spouse was exceedingly pleased with my Dis∣course about the QUAKER, made a kind of a Speech to
<PB N="262" REF="260"/>
me upon the Subject of Gratitude, <HI>told me,</HI> it was one of the brightest Parts of a Gentlewoman, that it was so twisted with Honesty, <HI>nay,</HI> and even with Religion too, that he questioned whether either of them could be found, where Gratitude was not to be found; that in this Act there was not only Gratitude but Charity; and that to make the Charity still more Christian-like, the Object too had real Merit to attract it; he therefore agreed to the Thing with all his Heart, only would have had me let him pay it out of his Effects.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>as for that,</HI> I did not design, <HI>whatever I had said formerly,</HI> that we should have <HI>two Pockets;</HI> and that tho' I had talked to him of being a free Wo∣man, and an Independant, <HI>and the like,</HI> and he had of∣fered and promised that I should keep all my own Es∣tate in my own Hands; yet, that since I had taken him, I would even do as other <HI>honest Wives</HI> did, where I thought fit to give myself, I should give what I had too; that if I reserved any Thing it should be only in Case of Mortality, and that I might give it to his Children af∣terwards, <HI>as my own Gift;</HI> and that, <HI>in short,</HI> if he thought fit to join Stocks, we should see to morrow Morn∣ing, what Strength we could both make up in the World, and bringing it all together, consider before we resolved upon the Place of removing, how we should dis∣pose of what we had, as well as of ourselves. This Discourse was too obliging, and he too much a Man of Sense not to receive it, as it was meant; <HI>he only answer∣ed,</HI> We would do in that, as we should both agree; but the Thing under our present Care, was to shew not Gra∣titude only, but Charity and Affection too, to our kind Friend the QUAKER; and the first Word he spoke of, was to settle a thousand Pounds upon her, <HI>for her Life, that is to say,</HI> sixty Pounds a Year; but in such a Manner as not to be in the Power of any Person to reach, but herself. This was a great Thing, and indeed shewed the generous Principles of my Husband, and for that Reason I men∣tion it; but I thought that a little too much too, and particularly, because I had another Thing in View for her, about the Plate; so I told him I thought if he gave
<PB N="263" REF="261"/>
her a Purse with a hundred Guineas as a Present <HI>first,</HI> and then made her a Compliment of 40 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> for her Life, secured any such Way as she should desire, it would be very handsome.</P>
<P>He agreed to that; and the same Day in the Even∣ing, when we were just going to Bed, he took my QUAKER by the Hand, and with a Kiss, told her, that we had been very kindly treated by her from the Be∣ginning of this Affair, and his Wife before, as she <HI>(mean∣ing me)</HI> had informed him; and that he thought him∣self bound to let her see that she had obliged Friends who knew how to be grateful; that for his Part of the Ob∣ligation, he desired she would accept of <HI>that,</HI> for an Acknowledgement in Part only, <HI>(putting the Gold into her Hand)</HI> and that his Wife would talk with her about what farther he had to say to her; and upon that, not giving her Time hardly to say <HI>thank ye,</HI> away he went up Stairs into our Bed-chamber, leaving her confused, and not knowing what to say.</P>
<P>When he was gone, she began to make very hand∣some and obliging Representations of her good Will to us both, but that it was without Expectation of Reward; that I had given her several valuable Presents before, <HI>and so indeed I had;</HI> for, besides the Piece of Linnen which I given her <HI>at first,</HI> I had given her a Suit of Damask <HI>Table-linnen,</HI> of the Linnen I bought for my Balls, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Table-cloths, and three dozen of Napkins; and at another Time I gave her a little Necklace of Gold-Beads, <HI>and the like;</HI> but this is <HI>by the Way;</HI> but she mentioned them, <HI>I say;</HI> and how she was obliged by me on many other Occasions; that she was not in Con∣dition to shew her Gratitude any other Way, not being able to make a suitable Return; and that now we took from her all Opportunity to ballance my former Friend∣ship, and left her more in Debt than she was before: She spoke this in a very good kind of a Manner, <HI>in her own Way,</HI> but which was very agreeable indeed, and had as much apparent Sincerity, and I verily believe as real as was possible to be express'd; but I put a Stop to it, and bid her say no more, but accept of what my
<PB N="264" REF="262"/>
Spouse had given her, which was but in Part, as she had heard him say; <HI>and put it up,</HI> says I, <HI>and come and sit down here, and give me Leave to say something else to you on the same Head, which my Spouse and I have settled between ourselves in your Behalf.</HI> What dost Thee mean, <HI>says she?</HI> and blush'd, and look'd surprized, but did not stir. She was going to speak again, but I inter∣rupted her, and told her she should make no more Apo∣logies of any kind whatever, for I had better Things than all this to talk to her of; so I went on, and told her, that as she had been so friendly and kind to us on every Occasion, and that her House was the lucky Place where we came together; and that she knew I was from her own Mouth acquainted in Part with her Circum∣stances, we were resolved she should be the better for us, so long as she lived. Then I told her what we had re∣solved to do for her; and that she had nothing more to do, but to consult with me, how it should be effectually secur'd for her, distinct from any of the Effects which were her Husband's; and that if her Husband did so sup∣ply her, that she could live comfortably, and not want it for Bread, or other Necessaries, she should not make Use of it, but lay up the Income of it, and add it every Year to the Principle, so to encrease the annual Pay∣ment, which in Time, and perhaps before she might come to want it, might double itself; that we were very willing whatever she should so lay up, should be to her∣self, and whoever she thought fit after her; but that the forty Pounds a Year, must return to our Family after her Life; which we both wish'd might be long and happy.</P>
<P>Let no Reader wonder at my extraordinary Concern for this poor Woman; or at my giving my Bounty to her a Place in this Account. It is not, <HI>I assure you,</HI> to to make a Pageantry of my Charity, or to value my∣self upon the Greatness of my Soul, that should give in so profuse a Manner as this, which was above my Fi∣gure, if my Wealth had been twice as much as it was; but there was another Spring from whence all flow'd, and 'tis on that Account I speak of it: Was it possible I
<PB N="265" REF="263"/>
could think of a poor desolate Woman with four Chil∣dren, and her Husband gone from her, <HI>and perhaps good for little if he had stay'd; I say,</HI> was I, that had tasted so deep of the Sorrows of such a kind of Widowhood, able to look on her, and think of her Circumstances, and not to be touched in an uncommon Manner? No, no, I never look'd on her and her Family, tho' she was not left so helpless and friendless as I had been, without remembering my own Condition, when <HI>Amy</HI> was sent out to pawn or sell my Pair of Stays to buy a Breast of Mutton, and a Bunch of Turnips; nor could I look on her poor Children, tho' not poor and perishing, like mine, without Tears; reflecting on the dreadful Condi∣tion that mine were reduc'd to, when poor <HI>Amy</HI> sent them all into their Aunt's in <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> and run away from them. These were the original Springs, or Foun∣tain-head, from whence my affectionate Thoughts were mov'd to assist this poor Woman.</P>
<P>When a poor Debtor, having lain long in the <HI>Compter,</HI> or <HI>Ludgate,</HI> or the <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> for Debt, afterwards gets out, rises again in the World, and grows rich; such an one is a certain Benefactor to the Prisoners there, and perhaps to every Prison he passes by, as long as he lives, for he remembers the dark Days of his own Sor∣row; and even those who never had the Experience of such Sorrows to stir up their Minds to Acts of Charity, would have the same charitable good Disposition, did they as sensibly remember what it is that distinguishes them from others by a more favourable and merciful Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I say,</HI> was however the Spring of my Concern for this honest, friendly and grateful QUAKER; and as I had so plentiful a Fortune in the World, I resolved she should taste the Fruit of her kind Usage to me, in a Manner that she could not expect.</P>
<P>All the while I talk'd to her, I saw the Disorder of her Mind; the sudden Joy was too much for her, and she coloured, trembled, chang'd, and at last grew pale, and was indeed near sainting; when she hastily rung a little Bell for her Maid, who coming in immediately, she
<PB N="266" REF="264"/>
beckon'd to her, <HI>for speak she could not,</HI> to fill her a Glass of Wine, but she had no Breath to take it in, and was almost choak'd with that which she took in her Mouth. I saw she was ill, and assisted her what I could, and with Spirits and Things to smell to, just kept her from fainting, when she beckon'd to her Maid to with∣draw, and immediately burst out in crying, and that re∣lieved her. When she recovered herself a little, she flew to me, and throwing her Arms about my Neck, O! <HI>says she, thou hast almost killed me;</HI> and there she hung, laying her Head in my Neck for half a Quarter of an Hour, not able to speak, but sobbing like a Child that had been whipp'd.</P>
<P>I was very sorry that I did not stop a little in the middle of my Discourse, and make her drink a Glass of Wine, before it had put her Spirits into such a violent Motion; but it was too late, and it was ten to one odds but that it had killed her.</P>
<P>But she came to herself at last, and began to say some very good Things in Return for my Kindness; I would not let her go on, but <HI>told her</HI> I had more to say to her still than all this, but that I would let it alone till an∣other Time; my Meaning was about the Box of Plate, good Part of which I gave her, and some I gave to <HI>A∣my,</HI> for I had so much Plate, and some so large, that I thought if I let my Husband see it, he might be apt to wonder what Occasion I could ever have for so much, and for Plate of such a kind too; as particularly, a great Cistern for Bottles, which cost a hundred and twenty Pounds, and some large Candlesticks, too big for any ordinary Use. These I caused <HI>Amy</HI> to sell; <HI>in short, Amy</HI> sold above three hundred Pounds-worth of Plate; what I gave the QUAKER, was worth above sixty Pounds, and I gave <HI>Amy</HI> above thirty Pounds-worth, and yet I had a great deal left for my Husband.</P>
<P>Nor did our Kindness to the QUAKER end with the forty Pounds a Year, for we were always, while we stayed with her, which was above ten Months, giving her one good Thing or another; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> in∣stead of lodging with her, she boarded with us, for I
<PB N="267" REF="265"/>
kept the House, and she and all her Family eat and drank with us, and yet we paid her the Rent of the House too; <HI>in short,</HI> I remembered <HI>my Widowhood,</HI> and I made this Widow's Heart glad many a Day the more upon that Account.</P>
<P>And now my Spouse and I began to think of going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where I had proposed to him to live, and in order to settle all the Preliminaries of our future Manner of Living, I began to draw in my Effects, so as to have them all at Command, upon whatever Occasion we thought fit; after which, one Morning I called my Spouse up to me; hark ye, Sir, <HI>said I to him,</HI> I have two very weighty Questions to ask of you; I do not know what Answer you will give to the first, but I doubt you will be able to give but a sorry Answer to the other, and yet, <HI>I assure you,</HI> it is of the last Importance to your∣self, and towards the future Part of your Life, where∣ever it is to be.</P>
<P>He did not seem to be much alarm'd, because he could see I was speaking in a kind of merry Way, <HI>Let's hear your Questions,</HI> my Dear, <HI>says he, and I'll give the best Answer I can to them.</HI> Why first, <HI>says I,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. You have married a Wife here, made her a Lady, and put her in Expectation of being something else still, when she comes abroad; pray have you ex∣amined whether you are able to supply all her extra∣vagant Demands when she comes abroad; and main∣tain an expensive <HI>Englishwoman</HI> in all her Pride and Vanity? <HI>In short,</HI> have you enquired whether you are able to keep her?</P>
<P N="2">II. You have married a Wife here, and given her a great many fine Things, and you maintain her like a Princess, and sometimes call her so; pray what Portion have you had with her? what Fortune has she been to you? and where does her Estate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, that you keep her so fine? I am afraid you keep her in a Figure a great deal above her Estate, at least, above all that you have seen of it yet? Are
<PB N="268" REF="266"/>
you sure you ha'n't got a Bite? and that you have not made a Beggar a Lady?</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says he,</HI> have you any more Questions to ask? let's have them all together, perhaps they may be all an∣swered in a few Words, as well as these two. No, <HI>says I,</HI> these are the two grand Questions, at least, for the present. Why then, <HI>says he,</HI> I'll answer you in a few Words, That I am fully Master of my own Circum∣stances, and without farther Enquiry, can let my Wife, you speak of, know, that as I have made her a Lady, I can maintain her as a Lady, wherever she goes with me; and this, whether I have one Pistole of her Portion, or whether she has any Portion or no: And as I have not enquired whether she has any Portion or not, so she shall not have the less Respect shewed her from me, or be obliged to live meaner, or be any Ways straitned on that Account; on the contrary, if she goes abroad to live with me in my own Country, I will make her more than a Lady, and support the Expence of it too, with∣out meddling with any Thing she has; and this I sup∣pose, <HI>says he,</HI> contains an Answer to both your Questi∣ons together.</P>
<P>He spoke this with a great deal more Earnestness in his Countenance, than I had when I proposed my Ques∣tions; and said a great many kind Things upon it, as the Consequence of former Discourses, so that I was obliged to be in earnest too. My Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> I was but in jest in my Questions; but they were proposed to introduce what I am going to say to you in earnest; <HI>namely,</HI> that if I am to go abroad, 'tis Time I should let you know how Things stand, and what I have to bring you with your Wife; how it is to be disposed and secured, <HI>and the like;</HI> and therefore come, <HI>says I,</HI> sit down, and let me shew you your Bargain here; I hope you will find that you have not got a Wife without a Fortune.</P>
<P>He told me then, that since he found I was in earnest, he desired that I would adjourn it till to morrow, and then we would do as the poor People do after they mar∣ry,
<PB N="269" REF="267"/>
feel in their Pockets, and see how much Money they can bring together in the World; well, <HI>says I,</HI> with all my Heart; and so we ended our Talk for that Time.</P>
<P>As this was in the Morning, my Spouse went out af∣ter Dinner to his Goldsmith's, <HI>as he said,</HI> and about three Hours after returns with a Porter and two large Boxes with him; and his Servant brought another Box, which I observed was almost as heavy as the two that the Porter brought, and made the poor Fellow sweat heartily; he dismiss'd the Porter, and in a little while after went out again with his Man, and returning at Night, brought another Porter with more Boxes and Bundles, and all was carried up, and put into a Chamber next to our Bed-chamber; and in the Morning he call'd for a pretty large round Table, and began to un∣pack.</P>
<P>When the Boxes were opened, I found they were chiefly full of Books, and Papers, and Parchments, <HI>I mean,</HI> Books of Accompts, and Writings, <HI>and such Things,</HI> as were in themselves of no Moment to me, be∣cause I understood them not; but I perceived he took them all out, and spread them about him upon the Ta∣ble and Chairs, and began to be very busy with them; so I withdrew and left him; and he was indeed so busy among them, that he never miss'd me, till I had been gone a good while; but when he had gone thro' all his Papers, and come to open a little Box, he called for me again; Now, <HI>says be,</HI> and called me <HI>his Countess,</HI> I am ready to answer your first Question; if you will sit down till I have opened this Box, we will see how it stands.</P>
<P>So we opened the Box; there was in it indeed what I did not expect, for I thought he had sunk his Estate ra∣ther than raised it; but he produced me in Goldsmiths Bills, and Stock in the <HI>English East-India-Company,</HI> a∣bout sixteen thousand Pounds Sterling; then he gave in∣to my Hands nine Assignments upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons in France,</HI> and two upon the Rents of the Town-house in <HI>Paris,</HI> amounting in the whole to 5800 Crowns <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="268"/>
<HI>Annum,</HI> or annual Rent, as 'tis called there; and lastly, the Sum of 30000 Rixdollars in the Bank of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> besides some Jewels and Gold in the Box, to the Value of about 15 or 1600 <HI>l.</HI> among which was a very good Necklace of Pearl, of about 200 <HI>l.</HI> Value; and that he pulled out, and tied about my Neck, telling me that should not be reckoned into the Account.</P>
<P>I was equally pleased and surprized, and it was with an inexpressible Joy that I saw him so rich. You might well tell me, <HI>said I,</HI> that you were able to make me a Countess, and maintain me as such: In short, he was immensely rich; for besides all this, he shewed me, which was the Reasons of his being so busy among the Books, <HI>I say,</HI> he shewed me several Adventures he had abroad, in the Business of his Merchandize; as particu∣larly, an eight Share in an <HI>East-India</HI> Ship then abroad; an Account-Courant with a Merchant at <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> lent upon <HI>Bottomree,</HI> upon Ships gone to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and a large Cargo of Goods in a Merchant's Hands for Sale at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal;</HI> so that in his Books there was about 12000 <HI>l.</HI> more; all which put together, made about 27000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>I stood amazed at this Account, as well I might, and said nothing to him for a good while, and the rather, because I saw him still busy looking over his Books. Af∣ter a while as I was going to express my Wonder; hold, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> this is not all neither; then he pull'd me out some old Seals, and small Parchment Rolls, which I did not understand; but he told me they were a Right of Reversion which he had to a paternal Estate in his Family, and a Mortgage of 14000 Rixdollars, which he had upon it, in the Hands of the present Pos∣sessor; so that was about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> more.</P>
<P>But now hold again, <HI>says he,</HI> for I must pay my Debts out of all this, and they are very great, I assure you; and the first, <HI>he said,</HI> was a black Article of 8000 Pis∣toles, which he had a Law-suit about at <HI>Paris,</HI> but had it awarded against him, which was the Loss he had told me of, and which made him leave <HI>Paris</HI> in Disgust;
<PB N="271" REF="269"/>
that in other Accounts he ow'd about 5300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; but after all this, upon the whole, he had still 17000 <HI>l.</HI> clear Stock in Money, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year in Rent.</P>
<P>After some Pause, it came to my Turn to speak. Well, <HI>says I,</HI> 'tis very hard a Gentleman with such a Fortune as this should come over to <HI>England,</HI> and marry a Wife with nothing; it shall never, <HI>says I,</HI> be said; but what I have, I'll bring into the public Stock; so I began to produce.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I pull'd out the Mortgage which good Sir <HI>Ro∣bert</HI> had procur'd for me, the annual Rent 700 <HI>l. per A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>num;</HI> the principle Money 14000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I pull'd out another Mortgage upon Land, procured by the same faithful Friend, which at three Times had advanced 12000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I pull'd him out a Parcel of little Securities, procur'd by several Hands, by Fee-farm Rents, and such petty Mortgages as those Times afforded, amount∣ing to 10800 <HI>l.</HI> principle Money, and paying six hun∣dred and thirty six Pounds a Year, so that in the whole there was 2056 <HI>l.</HI> a Year ready Money, constantly com∣ing in.</P>
<P>When I had shewn him all these, I laid them upon the Table, and bade him take them, that he might be able to give me an Answer to the <HI>second Question.</HI> viz. <HI>What Fortune he had with his Wife?</HI> and laugh'd a little at it.</P>
<P>He look'd at them a while, and then handed them all back again to me; I will not touch them, <HI>says he,</HI> nor one of them, till they are all settled in Trustees Hands, for your own Use, and the Management wholly your own.</P>
<P>I cannot omit what happened to me while all this was acting, tho' it was chearful Work in the Main, yet I tembled every Joint of me, worse for ought I know, than ever <HI>Belshazzer</HI> did at the Hand-writing on the Wall, and the Occasion was every Way as just. <HI>Un∣happy Wretch,</HI> said I to myself, <HI>shall my ill-got Wealth, the Product of</HI> prosperous Lust, <HI>and of a vile and vicious Life</HI> of Whoredom and Adultery, <HI>be intermingled with the honest well-gotten Estate of this innocent Gentleman,</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="270"/>
<HI>to be a Moth and a Catterpiller among it, and bring the Judgments of Heaven upon him, and upon what he has for my Sake! Shall my Wickedness blast his Comforts! Shall I</HI> be Fire in his Flax! <HI>and be a Means to provoke Heaven to cruse his Blessings!</HI> God forbid! <HI>I'll keep them a sunder, if it be possible.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true Reason why I have been so particular in the Account of my vast acquir'd Stock; and how his Estate, which was perhaps the Product of many Years fortunate Industry; and which was equal, if not supe∣rior, to mine, at best, was <HI>at my Request,</HI> kept apart from mine, <HI>as is mentioned above.</HI></P>
<P>I have told you how he gave back all my Writings into my own Hands again. Well. <HI>says I,</HI> seeing you will have it be kept apart, <HI>it shall be so,</HI> upon one Con∣dition, which I have to propose, and no other. And what is the Condition, <HI>says he?</HI> Why, <HI>says I,</HI> all the Pretence I can have for the making over my own Estate to me, is, that in Case of your Mortality, I may have it reserved for me, if I out-live you; well, <HI>says he,</HI> that is true. But then, <HI>said I,</HI> the annual Income is always re∣ceived by the Husband, during his Life, as 'tis suppos'd for the mutual Subsistance of the Family; now, <HI>says I,</HI> here is 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, which I believe is as much as we shall spend, and I desire none of it may be saved; and all the Income of your own Estate, the Interest of the 17000 <HI>l.</HI> and the 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year may be constantly laid by for the Encrease of your Estate; and so, <HI>added,</HI> I, by joining the Interest every Year to the Capital, you will perhaps grow as rich as you would do if you were to trade with it all, if you were obliged to keep House out of it too.</P>
<P>He lik'd the Proposal very well, and said it should be so; and this Way I, in some Measure, satisfied myself, that I should not bring my Husband under the Blast of a just Providence, for mingling my cursed ill-gotten Wealth with his honest Estate. This was occasioned by the Reflections which, at some certain Intervals of Time, came into my Thoughts of the Justice of Heaven, which I had Reason to expect would sometime or other still
<PB N="273" REF="271"/>
fall upon me or my Effects, for the dreadful Life I had liv'd.</P>
<P>And let no Body conclude from the strange Success I met with in all my wicked Doings, and the vast Estate which I had rais'd by it, that therefore I either was hap∣py or easy: No, no, there was a Dart struck into the Liver; there was a secret Hell within, even all the while, when our Joy was at the highest; but more es∣pecially now, after it was all over, and when accord∣ing to all Appearance, I was one of the happiest Wo∣men upon Earth, all this while, I say, I had such a constant Terror upon my Mind, as gave me every now and then very terrible Shocks, and which made me expect something very frightful upon every Accident of Life.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> it never Lightn'd or Thunder'd, but I ex∣pected the next Flash wou'd penetrate my Vitals, and melt the Sword <HI>[Soul]</HI> in this Scabbard of Flesh; it never blew a Storm of Wind, but I expected the Fall of some Stack of Chimneys, of some Part of the House wou'd bury me in its Ruins; and so of other Things.</P>
<P>But I shall perhaps, have Occasion to speak of all these Things again by and by; the Case before us was in a Manner settled; we had full four thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for our future Subsistance, besides a vast Sum in Jewels and Plate; and besides this, I had about eight thousand Pounds reserv'd in Money, which I kept back from him, to provide for my two Daughters, of whom I have yet much to say.</P>
<P>With this Estate, settl'd as you have heard, and with the best Husband in the World, I left <HI>England</HI> again; I had not only in human Prudence, and by the Na∣ture of the Thing, being now marry'd and settl'd in so glorious a Manner, I say, I had not only abandon'd all the gay and wicked Course which I had gone thro∣row before, but I began to look back upon it with that Horror, and that Detestation, which is the certain Companion, if not the Fore-runner, of Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="272"/>
Sometimes the Wonders of my present Circumstan∣ces wou'd work upon me, and I shou'd have some Rap∣tures upon my Soul, upon the Subject of my coming so smoothly out of the Arms of Hell, that I was not in∣gulph'd in Ruin, as most who lead such Lives are, first or last; but this was a Flight too high for me; I was not come to that Repentance that is rais'd from a Sense of Heaven's Goodness; I repented of the Crime, but it was of another and lower kind of Repentance, and rather mov'd by my Fears of Vengeance, than from a Sense of being spar'd from being punish'd, and landed safe after a Storm.</P>
<P>The first Thing which happened after our coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where we lodg'd for a while) was, that my Spouse saluted me one Morning with the Title of <HI>Countess,</HI> as he said he intended to do, by having the Inheritance to which the Honour was annex'd, made over to him. It is true, it was a Reversion, but it soon fell, and in the mean Time, as all the Brothers of a <HI>Count</HI> are call'd <HI>Counts,</HI> so I had the Title by Courtesy, about three Years before I had it in reallity.</P>
<P>I was agreeably surpriz'd at this coming so soon, and wou'd have had my Spouse have taken the Money which it cost him, out of my Stock, but he laughed at me, and went on.</P>
<P>I was now in the Height of my Glory and Prosperi∣ty, and I was call'd the <HI>Countess de—;</HI> for I had obtain'd that unlook'd for, which I secretly aim'd at, and was really the main Reason of my coming Abroad: I took now more Servants, liv'd in a kind of Magni∣ficence that I had not been acquainted with, was call'd <HI>Your Honour</HI> at every Word, and had a <HI>Coronet</HI> behind my Coach; tho' at the same Time I knew little or no∣thing of my new Pedigree.</P>
<P>The first Thing that my Spouse took upon him to manage, was to declare ourselves marry'd eleven Years before our arriving in <HI>Holland;</HI> and consequently to acknowledge our little Son, who was yet in <HI>England,</HI> to be legitimate; order him to be brought over, and
<PB N="275" REF="273"/>
added to his Family, and acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P>This was done by giving Notice to his People at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where his Children (which were two Sons and a Daughter) were brought up; that he was come over from <HI>England;</HI> and that he was arriv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> with his Wife, and shou'd reside there some Time; and that he wou'd have his two Sons brought down to see him, which accordingly was done, and where I entertain'd them with all the Kindness and Tenderness that they cou'd expect from their Mother-in-Law; and who pretended to be so ever since they were two or three Years old.</P>
<P>This, supposing us to have been so long marry'd, was not difficult at all, in a Country where we had been seen together about that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> eleven Years and a half before; and where we had never been seen afterwards, till we now return'd together; this being seen together, was also openly own'd, and acknow∣ledg'd of Course, by our Friend, the Merchant at <HI>Rot∣terdam;</HI> and also by the People in the House where we both lodg'd, in the same City, and where our first In∣timacies began, and who, as it happen'd, were all a∣live; and therefore to make it the more publick, we made a Tour to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> again, lodg'd in the same House, and was visited there by our Friend, the Mer∣chant; and afterwards invited frequently to his House, where he treated us very handsomely</P>
<P>This Conduct of my Spouse, and which he manag'd very cleverly, was indeed a Testimony of a wonder∣ful Degree of Honesty and Affection to our little Son; for it was done purely for the Sake of the Child.</P>
<P>I call it an honest Affection, because it was from a Principle of Honesty that he so earnestly concern'd him∣self, to prevent the Scandal which wou'd otherwise have fallen upon the Child, who was itself innocent; and as it was from this Principle of Justice that he so earnestly sollicited me, and conjur'd me by the natural Affections of a Mother, to marry him, when it was
<PB N="276" REF="274"/>
yet young within me, and unborn, that the Child might not suffer for the Sin of its Father and Mother; so tho' at the same Time, he really loved me very well, yet I had reason to believe, that it was from this Prin∣ciple of Justice to the Child, that he came to <HI>England</HI> again to seek me, with Design to marry me, and, as he call'd it, save the innocent Lamb from an Infamy worse than Death.</P>
<P>It is with a just Reproach to myself, that I must re∣peat it again, that I had not the same Concern for it, tho' it was the Child of my own Body; nor had I ever the hearty affectionate Love to the Child, that he had. What the Reason of it was, I cannot tell; and indeed, I had shown a general Neglect of the Child, thro' all the gay Years of my <HI>London</HI> Revels; except that I sent <HI>Amy</HI> to look upon it now and then, and to pay for its Nursing; as for me, I scarce saw it four Times in the first four Years of its Life, and often wish'd it wou'd go out of the World; whereas a Son which I had by the Jeweller, I took a different Care of, and shew'd a dif∣ferent Concern for, tho' I did not let him know me; for I provided very well for him, had him put out very well to School; and when he came to Years fit for it, let him go over with a Person of Honesty and good Business, to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and after he had liv'd there some Time, and began to act for himself, sent him over the Value of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> at several Times, with which he traded, and grew rich; and, as 'tis to be hop'd, may at last come over again with forty or fifty thousand Pounds in his Pocket, as many do who have not such Encouragement at their Beginning.</P>
<P>I also sent him over a Wife, a beautiful young La∣dy, well-bred, an exeeeding good natur'd pleasant Crea∣ture; but the nice young Fellow did not like her, and had the Impupence to write to me, <HI>that is, to the Person I employ'd to correspond with him,</HI> to send him another; and promis'd, that he wou'd marry her I had sent him to a Friend of his, who lik'd her better than he did; but I took it so ill, that I wou'd not send him another,

and withal, stopp'd another Article of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> which I had appointed to send him: He consider'd of it after∣wards, and offer'd to take her; but then truly she took so ill the first Affront he put upon her, that she wou'd not have him, and I sent him Word, I thought she was very much in the right: However, after courting her two Years, and some Friends interposing, she took him, and made him an excellent Wise, as I knew she wou'd; but I never sent him the thousand Pound Car∣goe, so that he lost that Money for misusing me, and took the Lady at last without it.</P>
<P>My new Spouse and I liv'd a very regular contem∣plative Life, and in itself certainly a Life fill'd with all human Felicity: But if I look'd upon my present Si∣tuation with Satisfaction, as I certainly did, so in Pro∣portion I on all Occasions look'd back on former Things with Detestation, and with the utmost Affliction; and now indeed, and not till now, those Reflections began to prey upon my Comforts, and lessen the Sweets of my other Enjoyments: They might be said to have gnaw'd a Hole in my Heart before; but now they made a Hole quite thro' it; now they eat into all my pleasant Things; made bitter every Sweet, and mix'd my Sighs with every Smile.</P>
<P>Not all the Affluence of a plentiful Fortune; not a hundred thousand Pounds Estate; (for between us we had litt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e less) not Honour and Titles, Attendants and Equipages; in a Word, not all the Things we call Pleasure, cou'd give me any relish, or sweeten the Taste of Things to me; at least, not so much, but I grew sad, heavy, pensive, and melancholy; slept little, and eat little; dream'd continually of the most frightful and terrible Things imaginable: Nothing but Apparitions of Devils and Monsters; falling into Gulphs, and off from steep and high Precipices, and the like; so that in the Morning, when I shou'd rise, and be refresh'd with the Blessing of Rest, I was Hagridden with Frights, and terrible Things, form'd meerly in the Imagination; and was either tir'd, and wanted Sleep, or over-run
<PB N="278" REF="276"/>
with Vapours, and not fit for conversing with my Fa∣mily, or any one else.</P>
<P>My Husband, the tenderest Creature in the World, and particularly so to me, was in great Concern for me, and did every Thing that lay in his Power, to comfort and restore me; strove to reason me out of it; then tried all the Ways possible to divert me; but it was all to no purpose, or to but very little.</P>
<P>My only Relief was, sometimes to unbosom myself to poor <HI>Amy,</HI> when she and I were alone; and she did all she cou'd to comfort me, but all was to little Effect there; for tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was the better Penitent before, when we had been in the Storm; <HI>Amy</HI> was just where she us'd to be, <HI>now,</HI> a wild, gay, loose Wretch, and not much the graver for her Age; for <HI>Amy</HI> was between forty and fifty by this Time too.</P>
<P>But to go on with my own Story; as I had no Com∣forter, so I had no Counsellor; it was well, as I often thought, that I was not a <HI>Roman Catholick;</HI> for what a Piece of Work shou'd I have made, to have gone to a Priest with such an History as I had to tell him? and what Pennance wou'd any <HI>Father-Confessor</HI> have oblig'd me to perform? especially if he had been honest and true to his Office.</P>
<P>However, as I had none of the recourse, so I had none of the Absolution, by which the Criminal con∣fessing, goes away comforted; but I went about with a Heart loaded with Crime, and altogether in the dark, as to what I was to do; and in this Con∣dition I languish'd near two Years; I may well call it languishing, for if Providence had not reliev'd me, I shou'd have died in little Time: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I must now go back to another Scene, and join it to this End of my Story, which will compleat all my Con∣cern with <HI>England,</HI> at least, all that I shall bring into this Account. I have hinted at large, what I had done for my two Sons, one at <HI>Messina,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="277"/>
But I have not gone thorow the Story of my two Daughters: I was so in Danger of being known by one of them, that I durst not see her, so as to let her know who I was; and for the other, I cou'd not well know how to see her, and own her, and let her see me, be∣cause she must then know that I wou'd not let her Sister know me, which wou'd look strange; so that upon the whole, I resolv'd to see neither of them at all, but <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd all that for me; and when she had made Gentlewomen of them both, by giving them a good tho' late Education, she had like to have blown up the whole Case, and herself and me too, by an unhappy Discovery of herself to the last of them, that is, to her who was our Cookmaid, and who, as I said before, <HI>Amy</HI> had been oblig'd to turn away, for fear of the very Discovery which now happen'd: I have observ'd al∣ready in what Manner <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd her by a third Per∣son; and how the Girl, when she was set up for a La∣dy as above, came and visited <HI>Amy</HI> at my Lodgings; after which, <HI>Amy</HI> going, as was her Custom, to see the Girl's Brother (my Son) at the honest Man's House in <HI>Spittle Fields;</HI> both the Girls were there, meerly by accident, at the same Time, and the other Girl una∣wares discover'd the Secret, <HI>namely,</HI> that this was the Lady that had done all this for them.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was greatly surpriz'd at it, but as she saw there was no Remedy, she made a Jest of it; and so after that, convers'd openly, being still satisfied that neither of them cou'd make much of it, as long as they knew nothing of me: So she took them together one Time, and told them the History, as she call'd it, of their Mother; beginning at the miserable carrying them to their Aunt's; she own'd she was not their Mother herself, but describ'd her to them: However, when she said she was not their Mother, one of them express'd herself very much surpriz'd, for the Girl had taken up a strong Fancy that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother; and that she had for some particular Reasons, conceal'd it from her, and therefore when she told her frankly that she was not
<PB N="280" REF="278"/>
her Mother, the Girl fell a crying, and <HI>Amy</HI> had much ado to keep Life in her: This was the Girl who was at first my Cookmaid in the <HI>Pallmall.</HI> When <HI>Amy</HI> had brought her to again a little, and she had recover'd her first Disorder, <HI>Amy</HI> ask'd what ail'd her? the poor Girl hung about her, and kiss'd her, and was in such a Passion still, tho' she was a great Wench of nineteen or twenty Years old, that she cou'd not be brought to speak a great while; at last, having recover'd her Speech, she said still, <HI>But O do not say you a'n't my Mo∣ther! I'm sure you are my Mother;</HI> and then the Girl cry'd again like to kill herself: <HI>Amy</HI> could not tell what to do with her a good while; she was loth to say again, she was not her Mother, because she wou'd not throw her into a Fit of crying again; but she went round about a little with her: Why Child, says she, why wou'd you have me be your Mother? If it be because I am so kind to you, be easy, my Dear, says <HI>Amy,</HI> I'il be as kind to you still, as if I was your Mother.</P>
<P>Ay but, says the Girl, I am sure you are my Mother too; and what have I done that you won't own me, and that you will not be call'd my Mother? tho' I am poor, you have made me a Gentlewoman, says she, and I won't do any Thing to disgrace you; besides, adds she, I can keep a Secret too, especially for my own Mother, sure; then she calls <HI>Amy</HI> her Dear Mo∣ther, and hung about her Neck again, crying still vehemently.</P>
<P>This last Part of the Girl's Words alarm'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and, as she told me, frighted her terrible; nay, she was so consounded with it, that she was not able to govern herself, or to conceal her Disorder from the Girl her∣self, <HI>as you shall hear: Amy</HI> was at a full Stop, and confus'd to the last Degree; and the Girl a sharp Jade, turn'd it upon her: My Dear Mother, says she, do not be uneasy about it; I know it all; but do not be uneasy, I won't let my Sister know a Word of it, or my Bro∣ther either, without you give me leave, but don't dis∣own me now you have found me; don't hide yourself
<PB N="281" REF="279"/>
from me any longer; I can't bear that, says she, it will break my Heart.</P>
<P>I think the Girl's mad, <HI>says Amy,</HI> why Child, I tell thee, if I was thy Mother I wou'd not disown thee; don't you see I am as kind to you as if I was your Mo∣ther? <HI>Amy</HI> might as well have sung a Song to a Kettle-Drum, as talk to her: Yes, says the Girl, you are ve∣ry good to me indeed; and that was enough to make any Body believe she was her Mother too; but however, that was not the Case, she had other Reasons to believe, and to know that she was her Mother, and it was a sad Thing she wou'd not let her call her Mother, who was her own Child.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so Heart-full with the Disturbance of it, that she did not enter farther with her into the Enquiry, as she wou'd otherwise have done, I mean, as to what made the Girl so positive, but comes away, and tells me the whole Story.</P>
<P>I was Thunder struck with the Story at first, and much more afterwards, <HI>as you shall hear;</HI> but, I say, I was Thunder-struck at first, and amaz'd, and said to <HI>Amy,</HI> There must be something or other in it more than we know of; but having examin'd farther into it, I found the Girl had no Notion of any Body, but of <HI>Amy,</HI> and glad I was that I was not concern'd in the Pretence, and that the Girl had no Notion of me in it: But even this Easiness did not continue long, for the next Time <HI>Amy</HI> went to see her, she was the same Thing, and ra∣ther more violent with <HI>Amy</HI> than she was before: <HI>Amy</HI> endeavour'd to pacify her by all the Ways imaginable; <HI>first,</HI> she told her, she took it ill that she wou'd not be∣lieve her; and told her, if she wou'd not give over such a foolish Whimsy, she wou'd leave her to the wide World, as she found her.</P>
<P>This put the Girl into Fits, and she cry'd ready to kill herself, and hung about <HI>Amy</HI> again, like a Child: Why, <HI>says Amy,</HI> why can you not be easy with me then, and compose yourself, and let me go on to do you good, and show you Kindness, as I wou'd do, and as I intend to do? Can you think that if I was your Mother, I
<PB N="282" REF="280"/>
would not tell you so? What Whimsy is this that pos∣sesses your Mind? <HI>says Amy:</HI> Well, the Girl told her in a few Words, but those few such as frighted <HI>Amy</HI> out of her Wits, and me too: That she knew well enough how it was; I know says she, when you left—, <HI>naming the Village,</HI> where I liv'd when my Father went away from us all, that you went over to <HI>France,</HI> I know that too, and who you went with, <HI>says the Girl;</HI> did not my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> come back again with you? I know it all well enough, tho' I was but a Child, I have heard it all.—And thus she run on with such Dis∣course, as put <HI>Amy</HI> out of all Temper again; and she rav'd at her like a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and told her, she wou'd never come near her any more; she might go a begging again if she wou'd; she'd have nothing to do with her: The Girl, a passionate Wench, <HI>told her,</HI> she knew the worst of it, she cou'd go to Service again, and if she wou'd not own her own Child, she must do as she pleased: then she fell into a Passion of crying again, as if she wou'd kill herself.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> this Girl's Conduct terrify'd <HI>Amy</HI> to the last Degree, and me too, and was it not that we knew the Girl was quite wrong in some Things, she was yet so right in some other, that it gave me a great deal of Per∣plexity; but that which put <HI>Amy</HI> the most to it, was, that the Girl <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> told her, that she, <HI>(mean∣ing me her Mother)</HI> had gone away with the <HI>Jeweller,</HI> and into <HI>France</HI> too; she did not call him <HI>the Jeweller,</HI> but with the Landlord of the House; who, after her Mother fell into Distress, and that <HI>Amy</HI> had taken all the Children from her, made much of her, and after∣wards marry'd her.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> it was plain the Girl had but a broken Ac∣count of things, but yet, that she had receiv'd some Ac∣counts that had a Reallity in the Bottom of them; so that it seems our first Measures, and the Amour with the <HI>Jew∣eller,</HI> were not so conceal'd as I thought they had been; and it seems came in a broken Manner to my Sister in Law, who <HI>Amy</HI> carry'd the Children to, and she made some Bustle, it seems, about it; but as good Luck was,
<PB N="283" REF="281"/>
it was too late, and I was remov'd, and gone, none knew whither; or else she wou'd have sent all the Chil∣dren home to me again, to be sure.</P>
<P>This we pick'd out of the Girl's Discourse, that is to say, <HI>Amy</HI> did at several Times; but it all consisted of broken Fragments of Stories, such as the Girl herself had heard so long ago, that she herself cou'd make very little of it; only that in the Main, that her Mother had play'd the Whore; had gone away with the Gentleman that was Landlord of the House; that he married her; that she went into <HI>France.</HI> And as she had learn'd in my Family, where she was a Servant, that Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and her Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had been in <HI>France</HI> together; so she put all these Things together, and joining them with the great Kindness that <HI>Amy</HI> now shew'd her, possess'd the Creature that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother; nor was it possible for <HI>Amy</HI> to conquer it for a long Time.</P>
<P>But this, after I had search'd into it as far as by <HI>Amy's</HI> Relation. I cou'd get an Account of it, did not disquiet me half so much, as that the young Slut had got the Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> by the end; and that she knew who her Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was, and the like; tho' this neither, did not hang together, for then she wou'd not have fix'd upon <HI>Amy</HI> for her Mother: But some Time after, when <HI>Amy</HI> had almost perswaded her out of it, and that the Girl began to be so confounded in her Discou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that they made neither Head nor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an; at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sionate Creature flew out in a kind of Rage, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to</HI> Amy, That if she was not her Mother, Mad <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>∣ana</HI> was her Mother then, for one of them, <HI>si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was sure,</HI> was her Mother; and then all this that <HI>Amy</HI> had done for her, was by Madam <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Order, and I am sure, says she, it was my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Coach that brought the Gentlwoman (whoever it was) to my Un∣cle's in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> for the Coachman told me so: <HI>Amy</HI> fell a laughing at her aloud, <HI>as was her usual Way,</HI> but as <HI>Amy</HI> told me, it was but on one side of her Mouch; for she was so confounded at her Discourse, that she was ready to sink into the Ground; and so was I too, when she told it me.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="282"/>
However, <HI>Amy</HI> brazened her out of it all; <HI>told her,</HI> Well, since you think you are so high born, as to be my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Daughter, you may go to her and claim your Kindred, can't you? I suppose, <HI>says</HI> Amy, you know where to find her? <HI>She said,</HI> she did not ques∣tion to find her, for she knew where she was gone to live privately; but tho' she might be removed again, for I know how it is, <HI>says she,</HI> with a kind of a Smile or a Grin; I know how it all is, well enough.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was so provok'd that she told me, <HI>in short,</HI> she began to think it would be absolutely necessary to mur∣ther her. That Expression fill'd me with Horror, all my Blood ran chill in my Veins, and a Fit of Trembling seized me, that I could not speak a good while; at last, What is the Devil in you, <HI>Amy? said I,</HI> Nay, nay, <HI>says she,</HI> let it be the Devil or not the Devil, if I thought she knew one Tittle of your History, I would dispatch her if she were my own Daughter a thousand Times; and I, <HI>says I in a Rage,</HI> as well as I love you, would be the first that should put the Halter about your Neck, and see you hang'd with more Satisfaction than ever I saw you in my Life; nay, <HI>says I,</HI> you would not live to be hang'd, <HI>I believe,</HI> I should cut your Throat with my own Hand; I am ready to do it, <HI>said I,</HI> as 'tis, for your but naming the Thing; with that, I called her cursed Devil, and bid her get out of the Room.</P>
<P>I think it was the first Time that ever I was angry with <HI>Amy</HI> in all my Life; and when all was done, tho' she was a devilish Jade in having such a Thought, yet it was all of it the Effect of her Excess of Affection and Fidelity to me.</P>
<P>But this Thing gave me a terrible Shock, for it hap∣pened just after I was married, and serv'd to hasten my going over to <HI>Holland;</HI> for I would not have been seen, so as to be known by the Name of <HI>Roxana,</HI> no, not for ten thousand Pounds; it would have been enough to have ruined me to all Intents and Purposes with my Hus∣band, and every Body else too; I might as well have been the <HI>German</HI> Princess.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="283"/>
Well, I set <HI>Amy</HI> to work; and give <HI>Amy</HI> her due. she set all her Wits to work, to find out which Way this Girl had her Knowledge; but more particularly, how much Knowledge she had, <HI>that is to say,</HI> what she really knew, and what she did not know, for this was the main Thing with me; how she should say she knew who Madam <HI>Roxana</HI> was, and what Notions she had of that Affair was very mysterious to me; for 'twas cer∣tain she could not have a right Notion of me, because she would have it be that <HI>Amy</HI> was her Mother.</P>
<P>I scolded heartily at <HI>Amy,</HI> for letting the Girl ever know her, <HI>that is to say,</HI> know her in this Affair; for that she knew her could not be hid, because she, <HI>as I might say,</HI> served <HI>Amy,</HI> or rather under <HI>Amy</HI> in my Fa∣mily, <HI>as is said before;</HI> but she <HI>(Amy)</HI> talk'd with her at first by another Person, and not by herself; and that Secret came out by an Accident, <HI>as I have said above.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was concerned at it as well as I, but could not help it; and tho' it gave us great Uneasiness, yet as there was no Remedy, we were bound to make as little Noise of it as we could, that it might go no farther. I bid <HI>Amy</HI> punish the Girl for it, <HI>and she did so,</HI> for she parted with her in a Huff, and told her she should see she was not her Mother, for that she could leave her just where she found her; and seeing she could not be con∣tent to be served by the Kindness of a Friend, but that she would needs make a Mother of her, she would, for the Future, be neither Mother nor Friend; and so bid her go to Service again, and be a Drudge, as she was before.</P>
<P>The poor Girl cry'd most lamentably, but would not be beaten out of it still; but that which dum-founded <HI>A∣my</HI> more than all the rest, was, that when she had rated the poor Girl a long Time, and could not beat her out of it, and had, <HI>as I have observed,</HI> threatned to leave her, the Girl kept to what she had said before, and put this Turn to it again; that she was sure, if <HI>A∣my</HI> wa'n't, my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was, her Mother, and that she would go find her out; <HI>adding,</HI> that she made
<PB N="286" REF="284"/>
no Doubt but that she could do it, for she knew where to enquire the Name of her new Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> came Home with this Piece of News in her Mouth to me. I could easily perceive when she came in that she was mad in her Mind, and in a Rage at some∣thing or other, and was in great Pain to get it out; for when she came first in my Husband was in the Room. However, <HI>Amy</HI> going up to undress her, I soon made an Excuse to follow her, and coming into the Room; what the D—l is the Matter, <HI>Amy? says I,</HI> I am sure you have some bad News. News, <HI>says Amy, aloud,</HI> ay, so I have; I think the D—l is in that young Wench, she will ruin us all, and herself too, there is no quieting her: So she went on and told me all the Particulars; but sure nothing was so astonished as I was, when she told me that the Girl knew I was married, that she knew my Husband's Name, and would endeavour to find me out. I thought I should have sunk down at the very Words. In the middle of all my Amazement, <HI>Amy</HI> starts up, and runs about the Room like a distracted Bo∣dy, I'll put an End to it, that I will, I cannot bear it, I must murther her, I'll kill her B—, <HI>and swears by her Maker in the most serious Tone in the World;</HI> and then repeated it over three or four Times, walking to and again in the Room; I will, in short, I will kill her, if there was not another Wench in the World.</P>
<P>Prithee hold thy Tongue, <HI>Amy, says I,</HI> why thou art mad; ay, so I am, <HI>says she,</HI> stark-mad, but I'll be the Death of her for all that, and then I shall be sober a∣gain. But you shan't, <HI>says I,</HI> you shan't hurt a Hair of her Head; why you ought to be hanged for what you have done already; for having resolved on it, is doing it, as to the Guilt of the Fact; you are a Murtherer already, as much as if you had done it already.</P>
<P>I know that, <HI>says Amy,</HI> and it can be no worse; I'll put you out of your Pain, and her too, she shall never challenge you for her Mother in this World, whatever she may in the next. Well, well, <HI>says I,</HI> be quiet, and do not talk thus, I can't bear it; so she grew a little soberer after a while.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="285"/>
I must acknowledge the Notion of being discovered carried with it so many frightful Ideas, and hurried my Thoughts so much, that I was scare myself, any more than <HI>Amy,</HI> so dreadful a Thing is a Load of Guilt upon the Mind.</P>
<P>And yet when <HI>Amy</HI> began the second Time, to talk thus abominably of killing the poor Child, of murther∣ing her, and swore by her Maker that she would, so that I began to see that she was in earnest, I was far∣ther terrify'd a great deal, and it help'd to bring me to myself again in other Cases.</P>
<P>We laid our Head together then, to see if it was pos∣sible to discover by what Means she had learned to talk so, and how she <HI>(I mean my Girl)</HI> came to know that her Mother had married a Husband; but it would not do, the Girl would acknowledge nothing, and gave but a very imperfect Account of Things still, being disgust∣ed to the last Degree with <HI>Amy</HI>'s leaving her so abruptly as she did.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> went to the House where the Boy was, but it was all one; there they had only heard a confus'd Story of the Lady <HI>somebody,</HI> they knew not who, which this same Wench had told them, but they gave no Heed to it at all. <HI>Amy</HI> told them how foolishly the Girl had acted, and how she had carried on the Whimsy so far, in Spight of all they could say to her; that she had tak∣en it so ill, she would see her no more, and so she might e'en go to Service again if she would, for she <HI>(Amy)</HI> would have nothing to do with her, unless she humbled herself, and changed her Note, and that quickly too.</P>
<P>The good old Gentleman, who had been the Bene∣factor to them all, was greatly concerned at it, and the good Woman his Wife was grieved beyond all expres∣sing, and begg'd her Ladyship, <HI>meaning</HI> Amy, not to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent it; they promised too they would talk with her about it; and the old Gentlewoman added, <HI>with some Astonishment,</HI> sure she cannot be such a Fool but she will be prevailed with to hold her Tongue, when she has it from your own Mouth that you are not her Mother, and sees that it disobliges your Ladyship to have her insist
<PB N="288" REF="286"/>
uqon it; and so <HI>Amy</HI> came away with some Expectation that it would be stopped here.</P>
<P>But the Girl was such a Fool for all that, and persist∣ed in it obstinately, notwithstanding all they could say to her; nay, her Sister begg'd and intreated her not to play the Fool, for that it would ruin her too; and that the Lady <HI>(meaning</HI> Amy) would abandon them both.</P>
<P>Well, notwithstanding this, she insisted, <HI>I say,</HI> upon it, and which was worse, the longer it lasted, the more she began to drop <HI>Amy</HI>'s Ladyship, and would have it that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mother, and that she had made some Enquiries about it, and did not doubt but she should find her out.</P>
<P>When it was come to this, and we found there was nothing to be done with the Girl, but that she was so obstinately bent upon the Search after me, that she ven∣tur'd to forfeit all she had in View; <HI>I say,</HI> when I found it was come to this, I began to be more serious in my Preparations of my going beyond Sea; and particularly, it gave me some Reason to fear that there was something in it; but the following Accident put me beside all my Measures, and struck me into the greatest Confusion that ever I was in, in my Life.</P>
<P>I was so near going abroad, that my Spouse and I had taken Measures for our going off; and because I would be sure not to go too public, but so as to take a∣way all Possibility of being seen, I had made some Ex∣ception to my Spouse against goint in the ordinary pub∣lic Passage-Boats. My Pretence to him, was, the pro∣miscuous Crowds in those Vessels, want of Convenience, <HI>and the like;</HI> so he took the Hint, and found me out an <HI>English</HI> Merchant-Ship, which was bound for <HI>Rotter∣dam,</HI> and getting soon acquainted with the Master, he hired his whole Ship, <HI>that is to say,</HI> his Great-Cabbin, for I do not mean his Ship for Freight. So that we had all the Conveniencies possible for our Passage; and all Things being near ready, he brought Home the Cap∣tain one Day to Dinner with him, that I might see him, and be acquainted a little with him; so we came, after Dinner, to talk of the Ship, and the Conveniencies on
<PB N="289" REF="287"/>
Board, and the Captain press'd me earnestly to come on Board, and see the Ship, intimating, that he would treat us as well as he could; and in Discourse I happened to say, I hop'd he had no other Passengers; <HI>he said,</HI> No, he had not; but, <HI>he said,</HI> his Wife had courted him a good while to let her go over to <HI>Holland</HI> with him, for he always us'd that Trade, but he never could think of venturing all he had in one Bottom; but if I went with him, he thought to take her and her Kinswoman along with him this Voyage, that they might both wait upon me; <HI>and so added,</HI> that if we would do him the Ho∣nour to dine on Board the next Day, he would bring his Wife on Board, the better to make us welcome.</P>
<P>Who could have believed the Devil had any Snare at the Bottom of all this? or that I was in any Danger on such an Occasion, so remote and out of the Way as this was? But the Event was the oddest that could be thought of: As it happened, <HI>Amy</HI> was not at Home when we ac∣cepted this Invitation, and so she was left out of the Company; but instead of <HI>Amy,</HI> we took our honest, good-humoured, never-to-be-omitted Friend the QUAK∣ER, one of the best Creatures that ever liv'd, sure; and who, besides a thousand good Qualities unmix'd with one bad one, was particularly excellent for being the best Company in the World; tho' I think I had carried <HI>Amy</HI> too, if she had not been engaged in this unhappy Girl's Affair; for on a sudden the Girl was lost, and no News was to be heard of her, and <HI>Amy</HI> had hunted her to every Place she could think of, that it was likely to find her in, but all the News she could hear of her, was, That she was gone to an old Comrade's House of hers, whom she call'd Sister, and who was married to a Mas∣ter of a Ship at <HI>Redriff,</HI> and even this the Jade never told me. It seems when this Girl was directed by <HI>Amy</HI> to get her some Breeding, go to the Boarding-School, <HI>and the like,</HI> she was recommended to a Boarding-School at <HI>Camberwell,</HI> and there she contracted an Acquaint∣ance with a young Lady <HI>(so they are all called)</HI> her Bed∣fellow, that they called Sisters, and promised never to break off their Acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="288"/>
But judge you what an unaccountable Surprize I must be in when I came on Board the Ship, and was brought into the Captain's Cabbin, or, <HI>what they call it,</HI> the Great-Cabbin of the Ship, to see his Lady or Wife, and another young Person with her, who, when I came to see her near-hand, was my old Cook-maid in the <HI>Pall∣mall,</HI> and as appeared by the Sequel of the Story, was neither more or less than my own Daughter; that I knew her was out of Doubt; for tho' she had not had Oppor∣tunity to see me very often, yet I had often seen her, <HI>as I must needs,</HI> being in my own Family so long.</P>
<P>If ever I had need of Courage, and a full Presence of Mind, it was now; it was the only valuable Secret in the World to me, all depended upon this Occasion; if the Girl knew me, I was undone; and to discover any Surprize or Disorder, had been to make her know me, or guess it, and discover herself.</P>
<P>I was once going to feign a swooning and fainting a∣way, and so falling on the Ground, or Floor, put them all into a Hurry and Fright, and by that Means get an Opportunity to be continually holding something to my Nose to smell to, and so hold my Hand or my Hand∣kerchief, or both, before my Mouth; then pretend I could not bear the Smell of the Ship, or the Closeness of the Cabbin; but that would have been only to re∣move into a clearer Air upon the Quarter-deck, where we should with it, have had a clearer Light too; and if I had pretended the Smell of the Ship, it would have served only to have carried us all on Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to the Captain's House, which was hard by; for the Ship lay so close to the Shore, that we only walked over a Plank to go on Board, and over another Ship which lay with∣in her; so this not appearing seasible, and the Thought not being two Minutes old, there was no Time; for the two Ladies rose up, and we saluted, so that I was bound to come so near <HI>my Girl,</HI> as to kiss her, which I would not have done, had it been possible to have avoided it; but there was no Room to escape.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="289"/>
I cannot but take Notice here, that notwithstanding there was a secret Horror upon my Mind, and I was ready to sink when I came close to her to salute her; yet it was a secret inconceivable Pleasure to me when I kiss'd her, to know that I kiss'd my own Child, my own Flesh and Blood, born of my Body, and who I had never kiss'd since I took the fatal Farewel of them all, with a Million of Tears, and a Heart almost dead with Grief, when <HI>Amy</HI> and the good Woman took them all away, and went with them to <HI>Spittle fields.</HI> No Pen can describe, no Words can express, <HI>I say,</HI> the strange Impression which this Thing made upon my Spirits, I felt something shoot thro' my Blood, my Heart fluttered, my Head flash'd, and was dizzy, and all within me, <HI>as I thought,</HI> turned about, and much ado I had not to abandon myself to an Excess of Passion at the first Sight of her, much more when my Lips touched her Face; I thought I must have taken her in my Arms, and kiss'd her again a thousand Times, whether I would or no.</P>
<P>But I rouz'd up my Judgment, and shook it off, and with infinite Uneasiness in my Mind I sat down: You will not wonder, if upon this Surprize I was not con∣versible for some Minutes, and that the Disorder had al∣most discovered itself. I had a Complication of severe Things upon me, I could not conceal my Disorder with∣out the utmost Difficulty, and yet upon my concealing it depended the whole of my Prosperity, so I used all Manner of Violence with my self to prevent the Mischief which was at the Door.</P>
<P>Well, I saluted her; but as I went first forward to the Captain's Lady, who was at the farther End of the Cabbin, towards the Light, I had the Occasion offered to stand with my Back to the Light, when I turned a∣bout to her, who stood more on my Left-hand, so that she had not a fair Sight of me, tho' I was so near her. I trembled, and knew neither what I did or said, I was in the utmost Extremity, between so many particular Circumstances as lay upon me, for I was to conceal my Disorder from every Body, at the utmost Peril, and at the same Time expected every Body would discern it;
<PB N="292" REF="290"/>
I was to expect she would discover that she knew me; and yet was, by all Means possible, to prevent it. I was to conceal myself, if possible, and yet had not the least Room to do any Thing towards it; <HI>in short,</HI> there was no Retreat, no shifting any Thing off, no avoiding or preventing her having a full Sight of me, nor was there any counterfeiting my Voice, for then my Husband would have perceived it; <HI>in short,</HI> there was not the least Circumstance that offered me any Assistance, or any favourable Thing to help me in this Exigence.</P>
<P>After I had been upon the Rack for near half an Hour, during which I appeared stiff and reserved, and a little too formal, my Spouse and the Captain fell into Dis∣courses about the Ship and the Sea, and Business remote from us Women; and by and by the Captain carried him out upon the Quarter-deck, and left us all by our∣selves in the Great-Cabbin: Then we began to be a little freer one with another, and I began to be a little re∣viv'd by a sudden Fancy of my own, <HI>namely,</HI> I thought I perceived that the Girl did not know me; and the chief Reason of my having such a Notion, was, because I did not perceive the least Disorder in her Countenance, or the least Change in her Carriage, no Confusion no He∣sitation in her Discourse; <HI>nor,</HI> which I had my Eye par∣ticularly upon, did I observe that she fix'd her Eyes much upon me, <HI>that is to say,</HI> not singling me out to look steddily at me, as I thought would have been the Case; but that she rather singled out my Friend the QUAKER, and chatted with her on several Things; but I observed too, that it was all about indifferent Matters.</P>
<P>This greatly encouraged me, and I began to be a little chearful; but I was knock'd down again as with a Thunder-Clap, when turning to the Captain's Wife, and discoursing of me, <HI>she said to her,</HI> Sister, I cannot but think <HI>(my Lady)</HI> to be very much like such a Person, <HI>then she nam'd the Person;</HI> and the Captain's Wife said, <HI>she thought so too;</HI> the Girl replied again, <HI>she was sure she had seen me before, but she could not recollect where;</HI> I answered, (tho' her Speech was not directed to me)
<PB N="293" REF="291"/>
<HI>That I fancy'd she had not seen me before in</HI> England, but ask'd if she had lived in <HI>Holland,</HI> She said, <HI>No, no, she had never been out of</HI> England; and I added, <HI>That she could not then have known me in</HI> England, <HI>unless it was very lately, for I had liv'd at</HI> Rotterdam <HI>a great while.</HI> This carried me out of that Part of the Broil, pretty well; and to make it go off the better, when a little <HI>Dutch</HI> Boy came into the Cabbin, who belong'd to the Captain, and who I easily perceiv'd to be <HI>Dutch,</HI> I jested, and talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> to him, and was merry about the Boy, <HI>that is to say,</HI> as merry as the Consternation I was still in would let me be.</P>
<P>However, I began to be thorowly convinced by this Time, that the Girl did not know me, which was an insinite Satisfaction to me; or, <HI>at least,</HI> that tho' she had some Notion of me, yet that she did not think any Thing about my being who I was, and which perhaps, she would have been as glad to have known, as I would have been surpriz'd if she had; indeed it was evident that had she suspected any Thing of the Truth, she would not have been able to have conceal'd it.</P>
<P>Thus this Meeting went off, and, <HI>you may be sure,</HI> I was resolved, if once I got off of it, she should never see me again, to revive her Fancy; but I was mistaken there too, <HI>as you shall hear.</HI> After we had been on Board, the Captain's Lady carried us Home to her House, which was but just on Shore, and treated us there again very handsomely, and made us promise that we would come again and see her before we went, to concert our Af∣fairs for the Voyage, <HI>and the like;</HI> for she assured ns, that both she and her Sister went the Voyage at that Time, for our Company; and I thought to myself, <HI>Then you'll never go the Voyage at all;</HI> for I saw from that Moment, that it would be no Way convenient for <HI>my Ladyship</HI> to go with them; for that frequent Con∣versation might bring me to her Mind, and she would certainly claim her Kindred to me in a few Days, as in∣deed would have been the Case.</P>
<P>It is hardly possible for me to conceive what would have been our Part in this Affair, had my Woman <HI>Amy</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="292"/>
gone with me on Board this Ship, it had certainly blown up the whole Affair, and I must for ever after have been this Girl's Vassal, <HI>that is to say,</HI> have let her into the Secret, and trusted to her keeping it too, or have been exposed and undone. <HI>The very Thought filled me with Horror.</HI></P>
<P>But I was not so unhappy neither, as it sell out, for <HI>Amy</HI> was not with us, and that was my Deliverance in∣deed; yet we had another Chance to get over soill. As I resolved to put off the Voyage, so I resolved to put off the Visit, <HI>you may be sure;</HI> going upon this Principle <HI>namely,</HI> that I was fix'd in it, that the Girl had seen her last of me, and should never see me more.</P>
<P>However, to bring myself well off, and withal to see (if I could) a little farther into the Matter, I sent my Friend the QUAKER, to the Captain's Lady, to make the Visit promised, and to make my Excuse that I could not possibly wait on her, for that I was very much out of Order; and in the End of the Discourse, I bade her insinuate to them, that she was afraid I should not be able to get ready to go the Voyage, so soon as the Cap∣tain would be obliged to go; and that perhaps we might put it off to his next Voyage: I did not let the QUAKER into any other Reason for it, than that I was indisposed; and not knowing what other Face to put upon that Part, I made her believe that I thought I was a breed∣ing.</P>
<P>It was easy to put that into her Head, and she of Course hinted to the Captain's Lady, that she found me so very ill, that she was afraid I would miscarry, and then, <HI>to be sure,</HI> I could not think of going.</P>
<P>She went, and she manag'd that Part very dexterously, <HI>as I knew she would,</HI> tho' she knew not a Word of the grand Reason of my Indisposition; but I was all sunk, and dead-hearted again, when she told me, She could not understand the Meaning of one Thing in her Visit, <HI>namely,</HI> That the young Woman, <HI>as she call'd her,</HI> that was with the Captain's Lady, and who she call'd Sister, was most impertinently inquisitive into Things; as who I was? how long I had been in <HI>England?</HI> Where I had
<PB N="295" REF="293"/>
liv'd? <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>above all the rest,</HI> she en∣quir'd if I did not live once at the other End of the Town.</P>
<P>I thought her Enquiries so out of the Way, <HI>says the ho∣nest</HI> QUAKER, that I gave her not the least Satisfaction; but as I saw by <HI>thy</HI> Answers on Board the Ship, when she talk'd of <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> did'st not incline to let her be acqu inted with <HI>thee,</HI> so I was resolved that she should not be much the wiser for me; and when she ask'd me if <HI>thou</HI> ever liv'd'st <HI>here</HI> or <HI>there,</HI> I always said <HI>No;</HI> but that <HI>thou</HI> wast a <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady, and was going Home a∣gain to <HI>thy</HI> Family, and liv'd abroad.</P>
<P>I thank'd her very heartily for that Part, and indeed, she serv'd me in it, more than I let her know she did; <HI>in a Word,</HI> she thwarted the Girl so cleverly, that if she had known the whole Affair, she could not have done it better.</P>
<P>But I must acknowledge, all this put me upon the Rack again, and I was quite discourag'd, not at all doubting but that the Jade had a right Scent of Things, and that she knew and remembered my Face, but had artfully conceal'd her Knowledge of me, till she might perhaps, do it more to my Disadvantage: I told all this to <HI>Amy, for she was all the Relief I had:</HI> The poor Soul <HI>(Amy)</HI> was ready to hang herself, that, <HI>as she said,</HI> she had been the Occasion of it all; and that if I was ruin'd, <HI>(which was the Word I always us'd to her)</HI> she had ruin'd me; and she tormented herself about it so much, that I was sometimes fain to comfort her and myself too.</P>
<P>What <HI>Amy</HI> vex'd herself at, was chiefly, that she should be surprized so by the Girl, <HI>as she called her,</HI> I mean surprized into a Discovery of herself to the Girl; which indeed was a false Step of <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and so I had often told her, but 'twas to no Purpose to talk of that now, the Business was, how to get clear of the Girl's Suspicions, and of the Girl too, for it look'd more threatning every Day than other; and if I was uneasy at what <HI>Amy</HI> had told me of her rambling and rattling to her, <HI>(Amy)</HI> I had a thousand Times as much Reason to be uneasy <HI>now,</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="294"/>
when she had chopp'd upon me so unhappily as this; and not only had seen my Face, but knew too where I liv'd, what Name I went by, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>And I am not come to the worst of it yet neither; for a few Days after my Friend the QUAKER had made her Visit, and excused me on the Account of my Indis∣position, as if they had done it in over and above Kind∣ness, because they had been told I was not well, they comes both directly to my Lodgings, to visit me; the Captain's Wife, and my Daughter, <HI>(who she called Sis∣ter)</HI> and the Captain to shew them the Place; the Cap∣tain only brought them to the Door, put them in, and went away upon some Business.</P>
<P>Had not the kind QUAKER, in a lucky Moment, come running in before them, they had not only clapp'd in upon me, in the Parlour, <HI>as it had been a Surprize,</HI> but which would have been a thousand Times worse, had seen <HI>Amy</HI> with me; I think if that had happened, I had had no Remedy, but to take the Girl by herself, and have made myself known to her, which would have been all Distraction.</P>
<P>But the QUAKER, a lucky Creature to me, happened to see them come to the Door, before they rung the Bell, and instead of going to let them in, came running in, with some Confusion in her Countenance, and told me who was a coming; at which, <HI>Amy</HI> run first, and I af∣ter her, and bid the QUAKER come up as soon as she had let them in.</P>
<P>I was going to bid her deny me, but it came into my Thoughts, that having been represented so much cut of Order, it would have look'd very odd; besides, I knew the honest QUAKER, tho' she would do any Thing else for me, would not LYE for me, and it would have been hard to have desir'd it of her.</P>
<P>After she had let them in, and brought them into the Parlour, she came up to <HI>Amy</HI> and I, who were hardly out of the Fright, and yet were congratulating one an∣other, that <HI>Amy</HI> was not surpriz'd again.</P>
<P>They paid their Visit in Form, and I received them as formally; but took Occasion two or three Times to
<PB N="297" REF="295"/>
Kint, that I was so ill that I was afraid I shou'd not be able to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> at least, not so soon as the Cap∣tain must go off; and made my Compliment, how sor∣ry I was to be disappointed of the Advantage of their Company and Astistance in the Voyage; and sometimes I talk'd as if I thought I might stay till the Captain return'd, and wou'd be ready to go again; then the QUAKER put in, That then I might be too far gone, <HI>meaning with Child,</HI> that I shou'd not venture at all; and then <HI>(as if she shou'd be pleas'd with it) added,</HI> She hop'd I wou'd stay and lye in at her House; so as this carried its own Face with it, 'twas well enough.</P>
<P>But it was now high Time to talk of this to my Husband, which however, was not the greatest Dif∣ficulty before me: For after this and other Chat had taken up some Time, the young Fool began her Tat∣tle again; and two or three Times she brought it in, That I was so like a Lady that she had the Honour to know at the other End of the Town, that she cou'd not put the Lady out of her Mind, when I was by, and once or twice I fancy'd the Girl was ready to cry, by and by she was at it again; and at last, I plainly few Tears in her Eyes; upon which, <HI>I ask'd her if the lady was dead, because she seem'd to be in some Concern for her;</HI> she made me much easier by her Answer, than ever she did before: <HI>She said, She did not really know, but she believ'd she was dead.</HI></P>
<P>This, I say, a little reliev'd my Thoughts, but I was soon down again; for after some Time, the Jude began to grow Talkative; and as it was plain, that she had told all that her Head cou'd retain of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Days of Joy which I had spent at that Part of the Town, another Accident had like to have blown us all up again.</P>
<P>I was in a kind of <HI>Dishabille</HI> when they came, hav∣ing on a loose Robe, like a Morning Gown, but much after the <HI>Italian</HI> Way; and I had not alter'd it when I went up, only dress'd my Head a little; and as I had
<PB N="298" REF="296"/>
been represented as having been lately very ill, so the Dress was becoming enough for a Chamber.</P>
<P>This Morning Vest, or Robe, call it as you please, was more shap'd to the Body, than we wear them since, showing the Body in its true Shape, and perhaps, a little too plainly, if it had been to be worn where any Men were to come; but among ourselves it was well enough, especially for hot Weather; the Colour was green, figur'd; and the Stuff a <HI>French</HI> Damask, very rich.</P>
<P>This Gown, or Vest, put the Girl's Tongue a run∣ning again, and her Sister, as she call'd her, prompted it; for as they both admir'd my Vest, and were ta∣ken up much about the Beauty of the Dress, the char∣ming Damask, the noble Trimming, and the like; my Girl puts in a Word to the Sister, <HI>(Captain's Wife)</HI> This is just such a Thing as I told you, says she, the Lady danc'd in: What, <HI>says the Captain's Wife,</HI> the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that you told me of? O! that's a charming Story, says she, tell it my Lady; I cou'd not avoid saying so too, tho' from my Soul I wish'd her in Hea∣ven for but naming it, nay, I won't say but if she had been carried t'other Way, it had been much at one to me, if I cou'd but have been rid of her, and her Sto∣ry too; for when she came to describe the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress, it was imposiible but the QUAKER, who was a sharp pe∣netrating Creature, shou'd receive the Impression in a more dangerous Manner, than the Girl; only that in∣deed, she was not so dangerous a Person; for if the had; known it all, I cou'd more freely have trusted her,; than I cou'd the Girl, by a great deal, nay, I shou'd; have been perfectly easy in her.</P>
<P>However, <HI>as I have said,</HI> her Talk made me dread∣fully unea'y, and the more when the Captain's Wife mention'd but the Name of <HI>Raxana;</HI> what my Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; might do towards betraying me, I know not, because; I cou'd not see myself, but my Heart beat as if it wou'd have jump'd out at my Mouth; and my Passion was so great, that for want of Vent, I thought I shou'd have
<PB N="299" REF="297"/>
burst: <HI>In a Word,</HI> I was in a kind of a silent Rage; for the Force I was under of restraining my Passion was such, as I never felt the like of: I had no Vent, no Body to open myself to, or to make a Complaint to for my Relief; I durst not leave the Room by any means, then she wou'd have told all the Story in my Absence, and I shou'd have been perpetually uneasy to know what she had said; so that, in a Word, I was oblig'd to sit and hear her tell all the Story of <HI>Roxana,</HI> that is to say, of myself, and not know at the same Time, whether she was in earnest or in jest, whether she knew me or no; or, in short, whether I was to be expos'd, or not expos'd.</P>
<P>She began only in general, with telling where she liv'd, what a Place she had of it, how gallant a Company her Lady had always had in the House; how they used to sit up all Night in the House, gaming and dancing; what a fine Lady her Mistress was, and what a vast deal of Money the upper Servants got; as for her, she said, her whole Business was in the next House, so that she got but little, except one Night, that there was twenty Guineas given to be divided among the Ser∣vants, when, she said, she got two Guineas and a half for her Share.</P>
<P>She went on, and told them, how many Servants there was, and how they were order'd; but, she said, there was one Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who was over them all; and that she being the Lady's Favourite, got a great deal; she did not know, she said, whether <HI>Amy</HI> was her Christian Name, or her Sirname, but she suppos'd it was her Sirname; that they were told, she got three∣score Pieces of Gold at one Time, being the same Night that the rest of the Servants had twenty Guineas divided among them.</P>
<P>I put in at that Word, and said, 'twas a vast deal to give away; why, says I, 'twas a Portion for a Ser∣vant: O Madam! says she, it was nothing to what she got afterwards; we that were Servants, hated her heartily for it, that is to say, we wish'd it had been our Lot, in her stead: <HI>Then I said again,</HI> Why, it was
<PB N="300" REF="298"/>
enough to get her a good Husband, and settle her in the World, if she had Sense to manage it: So it might, to be sure, Madam, says she; for we were told, she laid up above 500 <HI>l.</HI> But, I suppose, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was too sensible that her Character wou'd require a good Portion to put her off.</P>
<P>O, said I, if that was the Case, it was another Thing.</P>
<P>Nay, says she, I don't know, but they talk'd very much of a young Lord that was very great with her.</P>
<P>And pray what came of her at last? said I; for I was willing to hear a little <HI>(seeing she wou'd talk of it)</HI> what she had to say, as well of <HI>Amy,</HI> as of myself.</P>
<P>I don't know, Madam, said she, I never heard of her sor several Years, till the other Day, I happen'd to see her.</P>
<P>Did you indeed! says I; <HI>(and made mighty strange of it)</HI> what, and in Rags, it may be, said I, that's of∣ten the End of such Creatures.</P>
<P>Just the contrary, Madam, says she, She came to visit an Acquaintance of mine, little thinking, I sup∣pose, to see me, and, I assure you, she came in her Coach.</P>
<P>In her Coach! said I, upon my Word she had made her Market then; I suppose <HI>she made Hay while the shone;</HI> was she marry'd, pray?</P>
<P>I believe she had been marry'd, Madam, says she, but it seems she had been at the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and if she was marry'd, it was there, to be sure; I think she said she had good luck in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>That is, I suppose, said I, had buried her Husband there.</P>
<P>I understand it so, Madam, says she, and that she had got his Estate.</P>
<P>Was that her good Luck? said I, it might be good to her, as to the Money indeed, but it was but the Part of a Jade, to call it good Luck.</P>
<P>Thus far our Discourse of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> went, and no farther, for she knew no more of her; but then the
<PB N="301" REF="299"/>
QUAKER unhappily, tho' undesignedly, put in a Ques∣tion, which the honest good humour'd Creature wou'd have been far from doing, if she had known that I car∣ry'd on the Discourse of <HI>Amy,</HI> on purpose to drop <HI>Rox∣ana</HI> out of the Conversation.</P>
<P>But I was not to be made easy too soon: The QUAK∣ER put in, But I think thou said'st, something was be∣hind of thy Mistress; what didst thou call her, <HI>Roxana,</HI> was it not? Pray what became of her?</P>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>Roxana,</HI> says the Captain's Wife; pray Sister let's hear the Story of <HI>Roxana;</HI> it will divert my Lady, I'm sure.</P>
<P>That's a damn'd Lye, said I to myself; if you knew how little 'twou'd divert me, you wou'd have too much Advantage over me: Well, I saw no Remedy, but the Story must come on, so I prepar'd to hear the worst of it.</P>
<P><HI>Roxana!</HI> says she, I know not what to say of her; she was so much above us, and so seldom seen, that we cou'd know little of her but by Report, but we did sometimes see her too; she was a charming Wo∣man indeed; and the Footmen us'd to say, that she was to be sent for to Court.</P>
<P>To Court, said I, why she was at Court, w'an't she? the <HI>Pallmall</HI> is not far from <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Madam, says I, but I mean another Way.</P>
<P>I understand thee, says the QUAKER; Thou mean∣est, I suppose, to be Mistress to the KING; yes, Madam, says she.</P>
<P>I cannot help confessing what a Reserve of Pride still was left in me; and tho' I dreaded the Sequel of the Story, yet when she talk'd how handsome and how fine a Lady this <HI>Roxana</HI> was, I cou'd not help being pleas'd and tickled with it, and put in Questions two or three Times, of how handsome she was? and was she really so fine a Woman as they talk'd of, and the like, on purpose to hear her repeat what the People's Opinion of me was, and how I had behav'd.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="300"/>
Indeed, says she at last, she was a most beautiful Cre∣ture, as ever I saw in my Life: But then, said I, you never had the Opportunity to see her, but when she was set out to the best Advantage.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Madam, says she, I have seen her several Times in her <HI>Dishabille:</HI> and I can assure you, she was a very fine Woman; and that which was more still, every body said she did not paint.</P>
<P>This was still agreeable to me one Way; but there was a devilish Sting in the Tail of it all, and this last Article was one; wherein she said, she had seen me se∣veral Times in my <HI>Dishabille:</HI> This put me in Mind, that then she must certainly know me, and it wou'd come out at last; which was Death to me but to think of.</P>
<P>Well, but Sister, says the Captain's Wife, tell my Lady about the Ball, that's the best of all the Story; and of <HI>Roxana</HI>'s dancing in a fine Outlandish Dress.</P>
<P>That's one of the brightest Parts of her Story indeed, says the Girl; the Case was this: We had Balls and Meetings in her Ladyship's Apartments, every Weel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> almost; but one Time my Lady invited all the Nobles to come such a Time, and she wou'd give them a Ball; and there was a vast Crowd indeed, says she.</P>
<P>I think you said, the KING was there, Sister, didn't you?</P>
<P>No, Madam, says she, that was the second Time, when they said the KING had heard how finely are <HI>Turkish</HI> Lady danc'd, and that he was there to see her; but the KING, if His Majesty was there, came disguis'd</P>
<P>That is what they call <HI>Incog.</HI> says my Friend the QUAKER; thou can'st not think the KING wou'd dis∣guise himself; yes, says the Girl, it was so, he did not come in Public, with his Guards, but we all knew which was the KING well enough, that is to say, which they said was the KING.</P>
<P>Well, says the Captain's Wise, about the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress; pray let us hear that: Why, says she, my La∣dy sat in a fine little Drawing-Room, which open'd
<PB N="303" REF="301"/>
into the Great Room, and where she receiv'd the Com∣pliments of the Company; and when the Dancing be∣gan, a great Lord, says she, I forget who they call'd him, (but he was a very great Lord or Duke, I don't know which) took her out, and danc'd with her; but after a while, my Lady on a sudden shut the Drawing-Room, and run up Stairs with her Woman, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and tho' she did not stay long, <HI>(for I suppose she had contriv'd it all before hand)</HI> she came down dress'd in the strangest Figure that ever I saw in my Life; but it was exceeding fine.</P>
<P>Here she went on to describe the Dress, as I have done already; but did it so exactly, that I was surpriz'd at the Manner of her telling it; there was not a Circum∣stance of it left out.</P>
<P>I was now under a new Perplexity; for this young Slut gave so compleat an Account of every Thing in the Dress, that my Friend the QUAKER colour'd at it, and look'd two or three Times at me, to see if I did not do so too; for (as she told me afterwards) she im∣mediately perceiv'd it was the same Dress that she had seen me have on, as I have said before: However, as she saw I took no Notice of it, she kept her Thoughts private to herself; and I did so too, as well as I cou'd.</P>
<P>I put in two or three Times, that she had a good Memory, that cou'd be so particular in every Part of such a Thing.</P>
<P>O Madam! says she, we that were Servants, stood by ourselves in a Corner, but so as we cou'd see more than some Strangers; besides, says she, it was all our Conversation for several Days in the Family, and what one did not observe, another did: Why, says I to her, this was no <HI>Persian</HI> Dress; only, I suppose, your Lady was some <HI>French</HI> Comedian, that is to say, a Stage <HI>Amazon,</HI> that put on a counterfeit Dress to please the Company, such as they us'd in the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> or some such.</P>
<P>No, indeed, Madam, says she, I assure you, my Lady was no Actress; she was a fine modest Lady, fit
<PB N="304" REF="302"/>
to be a Princess; every body said, If she was a Mistress, she was fit to be a Mistress to none but the KING; and they talk'd her up for the KING, as if it had really been so: Besides, Madam, says she, my Lady danc'd a <HI>Turkish</HI> Dance, all the Lords and Gentry said it was so; and one of them swore, he had seen it danc'd in <HI>Turkey</HI> himself; so that it cou'd not come from the Theatre at <HI>Paris;</HI> and then the Name <HI>Roxana,</HI> says she was a <HI>Turkish</HI> Name.</P>
<P>Well, said I, but that was not your Lady's Name, I suppose.</P>
<P>No, no, Madam, said she, I know that; I know my Lady's Name and Family very well; <HI>Roxana</HI> was not her Name that's true indeed.</P>
<P>Here she run me a ground again; for I durst not ask her what was <HI>Roxana</HI>'s real Name, lest she had really dealt with the Devil, and had boldly given my own Name in for Answer: So that I was still more and more afraid that the Girl had really gotten the Secret somewhere or other; tho' I cou'd not imagine neither, how that cou'd be</P>
<P>In a Word, I was sick of the Discourse, and en∣deavour'd many Ways to put an End to it, but it was impossible; for the Captain's Wife, who call'd her Sister, prompted her, and press'd her to tell it, most ignorantly thinking, that it wou'd be a pleasant Tale to all of us.</P>
<P>Two or three Times the QUAKER put in, that this I ady <HI>Roxana</HI> had a good Stock of Assurance; and that 'twas likely, if she had been in <HI>Turkey,</HI> she had liv'd with, or been kept by, some Great <HI>Bassa</HI> there: But still she wou'd break in upon all such Discourse, and fly out into the most extravagant Praises of her Mistress, the fam'd <HI>Roxana:</HI> I run her down, as some scandalous Woman; that it was not possible to be otherwise; but she wou'd not hear of it; her Lady was a Person of such and such Qualifications, that nothing but an Angel was like her, to be sure; and yet, after all she cou'd say, her own Account brought her down to this, That in
<PB N="305" REF="303"/>
short, her Lady kept little less than a Gaming Ordina∣ry; or, <HI>as it wou'd be call'd in the Times since that,</HI> an Assembly for Gallantry and Play.</P>
<P>All this while I was very uneasy, as I said before, and yet the whole Story went off again without any Discovery, only that I seem'd a little concern'd, that she shou'd liken me to this gay Lady, whose Character I pretended to run down very much, even upon the Foot of her own Relation.</P>
<P>But I was not at the End of my Mortifications yet neither; for now my innocent QUAKER threw out an unhappy Expression, which put me upon the Tenters again: <HI>Says she to me,</HI> this Lady's Habit, I fancy, is just such a one as thine, by the Description of it; <HI>and then turning to the Captain's Wife,</HI> says she, <HI>I fancy,</HI> my Friend has a finer <HI>Turkish</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Dress, a great deal: O! says the Girl, 'tis impossible to be finer; my Lady's, says she, was all cover'd with Gold, and Diamonds; her Hair and Head-Dress, I forgot the Name they gave it, said she, shone like Stars, there was so many Jewels in it.</P>
<P>I never wish'd my good Friend the QUAKER out of my Company before now; but indeed, I wou'd have given some Guineas to have been rid of her just now; for beginning to be curious in the comparing the two Dresses, she innocently began a Description of mine; and nothing terrify'd me so much, as the Apprehension lest she shou'd importune me to show it, which I was re∣solv'd I wou'd never agree to.</P>
<P>But before it came to this, she press'd my Girl to de∣scribe the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dress; which she did so cle∣verly, that the QUAKER cou'd not help saying, mine was just such a one; and after several other Similitudes, all very vexatious to me, out comes the kind Motion to me, <HI>to let the Ladies see my Dress;</HI> and they join'd their eager Desires of it even to Importunity.</P>
<P>I desir'd to be excus'd, tho' I had little to say at first why I declin'd it; but at last, it came into my Head to say, <HI>It was pack'd up with my other Cloaths that I had least Occasion for, in order to be sent on board</HI>
<PB N="306" REF="304"/>
<HI>the Captain's Ship;</HI> but that if we liv'd to come to <HI>Holland</HI> together, (which, by the Way, I resolv'd should never happen) then, <HI>I told them,</HI> at unpacking my Cloaths, they shou'd see me dress'd in it; but they must not ex∣pect I shou'd dance in it, like the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> in all her fine Things.</P>
<P>This carry'd it off pretty well; and getting over this, got over most of the rest, and I began to be easy again; and, in a Word, that I may dismiss the Story too, as soon as may be, I got rid at last, of my Visitors, who I had wish'd gone two Hours sooner than they intend∣ed it.</P>
<P>As soon as they were gone, I run up to <HI>Amy,</HI> and gave Vent to my Passions, by telling her the whole Sto∣ry, and letting her see what Mischiefs one false Step of hers had like, unluckily, to have involv'd us all in, more perhaps, than we cou'd ever have liv'd to get through: <HI>Amy</HI> was sensible of it enough, and was just giving her Wrath a Vent another Way, <HI>viz.</HI> by calling the poor Girl all the damn'd Jades and Fools, <HI>(and some∣times worse Names)</HI> that she cou'd think of; in the mid∣dle of which, up comes my honest good QUAKER, and put an End to our Discourse: The QUAKER came in smiling, (for she was always soberly chearful) <HI>Well, says she, Thou art deliver'd at last; I come to joy thee of it; I perceiv'd thou wert tir'd grievously of thy Visitors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> says I, <HI>so I was;</HI> that foolish young Girl held us all in a <HI>Canterbury Story,</HI> I thought she wou'd never have done with it: Why truly, I thought she was very careful to let thee know she was but a Cookmaid: Ay, says I, and at a Gaming House, or Gaming Or∣dinary, and at t'other end of the Town too; all which <HI>(by the Way)</HI> she might know, wou'd add very little to her Good Name among us Citizens.</P>
<P>I can't think, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, but she had some other Drift in that long Discourse; there's something else in her Head, says she, I am satisfy'd of that: <HI>Thought I,</HI> are you satisfy'd of it? I am sure I am the less satisfy'd for that; at least, 'tis but small Satisfaction to me, to hear you say so: What can this be? says I,
<PB N="307" REF="305"/>
and when will my Uneasinesses have an End? <HI>But this was silent, and to myself, you may be sure:</HI> But in An∣swer to my Friend the QUAKER, I return'd, by asking her a Question or two about it: As what she thought was in it? and why she thought there was any Thing in it? For, says I, she can have nothing in it relating to me.</P>
<P>Nay, says the kind QUAKER, if she had any View towards thee, that's no Business of mine; and I shou'd be far from desiring thee to inform me.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me again; not that I feared trusting the good humour'd Creature with it, if there had been any Thing of just Suspicion in her; but this Affair was a Se∣cret I car'd not to communicate to any body: However, I say, this alarm'd me a little; for as I had conceal'd every Thing from her, I was willing to do so still; but as she cou'd not but gather up abundance of Things from the Girl's Discourse, which look'd towards me, so she was too penetrating to be put off with such Answers, as might stop another's Mouth: Only there was this double Felicity in it; <HI>first,</HI> That she was not inquisitive to know, or find any Thing out; and not dangerous, if she had known the whole Story: But, as I say, she cou'd not but gather up several Circumstances from the Girl's Discourse; as particularly, the Name of <HI>Amy;</HI> and the several Descriptions of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress, which my Friend the QUAKER had seen, and taken so much Notice of, <HI>as I have said before.</HI></P>
<P>As for that, I might have turn'd it off by jesting with <HI>Amy,</HI> and asking her who she liv'd with before she came to live with me? But that would not do; for we had un∣happily anticipated that Way of talking, by having of∣ten talk'd how long <HI>Amy</HI> had liv'd with me; and which was still worse, by having own'd formerly, that I had had Lodgings in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> so that all these Things corresponded too well. There was only one Thing that help'd me out with the QUAKER, and that was the Girl's having reported how rich Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was grown, and that she kept her Coach; now as there might be many more Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>'s besides mine, so it was not like∣ly
<PB N="308" REF="306"/>
to be my <HI>Amy,</HI> because she was far from such a Figure as keeping her Coach; and this carried it off from the Suspicions, which the good friendly QUAKER might have in her Head.</P>
<P>But as to what she imagined the Girl had in her Head, there lay more real Difficulty in that Part, a great deal; and I was alarm'd at it very much; for my Friend the QUAKER told me, She observed that the Girl was in a great Passion when she talk'd of the Ha∣bit, and more when I had been importun'd to shew her mine, but declin'd it. <HI>She said,</HI> She several Times per∣ceived her to be in Disorder, and to restrain herself with great Difficulty; and once or twice she muttered to her∣self, that <HI>she had found it out;</HI> or, that <HI>she would find it out,</HI> she could not tell whether; and that she often saw Tears in her Eyes; that when I said my Suit of <HI>Turkish</HI> Cloaths was put up, but that she should see it when we arrived in <HI>Holland,</HI> she heard her say softly, <HI>She would go over on Purpose then.</HI></P>
<P>After she had ended her Observations, <HI>I added,</HI> I ob∣served too, that the Girl talk'd and look'd oddly, and that she was very inquisitive, but I could not imagine what it was she aim'd at: Aim'd at, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, 'tis plain to me what she aims at; she believes that thou art the same Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that danc'd in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Vest, but she is not certain. Does she believe so! <HI>says I;</HI> If I had thought that, I would have put her out of her Pain. Believe so! <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, Yes; and I be∣gan to believe so too, and should have believed so still, if thou had'st not satisfied me to the contrary, by <HI>thy</HI> taking no Notice of it, and by what thou hast said since. Should you have believ'd so? <HI>said I, warmly,</HI> I am ve∣ry sorry for that; why, would you have taken me for an <HI>Actress,</HI> or a <HI>French Stage-player?</HI> No, <HI>says the good kind Creature, thou</HI> carriest it too far; as soon as thou madest <HI>thy</HI> Reflections upon her, I knew it could not be; but who could think any other, when she describ'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dress which <HI>thou</HI> hast here, with the Head-tire and Jewels; and when she nam'd thy Maid <HI>Amy</HI> too, and several other Circumstances concurring? I should
<PB N="309" REF="307"/>
certainly have behaved it, <HI>said she,</HI> if <HI>thou</HI> hadst not contradicted it; but as soon as I heard <HI>thee</HI> speak, I con∣cluded it was otherwise. That was very kind, <HI>said I,</HI> and I am obliged to you for doing me so much Justice; 'tis more, it seems, than that young talking Creature does. Nay, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, indeed she does not do <HI>thee</HI> Justice; for she as certainly believes it still, as ever she did. Does she, <HI>said I?</HI> Ay, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, and I warrant <HI>thee</HI> she'll make <HI>thee</HI> another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about it. Will she, <HI>says I?</HI> then I believe I shall downright affront her. No, <HI>thou</HI> shalt not affront her, <HI>says she,</HI> (full of her good Humour and Temper) I'll take that Part off thy Hands, for I'll affront her for thee, and not let her see <HI>thee.</HI> I thought that was a very kind Offer, but was at a Loss how she would be able to do it; and the Thought of seeing her again half distracted me, not knowing what Temper she would come in, much less what Manner to receive her in; but my fast Friend and constant Comforter, the QUAKER, <HI>said,</HI> she perceived the Girl was impertinent, and that I had no Inclination to converse with her; and she was resolved I should not be troubled with her. But I shall have Occasion to say more of this presently; for this Girl went further yet than I thought she had.</P>
<P>It was now Time, <HI>as I said before,</HI> to take Measures with my Husband, in Order to put off my Voyage; so I sell into Talk with him one Morning as he was dres∣sing, and while I was in Bed; I pretended I was very ill; and as I had but too easy a Way to impose upon him, because he so absolutely believed every Thing I said; so I manag'd my Discourse so, as that he should understand by it, I was a breeding, tho' I did not tell him so.</P>
<P>However, I brought it about so handsomely, that be∣fore he went out of the Room, he came and sat down by my Bed-side, and began to talk very seriously to me upon the Subject of my being so every Day ill; and that, as he hop'd I was with Child, he would have me consider well of it, whether I had not best alter my Thoughts of the Voyage to <HI>Holland;</HI> for that being Sea-sick, and
<PB N="310" REF="308"/>
which was worse, if a Storm should happen, might be very dangerous to me. And after saying Abundance of the kindest Things that the kindest of Husbands in the World could say, he concluded, That it was his Re∣quest to me, that I would not think any more of going, till after all should be over; but that I would, <HI>on the con∣trary,</HI> prepare to ly in where I was, and where I knew as well as he, I could be very well provided, and very well assisted.</P>
<P>This was just what I wanted; for I had, <HI>as you have heard,</HI> a thousand good Reasons why I should put off the Voyage, <HI>especially</HI> with that Creature in Company, but I had a Mind the putting it off should be at his Mo∣tion, not my own; and he came into it of himself, just as I would have had it. This gave me an Opportuni∣ty to hang back a little, and to seem as if I was unwill∣ing: <HI>I told him,</HI> I could not abide to put him to Diffi∣culties and Perplexities in his Business; that now he had hir'd the Great-Cabbin in the Ship, <HI>and perhaps,</HI> paid some of the Money, and, <HI>it may be,</HI> taken Freight for Goods; and to make him break it all off again, would be a needless Charge to him, <HI>or perhaps,</HI> a Damage to the Captain.</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>he said,</HI> it was not to be nam'd, and he would not allow it to be any Consideration at all; that he could easily pacify the Captain of the Ship, by tel∣ling him the Reason of it; and that if he did make him some Satisfaction for the Disappointment, it should not be much.</P>
<P>But my Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> you ha'n't heard me say I am with Child, neither can I say so; and if it should not be so at last, then I shall have made a sine Piece of Work of it indeed; besides, <HI>says I,</HI> the two Ladies, the Cap∣tain's Wife, and her Sister, they depend upon our going over, and have made great Preparations, and all in Com∣pliment to me; what must I say to them?</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> if you should not be with Child, tho' I hope you are, yet there is no Harm done; the staying three or four Months longer in <HI>England</HI> will be no Damage to me, and we can go when we please,
<PB N="311" REF="309"/>
when we are sure you are not with Child, or when it ap∣pearing that you are with Child, you shall be down and up again; and as for the Captain's Wife and Sister, leave that Part to me, I'll answer for it, there shall be no Quarrel raised upon that Subject, I'll make your Ex∣cuse to them by the Captain himself; so all will be well enough there, I warrant you.</P>
<P>This was as much as I could desire; and thus it rested for a while. I had indeed some anxious Thoughts about this impertinent Girl, but believed that putting off the Voyage would have put an End to it all; so I began to be pretty easy; but I found myself mistaken, for I was brought to the Point of Destruction by her again, and that in the most unaccountable Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>My Husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting the Captain of the Ship, took the Freedom to tell him, That he was afraid he must disappoint him, for that something had fallen out, which had obliged him to al∣ter his Measures, and that his Family could not be ready to go Time enough for him.</P>
<P>I know the Occasion, Sir, <HI>says the Captain;</HI> I hear your Lady has got a Daughter more than she expected; I give you Joy of it. What do you mean by that? <HI>says my Spouse.</HI> Nay, nothing, <HI>says the Captain,</HI> but what I hear the Women tattle over the Tea-table. I know no∣thing, but that you don't go the Voyage upon it, which I am sorry for; but you know your own Affairs, <HI>added the Captain,</HI> that is no Business mine.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>says my Husband,</HI> I must make you some Satisfaction for the Disappointment, and so he pulls out his Money. No, no, <HI>says the Captain,</HI> and so they fell to straining their Compliments one upon another; but, <HI>in short,</HI> my Spouse gave him three or four Guineas, and made him take it; and so the first Discourse went off again, and they had no more of it.</P>
<P>But it did not go off so easily with me; for now, <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Clouds began to thicken about me, and I had Alarms on every Side. My Husband told me what the Captain had said; but very happily took it, that the Captain had brought a Talc by Halves, and
<PB N="312" REF="310"/>
having heard it one Way, had told it another; and that neither could he understand the Captain, neither did the Captain understand himself; so he contented himself to tell me, <HI>he said,</HI> Word for Word, as the Captain de∣livered it.</P>
<P>How I kept my Husband from discovering my Disorder, <HI>you shall hear presently;</HI> but let it suffice to say just now, that if my Husband did not understand the Captain, nor the Captain understand himself, yet I understood them both very well; and to tell the Truth it was a worse Shock than ever I had had yet. Invention supplied me indeed with a sudden Motion to avoid shewing my Sur∣prize; for as my Spouse and I was sitting by a little Table near the Fire, I reach'd out my Hand, as if I had in∣tended to take a Spoon which lay on the other Side, and threw one of the Candles off of the Table; and then snatching it up, started up upon my Feet, and stoop'd to the Lap of my Gown, and took it in my Hand; O! <HI>says I,</HI> my Gown's spoil'd, the Candle has greased it prodigiously. This furnished me with an Excuse to my Spouse, to break off the Discourse for the present, and call <HI>Amy</HI> down; and <HI>Amy</HI> not coming presently, <HI>I said to him,</HI> My Dear, I must run up Stairs, and put it off, and let <HI>Amy</HI> clean it a little; so my Husband rose up too, and went into a Closet, where he kept his Papers and Books, and fetch'd a Book out, and sat down by him∣self to read.</P>
<P>Glad I was that I had got away; and up I run to <HI>A∣my,</HI> who, as it happened, was alone; O <HI>Amy! says I,</HI> we are all utterly undone; and with that, I burst out a crying, and could not speak a Word for a great while.</P>
<P>I cannot help saying, that some very good Reflections offer'd themselves upon this Head; it presently occurr'd, What a glorious Testimony it is to the Justice of Provi∣dence, and to the Concern Providence has in guiding all the Affairs of Men, <HI>(even the least, as well as the greatest)</HI> that the most secret Crimes are, by the most unforeseen Accidents, brought to light, and discover'd.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="311"/>
Another Reflection was, How just it is, that Sin and Shame follow one another so constantly at the Heels, that they are not like Attendants only, but like Cause and Consequence, necessarily connected one with another; that the Crime going before, the Scandal is certain to follow; and that 'tis not in the Power of human Na∣ture to conceal the first, or avoid the last.</P>
<P>What shall I do? <HI>Amy,</HI> said I, <HI>as soon as I could speak,</HI> and what will become of me? And then I cried again so vehemently that I could say no more a great while. <HI>Amy</HI> was frighted almost out of her Wits, but knew no∣thing what the Matter was; but she begg'd to know, and perswaded me to compose myself, and not cry so. Why, Madam, if my Master should come up now, <HI>says she,</HI> he will see what a Disorder you are in; he will know you have been crying, and then he will want to knows the Cause of it; with that I broke out again, O! he knows it already, <HI>Amy,</HI> says I, he knows all! 'tis all discovered! and we are undone! <HI>Amy</HI> was Thunder∣struck now indeed. Nay, <HI>says</HI> Amy, if that be true, we are undone indeed; but that can never be; that's impossible, I am sure.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says I,</HI> 'tis far from impossible, for I te'l you 'tis so; and by this Time being a little recovered, I told her what Discourse my Husband and the Captain had had together, and what the Captain had said. This put <HI>Amy</HI> into such a Hurry, that she cry'd, she rav'd, she swore and curs'd like a mad Thing; then she upbraided me, that I would not let her kill the Girl when she would have done it, and that it was all my own doing, <HI>and the like.</HI> Well however, I was not for killing the Girl yet, I could not bear the Thoughts of that nei∣ther.</P>
<P>We spent half an Hour in these Extravagancies, and brought nothing out of them neither; for indeed we could do nothing or say nothing that was to the Pur∣pose; for if any Thing was to come cut-of-the-Way, there was no hindering it, nor Help for it; so after thus giving Vent to myself by crying, I began to reflect how I had left my Spouse below, and what I had pretended
<PB N="314" REF="312"/>
to come up for; so I changed my Gown that I pre∣tended the Candle fell upon, and put on another, and went down.</P>
<P>When I had been down a good while, and found my Spouse did not fall into the Story again, as I expected, I took Heart and called for it. My Dear, <HI>said I,</HI> the Fall of the Candle put you out of your History, won't you go on with it? What History? <HI>says he.</HI> Why, <HI>says I,</HI> about the Captain. O! <HI>says he,</HI> I had done with it, I know no more than the Captain told a broken Piece of News that he had heard by Halves, and told more by Halves than he heard it; <HI>namely,</HI> of your being with Child, and that you could not go the Voyage.</P>
<P>I perceiv'd my Husband enter'd not into the Thing at all, but took it for a Story, which being told two or three Times over, was puzzl'd, and come to nothing; and that all that was meant by it was, what he knew, or thought he knew already, <HI>viz.</HI> that I was with Child, which he wish'd might be true.</P>
<P>His Ignorance was a Cordial to my Soul; and I curs'd them in my Thoughts, that should ever undeceive him; and as I saw him willing to have the Story end there, as not worth being farther mentioned, I clos'd it too; <HI>and said,</HI> I suppos'd the Captain had it from his Wife; she might have found somebody else to make her Remarks upon, and so it pass'd off with my Husband well enough, and I was still safe there, where I thought myself in most Danger; but I had two Uneasinesses still; the first was, lest the Captain and my Spouse should meet again, and enter into farther Discourse about it; and the second was, lest the busy impertinent Girl should come again, and when she came how to prevent her see∣ing <HI>Amy,</HI> which was an Article as material as any of the rest; for seeing <HI>Amy</HI> would have been as fatal to me as her knowing all the rest.</P>
<P>As to the first of these, I knew the Captain could not stay in Town above a Week; but that his Ship being already full of Goods, and fallen down the River, he must soon follow; so I contriv'd to carry my Husband

somewhere out of Town for a few Days, that they might be sure not to meet.</P>
<P>My greatest Concern was, where we should go; at last I fix'd upon <HI>North-Hall;</HI> not, <HI>I said,</HI> that I would drink the Waters, but that I thought the Air was good, and might be for my Advantage. He, who did every Thing upon the Foundation of obliging me, readily came into it, and the Coach was appointed to be ready the next Morning; but as we were settling Matters, he put in an ugly Word that thwarted all my Design; and that was, That he had rather I would stay till After∣noon, for that he should speak to the Captain next Morn∣ing, if he could, to give him some Letters; which he could do, and be back again about twelve o' Clock.</P>
<P><HI>I said, Ay, by all Means;</HI> but it was a Cheat on him, and my Voice and my Heart differ'd; for I resolved, <HI>if possible,</HI> he should not come near the Captain, nor see him, whatever came of it.</P>
<P>In the Evening therefore, a little before we went to Bed, I pretended to have altered my Mind, and that I would not go to <HI>North-Hall,</HI> but I had a Mind to go an∣other Way, <HI>but I told him,</HI> I was afraid his Business would not permit him; he wanted to know where it was? <HI>I told him, smiling,</HI> I would not tell him, lest it should oblige him to hinder his Business. <HI>He answered,</HI> with the same Temper, <HI>but with infinitely more Sinceri∣ty,</HI> That he had no Business of so much Consequence, as to hinder him going with me any where that I had a Mind to go: <HI>Yes,</HI> says I, <HI>you want to speak with the Captain before he goes away.</HI> Why that's true, <HI>says he, so I do,</HI> and paus'd a while; and <HI>then added,</HI> But I'll write a Note to a Man that does Business for me, to go to him; 'tis only to get some Bills of Loading sign'd, and he can do it. When I saw I had gain'd my Point, I seem'd to hang back a little; my Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> don't hinder an Hour's Business for me; I can put it off for a Week or two, rather than you shall do yourself any Pre∣judice. No, no, <HI>says he,</HI> you shall not put it off an Hour for me, for I can do my Business by Proxy with any Body, <HI>but my</HI> WIFE; <HI>and then he took me in his</HI>
<PB N="316" REF="314"/>
<HI>Arms and kiss'd me.</HI> How did my Blood flush up into my Face! when I reflected how sincerely, how affectionate∣ly this good-humour'd Gentleman embrac'd the most cursed Piece of Hypocrisy that ever came into the Arms of an honest Man? His was all Tenderness, all Kind∣ness, and the utmost Sincerity; mine all Grimace and Deceit, a Piece of meer Menage, and fram'd Conduct to conceal a pass'd Life of Wickedness, and prevent his discovering that he had in his Arms a She-Devil, whose whole Conversation for twenty five Years had been black as Hell, a Complication of Crime; and for which, had he been let into it, he must have abhor'd me, and the very Mention of my Name. But there was no Help for me in it; all I had to satisfy myself was, that it was my Business to be what I was, and conceal what I had been; that all the Satisfaction I could make him, was to live virtuously for the Time to come, not being able to retrieve what had been in Time past; and this I re∣solv'd upon, tho' had the great Temptation offered, as it did afterwards, I had Reason to question my Stabili∣ty. <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>After my Husband had kindly thus given up his Mea∣sures to mine, we resolved to set out in the Morning early. <HI>I told him,</HI> that my Project, <HI>if he lik'd it,</HI> was, to go to <HI>Tunbridge;</HI> and he, being entirely passive in the Thing, agreed to it with the greatest Willingness; <HI>but said,</HI> If I had not nam'd <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he would have nam'd <HI>Newmarket; (there being a great Court there, and Abundance of fine Things to be seen)</HI> I offer'd him another Piece of Hypocrisy here, for I pretended to be willing to go thither, <HI>as the Place of his Choice,</HI> but in∣deed I would not have gone for a thousand Pounds; for the COURT being there at that Time, I durst not run the Hazard of being known at a Place where there were so many Eyes that had seen me before. So that, <HI>after some Time,</HI> I told my Husband, that I thought <HI>New∣market</HI> was so full of People at that Time, that we should get no Accommodation; that seeing the COURT and the Crowd was no Entertainment to me, unless as it might be so to him, that if he thought fit, we would
<PB N="317" REF="315"/>
rather put it off to another Time; and that if, when he went to <HI>Holland,</HI> we should go by <HI>Harwich,</HI> we might take a Round by <HI>Newmarket</HI> and <HI>Bury,</HI> and so come to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and go from thence to the Sea side. He was easily put off from this, as he was from any Thing else, that I did not approve; and so with all imagina∣ble Facility he appointed to be ready early in the Morn∣ing to go with me for <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P>I had a double Design in this, <HI>viz. First,</HI> To get a∣way my Spouse from seeing the Captain any more; and <HI>secondly,</HI> To be out of the Way myself, in Case this impertinent Girl, who was now my Plague, should offer to come again, as my Friend the QUAKER be∣lieved she would, and as indeed happened within two or three Days afterwards.</P>
<P>Having thus secur'd my going away the next Day, I had nothing to do but to furnish my faithful Agent, the QUAKER, with some Instructions what to say to this Tormentor, (for such she prov'd afterwards) and how to manage her, if she made any more Visits than ordinary.</P>
<P>I had a great Mind to leave. <HI>Amy</HI> behind too, as an Assistant, because she understood so perfectly well, what to advise upon any Emergence; and <HI>Amy</HI> importun'd me to do so; but I know not what secret Impulse pre∣vail'd over my. Thoughts against it, I could not do it, for fear the wicked Jade should make her away, which my very Soul abhor'd the Thoughts of; which how∣ever, <HI>Amy</HI> found Means to bring to pass afterwards, as I may in Time relate more particularly.</P>
<P>It is true, I wanted as much to be delivered from her as ever a sick Man did from a Third-day Ague; and had she dropp'd into the Grave by any fair Way, <HI>as I may call it,</HI> I mean, had she died of any ordinary Dis∣temper, I should have shed but very sew Tears for her. But I was not arrived to such a Pitch of obstinate Wick∣edness, as to commit Murther, especially such as to murder my own Child, or so much as to harbour a Thought so barbarous in my Mind. But, <HI>as I said,</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="316"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> effected all afterwards, without my Knowledge, for which I gave her my hearty Curse, tho' I could do little more; for to have fallen upon <HI>Amy,</HI> had been to have murdered myself. But this Tragedy requires a longer Story than I have Room for here. <HI>I return to my Journey.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Friend the QUAKER was kind, and yet ho∣nest, and would do any Thing that was just and up∣right, to serve me, but nothing wicked or dishonour∣able; that she might be able to say boldly to the Crea∣ture, if she came, she did not know where I was gone, she desired I would not let her know; and to make her Ignorance the more absolutely safe to herself, and like∣wise to me, I allowed her to say, that she heard us talk of going to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> &amp;c. She lik'd that Part, and I left all the rest to her to act as she thought sit, only charg'd her, that if the Girl entered into the Story of the <HI>Pallmall,</HI> she should not entertain much Talk about it; but let her understand, that we all thought she spoke of it a little too particularly; and that the Lady <HI>(mean∣ing me)</HI> took it a little ill, to be so likened to a public Mistress, or a Stage-player, <HI>and the like;</HI> and so to bring her, if possible, to say no more of it. How∣ever, tho' I did not tell my Friend the QUAKER how to write to me, or where I was, yet I left a sealed Pa∣per with her Maid to give her, in which I gave her a Direction how to write to <HI>Amy,</HI> and so in Effect to my∣self.</P>
<P>It was but a few Days after I was gone, but the im∣patient Girl came to my Lodgings on Pretence to see how I did, and to hear if I intended to go the Voyage, <HI>and the like.</HI> My trusty Agent was at Home, and re∣ceived her coldly at the Door; <HI>but told her,</HI> That the Lady, <HI>which she supposed she meant,</HI> was <HI>gone from her House.</HI></P>
<P>This was a full Stop to all she could say for a good while; but as she stood musing some Time at the Door, considering what to begin a Talk upon, she perceived my Friend the QUAKER look'd a little uneasy, as if
<PB N="319" REF="317"/>
she wanted to go in and shut the Door, which stung her to the Quick; and the wary QUAKER had not so much as asked her to come in; for seeing her alone she ex∣pected she would be very impertinent; and concluded, that I did not care how coldly she received her.</P>
<P>But she was not to be put off so. <HI>She said,</HI> if the Lady—was not to be spoke with, she desired to speak two or three Words with her, <HI>meaning my Friend the</HI> QUAKER. Upon that the QUAKER civilly, but coldly, ask'd her to walk in, which was what she wanted. <HI>No e,</HI> She did not carry her into her best Parlour, <HI>as formerly,</HI> but into a little outer Room, where the Ser∣vants usually waited.</P>
<P>By the first of her Discourse she did not stick to insi∣nuate, as if she believed I was in the House, but was unwilling to be seen; and press'd earnestly that she might speak but two Words with me; to which she added earnest Entreaties, and at last Tears.</P>
<P>I am sorry, <HI>says my good Crcature the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> hast so ill an Opinion of me, as to think I would tell <HI>thee</HI> an Untruth, <HI>and say,</HI> that the Lady—was gone from my House, if she was not? I assure <HI>thee</HI> I do not use any such Method; nor does the Lady—desire any such kind of Service from me, as I know of. If she had been in the House, I should have told <HI>thee</HI> so.</P>
<P><HI>She said little to that,</HI> but said, it was Business of the utmost Importance, that she desired to speak with me about; <HI>and then cry'd again very much.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> seem'st to be sorely afflicted, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, I wish I could give <HI>thee</HI> any Relief; but if nothing will comfort <HI>thee</HI> but seeing the Lady—, it is not in my Power.</P>
<P>I hope it is, <HI>says she again;</HI> to be sure it is of great Consequence to me, so much, that I am undone with∣out it.</P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> troublest me very much, to hear <HI>thee</HI> say so, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER; but why then did'st <HI>thou</HI> not speak to her apart, when <HI>thou</HI> wast here before.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="318"/>
I had no Opportunity, <HI>says she,</HI> to speak to her alone, and I could not do it in Company; if I could have spoken but two Words to her alone, I would have thrown myself at her Foot, and ask'd her Blessing.</P>
<P>I am surpriz'd at <HI>thee;</HI> I do not understand <HI>thee, says the</HI> QUAKER.</P>
<P>O! <HI>says she,</HI> stand my Friend, if you have any Cha∣rity, or if you have any Compassion for the miserable; for I am utterly undone!</P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> terrify'st me, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, with such pas∣sionate Expressions; for <HI>verily</HI> I cannot comprehend <HI>thee.</HI></P>
<P>O! <HI>says she,</HI> She is my Mother; She is my Mother; and she does not own me.</P>
<P><HI>Thy</HI> Mother! <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, and began to be greatly mov'd indeed; I am astonish'd at <HI>thee;</HI> what dost <HI>thou</HI> mean?</P>
<P>I mean nothing but what I say, <HI>says she, I say again,</HI> She is my Mother! and will not own me; <HI>and with that she stopp'd with a Flood of Tears.</HI></P>
<P>Not own <HI>thee!</HI> says the QUAKER; and the tender good Creature wept too; why, <HI>she says,</HI> she does not know <HI>thee,</HI> and never saw <HI>thee</HI> before.</P>
<P>No, <HI>says the Girl,</HI> I believe she does not know me, but I know her; and I know that she is my Mother.</P>
<P>It's impossible! <HI>Thou</HI> talkest Mystery, <HI>says the</HI> QUAK∣ER; wilt thou explain thyself a little to me?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>says she,</HI> I can explain it well enough; I am sure she is my Mother, and I have broke my Heart to search for her; and now to lose her again, when I was so sure I had found her, will break my Heart more effectually.</P>
<P>Well, but if she be thy Mother, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, How can it be, that she should not know <HI>thee?</HI></P>
<P>Alas! <HI>says she,</HI> I have been lost to her ever since I was a Child: She has never seen me.</P>
<P>And hast thou never seen her? <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says she,</HI> I have seen her, often enough, I saw her; for when she was the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> I was her
<PB N="321" REF="319"/>
House-maid, <HI>being a Servant,</HI> but I did not know her then nor she me, but it has all come out since; has she not a Maid nam'd <HI>Amy? Note, the honest</HI> QUAKER <HI>was non∣pluss'd, and greatly surprized at that Question.</HI></P>
<P>Truly, <HI>says she,</HI> the Lady—has several Wo∣men Servants, but I do not know all their Names.</P>
<P>But her Woman, her Favourite, <HI>adds the Girl;</HI> is not her Name <HI>Amy?</HI></P>
<P>Why truly, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>with a very happy Turn of Wit,</HI> I do not like to be examin'd; but lest <HI>thou</HI> should'st take up any Mistakes, by Reason of my Back∣wardness to speak, I will answer <HI>thee</HI> for once, That what her Woman's Name is, I know not; but they call her <HI>Cherry.</HI></P>
<Q>N. B. <HI>My Husband gave her that Name in Jest, on our Wedding day, and we had called her by it ever after; so that she spoke literally true at that Time.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>The Girl reply'd very modestly,</HI> That she was sorry if she gave her any Offence in asking; that she did not design to be rude to her, or pretend to examine her; but that she was in such an Agony at this Disaster, that she knew not what she did or said; and that she should be very sorry to disoblige her, but begg'd of her again, as she was a Christian and a Woman, and had been a Mother of Children, that she would take Pity on her, and, <HI>if possible,</HI> assist her, so that she might but come to me, and speak a few Words to me.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted QUAKER told me, the Girl spoke this with such moving Eloquence, that it forc'd Tears from her; but she was oblig'd to say, That she neither knew where I was gone, or how to write to me; but that if she did ever see me again, she would not fail to give me an Account of all we had said to her, or that she should yet think fit to say; and to take my Answer to it, if I thought fit to give any.</P>
<P>Then the QUAKER took the Freedom to ask a few Particulars about this wonderful Story, <HI>as she called it;</HI> at which, the Girl beginning at the first Distresses of my
<PB N="322" REF="320"/>
Life, <HI>and indeed of her own,</HI> went thro' all the History of her miserable Education, her Service under the Lady <HI>Roxana, as she call'd me,</HI> and her Relief by Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> with the Reasons she had to believe, that as <HI>Amy</HI> own'd herself to be the same that liv'd with her Mother, <HI>and especially,</HI> that <HI>Amy</HI> was the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Maid too, and came out of <HI>France</HI> with her, she was by those Cir∣cumstances and several others in her Conversation, as fully convinc'd, that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mother, as she was that the Lady—at her House <HI>[the Quaker's]</HI> was the very same <HI>Roxana</HI> that she had been Servant to.</P>
<P>My good Friend the QUAKER, tho' terribly shock'd at the Story, and not well knowing what to say, yet was too much my Friend to seem convinc'd in a Thing, which, if it was true, she could see plainly I had a Mind should not be known; so she turn'd her Discourse to ar∣gue the Girl out of it: She insisted upon the slender E∣vidence she had of the Fact itself, and the Rudeness of claiming so near a Relation of one so much above her, and of whose Concern in it she had no Knowledge, <HI>at least,</HI> no sufficient Proof; that as the Lady at her House was a Person above any Disguises, so she could not be∣lieve that she would deny her being her Daughter, if she was really her Mother; that she was able suffici∣ently to have provided for her, if she had not a Mind to have her known; and therefore, seeing she had heard all she had said of the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> and was so far from owning herself to be the Person, that she had cen∣sur'd that sham Lady as a Cheat, and Common Woman; and that 'twas certain she could never be brought to own a Name and Character she had so justly expos'd.</P>
<P>Beside, she told her, that her Lodger, meaning me, was not a Sham Lady, but the real Wife of a Knight Baronet; and that she knew her to be honestly such, and far above such a Person as she had describ'd: <HI>She then added,</HI> that she had another Reason why it was not very possible to be true, <HI>and that is, says she,</HI> Thy Age is in the Way; for thou acknowledgest, that thou art four and twenty Years old; and that thou wast the
<PB N="323" REF="321"/>
youngest of three of thy Mother's Children; so that by thy Account, thy Mother must be extremely young, or this Lady cannot be thy Mother; for thou seest, <HI>says she,</HI> and any one may see, she is but a young Woman now, and cannot be suppos'd to be above forty Years old if she is so much, and is now big with Child at her going into the Country; so that I cannot give any Cre∣dit to thy Notion of her being thy Mother, and if I might Counsel thee, it shou'd be to give over that Thought, as an improbable Story that does but serve to disorder thee, and disturb thy Head, for, added she, I perceive thou art much disturb'd indeed.</P>
<P>But this was all nothing: She cou'd be satisfy'd with nothing but seeing me; but the QUAKER defended her∣self very well, and insisted on it, that she cou'd not give her any Account of me; and finding her still importunate, she affected at last, being a little disgusted that she shou'd not believe her, and added, That indeed, if she had known where I was gone, she wou'd not have given any one an Account of it, unless I had given her Orders to do so; but seeing she has not acquainted me, <HI>says she,</HI> where she is gone, 'tis an Intimation to me, she was not desirous it shou'd be publickly known; and with this she rose up, which was as plain a desiring her to rise up too, and be gone, as cou'd be express'd, ex∣cept the downright showing her the Door.</P>
<P>Well, the Girl rejected all this, <HI>and told her,</HI> She cou'd not indeed expect that she (the QUAKER) shou'd be affected with the Story she had told her, however mo∣ving; or that she shou'd take any Pity on her: That it was her Misfortune, that when she was at the House before, and in the Room with me, she did not beg to speak a Word with me in private, or throw herself upon the Floor at my Feet, and claim what the Affection of a Mother wou'd have done for her; but since she had slipp'd her Opportunity, she wou'd wait for another; that she found by her <HI>the Quaker</HI>'s) Talk, that she had not quite left her Lodgings, but was gone into the Coun∣try, <HI>she suppos'd,</HI> for the Air; and she was resolv'd she wou'd take so much <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> upon her, that she
<PB N="324" REF="322"/>
wou'd visit all the Airing-Places in the Nation, and even all the Kingdom over, ay, and <HI>Holland</HI> too, but she wou'd find me; for she was satisfy'd the cou'd so con∣vince me that she was my own Child, that I wou'd not deny it; and she was sure I was so tender and compas∣sionate, I wou'd not let her perish after I was convinc'd that she was my own Flesh and Blood; and in saying she wou'd visit all the Airing-Places in <HI>England,</HI> she re∣ckon'd them all up by Name, and began with <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> the very Place I was gone to; then reckoning up <HI>Epsom, North-hall, Barnet, Newmarket, Bury,</HI> and at last, the <HI>Bath:</HI> and with this she took her Leave.</P>
<P>My faithful Agent the QUAKER, fail'd not to write to me immediately; but as she was a cunning, as well as an honest Woman, it presently occurr'd to her, that this was a Story, which, whether true or false, was not very fit to come to my Husband's Knowledge; that as she did not know what I might have been, or might have been cali'd in former Times, and how far there might have been something or nothing in it, so she thought if it was a Secret, I ought to have the telling it myself; and if it was not, it might as well be publick asterwards, as now; and that, at least, she ought to leave it where she found it, and not hand it forwards to any body without my Consent: These prudent Measures were inexpressibly kind, as well as seasonable; for it had been likely enough that her Letter might have come publickly to me, and tho' my Husband wou'd not have open'd it, yet it wou'd have look'd a little odd that I shou'd conceal its Contents from him, when I had pre∣tended so much to communicate all my Affairs.</P>
<P>In Consequence of this wise Caution, my good Friend only wrote me in few Words, That the impertinent young Woman had been with her, as she expected she wou'd; and that she thought it wou'd be very convenient that, if I cou'd spare <HI>Cherry,</HI> I wou'd send her up, (meaning <HI>Amy)</HI> because she found there might be some Occasion for her.</P>
<P>As it happen'd, this Letter was enclos'd to <HI>Amy</HI> her∣self, and not sent by the Way I had at first order'd; but
<PB N="325" REF="323"/>
it came safe to my Hands; and tho' I was alarm'd a lit∣tle at it, yet I was not acquainted with the Danger I was in of an immediate Visit from this teizing Creature, till afterwards; and I run a greater Risque indeed, than ordi∣ry, in that I did not send <HI>Amy</HI> up under fourteen Days, believing myself as much concealed at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as if I had been at <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>But the Concern my faithful SPY, <HI>(for such my</HI> QUAKER <HI>was now, upon the meer foot of her own Sa∣gacity)</HI> I say, her Concern for me, was my Safety in this Exigence, when I was, as it were, keeping no Guard for myself; for finding <HI>Amy</HI> not come up, and that she did not know how soon this wild Thing might put her design'd Ramble in Practice, she sent a Mes∣senger to the Captain's Wife's House, where she lodg'd, to tell her that she wanted to speak with her: She was at the Heels of the Messenger, and came eager for some News; and hop'd, she said the Lady (meaning me) had been come to Town.</P>
<P>The QUAKER, with as much Caution as she was Mistress of, not to tell a downright Lye, made her be∣lieve she expected to hear of me very quickly; and fre∣quently by the by, speaking of being Abroad to take the Air, talk'd of the Country about <HI>Bury,</HI> how pleasant it was, how wholesome, and how fine an Air; how the <HI>Downs</HI> about <HI>Newmarket</HI> were exceeding fine; and what a vast deal of Company there was, now the Court was there; till at last, the Girl began to conclude, that <HI>my Ladyship</HI> was gone thither; for, she said, She knew I lov'd to see a great deal of Company.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says my Friend,</HI> thou takest me wrong, I did not suggest, says she, that the Person thou enquir'st after is gone thither, neither do I believe she is, I assure thee: Well, the Girl smil'd, and let her know, that she be∣liev'd it for all that; so, to clench it fast, Verily, <HI>says she, with great Seriousness,</HI> thou dost not do well, for thou suspectest every Thing, and believest nothing: I speak solemnly to thee, that I do not believe they are gone that Way; so if thou givest thyself the Trouble to go that Way, and art disappointed, do not say that I
<PB N="326" REF="324"/>
have deceiv'd thee: She knew well enough, that if this did abate her Suspicion, it wou'd not remove it; and that it wou'd do little more than amuse her; but by this she kept her in suspence till <HI>Amy</HI> came up, and that was enough.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> came up, she was quite confounded, to hear the Relation which the QUAKER gave her, and found Means to acquaint me of it; only letting me know, to my great Satisfaction, that she wou'd not come to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> first; but that she wou'd certainly go to <HI>New∣market</HI> or <HI>Bury</HI> first.</P>
<P>However, it gave me very great Uneasiness; for as she resolv'd to ramble in search after me, over the whole Country, I was safe no where, no, not in <HI>Holland</HI> itself; so indeed, I did not know what to do with her: and thus I had a <HI>Bitter</HI> in all my <HI>Sweet,</HI> for I was continu∣ally perplexed with this Hussy, and thought she haunted me like an Evil Spirit.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, <HI>Amy</HI> was next Door to stark-mad about her; she durst not see her at my Lodgings, for her Life; and she went Days without Number, to <HI>Spit∣tle-Fields,</HI> where she us'd to come, and to her former Lodging, and cou'd never meet with her; at length, she took up a mad Resolution, that she wou'd go direct∣ly to the Captain's House in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and speak with her; it was a mad Step, that's true, but, as <HI>Amy</HI> said, she was mad, so nothing she cou'd do cou'd be otherwise: For if <HI>Amy</HI> had found her at <HI>Redriff,</HI> she <HI>(the Girl)</HI> wou'd have concluded presently, that the QUAKER had given her Notice, and so that we were all of a Knot, and that, in short, all she had said was right: But as it happen'd, things came to hit better than we expected; for that <HI>Amy</HI> going out of a Coach, to take Water at <HI>Tower-Wharf,</HI> meets the Girl just come on Shore, hav∣ing cross'd the Water from <HI>Redriff: Amy</HI> made as if she wou'd have pass'd by her, tho' they met so full that she did not pretend she did not see her, for she look'd fairly upon her first, but then turning her Head away, with a Slight, offer'd to go from her; but the Girl stopp'd, and spoke first, and made some Manners to her.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="325"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> spoke coldly to her, and a little angry, and after some Words, standing in the Street, or Passage, <HI>the Girl saying,</HI> she seemed to be angry, and wou'd not have spoken to her: <HI>Why, says</HI> Amy, <HI>How can you ex∣pect I shou'd have any more to say to you, after I had done so much for you, and you have behav'd so to me?</HI> The Girl seem'd to take no Notice of that now, but an∣swer'd, <HI>I was going to wait on you now:</HI> Wait on me! <HI>says Amy,</HI> What do you mean by that? Why, <HI>says she a∣gain, with a kind of Familiarity,</HI> I was going to your Lodgings.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was provok'd to the last Degree at her; and yet she thought it was not her Time to resent, because she had a more fatal and wicked Design in her Head, a∣gainst her; which indeed, I never knew till after it was executed, nor durst <HI>Amy</HI> ever communicate it to me; for as I had always express'd myself vehemently against hurt∣ing a Hair of her Head, so she was resolv'd to take her own Measures without consulting me any more.</P>
<P>In order to this, <HI>Amy</HI> gave her good Words, and con∣cealed her Resentment as much as she cou'd; and when she talk'd of going to her Lodging, <HI>Amy</HI> smiled, and said nothing, but call'd for a Pair of Oars to go to <HI>Greenwich;</HI> and ask'd her, seeing she said she was going to her Lodging, to go along with her, for she was going Home, and was all alone.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did this with such a Stock of Assurance, that the Girl was confounded, and knew not what to say; but the more she hesitated, the more <HI>Amy</HI> press'd her to go; and talking very kindly to her, <HI>told her,</HI> If she did not go to see her Lodgings, she might go to keep her Company, and she wou'd pay a Boat to bring her back again; so, <HI>in a Word, Amy</HI> prevailed on her to go into the Boat with her, and carry'd her down to <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain <HI>Amy</HI> had no more Business at <HI>Greenwich</HI> than I had; nor was she going thither; but we were all hamper'd to the last Degree, with the Impertinence of this Creature; and in particular, I was horribly per∣plexed with it.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="326"/>
As they were in the Boat, <HI>Amy</HI> began to reproach her with Ingratitude, in treating her so rudely, who had done so much for her, and been so kind to her; and to ask her what she had got by it? or what she expect∣ed to get? Then came in my Share, the Lady <HI>Roxana. Amy</HI> jested with that, and banter'd her a little; <HI>and ask'd her,</HI> if she had found her yet?</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> was both surpriz'd and enrag'd, when the Girl told her roundly, That she thank'd her for what she had done for her; but that she wou'd not have her think she was so ignorant, as not to know that what she <HI>[Amy]</HI> had done, was by her Mother's Order; and who she was beholden to for it: That she cou'd never make Instruments pass for Principals, and pay the Debt to the Agent, when the Obligation was all to the Ori∣ginal: That she knew well enough who she was, and who she was employ'd by: That she knew the Lady—very well, <HI>(naming the Name that I now went by)</HI> which was my Husband's true Name, and by which she might know whether she had found out her Mother or no.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> wish'd her at the Bottom of the <HI>Thames;</HI> and had there been no Watermen in the Boat, and no body in sight, <HI>she swore to me,</HI> she wou'd have thrown her into the River: I was horribly disturb'd when she told me this Story, and began to think this wou'd, at last, all end in my Ruin; but when <HI>Amy</HI> spoke of throwing her into the River, and drowning her, I was so pro∣vok'd at her, that all my Rage turn'd against <HI>Amy,</HI> and I fell thorowly out with her: I had now kept <HI>Amy</HI> al∣most thirty Years, and found her, on all Occasions, the faithfullest Creature to me, that ever Woman had; <HI>I say,</HI> faithful to me; for however wicked she was, still she was true to me; and even this Rage of hers was all upon my Account, and for fear any Mischief shou'd befal me.</P>
<P>But be that how it wou'd, I cou'd not bear the Men∣tion of her Murthering the poor Girl, and it put me so beside myself, that I rose up in a Rage, and bade her get out of my Sight, and out of my House; told her, I had kept her too long, and that I wou'd never see
<PB N="329" REF="327"/>
her Face more. I had before told her, That she was a Murtherer, and a bloody minded Creature; that she cou'd not but know that I cou'd not bear the Thought of it, much less the Mention of it; and that it was the impu∣dentest Thing that ever was known, to make such a Proposal to me, when she knew that I was really the Mother of this Girl, and that she was my own Child; that it was wicked enough in her, but that she must con∣clude I was ten Times wickeder than herself, if I cou'd come into it: That the Girl was in the right, and I had nothing to blame her for; but that it was owing to the Wickedness of my Life, that made it necessary for me to keep her from a Discovery; but that I wou'd not murther my Child, tho' I was otherwise to be ruined by it: <HI>Amy</HI> reply'd somewhat rough and short, Would I not, but she wou'd, she said, if she had an Opportu∣nity: and upon these Words it was that I bade her get out of my Sight, and out of my House; and it went so far, that <HI>Amy</HI> pack'd up her Auls, and march'd off, and was gone for almost good and all: <HI>But of that in its Order; I must go back to the Relation of the Voyage which they made to</HI> Greenwich <HI>together.</HI></P>
<P>They held on the Wrangle all the Way by Water; the Girl insisted upon her knowing that I was her Mo∣ther, and told her all the History of my Life in the <HI>Pall∣mall,</HI> as well after her being turn'd away, as before; and of my Marriage since, and which was worse, not only who my present Husband was, but where he had lived, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> She knew nothing of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> or of where we were going to live, <HI>Namely,</HI> at <HI>Nim∣guen; but told her in so many Words,</HI> That if she could not find me here, she would go to <HI>Holland</HI> after me.</P>
<P>They landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and <HI>Amy</HI> carried her into the Park with her, and they walk'd above two Hours there, in the farthest and remotest Walks.; which <HI>Amy</HI> did, because as they talk'd with great Heat, it was ap∣parent they were quarrelling, and the People took No∣tice of it.</P>
<P>They walk'd till they came almost to the Wilderness, at the <HI>South</HI> side of the Park; but the Girl perceiving</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="328"/>
<HI>Amy</HI> offer'd to go there, among the Woods, and Trees, stopp'd short there, and wou'd go no farther; but said, She wou'd not go in there.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> smil'd, and ask'd her what was the Matter? <HI>She replied short,</HI> She did not know where she was, nor where she was going to carry her, and she wou'd go no farther; and without any more Ceremony, turns back, and walks apace away from her: <HI>Amy</HI> own'd she was sur∣priz'd, and came back too, and call'd to her; upon which the Girl stopt, and <HI>Amy</HI> coming up to her, ask'd her, what she meant?</P>
<P>The Girl boldly reply'd, She did not know but she might murther her; and that, in short, she wou'd not trust herself with her; and never wou'd come into her Company again alone.</P>
<P>It was very provoking, but however, <HI>Amy</HI> kept her Temper, with much Difficulty, and bore it, knowing that much might depend upon it; so she mock'd her foolish Jealousy, and told her she need not be uneasy for her, she wou'd do her no Harm, and wou'd have done her Good, if she wou'd have let her; but since she was of such a resractory Humour, she shou'd not trouble herself, for she shou'd never come into her Company again; and that neither she, or her Brother, or Sister, shou'd ever hear from her, or see her any more; and so she shou'd have the Satisfaction of being the Ruin of her Brother and Sister, as well as of herself.</P>
<P>The Girl seem'd a little mollified at that, <HI>and said</HI> That for herself, she knew the worst of it, she cou'd seek her Fortune; but 'twas hard her Brother and Sister shou'd suffer on her Score; and said something that was tender, and well enough, on that Account: <HI>But Amy told her,</HI> It was for her to take that into Consideration for she wou'd let her see that it was all her own; that she wou'd have done them all Good, but that having been us'd thus, she wou'd do no more for any of them; and that she shou'd; not need to be afraid to come into he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Company again, for she wou'd never give her Occa∣sion for, it any more; <HI>this, by the Way,</HI> was false in the Girl
<PB N="331" REF="329"/>
too, for she did venture into <HI>Amy's</HI> Company again after that, once too much, <HI>as I shall relate by itself.</HI></P>
<P>They grew cooler however, afterwards, and <HI>Amy</HI> carry'd her into a House at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where she was acquainted, and took an Occasion to leave the Girl in a Room a while, to speak to the People in the House, and so prepare them to own her as a Lodger in the House; and then going in to her again, told her, There she lodg'd, if she had a Mind to find her out; or if any body else had any Thing to say to her; and so <HI>Amy</HI> dis∣miss'd her, and got rid of her again; and finding an empty Hackney Coach in the Town, came away by Land to <HI>London,</HI> and the Girl going down to the Wa∣ter-side, came by Boat.</P>
<P>This Conversation did not answer <HI>Amy's</HI> End at-all, because it did not secure the Girl from pursuing her Design of hunting me out; and tho' my indefatigable Friend the QUAKER amus'd her three or four Days, yet I had such Notice of it at last, that I thought fit to come away from <HI>Tunbridge</HI> upon it, and where to go I knew not; but, in short, I went to a little Village upon <HI>Epping-Forrest,</HI> call'd <HI>Woodford,</HI> and took Lodgings in a Private House, where I liv'd retir'd about fix Weeks, till I thought she might be tir'd of her Search, and have given me over.</P>
<P>Here I receiv'd an Account from my trusty QUAKER, that the Wench had really been at <HI>Tubridge,</HI> had found out my Lodgings, and had told her Tale there in a most dismal Tone; that she had follow'd us as she thought, to <HI>London;</HI> but the QUAKER had answer'd her, That she knew nothing of it, which was indeed true; and had admonished her to be easy, and not to hunt af∣ter People of such Fashion as we were, as if we were Thieves; that she might be assured, that since I was not willing to see her, I wou'd not be forced to do it; and treating me thus wou'd effectually disoblige me: And with such Discourses as these she quieted her; and <HI>she (the</HI> QUAKER) <HI>added,</HI> that she hoped I should not be troubled much more with her.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="330"/>
It was in this Time that <HI>Amy</HI> gave me the History of her <HI>Greenwich</HI> Voyage, when she spoke of drowning and killing the Girl in so serious a Manner, and with such un apparent Resolution of doing it, that, <HI>as I said,</HI> put me in a Rage with her, so that I effectually turn'd her away from me, <HI>as I have said above,</HI> and she was gone; nor did she so much as tell me whither, or which Way she was gone; on the other hand, when I came to reflect on it, that I now had neither Assistant nor Con∣fident to speak to, or receive the least Information from, <HI>my Friend the</HI> QUAKER <HI>excepted,</HI> it made me very uneasy.</P>
<P>I waited, and expected, and wonder'd, from Day to Day, still thinking <HI>Amy</HI> would one Time or other, think a little, and come again, or at least, let me hear of her; but for ten Days together I heard nothing of her. I was so impatient, that I got neither Rest by Day, or Sleep by Night, and what to do I knew not; I durst not go to Town to the QUAKER's, for Fear of meeting that vexaticus Creature, <HI>my Girl,</HI> and I cou'd get no Intelligence, where I was; so I got my Spouse, upon Pretence of wanting her Company, to take the Coach one Day, and fetch my good QUAKER to me.</P>
<P>When I had her, I durst ask her no Questions, nor hardly knew which End of the Business to begin to talk of; but of her own Accord she told me, that the Girl had been three or four Times haunting her for News from me; and that she had been so troublesome, that she had been obliged to shew herself a little angry with her, and, <HI>at last, told her plainly,</HI> that she need give herself no Trouble in searching after me, by her Means; for she <HI>(the</HI> QUAKER) would not tell her, if she knew; upon which she refrain'd a while. But on the other Hand, <HI>she told me,</HI> it was not safe for me to send my Coach for her to come in; for she had some Reason to believe, that she <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> watch'd her Door Night and Day, nay, and watch'd her too every Time she went in and out; for she was so bent upon a Discovery, that she spared no Pains; and she believed she had taken a Lodging ve∣ry near their House for that Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="331"/>
I could hardly give her a Hearing of all this, for my Eagerness to ask for <HI>Amy;</HI> but I was confounded when she told me she had heard nothing of her; 'tis impossible to express the anxious Thoughts that rowl'd about in my Mind, and continually perplexed me about her; par∣ticularly, I reproach'd myself with my Rashness in turn∣ing away so faithful a Creature, that for so many Years had not only been a Servant, but an Agent; and not only an Agent, but a Friend, and a faithful Friend too.</P>
<P>Then I consider'd too, that <HI>Amy</HI> knew all the Secret History of my Life, had been in all the Intrigues of it, and been a Party in both Evil and Good, and at best, there was no Policy in it; that as it was very ungene∣rous and unkind, to run Things to such an Extremity with her, and for an Occasion too, in which all the Fault she was guilty of, was owing to her Excess of Care for my Safety; so it must be only her steddy Kind∣ness to me, and an Excess of generous Friendship for me, that should keep her from ill-using me in Return for it; which ill-using me was enough in her Power, and might be my utter Undoing.</P>
<P>These Thoughts perplex'd me exceedingly, and what Course to take, I really did not know. I began indeed to give <HI>Amy</HI> quite over, for she had now been gone a∣bove a Fortnight; and as she had taken away all her Cloaths, and her Money too, <HI>which was not a little,</HI> and so had no Occasion of that kind to come any more, so she had not left any Word where she was gone, or to which Part of the World I might send to hear of her.</P>
<P>And I was troubled on another Account too, <HI>viz.</HI> That my Spouse and I too had resolved to do very hand∣somely for <HI>Amy,</HI> without considering what she might have got another Way at all; but we had said nothing of it to her; and so I thought, as she had not known what was likely to fall in her Way, she had not the In∣fluence of that Expectation to make her come back.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Perplexity of this Girl, who hunted me, as if, <HI>like a Hound,</HI> she had had a hot Scent, but was now at a Fault; <HI>I say,</HI> that Perplexity, and
<PB N="334" REF="332"/>
this other Part, of <HI>Amy</HI> being gone, issued in this, I re∣solved to be gone, and go over to <HI>Holland;</HI> there I be∣lieved I should be at rest. So I took Occasion one Day to tell my Spouse, that I was afraid he might take it ill that I had amus'd him thus long, and that, <HI>at last,</HI> I doubted I was not with Child; and that since it was so, our Things being pack'd up, and all in Order for going to <HI>Holland,</HI> I would go away now, when he pleas'd.</P>
<P>My Spouse, who was perfectly easy, whether in go∣ing or staying, left it all entirely to me; so I consider'd of it, and began to prepare again for my Voyage; but alas! I was irresolute to the last Degree. I was, for Want of <HI>Amy,</HI> destitute; I had lost my Right-hand, she was my Steward, gather'd in my Rents, <HI>I mean my In∣terest-money,</HI> and kept my Accompts, and, <HI>in a Word</HI> did all my Business, and without her indeed I knew not how to go away, or how to stay. But an Accident thrust itself in here, and that even in <HI>Amy</HI>'s Conduct too which frighted me away, and without her too in the ut∣most Horror and Confusion.</P>
<P>I have related how my faithful Friend the QUAKER was come to me, and what Account she gave me of he being continually haunted by my Daughter; and that <HI>as she said,</HI> she watch'd her very Door, Night and Day <HI>the Truth was,</HI> she had set a SPY to watch so effectually that <HI>she (the Quaker)</HI> neither went in or out, but <HI>she</HI> had Notice of it.</P>
<P>This was too evident, when the next Morning after she came to me, <HI>(for I kept her all Night)</HI> to my un∣speakable Surprize, I saw a Hackney-Coach stop at the Door where I lodg'd, and saw her <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> in the Coach all alone. It was a very good Chance in the middle of a bad one, that my Husband had taken out the Coach that very Morning, and was gone to <HI>London</HI> as for me, I had neither Life or Soul left in me, I was so confounded, I knew not what to do or to say.</P>
<P>My <HI>happy Visitor</HI> had more Presence of Mind than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>and ask'd me,</HI> if I had made no Acquaintance among the Neighbours? <HI>I told her,</HI> Yes, there was a Lady lodg'd two Doors off, that I was very intimate with; but has<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="335" REF="333"/>
hast <HI>thou</HI> no Way out backward to go to her? <HI>says she.</HI> Now it happened there was a Back-Door in the Garden, by which we usually went and come to and from the House; so I told her of it. <HI>Well, well,</HI> says she, <HI>go out and make a Visit then, and leave the rest to me.</HI> A∣way I run, told the Lady, <HI>(for I was very free there)</HI> that I was a Widow to Day, my Spouse being gone to <HI>London,</HI> so I came not to visit her, but to dwell with her that Day; because also, our Landlady had got Strang∣ers from <HI>London.</HI> So having fram'd this orderly LYE, I pull'd some Work out of my Pocket, <HI>and added,</HI> I did not come to be idle.</P>
<P>As I went out one Way, my Friend the QUAKER went the other, to receive this unwelcome Guest. The Girl made but little Ceremony; but having bid the Coachman ring at the Gate, gets down out of the Coach, and comes to the Door; a Country-Girl going to the Door, (belonging to the House) for the QUAKER forbid any of my Maids going. <HI>Madam</HI> ask'd for my QUAKER by Name, and the Girl ask'd her to walk in.</P>
<P>Upon this, my QUAKER seeing there was no hang∣ing-back, goes to her immediately, but put on all the Gravity upon her Countenance that she was Mistress of; and that was not a little indeed.</P>
<P>When <HI>she (the</HI> QUAKER) came into the Room, <HI>(for they had shewed my Daughter into a little Parlour)</HI> she kept her grave Countenance, but said not a Word; nor did my <HI>Daughter</HI> speak a good while; but after some Time, my <HI>Girl</HI> began, <HI>and said,</HI> I suppose you know me, Madam.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, I know <HI>thee;</HI> and so the Dia∣logue went on.</P>

<P>I much wonder how <HI>thou</HI> couldst have such an Account; if I had come out to see her, <HI>thou</HI> hast hap∣pened to miss the House; for I assure <HI>thee, she</HI> is not to be found in this House.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the Girl importun'd her again, with the utmost Earnestness, and cry'd bitterly; insomuch, that my
<PB N="337" REF="335"/>
poor QUAKER was softened with it, and began to per∣swade me to consider of it, and, if it might consist with my Affairs, to see her, and hear what she had to say; but this was afterwards. <HI>I return to the Discourse.</HI></P>
<P>The QUAKER was perplex'd with her a long Time; she talk'd of sending back the Coach, and lying in the Town all Night. This my Friend knew would be ve∣ry uneasy to me, but she durst not speak a Word against it; but on a sudden Thought, she offered a bold Stroke, which, tho' dangerous if it had happened wrong, had its desired Effect.</P>
<P><HI>She told her,</HI> That as for dismissing her Coach, that was as she pleased; she believed, she would not easily get a Lodging in the Town; but that as she was in a strange Place, she wou'd so much befriend her, that she wou'd speak to the People of the House, that if they had Room, she might have a Lodging there for one Night, rather than be forced back to <HI>London,</HI> before she was free to go.</P>
<P>This was a cunning, tho' a dangerous Step, and it succeeded accordingly, for it amus'd the Creature en∣tirely, and she presently concluded, that really I cou'd not be there then; otherwise she wou'd never have ask'd her to lie in the House: So she grew cold again present∣ly, as to her lodging there; and said, No, since it was so, she wou'd go back that Afternoon, but she would come again in two or three Days, and search that, and all the Towns round, in an effectual Manner, if she staid a Week or two to do it; for in short, if I was in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> she wou'd find me.</P>
<P>In Truth, says the QUAKER, thou wilt make me very hurtful to <HI>thee</HI> then: Why so, <HI>says she?</HI> Because wherever I go, <HI>thou</HI> wilt put <HI>thyself</HI> to great Expence, and the Country to a great deal of unnecessary Trouble. Not unnecessary, <HI>says she.</HI> Yes truly, <HI>says the</HI> QUAKER, it must be unnecessary, because it will be to no Purpose; I think I must abide in my own House, to save <HI>thee</HI> that Charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>She said little to that, except that, <HI>she said,</HI> she would give her as little Trouble as possible; but she was afraid
<PB N="338" REF="336"/>
she should sometimes be uneasy to her, which she hop'd she would excuse. My QUAKER <HI>told her,</HI> She would much rather excuse her, if she would forbear; for that, if she would believe her, she would assure her, she should never get any Intelligence of me, by her.</P>
<P>That set her into Tears again; but after a while re∣covering herself, <HI>she told her,</HI> Perhaps she might be mis∣taken; and she <HI>(the</HI> QUAKER) should watch herself, ve∣ry narrowly; or she might one Time or another get some Intelligence from her, whether she would or no; and she was satisfy'd she had gain'd some of her by this Journey; for that if I was not in the House, I was not far off; and if I did not remove very quickly, she would find me out. Very well, <HI>says my</HI> QUAKER; then if the Lady is not willing to see <HI>thee, thou</HI> givest me No∣tice to tell her, that she may get out of <HI>thy</HI> Way.</P>
<P>She flew out in a Rage at that, <HI>and told my Friend,</HI> that if she did, a Curse would follow her, and her Children after her; and denounc'd such horrid Things upon her, as frighted the poor tender-hearted QUAKER strangely, and put her more out of Temper than ever I saw her be∣fore; so that she resolved to go Home the next Morn∣ing; and I, that was ten times more uneasy than she, re∣solved to follow her, and go to <HI>London</HI> too; which how∣ever, upon second Thoughts, I did not; but took effec∣tual Measures not to be seen or own'd, if she came any more; but I heard no more of her for some Time.</P>
<P>I stayed there about a Fortnight, and in all that Time I heard no more of her, or of my QUAKER about her; but after about two Days more, I had a Letter from my QUAKER, intimating, that she had something of Mo∣ment to say, that she could not communicate by a Let∣ter, but wish'd I would give myself the Trouble to come up; directing me to come with the Coach into <HI>Good∣man's-fields,</HI> and then walk to her Back-door on Foot, which being left upon on Purpose, the watchful Lady, if she had any Spies, could not well see me.</P>
<P>My Thoughts had for so long Time been kept, as it were, waking, that almost every Thing gave me the Alarm, and this especially, so that I was very uneasy;

but I could not bring Matters to bear, to make my com∣ing to <HI>London</HI> so clear to my Husband as I would have done; for he lik'd the Place, and had a Mind, <HI>he said,</HI> to stay a little longer, if it was not against my Inclina∣tion; so I wrote my Friend the QUAKER Word, <HI>That I could not come to Torvn yet;</HI> and that besides, I could not think of being there under Spies, and afraid to look out of Doors; and so, <HI>in short,</HI> I put off going for near a Fortnight more.</P>
<P>At the End of that Time she wrote again, <HI>in which she told me,</HI> That she had not lately seen the <HI>impertinent Visitor,</HI> which had been so troublesome; but that she had seen my <HI>trusty Agent Amy,</HI> who told her she had cry'd for six Weeks without Intermission; that <HI>Amy</HI> had given her an Account how troublesome the Creature had been, and to what Straights and Perplexities I was driven, by her hunting after, and following me from Place to Place. Upon which, <HI>Amy</HI> had said, That notwith∣standing I was angry with her, and had us'd her so hard∣ly, for saying something about her of the same kind; yet there was an absolute Necessity of securing her, and removing her out of the Way; and that, <HI>in short,</HI> with∣out asking my Leave, or any Body's Leave, she would take Care she should trouble her Mistress <HI>(meaning me)</HI> no more; and that after <HI>Amy</HI> had said so, she had in∣deed never heard any more of the Girl; so that she sup∣posed <HI>Amy</HI> had manag'd it so well, as to put an End to it.</P>
<P>The innocent well-meaning Creature, my QUAKER, who was all Kindness and Goodness in herself, <HI>and parti∣cularly to me,</HI> saw nothing in this, but she thought <HI>Amy</HI> had found some Way to perswade her to be quiet and easy, and to give over teizing and following me, and rejoic'd in it for my Sake; as she thought nothing of a∣ny Evil herself, so she suspected none in any Body else, and was exceeding glad of having such good News to write to me. But my Thoughts of it run otherwise.</P>
<P>I was struck, as with a Blast from Heaven, at the reading her Letter; I fell into a Fit of trembling from Head to Foot, and I ran raving about the Room like a
<PB N="340" REF="338"/>
mad Woman; I had no Body to speak a Word to, to give Vent to my Passion; nor did I speak a Word for a good while, till after it had almost overcome me. I threw myself upon the Bed, and cry'd out, <HI>Lord be mer∣ciful to me, she has murdered my Child,</HI> and with that, a Flood of Tears burst out, and I cry'd vehemently for above an Hour.</P>
<P>My Husband was very happily gone out a hunting, so that I had the Opportunity of being alone, and to give my Passions some Vent, by which I a little recovered myself. But after my Crying was over, then I fell in a new Rage at <HI>Amy,</HI> I called her a thousand Devils, and Monsters, and hard-hearted Tygers; I reproach'd her with her knowing that I abhor'd it, and had let her know it sufficiently, in that I had, <HI>as it were,</HI> kick'd her out of Doors, after so many Years Friendship and Service, only for naming it to me.</P>
<P>Well, after some Time my Spouse came in from his Sport, and I put on the best Looks I could to deceive him; but he did not take so little Notice of me, as not to see I had been crying, and that something troubled me; and he press'd me to tell him; I seem'd to bring it out with Reluctance, <HI>but told him,</HI> My Backwardness was more because I was ashamed that such a Trifle should have any Effect upon me than for any Weight that was in it. So <HI>I told him,</HI> I had been vexing my∣self about my Woman <HI>Amy</HI>'s not coming again; that she might have known me better than not to believe I should have been Friends with her again, <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>in short,</HI> I had lost the best Servant by Rash∣ness that ever Woman had.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>says he,</HI> if that be all your Grief, I hope you will soon shake it off; I'll warrant you, in a little while we shall hear of Mrs <HI>Amy</HI> again; and so it went off for that Time. But it did not go off with me; for I was uneasy, and terrify'd to the last Degree, and want∣ed to get some farther Account of the Thing. So I went to my sure and certain Comforter the QUAKER, and there I had the whole Story of it; and the good in∣nocent
<PB N="341" REF="339"/>
QUAKER gave me Joy of my being rid of such an unsufferable Tormentor.</P>
<P>Rid of her! Ay, says I, if I was rid of her fairly and honourably; but I don't know what <HI>Amy</HI> may have done; sure she ha'n't made her away: O fie! says my QUAKER, how can'st <HI>thou</HI> entertain such a Notion? No, no, made her away! <HI>Amy</HI> didn't talk like that; I dare say, thou may'st be easy in that, <HI>Amy</HI> has nothing of that in her Head, I dare say, says she, and so threw it, as it were, out of my Thoughts.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; it run in my Head continually, Night and Day I cou'd think of nothing else; and it fix'd such a Horror of the Fact upon my Spirits, and such a Detestation of <HI>Amy,</HI> whom I look'd upon as the Murderer, that, as for her, I believe, if I cou'd have seen her, I shou'd certainly have sent her to <HI>Newgate,</HI> or to a worse Place, upon Suspicion; indeed, I think I I cou'd have kill'd her with my own Hands.</P>
<P>As for the poor Girl herself, she was ever before my Eyes; I saw her by Night, and by Day; she haunted my Imagination, if she did not haunt the House; my Fancy show'd her me in a hundred Shapes and Postures; sleeping or waking, she was with me. Sometimes I thought I saw her with her Throat cut, sometimes with her Head cut, and her Brains knock'd out, other Times hang'd up upon a Beam, another Time drown'd in the Great Pond at <HI>Camberwell.</HI> And all these Appearances were terrifying to the last Degree; and that which was still worse, I cou'd really hear nothing of her: I sent to the Captain's Wife in <HI>Redriff, and she answer'd me,</HI> She was gone to her Relations in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> I sent thi∣ther, <HI>and they said,</HI> she was there about three Weeks ago; but that she went out in a Coach with the Gentle∣woman that us'd to be so kind to her, but whither she was gone, they knew not; for she had not been there since. I sent back the Messenger for a Description of the Woman she went out with; and they describ'd her so perfectly, that I knew it to be <HI>Amy,</HI> and none but <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="340"/>
<HI>I sent her Word again,</HI> That Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who she went out with, left her in two or three Hours; and that they shou'd search for her, for I had Reason to fear she was murder'd. This frighted them all intollerably; they believ'd <HI>Amy</HI> had carry'd her to pay her a Sum of Mo∣ney, and that somebody had watch'd her after her hav∣ing receiv'd it, and had robb'd and murder'd her.</P>
<P>I believ'd nothing of that Part, but I believ'd as it was, That whatever was done, <HI>Amy</HI> had done it; and that, in short, <HI>Amy</HI> had made her away; and I believ'd it the more, because <HI>Amy</HI> came no more near me, but confirm'd her Guilt by her Absence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mourn'd thus for her, for above a Month; but finding <HI>Amy</HI> still not come near me, and that I must put my Affairs in a Posture that I might go to <HI>Holland,</HI> I open'd all my Affairs to my dear trusty Friend, the QUAKER, and placed her, in Matters of Trust, in the Room of <HI>Amy,</HI> and with a heavy, bleed∣ing Heart for my poor Girl, I embark'd with my Spouse, and all our Equipage and Goods, on board ano∣ther <HI>Holland Trader,</HI> not a Packet Boat, and went over to <HI>Holland;</HI> where I arrived, as I have said.</P>
<P>I must put in a Caution however here, that you must not understand me as if I let my Friend the QUAKER into any Part of the Secret History of my former Life; nor did I commit the Grand reserv'd Article of all, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t her, <HI>viz.</HI> that I was really the Girl's Mother, and the Lady <HI>Roxana;</HI> there was no need of that Part being ex∣pos'd; and it was always a Maxim with me, <HI>That Se∣crets shou'd never be open'd, without evident Utility.</HI> It could be of no manner of Use to me, or her, to commu∣nicate that Part to her; besides, she was too honest herself, to make it safe to me, for tho' she lov'd me sincerely, and it was plain, by many Circumstances, that she did so, yet she would not <HI>Lye</HI> for me upon Occasion, as <HI>Amy</HI> wou'd, and therefore it was not advisable on any Terms to communicate that Part; for if the Girl or any one else, should have come to her afterwards, and put it home to her, Whether she knew that I was the Girl's Mother or not; or was the same as the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> or
<PB N="343" REF="341"/>
not, she either wou'd not have denied it, or would have done it with so ill a Grace, such Blushing, such Hesi∣tations, and Fadl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings in her Answers, as wou'd have put the Matter out of doubt, and betray'd herself and the Secret too.</P>
<P>For this Reason, I say, I did not discover any thing of that kind to her; but I plac'd her, as I have said, in <HI>Amy</HI>'s stead, in the other Affairs of receiving Money, Interests, Rents, and the like, and she was as faithful as <HI>Amy</HI> could be, and as diligent.</P>
<P>But there fell out a great Difficulty here, which I knew not how to get over; and this was, how to con∣vey the usual Supply, or Provision and Money, to the Uncle and the other Sister, who depended, especially the Sister, upon the said Supply, for her Support; and indeed, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> had said rashly, that she wou'd not take any more Notice of the Sister, and wou'd leave her to perish, as above, yet it was neither in my Na∣ture, or <HI>Amy</HI>'s either, much less was it my Design; and therefore I resolv'd to leave the Management of what I had reserv'd for that Work, with my faithful QUA∣KER, but how to direct her to manage them, was the great Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had told them in so many Words, That she was not their Mother, but that she was the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> that carried them to their Aunt's; that she and their Mo∣ther went over to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> to seek their Fortune, and that there good Things had befallen them; and that their Mother was very rich and happy; that she <HI>(Amy)</HI> had married in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but being now a Widow, and resolving to come over to <HI>England,</HI> their Mother had obliged her to enquire them out, and do for them as she had done; and that now she was resolved to go back to the <HI>Indies</HI> again; but that she had Orders to do very handsomely by them; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> told them, She had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a-piece for them, upon Condition that they proved sober, and married suitably to themselves, and did not throw themselves away up∣on Scoundrels.</P>
<P>The good Family in whose Care they had been, I had resolved to take more than ordinary Notice of; and
<PB N="344" REF="342"/>
<HI>Amy,</HI> by my Order, had acquainted them with it, and obliged my Daughters to promise to submit to their Government, as formerly, and to be ruled by the ho∣nest Man, as by a Father and Counsellor; and engaged him to treat them as his Children; and to oblige him effectually to take Care of them, and to make his old Age comfortable both to him and his Wife, who had been so good to the Orphans, I had ordered her to set∣tle the other 2000 <HI>l. that is to say,</HI> the Interest of it, which was 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, upon them, to be theirs for both their Lives; but to come to my two Daughters after them. This was so just, and was so prudently managed by <HI>Amy,</HI> that nothing she ever did for me, pleased me better. And in this Posture, leaving my two Daughters with their ancient Friend, and so coming away to me, <HI>(as they thought to the</HI> East-Indies) she had prepared every Thing in order to her going over with me to <HI>Holland;</HI> and in this Posture that Matter stood when that unhappy Girl, <HI>who I have said so much of,</HI> broke in upon all our Measures, <HI>as you have heard;</HI> and by an Obstinacy never to be conquer'd or pacify'd, either with Threats or Perswasions, pursued her Search after me <HI>(her Mother) as I have said,</HI> till she brought me even to the Brink of Destruction, and wou'd, in all Probability, have traced me out at last, if <HI>Amy</HI> had not by the Violence of her Passion, and by a Way which I had no Knowledge of, and indeed abhor'd, put a Stop to her; of which I can∣not enter into the Particulars here.</P>
<P>However, notwithstanding this, I could not think of going away, and leaving this Work so unfinished as <HI>Amy</HI> had threatned to do, and for the Folly of one Child, to leave the other to starve; or to stop my determined Bounty to the Good Family I have mentioned. So, <HI>in a Word,</HI> I committed the finishing it all to my faith∣ful Friend the QUAKER, to whom I communicated as much of the old Story as was needful to empower her to perform what <HI>Amy</HI> had promised; and to make her talk so much to the Purpose, as one employed more remotely than <HI>Amy</HI> had been, needed to do.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="343"/>
To this Purpose, she had first of all a full Possession of the Money; and went first to the honest Man and his Wife, and settled all the Matter with them; when she talk'd of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> she talk'd of her as one that had been empower'd by the Mother of the Girls, in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> but was obliged to go back to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and had settled all sooner, if she had not been hinder'd by the obsti∣nate Humour of the other Daughter; that she had left In∣structions with her for the rest; but that the other had affronted her so much, that she was gone away without doing any Thing for her; and that now, if any Thing was done, it must be by fresh Orders from the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I need not say how punctually my new Agent acted; but which was more, she brought the old Man and his Wife, and my other Daughter, several Times to her House, by which I had an Opportunity, <HI>being there on∣ly as a Lodger, and a Stranger,</HI> to see my other Girl, which I had never done before, since she was a little Child.</P>
<P>The Day I contriv'd to see them, I was dress'd up in a Quaker's Habit, and look'd so like a Quaker, that it was impossible for them, who had never seen me before, to suppose I had never been any Thing else; also my Way of talking was suitable enough to it, for I had learned that long before.</P>
<P>I have not Time here to take Notice what a Surprize it was to me to see my Child, how it work'd upon my Affections; with what infinite Struggle I master'd a strong Inclination that I had to discover myself to her; how the Girl was the very Counterpart of myself, on∣ly much handsomer; and how sweetly and modestly she behav'd; how on that Occasion I resolv'd to do more for her, than I had appointed by <HI>Amy, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis enough to mention here, that as the settling this Affair made Way for my going on Board, notwithstand∣ing the Absence of my old Agent <HI>Amy;</HI> so however, I left some Hints for <HI>Amy</HI> too, for I did not yet despair of my hearing from her; and that if my good QUAKER
<PB N="346" REF="344"/>
should ever see her again, she should let her see them; wherein particularly ordering her to leave the Affair of <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> just as I had done, in the Hands of my Friend, she should come away to me, upon this Condi∣tion nevertheless, that she gave full Satisfaction to my Friend the QUAKER, that she had not murdered my Child; for if she had, <HI>I told her,</HI> I would never see her Face more. But, notwithstanding this, she came over afterwards, without giving my Friend any of that Satis∣faction, or any Account that she intended to come over.</P>
<P>I can say no more now, but that, <HI>as above,</HI> being ar∣rived in <HI>Holland,</HI> with my Spouse and his Son, <HI>formerly mentioned,</HI> I appeared there with all the Splendor and Equipage suitable to our new Prospect, <HI>as I have already observed.</HI></P>
<P>Here, after some Years of Flourishing, and outward∣ly happy Circumstances, I fell into a dreadful Course of Calamities, and <HI>Amy</HI> also; the very Reverse of our former good Days; the Blast of Heaven seem'd to fol∣low the Injury done the poor Girl, by us both; and I was brought so low again, that my Repentance seem'd to be only the Consequence of my Misery, as my Mi∣sery was of my Crime.</P>
