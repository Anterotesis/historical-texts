<P>THE <HI>Malade Imaginaire</HI> of Moliere first sug∣gested the idea of <HI>The Spleen,</HI> the Author of which has however deviated without scruple from his admirable original. The readers of the agreeable essays under the title of <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iler,</HI> will also discover some <HI>traits</HI> of D'Oyley in that writer's description of Drugget's retirement, as well as some features of Rubrick in his charact<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler. Any other <HI>gleanings,</HI> as the Prologue neatly terms them, I do not recollect, except that I have before exhibited a young Cantabrigian at Newmarket, in one of the Numbers of The Connoisseur; in which papers, as well as other popular essays, there are also frequent allusions to the short excursions and suburb villas of our citizens.—It has (I am told) been asserted in one of our daily prints—the <HI>Gazetteer,</HI> or <HI>Gar∣retteer</HI>— I forget the name of it—that for the idea of <HI>the Noon-Post</HI> I am indebted to my deceased friend BONNEL THORNTON. No body was more ca∣pable of giving excellent hints; there was nobody whose hints I would more readily have embraced, or more chearfully acknowledged. But the asser∣tion is totally false. It is not the first time that my enemies have paid me a compliment they did not in∣tend, by ascribing my feeble productions to more eminent writers. I will endeavour not to be vain of their censures; though perhaps they will think me so, in adopting the words of Terence on the occasion.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>NAturam intueri &amp; sequi</HI> is e∣qually the province of the dramatist and physician; and could I trace the windings of the human heart with half that skill and sagacity that you have applied to the disorders of the body, I should, by mere force of talent, secure to myself a re∣spectable seat in the college. Even among regulars, there is often found a tincture of empiricism, not un∣worthy ridicule: for there are too few who, like you, have honesty and fortitude to confess the imper∣fection of art, and the uncertainty of science. There is a quackery in letters and morals also, as well as in medicine; but your knowledge and experience, your humanity and good
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
sense, are not more distinguishing marks of your character, than your sovereign contempt for imposture in every situation. To this noble plainness of manners, this integrity of heart, permit me to make an humble offering, and to seize this occasion of publishing the senti∣ments of esteem and affection that I have long entertained for you, and with which I remain,</P>

<L>Yet <HI>you</HI> will have them, when their date is o'er,</L>
<L>And <HI>Prologue, Prologue,</HI> still your honours roar;</L>
<L>Till some such dismal phiz as mine comes on,</L>
<L>Ladies and Gentlemen indeed there's none,</L>
<L>The <HI>Prologue, Author, Speaker,</HI> all are dead and gone!</L>
<L>These reasons have some weight, and stop the rout;</L>
<L>You clap—I smirk—and thus go cringing out;</L>
<L>"While living call me, for your pleasure use me;</L>
<L>"Should I tip off—I hope you'll then excuse me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So much for Prologues—and now enter Farce.</L>
<L>Shall I a scene, I lately heard, rehearse?</L>
<L>The Place, the Park; the Dramatis Personae,</L>
<L>Two female wits, with each a maccaroni.</L>
<L>Prithee, Lord Flimsey—what's this thing at Drury?</L>
<L>This <HI>Spleen?</HI> 'This low, damn'd low, Ma'am I assure ye,</L>
<L><HI>Ce'st Vrai mi Lor!</HI>—we now feel no such evil,</L>
<L>Never are haunted with a vapourish devil.</L>
<L>In pleasures round <HI>we</HI> whirl it from the brain,</L>
<L><HI>You</HI> rattle it away with <HI>Seven's the Main!</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>upper</HI> life we have no Spleen or gall;</L>
<L>And as for other Life, it is no life at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What can I say in our poor Bard's behalf?</L>
<L>He hopes that <HI>lower life</HI> may make you laugh,</L>
<L>May not a trader who shall business drop,</L>
<L>Quiting at once his old accustom'd shop,</L>
<L>In Fancy thro' a course of pleasures run,</L>
<L>Retiring to his seat at <HI>Islington?</HI></L>
<L>And of false dreams of happiness brim-full,</L>
<L>Be at his Villa, miserably dull?</L>
<L>Wou'd he not Islington's fine air forego,</L>
<L>Cou'd he again be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoak'd in Butcher Row?</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>In showing cloth, renew his former pleasure,</L>
<L>Surpass'd by none, but that of clipping measure.</L>
<L>The master of <HI>this shop</HI> too seeks repose,</L>
<L>Sells off his stock in trade his verse and prose,</L>
<L>His daggers, buskins, thund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, lightning, and old clothes.</L>
<L>Will he in rural shades find ease and quiet?</L>
<L>Oh no! —</L>
<L>He'll sigh for Drury, and seek peace in riot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature of yore prevail'd thro' human kind,</L>
<L>To <HI>low</HI> and <HI>middle</HI> life, she's now confin'd.</L>
<L>'Twas there the choicest dramatists have sought her;</L>

<P>HOW tedious is the time, when expectation obliges us to mark its progress! Here have I been near an hour and an half, watching the dial of St. Paul's, and counting the minutes, in hopes of news from my Eliza. It is now almost noon; where can this rascal of mine be loitering? Oh; here he is!</P>

<P>And I thought my Eliza was with him?</P>

<P>So she was, Sir—Father and daughter both in the country—that is, if you call Islington out of town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Islington?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Servant.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, Islington. Her father, Mr. Rubrick, has taken lodgings at Islington Spa for the summer, Sir; and Madam Eliza attended him there. And is now returned to fetch Mrs. Rubrick from Paternoster-Row, to join her husband at Isling∣ton.</P>

<P>My Eliza just come to town! My arrival is critical.

Suppose I go and reconnoitre a little! <STAGE><HI>going</HI></STAGE> Jack Rubrick!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JACK RUBRICK.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! Tom Merton in England? and in London too? My old friend and school-fel∣low! how do you? your hand, Tom! I did not think you had been in our hemisphere. A commis∣sion took you from us in the middle of Westmin∣ster college; and how has it disposed of you since, Tom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For three years, my dear Jack, I have been stationed at Gibraltar, from whence I have been returned, with the rest of the regiment, little more than so many months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So you have been studying the Tacticks at the Hercules Pillars, while I have been cudgelling the Mathematicks at Cambrigde. How we diverge, like rays, from the same centre! We walk through life together indeed, but seem hitherto, like parallel lines, destined never to meet. But I am heartily glad of this encounter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I as heartily.—But by your boots and your language, Jack, I should imagine you to be just fresh from the University.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit it. I am so.—Not immediately though—for I flew off in a tangent the beginning of last week to Newmarket. It was the second Spring meeting; and I chose to take the Sun's altitude on the course every day, make a few observations (during the heats) upon matter and motion, with as many calculations, as a Lot∣tery-Office-keeper, on the Doctrine of Chances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What a hard student! But was there good sport?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sport! you talk as if you were speak in gof a common country race. They never think of port. It is all <HI>business</HI> at Newmarket, man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, was the business good, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Many thought excellent; but it was quite in an inverse <HI>ratio</HI> to me, Tom! Fourscore <HI>minus,</HI> I promise you. My quarter's allowance, which I had just received at Lady-day, (thirty guineas!) gone.—Reduced to sell my little horse <HI>Phosphorus</HI> for thirty more! Gone. And I was obliged to give a promissory note for twenty more.— So that if you understand Algebra but half so well as I do, Tom, you will find by all the powers of numbers, that I was just eighty guineas a loser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thirty and thirty, and twenty! Four∣score exactly, Jack! I have just so much arithme∣tick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The woods were all hollow in my favour too! Were you ever at Newmarket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ill tell you then—It was a four mile heat on the long course—a match between Pan∣theon, Jubilee, Duenna, and Gabrielli!—At first going off they kept pretty even together; Jubilee and Duenna, Pantheon and Gabrielli, cheek by jowl, and formed a kind of Parallelogram.—When they came to describe a circle on the Round Course, you might almost as soon have squared the circle, as have told which would be the winner. Then away they went, whip and spur, through the Devil's ditch, like the Devil himself!—Coming up Choakjade, Pantheon lagged behind. Gabrielli, though some thought her touched in the wind, got a-head of the other two; and she before, with Jubilee and Duenna abrest of each other, formed an equilateral triangle—A thousand pound to a china orange on Gabrielli! when all of a sudden, with a damned eccentrick motion, she made an acute angle on the wrong side of the post—Jubilee started and stumbled—but by the bye, I believe his ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
played booty—Duenna won the stakes, and the knowing ones were all taken in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And poor Jack Rubrick into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Poor indeed, Tom! I discovered as absolute a <HI>vacuum</HI> in my breeches pockets, as in those of a heathen philosopher: I would fain have been among the red ribbands and black legs at <HI>Hell</HI> in the evening, and tried my luck with tossing the <HI>cubes</HI> about—but not a single guinea left to bribe my fortune, or take me off the course. By good luck, Frank Whip of Clare Hall was there, and being on a scheme to London, brought me up to town in his phaeton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what's your business here, Jack?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Partly to get a fresh recruit from Old Square-toes. I might have made out a list of mathematical books for a supply—but as the Devil will have it, he sells books himself, you know.—So there's no hopes in that quarter—but I was obliged to come up, in order to attend the marriage of my sister Eliza.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The marriage of your sister Eliza! to whom, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To old D'Oyley, the rich draper, that kept the three sheep behind St. Clement's—did you never hear of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have. But Eliza will never be his wife, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but she will though! He may like her, and she not like him, it is true, Tom. There may be all the powers of attraction and re∣pulsion between them, perhaps. But they'll be married within these ten days, for all that, my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>

Mrs Jenkins of the Three Blue Balls, Mrs. Rummer and family from the King's Arms, and several other people of condition to be there this season!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, Sir? Do you think it necessary for a physician to appear like an undertaker? Thank Heaven I am the first of the faculty. Sir, that made it proper and fashionable in this country for a phy∣sician to look like a gentleman. I have spent a good deal of time abroad, Sir; and even our Clergy, when abroad, moult their feather'd grizzles, cast their pudding sleeves, and put on white stockings, long swords, and bag-wigs, Sir.</P>

<P>Ah! some of them are coming pretty near the mark at home, Doctor.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have had the honour of travelling, Sir, and I thought it right to adopt the modes, as well as science, of the several countries I visited. For∣merly, the grave owls of the College, with their clouted cravats, hay-cock perukes, clouded canes, and bolus buttons, seemed to think no man qualified to prescribe a cathartick or emetick, that did not look, as if he had just taken one himself.—And their practice was as absurd, as their figures were ridicu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Doctor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, Sir. A consultation of mere home-bred physicians, is worse than an epide∣mick distemper. The plague, or the <HI>influenza</HI> is nothing to it.—Your case for instance! By your ap∣pearance, I should judge your case to have been wholly mistaken.

<P>Plain food, no wine, and no pickles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Wrong, wrong, all wrong! Your tem∣perament being too low, nature plainly directs that you should live very high. A bottle of wine would operate as the most excellent cordial, and the sti∣mulation of pickles would both create and strengthen the appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be more reasonable. I must alter my whole regimen, and enrich my blood with good eating and drinking—take chocolate for break∣fast, a chearful glass for dinner, and make a hearty supper.—How many grains of salt may I put to an egg, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not by me, Mr. D'Oyley. Consult your own understanding, Sir! How should smoke, that preserves a flitch of bacon, injure you; or salt, that keeps a ham from putrefaction, hurt the tone of your stomach? Cookery indeed renders many things unwholesome, that are not so in themselves. How is your meat drest, Sir?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thoroughly done, always—for else, the Doctors tell me, that the juices would not assi∣milate.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For which reason they leave the food without any juices at all. Without them, Sir, in∣stead of beef or mutton, you might as well eat mo∣hogany. In Abyssinia, where a state of nature pre∣vails, a raw rasher from a live ox is wholesome and

<P>Pernicious, Doctor! I always under∣stood bread to be the wholesomest food in the world.</P>

<P>A vulgar error, Sir! Pap, mere pap, kills nine-tents of the children that die in the Foundling Hospital. Bread and milk swell the bills of mortality.

<P>Stay, Mrs. Rubrick! Stay, sister Ta∣bitha! I question the truth of this story. What signifies an idle report? Are not there a thousand things paragraphed for facts one day, and para∣graphed for dimned lies the very day after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Aspin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't trust to that, Mr. Rubrick! The fact, I fear, is indisputable. The very maid whom they trusted, has betrayed them, and confest that <HI>the Doctor there,</HI> has more than once slept all night in your daughters chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye it's too plain; I shake as if I were in an ague; three months of the Cold Bath will not bring me righ again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pslm! this is a mere English complaint. Abroad, no case is more common, or less alarming —I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll set you right, I warrant you, Mr. D'Oyley!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Mr. D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Oyley, I shall insist on your fulfilling your contract.—The penalty, you
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
know, is pretty considerable—and I hope not to be obliged, by force of law, to compel you to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So; this affair will be the death of me. My health depends on my peace of mind; and that is sure of being destroyed, either by a wife, or a law-suit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where is this rascal, that pre∣tends to have dishonoured my sister? I'll drive him to the center.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My center is here, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ELIZA <HI>and</HI> MERTON.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr. and Mrs. Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Eliza! and Mr. Merton here!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir; yes, Madam, I am here; when Eliza's life, fortune, or reputation are in dan∣ger, it is impossible for me to keep at a distance. She now lies under a most vile and false calumny, and he is a rascal that dares assert or insinuate the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, say I, Sir! Woe be to the man that da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es impeach her honour! I have always been a staunch friend to the sex, and shall most certainly be true to this lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Eliza.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been more true to myself, Sir.— Believe me. Madam; believe me, Aunt; believe me, Mr. D'Oyley, there is no truth in this infa∣mous story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Too much, I am afraid, Miss Eliza! You never paid the least attention to me before; and your earnestness now only serves to confirm my suspicions. Would you marry her yourself, Doc∣tor? that is the surest way of making her fame whole again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For particular reasons, best known to myself and the young lady, I must beg to be ex∣cused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Damnation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Olyey.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>See there! Can you wonder at my hesitation, Mr. Rubrick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I look upon the Doctor to be more dangerous as a physician, than a gallan; and so little do I credit this scandal, that with Mr. and Mrs. Rubrick's consent, I am willing to accept of her hand immediately.—What say Eliza, and Mr. and Mrs. Rubrick, to my proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Eliza.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am all confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I am all distraction. As to your offer, there's something handsome enough—but Mr. D'Oyley's contract—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, Mr. Rubrick, I'll endea∣vour to make you easy. For the sake of health, and happiness, and peace of mind, I am content to forfeit half the penalty, and to settle it on the young couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Aspin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll throw in the other half, as a blessing to my god-daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's generous I must confess—ge∣nerous on both sides. What day shall we fix for the ceremony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is needless to fix any day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The ceremony is already over. We have been married these three weeks. And I con∣sider the Doctor as my best friend, in having been the means of obtaining your consent to ratify our union.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am a fast friend to all this good company, Mr. Rubrick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Friend! And pray who the devil are you, friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An old acquaintance of your's, I assure you, Mr. Rubrick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An acquaintance of mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir. Look me full in the face, and see if you don't recollect me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>Looking stedfastly</HI></STAGE>Eh! Let me see! Why, sure it can't be—i'faith, but it is tho'—a fe∣male Hippocrates, by Jupiter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! the Doctor a woman? Have I been bled, and blistered, and purged, and pickled, by a female physician?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, Sir!—A woman well-known to your family, Mr. Rubrick.—And you must own, gentlemen, that I boast less than modern gallants are apt to do, and am more careful of the honour of the ladies than gallants are apt to be, when I avow the charge of being my sweet Eliza's bedfel∣low.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, so! Mr. Merton's cousin, Laetitia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Aspin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Laetitia, Mr. Rubrick: and I'll fairly own, that I joined with Mrs. Madcap there, and the rest of the young folks, in concerting this scheme, to cure my friend D'Oyley both of his spleen and inclination to matrimony; and by that means to reconcile you to your daughter and son in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I forgive you. I forgive them too. I am so pleased with this unexpected turn, and this clear proof of my daughter's innocence, that I can forgive any thing. I'll send a flamming pa∣ragraph of their wedding to all the news-papers—but the Noon-Post shall have the first of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think I ought to forgive them too, sister Tabby?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Tabitha.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; all's well that ends well, say I, sister Rubrick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, here has been a change of system, to be sure, aunt Tabitha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To complete the change, let me throw in my new resolutions. For your sake, Miss Eliza, I shall hereafter wave all thoughts of matrimony; and for yours, Madam Doctor, <STAGE><HI>to Laetitia</HI></STAGE> I shall for the future, be more diffident of <HI>nostrums</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="38"/>
physicians. Mr. Rubrick must henceforth expect my custom for books, rather than medicines; or if he chuses to weave my story and character into a farce or a novel, I should be happy to hear it af∣forded an hour's entertainment, and was repeated nightly, as A CURE FOR THE SPLEEN.</P>
