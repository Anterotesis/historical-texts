<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LANGBANE, JACOB, and the rest of the Stage Historians, who have hitherto appeared in Print, abounding with Errors as well omissive as commissive; we flattered ourselves that a more regular and exact Account of <HI>English</HI> Drama∣tic Writers, could scarce fail of a Favourable reception from the Publick.</P>
<P>Prompted by this we have made the following At∣tempt; but with what Success, we submit to the Judgment of others. Thus much however we can alledge, that no Pains on our Part have been wanting, no Means of In∣formation in our Power untried; having, before we set forward in the Work, laid in a considerable Fund of Theatrical History. For a great Part of this, indeed, we must acknowledge ourselves indebted to Mr. <HI>Chet∣wood</HI>, whose extensive Knowledge in these Matters is not to be questioned; having been for many Years employed as Prompter and Manager to the Theatres both of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin</HI>; and who, from a State of Affluence, is now reduced to almost a State of Indigence, and has nothing in view but the melancholy Prospect of ending the Residue of Life within the Walls of a Prison, where Ill-Fortune has already thrown him.</P>
<P>The Reader is desired to observe, that in the Arrange∣ment of the several Plays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a Chronological order has been observed, wherein Regard is always had to the earliest Dates▪ As for the Writers to whose Works no Dates have been prefixed, as Necessity oblig'd us to have Recourse to Conjecture, 'tis hoped the Reader will rest satisfied, as it was impossible, perhaps, to furnish a more satisfactory Account.</P>

<L>Candidus imperti; si non his utere mecum.

<P>Having said thus much, we now proceed to an Ac∣count of the Rise and Progress of the <HI>English</HI> Stage, for which the Reader is obliged to the Labours of an In∣genious Writer now living.</P>
<P>It is generally imagined, that the <HI>English</HI> Stage rose later than the rest of its Neighbours. Those in this Opi∣nion will, perhaps, wonder to be told of Theatrical En∣tertainments almost as early as the Conquest; and yet nothing is more certain, if you will believe an honest Monk, one <HI>William Stephanides</HI> or <HI>Fitz-Stephen</HI>, in his <HI>Descriptio Nobilissimae Civitatis Londoniae</HI>, who writes thus;
<Q>“<HI>London</HI>, instead of common Interludes belong∣ing to the Theatre, has Plays of a more holy Sub∣ject; Representations of those Miracles which the holy Confessors wrought, or of the Sufferings wherein ”the glorious Constancy of the Martyrs did appear.</Q>
This Author was a Monk of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, who wrote in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. and died in that of <HI>Richard</HI> I. 1191: And as he does not mention these Representati∣ons as Novelties to the People, (for he is describing all the common Diversions in use at that time) we can hardly fix them lower than the Conquest. And this, we believe, is an earlier Date than any other Nation of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> can produce for their Theatrical Representations. About 140 Years after this, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was ordained by Act of Parliament, that a Company of Men called <HI>Vagrants</HI>, who had made Masquerades thro' the whole City, should be whipt out of <HI>London</HI>, because they represented scandalous Things in the little Alehouses, and other Places where the Populace assem∣bled. What the Nature of these scandalous Things were, we are not told; whether lewd and obscene, or im∣pious and profane; but we should rather think the for∣mer, for the Word <HI>Masquerades</HI> has an ill Sound, and, we believe, they were no better in their Infancy than at
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
present. 'Tis true, the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> were soon af∣ter this Period made very free with all over <HI>Europe</HI>, being represented in so stupid and ridiculous a manner, that the Stories of the <HI>New Testament</HI> in particular, were thought to encourage <HI>Libertinism</HI> and Infidelity. In all Probability therefore the Actors last mentioned were of that Species called <HI>Mummers</HI>; these were wont to stroll about the Country dress'd in an antick Manner, danc∣ing, mimicking, and shewing Postures. This Custom is still continued in many Parts of <HI>England</HI>; but it was formerly so general, and drew the common People so much from their Business, that it was deemed a very pernicious Custom: And as these <HI>Mummers</HI> always went masked and disguised, they but too frequently encouraged themselves to commit violent Outrages, and were guilty of many lewd Disorders. However, as bad as they were, they seem to be the true original Comedi∣ans of <HI>England</HI>; and their Excellence altogether consisted, as that of their Successors does in part still, in Mimick∣ry and Humour.</P>
<P>In an Act of Parliament made the 4th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. mention is made of certain <HI>Wastors, Master-Ri∣mours, Minstrels</HI>, and other Vagabonds, who infested the Land of <HI>Wales; And it is enacted, that no</HI> Master-Rimour, Minstrel, <HI>or other Vagabond, be in any wise sustained in the Land of</HI> Wales, <HI>to make Commoiths or Gatherings upon the People there</HI>. What these <HI>Master-Ri∣mours</HI> were, which were so troublesome in <HI>Wales</HI> in parti∣cular, we cannot tell; possibly they might be the degene∣rate Descendants of the antient Bards. It is also difficult to determine what is meant by their making <HI>Commoiths</HI>. The Word signifies, in <HI>Welch</HI>, any District, or Part of a Hundred or Cantred, containing about one Half of it; that is, 50 Villages; and might possibly be made Use of by these <HI>Master-Rimours</HI> when they had fixed upon a Place to act in, and gave Intimation thereof for ten or twelve Miles round, which is a Circuit that will take in about 50 Villages. And that this was commonly done, appears from <HI>Carew</HI>'s Survey of <HI>Cornwall</HI>, which was wrote in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
time. Speaking of the Diversions of the People,
<Q>“The <HI>Guary Miracle</HI>, (says he) in <HI>English</HI> a Miracle Play, is a kind of Interlude compiled in <HI>Cornish</HI>, out of some Scripture History. For representing it they raise an Amphitheatre in some open Field, having the Diameter of its inclosed Plain, some forty or fifty Foot. The Country People flock from all Sides many Miles off, to see and hear it; for they have therein Devils and Devices to delight as well the ”Eye as the Ear.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Carew</HI> has not been so exact, as to give us the Time when these <HI>Guary Miracles</HI> were exhibited in <HI>Cornwall</HI>; but, by the manner of it, the Custom seems to be very antient.</P>
<P>The Year 1378 is the earliest Date we can find, in which express mention is made of the Representation of Mysteries in <HI>England</HI>. In this Year the Scholars of <HI>Paul</HI>'s School presented a Petition to <HI>Richard</HI> II. pray∣ing his Majesty
<Q>“to prohibit some unexpert People from presenting the History of the Old Testament, to the great Prejudice of the said Clergy, who have been at great Expence in order to represent it publickly at ”<HI>Christmas</HI>.</Q>
About twelve Years afterwards, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1390, the Parish-Clerks of <HI>London</HI> are said to have played Interludes at <HI>Skinners Well, July</HI> 18, 19, and 20th. And again, in 1409, the tenth Year of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. they acted at <HI>Clerkenwell</HI> (which took its Name from this Custom of the Parish Clerks acting Plays there) for eight Days successively, a Play concerning the Crea∣tion of the World, at which were present most of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom. These Instan∣ces are sufficient to prove that we had the Mysteries here very early. How long they continued to be exhibited amongst us, cannot be exactly determined. This Pe∣riod one might call the dead Sleep of the Muses. And when this was over, they did not presently awake, but, in a kind of Morning Dream, produced the <HI>Mora∣lities</HI> that followed. However, these jumbled Ideas had some Shadow of Meaning. The Mysteries only
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
represented, in a senseless manner, some miraculous History from the Old or New Testament: But in these <HI>Moralities</HI> something of Design appeared, a Fable and a Moral; something also of Poetry, the Virtues, Vices, and other Affections of the Mind being frequently per∣sonified. But the Moralities were also very often con∣cerned wholly in religious Matters. For Religion then was every one's Concern; and it was no Wonder if each Party employed all Arts to promote it. Had they been in Use now, they would doubtless have turned as much upon Politicks. Thus, the <HI>New Custom</HI>, was certainly intended to promote the Reformation, when it was revived in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>. And in the more early Days of the Reformation, it was so common for the Partizans of the old Doctrines, (and per∣haps also of the new) to defend and illustrate their Te∣nets this Way, that in the 24th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in an Act of Parliament made for the promoting true Re∣ligion, we find a Clause restraining all Rimors or Players from singing in Songs, for playing in Interludes, any thing that should contradict the established Doctrines. It was also customary at this time to act these moral and religious Dramas in private Houses, for the Edification and Improvement, as well as the Diversion, of well-disposed Families: And for this Purpose the Appear∣ance of the Persons of the Drama were so disposed, as that five or six Actors might represent twenty Person∣ages.</P>
<P>What has been said of the Mysteries and Moralities, it is hoped will be sufficient just to shew the Reader what the Nature of them was. We should have been glad to be more particular; but where Materials are not to be had, the Building must be deficient. And, to say the Truth, a more particular Knowledge of these Things, any farther than as it serves to shew the Turn and Ge∣nius of our Ancestors, and the progressive Refinement of our Language, was so little worth preserving, that the Loss of it is scarce to be regretted. We proceed there∣fore with our Subject. The Muse might now be said
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
to be just awake when she began to trifle in the old In∣terludes, and aimed at something like Wit and Humour. And for these <HI>John Heywood</HI> the Epigrammatist undoubt∣edly claims the earliest, if not the foremost Place. He was Jester to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. but lived till the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign. <HI>Gammer Gur∣ton</HI>'s <HI>Needle</HI>, which is generally called our first Come∣dy, and not undeservedly, appeared soon after the In∣terludes: It is indeed altogether of a Comic Cast, and wants not Humour, tho' of a low and sordid kind. And now Dramatic Writers, properly so called, began to appear, and turn their Talents to the stage. <HI>Henry Parker</HI>, Son of Sir <HI>William Parker</HI>, is said to have wrote several Tragedies and Comedies in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and one <HI>John Hoker</HI>, in 1535, wrote a Comedy called <HI>Piscator</HI>, or the <HI>Fisher caught</HI>. Mr. <HI>Richard Ed∣wards</HI>, who was born in 1523, and in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign was made one of the Gentle∣men of her Majesty's Chapel, and Master of the Children there, being both an excellent Musician, and a good Poet, wrote two Comedies, one called <HI>Palaemon</HI> and <HI>Arcite</HI>, in which a Cry of Hounds, in hunting was so well imi∣tated, that the Queen and the Audience were extremely delighted: The other called <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pithias, the two faithfullest Friends in the World</HI>. After him came <HI>Thomas Sackville</HI>, Lord <HI>Buckhurst</HI>, and <HI>Tho∣mas Norton</HI>, the Writers of <HI>Gorboduc</HI>, the first Dra∣matic Piece of any Consideration in the <HI>English</HI> Language. Of these and some others, hear the Judg∣ment of <HI>Puttenham</HI>, in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>, wrote in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>;
<Q>“I think, says he, that for Tragedy the Lord of <HI>Buckhurst</HI>, and Maister <HI>Ed∣ward Ferrys</HI>, for such doings as I have seen of theirs, do deserve the highest Price: The Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI>, and Maister <HI>Edwards</HI> of her Majesty's Chapel, for ”Comedy and Interlude.</Q>
And in another Place he says,—
<Q>“But the principal Man in this Profession (of Poetry) at the same time, (<HI>viz. Edward</HI> VI.) was Maister <HI>Edward Ferrys</HI>, a Man of no less Mirth and
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
Felicity than <HI>John Heywood</HI>, but of much more Skill and Magnificence in his Metre, and therefore wrote for the most part to the Stage in Tragedy, and some∣times in Comedy or Interlude; wherein he gave the King so much good Recreation, as he had thereby ”many good Rewards.</Q>
Of this <HI>Edward Ferrys</HI>, so considerable a Writer, I can find no Remains, nor even the Titles of any Thing he wrote. After these follow∣ed <HI>John Lillie</HI>, famous in his Time for Wit, and hav∣ing greatly improved the <HI>English</HI> Language, in a Ro∣mance which he wrote, entitled <HI>Euphues and his En∣gland</HI>, or the <HI>Anatomy of Wit</HI>; of which it is said by the Publisher of his Plays,
<Q>“Our Nation are in his Debt for a new <HI>English</HI> which he taught them, <HI>Euphues and his England</HI> began first that Language. All our Ladies were then his Scholars, and that Beauty in Court who could not <HI>parle Euphuism</HI>, was as little ”regarded, as she which now there speaks not <HI>French</HI>.</Q>
This extraordinary Romance, so famous for its Wit, so fashionable in the Court of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, and which is said to have introduced so remarkable a Change in our Language, we have seen and read. It is an unnatu∣ral affected Jargon; in which the perpetual Use of Me∣taphors, Allusions, Allegories, and Analogies, is to pass for Wit; and stiff Bombast for Language. And with this Nonsense the Court of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (whose times afforded better Models for Stile and Composition, than almost any since) became miserably infected, and greatly helped to let in all the vile Pedantry of Lan∣guage in the following Reign. So much Mischief the most ridiculous Instrument may do, when he proposes to improve upon the Simplicity of Nature.</P>
<P>Though Tragedy and Comedy began now to lift up their Heads, yet they could do no more for some time than bluster and quibble; and how imperfect they were in all Dramatic Art, appears from an excellent Criticism of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI>, on the Writers of that Time. Yet they seem to have had a Disposition to do better had they known how, as appears by the several Efforts they used to lick the Lump into a Shape: For
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
some of their Pieces they adorned with dumb Shews, some with Choruses, and some they introduced and ex∣plained by an Interlocutor. Yet imperfect as they were, we had made a far better Progress at this Time than our Neighbours, the <HI>French:</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> indeed, by early Translations of the old Dramatic Writers, had arrived to greater Perfection, but we were at least up∣on a Footing with the other Nations of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>But now, as it were, all at once (as it happened in <HI>France</HI>, though in a much later Period) the true Drama received Birth and Perfection from the creative Genius of <HI>Shakespear, Fletcher</HI> and <HI>Johnson</HI>, whose several Cha∣racters are so well known, that it would be superfluous to say any more of them.</P>
<P>Having thus traced the Dramatic Muse thro' all her Characters and Transformations, till she had acquired a reasonable Figure, let us now return and take a more particular View of the Stage and the Actors. The first Company of Players we have any Account of in Histo∣ry, are the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s in 1578, mentioned be∣fore in Page iv. About twelve Years afterwards the Parish Clerks of <HI>London</HI> are said to have acted the My∣steries at <HI>Skinner's</HI> Well. Which of these two Compa∣nies may have been the earliest, is not certain; but as the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s are first mentioned, we must in Justice give the Priority to them. It is certain, the Mysteries and Moralities were acted by these two So∣cieties many Years before any other regular Companies appeared. And the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s continued to act long after Tragedies and Comedies came in vogue, even till the Year 1618, when a Comedy called <HI>Jack Drum's Entertainment</HI> was acted by them. Tis believ'd the next Company regularly established was, the Chil∣dren of <HI>The Royal Chapel</HI>, in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Reign, the Direction of which was given to Mr. <HI>Richard Edwards</HI> before mentioned: And some few Years afterwards, as the Subjects of the Stage be∣came more gay and ludicrous, a Company was form∣ed under the Denomination of <HI>The Children of the Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els</HI>. The Children of the Chapel and of the <HI>Revels</HI> became very famous, and all <HI>Lillie</HI>'s Plays and many of
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
<HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, <HI>Johnson</HI>'s, and others, were first acted by them. Nay, so great was their Vogue and Estimation, that the common Players, as may be gathered from a Scene in <HI>Hamlet</HI>, grew jealous of them. However, they served as an excellent Nursery for the Theatres, many who afterwards became approved Actors, being educated among them.</P>
<P>It is surprizing to consider what a number of Play∣houses were supported in <HI>London</HI> about this Time. From the Year 1570 to the Year 1629, when the Playhouse in <HI>White Friars</HI> was finished, no less than 17 Playhouses had been built. The Names of most of them may be collected from the Title Pages of old Plays. And as the Theatres were so numerous, the Companies of Players were in Proportion. Besides the Children of the Chapel, and of the Revels, we are told that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, at the Request of Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham</HI>, established in hand∣some Salaries twelve of the principal Players of that Time, who went under the Name of her Majesty's Co∣medians and Servants. But exclusive of these, many Noblemen retained Companies of Players, who acted not only privately in their Lord's Houses, but pub∣lickly under their License and Protection. Agreeable to this is the Account which <HI>Stow</HI> gives us —
<Q>“Players in former Times, says he, were Retainers to Noble∣men, and none had the Privilege to act Plays but such. So in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, many of the Nobility had Servants and Retainers who were Players, and went about getting their Livelihood that way. The Lord Admiral had Players, so had Lord <HI>Strange</HI>, that played in the City of <HI>London</HI>. And it was usual on any Gentleman's Complaint of them for indecent Reflections in their Plays, to have them put down. Thus once the Lord Treasurer signified to the Lord Mayor to have these Players of Lord Admiral and Lord <HI>Strange</HI> prohibited, at least for some time, because one Mr. <HI>Tilney</HI> had for some Reason disliked them. Whereupon the Mayor sent for both Com∣panies, and gave them strict Charge to forbear play∣ing till farther Orders. The Lord Admiral's Play∣ers obeyed; but the Lord <HI>Strange</HI>'s in a contemptu∣ous
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
Manner went to the <HI>Cross Keys</HI>, and play'd that Afternoon. Upon which the Mayor committed two of them to the <HI>Compter</HI>, and prohibited all playing for the future, till the Treasurer's Pleasure was far∣”ther known. This was in 1589.</Q>
And in another Part of his Survey of <HI>London</HI>, speaking of the Stage, he says,
<Q>“This which was once a Recreation, and used there∣fore now and then occasionally, afterwards by Abuse became a Trade and Calling, and so remains to this Day. In those former Days, ingenious Tradesmen, and Gentlemen's Servants, would sometimes gather a Company of themselves, and learn Interludes, to expose Vice, or to represent the noble Actions of our Ancestors. These they played at Festivals, in pri∣vate Houses, at Weddings or other Entertainments, but in Process of time it became an Occupation; and these Plays being commonly acted on Sundays and Festivals, the Churches were forsaken, and the Play∣houses thronged. Great Inns were used for this Purpose, which had secret Chambers and Places, as well as open Stages and Galleries. Here Maids and good Citizens Children were inveigled and allur'd to private and unmeet Contracts? here were publick∣ly utter'd popular and seditious Matters, unchaste, uncomely, and unshamefac'd Speeches, and many other Enormities. The Consideration of these Things occasioned in 1574, Sir <HI>James Hawes</HI> being Mayor, an Act of Common Council, wherein it was ordain∣ed, that no Play should be openly acted within the Liberty of the City, wherein should be uttered any Words, Examples, or Doings of any Unchastity, Se∣dition, or such like unfit and uncomely Matter, under the Penalty of five Pounds, and fourteen Days Im∣prisonment. That no Play should be acted till first perused and allowed by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; with many other Restrictions. Yet it was provided that this Act should not extend to Plays showed in private Houses, the Lodgings of a Nobleman, Citizen, or Gentleman, for the Cele∣bration of any Marriage, or other Festivity, and
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
where no Collection of Money was made from the Auditors. But these Orders were not so well observ∣ed as they should be; the lewd Matters of Plays en∣creased, and they were thought dangerous to Religion, the State, Honesty of Manners, and also for Infection in the time of Sickness. Wherefore they were af∣terwards for some Time totally suppressed. But upon Application to the Queen and the Councel they were again tolerated, under the following Restricti∣ons. That no Plays be acted on <HI>Sundays</HI> at all, nor on any other Holidays till after Evening Prayer. That no playing be in the Dark, nor continue any such Time, but as any of the Auditors may return to their Dwellings in <HI>London</HI> before Sunset, or at least before it be dark. That the Queen's Players only be tolerated, and of them their Number and certain Names to be notifyed in the Lord Treasurer's Let∣ters to the Lord Mayor, and to the Justices of <HI>Mid∣dlesex</HI> and <HI>Surry</HI>. And those her Players not to di∣vide themselves in several Companies. And that for breaking any of these Orders, their Toleration cease. But all these Prescriptions were not sufficient to keep them within due Bounds, but their Plays so abusive oftentimes of Virtue, or particular Persons, gave great Offence, and occasioned many Disturban∣ces: Whence they were now and then stopped and ”prohibited.</Q>
'Tis hop'd this long Quotation from <HI>Stow</HI> will be excused, as it serves not only to prove seve∣ral Facts, but to shew the Customs of the Stage at that Time, and the early Depravity of it. But that the Plays not only of that Age, but long before, were sometimes Personal Satires, appears from a Manu∣script Letter from Sir <HI>John Hallies</HI> to the Lord Chancellor <HI>Burleigh</HI>, found amongst some Papers belonging to the House of Commons, in which the Knight accuses his Lordship of having said several dis∣honourable Things of him and his Family, particularly that his Grandfather, who had then been dead seventy Years, was a Man so remarkably covetous, that the common Players represented him before the Court with great Applause.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="14"/>Thus we see the Stage no sooner began to talk than it grew scurrilous: And its first Marks of sense were seen in Ribaldry and Lasciviousness. This occasioned much Offence; the Zeal of the Pulpit, and the Gravi∣ty of the City equally concurred to condemn it. Ma∣ny Pamphlets were wrote on both Sides. <HI>Stephen Gos∣son</HI>, in the Year 1579, published a Book, entituled, <HI>The School of Abuse</HI>, or a <HI>pleasant Invective against Poets, Pipers, Players, Jesters, and such like Caterpillars of the Commonwealth</HI>; Dedicated to Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI>. He also wrote, <HI>Plays confuted in five Actions:</HI> Proving that they are not to be suffered in a <HI>Christian</HI> Commonwealth: Dedicated to Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham</HI>. The Defendants in this Controversy were <HI>Thomas Lodge</HI>, who wrote an old Play, called <HI>A Looking-Glass for</HI> London <HI>and</HI> En∣gland, and that voluminous Dramatic Writer <HI>Thomas Heywood</HI>.</P>
<P>But to proceed; The Stage soon after recovered its Credit, and rose to a higher Pitch than ever. In 1603, the first Year of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, a License was granted under the Privy Seal to <HI>Shakespear, Fletcher Burbage, Hemmings, Condel</HI>, and others, authorizing them to act Plays not only at their usual House, the <HI>Globe</HI> on the <HI>Bankside</HI>, but in any other Part of the King∣dom, during his Majesty's Pleasure. And now, as there lived together at this time many eminent Players, it may not be amiss just to set down what we can collect, which will be but very little, of the most considerable of them, with regard to their Talents and Abilities. And first,
<Q>“who is of more Report, says the Author of the <HI>Return from Parnassus</HI>, than <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will Kempe?</HI> He is not counted a Gentleman that knows not <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will Kempe:</HI> There's not a Country Wench that can dance <HI>Sellenger's Round</HI>, but can talk of <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will ”Kempe</HI>.</Q>
<HI>Burbage</HI> was the <HI>Betterton</HI>, and <HI>Kempe</HI> the <HI>Nokes</HI> of that Age. <HI>Burbage</HI> was the original <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the Third, and greatly distinguished himself in that Character: <HI>Kempe</HI> was inimitable in the Part of a Clown.
<Q>“He succeeded <HI>Tarleton</HI> (says <HI>Heywood</HI>) as well
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
in the Favour of her Majesty Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, as in the Opinion and good Thoughts of the general Audi∣”ence.</Q>
And <HI>Tarleton</HI>, says Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> in his Chro∣nicle, for the Part of a Clown, never had his Match, nor ever will have. The Epitaph of <HI>Burbage</HI> is preserved in <HI>Cambden</HI>'s <HI>Remains</HI>, and is only EXIT BURBAGE. The Epitaph of <HI>Tarleton</HI> is preserved by the same Historian as follows:
<Q><L>Hic situs est, cujus Vox, Vultus, Actio possit</L>
<L>Ex Heraclito reddere Democritum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next I shall mention is <HI>Edward Allen</HI>, the Found∣er of <HI>Dulwich Hospital</HI>; as famous for his Honesty, says <HI>Baker</HI>, as for his Acting; and two such Actors as he and <HI>Burbage</HI>, no Age must ever look to see again. He's a Man, says <HI>Heywood</HI> in his Prologue to the <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Malta</HI>,
<Q><L>Whom we may rank with (doing no more Wrong)</L>
<L><HI>Proteus</HI> for Shapes, and <HI>Roscius</HI> for a Tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>Hear also <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>, whose Praise is of more Weight, as it never was lightly bestowed:
<Q><L>If <HI>Rome</HI> so great, and in her wisest Age,</L>
<L>Fear'd not to boast the Glories of her Stage,</L>
<L>A skilful <HI>Roscius,</HI> and grave <HI>Aesop,</HI> Men,</L>
<L>Yet crown'd with Honours as with Riches, then,</L>
<L>Who had no less a Trumpet of their Name</L>
<L>Than <HI>Cicero,</HI> whose very Breath was Fame:</L>
<L>How can so great Example die in me,</L>

<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16"/><HI>Thomas Green</HI> was famous for performing the Part of a Clown with great Propriety and Humour; and from his excellent Performance of the Character of <HI>Bubble</HI>, in a Comedy written by Mr. <HI>John Cooke</HI>, the Author called it after his Name, <HI>Green</HI>'s <HI>Tu Quoque</HI>.
<Q>“There was not an Actor, says <HI>Heywood</HI>, of his Nature, in his Time, of better Ability in his Performance, more applauded by the Audience, of greater Grace at ”Court, or of more general Love in the City.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Hemmings</HI> and <HI>Condel</HI> were two considerable Actors in most of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, <HI>Johnson</HI>'s and <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Plays; the first in Tragedy, the last in Comedy: But they are better known for being the first Editors of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Works in Folio, in the Year 1623, seven Years after his Death.</P>
<P><HI>Lowin, Taylor</HI>, and <HI>Benfield</HI> are mentioned by <HI>Massen∣ger</HI> as famous Actors. In a Satire against <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>, are these two Lines:
<Q><L>Let <HI>Lowin</HI> cease, and <HI>Taylor</HI> scorn to touch</L>
<L>The loathed Stage, for thou hast made it such,</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Lowin</HI>, tho' something later than <HI>Burbage</HI>, is said to have been the first Actor of <HI>Hamlet</HI>, and also the origi∣nal <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth; from an Observation of whose acting it in his later Days, Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> con∣veyed his Instruction to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>.</P>
<P>And now the Theatreseems to have been at its Height of Glory and Reputation. Dramatic Authors abound∣ed, and every Year produced a Number of new Plays: Nay, so great was the Passion at this time for Shew or Representation, that it was the Fashion for the No∣bility to celebrate their Weddings, Birth-Days, and other Occasions of Rejoicing, with Masques and Inter-Indes, which were exhibited with surprising Expence; that great Architect <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> being frequently em∣ployed to furnish Decorations with all the Magnificence of his Invention. The King and his Lords, the Queen and her Ladies, frequently performed in these Masques at Court, and all the Nobility in their own private Houses: In short, no publick Entertainment was thought com∣plete without them; and to this Humour it is we owe; and perhaps 'tis all we owe it, the inimitable <HI>Masque at
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
Ludlow-Castle</HI>. For the same universal Eagerness after Theatrical Diversions continued during the whole Reign of King <HI>James</HI>, and great Part of <HI>Charles</HI> the First, till Puritanism, which had now gathered great Strength, more openly opposed them as wicked and diabolical. If we may judge of this Spirit from <HI>Prynne</HI>'s famous <HI>His∣trio-mastix</HI>, or <HI>Players Scourge</HI>, it appears to have been a Zeal much without Knowledge. This was a heavy Load of dull Abuse, published in 1633, against Plays, Players, and all who favoured them, by <HI>William Prynne</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Barrister of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn</HI>. The best way the Parties concerned, thought of, in answer to this Work, was to publish all the best old Plays that could then be found; so that many that had never yet seen the Light, were now brought forth. In short the Pa∣trons of the Stage for some short time prevailed; <HI>Prynne</HI>'s Book was deemed an infamous Libel both against the Church and State, against the Peers, Prelates, and Magistrates; and particularly against the King and Queen, where he says, that <HI>Princes dancing in their own Persons, was the Cause of their untimely Ends: That our</HI> English <HI>Ladies, shorn and frizzled Madams, had lost their Modesty: That Plays were the chief Delight of the Devil, and all that frequented them were damned</HI>. As he knew the King and Queen frequented them daily, this was thought to reflect on their Majesties. To all Musick he has an utter Antipathy, but Church-musick in par∣ticular, which he calls the <HI>bleating of brute Beasts</HI>; and says, <HI>the Choristers bellow the Tenor as if they were Ox∣en, bark a Counter-point like a Kennel of Hounds, roar a Treble as if they were Bulls, and grunt out a Base like a Parcel of Hogs</HI>. For these and many other Passages, it was ordered to be burnt by the Hands of the common Hangman: And his Sentence was, to be put from the Bar, excluded the Society of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn</HI>, and degrad∣ed by the University of <HI>Oxford</HI>; to stand in the Pillory at <HI>Westminster</HI> and in <HI>Cheapside</HI>, to lose an Ear at each Place, and stand with a Paper on his Head, declaring his Offence to be the publishing an infamous Libel against both their Majesties, and the Government; to be fined 5000<HI>l.</HI> and
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
suffer perpetual imprisonment. This Sentence was ex∣ecuted on him with great Rigour. But Puritanism, from a thousand concurrent Causes every Day gathering Strength, in a little time overturned the Constitution; and, amongst their many Reformations this was one, the total Suppression of all Plays and Playhouses.</P>
<P>Thus we have brought down this imperfect Essay on the Rise and Progress of the <HI>English</HI> Stage, to the Pe∣riod which was first intended: To pursue it farther, and take it up again at the Restoration, when a new Patent was granted to Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI>, would be need∣less; because from that time the Affairs of the Stage are tolerably well known. If what is done shall give any Satisfaction to the Curious, it is more than we have dared to promise ourselves from our own Sense of its great Imperfection; but we hope it will be considered, what slender Materials either the Ignorance of those Times, or the Injury of the following, have afforded us. We are as it were, the first Adventurers on these Disco∣veries, and it is not reasonable to expect more Perfec∣tion than is commonly found in the first Attempts of this Nature. All that we can say is, that we have thrown to∣gether 2 Number of Curious Circumstances on the Sub∣ject, that the Reader would seek for in vain elsewhere. And if the Novelty of them should excite the Curiosity of any Person of greater Abilities, or more Leisure, to make a stricter Enquiry into this Matter, he would certainly oblige us, and perhaps the Public.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Right Rev. Father in God <HI>JOHN BALE</HI> Bishop of <HI>OSSORY</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THIS learned <HI>Prelate</HI> was born at <HI>Covie</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI>, in 1495, and for his early and great Learning, made one of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> at <HI>Norwich</HI>; from thence he was entered a Student of <HI>Jesus College, Cambridge</HI>.</P>
<P>He was one of the first that embraced the Protes∣tant Religion; for which he was compelled to fly, to avoid the Persecution of <HI>Lee</HI> Bishop of <HI>York</HI>, and <HI>Stoke∣ly</HI> Bishop of <HI>London</HI>.</P>
<P>Being recalled by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. he was made Bishop of <HI>Ossory</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>, in 1552; but in six Months after <HI>Queen Mary</HI> ascended the Throne, he retired again, and in his Voyage to <HI>Brabant</HI> was taken by <HI>Pyrates</HI>; however he procured his ransom, and made <HI>Basil</HI> his Asylum, till once more recalled by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, when he rather chose a Prebendary of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>, than to sue for his former See of <HI>Ossory</HI>.</P>
<P>He died in <HI>November</HI> 1563, in the 68th Year of his Age. He was a severe Writer against the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>, and Author of the first Dramatic Pieces we find printed in the <HI>English</HI> Language. His Books are par∣ticularly

<P>Besides his Plays, he published a Book of 500 Epi∣grams, which are printed in a black Letter, 4to. with the Author's Picture at length, in 1573. His Dra∣matic Pieces are,

<HEAD>QUEEN ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>This illustrious Princess was not only a great En∣courager of Arts and Sciences, but also Mistress of the <HI>Greek, Latin, French, Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues; and, if we may credit the Authors of the <HI>Lives of illustrious Persons</HI>, she treated with the Ambassadors of different Courts in the several Languages of their Countries.</P>
<P>Her Reign was a continued Series of immor∣tal Events, which rendered her the darling of her People, and the admiration of Posterity: But as the History of her Life is already so well known, we shall only observe, that after a Reign of 44 Years, filled with the greatest Exploits, she died the 24th of <HI>March</HI> 1603. in the 70th Year of her Age.</P>

<HEAD>Sir PHILLIP SIDNEY.</HEAD>
<P>This illustrious Author was born at <HI>Penshurst</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> in 1554, and educated at <HI>Oxford</HI>, where he continued
<PB N="6" REF="30"/>
till seventeen years of Age, when he set out on the Tour of <HI>Europe</HI>, and at <HI>Paris</HI> narrowly escaped the horrid Massacre in 1572, by taking shelter in the House of the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> so highly prized his Merit and Abi∣lities, that she sent him Ambassador to <HI>Vienna</HI>, and to several other Courts in <HI>Germany</HI>; and when the Fame of his Valour became so extensive, that he was put in Election for the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI>, she refused to further his Advancement, not out of Emulation, but out of Fear to lose the Jewel of her Crown.</P>
<P>The Brevity we are confined to in this Work, will not permit us to enlarge on the Transactions of his Life. We shall therefore only add, that he was killed at the Battle of <HI>Zutphen</HI> in 1586, while he was mount∣ing the third Horse, having had two killed under him before.</P>
<P>He wrote one Dramatic Piece, which is printed with his Poems at the End of his <HI>Arcadia</HI>, and called</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Mr. WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>This immortal Author was the Son of Mr. <HI>John Shakespear</HI>, an eminent Dealer in Wool, and born in <HI>April</HI>, 1564. <HI>Stratford</HI> upon the River <HI>Avon</HI>, in the County of <HI>Warwick</HI>, is the indisputed Place of his Birth; and the Inhabitants have as much Reason to boast of his Nativity, as those of <HI>Smyrna</HI> for the Birth of <HI>Homer</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="33"/>He was educated at a Free-School in <HI>Stratford</HI>, where he acquired some Knowledge of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue; but his Father having a numerous Family, he was taken from thence at a Time when other Youths are beginning to prosecute their Studies; and being designed for the same Business with his Father, he was married very young to the Daughter of one Mr. <HI>Hathaway</HI>, a substantial Yeoman in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Stratford</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Way of Life he continued for some Time, till an Extravagance, which was too common among the young Fellows of that Time, forced him from his Trade and Country; this was no less than a frequent Practice of stealing Deer out of the Park of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Lucy</HI> of <HI>Cherlecot</HI> near <HI>Stratford</HI>, which brought on a rigorous Prosecution against him, obliged him to take refuge in <HI>London</HI>, and afterwards proved the Occasion of exerting one of the greatest <HI>Genius</HI>'s that ever was known in Dramatic Poetry.</P>
<P>His first Acquaintance with the Play-house is said to have commenced about this Time, where it is not un∣natural to suppose he was introduced by <HI>Thomas Green</HI> the Comedian, who we have learned, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn in the same Town with our Author. But as this is only Conjecture, we shall not think it improper to alledge Reasons for such a Presumption. In the Interlude of the <HI>Two Maids of Morelack, Green</HI>, who acted the Clown, enters singing and repeating Verses.</P>
<P>One of the Country Girls says to him, <HI>Why how now</HI> Tom! <HI>how longe have you beene in this Veine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Green</HI> answers,
<Q><L>I prattled Poesie in my Nurses Arms,</L>
<L>And born where late our Swan of <HI>Avon</HI> sung</L>
<L>In <HI>Avon's</HI> Streams, we both of us have lave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</L>
<L>And both come out together—</L></Q>
The other takes him up short,
<Q>He the sweetest <HI>Swan,</HI> and thou a cackling <HI>Goose</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="34"/>Though we have no remaining traces of his Excel∣lence in any Part, yet his admirable Wit, and the Na∣tural turn of it to the Stage, soon distinguished him, if not as an extraordinary Actor, at least as an excel∣lent Writer. He became one of the Directors in the Management of the Theatre, and by his Influence and Recommendation brought a Play of <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>'s on the Stage, which would otherwise have been laid aside by the Actors. In the <HI>Licence</HI> granted by King <HI>James</HI> the first, he was joined with <HI>Fletcher</HI> the Poet, and the Actors <HI>Burbage, Hemmings</HI>, and <HI>Condel</HI></P>
<P>Whatever the particular Times of his Writing were, the People of his Age could not but be highly pleased to see a <HI>Genius</HI> arise amongst them of so pleasurable, so rich a Vein, and so plentifully capable of furnishing their favourite Entertainments. Besides the Advanta∣ges of his Wit, he was himself a good natured Man, of great Sweetness of Manners, and a most agreeable Companion; so that it is no wonder he made himself acquainted with the best Conversations of those Times. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had several of his Plays acted before her, and gave him many gracious Marks of her Favour: What Grace soever the Queen conferred upon him, it was not to her only he owed the Fortune which the Reputation of his Wit made. He had the Honour to meet with many great and uncommon Marks of Fa∣vour and Friendship from the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI>, who at one Time gave him a Thousand Pounds, to enable him to go through with a Purchase which he heard he had a Mind to. A very extraordinary Boun∣ty at that Time.</P>
<P>As to his particular Friendships with private Men, every one who had a true Taste of Merit, and could dis∣tinguish Men, had generally a just Value and Esteem for him. His exceeding Candour and good Nature must certainly have inclined all the gentler Part of the World to love him as the Power of his Wit obliged Men of the most delicate Knowledge and polite Learning to admire h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Among these, was the in∣comparable Mr. <HI>Edmund Spenser</HI>, who speaks of him in
<PB N="11" REF="35"/>
his <HI>Tears of the Muses</HI>, not only with the Praises due to a good Poet, but even lamenting his Absence with the Tenderness of a Friend.</P>
<P><HI>Ben Johnson</HI> was too apt upon every Occasion to lessen the Value of our inimitable Author; and others of his Cotemporary Writers followed his Exam∣ple. <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> in their Comedy of the <HI>Scornful Lady</HI>, bring in <HI>Sir Roger</HI> the Parson to ridicule that Excellent Soliloquy spoken by <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the 2d. Act. <HI>To be, or not to be</HI>: in the following short Scene between <HI>Welford</HI> and the <HI>Parson</HI> in the 2d. Act of that Play.</P>
<P><HI>Wel</HI> But shall we see these Gentlewomen to Night?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Rog.</HI> Not till our Fellow Nicholas be deceas'd, that is asleep; for so the Word is taken, <HI>To sleep, to die, to die, to sleep</HI>. A very Figure, Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Wel.</HI> Can not you cast another for the Gentlewo∣men?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Rog.</HI> Not till the Man be in his Bed, his <HI>Bed</HI> his <HI>Grave</HI>, his <HI>Grave</HI> his <HI>Bed</HI>. The same Figure again, Sir.</P>
<P>There is a pleasing and well distinguished Va∣riety in those Characters, which he painted after Na∣ture. But what need we say more of this ex∣cellent Author, whose Genius is his best Herald, and whose Works the best Trumpet to proclaim it.</P>
<P>The latter Part of his Life was spent, as all Men of good Sense will wish theirs may be; in Ease, Retire∣ment, and the Conversation of his Friends. He had the good Fortune to gather an Estate equal to this Oc∣casion, and in that to his Wish; and is said to have spent some Years before his Death at his Native <HI>Strat∣ford</HI>. His pleasurable Wit and Good nature engaged him in the Acquaintance, and intituled him to the Friendship of the Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>He died in the Year 1616, in the 53d. Year of his Age, and was buried in the Chancel of the great Church at <HI>Stratford</HI>, where a Monument is placed in the Wall, with his Statue leaning on a Cushion, and this Inscrip∣tion:
<Q><PB N="12" REF="36"/>
<L>Ingenio Pylium, Genio <HI>Socratem,</HI> Arte <HI>Maronem,</HI></L>
<L>Terra tegit, Populus moeret, Olympus habet.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the Year 1740, a fine Statue of him, at full length, was set up in <HI>Westminster-Abby</HI>, designed by Mr. <HI>Kent</HI>, and executed by Mr. <HI>Schemakers</HI>, with this Inscription:
<Q>GULIELMO SHAKESPEARE ANNO POST MORTEM CXXIV. AMOR PUBLICUS POSUIT.</Q></P>
<P>And on the Scroll to which he points with his Fin∣ger:
<Q><L>The Cloud cap Towers,</L>
<L>The gorgeous Palaces,</L>
<L>The solemn Temples,</L>
<L>The great Globe itself,</L>
<L>Ye, all which it inherit,</L>
<L>Shall dissolve, and like the baseless Fabric</L>
<L>Of a Vision, leave not a Wreck behind.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Shak. Tempest.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Expence of this Monument was defrayed by the Money arising from two Benefit Plays given for that Purpose; one at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane</HI>, and the other at <HI>Covent-garden</HI>, the Players acting <HI>gra∣tis</HI>, and the Houses being crouded with Numbers who were desirous to pay this Tribute to the Memory of so great a Name.</P>
<P>We shall use our best Endeavours to place the Dra∣matic Works of our Author, in the order of Time they were acted. Many of them were exhibited on the Stage some Time before they were printed; and from the reputed Modesty of <HI>Shakespear</HI>, we may sup∣pose had pompous Titles given them by the Editors. In the Titles of these Plays, we chuse to follow the Orthography of the Times they were printed in, as we have done hitherto. His Plays are,

<HEAD>Mr. BEN JOHNSON.</HEAD>
<P>This great Poet was born in the City of <HI>Westminster</HI>, in 1574. He received the first Rudiments of his Edu∣cation at <HI>Westminster</HI> School under Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI>, from whence he removed to <HI>St. John's College Cambridge</HI>, and afterwards to <HI>Christ Church College</HI>, in <HI>Oxford:</HI> But his Mother having married a second Time, and not being in Circumstances to defray the Expence of an University Education, he was obliged to quit it, and betake himself to the Trade of a Bricklayer, which was that of his Step Father with whom he worked, and was employed under him, in helping to build, what is now the old Part of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn</HI>.</P>
<P>It is said that while he had the Trowel in his Hand, he had constantly a <HI>Horace</HI> in his Pocket, with which he diverted his leisure Hours, and improved his Genius; but not by this Author only, for he was assiduous in his Application to the Study of all the celebrated <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, and had a classical Reve∣rence for Antiquity. All the Designs of his Plays are great and noble, but he has been censured for the Roughness and Pedantry of his Style, as well as for the
<PB N="26" REF="50"/>
Roughness of his Humour, and too great an Opi∣nion of his own Merit.</P>
<P>Whether he first appeared upon the Stage as a Poet, or an Actor, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncertain, for he was both; the chief Part, we are told, he performed in his latter Capacity, was the Character of <HI>Morose</HI>, (a Picture it is said, which he drew from himself) in his own Play, called the <HI>Silent Woman</HI>; but tho' he was so much admired for his Writings, we hear but little of him as an Actor.</P>
<P>He succeeded MICHAEL DRAYTON as Poet Lau∣reat to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and died in 1637, in the 63d. Year of his Age. He was buried in <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI>, on the West side, near the Belfry, having at first on∣ly a flat Stone over his Grave, with this Inscription,</P>

<P>This celebrated Poet was born in <HI>London</HI>, in the Year 1618, had his Education at <HI>Westminster</HI> School, and <HI>Trinity</HI> College, <HI>Cambridge:</HI> But he commenced Poet, at the first Place, and wrote Verses in the 10th Year of his Age; this early inclination to Poetry, he tells us himself, was owing to his meeting with <HI>Spen∣ser's Fairy Queen</HI> by Chance, which he took great De∣light to read. He was a Person of great Integrity as well as Genius. He was brought, when young, into the Service of Lord <HI>St. Albans</HI>, and attended the Queen Mother to <HI>France</HI>, where he was serviceable to the Royal Family during their Exile. We need be the less circumstantial in our Account of him, because his Life is wrote by Dr. <HI>Sprat</HI>, Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI>, and prefixed to his Works. Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> for many Years expressed a great Desire of retiring from Business and living in the Country, which at last he found him∣self enabled to do; but what he looked upon as his Blessing, proved his Bane. For in a very little Time after he was settled there, at <HI>Chertsey</HI>, near the Banks of the <HI>Thames</HI>, staying one Day later in the Fields than was proper, attending his Workmen in some of their rural Employments, he caught such a Cold that was the Occasion of his Death.</P>
<P>He was buried in <HI>Westminster</HI> Abbey, where the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> erected a fine Monument to his Memory He wrote four Plays.</P>

<P>He was a short Time under the Care of Dr. <HI>Gill</HI>, a Person eminent for the Education of Youth; and from thence was transplanted to <HI>Christ-Church College, Cam∣bridge</HI>, where he commenced Master of Arts, and pursued his Studies with such Diligence, as caused such a Weakness in his Eyes, that at last deprived him of Sight.</P>
<P>To gratify a Desire he had of seeing Foreign Coun∣tries, he went to travel in 1623, and spent two Years in seeing all that was Curious in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>. At <HI>Paris</HI> he became acquainted with the Learned <HI>Grotius</HI> then Ambassador from <HI>Christina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI>; and at <HI>Rome</HI> was in some Danger for arguing against the Infallibility of the <HI>Pope</HI>, and the Tenets of the Ro∣mish Religion.</P>
<P>He returned at a Time when <HI>England</HI> was on the Point of being involved in a Civil War; and continu∣ed his course of Philosophical Studies till 1643, when he married the Daughter of <HI>Richard Powell</HI> of <HI>Forest-Hill</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>Sir CHARLES SEDLEY, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>This Accomplished Gentleman was descended from an ancient Family in the County of <HI>Kent</HI>.</P>
<P>He was married young, to a rich <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Lady, by whom he had one Daughter; but the Dif∣ference of Religion between them soon produced a Se∣paration, by consent of both Parties.</P>
<P>This Daughter was taken by the Mother, educated in her own Religion, and afterwards became Mistress to King <HI>James</HI> II. who created her Countess of <HI>Dor∣chester</HI>, and had by her the late Duchess of <HI>Bucking∣hamshire</HI>.</P>
<P>But as the Disgrace of the Daughter was not to be wiped of by the Honours conferred upon her, but ra∣ther rendered more conspicuous; it is not to be won∣dered at, that, at the <HI>Revolution</HI>, we find Sir <HI>Charles</HI> Zealous in the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, inso∣much that on his being reproved by the opposite Party, he replied, <HI>He hated Ingratitude, and since the King had been so kind in giving his Daughter the Title of</HI> Countess, <HI>to return the Obligation, he would by all means make the Princess of</HI> Orange, <HI>his Daughter, a</HI> Queen.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was a great Favourite at the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. He lived to a great Age; and, to the last, retained his Humour and Integrity. Besides a Volume of excellent Poems, he wrote the follow∣ing Plays.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN DRYDEN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>Poet Laureat to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. was descended from an ancient Family, in <HI>Northamp∣tonshire</HI>, Son of <HI>Erasmus Dryden</HI>, of <HI>Tichmarch</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
<PB N="83" REF="109"/>
He had his first Education, as a King's Scholar in <HI>West∣minster</HI>-School, under the Learned Dr. <HI>Busby</HI>, and in the Year 1650, was elected from thence to <HI>Trinity-College, Cambridge</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>, in the Dedication of his Dramatic Works to the Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>, gives him the fol∣lowing Character.</P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had personal Qualities to challenge both Love and Esteem from all who were truly ac∣quainted with him: He was of a Nature exceedingly humane and compassionate, easily forgiving Injuries, and capable of a prompt and sincere Reconciliation with those who had offended him. Such a Tempe∣rament is the only solid Foundation of all moral Vir∣tues and sociable Endowments. His Friendship, where he professed it, went much beyond his Pro∣fessions; tho' his Hereditary Income was little more ”than a bare Competency.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As his Reading had been very extensive, so was he very happy in a Memory tenacious of every thing that he read. He was not more possessed of Know∣lege than he was communicative of it: But then his Communication of it was by no means Pedantic, or imposed upon the Conversation; but just such, and went so far, as by the natural Turns of the Discourse, in which he was engaged, it was necessarily promot∣ed ”or required.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He was extreme ready and gentle in his Cor∣rection of the Errors of any Writer, who thought fit to consult him; and full as ready and patient to admit of the Reprehension of others, in Respect of his own Oversights or Mistakes. He was of very easy, I may say of very pleasing Access, but somewhat slow, and as it were diffident in his Advances to others. He had something in his Nature that ab∣horred Intrusion into any Society whatsoever. In∣deed it is to be regretted that he was rather blame∣able in the other Extreme; for by that Means, he was personally less known; and consequently his Character might become liable both to Misapprehen∣sion ”and Misrepresentation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="110"/>
<Q>“To the best of my Knowledge and Observation, he was, of all Men that ever I knew, one of the most modest, and the most easily to be discountenan∣ced in his Approaches, either to his Superiors or ”his Equals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Writings, I shall not take up∣on me to speak of them; for to say little of them, would not be to do them right, and to say all that I ought to say, would be to be very voluminous. But I may venture to say in general Terms, that no Man had written in our Language so much and so various Matter, and in so various Manners, so well. Ano∣ther thing I may say was very peculiar to him; which is, that his Parts did not decline with his Years; but that he was an improving Writer to his last, even to near seventy Years of Age, improving even in Fire and Imagination, as well as in Judg∣ment; witness his Ode on St. <HI>Cecilia's Day</HI>, and his ”Fables, his last Performances.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He was equally excellent in Verse and in Prose: His Prose had all the Clearness imaginable, together with all the Nobleness of Expression, all the Graces and Ornaments proper and peculiar to it, without deviating into the Language or Diction of Poetry. I make this Observation only to distinguish his Style from that of many Poetical Writers, who meaning to write harmoniously in Prose, do in truth often ”write meer blank Verse.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“His Versification and his Numbers he could learn of no body: For he first possessed those Talents in Perfection in our Tongue: And they who have best succeeded in them since his Time, have been in∣debted to his Example; and the more they have been able to imitate him, the better have they suc∣”ceeded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As his Style in Prose is always specifically diffe∣rent from his Style in Poetry; so on the other hand in his Poems, his Diction is, wherever his Subject re∣quires it, so Sublime, and so truly Poetical, that its Essence, like that of pure Gold, cannot be destroyed.
<PB N="85" REF="111"/>
Take his Verses and divest them of their Rhimes, disjoint them in their Numbers, transpose their Ex∣pressions, make what Arrangement and Disposition you please of his Words, yet shall there eternally be Poetry, and something which will be found incapa∣ble of being resolved into absolute Prose; an incon∣”testable Characteristic of a truly Poetical Genius.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I will say but one Word more in General of his Writings; which is, that what he has done in any one Species, or distinct Kind, would have been sufficient to have acquired him a great Name. If he had written Nothing but his Prefaces, or nothing but his Songs, or his Prologues, each of them would have intitled him to the Preference and distinction of ”excelling in this Kind.</Q></P>
<P>He died in <HI>London</HI>, in the Year 1700, in the 67th Year of his Age, and was buried with great Funeral Pomp, in <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI>, at the Expence of the Lord <HI>Jefferies</HI>. Above twenty Years after, his Grace <HI>John Sheffield</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> erected a Mo∣nument to his Memory, with his Busto on it, near those of <HI>Cowley, Chaucer</HI>, &amp;c. on which he ordered no other Inscription than</P>

<HEAD><HI>JOHN WILMOT</HI> Earl of <HI>ROCHES∣TER</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>This Witty Nobleman was born at <HI>Ditchly</HI> in <HI>Ox∣fordshire</HI> in 1648, and the Son of <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>, who through almost insuperable Difficulties, carried of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after the Battle of <HI>Worcester</HI>.</P>
<P>He received an Education suitable to his Rank, and through a lively Genius and a natural Propensity to Learning, could repeat almost every line of <HI>Horace, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI>, before he was sent to the University of <HI>Oxford</HI>.</P>
<P>He made the Tour of <HI>Europe</HI>, and returned from his Travels at Eighteen Years of Age. Nor was he long at Court when he entered a Volunteer under the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Spragge</HI>; and in that Memorable Sea-fight with <HI>Van Trompe</HI>, gave signal Proofs of his Courage.</P>
<P>On his Return he gave into all the Pleasures of the Court and Town, of Love and Wine; which at that Time were carried to a prodigious Excess, under the Smiles of a Monarch, formed by Nature for the En∣joyment of the most elegant Desires.</P>
<P>His Talent for Satire was admirable; he spared no body, not even his Majesty, who at length banished
<PB N="88" REF="114"/>
him the Court, for a Satire made directly on him: <HI>Villiers</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> being disgraced about the same Time, these two Noblemen resolved to go in search of Adventures, and in Pursuance of this Resoluti∣on took an Inn on the Road to <HI>Newmarket</HI>, where each in his Turn officiated as Master. But as it would take too much room to relate their Adventures, we shall pass them over, and only add, that his Majesty soon after coming that Way, found them both at their Posts, took them into Favour, and carried them with him to <HI>Newmarket</HI>.</P>
<P>But as Beauty generally owes it's Ruin to its own Charms, so did my Lord's; the uncommon Charms of whose Person and Conversation, drew him into a continued round of Excess, which brought on a Consumption. He retired to the Lodge at <HI>Woodstock</HI> Park, where he died on the 26th of <HI>July</HI>, 1680, and in the 33d Year of his Age.</P>
<P>He was attended during the greatest Part of his Illness by the Reverend Doctor <HI>Burnet</HI>, (afterwards Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>,) by whose Pious Instructions he looked back with Horror on his past Life, and ended it full of Re∣pentance.

<HEAD>Mrs. APHRA BEHN,</HEAD>
<P>Was descended from a good Family in the City of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, and was born some time in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Her Father's Name was <HI>Johnson</HI>, who, being a Relation to the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>, was appointed Lieutenant General of <HI>Surinam</HI>. He em∣barked for his Government, and died in the Voyage; but his Family arrived at <HI>Surinam</HI>, where our Au∣thoress became acquainted with the Story and Person of the <HI>American</HI> Prince <HI>Oroonoko</HI>, whose Adventures she has so feelingly described in the celebrated Novel of that Name.</P>
<P>When she returned to <HI>England</HI>, she was married in <HI>London</HI> to Mr. <HI>Behn</HI>, a Merchant of <HI>Dutch</HI> Extraction: And during the <HI>Dutch</HI> War King <HI>Charles</HI> II. thought her a proper Person to be employed in some impor∣tant Affairs, which occasioned her going to <HI>Antwerp</HI>. By her Intrigues while she was in that City, she dis∣covered the Design, formed by the <HI>Dutch</HI>, of sailing up the <HI>Thames</HI>, and burning the <HI>English</HI> Ships in their Harbours; and this she communicated to the Court of <HI>England</HI>; but her Intelligence, tho' well-grounded, as appeared by the Event, being only laughed at, she laid aside any farther Thoughts of State Affairs, and amused herself during the rest of her Stay at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, with the Gallantries of the Place. In her Return to <HI>England</HI> she embarked at <HI>Dunkirk</HI>, and was very near being lost in the Passage; for the Ship being driven on the Coast, foundered within Sight of Land; but by the Assistance of Boats from the Shore, all that were on board were saved.</P>
<P>After her Arrival at <HI>London</HI>, she dedicated the rest of her Life to Pleasure and Poetry.</P>
<P>She published, besides seventeen <HI>Plays</HI>, three Vo∣lumes of <HI>Miscellany Poems</HI>, two Volumes of <HI>Histories</HI> and <HI>Novels</HI>. She likewise translated Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s <HI>History of Oracles</HI>, and <HI>Plurality of Worlds</HI>, to which

<HEAD>Mr. THOMAS BETTERTON.</HEAD>
<P>This English <HI>Roscius</HI> was born 1638, in <HI>Tuttle-street, Westminster</HI>, his Father being under Cook to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. He was put Apprentice to Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI>, Book∣seller, near <HI>Charing-Cross</HI>, who having been Wardrobe-Keeper to the King's Company of Comedians in the <HI>Black-Fryars</HI>, obtained a Licence to set up a Company of Players at the <HI>Cock-Pit</HI> in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was entered in this Company before he was twenty Years of Age, and soon acquired the Reputation of a promising Genius. While he was rising to perfection under Mr. <HI>Rhodes, Charles</HI> II. grant∣ed a Patent to Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> for erecting a Company under the Name of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Ser∣vants, who took Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, and all who acted un∣der Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> into his Company, in the Year 1662.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> making the foremost Figure among the Men in Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI>'s Company, married
<PB N="108" REF="134"/>
Mrs. <HI>Saunderson</HI>, who was the most excellent among the Women, and one of the first that appeared on the Stage. In 1693, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, with a select Number of the Actors, obtained the Royal Licence to act in a se∣parate Theatre, and many Persons of Quality came into a voluntary Subscription of twenty, and some forty Guineas a-piece for erecting a Theatre within the Walls of the Tennis-Court, in <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Fields</HI>, which was opened with Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Love for Love</HI>, which was acted with great success: But they were again re∣duced to join with the other Company in <HI>Drury Lane</HI>, which remained the only Company till after Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> had built a new Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> weary of the Fatigues and Toil of Go∣vernment, delivered his Company over to this new Li∣cence: But they again giving Way to the new Mode of Operas the Companies were once more united in <HI>Dru∣ry-Lane</HI>, and the Operas confined to the <HI>Hay-Mar∣ket</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> being now very old, and much af∣flicted with the Gout, was resolved to quit the Stage, and take leave of the Town in a public Manner, on his Benefit Night, which was the 7th of <HI>April</HI> 1709. The Play was <HI>Love for Love</HI>, in which he acted the Part of <HI>Valentine</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, who had both left the Stage the Year before, appeared for this Night, to shew their Friendship and Gratitude to their old Acquaintance, and assist the Interest of one, to whom they all owed great Obligations. So splendid an Audience was hardly ever seen at the Theatre as on this Occasion.</P>
<P>In the Year 1710, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> removed to the <HI>Hay Market</HI>, with several others from <HI>Drury Lane</HI>, being prevailed on by Persons of the first Rank to con∣tinue one Year longer tho' but seldom: Another Play was acted for his Benefit, which was the <HI>Maid's Tra∣gedy</HI> of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>; between the Acts was a Chorus after the Manner of the Ancients, represent∣ing in Dumb Shew, all that had been done in the Act before.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="135"/>The Part of <HI>Melantius</HI> in this Play was the last Part this great Master of his Profession ever acted; when being seized suddenly with the Gout, he submitted, by extraordinary Applications, to have his Foot so far re∣lieved, that he might be able to walk on the Stage with a Slipper, rather than wholly disappoint his Auditors. He was observed this Day to have exerted a more than ordinary Spirit, but the unhappy Consequence of tampering with his Distemper was, that it flew into his Head, and killed him in three Days, in the 74th Year of his Age, after he had been above fifty Years the chief Ornament of the Stage.</P>
<P>This excellent Player was a true Copy of the Roman <HI>Roscius</HI>, not only in his Performance, but in all his o∣ther noble Virtues; and like him, gained the Esteem of all who knew him. His Character is thus drawn by an eminent Cotemporary Author.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Roscius</HI>, a sincere Friend and Man of strict Ho∣nour: grown old in the Arms and Approbation of his Audience: not to be corrupted even by the Way of living and Manners of those whom he hourly con∣”versed with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Roscius</HI>, born for every thing that he thinks fit to undertake, has Wit and Morality, Fire and Judgment, sound Sense and good Nature: <HI>Roscius</HI>, who would have still been eminent in any Station of Life, he had been called to, only unhappy to the World, in that it is not possible for him to bid Time stand still, and permit him to endure for ever, the Orna∣ment of the Stage, the Delight of his Friends, and the regret of all, who shall one Day have the Mis∣fortune ”to lose him.</Q></P>
<P>As to his excellence as an Actor, we need no other Record, than what Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> says in the following Words in his <HI>Apology</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>“I never heard Lines in a Tragedy come from him wherein my Judgment, my Ear, and my Imagination, were not fully satisfied; which since his Time, I ”could not equally say of any one Actor whatsoever.</Q></P>

<P>This Gentleman was descended from the ancient Fa∣mily of the <HI>Congreves</HI> of <HI>Congreve</HI> in the County of <HI>Stafford</HI>, and was the only surviving Son of <HI>William Congreve</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was the second Son of <HI>Richard Con∣greve</HI> of <HI>Congreve</HI> and <HI>Stretton</HI> in the said County, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> He was born at a Place called <HI>Bardsea</HI>, not far from <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>, being a Part of the Estate of Sir <HI>John Lewis</HI> his great Uncle by the Mother's Side.</P>
<P>His Father being a younger Brother, his Affairs and his Command in the Army carried him into <HI>Ireland</HI>, when Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> was very young, by which Means he had his Education in the great School or College of <HI>Kilkenny</HI> and the University of <HI>Dublin</HI>, which was the Reason why some People imagined he was born in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>He returned to <HI>England</HI> soon after the <HI>Revolution</HI>, entered into the Society of the <HI>Middle-Temple</HI>, where he began to Study the Law; but did not make so great a Progress as to be called to the Bar. He turned his Thoughts very early to the Muses, and wrote his first Play when he was very Young. His Comedy called <HI>Love for Love</HI>, with which the new House in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</HI> opened in 1693, had so great Success, that Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and the other Ma∣nagers of that Theatre offered him a whole Share with them in their Profits, which he accepted, and obliged himself, if his Health permitted, to give them one new Play every Year.</P>
<P>In 1697, Mr. <HI>Jeremy Collier</HI>, a Nonjuring Cler∣gyman, wrote his Treatise against the Profaneness and Immorality of the Stage, in which he fell more severe∣ly upon Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> and Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> than on any others: But they both answered him, tho' not with the same Reputation to themselves that they had got by their other Writings.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> in his rough Magisterial Manner, seem∣ed more fit to answer the low Language of <HI>Collier</HI>,
<PB N="115" REF="141"/>
and certainly did it more effectually, as <HI>Billingsgate</HI> Fish-wives are fittest to encounter each other.</P>
<P>When the Theatre in the <HI>Hay market</HI> was built in 1706, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and his Co-partners threw them∣selves under the Direction of Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>; but the latter in a few Months, gave up his Share entirely to the other.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> was allowed to be a Person of profound Learning, but of little or no Politeness. However, his Learning gained him the Acquaintance of most of the eminent Wits of the Age. His Temper was of the morose kind, and so much inclined to be severe, that no Piece of Dramatic, or other Poetry, ever escap∣ed his Censure, if it met with Success; which gained him the Name of Sir <HI>Tremendous Longinus</HI>.</P>
<P>But the Works of this Critic drew, in their turn, the <HI>Critics</HI> upon him, tho' few of them wrote against him, but took the Method of exploding every thing he published, which by mortifying his Purse, so much increased his Ill-Nature, that he declared himself an Enemy to the whole Tribe of <HI>Parnassus</HI>.

<P>This accomplished Nobleman was descended from the Ancient and Noble Family of the <HI>Granvilles</HI>, seated for many Ages in <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Cornwall</HI>.</P>
<P>He received the first Rudiments of Education in <HI>Pa∣ris</HI>, under the Tuition of the Learned <HI>Sir William Ellis:</HI> At Ten Years of Age, he was called back to <HI>England</HI>, and at Eleven was sent to <HI>Trinity-College, Cambridge</HI>,
<PB N="119" REF="145"/>
where he made such Progress in Erudition, that in the thirteenth Year of his Age, he was elected Master of Arts, the only one of those Years that was ever known to receive so great a Token of Regard.</P>
<P>After he had compleated his Studies, he launched into the World; in the Year 1710, was made Se∣cretary at War, and in the same Year Comptroller and Treasurer of the Houshold, and one of her Ma∣jesty's Privy Counsellors. In 1711, he was created a <HI>Peer</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>, by the Stile and Title of Ba∣ron of <HI>Lansdown</HI> and <HI>Biddeford</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. JOSEPH HAINES, (commonly cal∣led <HI>Count Haines</HI>.)</HEAD>
<P>WE cannot find out the Time when this merry Co∣median was born, but we are certain he received his Rudiments of Learning at the School of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the Fields, <HI>London</HI>, where he made such Progress that he was the Admiration of all that knew him.</P>
<P>His ready Wit, and facetious Humour prevailed up∣on several Gentlemen to send him to <HI>Queen's-College,
<PB N="120" REF="146"/>
Oxford</HI>, where his Learning, and infinite Fund of Hu∣mour, gained him the Esteem and Regard of Sir <HI>Jo∣seph Williamson</HI>, who when he was made Secretary of State, took <HI>Joe</HI> for his <HI>Latin</HI> Secretary. But <HI>Haines</HI> had too little Taciturnity for an Employment of that Kind; for Sir <HI>Joseph</HI> too often heard the Substance of his Epistles to Foreign Courts, before they could come to the Hands of those Persons who were to re∣ceive them. Upon this Account, <HI>Joe</HI> was remov∣ed from his Employment; however <HI>Sir Joseph</HI> re∣commended him to one of the Heads of the Uni∣versity of <HI>Cambridge</HI>, where he was willingly received; but a Company of Players coming to <HI>Stourbridge</HI> Fair, near that Place, <HI>Joe</HI> fell so much in Love with their Employment and Way of Living, that he threw away his Cap and Band, and made one of their Company.</P>
<P>He was soon called to the King's Company in <HI>Dru∣ry-Lane</HI>, where his inimitable Performance and Viva∣city brought him into the Familiarity, of the Wits of the Age, and Persons of the first Rank, in so much, that a Noble Duke going Ambassador to <HI>France</HI>, thought it no Disgrace to take <HI>Haines</HI> as a Companion. <HI>Joe</HI> (besides the dead Languages) spoke <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> to as much Perfection, as if he had been born both at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI>, and therefore it is no Wonder that he was caressed by many of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility. Here he took the Title of <HI>Count</HI>, and by his Art, tricked many of the rich Citizens of <HI>Paris</HI> out of large Sums of Money.</P>
<P>After his <HI>French</HI> Expedition he returned to the Stage again, and had the Art to form the Countenances of his Audience by his own; for the Muscles of his Face, were, like Gaping, generally catching. His <HI>Prologues</HI> and <HI>Epilogues</HI> do not seem extraordinary in the Reading, but his manner of speaking, made them inimitable.</P>
<P>The Epilogue in particular that he spoke riding on an Ass, created such a Laughter and reiterated Ap∣plauses, that it was near Half an Hour in the speaking.</P>
<P>There is one Play that goes under his Name, called</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="147"/><HI>A Fatal Mistake</HI>, or <HI>The Plot spoiled</HI>. The Title says as it was lately acted, 1696. But by the misera∣ble Composition, <HI>Haines</HI> is acquitted from being the Author.</P>
<P>This excellent Comedian died of a Fever, (after a short Illness) <HI>April</HI> the 4th 1701, at his Lodgings in <HI>Hart-Street</HI>, Long Acre, and was buried in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Church Yard.</P>

<HEAD><HI>COLLY CIBBER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Poet Laureat.</HEAD>
<P>This Poet was the Son of <HI>Gabriel Cibber</HI>, a Native of <HI>Holstein</HI>, and a Statuary in the Reign of <HI>Char∣les</HI> II. and very excellent in his Art; as appears by the Figures of the two Lunatics, on the Piers of the Gate at <HI>Bedlam</HI>, the Basso-relievo on the Pedestal of the Monument at the Bottom of <HI>Fish-Street-Hill</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He had a very early Inclination to the Stage, and, contrary to the Advice of his Father, turned Player, before he was twenty Years of Age.</P>
<P>The first Part in which he appeared with any Glimpse of Success was the Chaplain in the <HI>Orphan</HI>, which he performed so well, that it drew such a Commendation upon him, from an old and celebrated Actor, that, as he tells us himself, it filled his Bosom with as great Transports as ever were felt by <HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Charles</HI> the XIIth of <HI>Sweden</HI>, at the Head of their Victorious Armies.</P>
<P>The next Part was that of Lord <HI>Touchwood</HI>, in <HI>Con∣greve</HI>'s <HI>Double Dealer</HI>, acted before Queen <HI>Mary</HI>, which he got perfect in one Day, upon the Illness of <HI>Kynaston</HI> who was to have acted the Part. To this he was recommended by the Author, and performed it so well, that Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> made him this Compliment of saying, that he had not only answered, but had exceeded his Expectations. And he said more of him to his Masters, the Patentees, upon which his Salary, was raised from fifteen Shillings a Week as it then stood, to twenty. And this same Actor we have seen within these few Years acting at the Pay of fifty Pounds a Night.</P>
<P>The Part of <HI>Fondle-Wife</HI>, in the <HI>Old-Batchelor</HI>, was the next he was taken any Notice of in, which Part he also got up in a Hurry, upon a Case of Necessity; but mimicked <HI>Dogget</HI> so well in it, that he got great Ap∣plause.</P>
<P>A Year after this he wrote his first Play, <HI>Love's last Shift</HI>, in which he performed the Part of Sir <HI>No∣velty Fashion</HI>. The Play had deserved Success, and
<PB N="123" REF="149"/>
the Fop was so well executed, that from that Time Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was never thought to have his Equal in Parts of the same Cast.</P>
<P>In the Year 1711, he became a Patentee and joint Sharer, in the Management of the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, with Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Dogget</HI>; as he was afterwards with Sir <HI>Richard Steele, Wilks</HI> and <HI>Booth</HI>. In the Year 1730, he was appointed Poet Laureat to his Majesty.</P>
<P>In the Year 1741, he sold his Share in the Patent, and quitted the Stage for a Constancy, but has appear∣ed a few Times since for a very valuable Considerati∣on, and to act a Part in a new Play of his own, cal∣led <HI>Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King</HI> John; which he performed with great Spirit, altho' more than seven∣ty Years of Age.

<HEAD>Mr. GEORGE FARQUHAR.</HEAD>
<P>Was born in the North of <HI>Ireland</HI>, of Parents that held no mean Rank in that part of the Country, who having a numerous Issue could bestow on him no other Fortune than a genteel Education; which he com∣pleated in the University of <HI>Dublin</HI>, where he acquired a considerable Reputation.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was in the University he sent to a Gentleman to borrow <HI>Burnet's History of the Refor∣mation</HI>; but the Gentleman sent him Word, <HI>he never
<PB N="130" REF="156"/>
lent any Book out of his Chamber, but if he would come there he should make use of it as long as he pleased</HI>. A little while after the Owner of the Book sent to borrow Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Bellows, he returned the Compliment,
<Q>“I never lend my Bellows out of my Chamber, but if he be pleased to come there, he should make use of ”them as long as he would.</Q></P>
<P>He began very early to apply himself to the Stage as an Actor, following the Examples of <HI>Lee</HI> and <HI>Ot∣way</HI>, with our great <HI>Shakespear</HI>, and with like Success, who though all excellent <HI>Dramatic Poets</HI> made but indifferent Actors; however Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> having the Advantage of a very good Person, tho' with a weak Voice, was never repulsed by the Audience. But the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation. Playing the Part of <HI>Guiomar</HI> in the <HI>In∣dian Emperor</HI>, who is supposed to kill <HI>Vasquez</HI> one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Generals, not remembering to change his Sword for a Foil, in the Mock Engagement he wounded the Person that represented <HI>Vasquez</HI>, tho' as it fell out not dangerously; nevertheless it put an End to his appear∣ing on the Stage as an Actor.</P>
<P>He wrote his first Comedy of <HI>Love and a Bottle</HI> at nineteen, and was peculiarly happy in the Choice of his Subjects, which he took care to adorn with varie∣ty of Characters and Incidents.</P>
<P>He attempted to play the Part of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> for his own Benefit in <HI>Dublin</HI>, which answered his De∣sign in gaining a crowded Audience; but he executed the Part so lamely that his Friends were ashamed for him. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e see a <HI>good</HI> Poet may make but an <HI>in∣different</HI> Actor.</P>
<P>His Plays were wrote in the Order as follows.

</LIST></P>
<P>His last Comedy, was wrote in six Weeks, during a settled Illness all the while; he perceived the Ap∣proaches of Death before he had finished the last Act, and as he often foretold, died before the Run of the Play was over.</P>
<P>His Friend Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, often visited him in his Ill∣ness: In one of these Visits, he told Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs. <HI>Sullen</HI> in giving her to <HI>Archer</HI>, with∣out a proper Divorce, which was not a security for her Honour; <HI>to salve that</HI>, replied the Author, <HI>I'll get a real Divorce, Marry her myself, and give her my Bond she shall be a real Widow in less than a Fortnight</HI>.</P>
<P>When he expired, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> took care to bury him decently in St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the Fields, and found among his Papers this short Note.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. SUSANNA CENTLIVRE,</HEAD>
<P>Was born in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI>, and sprung from a Repu∣table Family in that Country. Her Father's Name was <HI>Freeman</HI>, and her Education was intirely owing to her own Industry, and the Assistance of a Neighbour∣ing <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, who so much admired her sprightly Wit and Manner, that he undertook to in∣struct her in the <HI>French</HI> Language, wherein she made such a rapid Progress, that she could, before she was twelve Years of Age, read <HI>Moliere</HI>, with all the Viva∣city, and distinguished Characters of the Drama.</P>
<P>This gave her some Consolation for the Ill-usage of her Step-mother, which was so much beyond all bearing, that on the Death of her Father, she determin∣ed to leave her. At the Time she had formed this Resolution, a Company of stroling Players came to

<HEAD>The Rt. Hon. <HI>JOSEPH ADDISON; <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>This uncommon Favourite of the Muses was Son of Dr. <HI>Lancelot Addison</HI>, Dean of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI>, by his Wife <HI>Jane</HI>, whose Maiden Name was <HI>Gulstone</HI>. He was born at <HI>Milston</HI>, near <HI>Amesbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire</HI>, on the first of <HI>May</HI>, 1672, and was very early put under the Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Naish</HI> at the School of <HI>Amesbury</HI>, but was soon after removed to <HI>Salisbury</HI> School, and from thence to the <HI>Charter House</HI> in <HI>London</HI>, where the first Intimacy began between him and Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>, which continued as long as he lived. From the <HI>Charter House</HI> he went to <HI>Queen's College, Oxford</HI>, and in about two Years after was elected into <HI>Magdalene College</HI>, and there took his Degrees of Batchelor and Master of Arts. One of the first Specimens he gave of his extraordinary Genius in <HI>Poetry</HI>, was a short Copy of <HI>English</HI> Verses, dated from <HI>Magdalene-College</HI>, 1693, when the Author was not above 22 Years of Age, to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> upon his translation of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Juvenal, Persius</HI>, and
<PB N="148" REF="174"/>
<HI>Ovid</HI>. He soon after gave a Version of the fourth <HI>Georgic</HI>, prefixed to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s translation of <HI>Virgil</HI>.</P>
<P>His Design of going into Orders, was over ruled by his Friend the Earl of <HI>Halifax</HI>, that great Patron of the Muses, and all the polite Arts, who, as Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> informs us, made warm Instances to the Head of <HI>Magdalene-Col<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege</HI>, not to insist upon his going into Orders, but to suffer him to come into Business, where Men of liberal Educations were so much wanted. That noble Lord concludes his Letter,
<Q>“That however he might be represented as no Friend to the Church, he would never do it any other Injury than keeping ”Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> out of it.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> Poems of Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>, published in the <HI>Musoe Anglicanae</HI>, were not only admired at Home, but Monsieur <HI>Boileau</HI>, the celebrated <HI>French</HI> Poet, upon perusing them, is said to have conceived a greater Idea of the Genius of the <HI>English</HI> Nation for Poetry, than he ever had before, and shewed the Author very great Civilities when he was in <HI>France</HI>. By the Interest of the Lord <HI>Somers</HI>, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> procured a Pension of three hundred Pounds a Year from the Crown to support his Expences in travelling to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>. In 1701, he wrote <HI>A Letter to the Lord</HI> Halifax <HI>from</HI> Italy, in Verse, which is looked upon as one of his finest Pieces in that sort of Poetry. The Author had also so much esteem in the last mentioned Nation, that this Letter was translated into <HI>Italian</HI>, by Sig. <HI>Salvini</HI>, Professor of the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue at <HI>Florence</HI>.</P>
<P>When our Author was about to return to <HI>England</HI>, in 1702, he received Letters from his Friends, to let him know that he was designed to attend the Army under Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>, as Secretary from King <HI>William</HI>; but a Stop was put to this, by the Death of his Majesty; an Account of which he received at <HI>Ge∣neva</HI>. And his Friends having lost their Interest in the beginning of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, which prevent∣ed his farther Advancement, he had Leisure to make the Tour of <HI>Germany</HI> in his Way home. It was at <HI>Vienna</HI> he began to methodize his Book of Medals, which is a curious Piece.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="175"/>At the Time of the Victory at <HI>Blenheim</HI>, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was entirely without Employment in the State, therefore took up a Lodging according to his <HI>Finances</HI>, which were not very great. We ought not to lessen the Merit of any Author, but that glorious Poem of the Campaign, was not the first Thought of Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>, since that great Man, <HI>Henry Boyle</HI>, Lord <HI>Earleton</HI>, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was employed by the Lord Treasurer <HI>Godolphin</HI>, at the Sollicitation of the Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>, to go to our Author, and desire him to write some Piece which might transmit the Me∣mory of that glorious Victory to Posterity. Mr. <HI>Ad∣dison</HI>, whose Lodgings (as was hinted before) were but very indifferent, was surprized with this Visit from a Person of my Lord's Rank and Station, seemed in some Confusion; but he was very agreeably brought out of it, when the Chancellor acquainted him with his Com∣mission, and that the Lord Treasurer, to encourage him in the Work, had already made him one of the Com∣missioners of the <HI>Appeals</HI>, and desired him to look upon that Post, but as an earnest of something more consider∣able. And my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI>, when that excel∣lent Poem called the <HI>Campaign</HI> was finished, kept his Word by giving our Author another Post, in 1705.</P>
<P>The same Year he attended my Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> to <HI>Ha∣nover</HI>; and in 1706, was made Secretary to Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI>, Secretary of State, and continued so to the Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>, who succeeded him When the Lord <HI>Whar∣ton</HI> was appointed Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI>, in 1709, he made Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> Secretary for that Kingdom; and her Majesty, as a Mark of her Favour to him, bestow∣ed on him the Post of Keeper of the Records in <HI>Ireland</HI>. It was while he was in that Kingdom, that he first dis∣covered Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> (afterwards Sir <HI>Richard</HI>) to be the Author of the <HI>Tatler</HI>, by an Observation on <HI>Virgil</HI> which he had communicated to him. He lent so much Assistance afterwards to that Paper, that Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>, in the Close of it, allows him the Honour of being Author of the most applauded Pieces in it. He
<PB N="150" REF="176"/>
had a great Share also in <HI>The Spectators</HI> and <HI>Guardians:</HI> Those excellent Pieces are so well known and admired, that they need not any Commendation here.</P>
<P>When the Ministry was changed in the latter Part of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, and he expected no further Employment, he had formed a Design of composing an <HI>English</HI> Dictionary, which he thought much want∣ing in our Language; but being soon after brought in∣to Business again, that noble Design was dropt, which the World has Reason to regret.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of the Queen he was appointed Se∣cretary to the Lords Justices; and the Earl of <HI>Sunder∣land</HI> becoming a second Time Secretary of State, in 1714, he was again made Secretary for <HI>Ireland</HI>; and when the Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> resigned the Post of Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI>, he was made one of the Lords Commissioners of Trade.</P>
<P>In the Year 1713, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> published his cele∣brated Paper, called <HI>The Freeholder</HI>, wrote in Defence of Liberty and the present happy Establishment. In 1716, he married the Countess of <HI>Warwick</HI>.</P>
<P>In 1717, he was raised to the high Post of one of his Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State; but the close Application which that Employment required, so much impaired his Health, that he was obliged to resign it in a short Time; and tho' he seemed somewhat better in his first Recess from Business; yet a Relapse into his former Disorder of an Asthma, attended with a Dropsy, took from the World all that could die of this great Man, on the 17th of <HI>June</HI> 1719.

The first Part he acted on the <HI>English</HI> Stage, was that of <HI>Maximus</HI> in the Tragedy of <HI>Valentinian</HI>, in which he met with great Applause; but what carried his Reputation to the full Extent, was his performing the Part of <HI>Cato</HI>, to which he did such Justice, that it recommended him to the Favour of the whole Town; and in a particular Man∣ner to the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>, then one of the principal Secretaries of State, who, a very little Time after pro∣cured a special Licence from Queen <HI>Anne</HI>, to add him to the Number of the Managers of the Theatre.</P>
<P>He married for his first Wife Mrs. <HI>Frances Bark∣ham</HI>, Daughter of Sir <HI>William Barkham</HI> of <HI>Norfolk</HI>, Bart. who died in 1710, without issue.</P>
<P>In the Year 1719, he married Mrs. <HI>Hester Santlow</HI>, one of the finest Women that ever appeared upon the Stage; and as amiable for her sweet Disposition and prudent Behaviour in her Domestic Affairs; with this Delightful Companion he continued in the utmost hap∣piness till the Year 1727, when he was seized with a violent Fever, that lasted forty-six Days without In∣termission, and in all that Time it was remarkable, that he was delirious but two Nights and one Day; which is taken Notice of to obviate a Report, that ran thro' the Town, <HI>That he was out of his Senses during the whole Time of his Illness</HI>.</P>
<P>From hence to the Time of his Death, his Health was never perfectly re-established, and he acted only eight Nights during that Interval, which was of six Years; and those were in the Run of a Play, brought upon the Stage by Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI>, said to be one of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, called <HI>Double Falsehood</HI>, or <HI>The Distressed Lovers</HI>.
