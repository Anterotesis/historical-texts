<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON, <DATE>Feb. 21, 1768.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK myself greatly obli∣ged
to you, and desire you
to accept my most grateful
thanks, for the valuable pre∣sent
you have done me the ho∣nour
to make me, of your Ac∣count
of Corsica, which has
given me the pleasure of being
more perfectly acquainted with
the greatest character of this
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
age. I had gained some know∣ledge
of it, before I saw your
book, from the letters of ano∣ther
English gentleman on that
subject; but you have added
many curious and interesting
particulars, which I have read
with much delight and admira∣tion.
If I were a few years
younger. I would go in pilgri∣mage
to Corsica (as you have
done) to visit this living image
of ancient virtue, and to vene∣rate
in the mind of PASCAL
PAOLI the spirit of TIMOLE∣ON
and EPAMINONDAS. But I
must now be content with see∣ing
him in your description,
the vivacity of which shews,
that your heart is inflamed
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
with the same generous passion
which glows so brightly in his.
I wish with you that our go∣vernment
had shewn more re∣spect
for Corsican liberty, and
think it disgraces our nation
that we do not live in good
friendship with a brave people
engaged in the noblest of all
contests, a contest against ty∣ranny,
and who have never
given us any cause of com∣plaint.
Besides sympathy of
sentiment, which is a natural
bond of union, we ought in po∣licy
to shew as much regard
for them, as the Genoese, their
oppressors, have shewn for the
French, in our late wars with
that nation.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>

and esteem,</P>

And obliged humble servant,

<HEAD>DEDICATION
TO
PASCAL PAOLI
GENERAL OF
THE CORSICANS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DEDICATIONS are for most
part the offerings of in∣terested
servility, or the effu∣sions
of partial zeal; enume∣rating
the virtues of men in
whom no virtues can be
found, or predicting great∣ness
to those who afterwards
pass their days in unambi∣tious
indolence, and die leav∣ing
no memorial of their ex∣istence,
but a dedication, in

<PB REF="10"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
which all their merit is con∣fessedly
future, and which
time has turned into a silent
reproach.</P>
<P>He who has any experi∣ence
of mankind, will be cau∣tious
to whom he dedicates.
Publickly to bestow praise on
merit of which the publick is
not sensible, or to raise flat∣tering
expectations which are
never fulfilled, must sink the
character of an authour, and
make him appear a cringing
parasite, or a fond enthusiast.</P>
<P>I am under no apprehen∣sions
of that nature, when I
inscribe this book to Pascal
Paoli. Your virtues, Sir,
are universally acknowledg∣ed;
they dignify the pages
<PB N="xi" REF="12"/>
which I venture to present to
you; and it is my singular
felicity, that my book is the
voucher of its dedication.</P>
<P>In thus addressing you, my
intention is not to attempt
your panegyrick. That may
in some measure be collected
from my imperfect labours.
But I wish to express to the
world, the admiration and
gratitude with which you
have inspired me.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is all the return
that I can make for the ma∣ny
favours which you have
deigned to confer upon me.
I intreat you to receive it as
a testimony of my disposition.
I regret that I have neither
power nor interest to enable
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
me to render any essential
service to you and to the
brave Corsicans. I can only
assure you of the most fer∣vent
wishes of a private gen∣tleman.
I have the honour
to be, with all respect and
affection,</P>

Obliged humble servant,

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO apology shall be made for present∣ing
the world with an Account of
Corsica. It has been for some time ex∣pected
from me; and I own that the ar∣dour
of publick curiosity has both encou∣raged
and intimidated me. On my re∣turn
from visiting Corsica, I found people
wherever I went, desirous to hear what I
could tell them concerning that island
and its inhabitants. Unwilling to repeat
my tale to every company, I thought it
best to promise a book which should speak
for me.</P>
<P>But I would not take upon me to do
this, till I consulted with the General of
the nation. I therefore informed him of
my design. His answer is perhaps too
flattering for me to publish: but I must
beg leave to give it as the licence and
sanction of this work.</P>
<P>Paoli was pleased to write to me thus:
“Non può esser piu generoso il di lei di∣segno
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
di pubblicar colle stampe le osserva∣zioni
che ha fatte sopra la Corsica. Ella
ne ha veduto la fisica situazione, ha potu∣to
esaminare i costumi degli abitanti, e
veder dentro le massime del loro governo,
di cui conosce la costituzione. Questi po∣poli
con entusiasmo di gratitudine uniran∣no
il loro applauso a quello dell' Europa
disingannata. Nothing can be more ge∣nerous
than your design to publish the
observations which you have made upon
Corsica. You have seen its natural situa∣tion,
you have been able to study the
manners of its inhabitants, and to see in∣timately
the maxims of their govern∣ment,
of which you know the constitu∣tion.
This people with an enthusiasm of
gratitude, will unite their applause with
that of undeceived Europe.”</P>
<P>My first intention was to give only a
view of the present state of Corsica, toge∣ther
with Memoirs of its illustrious Ge∣neral.
But by the advice of some learned
friends, whose judgement I respect, I en∣larged
my plan, and fixed on that of the
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
execution of which the publick is now to
judge.</P>
<P>I had before me two French books
expressly written on Corsica. The one
“Histoire de l'Isle de Corse, par M. G. D. C.”
printed at Nancy in 1749. The other
“Memoires Historiques &amp;c. par M. Jaus∣sin
Ancien Apoticaire Major;” printed at
Lausanne in 1758. From both of those
books I derived many useful materials.
The last of them contains a full and sci∣entifick
detail of the natural history of
the island, as also many letters, manifes∣toes
and other papers: and both of them
contain a variety of particulars with re∣gard
to the operations of the French in
Corsica. I had also before me a pretty
large collection of remarks, which I had
committed to writing, while I was in the
island.</P>
<P>But I still found my materials defici∣ent
in many respects. I therefore applied
to my friends abroad; and in the mean
time directed my studies to such books
as might furnish me with any thing re∣lative
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>
to the subject. I am thus enabled
to lay before the world such An Account
of Corsica, as I flatter myself will give some
satisfaction; for, in comparison of the ve∣ry
little that has been hitherto known
concerning that island, this book may be
said to contain a great deal.</P>
<P>It is indeed amazing that an island so
considerable, and in which such noble
things have been doing, should be so im∣perfectly
known. Even the succession of
Chiefs has been unperceived; and because
we have read of Paoli being at the head of
the Corsicans many years back, and Paoli
still appears at their head, the command
has been supposed all this time in the per∣son
of the same man. Hence all our news∣papers
have confounded the gallant Pas∣cal
Paoli in the vigour of manhood, with
the venerable chief his deceased Father
Giacinto Paoli. Nay the same errour has
found its way into the page of the histo∣rian;
for Dr. Smollet when mentioning
Paoli at the siege of Furiani a few years
ago, says he was then past fourscore.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>
I would in the first place return my
most humble thanks to Pascal Paoli, for
the various communications with which
he has been pleased to favour me; and as
I have related his remarkable sayings, I
declare upon honour, that I have neither
added nor diminished; nay so scrupulous
have I been, that I would not make the
smallest variation even when my friends
thought it would be an improvement.
I know with how much pleasure we read
what is perfectly authentick.</P>
<P>Count Rivarola was so good as to re∣turn
me full and distinct answers to a
variety of queries which I sent him with re∣gard
to many particulars concerning Cor∣sica.
I am much indebted to him for
this, and particularly so, from the obli∣ging
manner in which he did it.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. Burnaby, chaplain
to the British factory at Leghorn, made a
tour to Corsica in 1766, at the same time
with the honourable and reverend Mr.
Hervey now bishop of Cloyne. Mr. Bur∣naby
was absent from Leghorn when I
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>
was there, so I had not the pleasure of be∣ing
personally known to him. But he with
great politeness of his own accord, fent me
a copy of the Journal which he made of
what he observed in Corsica. I had the
satisfaction to find that we agreed in every
thing which both of us had considered.
But I found in his Journal, observations
on several things which I had omitted;
and several things which I had remarked,
I found set in a clearer light. As Mr. Bur∣naby
was so obliging as to allow me to
make what use I pleased of his Journal, I
have freely interwoven it into my work.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my obligations to my
esteemed friend Sir John Dick, Bart. his
Britannick Majesty's Consul at Leghorn, to
Signor Gian Quilico Casa Bianca, to the
learned Greek physician Signor Stefano∣poli,
to Colonel Buttafoco, and to the Ab∣bé
Rostini. These gentlemen have all con∣tributed
their aid in erecting my little mo∣nument
to liberty.</P>
<P>I am also to thank an ingenious gentle∣man
who has favoured me with the trans∣lations
<PB N="xix" REF="20"/>
of Seneca's Epigrams. I made ap∣plication
for this favour, in the London
Chronicle; and to the honour of litera∣ture,
I found her votaries very liberal. Se∣veral
translations were sent, of which I
took the liberty to prefer those which had
the signature of Patricius, and which were
improved by another ingenious correspon∣dent
under the signature of Plebeius. By
a subsequent application I begged that Pa∣tricius
would let me know to whom I was
obliged for what I considered as a great
ornament to my book. He has complied
with my request; and I beg leave in this
publick manner, to acknowledge that I
am indebted for those translations to Tho∣mas
Day Esquire, of Berkshire, a gentle∣man
whose situation in life is genteel, and
his fortune affluent. I must add that al∣though
his verses have not only the fire
of youth, but the maturity and correctness
of age, Mr. Day is no more than nine∣teen.</P>
<P>Nor can I omit to express my sense of
the candour and politeness with which
<PB N="xx" REF="21"/>
Sir James Steuart received the remark
which I have ventured to make in op∣position
to a passage concerning the Corsi∣cans,
in his Inquiry into the Principles of
Political Oeconomy.</P>
<P>I have submitted my book to the re∣visal
of several gentlemen who honour
me with their regard, and I am sensible
how much it is improved by their cor∣rections.
It is therefore my duty to re∣turn
thanks to the reverend Mr. Wyvill
rectour of Black Notely in Essex, and to
my old and most intimate friend the re∣verend
Mr. Temple rectour of Mamhead
in Devonshire. I am also obliged to My
Lord Monboddo for many judicious re∣marks,
which his thorough acquaintance
with ancient learning enabled him to
make. But I am principally indebted to
the indulgence and friendly attention of
My Lord Hailes, who under the name of
Sir David Dalrymple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the custom in Scotland to give the Judges of the Court of Session the title of Lords by the names of their estates. Thus Mr. Burnett is Lord Monboddo, and Sir David Dalrymple is Lord Hailes.</NOTE>, has been long
<PB N="xxi" REF="22"/>
known to the world as an able Antiqua∣rian,
and an elegant and humourous Es∣sayist;
to whom the world has no fault
but that he does not give them more of
his own writings, when they value them
so highly.</P>
<P>I would however have it understood,
that although I received the corrections
of my friends with deference, I have not
always agreed with them. An authour
should be glad to hear every candid re∣mark.
But I look upon a man as unwor∣thy
to write, who has not force of mind
to determine for himself. I mention this,
that the judgement of the friends I have
named may not be considered as con∣nected
with every passage in this book.</P>
<P>Writing a book I have found to be like
building a house. A man forms a plan,
and collects materials. He thinks he has
enough to raise a large and stately edifice;
but after he has arranged, compacted and
polished, his work turns out to be a very
small performance. The authour howe∣ver
like the builder, knows how much
<PB N="xxii" REF="23"/>
labour his work has cost him; and there∣fore
estimates it at a much higher rate
than other people think it deserves.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to avoid an osten∣tatious
display of learning. By the idle
and the frivolous indeed, any appearance
of learning is called pedantry. But as I
do not write for such readers, I pay no
regard to their censures. Those by whom
I wish to be judged, will I hope, approve
of my adding dignity to Corsica, by shew∣ing
its consideration among the ancients,
and will not be displeased to find my page
sometimes embellished with a seasonable
quotation from the Classicks. The trans∣lations
are ascribed to their proper au∣thours.
What are not so ascribed are my
own.</P>
<P>It may be necessary to say something
in defence of my orthography. Of late
it has become the fashion to render our
language more neat and trim by leaving
out k after c, and u in the last syllable of
words which used to end in our. The il∣lustrious
Mr. Samuel Johnson, who has a∣lone
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24"/>
executed in England what was the
task of whole academies in other countries,
has been careful in his Dictionary to pre∣serve
the k as a mark of Saxon original.
He has for most part too, been careful to
preserve the u, but he has also omitted it
in several words. I have retained the k,
and have taken upon me to follow a ge∣neral
rule with regard to words ending
in our. Wherever a word originally Latin
has been transmitted to us through the
medium of the French, I have written it
with the characteristical u. An attention
to this may appear trivial. But I own I
am one of those who are curious in the
formation of language in its various
modes; and therefore wish that the affi∣nity
of English with other tongues may
not be forgotten. If this work should at
any future period be reprinted, I hope
that care will be taken of my orthogra∣phy.</P>
<P>He who publishes a book, affecting
not to be an authour, and professing an
indifference for literary fame, may pos∣sibly
<PB N="xxiv" REF="25"/>
impose upon many people such an
idea of his consequence as he wishes
may be received. For my part, I should
be proud to be known as an authour;
and I have an ardent ambition for litera∣ry
fame; for of all possessions I should ima∣gine
literary fame to be the most valuable.
A man who has been able to furnish a
book which has been approved by the
world, has established himself as a re∣spectable
character in distant society, with∣out
any danger of having that character
lessened by the observation of his weak∣nesses.
To preserve an uniform dignity
among those who see us every day, is
hardly possible; and to aim at it, must
put us under the fetters of a perpetual
restraint. The authour of an approved
book may allow his natural disposition
an easy play, and yet indulge the pride
of superiour genius when he considers
that by those who know him only
as an authour, he never ceases to be re∣spected.
Such an authour when in his
hours of gloom and discontent, may have
<PB N="xxv" REF="26"/>
the consolation to think that his writings
are at that very time giving pleasure to
numbers; and such an authour may che∣rish
the hope of being remembered after
death, which has been a great object to
the noblest minds in all ages.</P>
<P>Whether I may merit any portion of
literary fame, the publick will judge.
Whatever my ambition may be, I trust
that my confidence is not too great, nor
my hopes too sanguine.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE
To the Third Edition.</HEAD>
<P>I Now beg leave to present the world with
a more correct edition of my Account
of Corsica. I return my sincere thanks to
those who have taken the trouble to point
out several faults, with a spirit of candid
criticism. I hope they will not be offend∣ed
that in one or two places I have pre∣served
my own reading, contrary to their
opinion; as I never would own that I am
wrong, till I am convinced that it is so.
My orthography I have sufficiently ex∣plained;
and although some pleasantry has
been shewn, I have not met with one ar∣gument
against it.</P>
<P>In justice to Mr. Burnaby, I must ob∣serve,
that the erroneous translation of a
passage in Livy, which is corrected in this
edition, page 64, was mine; it being no
<PB N="xxviii" REF="28"/>
part of his Journal, in which the original
text only was quoted. In comparing the
former editions with this, it will appear
that my first translation renders the mean∣ing
of Livy, but does not convey the turn
of expression, as I hope I have now done.</P>
<P>While I have a proper sense of my obli∣gations
to those who have treated me with
candour, I do not forget that there have
been others who have chosen to treat me
in an illiberal manner. The resentment
of some has evidently arisen from the
grateful admiration which I have expressed
of Mr. Samuel Johnson. Over such, it is
a triumph to me, to assure them, that I ne∣ver
cease to think of Mr. Johnson, with the
same warmth of affection, and the same
dignity of veneration. The resentment of
others it is more difficult to explain. For
what should make men attack one who
never offended them, who has done his
best to entertain them, and who is enga∣ged
in the most generous cause? But I am
told by those who have gone before me in
<PB N="xxix" REF="29"/>
literature, that the attacks of such should
rather flatter me, than give me displea∣sure.</P>
<P>To those who have imagined themselves
very witty in sneering at me for being a
Christian, I would recommend the serious
study of Theology, and I hope they will
attain to the same comfort that I have, in
the belief of a Revelation by which a SA∣VIOUR
is proclamed to the world, and
“life and immortality are clearly brought
to light.”</P>
<P>I am now to return thanks to My Lord
Lyttelton, for being so good as to allow me
to enrich my book with one of his Lord∣ship's
letters to me. I was indeed most
anxious that it should be published; as it
contains an eulogium on Pascal Paoli,
equal to any thing that I have found in
the writings of antiquity. Nor can I deny
that I was very desirous to shew the world
that this worthy and respectable Noble∣man,
to whom genius, learning and vir∣tue
<PB N="xxx" REF="30"/>
owe so much, can amidst all his
literary honours be pleased with what I
have been able to write.</P>
<P>May I be permitted to say that the suc∣cess
of this book has exceeded my warm∣est
hopes. When I first ventured to send
it into the world, I fairly owned an ardent
desire for literary fame. I have obtained
my desire: and whatever clouds may over∣cast
my days, I can now walk here among
the rocks and woods of my ancestors, with
an agreeable consciousness that I have done
something worthy.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
OF CORSICA.
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY is so natural, and so dear to
mankind, whether as individuals, or as
members of society, that it is indispensibly ne∣cessary
to our happiness. Every thing great and
worthy ariseth from it. Liberty gives health to
the mind, and enables us to enjoy the full exer∣cise
of our faculties. He who is in chains cannot
move either easily or gracefully; nothing elegant
or noble can be expected from those, whose spi∣rits
are subdued by tyranny, and whose powers
are cramped by restraint.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, who from the darkest pre∣judice,
or most corrupt venality, would endeavour
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
to reason mankind out of their original and ge∣nuine
feelings, and persuade them to substitute ar∣tificial
sentiment in place of that which is implant¦ed
by GOD and Nature. They would maintain,
that slavery will from habit become easy, and, that
mankind are truly better, when under confine∣ment
and subjection to the arbitrary will of a few.</P>
<P>Such doctrine at this, could never have gained
any ground, had it been addressed to calm rea∣son
alone. Its partisans therefore have found it
necessary to address themselves to the imagina∣tion
and passions; to call in the aid of enthusi∣asm
and superstition; in some countries to instill
a strange love and attachment to their sovereigns;
and in others to propogate certain mystical noti∣ons,
which the mind of man is wonderfully rea∣dy
to receive, of a divine right to rule; as if their
sovereigns had descended from heaven. This last
idea has been cherished for ages, from the “Cara
Deûm soboles, The beloved offspring of the
Gods,” among the Romans, to those various ele∣vated
and endearing epithets, which modern na∣tions
have thought proper to bestow upon their
sovereigns.</P>
<P>But whatever sophisms may be devised in fa∣vour
of slavery, patience under it, can never be
any thing but “the effect of a sickly constitution,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
which creates a laziness and despondency, that
puts men beyond hopes and fears: mortifying
ambition, and other active qualities, which
freedom begets; and instead of them, affording
only a dull kind of pleasure, of being careless
and insensible<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">My lord Molesworth's Account of Denmark, p. 69.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but by entering into socie∣ty,
mankind voluntarily give up a part of their
natural rights, and bind themselves to the obe∣dience
of laws, calculated for the general good.
But, we must distinguish between authority, and
oppression; between laws, and capricious dic∣tates;
and keeping the original intention of go∣vernment
ever in view, we should take care that
no more restraint be laid upon natural liberty,
than what the necessities of society require.</P>
<P>Perhaps the limits between the power of go∣vernment,
and the liberty of the people, should
not be too strictly marked out. Men of taste rec∣kon
that picture hard, where the outlines are so
strong, as to be clearly seen. They admire a piece
of painting, where the colours are delicately blend∣ed,
and the tints, which point out every particu∣lar
object, are softened into each other, by an in∣sensible
gradation. So in a virtuous state, there
should be such a mutual confidence between the
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
government and the people, that the rights of
each should not be expressly defined.</P>
<P>But flagrant injustice, on one side or other,
is not to be concealed; and, without question, it
is the privilege of the side that is injured, to vin∣dicate
itself.</P>
<P>I have been led into these reflections from a
consideration of the arguments by which ingeni∣ous
men in the refinement of politicks have en∣deavoured
to amuse mankind, and turn away
their attention from the plain and simple notions
of liberty.</P>
<P>Liberty is indeed the parent of felicity, of eve∣ry
noble virtue, and even of every art and science.
Whatever vain attempts have been made to raise
the generous plants under an oppressive climate,
have only shewn more evidently the value of
freedom.</P>
<P>It is therefore no wonder that the world has
at all times been roused at the mention of liber∣ty;
and that we read with admiration and a vir∣tuous
enthusiasm, the gallant achievements of
those who have distinguished themselves in the
glorious cause, and the history of states who were
animated with the principle of freedom, and made
it the basis of their constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="37"/>
Should any one transmit to posterity the an∣nals
of an enslaved nation, we should sleep over
whole ages of the humbling detail. Every thing
would be so poor, so tame, and so abject, that
one might as well peruse the records of a prison-house.</P>
<P>But we have a manly satisfaction in reading
the history of the ancient Romans; even abstract∣ing
from their connections and their broils with
other states. Their internal progress alone af∣fords
ample matter of speculation to a judicious
and spirited observer of human nature. We love
to trace the various springs of their conduct, and
of their advancement in civilization. We con∣template
with pleasure the ferments between the
patricians and plebeians, the strong exertions of
rude genius, the vigorous exercises and hardy
virtues of men uncontrouled by timid subjection.</P>
<P>They who entertain an extravagant veneration
for antiquity, would make us believe, that the
divine fire of liberty has been long ago exhausted,
and that any appearances of it which are to be
found in modern times, are but feeble and dim.
They would make us believe that the world is
grown old, that the strength of human nature is
decayed, and that we are no more to expect those
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
noble powers which dignified men in former
ages.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that human nature is the same
at all times, and appears in different lights merely
from a difference of circumstances. In the lan∣guage
of the schoolmen, the substance is fixed,
the accidents only vary. Rome has yet the seven
hills on which the conquerors of the world dwelt,
and these are inhabited by Romans. Athens
still occupies the space from whence philosophy
and genius diffused a radiance to all the nations
around, and is possessed by Athenians. But
neither of these people now retain any resem∣blance
of their illustrious ancestors; this is entire∣ly
owing to the course of political events, which
has produced a total change in their manners.</P>
<P>That the spirit of liberty has flourished in mo∣dern
times, we may appeal to the histories of the
Swiss, and of the Dutch; and the boldest proofs
of it are to be found in the annals of our own
country.</P>
<P>But a most distinguished example of it actually
exists in the island of Corsica. There, a brave and
resolute nation, has now for upwards of six and
thirty years, maintained a constant struggle against
the oppression of the republick of Genoa. These
valiant islanders were for a long time looked upon
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
as an inconsiderable band of malecontents, as a
disorderly troop of rebels, who would speedily be
compelled to resume those chains which they had
frowardly shaken off. They have however con∣tinued
steady to their purpose. Providence has
favoured them; and Europe now turns her eyes
upon them, and with astonishment secs them on
the eve of emancipating themselves for ever from
a foreign yoke, and becoming a free and inde∣pendent
people.</P>

<Q><L>When a long age of vent'rous toil was past,</L>
<L>Celestial freedom blest their isle at last.</L></Q>
<P>The smallness of the Corsican state does not
render it less an object of admiration. On the
contrary, we ought to admire it the more. The
ingenious Mr. Hume<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Essay on the populousness of ancient nations.</NOTE> hath shewn us, that
Rhodes, Thebes, and many of the famous an∣cient
states were not so numerous as the people of
Corsica now are. If the ten thousand Greeks have
gained immortal honour, because they were op∣posed
to the armies of the Persian monarch, Shall
not the Corsicans be found deserving of glory,
who have set themselves against a republick, which
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
has been aided at different times by the power of
France, and by that of the empire of Germany?</P>
<P>The Corsicans have been obliged to shew par∣ticular
force of spirit. The Swiss and the Dutch
were both assisted by powerful nations in the re∣covery
of their liberties: but during the long and
bloody war which Corsica has carried on, the Pow∣ers
of Europe, who might be supposed friendly to
her, have stood aloof, and she has single and un∣supported,
weathered the storm, and arrived at
the degree of consequence which she now holds.</P>
<P>To give an account of this island, is what I
am now to attempt. The attempt is surely lau∣dable;
and I am persuaded that my readers will
grant me every indulgence, when they consider
how favourable is the subject. They will consi∣der
that I am the first Briton who has had the
curiosity to visit Corsica, and to receive such infor∣mation
as to enable him to form a just idea of it;
and they will readily make allowance for the en∣thusiasm
of one who has been among the brave
islanders, when their patriotick virtue is at its
height, and who has felt as it were a communi∣cation
of their spirit.</P>
<P>The plan which I have prescribed to myself
is, to give a Geographical and Physical description
of the island, that my readers may be made ac∣quainted
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
with the country which in these latter
days has produced so heroick a race of patriots.
To exhibit a concise view of the Revolutions it
has undergone from the earliest times, which will
prepare the mind, and throw light on the sequel.
To shew the Present State of Corsica; and to sub∣join
my Journal of a Tour to that island, in
which I relate a variety of anecdotes, and treasure
up many memoirs of the illustrious General of the
Corsicans—MEMORABILIA PAOLI.</P>
<P>I do most sincerely declare, that I feel myself
inferiour to the task. But I hope the sketch which
I give, will be of some immediate service, and will
induce others to execute a more perfect plan. I
shall be happy if I contribute in a certain degree
to give the world a just idea of Corsica, and to in∣terest
the generous in its favour; and I would adopt
for this work a simple and beautiful inscription on
the front of the Palazzo Tolomei at Siena,

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Situation, Extent, Air, Soil, and Pro∣ductions,
of CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>CORSICA is an island of the Mediterranean
sea, situated between the 41 and 43 de∣gree
of north latitude, and between the 8 and 10
degree of east longitude, reckoning from London.
It hath on the north the Ligurian sea, and gulf
of Genoa. On the east, the Tuscan sea; on the
south, a strait of ten miles which separates it from
Sardinia; and on the west the Mediterranean. It
is about 100 miles south of Genoa, and 80
south-west of Leghorn, from whence it can plain∣ly
be seen when the weather is clear. It is 150
miles in length, and from 40 to 50 in breadth,
being broadest about the middle. It is reckoned
322 miles in circumference; but an exact mea∣surement
round it would extend to 500 miles,
as it is edged with many promontories, and with
a variety of bays.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
Pliny the elder hath given us a short, but very
accurate account of the geography of Corsica;
“In Ligustico mari est Corsica quam Graeci Cyr∣non
appellavere, sed Thusco proprior, a septen∣trione
in meridiem projecta, longa passuum CL
millia, lata majore ex parte L, circuitu CCCXXII,
civitates habet XXXIII et colonias Marianam a
Mario deductam, Aleriam a dictatore Sylla<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. ii. cap. 6.</NOTE>.
In the Ligurian sea, but nearer to Tuscany than
to Liguria, is Corsica, which the Greeks called
Cyrnus. It extendeth from north to south, and
is about 150 miles in length, for the most part
50 in breadth, and 322 in circumference. It
hath 33 states and two colonies, Mariana found∣ed
by Marius, and Aleria founded by the dicta∣tor
Sylla.” Of these 33 states, not above five
or six can now be traced; and the colonies are
only to be marked by their ruins. But the usual
fidelity of Pliny is to be credited in this account.
Pomponius Mela<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pomp. Mel. lib. ii. cap. 7.</NOTE> describes the situation of
Corsica, as does Ptolemy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ptol. Geog. lib. iii. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Seneca the philosopher hath left us two most
horrid pictures of Corsica, very false indeed, but
executed with uncommon strength of fancy and
expression. Stoick as he was, of a grave and se∣vere
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
demeanour, he did not escape the Emperour's
jealousy, but being accused as one of the many
gallants with whom the profligate Julia had been
guilty of adultery, he was banished to Corsica,
where he remained for seven years; and where
in the province of Capo Corso they still shew an
old ruin called “Il torre di Seneca, Seneca's Tower.”
Here he composed his books De Consolatione to
Polybius, and to his mother Helvia, with several
other works; and here he indulged his fretted
imagination in the following epigrams.</P>

<P>He hath also vented his spleen against the place
of his exile, in the same extravagant manner, in
his books De Consolatione. But we must consi∣der,
that notwithstanding all the boasted firmness
of Seneca, his mind was then clouded with me∣lancholy,
and every object around him appeared
in rueful colours.</P>
<P>Corsica is, in reality, a most agreeable island.
It had from the ancient Greeks the name of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Callista, on account of its beauty; and we
may believe it was held in considerable estimation,
since Callimachus places it next to his favourite
Delus,</P>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—CALLIM. Hymn. in Del. l. 19.</L>
<L>Next in the rank, Phoenician Cyrnus came,</L>
<L>A fruitful isle, of no ignoble name.</L></Q>
<P>It is charmingly situated in the Mediterranean,
from whence continual breezes fan and cool it in
summer, and the surrounding body of water keeps
it warm in winter, so that it is one of the most
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
temperate countries in that quarter of Europe. Its
air is fresh and healthful, except in one or two
places, which are moist, and where the air, espe∣cially
in summer, is suffocating and sickly; but in
general, the Corsicans breathe a pure atmosphere,
which is also keen enough to brace their fibres
more than one would expect under so warm a sun.</P>
<P>Corsica has indeed been pretty generally re∣presented
as unwholesome, which, I suppose, has
been owing to the bad report given of it by the
Romans, who established their colonies at Aleria
and Mariana, which from their damp situation,
occasioned a great death among the inhabitants,
and accordingly these colonies soon went to ruin.
But all the interiour parts of the Island have very
good air.</P>
<P>Corsica is remarkably well furnished with good
harbours, so that we may apply to it what Florus
says of the Campania, “Nihil hospitalius mari<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Flor. Lib. i. Cap. 16.</NOTE>.
Nothing more hospitable to the sea.” It has on
the north Centuri. On the west San Fiorenzo,
Isola Rossa, Calvi, Ajaccio. On the South it has
Bonifaccio. And on the east Porto Vecchio, Ba∣stia,
and Macinajo. Of each of these I shall give
some account.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Centuri, though at present but a small harbour,
may be greatly enlarged, as its situation is very
convenient.</P>
<P>San Fiorenzo is an extensive gulf. It runs
about fifteen miles up into the country, and is
about five miles across, and many fathom deep.
The gulf itself hath often a violent surge, being
exposed to the westerly winds; but there are seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al
creeks and bays, particularly on the south
side of it, which are quite secure. There is a
bay under the tower of Fornali, about two miles
from San Fiorenzo, which is highly esteemed,
and where vessels of considerable burden may be
safely stationed.</P>
<P>Isola Rossa is but a little harbour; but has a
considerable depth of water, and is defended by
a small island against the westerly winds. They
talk of erecting a mole to lock it in on every quar∣ter.
It is at present one of the principal ports for.
Commerce in the possession of the Corsicans.</P>
<P>Calvi<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Postlethwayt, in his translation of Savary's Dictionary of Trade and Commerce, has a most absurd observation con∣cerning Calvi: “Its inhabitants,” says he, “are called Calves.” Who told him this? What connection is there between the English word Calves and the Italian word Cal∣vi? Perhaps he intended it as wit. If so, how clumsy are the jests of this Lexicographer!</NOTE> is a large and excellent harbour.
Cluverius calls it “Celeberrimus insulae por∣tus
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cluver. Corsic. Antiq.</NOTE>, The most famous port of this island.”
The only objection I ever heard made to it, was
by a French Gentleman, who told me, that the
bottom of it was full of sharp rocks, which were
apt to cut the cables of ships which entered it:
and he instanced one of the transports, which had
landed some of the French troops in the year
1764. He however was under a mistake; for
I have been at pains to enquire very particularly
concerning this, and am informed from the best
authority, that there is nothing to fear from
rocks at Calvi, and that the French transport
which suffered a little there, happened to be run
foul of, by some of the rest, which was the oc∣casion
of any damage it sustained.</P>
<P>Ajaccio is a wide and commodious harbour,
with a good mole, and perfectly safe. It wants
only to have a small rock in front of the mole
removed, which might be done at no great
charge.</P>
<P>Corsica hath also in this quarter several smaller
havens, which are useful for the reception of
little vessels.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50"/>
Bonifaccio is an useful harbour, much fre∣quented
since the oldest times, and very fit for
trade.</P>
<P>Bastia is not a port of the first consideration, as
ships of war cannot enter it. But it hath a mole
for the convenience of small vessels, for which it
is very well fitted. The islands of Gorgona,
Capraja, and Ilva, or the Elbe, are placed at no
great distance in the sea which rolls between the
east coast of Corsica and Tuscany, with the Pope's
dominions; so that small vessels can never be at
a loss for protection, should any sudden storm
come upon them, as they can run into any of
these islands.</P>
<P>Macinajo is not one of the principal harbours
in Corsica, though it is very safe and commo∣dious
for vessels of a light construction. I men∣tion
Macinajo, because it was from thence that
the expedition set sail against Capraja, as will be
afterwards seen.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus celebrates Corsica for the ex∣cellency
of its harbours: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sicul. lib. v.</NOTE>, “The island being of very easy
access, has a most beautiful port, called the Sy∣racusian.”
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
This, which was anciently called the
Syracusian, has now the name of Porto Vecchio;
of which it is proper to take particular notice.</P>
<P>Porto Vecchio is a spacious haven, capable of
containing a very large fleet. It is five moles long,
above a mile and a half broad, has a great depth
of water, and a good bottom, and being land∣locked
on every side, is well sheltered from
storms. I may add, that nature has placed a high
and rocky mountain like a stately column to point
it out at a great distance. In short, Porto Vec∣chio
may vie with the most distinguished harbours
in Europe.</P>
<P>The only objection to it, is the badness of its
air, occasioned by the marshy grounds which lie
in its neighbourhood. But this disadvantage may
be remedied, as has been done at Leghorn.
“The country about Leghorn was formerly a vile
morass or rather quagmire, the noxious steams
of which rendered the air unwholesome; but
by the skill and pains of an Englishman, Sir
Robert Dudley, son to Queen Elizabeth's po∣tent
favourite the Earl of Leicester, the soil
was rendered habitable, the air much less un∣wholesome,
and the port improved, so as to
become the best in Italy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Present State of Europe, p. 411.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52"/>
From this account of the harbours of Corsica,
it will appear of how great consequence an alliance
with this island might be to any of the maritime
powers of Europe. For, a fleet stationed there
might command the navigation of Genoa, Tus∣cany,
and the ecclesiastical state, that between
Spain and Naples, and a good share of that to the
Levant; not to mention its influence over that of
Sardinia. And it may be material to observe, that
vessels stationed in the ports of Corsica might be
formidable to France, as the western side of the
island is directly opposite to the extensive coast of
Provence, on which a descent might be made with
cruisers in a very short time.</P>
<P>The northern point of Corsica, called Capo
Corso<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">There is a place in Guinea, which has also the name of Capo Corso: I know not from what. Cluver. Geog. p. 537.</NOTE>, is about 30 miles long, very mountain∣ous
and rocky, but covered with vines and olives.</P>
<P>There are, in several parts of the island, but
particularly in Capo Corso, a great many ancient
towers, built about three or four hundred years
ago, to defend the inhabitants against the incursi∣ons
of the Turks and other pirates. There is there
a little village called Tomino, strong by situation.
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
The Genoese have made several attacks upon it
during the late troubles, but were never able to
carry it. The inhabitants are very deservedly proud
of this. They shew, with particular triumph, a
shell which the enemy threw into their village, to
oblige them to surrender. They have placed it
in a niche on the outside of their church, to serve
as a memorial of their deliverance, and to inspire
them with greater zeal and devotion when they go
to divine worship.</P>
<P>From Tomino east to Bastia, is about 26 miles
of a country much diversified with hills, and
abounding in springs. On the coast are a number
of poor fishing towns, and a little up the country,
there are several villages or hamlets prettily
situated.</P>
<P>Bastia has of a long time been reckoned the
capital of Corsica. It was here that the Genoese
held the seat of their sovereign power: and indeed
Bastia is still the largest town in the island. It has
a stately appearance from the sea, being built on
the declivity of a hill; though upon entering the
town, one is a good deal disappointed; for the
houses are in general ill built, and the streets nar∣row,
and from the situation of the town, are ne∣cessarily
very steep. There are however several
pretty good buildings here. It hath a castle, which
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
commands the town and harbour, which, though
but a sorry fortification at present, is capable of
being made a place of considerable strength, as it
hath a range of hills behind it, on which little re∣doubts
might be erected; and with these, and a
few substantial outworks towards the sea, it might
stand a pretty long siege. The castle is properly
on a separate territory, called TERRA NUOVA, the
New Land, as is also the cathedral of Bastia,
which has nothing very remarkable. It belongs
to the bishoprick of Mariana.</P>
<P>The church of St. John in this city, by no
means an inelegant building, belongs to the Je∣suits,
who have here a college. Their garden is
finely situated, large, and well laid out. This they
owe in a great measure to the French, who have
been stationed in Corsica at different times. From
them the inhabitants have learned much of what
they know of the arts and conveniences of life.
There is here a convent of Lazarists or missiona∣ries,
a vast and magnificent house, almost over∣hanging
the sea. The convent of the Franciscans,
and that of the Capuchins, are situated on the
rising grounds behind Bastia. The last stands in
a beautiful exposure, and has really a very pretty
front.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55"/>
From Bastia south to beyond Aleria, is one
continued plain, between 50 and 60 miles in
length, proper for raising all sorts of grain, as well
as for pasturage.</P>
<P>I say nothing of the ruins of Mariana and A∣leria,
the two Roman colonies which stood on
this plain; for as Corsica was much disregarded
by the Romans, they did not think it worthy of
having any of their taste and magnificence em∣ployed
in it: so there are no vestiges of ancient
grandeur. As however, even the dregs of the
Romans could not be without some skill in the
arts, several antiques, such as rings, and seals with
engravings on precious stones have been found
here, and sometimes pretty good ones. The ruins
of an old town called Nicea, said to be built by
the Etruscans, are still to be seen on this plain,
but without any thing remarkable.</P>
<P>Beyond Aleria the country rises into small hills,
proper for vines, olives, mulberry trees, and many
of them for corn. It is traversed by some ridges
of mountains, upon which, not far from Porto
Vecchio, are great numbers of very fine oaks, the
best being to be found here, and at Campoloro.
A rich waved country with some few interrupti∣ons,
reaches along the east and south coasts to
Bonifaccio, which is a pretty considerable town,
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
well inhabited, and strongly fortified; and from
thence is continued to the plain of Ajaccio.</P>
<P>Ajaccio is the prettiest town in Corsica. It
hath many very handsome streets, and beautiful
walks; a citadel, and a palace for the Genoese go∣vernour.
The inhabitants of this town are the
genteelest people in the island, having had a good
deal of intercourse with the French. In Ajaccio
are the remains of a colony of Greeks settled in
Corsica, of which colony a particular account
shall be given in the next chapter.</P>
<P>From the plain of Ajaccio, after passing some
more ridges, you advance along the west shore to
the provinces of Balagna and Nebbio, which are
very rich, and afford an agreeable prospect, parti∣cularly
Balagna, which may be called the garden
of Corsica, being highly favoured by nature, and
having also had in a superiour degree the advan∣tages
of cultivation.</P>
<P>You next arrive at San Fiorenzo, which is but
an inconsiderable place, and of no great strength.
About a quarter of a mile to the southward of the
town, are some low marshy grounds, which make
San Fiorenzo so sickly, that few people choose
to inhabit it, and the garrison there must be chang∣ed
every month.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57"/>
On the northern shore of the gulf, are two or
three villages, of which the principal is Nonza.
This is properly the key of Capo Corso; because
from the cape into the interiour parts of the island
on the western side, there is only one pass, and that
leads through this place. Nonza is a little village,
on a high rock, on the extreme pinnacle of which,
some hundred fathoms above the gulf, and di∣rectly
perpendicular, stands a tower of small for∣tress,
which commands the avenue to it. Nonza
is literally what Cicero calls Ithaca, “In asperri∣mis
saxulis tanquam nidulum affixam<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cic. De Orat. lib. i. cap. 44.</NOTE>, Stuck
on the rudest cliffs like a little nest.” After this,
the cape begins, which finishes at Ersa.</P>
<P>I have thus reviewed the Corsican harbours, and
travelled round the skirts of the country, along its
shores.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus describes Corsica as an exten∣sive
island, very mountainous, abounding in large
forests, and watered with many rivulets: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sicul. lib. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58"/>
Indeed the interiour parts of the island are in
general mountainous, though interspersed with
fruitful valleys; but have a peculiar grand appear∣ance,
and inspire one with the genius of the place;
with that undaunted and inflexible spirit, which
will not bow to oppression. As Homer says of
Ithaca:</P>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L>
<L>Odyss. lib. ix. l. 27.</L>
<L>Strong are her sons, tho' rocky are her shores.</L>
<L>PoPe.</L></Q>
<P>The great division of Corsica, is into the DI
QUA, and the DI LA DEI MONTI, The country
on this side, and the country on the other side of
the mountains; reckoning from Bastia. By the
mountains is understood, that great range of them
which rises beyond Aleria, and stretches across
the island, intersecting it however by no means
equally; for, the country DI QUA is a third more
than that DI LA. Another old division of this
island was, to suppose a line drawn from Porto
Vecchio, to the gulf of San Fiorenzo; and the
division upon the east, was called BANDA DI
DENTRO, The side within; and that on the west,
was called BANDA DI FUORI, The side without. I
never could learn the meaning of this division
farther, than that, I suppose, those who inhabited
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
Bastia and the plain of Aleria, looked upon them∣selves
as the most civilized; and so were for calling
those on the opposite side of the island to them
“forrestieri, foreigners.”</P>
<P>The next division is into provinces, of which
there are nine; for althoug a great part of this
country long went under the denomination of
“FEUDOS, feus,” and is still called so in maps,
the jurisdiction of the signors is now gradually
wearing out, and will soon be sunk into the gene∣ral
power of the state.</P>
<P>Another division of Corsica is into PIEVES. A
Pieve is properly an ecclesiastical appointment,
containing a certain number of parishes, over
which is placed a PIEVANO, who superintends the
the priests, and draws a certain part of the tithes.
But this division is as much used for civil affairs,
as for those of the church.</P>
<P>There are large tracts of uninhabited land in
Corsica, mostly covered with woods; to some
parts of which the peasants resort in summer to
feed their cattle, and to gather chestnuts, mak∣ing
little sheds for themselves to lie under. There
is hardly such a thing as a detached farm-house
to be seen in the island, like what are scattered
every where over Great Britain; for, the Corsi∣cans
gather together in little villages, which they
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
call by corruption “PAESES, countries.” I re∣member
when I was first told in Corsica, that I
should travel a great miles “Senza veder
un paese, Without seeing a country,” I could
not conceive what they meant. The Corsicans
are in greater safety, and have more society with
each other by thus living in villages; which is
much the custom in the cantons of Switzerland,
and some parts of Germany; as it was anciently
among all nations.</P>
<P>The Corsican villages are frequently built up∣on
the very summits of their mountains, on crag∣gy
cliffs of so stupendous a height, that the
houses can hardly be distinguished during the
day; but at night, when the shepherds kindle
their fires, the reflection of such a variety
of lights, makes these aerial villages have a
most picturesque and pleasing appearance.</P>
<P>In the center of the islands Corte, which
is properly its capital, and will undoubtedly be
one day a city of eminence. Here is the Gene∣ral's
palace; and here is the supreme seat of jus∣tice,
where the executive power constantly resides,
and where the legislature is annually assembled;
and here also is the university, which in time may
become a distinguished seat of learning, though I
must not allow my enthusiasm to indulge itself in
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
too eager hopes of seeing Corsica an Athens, as
well as a Thebes.</P>
<P>Corte is situated part at the foot, and part on
the declivity of a rock, in a plain surrounded with
prodigious high mountains, and at the conflux of
two rivers, the Tavignano and Restonica. It
hath a great deal of rich country about it, and a
wonderful natural strength, being hemmed in by
almost impassable mountains and narrow defiles,
which may be defended with a handful of men,
against very large armies.</P>
<P>Upon a point of the rock, prominent above
the rest, and on every side perpendicular, stands
the castle or citadel. It is at the back of the
town, and is almost impregnable; there being
only one winding passage to climb up to it, and
that not capable of admitting more than two per∣sons
abreast. Thuanus thus describes it; “Cu∣riae
arx saxo fere undique praerupto imposi∣ta
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuan. Hist. tom. 1. p. 507.</NOTE>, The castle of Corte placed upon a
rock, broken and ragged almost on every side.”
In the year 1554, it was in possession of the
French.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> A Capitaine la Chambre betrayed
it, for which he was afterwards hanged at Mar∣seilles.
The same historian inform us, that after
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
the Corsicans had thus recovered the citadel of
Corte, it stood a siege by the French general de
Thermes, from August to October, and that it
was a scarcity of water, which at last occasioned
its surrender.</P>
<P>In the plain, on the north of Corte, there is
a convent of Capuchins, and on the side of the
hill, to the south of the City, there is a convent
of Franciscans. Here the General lived while his
palace was repairing; and here all strangers of re∣spect
are lodged. From this convent, one has
the best view of the city of Corte.</P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Messieurs Hervey
and Burnaby, when they were at this convent,
were greatly struck with the romantick appearance
of Corte.</P>
<P>“We could scarce help fancying ourselves at
Lacedemon, or some other ancient Grecian
City. Livy speaking of Heraclea, has given
a description of it very like Corte: “Sita est
Heraclea in radicibus Aetae montis, ipsa in
Campo, arcem imminentem loco alto et undi∣que
praecipiti habet. Lib. lxxxvi. cap. 22. He∣raclea
is situated at the foot of mount Aeta;
itself on a plain, but hanging over it, is a ci∣tadel,
on a cliff very high and steep on every
side.”. One would think he was speaking of the
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
very place. At Lacedemon indeed, as ap∣pears
from Pausanias, there was no Acropolis
or citadel, and they only called the highest
point or eminence in the city by that name;
from its answering probably the same pur∣pose
to them, as the Acropolis did to the other
cities of Greece, it being more difficult of access
to an enemy, and admitting of an easier defence.
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Pau∣san.
lib. iii. cap. 17. The Lacedemonians
have no citadel built upon a high place, like
Cadmaea of the Thebans, or Larissa of the
Argives. But as there are in the city many
hills, they give the most elevated of them the
name of the citadel. Upon this hill is a tem∣ple
to Minerva.” And Livy, speaking of its
being besieged by Flaminius, observes nearly the
same thing: “Altiora loca et difficiliora aditu
stationibus armatorum, pro munimento objectis
tutabantur. lib. xxxiv. cap. 38. The higher
places, and those more difficult of access, were
defended by detachments of soldiers which
served instead of fortifications.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64"/>
According to the institution of Lycurgus, the
Spartans were not allowed to have any fortifi∣cations;
but were to rely for their defence upon
their own valour. Towards the decline of the
Grecian liberty however, they erected walls in
the plainer and more open avenues; Locis
patentibus plerisque objecerunt murum, says
Livy. The remainder was still confided to the
valour of its citizens. However, notwithstand∣ing
this, there was sufficient likeness to form a
comparison between Corte and Lacedemon;
especially as the Acropolis was built upon; the
temple of Minerva being placed there. We
could not help imagining, that yonder was the
Taygetus, here the Eurotas; and what made
the comparison more striking, was the resem∣blance,
we fancied, between Lycurgus and
Paoli<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burnaby's Journal.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Corsica is extremely well watered. Its princi∣pal
lakes, are those of Ino and Crena, about two
miles from each other; both situated on the high∣est
mountain in the island, called by the ancients
Mons Aureus, and now Gradaccio or Monte Ro∣tondo.
It is of an amazing height, and may
equal any of the Alps. From the top of it there
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
is a most extensive view of all Corsica, of the
seas and of Sardinia, with distant prospects of
Italy and France; while the Mediterranean and
many of its little isles are also under the eye. But
people seldom go to take this view; for the up∣per
part of the monntain is almost a perpendicular
rock, so that a man must climb two miles with
the help of his hands and knees; and for the
greatest part of the year, this immense mountain
is covered with snow. These two lakes of Ino
and Crena, are both of considerable exte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>
<P>In the plain of Aleria, near to Mariana, is a
lake called Chiurlina or Biguglia, which is pretty
large, and communicates with the sea; and near
to Aleria, is a lake called Il Stagno di Diana,
which also communicates with the sea; and it is
remarkable, that in summer, when the heat of
the sun has exhaled part of the water, and the
rest of it is absorbed by the sandy bottom, there
remains a kind of natural salt, which the Cor∣sicans
find very good, and constantly make
use of.</P>
<P>The rivers of Corsica are, the Golo, a large
and beautiful river, which takes its rise from the
lake of Ino, traverses several provinces, and after
a course of above seventy miles, empties itself in∣to
the sea, just by the ancient city of Mariana.
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
The Tavignano, also a considerable river, which
takes its rise from the lake of Crena, and after
traversing a long tract of rude country, empties
itself into the sea, just by the ancient city of Ale∣ria.
The Restonica, which, though but a small
river, is famous in Corfica, on account of its par∣ticular
qualities. Its water is clear as chrystal,
and most agreeable to drink; so that Seneca cer∣tainly
never saw the Restonica, otherwise he
would never have said, that Corsica had not
“haustus aquae, a draught of water.” The Re∣stonica
is said to be of a mineral nature, and very
wholesome. It hath a virtue of whitening every
thing. The stones in its channel are like as ma∣ny
pieces of chalk. I remember on the road be∣tween
Rome and Naples, a run from a sulphure∣ous
spring, which had something of the same qua∣lity,
only it did not give so very white a tincture
as that of the Restonica, which will make iron
look almost like silver, and never rust. The
Corsicans frequently dip the barrels and locks of
their guns in it.</P>
<P>There are several other rivers, of which I shall
not give a particular description; the Prunella,
Fiumorbo, Gravonne, Valinco, Talavo, Lia∣mone;
fine poetical names. There are also a
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
great many rivulets, which serve to enrich the
country, and keep it constantly fresh.</P>
<P>It hath been said, that with proper care and
expence, some of the Corsican rivers might be
rendered navigable; but this, I think, would
be a very idle project; for their courses are
exceedingly rapid, and when there has been
a great deal of rain, the torrents which
tumble from the mountains often bring down
large fragments of rock, which would dash in pie∣ces
any vessels that they should encounter.</P>
<P>There are many mineral springs, both of the
hot and cold kind, in different parts of the island,
which the inhabitants of the country find to be
very efficacious for the cure of most distempers;
and people of skill, particularly some French phy∣sicians
have examined them by, a chymical analy∣sis,
and approved of them.</P>
<P>Corsica is extremely well supplied with fish.
I never indeed could hear of any other fish in
their rivers or fresh water lakes, except trout and
eel. These however are found in great plenty,
very fat, and of an uncommon size.</P>
<P>But the rich treasure of fish for Corsica, is in
its sea; for on all its coasts, there is the greatest
variety of all the best kinds, and in particular a
sort of ton or sturgeon, and the small fish called
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
Sardinas, which is of an exquisite taste. And in
several places, the Corsicans have beds of oysters,
remarkably large; of which they have not only
a sufficiency for their own consumption, but ex∣port
a great many to Italy.</P>
<P>From the earliest times, Corsica has been fa∣mous
for its excellent fish. Juvenal, when saty∣rising
the excessive luxury of the Romans in his
time, who brought every delicacy from the great∣est
distance, says,</P>
<Q><L>Mullus erit domini quem misit Corsica.</L>
<L>Juv. Sat. v. l. 92.</L>
<L>A precious mullet from the Corsick seas,</L>
<L>Nor less the master's pamper'd taste can please.</L></Q>
<P>And since I am talking of the productions of
the Corsican sea, I may observe, that they here
fish great quantities of coral, of all the three kinds,
white, red and black. But I shall say more of
this, when I come to the commerce of Corsica.</P>
<P>Corsica hath as great a variety of animals as
most countries. The horses here, are in general of
a very small breed. Procopius in his wars of the
Goths, says, they run about in herds, and were
little bigger than sheep<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE>. They are, however, re∣markably
lively, and very hardy; somewhat of the
nature of Welch ponies, or of the little horses cal∣led
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
shelties, which are found in the highlands and
islands of Scotland; though I have seen Corsican
horses of a very good size. The asses and mules
here, are also small, but very strong and wonder∣fully
agile in scrambling along the steep rocky
mountains; for there are hardly any made roads
in the island. My worthy friend Sir Alexander
Dick, whose publick spirit in promoting good
roads in an approved age, is well known to all his
countrymen, observed that this has been no loss to
the Corsicans during the time that they have been
employed only in defending themselves in a state of
natural freedom. Had their country been open
and accessible, they had been easily subdued by
regular troops. It was in a good measure owing
to her rugged hills, that ancient Scotland preserved
her independency.</P>
<P>The black cattle are larger in proportion than
the horses; but the greatest part of the island is
not very proper pasture for them; so in general,
they do not give much milk, and their beef is
lean and tough. There is not so great occasion
for milk in Corsica, as they make no butter, oil
supplying its place, as in Italy, and most warm
countries. They however make a good deal of
cheese in some pieves.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70"/>
There are here a vast number of goats, which
browse upon the wild hills, and put one in mind
of Virgil's Bucolicks, where mention is so often
made of this animal. Sheep are also very plenti∣ful,
and have fine feeding; so that their mutton is
as sweet and juicy as one could desire, and attones
for the badness of the beef.</P>
<P>The Corsican sheep are generally black, or of
a dusky colour; a white sheep being here and
there to be met with in a flock, as black ones are
amongst our sheep. The wool is coarse and hairy,
which the people of the country impute to their
sheep being of a mongrel race. They have had
thoughts of helping this, by importing a good
breed from England or Spain. But I have been
told by the breeders of sheep, that the quality of
wool is not so much owing to the kind of sheep,
as to the nature of their pasture; for those sheep,
who bear very rough fleeces when upon one farm,
will, when put upon another of a different soil,
bear fleeces exceedingly fine. It is very common
here, for sheep to have more horns than two:
many of them have six.</P>
<P>The forests of this island abound in deer.
And there is here a curious animal, called a Muf∣foli.
It resembles a stag, but has horns like a ram,
and a skin uncommonly hard. It is very wild, and
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
lives on the highest mountains, where it can hard∣ly
be approached, it is so nimble. It will jump
from rock to rock, at the distance of many feet,
and if hard chaced to the extremity of a cliff,
from whence it can reach no other, it will throw
itself over, and with surprising agility pitch upon
its horns, without receiving any hurt. Yet when
these creatures are taken young, they are very ea∣sily
tamed. M. de Marboeuf, the French com∣mander
at the time I was in Corsica, had then
one of them; and there are now two of them
at Shugborough in Staffordshire, the seat of
Mr. Anson, who has a rich assemblage of what
is curious in nature, as well as of what is elegant
in art.</P>
<P>The Corsican animals in general, appeared wild
to strangers. Polybius gives us a reason for it:
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polyb. hist. lib. xii.</NOTE>. “All the animals in the
island appear to be wild, on this account, that it is
so rude and steep, and so thick set with trees, that
the shepherds are not able to follow their flocks.”
The wild boar is found here in great plenty. In∣deed
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
their swine, which are very numerous, have
all a mixture of the wild breed, and being fed on
chestnuts, they are agreeable food.</P>
<P>The Corsicans are very fond of the diversion
of hunting the wild boar, for which there is here
a race of dogs, particularly excellent. They have
smooth hair, and are something between a mastiff,
and a strong shepherd's dog. They are large, and
exceedingly fierce; but when once they have tak∣en
an attachment, they are very faithful to their
master, watch him night and day, and are most
undaunted in his defence.</P>
<P>Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE> tells us, that there were in Cor∣sica,
apes wonderfully resembling men; and in∣deed,
this island, and all that quarter of Europe
before it was well inhabited, must on account of
its vicinity to Africa, have swarmed with apes. Of
these, however, there are at present no remains;
which is a proof, that different species of animals
migrate from one country to another, and when
their race wears out in a particular part of the
globe, it may be very numerous somewhere else.
Certain it is, that in many countries, the race of
several animals, well known there in ancient times,
is totally extinguished. But I am not inclined to
believe that our Creatour allows any of the various
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
creatures which his almighty hand hath formed,
to be absolutely annihilated.</P>
<P>There are hares enough in Corsica, but no
rabbits; though Polybius, when talking of the ani∣mals
of this island, says there are rabbits, and is
very minute as to their form and qualities; saying,
that at a distance, one would take them to be lit∣tle
hares, but when they are caught, a great diffe∣rence
is perceived, both in their appearance and
taste. There are here no wolves, nor any of the
larger wild beasts, unless foxes can be reckoned
so, which are here indeed extremely large and ra∣venous.
It is said, they not only destroy sheep,
but have been known to devour even foals.</P>
<P>There is also a variety of birds in Corsica; the
eagle, the vulture, wood-pidgeon, turtle, thrush,
blackbird, and many of the smaller species; and
plenty of game, as partridges, woodcocks, snipes,
and water-fowl in the lakes. The poor thrushes
and blackbirds too, must be reckoned as part of
the game, for they are very numerous; and from
there being a great quantity of the arbutus fruit in
the island, they are exceedingly fat, and are es∣teemed
a particular delicacy. It is barbarous to
destroy, for the mere luxury of the table, birds
which make such fine musick; surely their melo∣dy
affords more enjoyment, than what can be had
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
from eating them. They are, however, a very
common dish in the southern countries, particu∣larly
in France.</P>
<P>In general, it may be observed that this island
is so privileged by nature, that there is no poiso∣nous
animal in it. For although there are some
scorpions, their bite carries no venom. The crea∣ture
in Corsica, which approaches nearest to a
poisonous animal is a spider, of an extraordinary
size. Its bite will irritate, and inflame to a great
degree, and the swelling which it occasions, is very
alarming to one unacquainted with it; but it soon
goes away, and no bad consequences follow,
more than from the stinging of our bees. This
spider, has by some been mistaken for the famous
tarantula of the kingdom of Naples.</P>
<P>Trees grow remarkably well in Corsica. There
is here almost every sort of forest trees, but it is
principally adorned with pines of different kinds,
oaks, and chestnut trees. All of these are to be
found of a great size; some of the pines in parti∣cular,
are exceedingly lofty, and the chestnut tree
grows to a prodigious bigness.</P>
<P>There are extensive forests in different places.
That of Vico is most remarkable. There is in
Corsica, timber sufficient to maintain a very large
fleet, and the timber here, is much harder than one
<PB N="76" REF="75"/>
would expect in so southern a latitude, owing to the
rocky soil of the country, to the perpetual currents
of fresh air through its valleys, and to the tempera∣ture
that proceeds from some of its mountains
being half of the year in snow; and this is also one
great cause of the salubrity of the climate, in which
Corsica has much the advantage of Sardinia.</P>
<P>The Ilex, or ever-green oak, is very common
here, and gives the country a cheerful look even
in the depth of winter. The lemon, the orange,
the fig and the almond trees, are also frequent.
There are, however, few walnut trees, and the ap∣ple,
pear, plumb and cherry are not remarkably
good, which is probably owing to no care being
taken of them. Corsica has the pomegranate in
great perfection, also the Indian fig and the aloe;
which last is said to flower here, as well as in the
East.</P>
<P>The Corsican mountains are covered with the
arbutus or strawberry tree, which gives a rich glow∣ing
appearance as far as the eye can reach. Indeed
the island is very like the country which Virgil de∣scribes
as the seat of rural felicity:
<Q><L>Glande sues laeti redeunt, dant arbuta sylvae:</L>
<L>Et varios ponit foetus autumnus et alte</L>
<L>Mitis in apricis coquitur vindemia saxis.</L></Q>
<BIBL>VIRG. Georg. lib. ii. l. 520.</BIBL>
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
<Q><L>On fatning mast, the swine well pleas'd, are fed;</L>
<L>And every wood with arbutus is red.</L>
<L>Benignant autumn smiling on the fields,</L>
<L>All various fruits in rich abundance yields;</L>
<L>While ev'ry rocky mountain vines displays,</L>
<L>Whose grapes are mellow'd by the sun's warm rays.</L></Q>
The mulberry grows well here, and is not so
much in danger from blights and thunderstorms
as in Italy, and the south of France; so that
whenever Corsica enjoys tranquillity, it may have
abundance of silk. We must not omit the laurel,
to which Corsica has surely a very good claim.
The box tree is a very common plant here.
In most countries it is dwarfish, and generally
used only for hedges; but it grows to a good size
in Corsica, and may be reckoned a timber tree.
Bochart<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bochart Geog: Sac. pars i. lib. i. cap. 5.</NOTE> has very ingeniously shewn, that the
benches of the Tyrian ships, which according to
the common translation of Ezechiel, chap. xxvii.

brought out of the isles of Chittim, were most
probably made of Corsican box wood.</P>
<P>Theophrastus in his history of plants expati∣ates
on the wonderful size of the Corsican trees;

thick here; his expression is very strong:

<P>The different kinds of grain in Corsica, are
wheat, barley, rye, and millet; all of which grow
extremely well in several parts of the country.
There are no oats here, as indeed hardly ever in
any of the southern countries. They give their
horses and mules barley. The millet is excellent
in Corsica, and when mixed with rye, makes a
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
wholesome bread, of which the peasants are very
fond. Chestnuts may be reckoned a sort of grain
in Corsica; for they answer all the purposes of
it. The Corsicans eat them when roasted by way of
bread. They even have them ground into flour,
and of that they make very good cakes.</P>
<P>There is a vast quantity of honey produced in
Corsica; for the island has from the earliest times
been remarkable for its swarms of bees. When
it was subject to the Romans, a tribute was im∣posed
upon it of no less than two hundred thou∣sand
pounds of wax yearly<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xlii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. Indeed the lau∣rel,
the almond tree, and the myrtle, in the flow∣ers
of which, the bees find so much sweetness,
are very common here; and the hills are all
covered with wild thyme, and other fragrant herbs.
Yet its honey hath always been accounted bitter,
by reason of the boxwood and yew, as Diodorus
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sicul. lib. v. cap. 295.</NOTE> and Pliny<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. xvi. cap. 16.</NOTE> observe; which make Virgil's

<Q><L>To tuneful Nerva, who would verses send,</L>

<P>Many people think the bitterness which is in
the Corsican honey very agreeable. The reason
which Pliny assigns for the bitterness of the ho∣ney,
he also assigns for the excellence of the wax.
Having mentioned the Punick, the Pontick, and
the Cretan, he says, “Post has Corsica (cera) quo∣niam
ex buxo fit habere quandam vim medicami∣nis
putatur<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xvi. cap. 16.</NOTE>. After these, the Corsican wax,
because it is made from the box tree, is reckon∣ed
to have a certain medicinal virtue.”</P>
<P>There are in Corsica, a great many mines of
lead, copper, iron, and silver. Near to San Fio∣renzo
is a very rich silver mine, yielding above the
value of 5 l. sterling out of every 100 lib. weight
of ore. The Corsican iron is remarkably good,
having a toughness nearly equal to that of the pre∣pared
iron of Spain, famous over all the world.
It is said that the true Spanish barrels are made
of iron which has been worn and beaten for a long
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
time in heads of nails in the shoes of the mules,
who travel with a slow and incessant pace along
the hard roads. But a very small proportion of
the great quantity of Spanish barrels, which are
sold in all parts of Europe, can have this advan∣tage.
The metal of the Corsican barrels is little
inferiour to that of the generality of Spanish ones,
and they begin to make them very well.</P>
<P>An allusion has been drawn from the iron
mines, and the name of Corsica, to the charac∣ter
of its inhabitants. Hieronymus de Marinis,
a Genoese, who writes on the dominion and go∣vernment
of the republick, says of this island:
“Terrae viscera ferri fodinis affluunt, naturae cum
ipso Corsicae nomine in uno conspirantis prae∣judicio,
Corsi enim corde sunt ferreo, adeoque ad
sicam armaque prono<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Graev. Thesaur. Antiq. vol. I. p. 1410.</NOTE>. The bowels of the
earth abound in mines of iron; nature conspir∣ing,
by a sort of prejudice, to form a similarity
between the name<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Corsica, Cor-sica. COR, the heart; SICA, a stiletto, heart of steel.</NOTE> of Corsica and the tem∣per
of the people; for the Corsicans have hearts
of iron, and are therefore prone to arms and the
sword.” The Marquis D'Argens<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lettres Juives. let. 55.</NOTE> applies to
Corsica these lines of Crebillon:</P>
<Q><PB N="82" REF="81"/>

<P>I may add</P>
<Q><L>And virtue springing from the iron soil.</L>
<L>JOHN HOME.</L></Q>
<P>There are also mines of allum, and of saltpetre,
in several parts of Corsica.</P>
<P>There is here a kind of granite, extremely
hard, some of it approaching in quality to the
oriental granite, which was so famous at Rome,
and of which such noble columns are still remain∣ing,
said to have been brought from Egypt. I
fear it would be extravagant to conjecture, that
some of these columns may have been the produce
of Corsica; for, besides the perfection of the hiero∣glyphicks,
which prove them to have been in
Egypt, I question if such large pieces of granite
could be raised in Corsica. There is here like∣wise
porphyry, and a great variety of jasper.
The magnificent chapel of the grand duke of
Tuscany, at Florence, is finished with Corsican
jasper, with which its inside is elegantly incrusted,
and has a most beautiful appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82"/>
On the borders of the lake of Ino, they find
pieces of rock crystal, very clear, and with five
sides, as if they had been cut by a lapidary.
They find some of it too in the mountains of
Istria. It is so hard, that it strikes fire; and
the Corsicans frequently use it for flint to their
fulsils.</P>
<P>Near to Bastia, there is found a sort of mine∣ral,
called by the country people, petra quadrata,
because it is always found in little square bits.
It has much about the hardness of marble, has
a colour like iron-ore, and weighs like lead.
The Corsicans ascribe certain mystical virtues to
this stone, as appears from an old monkish distich
made in its praise:</P>
<Q><L>Petrae quadratae duro de marmore natae,</L>
<L>Innumeras dotes quis numerare potest!</L>
<L>Of the square stone of marble grown,</L>
<L>The virtues fell, what man can tell!</L></Q>
<P>From the description of Corsica, which I have
now given, it will appear to be a country of con∣siderable
importance. According to Mr. Temple∣man's
Tables, in his New Survey of the Globe,
the island contains 2520 square miles. It hath
a number of good harbours. Its air is excellent,
and its productions rich and various.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A concise View of the REVOLUTIONS which
CORSICA has undergone from the earliest
times.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH many distinguished authours
have, in conformity with the taste of the
age, rejected every inquiry into the origin of na∣tions,
and presented their readers with nothing but
what can be clearly attested; I confess, I am not
for humouring an inordinate avidity for positive
evidence. By being accustomed to demonstration,
or what approaches near to it, and at no time giv∣ing
any credit to what we do not fully compre∣hend,
we are apt to form a pride and insolence
of understanding; the mind acquires a hardness
and obstinacy, inconsistent with the true intention
of our faculties in this imperfect state, and is ren∣dered
unfit for the reception of many important
truths.</P>
<P>But not to deviate into metaphysical speculati∣on,
I have always thought, that even the dark and
fabulous periods are worthy of some attention.
The soundest heads among the ancients thought
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>
so; and their works are therefore more agreeable,
than if they had confined themselves to strict au∣thenticity.
The origin of every nation is, as Livy
says, “Poeticis decora fabulis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. Prooem.</NOTE>, Adorned with
poetical fables.” These are always amusing to the
imagination, when neither tedious, nor too extra∣vagant.
We love to be led on in a gradual pro∣gress,
and to behold truth emerging from obscu∣rity,
like the sun breaking through the clouds.
Such a progress makes a part of our own nature,
which advances from the dawnings of being in
our infancy, to greater and greater intelligence.</P>
<P>They, whose genius is directed to the study of
antiquities, besides the immediate delight which
such traditions afford them, are often able, from
hints seemingly detached and unimportant, to trace
the fundamental truth, and extend the bounds of
reality. Few indeed have that peculiar turn for
inquiry, to deserve the name of antiquarians. But
there is an universal principle of curiosity, with
respect to times past, which makes even conjec∣tures
be received with a kind of pleasing venera∣tion;
and although the great end of history is in∣struction,
I think it is also valuable, when it serves
to gratify this curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="87"/>
I shall therefore, in treating of the revolutions
of Corsica, go as far back as books will serve me;
though at the same time, I intend to give no more
than a concise recital, and am rather to shew my
readers what is to be seen, than to detain them
till I exhibit a full view of it.</P>
<P>The earliest accounts that we have of Corsica,
are to be found in Herodotus. He tells us, that
its first inhabitants were Phenicians; for, that Cad∣mus,
the son of Agenor, when wandering in quest
of Europa, fell upon this island, which was nam∣ed
Callista, and left there some of his countrymen,
with his own cousin Membleareus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 147.</NOTE>. He tells us,
that eight generations after this, Theras brought
a colony to the island, from Lacedaemon. This
Thereas<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 147.</NOTE> was originally of the race of Cadmus,
but, being uncle by the motherside to Eurysthe∣nes
and Procles, the two sons of Aristodemus,
<PB N="90" REF="88"/>
and, on that account, having governed the king∣dom
as their tutor; when they grew up, and be∣came
kings of Sparta, Theras scorning to live a
private life, and to be under the government of
his pupils, determined not to remain at Lacedae∣mon,
but to go and join his kindred in the island
of Corsica, then called Callista. Accordingly,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Ibid. et cap. 148.</NOTE>
he went thither with some chosen companions, not
with any intention to drive out the former inha∣bitants,
but, on the contrary, with most friendly
dispositions towards them.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89"/>
Sometime after this, the Minyae, a wandering
tribe, who had taken refuge among the Lacedae∣monians,
having become obnoxious, on account
of their aspiring views, were thrown into prison,
and condemned to die; but Theras persuaded
the Spartans to spare them, promising, that he
would carry them out of the country; and ac∣cordingly,
he carried them to the island of Callista,
to join the new colony which he had settled
there; and from him, the island was called
Thera.</P>
<P>These Minyae, though but a wandering tribe
among the Lacedaemonians, were, in reality, of
illustrious descent, being the posterity of the he∣roick
Argonauts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="90"/>
This account of the first peopling of Corsica,
is a very curious piece of ancient history. It is
indeed very probable, that the Phenicians, or the
Phoceans, where its original inhabitants; seeing
they were the first great navigatours in the western
part of the world, and sent out colonies to many
distant countries.</P>
<P>It afterwards got the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Cyr∣nus,
from the number of its promontories; and
Isidorus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Isidor. Origin. lib. xiii. cap. 6.</NOTE> relates the manner in which it got
the name of Corsica. According to him, Corsa,
a Ligurian woman, having often observed a bull
swim over to the island, and return much fatter,
she had the curiosity to follow him in a little ves∣sel;
and so discovered the island, with all its
beauty and fertility. Upon which the Ligurians
sent thither a colony; and from Corsa, who had
made the discovery, they called the island Corsi∣ca.
This is ludicrous enough; but we may trace
what has given rise to so extraordinary a fiction,
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
when we consider, that very probably, a people
from the opposite coast of Italy, either the Li∣gurians,
or the Etruscans, have taken possession
of Corsica.</P>
<P>Whatever may be in this conjecture, it is cer∣tain,
that its next masters were the Carthagini∣ans,
who extended their conquests over all the
islands of the Mediterranean. Aristotle relates a
most extraordinary piece of Punick policy, with
respect to Corsica. Finding that is was difficult
to keep the inhabitants in subjection, they ordered
the whole of the vines and olives in the island to
be pulled up, and forbid the Corsicans, under
the pain of death, to sow their fields with any
kind of grain, so that they might be kept in the
most absolute dependance; and, though possessed
of a very fertile territory, be obliged to resort to
Africa, to seek the bare necessaries of life. So
early was the cowardly and barbarous policy of a
trading republick exercised against this people.</P>
<P>Corsica next passed under the dominion of
Rome. In the first Punick war, and about the year
493 from the building of the city, Lucius Corne∣lius
Scipio conquered the island<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. Epit. lib. xvii. Flor. lib. ii. cap. 2.</NOTE>, being opposed
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>
by an army of Sardinians and Corsicans, headed
by Hanno, a Carthaginian general.</P>
<P>It appears however, that the Corsicans could
not bear subjection with patience, for they were
continually attempting to get free. Of this, we
have an instance in the epitome of the twentieth
book of Livy. We next find them engaged
against M. Pinarius the praetor, who slew 2000
of them, obliged them to give hostages, and took
them bound to pay a tribute of 100,000 lib. of
wax, every year<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xl. cap. 34.</NOTE>. Afterwards C. Cicereius
the praetor, was obliged to give them battle,
when 1700 of them were killed, and upwards of
1070 taken prisoners, and upon this occasion,
their annual tribute was increased to 200,000 lib.
weight of wax<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib. lib. xlii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. From these instances, we
may see that Corsica was formerly much more
populous than it is now, and that it hath been
able to furnish amazing quantities of honey. We
are told by Pliny, that Papyrius Naso first tri∣umphed
over the Corsicans, on the Alban
mount
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. v. cap. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has already been said, that the Romans
founded two colonies in Corsica. The island was,
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>
like their other provinces, governed by a praetor.
It was also made to serve for a place of exile;
and was very proper for what they called “Rele∣gatio
in insulam, banishment to an island.” But
the Romans never had a firm hold of this coun∣try,
where that spirit of liberty, which tyrants
call rebellion, was ever breaking forth.</P>
<P>On the irruption of the barbarous nations,
Corsica shared the same fate with the other do∣minions
of the ruined empire. It fell a prey
to the Goths, who established there the feudal
system, as they did in every other country to
which their arms penetrated. Some authours
say, that Corsica was conquered by Alarick,
the first king of the Goths; but according to Pro∣copius,
it was conquered by a detachment sent
out by Totilas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this period, the history of Corsica is for
many ages a continued series of wars, ravage and
destruction, by a variety of contending powers.
We are here very much in the dark, without any
sufficient clew to guide us. We find in many
authours detached remarks concerning the island;
but it is difficult to arrange them in tolerable
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>
order, since the dates are almost always uncer∣tain.</P>
<P>I shall however give a short view of what seems
to have been the progress of events.</P>
<P>When the power of the Saracens rose to that
height, of which we read with amazement,
they drove the Goths from Corsica, and main∣tained
the dominion there for a considerable
time.</P>
<P>It is believed, that they first gave the title of
kingdom to Corsica; and, to this day, the coat
armonial of the island bears a Moor's head on its
shield.</P>
<P>There are Moorish coins frequently dug up
in Corsica; and near to Ajaccio, are Saracen
tombs, which appear to have had some magnifi∣cence.
They are subterraneous vaults, supported
by stone pillars; and in them are found sepul∣chral
urns of an earthen composition, similar to
brick.</P>
<P>It would appear, that the Pope has always had
a view towards the annexation of Corsica to his
territories; and, that he at different times insti∣gated
the kings of Arragon, as well as the sove∣reigns
of France, to make against it, what in the
stile of those times was called a holy war; which
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>
kind of wars were always calculated to serve the
political views of the holy father.</P>
<P>At last, Corsica was actually conquered by one
of the kings of France; some say, by Pepin, and
others, by Charles Martel. The Corsicans shew
to this day, a fountain, called by the name of
Charles, in the pieve of Alesani, and, as they say,
on the spot where this gallant prince vanquished
the Moors.</P>
<P>By the kings of France, Corsica was resigned,
in a perpetual gift, to the holy see. The Sara∣cens
however, from time to time returned; so
that the pope had but a very feeble and uncertain
sway.</P>
<P>The Genoese availing themselves of the dis∣tracted
state of the island, had very early con∣trived
to settle a colony at Bonifaccio; and em∣boldened
by degrees, they landed troops on other
parts of the country, and began to bear a formi∣dable
appearance.</P>
<P>This could not fail to incense the court of
Rome, and to draw down upon them the thunders
of the Vatican, from whence the holy father used,
in those ages, to fulminate with serious effect
against the greatest powers in Europe. Accord∣ingly,
the Genoese were excommunicated by
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>
pope Gregory the seventh, which made them at
that time desist from their project.</P>
<P>In this fluctuating situation Corsica continued,
till one of the popes, but which of them histo∣rians
are not agreed, sent thither Hugo Colonna,
a nobleman of Rome, accompanied by several
others of the Roman nobility, with a good force
under his command, in order to expel the infidels
from the island. When Colonna landed, he was
joined by many of the inhabitants, who, during
the struggle which had been subsisting so long,
and with such violence, had again and again en∣deavoured
to maintain themselves in a state of
freedom, and had elected a certain number of
chiefs, to whom they gave the title of caporali.</P>
<P>These caporali gave all the aid in their power
to Colonna; and, by their influence over the peo∣ple,
they soon brought together such a body of
men, that Colonna was enabled totally to rout
the Saracens, and to dispossess them for ever.</P>
<P>The Moors being rendered desperate by this
unexpected blow, were forced to quit the island;
but before they went, they burnt all that they
possibly could; and to this we must greatly im∣pute
the desolation which is yet to be seen in
Corsica, and the destruction of their ancient mo∣numents
and publick archives.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="97"/>
Hugo Colonna settled in Corsica, having ob∣tained
from the Pope distinguished honours and
extensive grants. The family of Colonna is one
of the most illustrious, and most ancient in the
world. So early as the 1200, mention is made
of Pietro Colonna, the eight of the name. The
branch which settled in Corsica, continued long
in great splendour, enjoying the noble fief of
Istria; but, by the confusions and troubles which
the island has been thrown into, by the bloody
contests between the Genoese and the patriotick
Corsicans, that family hath suffered prodigiously,
and its possessions are reduced to a very narrow
compass. The present head of the family, is a
worthy, sensible man, and very zealous in the
great cause. I was lodged in his house at Solla∣carò,
where I found Pascal Paoli.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the Corsican counts, mar∣quisses
and barons, derive their origin from this
period; for I can see no time so proper for their
first taking place here.</P>
<P>The island remained for some time in tolerable
quiet. But partly from the dissensions of diffe∣rent
parties among themselves, ever impatient of
contradiction, and partly from the repeated at∣tacks
of the Genoese, whose hankering after this
little kingdom still continued, there were such
<PB N="100" REF="98"/>
disorders, and such a defect of good government,
that the Pope thought proper to make it over to
the Pisans, who were then in great power.</P>
<P>This grant was upon advantageous terms for
the holy father, like the many grants of fiefs
which he used to give to various princes, to be
held of the see of Rome. A learned Professour
of the university of Pisa, has composed a very cu∣rious
dissertation concerning the ancient dominion
of his countrymen over Corsica. It is to be found
in the 7th volume of the Essays of the Acade∣my
of Cortona.</P>
<P>The Pisans, while their republick flourished,
and their force was considerable, maintained their
authority over Corsica to very good purpose; and,
as far as we can gather from different authors,
the island enjoyed more repose and tranquillity
during this period, than it has ever been known
to enjoy.</P>
<P>But this calm was of short endurance; for the
Genoese, irritated to find themselves now ef∣fectually
excluded from an island on which they
had long set their hearts; and being, over and
above, the determined rivals of Pisa, a keen
and obstinate war was carried on between these
states; at last, the Genoese prevailed, in the fa∣mous
sea-fight at Malora, near the mouth of the
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>
Arno; after which, they got entirely the mastery
of Pisa, and so were at length enabled to seize
upon Corsica, about the beginning of the four∣teenth
century.</P>
<P>Thus were the Corsicans, for the first time,
brought under the power of the Genoese; with
whom they have since had such struggles for that
freedom, which they appear to have at all times
attempted to recover.</P>
<P>If I have erred in any part of this recital, I
am sure it is without any intention. I know some
Genoese writers have maintained, that a signor
Ademar, of their nation, was employed in the
first conquest of the island by the kings of France.
I confess I do not see sufficient authority for this.
But supposing it had been so, Ademar could on∣ly
be an officer under the French king. We are
certain, that the French king made the conquest,
because he afterwards made a gift of the island to
the pope.</P>
<P>But I would not dwell long upon such dis∣quisitions.
There are many pieces lately pu∣blished,
both by the Corsicans and the Ge∣noese;
in which the authours, with great labour,
endeavour to refute each others hypotheses with
regard to many ancient facts in the history of
Corsica. Here indeed, there is full scope for all
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
parties; since those periods are so obscure, that
every writer may fill them up according to the
turn of his imagination; just as people who are
abroad in a dark night, may with equal keenness,
and equal appearance of reason affirm, that they
see objects totally different.</P>
<P>Let Corsica have been the property of the
Phenicians, the Etruscans, the Carthaginians, the
Romans, the Goths, the Saracens: let it have been
a conquest of France; a gift from that kingdom
to the pope; a gift again from the pope to the
Pisans, and at length a conquest of Genoa; still
we must have recourse to the plain and funda∣mental
principle, that the Corsicans are men, and
have a right to liberty; which, if usurped by any
power whatever, they have at all times a just title
to vindicate.</P>
<P>In reviewing these strange and rapid revolu∣tions,
which this island has undergone, we may
join with Seneca<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Seneca de consolatione.</NOTE> in reflecting on the muta∣bility
of human affairs, and be silent on the
changes which happen to individuals, when we
contemplate the vicissitudes of a whole nation.</P>
<P>The Genoese having obtained the undoubted
possession of Corsica, they were eager to enjoy
their power, and thought they could not fully
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>
enjoy it, but by exercising the most severe do∣minion.
What we have long anxiously desired,
acquires in our minds an imaginary and extrava∣gant
value; and when we actually become pos∣sessed
of it, a moderate and reasonable fruition,
seems insipid and unsatisfactory to our heightened
expectations. We are even, as it were, uncertain
if we really have it. And generally, we never rest,
till by abusing our powers, we destroy what we
esteemed so highly.</P>
<P>An individual, who acquires a large fortune,
and a state, which acquires an increase of domi∣minion,
may be very properly compared. He who
gets a large fortune, thinks he cannot shew his
command of riches, but by such acts of profu∣sion,
as must quickly dissipate them. And a
state, which has acquired an increase of domini∣on,
thinks its sovereignty is not sufficiently
manifested, but by such acts of arbitrary op∣pression,
as must tend to force its subjects to
throw off their allegiance. For however a people
may, from indolence, from timidity, or from
other motives, submit for a season to a certain
degree of tyranny; if it is long continued, and
pushed to an exorbitant length, nature will re∣volt,
and the original rights of men will call for
redress.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102"/>
The Genoese were the worst nation to whom
Corsica could have fallen. The Corsicans were
a people, impetuous, violent and brave; who
had weathered many a storm; and who could not
have been governed, but by a state of which they
stood somewhat in awe, and which, by humanity
and proper encouragement, might have conciliat∣ed
their affections. Whereas, the Genoese were a
nation of republicans just in the neighbourhood
of the islanders; who had long been their ene∣mies;
who had made so many cunning, and im∣potent
attempts to seize upon the island, that al∣though,
by the unexpected course of events, they
were now masters of it, the Corsicans could not
look upon them with any respect. And as it has
been always remarked that the foreign subjects
of a little republick, are much worse used, than
those of a great kingdom; they had reason to
expect nothing but avowed tyranny from Ge∣noa.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Genoese, who were them∣selves
in an unstable, and perilous condition,
seeking the protection sometimes of one pow∣erful
state, and sometimes of another, did not
treat the Corsicans with that gentleness and
confidence, which alone could have secured their
attachment and obedience, by insensibly leading
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>
them to a participation of the culture and fe∣licity
of civil life, and accustoming them to con∣sider
the Genoese as their fellow subjects, and
friends.</P>
<P>They took a direct a contrary course; and,
although they did not use so desperate a mea∣sure,
as that of the Carthaginians, their oppres∣sion
was heavy; their system was not to ren∣der
the Corsicans happier and better, but by
keeping them in ignorance, and under the most
abject submission, to prevent their endeavouring
to get free; while Genoa drained the island of all
she could possibly get, choosing rather even to
have less advantage by tyranny, than to have a
much greater advantage, and risk the consequences
of permitting to the inhabitants the blessings of
freedom.</P>
<P>In this unhappy situation was Corsica. Often
did the natives rise in arms; but having no head
to direct them, they were immediately quelled.
So apprehensive however were the Genoese, that,
according to their own historian Filippini, they
burnt 120 of the best villages in Corsica, while
4000 people left the island.</P>
<P>What shewed the Genoese policy in the worst
light, and could not but be very galling to the
Corsicans who remained at home, was, that many
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>
of these inslanders, who had gone over to the
continent, made a distinguished figure in most
of the European states, both in learning, and in
arms.</P>
<P>About the 1550, Corsica revived under the
conduct of a great hero, who arose for the de∣liverance
of his country. This was Sampiero di
Bastelica. He early discovered extraordinary parts
and spirit; and had the advantage of being edu∣cated
in the house of cardinal Hypolitus de Me∣dicis,
the nephew of pope Clement the seventh.
He was created colonel of the Corsicans in France,
and distinguished himself in almost every one
of the great actions of that nation in his
time.</P>
<P>After the death of Francis the first, he went
home to his native country; where he married
Vannina, heiress of the house of Ornano, of the
most ancient and rich of the Corsican nobility;
and from this time, he was generally called Sam∣piero
di Ornano.</P>
<P>Being moved with the miserable state of his
countrymen, he resolved to procure them relief;
and for this, a very favourable opportunity then
presented itself.</P>
<P>Here history begins again to open upon us.
The clouds of antiquity, and barbarism are dis∣persed,
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
and we proceed clearly, under the guidance
of the illustrious Thuanus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuan. Hist. lib. xii. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>France had of a long time claimed a right o∣ver
Genoa; but after the battle of Pavia, when
the French were forced entirely to abandon Italy,
that claim had become of no effect. Henry the
second however, having commenced a new war in
Italy, against the emperour Charles the fifth, re∣solved
to assert his power in Corsica; Sampiero di
Ornano encouraged this disposition, that he might
avail himself of it, to free the island from a yoke
which galled it so much.</P>
<P>He represented to Henry, that as the Genoese
had taken part with the emperour, his majesty
was debarred from all entrance to Italy by sea;
whereas, by putting himself in possession of Cor∣sica,
he might have a free passage through the Me∣diterranean,
and might, at the same time, employ
that island as a commodious garrison, where troops
and warlike stores might be lodged, to be from
thence thrown in upon Naples or Tuscany, as the
situation of affairs should require.</P>
<P>An expedition was therefore ordered to Corsi∣ca,
in the year 1553, under the command of
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>
general Paul de Thermes, accompanied by Sam∣piero
di Ornano, Jourdain des Ursins, and several
other able commanders. Henry had also the
Turks joined with him in this expedition, having
prevailed with their fourth Emperour, Solyman,
styled the magnificent, to send out a large fleet to
the Tuscan sea<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knowles's history of the Turks, p. 757.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This expedition was powerfully opposed by
the Genoese; who had given Corsica in charge
to their celebrated bank of St. George. The great
Andrew Doria, though then in his eighty seventh
year, bid defiance to age and infirmities, and, since
Corsica was an object of importance to his coun∣try,
the gallant veteran embarked with all the spi∣rit
of his glorious youth, having a formidable ar∣mament
under his command.</P>
<P>The war was carried on with vigour on both
sides. At first however, several of the best towns
were taken by the French and Turks, particular∣ly
Ajaccio, where were a number of merchants,
whose riches afforded good pillage to the enemy,
and helped to make the enterprise go on with more
spirit. The Corsicans joined in the common cause;
and the greatest part of the island was once fairly
delivered from the tyrant.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107"/>
But the Genoese were so well commanded by
the intrepid Doria, and had besides such assistance
from Charles the fifth, who sent strong reinforce∣ments
both of Spanish and German troops, that
the expedition was not entirely effectual.</P>
<P>In the course of this war, so many valourous
actions were performed, that, fired with the con∣templation
of them, I am almost tempted to for∣get
the limited bounds of my plan, and of my
abilities, and to assume the province of an histo∣rian;
I hope a Livy, or a Clarendon, shall one
day arise, and display to succeeding ages, the Cor∣sican
bravery, with the lusture which it deserves.</P>
<P>The Corsicans were now so violent against the
Genoese, that they resolved with one accord, that
rather than return under the dominion of the repu∣blick,
they would throw themselves into the arms
of the great Turk. At length however, a treaty
was concluded between the Corsicans and Geno∣ese,
advantageous and honourable for the former,
having for guarantee, his most Christian Majesty.</P>
<P>But, as there was an inveterate, and implacable
hatred between those two nations, this treaty did
not long subsist; and upon Henry's death, the
same oppression as formerly, became flagrant in
Corsica.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="108"/>
Sampiero di Ornano, who had been again for
sometime in France, having lost his royal master,
went himself to the Ottoman Porte, and earnestly
solicited fresh assistance to his unhappy nation.
But the face of affairs was changed. The same
political views no longer existed; and it must be
a miracle indeed, when states are moved by vir∣tuous
principles of generosity. This brave man,
being unsuccessful at Constantinople, returned to
Corsica, where his presence inspired the islanders
with fortitude, and occasioned a very general revolt.</P>
<P>He carried on his glorious enterprise with con∣siderable
effect; and the more so, that, as he had
now no foreign assistance, he was not looked
upon as very formidable, and the republick made
little preparation against him. But he was stop∣ped
in his career by the treachery of the Genoese,
who had him basely assassinated, by a wretch of
the name of Vitolli<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Michael Metello, who writes a particular history of the Corsican revolt under Sampiero, gives a different account of his death. He will have him to have been killed from mo∣tives of private revenge, by his brother in law, Michael An∣gelo di Ornano. But, besides the improbability that Vannina, the spouse of Sampiero, had a brother, when it is certain she inherited the family domains; I own, that the assassination, as related by several other authours, appears to me so much of a piece with the oppressions of Genoa, both before and since, that I give it the preference.</NOTE>, in the year 1567.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="109"/>
Thus fell Sampiero di Bastelica di Ornano, a
Corsican worthy of being ranked with the most
distinguished heroes. He displayed great bravery
and fidelity in foreign service; and with unremit∣ting
constancy endeavoured to restore the liber∣ties
of his country. Thuanus calls him “Vir
bello impiger et animo invictus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuani Hist. lib. xli. cap. 31.</NOTE>, A man active
in war, and of a spirit invincible.” The shades
which were in his private conduct, are to be for∣gotten
in the admiration of his publick virtues. His
son Alphonso, and his grandson John Baptist, both
arrived at the dignity of mareschal of France,
after which his posterity failed.</P>
<P>Alphonso di Ornano, who had been brought
up in the court of Henry the second, kept alive
the patriotick struggle for a short while; but un∣able
to make head against the republick, he re∣tired
from the island and settled in France.</P>
<P>The Genoese were thus again put in posses∣sion
of Corsica. Enraged at what they had suf∣fered
from a daring rebellion, as they termed it;
and still dreading a new insurrection, they thought
only of avenging themselves on the Corsicans; and
<PB N="112" REF="110"/>
plunging that people still lower than ever, in ig∣norance
and slavery.</P>
<P>Their oppression became now, if possible,
worse than before. They were inflamed with hot∣ter
resentment, and their tyranny formed itself
into something of a regular system. Forgetful of
every equitable convention that France had esta∣blished,
they exercised, without controul, the ut∣most
rigours of arbitrary power. They permit∣ted
nothing to be exported from the island, but
to Genoa, where, of necessity, the Corsicans were
obliged to sell their merchandise at a very low
rate; and in years of scarcity, the island was
drained of provisions by a sort of legal plunder.
For the inhabitants were forced to bring them to
Genoa, so that actual famine was often occasioned
in Corsica.</P>
<P>The Genoese did every thing in their power to
foment internal dissensions in Corsica, to which
the people were naturally too much inclined.
These dissensions occasioned the most horrid blood∣shed.
They reckon that no less than 1700 Cor∣sicans
were assassinated in the space of two years.
Assassinations were, in the first place, a certain
cause of hatred among the Corsicans, and often
between the best families, so that they would not
unite in any scheme for the general liberty. And
<PB N="113" REF="111"/>
in the second place, they could be turned to very
good account, either by confiscating the estates of
the assassins, or by making the criminals pay heavy
compensations to the judge. The judge could
wave the pursuit of justice by saying, “Non pro∣cedatur,
Let there be no process;” which could
easily be cloaked under the pretence of some de∣fect
in point of form; or could even acquit the
deepest offenders from his own will alone, by what
was called “Ex informata conscientia, The infor∣mation
of his own conscience;” of which he was
not obliged to give any account.</P>
<P>It was not till the year 1738, that Genoa made
an edict against this most dreadful abuse.</P>
<P>M. De Montesquieu thus writes concerning it,
with that calm dignity which becomes so great a
master: “Une république d'Italie tenoit des insu∣laires sous son obéissance; mais son droit politique
et civil a leur égard étoit vicieux. On se souvient
de cet acte d'amnistie, qui porte qu'on ne les con∣damneroit
plus à des peines afflictives sur la con∣science
informée du gouverneur. On a vu sou∣vent
des peuples demander des privileges; ici le
souverain accorde le droit de toutes les nations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Esprit des Loix, edit. Edin. liv. x. cap. 8.</NOTE>.
A republick in Italy held a nation of islanders
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>
under her obedience. But her political, and ci∣vil
constitution among them, was bad. We re∣member
that act of amnesty, which bears, that
they should no more be condemned to afflictive
pains, upon the informed conscience of the go∣vernour.
We have often seen people asking pri∣vileges.
Here, the sovereign is pleased to grant
the common right of all nations.”</P>
<P>During this oppression, it was common to con∣demn
multitudes to the galleys, for frivolous offen∣ces,
that they might purchase their liberty at a high
price; and it is hardly possible to conceive greater
barbarity, than what these islanders now endured.</P>
<P>The Genoese sent to Corsica a commissary ge∣neral,
or governour over the whole island; whose
office continued for two years. He was generally a
nobleman of desperate fortune, who by shameful
extortions, returned home in opulence; and by his
interest in the senate, prevented any inquiry being
made into his conduct. For although the unhap∣py
Corsicans offered many complaints to the re∣publick,
they were instantly stifled; which was
not difficult to do, as the Corsicans were consider∣ed
to be so turbulent and mutinous, that no ad∣ministration
could please them; and as every sena∣tour
who was to give his vote, did not know, but
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>
by extravagance, he himself might one day be
obliged to have recourse to the same expedient.</P>
<P>The commissary general had his residence at
Bastia. There were also other commissaries at Cal∣vi,
Ajaccio and Bonifaccio; and Lieutenants, and
inferiour officers, dispersed over the island; who
all in their several stations, contributed to rob, and
to ruin the country; while they triumphed in a
mean security, that as Corsica was overlooked, and,
as it were, hid in a corner of Europe, their inju∣rious
proceedings were not known to the world.</P>
<P>During this period of secret, and cruel oppres∣sion,
there happened a very curious event, the
establishment of a colony of Greeks in Corsica;
of which I shall now give an account.</P>
<P>After Mahomet and his successours had subdued
almost the whole of ancient Greece, and Scander∣beg,
who so gloriously defended his country, was
dead; there still remained a few brave souls who
inhabited a part of Peloponnesus of old, now the
kingdom of Morea. This part was, what is cal∣led
a branch of the Maina, the very spot where
Lacedemon stood.</P>
<P>Here, covered by impassable mountains, with
only a small entrance, they resisted the Ottoman
empire, as Leonidas formerly resisted the millions
of Xerxes.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114"/>
But when the Turks got possession of the isle
of Candia, in 1669, they came by sea, and made
a descent upon Maina, penetrated into the heart
of the territory, and soon became masters of it;
and then, the unfortunate posterity of the Spar∣tans,
were reduced to a state, little better than sla∣very.
Exorbitant taxes were imposed upon them;
their finest women were forced away to the sera∣glios;
and towers were built in different parts of the
country, where troops were garrisoned, to keep
them in awe; so that they had no hope of delive∣rance.
Their spirits gradually sunk, and many of
them embraced the faith of the Koran.</P>
<P>Still, however, a spark of the ancient fire was
preserved amongst those, who dwelt at Porto Vi∣tilo;
who, despairing to see any change in their
dejected country, came to the resolution of aban∣doning
it altogether, and of seeking an establish∣ment
somewhere else.</P>
<P>With this view, they sent to Italy, deputies who
had some acquaintance with the different states,
and who were intrusted by the community to look
out for a convenient settlement, and to conclude
the terms of a convention.</P>
<P>The Genoese sent them over to Corsica, where
they were shewn a tract of ground, belonging to
the chamber of the state, on the western side of
<PB N="117" REF="115"/>
the island, about three miles from the sea. The
deputies were very well pleased with it; and, on
their return to Genoa, they entered into an agree∣ment
with the republick.</P>
<P>They then went home to Greece, and having
made a report to their countrymen, the plan was
approved of; and, in the month of October,
1676, these “Tristes reliquiae Danaum, Sad re∣mains
of the Greeks,” embarked, in all about
1000 souls. The family of Stefanopoli was the
most distinguished among them, and conducted
the whole enterprise.</P>
<P>They arrived at Genoa, in the month of Janu∣ary,
1677, where they remained, till the month
of March. The republick paid all the expence
of their freight, and afforded them lodging and
subsistence, till they were safely landed in Corsica.</P>
<P>The conventions entered into, were, that the
Genoese granted to the Greeks, the territories of
Paomia, Ruvida and Salogna, in perpetual fief.
They furnished them with houses, with grain,
and with cattle; and engaged to maintain a body
of Genoese soldiers to defend them against all in∣sults,
for the first years of their residence. They
also appointed a Genoese gentleman, with the
title of Directour, as judge over them, whose office
was to be biennial, so that it should go by rotati∣on,
<PB N="118" REF="116"/>
among the Genoese nobility; and they agreed
to support, at the expence of the republick, a vi∣car,
skilled in the Greek language, who should
instruct their children in different studies; and, at
the same time, celebrate mass, and preach in the
chapel of the directour.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Greeks obliged them∣selves
to cultivate the lands, and with all expedi∣tion,
to discharge the debts they should incur to
the republick, for supplying them with every ne∣cessary,
in the infancy of their colony. They also
obliged themselves, to pay to the republick, a tax
of five livres, for every family, besides a tenth of
all their productions, and to be ready to serve the
republick, either by sea, or land, whenever their
service should be required.</P>
<P>Thus, was this colony settled. They enjoyed
the free exercise of their own rites of religion,
according to the Greek church, having brought
with them the bishop of Porto Vitilo.</P>
<P>They had also brought with them, some re∣ligious,
of the order of St. Basil, the only order
in their church; who established a convent in a
wild and romantick valley. But the Genoese did
not approve of these fathers; and, in a short time,
their convent was shut up.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="117"/>
The Greeks found themselves very easy and
happy, for a good many years. By their indus∣try
and activity, they beautified and enriched
their possessions, and built very good houses,
doing every thing with a taste, altogether new in
Corsica.</P>
<P>But their neighbours, the natives of the island,
did not live in great harmony with them. Per∣haps,
in this, envy may have had some share; for
their vines and their olives, their herds and their
flocks, were, by care and skill, much superiour
to those of the Corsicans. But besides, the island∣ders
looked upon the Greeks as auxiliaries of the
Genoese, to whom they, from time to time, swore
fidelity; and were ever ready to give their assis∣tance.
They also knew, that the Greeks were
well supplied with arms; and therefore, there
were frequent skirmishes between them and the
peasants of the province of Vico, of which their
territories had formerly made a part; and in the
year 1729, when the nation rose against the Ge∣noese,
the Greeks were seriously attacked; and
many a desperate battle they fought with great
bravery. The Genoese formed three regular
companies of them, to whom they gave pay;
and they were always employed in the most dif∣ficult
enterprises. In particular, they were de∣tached
<PB N="120" REF="118"/>
to attempt taking the castle of Corte from
the patriots; on which occasion, they were sorely
defeated, and a great number of them were kil∣led.</P>
<P>After various struggles, which the plan of this
work does not allow me to relate, the Greeks
were forced to leave their possessions, and retire
to Ajaccio, where they now support themselves
tolerably by their labour: and being convinced
of the tyranny of the Genoese, wait with im∣patience
for their total expulsion from the island;
and hope from the generosity of Paoli and the
Corsicans, that protection and encouragement
which they deserve.</P>
<P>This colony has been sober, virtuous and in∣dustrious;
and if they have acted in a hostile man∣ner
against the nation, it was from a good prin∣ciple;
from the fidelity which they owed to the
republick that had granted them an asylum;
which fidelity they would ever have preserved,
had not the republick included them in the gene∣ral
oppression. I must observe of this colony, that
it hath had the honour of producing an excellent
physician, Signor Giovanni Stefanopoli, the first
who hath had the wisdom and the spirit to bring
inoculation into practice in Corsica, by which he
preserves multitudes of lives; and may therefore
<PB N="121" REF="119"/>
be justly reckoned a distinguished benefactor to
the state.</P>
<P>Long despised, plundered and oppressed, the
Corsicans again revived in 1729, when the war
commenced, which, with some intervals, has con∣tinued
till now; and after so many changes, mis∣fortunes
and struggles, will probably fix on a so∣lid
basis the Corsican liberty.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to see how great events are
produced by little causes. A late authour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Monsieur Richer.</NOTE> hath
given us an entertaining selection of such instan∣ces,
from the histories of different nations. The
rise of the Corsicans in 1729, was occasioned
by a single paolo, a piece worth about five pence
English. A Genoese collector, went to the house
of a poor old woman, and demanded this trifling
sum, as the money for which she was assessed.
Being in extreme penury, she had not wherewithal
to satisfy the demand. Upon which, the collector
began to abuse her, and to seize some of her fur∣niture.
She begged him to have patience, and
said, she hoped in a few days to be able to pay
him. He persisted in his severity, and the poor
woman made a great lamentation. Two or three
people hearing the noise, entered the house, took
the part of the woman, and exclaimed against the
barbarity of the collector. He threatened them
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
with punishment, for having hindered him in the
execution of his office. This provoked the vil∣lagers,
and they drove him away with stones.
The Genoese sent troops to support their collec∣tor,
and the Corsicans assembled in large bodies
to defend themselves. The tumult encreased.
A spark was sufficient to kindle the generous
flame, in a people, who had so often glowed with
the enthusiasm of liberty; and in a very short
time, the whole island was in motion.</P>
<P>The Corsicans immediately rushed upon the
capital, which they took almost without resistance;
and they would have been masters of the castle of
Corte, had they been a little better regulated.</P>
<P>They saw it was necessary to put themselves
under the direction of certain chiefs. They there∣fore
chose Signor Andrea Ceccaldi, one of the
highest nobility in the kingdom, and Signor Luiggi
Giafferi, not indeed of the first rank, but who had
a number of relations, a spirit, warm to a degree
of fanaticism, against the republick, and the most
steady and undaunted resolution. To these was
joined, Signor Domenico Raffalli, a worthy and
learned ecclesiastick, as a sort of president of
justice, whose wisdom might preserve order in their
administration, and whose religion might temper
the violence of their measures, by principles of
conscience.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="121"/>
The Genoese at first endeavoured to overcome
the Corsicans by the sole force of the republick;
but finding themselves altogether unable for it,
while the Corsicans were every day growing
stronger, cutting to pieces the poor reinforce∣ments
of Genoese troops, and thereby supplying
themselves with more arms; the republick was
under the necessity of seeking foreign assistance.</P>
<P>They applied to the emperour, Charles the
sixth, who sent to Corsica, a body of auxiliaries,
under the command of general Wachtendonck.
These harrassed the island, without being power∣ful
enough to overawe it. They had continual
rencounters with the Corsicans, who, in one
action, killed 1200 of them. The emperour
then sent a strong army of Germans, with the
prince of Wirtemberg at their head. The Cor∣sicans
were not in condition to resist such a force.
They laid down their arms, upon condition
that a treaty should be made between them and
the Genoese, having for guarantee the em∣perour.</P>
<P>To this the republick having acceded, the
Corsicans consented that their three chiefs, toge∣ther
with Signor Aitelli, a pievano of great in∣fluence,
should go to Genoa as hostages.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"/>
These were accordingly conducted thither,
dreading no violation of the promise of safety
which had been made to them. The Ligurians
however, inclined to put them to death; and
their minister at Vienna, had almost obtained the
emperour's consent; but the prince of Wirtem∣berg,
who was afterwards killed at the battle of
Guastalla, a prince of a brave and gallant spirit,
sent an express to the emperour, with a very
strong letter, representing how much the honour
of Caesar would suffer, should he consent to the
death of those who had surrendered themselves
upon the faith of his sacred protection. This was
seconded by the generous interposition of the
great prince Eugene of Savoy; and instructions
were sent to Genoa, that the hostages should be
released.</P>
<P>Giafferi and Aitelli went home to Corsica.
Ceccaldi went to Spain, where he died with the
rank of colonel; and Raffalli went to Rome,
where he remained till he became very old. He
then returned to end his days in his native coun∣try,
where he still lives, regarded with venera∣tion.</P>
<P>The treaty which had been formally concluded
between the Corsicans and the Genoese, having
been broken by the latter, there was a very short
<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
suspension of hostilities; and in 1734, the Cor∣sicans
rose anew.</P>
<P>Giafferi was again elected a general, and got
for his collegue Signor Giacinto Paoli, father of
the present General.</P>
<P>Giacinto Paoli, was a Corsican gentleman of
a good family. But his merit distinguished him
more than his rank. He was a man of learning,
religion and bravery; well qualified to serve his
country, either in politicks, or in war. These
chiefs were assisted by a variety of presidents of
justice, elected one after another.</P>
<P>The Genoese had paid very dear for their
victory, in their struggles. It was computed,
that it had cost them above thirty millions of
livres, besides costly presents to the prince of
Wirtemberg, and to the other general officers.</P>
<P>The Marquis d'Argens very pleasantly applies
to the Genoese, the French fable of a gardener,
who complained to a gentleman in the neigh∣bourhood,
that a hare came every day into his
garden, and eat his cabbages; and begged the
gentleman would be so good, as drive her out
for him. The Gentleman comes with a pack of
hounds, and half-a-dozen huntsmen, and does
more mischief in five minutes, than the hare
could have done in seven years. After a prodi∣gious
<PB N="126" REF="124"/>
chace, the hare made her escape through
a hole in the wall. Upon which the gentleman
congratulated the gardener on getting rid of his
enemy, and advised him to stop up the hole<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lettres Juiv. lett. 34.</NOTE>.
So the Genoese, after having expended a great
deal more upon foreign auxiliaries, than any
advantage they can ever derive from Corsica;
upon the departure of these auxiliaries, have
the mortification to find themselves just as they
were.</P>
<P>Genoa again tried her force against Corsica;
but she only shewed her weakness, and bad po∣liticks.
So much fallen was she from that ad∣venturous
state, which had formerly extended
her influence so far. Genoa indeed, was unhap∣pily
administered. They relate, that the city of
Savona having rebelled several times, it was de∣liberated
in the senate, whether they ought not
to destroy it altogether. When a witty senator
of the Doria family, rose, and said, “If that
be your intention, gentlemen, you need only
send them such another governour, as the two
last were; you cannot fall on a better expe∣dient.”</P>
<P>The Corsicans on this occasion, displayed their
resolution afresh, in the cause of liberty. They
<PB N="127" REF="125"/>
were well conducted, and had many successful
engagements with the Genoese.</P>
<P>Their noble enthusiasm always continued, and,
notwithstanding many unlucky divisions among
themselves, there were still, in different parts of
the island, intrepid bands, animated by the ex∣ample
of distinguished leaders.</P>
<P>I must here take notice of count Domenico
Rivarola. His family was a branch of the house
of Rossi, at Parma, one of the most ancient
and conspicuous of the Italian nobility. His an∣cestor
had left his fief of Rivarola, in the ter∣ritory
of Mantua, on account of the wars be∣tween
the emperour, and the countess Matilda,
and had settled in the Genoese state, where he
quitted the name of Rossi, and took that of Ri∣varola.
This family of Rivalora, greatly in∣creased.
In the fifteenth century, Francis Riva∣rola
was, on account of long services, raised
to the dignity of a count Palatine, by the empe∣rour
Maximilian; from which period, the title
has since been in the family. Several descendants
of Rivarola were established in Spain, Sicily,
and the dominions of Sardinia, and three were
established in Corsica, one in Calvi, one in
Ajaccio, and one in Bastia; of which last,
<PB N="128" REF="126"/>
count Domenico Rivarola was the representa∣tive.</P>
<P>This gentleman had the lands of Chiaveri,
on the river of Genoa; was considered as a friend
of the republick, and was intrusted by her, with
the office of commissary in Balagna; a singular
honour for a Corsican.</P>
<P>He endeavoured, at this time, to make a rea∣sonable
accommodation between the Corsicans
and Genoese, which having proved ineffectual,
he was convinced, that the republick was de∣termined
to persevere in tyranny; he therefore
embraced the patriotick party, and was ever
after, most firm and zealous, in the great cause
of liberty. He quitted the island, and went over
to Leghorn, that he might be at full liberty
to negotiate upon the continent, in behalf of his
country.</P>
<P>The Genoese immediately confiscated his lands
of Chiaveri. He had still the lands of Oletta,
in Corsica; to which, he made his family re∣move
from Bastia. But, he had soon a very se∣vere
trial of his constancy. For, the same
year, his son Antonio, who was studying at the
academy of Siena, went home, to bring with
him his brother Nicholas; and, as they were
crossing over to Leghorn, in a little Tuscan
<PB N="129" REF="127"/>
vessel, with a British passport, they were taken
by the republick, and carried to Genoa, where
they were thrown into prison.</P>
<P>The republick thought this would certainly
prevent count Domenico, the father, from con∣tinuing
with the patriots. They offered to re∣store
him his possessions, to release his sons, and
to make him general of the Corsican troops in
their service, if he would return to their side.
But he answered with resolution and magnani∣mity:
“I miei figliuoli me li daranno a lor dis∣petto;
e tutte le altre offerte le stimo un nul∣la
a paragone del giusto impegno che ho pre∣so
e che seguiterò fin che ho vita. My sons
they shall be obliged to give me, whether they
will or no; and all their other offers I consider
as nothing, in comparison of the just enterprise
in which I am engaged, and in which I will
persevere while I have life.” Such instances of
patriotick spirit deserve to be recorded. The
annals of Corsica will furnish many of them.</P>
<P>When the Austrian troops entered Genoa,
the young counts Rivarola were set at liberty.
Count Antonio, the eledest, my very good
friend, is a major, in the service of the king of
Sardinia, and consul general for that sovereign in
Tuscany. Count Nicholas, the other, lives at
<PB N="130" REF="128"/>
Oletta in Corsica, but is of so delicate a consti∣tution,
that he cannot serve his country as he
would wish to do. Both the brothers have the
spirit of their father.</P>
<P>Count Domenico Rivarola obtained a regi∣ment
in the Sardinian service, and by his influ∣ence
at Turin, procured such assistance, that he
would have been able to free his country, had
it not been for the house of Matra in Corsica,
which stood by the republick, and had interest
enough to make a strong party in the island.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Corsican war went on
with spirit. Sometimes it was expected, that
the king of Spain would strike in on one side
or other. But that prince did not choose to in∣terfere.
Probably he foresaw, that it would in∣volve
him in a quarrel with France.</P>
<P>While the Genoese and the Corsicans were
thus keenly engaged, and the politicians of Eu∣rope
were forming various conjectures, a most
extraordinary circumstance occurred, to the a∣mazement
of every body. This was the appear∣ance
of Theodore, whose singular story has made
so much noise.</P>
<P>As many inconsistent reports have been cir∣culated,
with regard to this man, I have been
at great pains to obtain authentick accounts con∣cerning
<PB N="131" REF="129"/>
him, which, I am persuaded, will be very
acceptable to my readers.</P>
<P>Theodore Baron Newhoff, in the county of
La Marc in Westphalia, was the personage who
aspired to the sovereignty of Corsica. He had
his education in the French service. He after∣wards
went to Spain, where he received some
marks of regard from the duke of Riperda and
cardinal Alberoni. But being of a strange unset∣tled
projecting disposition, he quitted Spain, and
went and travelled into Italy, England and Hol∣land;
ever in search of some new adventure. He
at last fixed his attention on Corsica, and formed
a scheme of making himself a king.</P>
<P>He was a man of abilities and address; and,
after having fully informed himself of every thing
relating to the island, he went to Tunis, where he
fell upon means to procure some money and arms;
and then came to Leghorn, from whence he
wrote a letter to the Corsican chiefs, Giafferi and
Paoli, offering considerable assistance to the nati∣on,
if they would elect him as their sovereign.</P>
<P>This letter was consigned to count Domenico
Rivarola, who acted as Corsican plenipotentiary,
in Tuscany; and he gave for answer, that if Theo∣dore
brought the assistance he promised to the
<PB N="132" REF="130"/>
Corsicans, they would very willingly make him
king.</P>
<P>Upon this he, without loss of time, set sail and
landed at Tavagna in spring, 1736. He was a
man of a very stately appearance; and the Tur∣kish
dress which he wore, added to the dignity
of his mien. He had a few attendants with him.
His manners were so engaging, and his offers so
plausible, that he was proclaimed king of Corsica,
before count Rivarola's dispatches arrived to in∣form
the chiefs of the terms upon which he had
agreed. He brought with him about a thousand
zechins of Tunis, besides some arms and ammu∣nition,
and made magnificent promises of foreign
assistance; so that the Corsicans, who were glad
of any support, willingly gave into his schemes;
and it must be considered, that there could be no
great harm in allowing a man the name of king,
since they had always the power of restraining his
authority.</P>
<P>Theodore assumed every mark of royal dig∣nity.
He had his guards, and his officers of state.
He conferred titles of honour, and he struck mo∣ney,
both of silver and copper. The silver pieces
were few in number, and can now hardly be
met with. I have one of his copper coins, on one
side of it is “T. R. (Theodorus Rex) King Theo∣dore,”
<PB N="133" REF="131"/>
with a double branch crossed, and round it
this inscription, “Pro bono publico Re. Co. (Reg∣ni
Corsicae) For the public good of the kingdom
of Corsica.” On the other side, is the value of
the piece, “cinque soldi, five sous.” There was such
a curiosity over all Europe to have king Theo∣dore's
coins, that his silver pieces were sold at four
zechins each; and when the genuine ones were
exhausted, imitations of them were made at Na∣ples,
and, like the imitations of antiques, were
bought up at a high price, and carefully preserved
in the cabinets of the virtuosi.</P>
<P>Theodore immediately blocked up the Ge∣noese
fortified towns; and he used to be some∣times
at one siege, sometimes at another, standing
with a telescope in his hand, as if he spied the
assistance which he said he expected. He used
also the artifice of making large packets be con∣tinually
brought to him from the continent, which
he gave out to be from the different sovereigns of
Europe, acknowledging his authority, and promis∣ing
to befriend him.</P>
<P>The Genoese were not a little confounded
with this unexpected adventurer. They published
a violent manifesto against Theodore, treating him
with great contempt, but at the same time shew∣ing,
that they were alarmed at his appearance.
Theodore replied, in a manifesto, with all the
<PB N="134" REF="132"/>
calmness and dignity of a monarch, expressed his
indifference as to the injurious treatment of the
republick, and appeared firm in the hopes of vic∣tory.</P>
<P>The Genoese minister at London, made strong
interest against the Corsicans; and on the 24th of
July, 1736, her majesty, the queen regent of
Great Britain, issued out her royal proclamation,
prohibiting any of his majesty's subjects from fur∣nishing
provisions or assistance to the malecontents
of Corsica.</P>
<P>After having been about eight months in Cor∣sica,
Theodore perceived, that the people began
to cool in their affections towards him, and did
not act with the same resolution as before. He
therefore wisely determined, to leave them for a
little, and try his fortune again upon the continent.
So, after having laid down a plan of administra∣tion,
to be observed in his absence, he quitted the
island, in the month of November.</P>
<P>He went to Holland, and there he was suc∣cessful
enough to get credit to a great extent,
from several rich merchants, particularly Jews,
who trusted him with cannon, and other warlike
stores, to a great value, under the charge of a su∣percargo.
With these, he returned to Corsica, in
1739; and, on his arrival, he put to death his
<PB N="135" REF="133"/>
supercargo, that he might not have any trouble
from demands being made upon him.</P>
<P>By this time, as shall be afterwards shewn, the
French had become so powerful in the island,
that, although Theodore threw in his supply of
warlke stores, he did not incline to venture his
person, the Genoese having set a high price upon
his head.</P>
<P>He therefore chose to relinquish his throne,
and give up his views of ambition for fafety, hav∣ing
furnished a remarkable example, how far a
daring and desperate spirit may go. Had Theo∣dore
had a little more prudence, and some better
fortune, he, and his posterity, might have worn the
crown of Corsica, upon the generous title of hav∣ing
delivered the island from oppression.</P>
<P>It has often been said, that Theodore was se∣cretly
supported by some of the European pow∣ers.
But, from all that I can learn, there is no
foundation whatever, for this conjecture. It is,
indeed, a rare thing, to find a private gentleman
embarking on his own bottom, in an enterprise
of such a nature. But the truth is, Theodore was
a most singular man, and had been so beaten a∣bout,
by change of fortune, that he had lost the
common sentiments of mankind, and viewed things
as one who is mad, or drunk, or in a fever. He
had nothing to lose, and a great deal to win. His
<PB N="136" REF="134"/>
scheme was, to amuse the Corsicans with hopes
of foreign aid; and, by the force of hope, to car∣ry
them foreward. This might have succeeded,
in which case, he could very easily have said, that
the foreign aid would have come, had there been
occasion for it; but they had behaved with such
spirit, as to require no help. And, had he been
fortunate, it is probable, some of the powers of
Europe might have, in reality, stood by him.</P>
<P>The Corsicans now, talk differently of king
Theodore. Some of them, who had most faith in
his fine speeches, still extoll him to the skies, to
support their own judgement; others, who looked
upon him as an impostour, and never joined hear∣tily
in his measures, represent him as a kind of
Wat Tyler, a king of a rabble; but the most know∣ing
and judicious, and the General himself, consi∣der
him in the moderate light in which he has
now been represented, and own, that he was of
great service in reviving the spirit of the nation,
which, after a good many years of constant war,
was beginning to droop, but which, Theodore
restored, while he rekindled the sacred fire of li∣berty.</P>
<P>They, indeed, are sensible, that his wretched
fate has thrown a sort of ridicule on the nation,
since their king was confined in a jail at London,
which was actually the case of poor Theodore;
<PB N="137" REF="135"/>
who, after experiencing the most extraordinary
vicissitudes of fortune, chose to end his days in
our island of liberty; but was reduced to the
wretched state of a prisoner, for debt.</P>
<P>Mr. Horace Walpole generously exerted him∣self
for Theodore. He wrote a paper in the
World, with greate elegance and humour, soliciting
a contribution for the monarch in distress, to be
paid to Mr. Robert Dodsley, bookseller, as lord
high treasurer. This brought him a very hand∣some
sum. He was allowed to get out of prison.
Mr. Walpole has the original deed, by which
Theodore made over the kingdome of Corsica, in
security to his creditors. He has also the great
seal of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole has told me, that he had the
curiosity to see king Theodore, and was accord∣ingly
in company with him, at a lady's of his
acquaintance. But whether from dulness, or from
pride, he did not open his mouth.</P>
<P>I suppose he has been so much dejected, and
so much hurt by his misfortunes, that he was
become sullen and indifferent. He died very soon
after he got out of prison, and was buried in St.
Anne's church-yard, Westminster; where a simple,
unadorned monument in erected to him, with the
following inscription:</P>
<LG>
<PB N="138" REF="136"/>
<L>Near this place, is interred</L>
<L>Theodore, king of Corsica;</L>
<L>Who died in this parish, Dec. 11,
1756,</L>
<L>Immediately after leaving</L>
<L>The king's bench prison,</L>
<L>By the benefit of the act of insolvency:</L>
<L>In consequence of which,</L>
<L>He registered his kingdom of Corsica</L>
<L>For the use of his creditors.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The grave, great teacher, to a level brings,</L>
<L>Heroes, and beggars, galley-slaves, and kings;</L>
<L>But Theodore, this moral learn'd, e'er dead;</L>
<L>Fate pour'd its lesson on his living head,</L>
<L>Bestow'd a kingdom, and deny'd him bread.</L>
</LG>
<P>To return to the affairs of the island. The
Genoese, eager to repress the rise in 1734, hir∣ed
some Swiss and Grisons, who from being
accustomed to such a country at home, might
scour the mountains of Corsica. But these sol∣diers
found it no easy matter to scour moun∣tains,
where the natives were continually firing
upon them, and had numberless ways of escap∣ing.
They soon saw that they had made a bad
bargain, and that they gave the Genoese too
much blood for their money.</P>
<P>Genoa had also recourse to the desperate expe∣dient
of Marius and Sylla. She published an
<PB N="139" REF="137"/>
indemnity to all her assassins, and outlaws of
every sort, on condition that they should fight
for the republick, in Corsica. The robbers and
assassins of Genoa, are no inconsiderable propor∣tion
of her people. These wretches flocked
together, from all quarters, and were formed into
twelve companies, who were joined with the Swiss
and Grisons.</P>
<P>It may well be believed, that venal stipen∣diaries,
and abandoned criminals, could not op∣pose
an army of brave men, who were fighting in
the great cause of liberty, and had every thing
that was dear to them, at stake.</P>
<P>But France, who has ever had an eye to this
island, now began to be apprehensive that the
Corsicans might entirely throw off the yoke of
Genoa, in which case, they would either become
a free state, which the powers of Europe would,
from a mutual jealousy, protect, or perhaps, would
put themselves under the sovereignty of some great
nation. She resolved then to force them back
under the dominion of Genoa; for, by constant
negotiations with that republick, France has such
an ascendancy, that she may command, when she
pleases, whatever belongs to it.</P>
<P>A treaty was therefore made at Versailles, by
which, his most Christian Majesty engaged to re∣duce
<PB N="140" REF="138"/>
the Corsicans to obedience; and it was con∣trived
with such address, as to appear done at the
earnest desire of Genoa; though in reality, the
republick had too recently experienced the danger
of calling in the aid of a great state, to wish for a
repetition of the same expedient.</P>
<P>In the month of March, 1738, the count de
Boisseux was sent with a detachment of French
troops of Corsica. This general was a good offi∣cer,
but of no great enterprise. He was attended
on this expedition, by M. de Contades, since,
mareschal of France, who commanded the French
army, at the battle of Minden. After several con∣ferences
with the chiefs of the Corsicans, Giafferi
and Paoli, with whom we may also mention Lu∣ca
di Omano, a collateral branch of the great
family, which Sampiero di Bastelica formerly re∣presented,
M. de Boisseux finding that the Corsi∣cans
would not submit to their old oppressours,
began his hostilities.</P>
<P>The people of Corsica remonstrated to his
most Christian Majesty in a very affecting memo∣rial,
in which they enumerated at great length
their grievances, and as France had formerly af∣forded
them protection, they hoped she would
not now compel them to yield to the worst of
tyranny. To the memorial were subjoined articles
<PB N="141" REF="139"/>
of accomodation, which they submitted to the
French king.</P>
<P>These articles were thought too bold for a
people in the situation of the Corsicans; and ar∣ticles
formed by the Genoese were approved by
France: so that no accommodation could be
brought about. Giafferi and Paoli published a spi∣rited
manifesto to their countrymen, concluding
it with the noble sentiment of Judas Maccabeus:
“Melius est mori in bello quam videre mala gen∣tis
nostrae<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Maccabees, chap. iii. ver. 59.</NOTE>. It is better for us to die in bat∣tle,
than to behold the calamities of our people.”</P>
<P>M. de Boisseux did considerable hurt to the
Corsicans; for, although his operations were slow,
they were well conducted. He had even recourse
to art; for he had a part of his troops drest exact∣ly
like the people of the country, and, by that
device, they destroyed multitudes, and occasioned
a strange confusion and dismay among the Corsi∣cans,
in so much, that till they came very near
parties, who appeared upon the mountains and in
the woods, they could not be certain whether
they were friends or enemies. Meanwhile, more
troops being sent from France, the transports
were overtaken with a terrible storm, and some
of them wrecked on the Corsican coasts, where
<PB N="142" REF="140"/>
the patriots took the soldiers prisoners, and seized
their arms. M. de Boisseux did not live to see the
success of his operations. He was taken ill, and
died at Bastia, in February 1739.</P>
<P>The Genoese, much elated with the success
that the monarchy of France had against the
Corsicans, published a long memorial. The be∣ginning
of it, is truly pleasant: “All the world
knows so well, the mildness and love, with
which the republick of Genoa governs her
people; and above all, with what goodness and
affection she hath ever regarded those of Corsi∣ca,
&amp;c.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jaussin, tom. i. p. 358.</NOTE>.” They really intended this should
pass in Europe, as a serious truth.</P>
<P>Still supported by the goodness of their cause,
the Corsicans remained inflexible, nor would they
ever have given way, but to such a superiourity of
force, as it was impossible for them to withstand.</P>
<P>In March, 1739, the French sent to Corsica,
the marquis de Maillebois, a commander eve∣ry
way fitted for such an expedition, being an
officer of great penetration, and uncommon fire.
He saw, that the Corsicans had long been trifled
with by Genoa, and that even the French had
not acted against them with sufficient vigour. He
saw, that it was necessary to strike a bold stroke,
<PB N="143" REF="141"/>
if he wanted to make any impression on the va∣liant
islanders, so long accustomed to scenes of
blood; and since his sovereign had committed to
him the charge of conquering this people, he re∣solved
to do it effectually.</P>
<P>Every thing therefore, was provided for the
enterprise. He had 16 battalions of the best
troops of France, besides some arquebusiers, and
Bearnois, expert in climbing the mountains.</P>
<P>Having formed two great corps, and several
small parties, all compleatly furnished with am∣munition,
and whatever else was necessary, or
convenient; he pierced into the innermost parts
of the country, while his grenadiers carried hea∣vy
cannon across the rudest passes. He cut down
the standing corn, the vines, the olives, set fire
to the villages, and spread terrour and desolation
in every quarter. He hanged numbers of monks,
and others, who were keenest in the revolt, and
at the same time, published, wherever he went,
his terms of capitulation, which had the best
chance to be accepted, amidst so general a de∣struction.
Notwithstanding the ungenerous
cause, in which they were displayed, one cannot
but admire the martial abilities of M. de Maille∣bois.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="142"/>
We have seen, that Theodore durst not land.
The succours which he left, were not of much
avail. Such unprecedented, and terrible slaugh∣ter,
as now took place, with the dread of still
greater vengeance, from so formidable a nation as
France, obliged the Corsicans to lay down their
arms, at the end of the campaign, 1739, which
was indeed a hot one. Of these arms, a thousand
were found to have the Genoese mark. The
republick demanded to have them restored, a cir∣cumstance
little to their honour.</P>
<P>The generals, Giafferi and Paoli, left the
island, and went to Naples; where they were
both made colonels, which character, they enjoy∣ed
till their death.</P>
<P>There were still some few enthusiastick pa∣triots,
who skulked in the wildest parts of the
island; but these were all reduced before the end
of the year 1740, as was also the young ba∣ron
Newhoff, the nephew of Theodore, who
with a small party of desperadoes, had long
escaped the utmost diligence of the French com∣mander.
He surrendered, on condition, that he
and his attendants, should be landed in safety
on the continent, which was faithfully per∣formed.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143"/>
In this manner was Corsica totally vanquish∣ed
by France, of which the Genoese were as
proud, as if it had been their own atchieve∣ment.
They gave in proposals to M. de Maille∣bois,
for keeping the island in perpetual quiet.
These proposals are preserved by M. Jaussin<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jaussin, tom. i. p. 468.</NOTE>;
and they are such, as any state should be ashamed
of. Amongst many other barbarous schemes,
one was, to transport a considerable number of
the inhabitants, and make them over to the
king of France, to people his distant colonies.
Could there be a more harsh, or a more absurd
measure, than this? Jaussin is much on the side
of Genoa, and through the whole of his two
volumes, does not seem to have felt one spark
of true liberty, or at all to have entered into the
spirit of what the Corsicans were fighting for;
yet when he recites this proposal, he cannot
help saying: “Il sembloit par là qu'ils auroient
été contens d' etre soverains des seuls rochers
de Corse sans sujets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 481.</NOTE>. It would thence ap∣pear,
that the Genoese would have been satisfied
to be sovereigns of the bare rocks of Corsica,
without subjects.”</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="144"/>
France being engaged with more important
objects than Corsica, or any thing concerning the
Genoese, was no longer at leisure to employ her
attention on that island. All Europe being now
in agitation, she thought proper to recall her
troops from Corsica. They accordingly quitted
the island, in the end of the year 1741, leaving
it in perfect submission and quietness; as was said
of the Romans by Galgacus, the ancient Scottish
chief, in his famous speech, upon the Grampian
mountains; “Ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem ap∣pellant
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de vit. Agric. cap. 30.</NOTE>. Where they make a desart, they call
it peace.”</P>
<P>The French, indeed, knew the Corsicans too
well, to believe, that they would submit to Ge∣noa,
when left to themselves. The event hap∣pened
accordingly; for the French were hardly
gone, before the Corsicans were again as much in
motion as ever. Several of their countrymen,
who were settled in different towns in Italy,
furnished them with arms; and, as they had
formerly done, they took a good many arms
from the Genoese. From having been long
depressed, like a strong bow recovering its ela∣sticity,
they rose with renewed vigour. Man,
<PB N="147" REF="145"/>
woman and child, may be said to have engaged;
for very young boys took the field; and even
some of their women, like those of Sparta, shew∣ed
their valour in battle. Many of the religious
also carried arms; and, as if actuated by a kind of
universal inspiration, every soul was ardent against
the tyrant.</P>
<P>Gaffori and Matra, now obtained the govern∣ment
of Corsica, under the title of Protectours of
the kingdom. Gaffori was a man of distinguished
talents. His eloquence was most remarkable; and
the Corsicans still talk with admiration of his ha∣rangues
to them. He heard once, that a band of
assassins were coming against him. He went out,
and met them with a serene dignity, which asto∣nished
them. He begged they would only hear
him a little; and he gave them so pathetick a pic∣ture
of the distresses of Corsica, and roused their
spirits to such a degree against those, who caused
the oppression, that the assassins threw themselves
at his feet, intreated his forgiveness, and instantly
joined his banners.</P>
<P>The Genoese being in possession of the castle
of Corte, it was besieged with great vigour by the
Corsicans, commanded by Gaffori. By a strange
want of thought, the nurse, who took care of
Gaffori's eldest son, then an infant, wandered a∣way,
<PB N="148" REF="146"/>
at a little distance from the camp. The
Genoese perceived it, and making a sudden sally,
they got hold of the nurse and the child, and
carried them into the castle. The General she w∣ed
a decent concern at this unhappy accident,
which struck a damp into the whole army. The
Genoese thought they could have Gaffori upon
their own terms, since they were possessed of so
dear a pledge. When he advanced to make
some cannon play, they held up his son, directly
over that part of the wall, against which his ar∣tillery
was levelled. The Corsicans stopt, and be∣gan
to draw back; but Gaffori, with the resoluti∣on
of a Roman, stood at their head, and ordered
them to continue the fire. Luckily, his firmness
was not broken by losing his child, who escaped
unhurt. I had the pleasure of knowing the young
gentleman, who inherits his father's estate. He
related to me himself, from the best authority,
this story, which does so much honour to his fa∣ther.
I had it also vouched, by such as had no
particular interest in it.</P>
<P>Matra, the other general or protectour, was
always suspected, as secretly favouring the views
of Genoa, and was rather a promoter of divi∣sion,
than a patron of liberty. Indeed, the great
misfortune of the Corsicans, was their want of
<PB N="149" REF="147"/>
union; which made particular animosities take
up their attention, and divert their zeal from the
great cause.</P>
<P>In 1745, Count Domenico Rivarola, arrived
at Bastia, along with some Englsh shiips of war.
Great Britain had forbidden her subjects to give
any assistance to the Corsicans; but, by the
changeful schemes of political connexions, she
consented to send some ships against the Genoese;
not, as if from herself, but, as complying with
the request of her ally, the king of Sardinia,
who had taken the cause of Corsica much to
heart. These ships bombarded Bastia, and San
Fiorenzo, both of which they delivered into the
hands of the Corsicans. The force of the Bri∣tish
men of war, and the great service done by
us to their cause, are never forgotten, by the
brave islanders.</P>
<P>Count Rivarola, was proclaimed Generalissi∣mo
of the kingdom. Gaffori and Matra, were
not present at this election, and did every thing
in their power to oppose it; so that there was no∣thing
but heart-burnings, and miserable dissen∣sions;
and the British went away with an idea of
this people, as if they had been a parcel of
half-barbarians.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="148"/>
As our information, with regard to Corsica,
has been very imperfect, these unhappy impres∣sions
have continued ever since, and have had too
much influence in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Rivarola, Gaffori, and Matra, having at length
come to a tolerable agreement, matters went on
a little better, though the Genoese soon recovered
Bastia and San Fiorenzo.</P>
<P>In 1746, the Corsicans sent two envoys, with
proposals to the Earl of Bristol, then his Britan∣nick
Majesty's ambassadour, at the court of Tu∣rin.
The intention of these proposals was, that
Corsica should put herself entirely under the pro∣tection
of Great Britain. The envoys waited at
Turin, till My Lord Bristol had a return from
the ministry at London, signifying their satisfac∣tion
at what had been communicated, hoping the
Corsicans would preserve the same obliging sen∣timents;
but that it was not then the time to
enter into any treaty with them.</P>
<P>Count Domenico Rivarola, finding that he
could be of most service to his country, when at
a distance, returned to Turin, where he con∣stantly
improved the benevolent intentions of his
Sardinian Majesty towards Corsica. He died
with the rank of colonel, in April 1748, and
<PB N="151" REF="149"/>
left behind him the character of an honest man,
and a gallant patriot.</P>
<P>In the same month and year, the British ship,
the Nassau, commanded by captain Holcomb,
together with some transports, carried over to
Corsica, two battalions, one of the king of
Sardinia's troops, and one of Austrians, in or∣der
to aid the Corsicans; but the general peace
being concluded, at Aix la Chapelle, no foreign
states could any longer interfere, and the Corsi∣cans
and Genoese, were again left to them∣selves.</P>
<P>My Lord Hailes has, among his valuable col∣lection
of historical manuscripts, two pieces re∣lating
to Corsica. The one entitled, “Informa∣tion
de l'état dans leqel se trouve presentement la
Corse, &amp; de ce qu'il faudroit pour la delivrer de
l'esclavage du gouvernement Genois, traduit de
l'Italien,” is written by Count Domenico Riva∣rola.
The other, is an account of the state of
Corsica, in the original Italian; drawn up by
one, who appears to have been well acquainted
with the subject. Both of these papers set
forth, the advantages to be derived to a maritime
power, from an alliance with Corsica. They
were communicated by M. Carret de Gorregne,
the Sardinian minister, to general Wentworth,
the British ambassadour, at the court of Turin
<PB N="152" REF="150"/>
and, I believe, they had considerable influence,
in procuring the interposition of Sardinia and
Great Britain, in favour of the Corsicans.</P>
<P>Matra, in the end of the year 1748, went to
the service of Piedmont, and left Gaffori sole ge∣neral
of the island. A repetition of the same de∣sperate
actions continued, till on the 3d of Oc∣tober,
1753, Gaffori was assassinated by a band
of murderers, set on by the republick. At least,
it is a fact that some of these wretches have still a
miserable pension to support them, in the terri∣tory
of Genoa. There is a pillar of infamy
erected at Corte, on the place, where stood the
house of the principal actour in this bloody villa∣ny.
The house was burnt, and razed from the
foundation.</P>
<P>The Corsicans, from their family connexions,
and violent parties, differ in their accounts of
Gaffori. Some of them would have it believed,
that he was too much engrossed by selfish views,
and in order to promote his own interest, endea∣voured
to bring about unworthy schemes of recon∣ciliation
with Genoa. But, besides the reluct∣ance
which every generous mind must feel, to
give credit to injurious reports of a hero, whose
greatness of soul shone forth, in the manner I
have related, what I heard of Gaffori from those,
<PB N="153" REF="151"/>
in whose judgment and impartiality I could con∣fide,
joined with the regard with which he is had
in remembrance by the majority of his country∣men,
determine me to a persuasion of the reality
of his virtues.</P>
<P>The administratours of the island had been so
well instituted by general Gaffori, that Corsica
was able to continue for two years without any
chief; while the war was still carried on with va∣rious
success.</P>
<P>The patriots did not however, swear a solemn
oath, that, rather than submit to the republick,
they would throw themselves into the fire, like
the Saguntines of old. This oath, which is con∣ceived
in terms of strength and violence, not un∣like
the Corsican stile, but somewhat exaggerated,
was circulated over Europe, and generally be∣lieved
to be genuine. Doctour Smollet, who
displays a generous warmth in favour of the Cor∣sicans,
was very naturally led to give this oath a
place in his history<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Smoll. hist. vol. XVI. p. 384.</NOTE>; but Paoli assures me,
that it was a fiction.</P>
<P>I come now, to a remarkable event in the an∣nals
of Corsica, an event, from which the hap∣piness
and glory of that island will principally be
<PB N="154" REF="152"/>
dated. I mean, the election of Pascal Paoli, to
be General of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Pascal Paoli<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His name, in Italian, is Pasquale de' Paoli. I write Pascal, as more agreeable to an English ear. I also avoid giv∣ing him any title. I owe this thought to My Lord Hailes. When I asked him, Whether I should call Paoli, Signor, or General? his answer was, “Signor is better than Gene∣ral, but plain Pascal is better than either. You do not say, King Alexander, but Alexander of Macedon; no title adds to the dignity of Judas Maccabeus.”</NOTE>, was second son to the old
chief Giacinto Paoli. He had been educated
with great care by his father, who formed his
taste for letters, and inspired him with every wor∣thy
and noble sentiment. He was born in Corsi∣ca,
where he remained long enough, to contract
a love and attachment to his country, and to feel
the oppression under which it groaned.</P>
<P>When the patriots were totally crushed by the
marquis de Maillebois, his father took young
Paoli to Naples, where he had the advantage of
attending the academy, got a commission as an
officer in that service, and was much about court.</P>
<P>Here he lived twelve or thirteen years, culti∣vating
the great powers with which nature had
endowed him, and laying the foundation of those
<PB N="155" REF="153"/>
grand designs, which he had early formed, for
the deliverance of his country.</P>
<P>His reputation became so great among the Cor∣sicans,
that he received the strongest invitations
to come over and take the command. He em∣barked
in the glorious enterprise, stimulated by
generous ambition, and undismayed by a consi∣deration
of the dangers, the cares, and the un∣certainty
which he was about to encounter.</P>
<P>There was something particularly affecting, in
his parting from his father; the old man, hoary
and gray with years, fell on his neck, and kissed
him, gave him his blessing, and with a broken
feeble voice, encouraged him in the undertaking,
on which he was entering: “My son,” said he,
“I may, possibly, never see you more; but in
my mind, I shall ever be present with you.
Your design is a great, and a noble one; and I
doubt not, but GOD will bless you in it. The
little which remains to me of life, I will allot to
your cause, in offering up my prayers and sup∣plications
to heaven, for your protection and
prosperity.” Having again embraced him, they
parted.</P>
<P>Pascal Paoli no sooner appeared in the island,
than he attracted the attention of every body.
His carriage and deportment prejudiced them in
his favour, and his superiour judgment, and pa∣triotick
<PB N="156" REF="154"/>
spirit, displayed with all the force of elo∣quence,
charmed their understandings. All this,
heightened with condescension, affability and
modesty, entirely won him their hearts. A way
was open for him to the supreme command, and
he was called to it by the unanimous voice of his
countrymen; upon which occasion, was issued
the following manifesto.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Supreme, and General Council of the King∣dom
of CORSICA, to the Beloved people of that
NATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BELOVED PEOPLE AND COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THE discords and divisions, that have begun
to infect the publick, as well as private tranquil∣lity
of our country, by the revival of ancient,
and personal enmities amongst those, who have
very little fear of GOD, and are little interested
and zealous, for the good of the publick, have
obliged our principal chiefs to call us together,
to this general Consulta, in order to deliberate
on such necessary measures, as may effectually
contribute to the establishment of a common
union, and to cause the most rigid laws to be
put in execution, against such as shall dare to
<PB N="157" REF="155"/>
disturb it by their private piques, or unruly dis∣positions.”</P>
<P>The most proper and effectual means, to suc∣ceed
in this our desirable end,“ are by us seri∣ously
thought to be, the electing of one oeco∣nomical,
political and general chief, of enlight∣ened
faculties, to command over this kingdom
with full power, except when there shall be oc∣casion
to consult upon matters concerning the
state, which he cannot treat of, without the
concurrence of the people, or their respective
representatives.”</P>
<P>“By the general voice is elected for that trust,
Pascal Paoli; a man, whose virtues and abili∣ties,
render him every way worthy thereof.”</P>
<P>“After so general an election, by the chiefs of
the council of war, the deputies of the pro∣vinces,
and the respective representatives of the
parishes assembled, this gentleman was invited,
by a letter, to come; and a large committee of
the principal members of the assembly, was
sent to his house, to desire him to accept of the
charge, and to repair hither to be acknowledg∣ed
as our chief; and to take the solemn oath, to
exercise the office, with which he is invested,
with the utmost zeal, affection and disinterested∣ness;
<PB N="158" REF="156"/>
and to receive the oath of fidelity and
obedience from the commons.”</P>
<P>“Besides having given many reasons against
this, he has shewn much reluctance to take up∣on
him so great a charge; but having been in∣formed
of our resolutions and determinations, in
case of any obstacle or refusal, he was obliged
to acquiesce, being necessitated so to do. He
was conducted hither last night, and hath
plighted and received the oaths above-men∣tioned.”</P>
<P>“He is to take the government upon himself,
assisted by two counsellors of state, and one
of the most reputable persons from each pro∣vince,
who shall be changed every month.”</P>
<P>“The third day of August shall be fixed on,
for a general circuit, in order to punish the
authours of many crimes, particularly murders,
committed lately in different parts. This cir∣cuit,
to be directed by the aforesaid General,
with the deputies. The number of armed men,
as he shall think fitting.”</P>
<P>“We hope, that these our resolutions and de∣liberations,
will be to the general satisfaction,
as it concerns the common good: and we
charge all the chiefs and commissaries over
<PB N="159" REF="157"/>
the parishes, to co-operate, as far as lies in
their power, to promote the publick tranquil∣lity.”</P>
<P>Dated at St. Antonio of the White House,
this 15th of July, 1755.</P>
<P>Though Paoli had long meditated on the im∣portance
of the charge he was to enter upon, its
near approach struck him with awe; for his ideas
were enlarged, his resolves were magnanimous,
and the office appeared more momentous to
him, than it could appear to one of more con∣fined
views, and more moderate plans.</P>
<P>His hesitation and diffidence, when called to
the supreme command, was not affected. He
balanced the consequences, and he could not
but be seriously moved. For he could not di∣vine
with certainty, the astonishing influence
which his government was to have, on the hap∣piness
of his country. But the representations
made to him, were so earnest, and, in some
measure, so peremptory, that he thought him∣self
bound in duty to accept of the arduous
task.</P>
<P>When he enquired into the situation of the
affairs of Corsica, he found the utmost disorder
and confusion. There was no subordination, no
<PB N="160" REF="158"/>
discipline, no money, hardly any arms and am∣munition;
and, what was worse than all, little
union among the people. He immediately began
to remedy these defects. His persuasion and ex∣ample,
had wonderful force; all ranks exerted
themselves, in providing what was necessary for
carrying on the war with spirit; whereby, in a
short time, the Genoese were driven to the re∣motest
corners of the island.</P>
<P>Having thus expelled the foe, from the bo∣som
of his country, he had leisure to attend to
the civil part of the administration, in which he
discovered abilities and constancy hardly to be
paralleled. He rectified innumerable abuses,
which had insinuated themselves, during the late
times of trouble and confusion. He, in a man∣ner,
new-modelled the government, upon the
foundest principles of democratical rule, which
was always his favourite idea.</P>
<P>The Corsicans having been long denied legal
justice, had assumed the right of private revenge,
and had been accustomed to assassinate each other
upon the most trivial occasions. He found it ex∣tremely
difficult to break them of this practice,
by which it was computed, that the state lost
800 subjects every year. The disease was be∣come
<PB N="161" REF="159"/>
so violent, that it seemed almost incurable.
However, by seasonable admonition, by repre∣senting
to them the ruin of this practice to the
cause of liberty, at a time when they had occa∣sion
for all the assistance they could lend to each
other, joined to a strict exercise of criminal jus∣tice;
he gradually brought them to be convin∣ced,
that the power of dispensing punishment be∣longed
to the publick; and that, without a pro∣per
submission, and a regular system of admini∣stration,
they never could make head against an
enemy, or, indeed, be properly speaking, a state.
So effectual were the measures he took, that a
law was passed, making assassination capital, let
it be committed on any pretence whatever.</P>
<P>The Corsicans are naturally humane; but,
like the Italians, and most southern nations, are
extremely violent in their trempers. This is cer∣tainly
the effect of a warm climate, which forms
the human frame to an exquisite degree of sensibi∣lity.
Whatever advantages this sensibility may
produce, by cherishing the finer feelings and
more exalted affections; it is at the same time
productive of some disadvantages, being equally
the occasion of impatience, sudden passion, and a
spirit of revenge, tending to the disorder of
society.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="160"/>
Paoli, by his masterly knowledge of human
nature, guided the Corsicans to glory, and ren∣dered
the impetuosity of their dispositions, and
their passion for revenge, subservient to the noble
objects of liberty, and of vindicating their coun∣try.
His wise institutions had so good an effect,
that notwithstanding of their frequent losses in
action, it was found, that in a few years; the
number of inhabitants was increased 16000.</P>
<P>When a proper system of government was
formed, and some of the most glaring abuses rec∣tified,
Paoli proceeded to improve and civilize the
manners of the Corsicans. This was a very de∣licate
task. They had been brought up in anar∣chy,
and their constant virtue had been resistance.
It therefore, required the nicest conduct, to make
them discern the difference between salutary re∣straint
and tyrannick oppression. He was no mo∣narch,
born to rule, and who received a nation
as a patrimonial inheritance. It was, therefore,
in vain to think of acting with force, like the
Czar Peter towards the Russians. It was not, in∣deed,
consistent with his views of forming a free
nation; but, had he been inclined to it, he could
not have executed such a plan. He was entirely
dependant upon the people, elected by them,
and answerable to them for his conduct. It was no
easy matter to restrain those of whom he held
his power. But this, Paoli accomplished.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="161"/>
He gradually prepared the Corsicans for the
reception of laws, by cultivating their minds, and
leading them, of their own accord, to desire the
enactment of regulations, of which he shewed
them the benefit. He established an university at
Corte; and he was at great pains to have proper
schools, for the instruction of children, in every
village of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The last step he took was, to induce the Cor∣sicans
to apply themselves to agriculture, com∣merce,
and other civil occupations. War had
entirely ruined industry in the island. It had given
the Corsicans a contempt for the arts of peace;
so that they thought nothing worthy of their at∣tention,
but arms and military achievements.
The great and valourous actions, which many of
them had performed, gave them a certain pride,
which disdained all meaner and more inglorious
occupation. Heroes could not submit to sink
down into plain peasants. Their virtue was not
so perfect, as that of the ancient Romans, who
could return from the triumphs of victory, to
follow their ploughs.</P>
<P>From these causes, the country was a danger
of being entirely uncultivated, and the people of
becoming of a lawless and ungovernable rabble of
banditti.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="162"/>
Paoli therefore, set himself seriously to guard
against this; and by degrees, brought the Cor∣sicans
to look upon labour with less aversion, so
as at least to provide themselves sufficiently in
food and clothing, and to carry on a little com∣merce.</P>
<P>His administration, in every respect was such,
that, from being rent into factions, the nation
became firm and united; and had not France
again interposed, the Corsican heroes would long
before this time have totally driven the Genoese
from the island.</P>
<P>Feeling its own importance, the Corsican na∣tion
resolved to give the Genoese no quarter at sea,
which they had hitherto done, out of indulgence
to the individuals of the republick; lamenting
their unhappy situation, which obliged them to
live under a tyrannical government. But finding
that the Genoese continually attacked, and made
booty of the Corsican vessels, it was thought
highly equitable to retaliate; preserving at the
same time, all due respect for the other maritime
powers. To this effect, a manifesto was issued
in 1760<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These firm and rapid advances of the Corsi∣can
nation, filled the Genoese with serious con∣cern;
and in 1761, they published a manifesto
in very mild and insinuating terms, to try i
<PB N="165" REF="163"/>
they could allure the Corsicans to a pacifick sub∣mission
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Immediately upon this, a general council
was assembled at Vescovato in Casinca, where
the strongest resolutions were taken, never to
make any agreement with the republick, but on
condition of having Corsica secured in its liber∣ties
and independency<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A memorial was also published by the Cor∣sicans,
to the sovereigns of Europe<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>. IV.</NOTE>, calling
upon them, by the rights of humanity, to in∣terpose,
and give peace to a nation which had
done so much for freedom.</P>
<P>In these various writings, there is a spirit of
eloquence, a feeling, and a resolution, which
does honour to the character of this people.</P>
<P>But the politicks of Versailles did not favour
the Corsican cause; France has been alternately,
the scourage and the shield of Genoa. Paoli had
well nigh compleatly finished his great scheme of
freeing every part of the island from the Genoese,
when a treaty was concluded between France and
the republick, by which the former engaged to
send six battalions of troops to garrison the forti∣fied
towns in Corsica, for the space of four years.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="164"/>
When this treaty was first known in Europe,
every noble heart was afflicted; for every body
believed, that France was again determined to
carry fire and sword into Corsica, and blast the
hopes of the brave islanders. M. Rousseau wrote
of it, with his usual energy, to his friend and
mine, M. De Leyre, at Parma; one of the au∣thours
of the Encyclopedie, a man who unites
with science and genius the most amiable heart and
most generous soul: “Il faut avouer que vos
François, sont un peuple bien servile, bien ven∣du
à la tyrannie, bien cruel, et bien acharé sur
les malheureux. S'ils savoient un homme libre
à l'autre bout du monde, je crois qu'ils iroient
pour le seul plaisir de l'exterminer. It must
be owned that your countrymen, the French,
are a very servile nation, wholly sold to ty∣ranny,
exceedingly cruel and relentless in
persecuting the unhappy. If they knew of
a free man at the other end of the world, I
believe they would go thither for the mere
pleasure of extirpating him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to give a good translation of a sentence so original and forcible. I am indebted for the above, to a friend who does not choose to have his name mentioned as a translator.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="165"/>
But it turned out to be a prudent and poli∣tick
scheme on the part of France. She was
owing the Genoese some millions of livres.
Her finances were not such as made it very con∣venient
for her to pay. But the French mi∣nisters
are never at a loss to conclude an advan∣tageous
treaty for their monarch. They told
the Genoese, “We cannot yet let you have your
money. But we will send you six battalions
of auxiliaries to Corsica, and let that be a sink∣ing
fund for the discharge of our debt.” The
Genoese, who recalled with barbarous satisfac∣tion
what France had formerly done against
the Corsicans, never doubted, that if French
soldiers were again in the island, continual
skirmishes would ensue; France would be
provoked, and a bloody war would be the
consequence, by which the Corsicans would a∣gain
be reduced to a state of slavery. They were
therefore extremely pleased with the scheme.</P>
<P>The French, however, took care to engage
to act only on the defensive, and to fix the trea∣ty
for four years, that they might be sure of
having time to sink their debt. They sent the
troops as stipulated in the end of the year 1764;
<PB N="168" REF="166"/>
and the Count De Marboeuf was appointed com∣mander
in chief.</P>
<P>M. De Marboeuf was an officer of experience
and temper; and, no doubt, and his instruc∣tions
to conduct himself mildly towards the Cor∣sicans.
All his duty was, to take care that
things should not become worse for Genoa; but,
that she should still retain the garrison towns of
Bastia, San Fiorenzo, Calvi, Algagliola and
Ajaccio.</P>
<P>The Corsicans conducted themselves, upon
this occasion, with the greatest propriety. A
general council was held, and determinations
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>. V.</NOTE> published; from which it appears, that they
shewed no distrust of the French, who, they
trusted, would not begin hostilities against them.
But, for greater security, it was provided, that
a council of war should be appointed by the
government, to be ever vigilant against any in∣fractions
of what they supposed France had ta∣citly
promised to them, and was bound by the
law of nations to observe; that the French troops
should not be allowed to have access to the ter∣ritories
of the nation; that the General should
<PB N="169" REF="167"/>
post sufficient guards upon the frontiers; and
if any French officer desired a passport, he
might grant him it; but should be obliged
to give an account, in the first general con∣sulta
thereafter, of what passports he had grant∣ed;
of his motives for granting them; and
of every treaty he should have with the French.
That, as it was reported, some new propo∣sals
of peace with the republick would be of∣fered,
they should reject all such, if they did
not first grant to the nation, the preliminaries
resolved upon in the general council of Ca∣sinca.
That the General should make a res∣pectful
remonstrance, in name of the nation,
to his most Christian Majesty, with regard
to the loss it must sustain by the arrival of his
troops; by which, the Genoese would be re∣lieved
of the great expence of the Corsican
war, and the patriots be prevented from con∣tinuing
their successful enterprises, and totally
expelling their enemies from the island. That
this remonstrance might be more effectual, his
excellency should, at the same time, apply
to the powers favourable to Corsica, that they
might employ their mediation with the French
king, in order to preserve to the nation its
<PB N="170" REF="168"/>
rights, prerogatives, liberty and independen∣cy.
And they further ordered, that as every
body had, without controul, cut timber in
the woods of Corsica, they should be prohibited
so to do, without the permission of the govern∣ment.</P>
<P>These determinations were wise and mode∣rate.
Without giving umbrage to the French,
they secured the patriots from sudden attacks,
or insidious wiles. The article relating to
the cutting of timber, was essentially requi∣site
to prevent the French from carrying it
away to Marseilles and Toulon; which they,
probably, would have done, had it not been
for this edict, which preserved to the Corsi∣cans
a noble supply of wood, to be ready, either
for their own service, or for the service of any
maritime power, with whom they might make
an alliance.</P>
<P>The warlike operations of Corsica were now
suspended. But Paoli improved the season
of tranquillity to the best purpose, in pre∣paring
for future schemes of victory, and in
giving perfection and stability to the civil
constitution of his country; effectuating what
ages had not been able to produce, and ex∣hibiting
<PB N="171" REF="169"/>
an illustrious instance of what was said
of Epaminondas: “Unum hominem pluris
fuisse quam civitatem<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Corn. Nep. vit. Epam. in fin.</NOTE>. That one man
has been of more consequence than a whole
nation.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Present State of CORSICA, with respect to
Government, Religion, Arms, Commerce, Learn∣ing,
the Genius and Character of its INHABI∣TANTS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER running over the revolutions of an
island, which has experienced so many vi∣cissitudes,
it will be agreeable to consider the re∣sult
of these vigorous exertions in the cause of
liberty. I shall, therefore, with much pleasure,
present my readers with the state of Corsica as it
now is.</P>
<P>The Government of Corsica is, as follows.
Every paese or village, elects, by majority of
votes, a Podestà and other two magistrates, who
have the respectable name of “Padri del Com∣mune;
Fathers of the Community.” These ma∣gistrates
are chosen annually. They may be con∣tinued
in office for several years, at the will of
the community; but there must be a new elec∣tion
every year.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="171"/>
The Podestà, by himself, may determine
causes to the value of ten livres; and united with
the Padri del Commune, may finally determine
causes to the value of thirty livres. The Podestà
is the representative of the government, and to
him are addressed all the orders of the supreme
council. The Padri del Commune superintend
the oeconomy and police of the village, call the
people together, and consult with them on every
thing that concerns their interest. In some vil∣lages,
the inhabitants join with the Podestà and
Padri del Commune, twelve honest men, in
whom they can confide, and to whom they dele∣gate
their power of settling the affairs of the pu∣blick.
These are called counsellors, and sit as
assessors with the three magistrates of the village.
The names of these Magistrates, as soon as elect∣ed,
must be transmitted to the magistrates of the
province, who have it in their power to oppose
the choice, and order a new election; but this
never happens when the people have been unani∣mous.
Sometimes they choose two Podestàs and
one Padre del Commune, and sometimes more
and sometimes fewer counsellors. These irre∣gularities
are permitted, to humour the caprices
of different villages in an infant state, and are of
no consequence; for the same degree of power
<PB N="175" REF="172"/>
remains to each office, whether it be held by
a lesser or a greater number; as in the states of
Holland, those who send two or three represen∣tatives,
have but an equal voice with those who
send only one. In some of the more considerable
towns, the Podestà is not subject to the provin∣cial
magistrates, but is considered as having equal
authority with them.</P>
<P>Once a year, all the inhabitants of each vil∣lage
assemble themselves and choose a Procura∣tour,
to represent them in the general consulta
or parliament of the nation, which is held an∣nually
in the month of May, at the city of
Corte. This procuratour is elected by the ma∣jority
of the voices. He must have a mandate,
attested by a notary publick, which, on his ar∣rival
at Corte, he presents to the great chancel∣lor
of the kingdom, by whom it is registered.
Each procuratour has, from his community, a
livre a day, to bear his charges from the time of
his setting out till his return home. This al∣lowance
is too small, and must soon be in∣creased.</P>
<P>Sometimes the procuratours of all the villages,
contained in the same pieve, choose from among
themselves one who goes as representative of the
pieve, which saves some expence to the villages.
<PB N="176" REF="173"/>
But this is an abuse, and when matters of any
consequence are deliberating, it renders the num∣ber
of those who are to consult too small. A
little expence should be despised, in comparison
of having a voice in making the laws, and settling
the most serious affairs of the country; and the
greater the number of voices, the more does the
assembly approach to the idea of a Roman
comitia.</P>
<P>The general consulta is, indeed, a great and
numerous assembly; for, besides the ordinary
procuratours, it is usual to call in several of those
who have formerly been members of the supreme
council, and several of those who have lost their
fathers of near relations in the service of their
country, that the blood of heroes may be distin∣guished
by publick honours.</P>
<P>The magistrates of each province also send a
procuratour to the general consulta; and when
all the procuratours are assembled at Corte, in
presence of the General and the supreme council
of state, it is recommended to the procuratours of
each province, to choose two of their number,
who, together with the procuratour of their ma∣gistrates,
may proceed to the election of the pre∣sident
and oratour of the general consulta. The
procuratours of each province accordingly choose
<PB N="177" REF="174"/>
two of their number by votes viva voce, if they
are unanimous; and if not unanimous, by bal∣lot.</P>
<P>These two, with the procuratour of the ma∣gistrates
of each province, come before the su∣preme
council, to whom every one of them gives
in a sealed note, containing the name of the person
who, he thinks, should be president: these notes
are considered by the supreme council, and the
three who have most notes inscribed with their
names, are put to a ballot; and he who carries
two thirds of the votes in his favour, is made
president.</P>
<P>In the schedule or note, a procuratour may in∣sert
the name of his relation, or of one who has
been strongly recommended to him; but by bal∣lot,
he can freely give his vote for the person
whom he thinks most deserving; so that it often
happens, that the person among the three, who
had the fewest notes for him, will be made pre∣sident
by a great majority. This appears to me
another abuse; for a procuratour, by inserting
in the schedule the name of one of whom he
does not approve, runs a risk of having the man
whom he thinks most deserving, thrown out al∣together.
Besides, he ought not to be moved by
considerations of connection or of recommenda∣tion.
<PB N="178" REF="175"/>
The members of the supreme council
have also their votes in this ballot for the presi∣dent.
The oratour is chosen exactly in the same
manner.</P>
<P>The president governs during the sitting of the
general consulta. The oratour reads the different
papers subjected to deliberation. Propositions
from the government are addressed to the presi∣dent.
Those from the people are addressed to
the oratour. If a proposition from the govern∣ment
is approved of by a majority of voices, it is
immediately passed into a law. But a proposition
from the people, though approved of, may be
suspended by the government, without assigning
their reasons; which, however, they are strictly
obliged to do at the next general consulta.</P>
<P>This suspending power was greatly agitated in
the Corsican parliament; and the people opposed
it so much, that it was thought it would not
take place. But Paoli, ever ready to enlighten
his countrymen, shewed them, that in the present
state of affairs, the government may have many
designs, not mature enough for being commu∣nicated
to the publick, but of essential advan∣tage
to the nation; so that it is highly proper they
should have the privilege of delaying for a while,
any proposition which might interfere with these
<PB N="179" REF="176"/>
designs. Besides, the supreme council, as the
grand procuratours of the nation, and possessed
of their greatest confidence, ought to be speci∣ally
heard; and if they think a proposition im∣portant
and critical, may well be allowed to put
it off, till it shall be fully considered by all the
subjects of the state. And this can be attended
with no bad consequences; since the people may,
at an after period, pass their proposition into a
law.</P>
<P>The procuratours of each province next as∣semble
themselves, in presence of the president
of the general consulta, or a president deputed
by him; and each province appoints its repre∣sentative
in the supreme council, for the ensuing
year; and one of these is elected into the office
of Great Chancellor. The supreme council, for
the time being, may remonstrate against this
election; and the election of each province must
be confirmed by a majority of the other provin∣ces;
because these counsellors, with the General
of the kingdom, are to form the executive pow∣er
of the whole nation; the general consulta or
legislative power devolving upon them that high
commission.</P>
<P>The General holds his office for life. He is
perpetual president of the supreme council of nine.
<PB N="180" REF="177"/>
He votes in all questions; and in case of an equa∣lity,
he has a casting vote. He is absolute com∣mander
of the troops or militia of the island.
His office much resembles that of the Stadtholder
of Holland.</P>
<P>The procuratours of each province also choose
the provincial magistrates for the ensuing year.
This magistracy is regularly composed of a presi∣dent,
two consultors, an auditour and a chancel∣lor:
but the number is varied in different pro∣vinces,
in the same manner as the magistracy in
different villages. The auditour and chancel∣lor
have small salaries; and the magistracy have
their table kept at the publick expence, with a
guard of soldiers in pay. The provincial ma∣gistrates
can try criminals, and pronounce sen∣tence
against them; but a sentence for capital
punishment cannot be put in execution, till it is
approved by the supreme council. In civil cau∣ses,
they can determine finally to the extent of
fifty livres; in causes exceeding that sum, parties
may appeal to the Rota Civile, which is a tri∣bunal
consisting of three doctours of laws, cho∣sen
by the supreme council, and continued at
their pleasure. This tribunal judges according
to the civil and canon laws, and according
to the particular laws of Corsica. These last
were partly formed in old times, and afterwards
<PB N="181" REF="178"/>
augmented and improved by the Genoese, who
published them under the title of, “Statuti Civili
et Criminali del Isola di Corsica.” They are be∣come
very scarce. I have a copy of them, a thin
folio, printed at Bastia, in 1694. It is a very
good little code, and does credit to Genoa. “Fe∣lix
si sic omnia. Happy would it have been
had she shewn the same equity in all respects.”
There are also a few modern laws. Although
the judgment, both of the magistrates of the
villages, and of the provincial magistrates, be
final to the extent of the values I have mentioned,
yet if any person is manifestly aggrieved, he may
obtain redress by applying to the supreme coun∣cil,
or to the court of syndicato, another excel∣lent
institution, which is conducted in the fol∣lowing
manner.</P>
<P>In the general consulta, besides the elections
of which I have given an account, the procura∣tours
also choose some persons of high credit and
respect, as syndicatori. These make a tour
through the different provinces, as our judges
in Britain go the circuits. They hear complaints
against the different magistrates; and if any of
them have transgressed their duty, they are pro∣perly
censured. These syndicators are exceed∣ingly
beneficial. The General himself is for the
most part one of them. They save poor people the
<PB N="182" REF="179"/>
trouble and expence of going to Corte to lay
their grievances before the supreme council.
They examine into every thing concerning the
provinces, reconcile the people to the wholesome
severity of law, encourage industry and every
good undertaking, and diffuse a spirit of order
and civilization in all corners of the island.</P>
<P>Such is the government of Corsica; which ex∣hibits
a compleat and well ordered democracy.
From the Podestà and Padri del Commune, up
to the supreme council, there is a gradual pro∣gression
of power, flowing from the people, which
they can resume, and dispose of at their pleasure,
at the end of every year; so that no magistrate
or servant of the publick, of whatever degree,
will venture, for so short a time, to encroach
upon his constituents; knowing that he must
soon give an account of his administration; and
if he should augment the authority of his office,
he is only wreathing a yoke for his own neck, as
he is immediately to return to the situation of an
ordinary subject. Nay, if a magistrate is not to∣tally
lost to every manly feeling, he will not even
allow himself to rest in supine negligence; but
will exert his powers for the good of the country,
that he may recommend himself to his fellow ci∣tizens,
and be honoured with farther marks of
their confidence.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="180"/>
In the general consulta held in the year 1764,
several wise regulations were made with regard to
the government, of which I shall give the sub∣stance.</P>
<P>No propositions made to the general consulta,
shall acquire the force of laws, if they be not ap∣proved
by two thirds of the voices.</P>
<P>Propositions approved by one half of the voices,
may be proposed in the same session, a second or
third time: those which are not approved by one
half of the voices, cannot be proposed again, in
the same session; but may be brought in, with
consent of the government, in some future ses∣sion.</P>
<P>The supreme council of state shall consist of nine
counsellors, six of this side, and three of the other
side of the mountains, one for each province.
Three of them shall reside at Corte, during the first
four months; three during the second, and three
during the third: that is to say, during each space,
there shall be two of this side, and one of the other
side of the mountains; and the three in residence
shall have the authority of all the nine. But it shall
be lawful for the General, to call the whole nine to
the residence, whenever he shall think it necessary
on account of any important affair.</P>
<P>None of the three residing counsellors of state
shall be absent from the residence, for any cause
<PB N="184" REF="181"/>
whatever, without having first obtained leave in
writing, from the General; and this leave shall
not be granted for a longer time than eight days,
and but upon the weightiest motives. In case of
the General's absence from the residence, at the
same time that one of the three counsellors is
also absent, all judicial proceedings shall be sus∣pended.</P>
<P>No man shall be elected a counsellor of state,
who is not above thirty five years of age, and
who has not held with approbation, the office of
president in a provincial magistracy, or the of∣fice
of Podestà in some principal town. Notwith∣standing
which, however, any person of singular
merit, who has sustained with approbation, other
respectable charges, in the service of his country,
though he hath not borne the offices above-men∣tioned,
may be elected a counsellor, provided he
be of the age prescribed by law.</P>
<P>No man shall be appointed to the office of pre∣sident
of a provincial magistracy, who is under
thirty years of age, and who has not twice held
the office of consultor in the said magistracy, or
some other respectable employment in the service
of his country; and who has not the proper
knowledge necessary for that office.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="182"/>
The office of Podestà, in the towns not subject
to the provincial magistracy, shall be conferred
by the same regulations.</P>
<P>The charge of General of the kingdom, being
vacated by death, by resignation, or by any other
means, the whole of the supreme authority shall
then remain in the actual counsellors of state, the
eldest of whom shall preside at the council, by
which in the space of a month after the vacancy,
intimation must be made for a Consulta to be
held, for electing a new general.</P>
<P>The counsellors of state, the presidents of ma∣gistraies,
and other officers and judges, shall re∣main
in their respective charges, and have the
full exercise of their authority, till they are re∣lieved
by their lawful successours.</P>
<P>The counsellors of state, the presidents of pro∣vincial
magistracies, and the Podestàs of the larger
towns shall not be re-elected to the same charge,
without having been two years out of office, and
without producing credentials from the supreme
syndicators, attesting their good and laudable con∣duct
in the employment which they have exerci∣sed.</P>
<P>Paoli has succeeded wonderfully in settling the
claims of the feudal signors. These signors made
several applications to the government, praying
for the restitution of their ancient rights. This
<PB N="186" REF="183"/>
was a very delicate question. To allow to these
signors the ample privileges which they enjoyed
of old, would have been to establish indepen∣dent
principalities in Corsica, and must have
tended to subvert the enlarged and free consti∣tution,
which Paoli had formed, for the perma∣nent
felicity of the state.</P>
<P>The signors had not been foremost in the glo∣rious
war. They had much to lose; and hesi∣tated
at taking arms against the republick of Ge∣noa,
lest they should forfeit their domains.</P>
<P>The peasants, on the contrary, had plunged
at once into danger. These had nothing to lose
but their lives; and a life of slavery is not be
be prized. If they should be successful, they
were fired with the hopes of a double deliverance,
from the distant tyranny of the republick, and
from the more intimate oppression of their feudal
lords. This was become so grievous, that a
very sensible Corsican owned to me, that suppo∣sing
the republick had abandoned its preten∣sions
over Corsica, so that the peasants should
not have been obliged to rise against the Genoese,
they would have risen against the signors.</P>
<P>The peasants therefore, would not now con∣sent,
to return under the arbitrary power, from
which they had freed themselves, in consequence
of their bravery. To propose such a measure to
<PB N="187" REF="184"/>
them, would have been enough to excite a re∣volt,
to break the nation anew into parties, and
give their enemies an opportunity, of again fo∣menting
discord, and hatred, and assassinations;
till the Corsicans should themselves do, what all
that stratagem and force of Genoa had attempted
in vain.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the signors were not to be
offended, so as to make them become malecon∣tents,
and disturb the operations of the govern∣ment.
The motto of the sagacious Hollanders,
“Frangimur si collidimur, We shall go to pieces
if we dash against each other,” should be impres∣sed
on the minds of the different orders of men,
in every nation; but is doubly important in an
infant state.</P>
<P>Paoli indulged the signors so far, that they
themselves should not be personally amenable be∣fore
the magistrates of the provinces in which
their respective jurisdictions lie. That they should
have the power of determining causes between the
peasants upon their fiefs, without being respon∣sible
for their sentences, to the provincial ma∣gistrates;
but that they should be subject to the
review of the supreme council, and of the court
of syndicato.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="185"/>
In this manner, the signors have the flat∣tering
distinction of a certain degree of authority,
while, in reality, they are discharging the united
duties of fathers of the community, Podestàs,
and provincial magistrates. And as they are,
like them, subject to the cognizance of higher
judicatories, they cannot abuse their powers;
but while they enjoy a pre-eminence over the
other nobles, they just afford the state, at no
expence, an additional number of judges to pro∣mote
civilization among a rude and unpolished
people.</P>
<P>Thus have the hereditary feudal jurisdictions
been moderated in Corsica, by a fortunate con∣currence
of accident and wisdom; partly by the
tumults of a spirited war, partly by the prudent
dispositions of an able legislatour. And a system
transplanted from the north, by robust Barbarians,
into most countries of Europe, where having
taken deep root, and spread wide its branches,
the utmost violence has been required to extir∣pate
it, has, by a storm salutary to the island, and
by skilful management, been brought under
command, and even rendered useful in Cor∣sica.</P>
<P>When the government shall have arrived at
greater maturity, and time shall have abated the
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
ardour of rule, the signors will be disposed to re∣sign
a distinction attended with more trouble than
advantage.</P>
<P>In this manner is the Corsican government
carried on, and, no doubt, they will be able to
render it still more perfect; though as it now is,
I look upon it as the best model that hath ever
existed in the democratical form.</P>
<P>Sparta, indeed, was a nervous constitution;
but with reverence to the memory of immortal
Lycurgus, Sparta was deficient in gentleness and
humanity. That total inversion of the human af∣fections,
that extinction of every finer feeling,
was a situation so forced, and so void of pleasure,
that it is not to be envied. We must indeed ad∣mire
the astonishing influence of their legislatour.
But we may be allowed to think that all he ob∣tained
by it, was only the preservation of a state;
and preservation is nothing, without happiness.
Sir James Steuart is of opinion, that, “had the
Lacedemonians adhered to the principles of their
government, and spirit of their constitution, they
might have perhaps subsisted to this very day
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy, book II. chap. 14.</NOTE>.” I believe it might have been so. But,
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
could Lycurgus have changed his Spartans into
men of stone, they would have lasted still
longer.</P>
<P>In the constitution of Corsica, while proper
measures are taken for the continuation of the
state, individuals have the full enjoyment of all
the comforts of life. They are men, as well as
citizens; and when once they shall have entirely
freed themselves from the Genoese, I cannot ima∣gine
a country more happy. Animated with this
prospect, Paoli sways the hearts of his country∣men.
Their love for him is such, that although
the power of the General is properly limited, the
power of Paoli knows no bounds. It is high
Treason so much as to speak against, or calum∣niate
him; a species of despotism, founded, con∣trary
to the principles of Montesquieu, on the af∣fection
of love. I shall finish my account of the
government of this island, with a very remarka∣ble
anecdote.</P>
<P>A Corsican who had been formerly in the ser∣vice
of the French king, and had obtained the
cross of St. Louis, upon his return to his native
country, had entered into some practices which
were contrary to the liberty of it. He was also
suspected to have a design against the General's
life. Upon this he was sent to prison, from
<PB N="191" REF="188"/>
whence, however, after some time, he was, at
the intercession of the French general then in the
island, set at liberty. Not long after, he was
a second time caught in other secret and treason∣able
practices, and was again sent to prison. His
life was again asked, together with his freedom,
by the French commander; who being refused
this request, desired to know of Paoli what he
intended to do with the prisoner? “Sir,” said Pa∣oli,
“I will tell you. When I shall have per∣fected
the liberty of my country, and shall have
fixed it upon that establishment which I think
most likely to maintain it; I will then call to∣gether
the states of the island, and will produce
the man. I will shew him that liberty, that
form of government, that happiness which he
wanted to destroy. After which, I will banish
him from the island, for ever.” Such is the
manner of thinking of this illustrious chief.</P>
<P>The religion of Corsica is the Roman Catho∣lick
faith, in which these islanders are very zea∣lous.
Perhaps they have a degree of superstition;
which is the best extreme. No nation can prosper
without piety; for when that fails, publick spirit
and every noble sentiment will decay. The doc∣trine
of looking up to an all-ruling Providence,
and that of a future state of rewards and punish∣ments,
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
rendered the Roman people virtuous and
great. In proportion as these doctrines were
weakened, by the false philosophy of Epicurus,
the minds of the Romans were impoverished, and
their manly patriotism was succeeded by effemi∣nate
selfishness, which quickly brought them to
contempt and ruin.</P>
<P>Although firmly attached to their religion, as
the revelation sent from GOD, the Corsicans pre∣serve
in ecclesiastical matters, the same spirit of
boldness and freedom, for which they are distin∣guished
in civil affairs. They are sworn enemies
to the temporal power of the church. Indeed
the late violent differences between the national
government and the bishops, has pretty well di∣minished
their prejudices with respect to the per∣sons
of the clergy.</P>
<P>The Corsican bishops, who are five in num∣ber,
and suffragans of the archbishop of Pisa,
were warmly attached to Genoa; for on Genoa
they depended for promotion. They thought fit
to preach up the most slavish doctrines of sub∣mission,
and stigmatized the patriots as rebels.
The government desired that they might reside
in the territories of the nation, and promised
them a guard, to protect them from any insult.
But the bishops knew well, that in the territories
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
of the nation, they could not preach the doctrines
of tyranny, and therefore refused to reside there.
Upon which, the government prohibited the pa∣triots
from having any intercourse with the bi∣shops;
with which they most readily complied.</P>
<P>The Pope, sorry to see the Corsicans like
sheep without a shepherd, resolved to send them
an apostolick Visiter, to officiate in place of the
bishops.</P>
<P>The Genoese, considering this as in some mea∣sure
taking part with the malecontents, gave in a
long remonstrance to the Pope, setting forth,
“That they were sensible of the rectitude of the
intentions of his holiness, and were ever ready
to shew their unalterable devotion towards the
holy see: but they begged leave to say, that no
provision he should make against the spiritual
evils of Corsica, could be effectual, without the
concurrence of the republick.”</P>
<P>The Corsicans, happy to receive such counte∣nance
from the church, laughed at this laboured
and artful remonstrance. “Ecco la statua di Na∣bucco,
il capo d'oro e piedi di creta. Si comin∣cia
dal complimento, e si termina nella minac∣cia.
Behold the statue of Nebuchadnezar! the
head of gold, and the feet of clay. It begins
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
with a compliment, and ends with a threaten∣ing.”</P>
<P>The court of Naples thought proper to inter∣pose,
in behalf of Genoa. Cardinal Orsini, the
Neapolitan minister at the court of Rome, gave
also in remonstrances; and some very plodding
and heavy Genoese Canon, published a very long
Discorso Theologico-Canonico-Politico, full of
quotations from innumerable authorities, and no
doubt assured himself, that his performance was
unanswerable. But the Pope adhered to his reso∣lution,
and sent Monsignore Cesare Crescenzio de
Angelis, bishop of Segni, as apostolick Visiter
over all Corsica.</P>
<P>The Corsicans accepted of his mission, with
the greatest cordiality and joy. Signor Barbaggi,
who is married to the niece of Paoli, welcomed
him to the island, in a polite oration. He was
not only to perform the functions of the bishops,
but was to be general of all the Religious in Cor∣sica,
appointing under him a provincial vicar.
He was a man of so much piety, good sense, and
engaging conduct, that the people conceived an
universal love and regard for him.</P>
<P>The Genoese no longer continued their Ligu∣rian
deceit, but threw off the mask. They pu∣blished
<PB N="195" REF="192"/>
a manifesto, prohibiting all their subjects
in Corsica, under the heaviest penalties, to com∣ply
with the orders of the apostolick Visiter, and
offering six thousand Roman crowns, to any per∣son
who should bring him prisoner to any of their
fortresses.</P>
<P>This audacious edict the Pope very gravely
annulled, with great solemnity. Some ages ago,
he would have performed a more dreadful cere∣mony.
The government of Corsica again, pu∣blickly
proclaimed their displeasure, at the scanda∣lous
temerity of the republick of Genoa, “who,” said
they, “have sent forth an edict, by which they
have not only offended against the respect due
to the holy see; but have presumed to meddle
in the affairs of this kingdom, which no longer
acknowledges them as sovereign. Therefore we
declare the said edict, to be destructive of reli∣gion,
and of the apostolick authority; offensive
to the majesty of the vicar of Christ; seditious,
and contrary to the security and tranquillity of
our state, and tending to corrupt our laws and
good customs. And we have condemned it to
be publickly torn, and burnt, by the hands of
the common hangman: and this to prevent such
unworthy memorials from Genoa, in time com∣ing.”</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="193"/>
This sentence was put in execution, by beat
of drum below the gallows, in the city of Corte,
upon the spot where stood the house of the wretch
who assassinated Gaffori.</P>
<P>It was a most political step in the Corsicans.
They recommended themselves to the Pope; they
appeared firm, and authoritative; and they put
contempt upon their enemies.</P>
<P>Having thus got rid of their tyrannical bishops,
the Corsicans very wisely began to consider, that,
as these dignified churchmen refused to reside and
perform the duties of their offices, there was no
occasion for sending them considerable sums, to
enable them to live in idleness and luxury, when
the money might be much better employed.
They therefore thought it highly reasonable, that
the bishops tithes should go to the publick cham∣ber
of the state; and accordingly it was so de∣creed.</P>
<P>A prodigious outery was raised against this.
But the Corsicans defended their conduct with
great force and spirit.</P>
<P>“Hanno usurpate le decime, ed occupati i be∣ni
dei vescovi. They have usurped the tithes,
and seized upon the goods of the bishops,” said
the Genoese.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="194"/>
Replied the Corsicans, “Usurpate è mal detto.
Noi confesseremo la verità senza corda; perchè
qui ambulat simpliciter ambulat confidenter. Il
governo ha preso una porzione delle decime, e
dei beni de' vescovi; ed ecco perchè. Primo,
perchè ne ha avuta necessita; e questo è un di∣ritto
superiore ad ogni altro. Nello stato in cui
siamo, per noi non vi è mezzo. O libertà, o
schiavitù la più orribile. Per non cadere nella
schiavitù, è necessaria la guerra: per sostenere la
guerra, è necessaria la truppa; ma per pagarla,
non bastando le tasse dei secolari, fu stabilito in
una consulta, di prendre un sussidio dagli eccle∣siastici;
sull' esempio di S. Pietro, e di tutti i
principi. Ma i principi, si dice, non alimentano
una truppa ribelle. Una truppa che difende la
libertà, la vita, l'onore, e la patria, dalla più ini∣qua
di tutti le oppressioni, è più sacra, venerabi∣le,
e pia, di quella di una Crociata. Secondo,
perchè appunto per discacciare i Genovesi da
questo regno, Benedetto XI. concesse a Giacomo
rè di Arragona, per tre anni, le decime. Ora,
se il caso è lo stesso, il bisogno maggiore, più
pressanti le circonstanze, perchè non sarà lecito
adesso quel che fu conceduto allora? Terzo,
perchè niuno è più obligato dei nostri vescovi,
<PB N="198" REF="195"/>
di contribuire alle spese di questa guerra, da cui,
essi soli finora hanno ricavato profitto; ottenen∣do
una sacra mitra, che non avrebber ottenuta,
in mille anni di pace. Come? I secolari hanno
versato un fiume di sangue, per procurar loro un
si bel capitale, ed essi si faranno sentire per par∣ticiparne
qualche frutto; tanto più dovendo im∣piegarsi,
per conservare alla nazione lo stesso
vantaggio, e procurargliene dei maggiori? Quar∣to,
perchè i nostri vescovi, in vece di farla da
pastori e da padri, si portan da nemeci. Han
disertato dalle loro diocesi; si son ritirati presso à
nemici; hanno loro imprestate gran somme,
perchè ci facciano guerra; cela fanno eglino
stessi orribilmente, colle armi spirituali, e si sono
ostinati a non volersi restituire al suo gregge. Il
nostro governo, per obligarli al ritorno, si è ser∣vito
del ripiego, di cui si vaise Assalonne, per
ridurre al doverre Gioab. Or se essi sono di Gi∣oab
più caparbii, chi li compatirà? chi del nostro
governo riprenderà la condottà? Si aggiunga, che
i frutti di chi non risiede, di chi non serve l'Al∣tare,
e molto più di chi lo tradisce, son devoluti
a' poveri. Ora, chi più povera della nostra
truppa, della nostra finanza?”</P>
<P>“Usurped is ill said. We will confess the truth,
without disguise; since he who walketh simply,
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
walketh surely. The government hath taken a
portion of the tithes, and of the goods of the
bishops. And the reasons for it, are these, first,
because we are under a necessity to do so, which
is a right superiour to every other. In the situ∣ation
in which we are, there is no medium; or
liberty, or the most horrible slavery. Not to
fall into slavery, it is necessary for us to make
war. To sustain the war it is necessary for us
to have troops. And when we found, that the
taxes of the seculars were not sufficient to pay the
troops, it was decreed in a Consulta, that we
should take subsidy from the ecclesiasticks, after
the example of St. Peter, and of all princes.
But, say the Genoese, “Princes do not support a
rebel army.” An army which defends their
liberty, their life, their honour and their coun∣try,
from the most unjust of all oppressions,
is more sacred, more venerable, more pious
than that of a croisade. Secondly, because Be∣nedict
the XI. granted the tithes, for three years,
to James king of Arragon, on purpose that he
might drive the Genoese from this kingdom.
And if the case is the same, the necessity still
greater, and the circumstances more pressing,
shall not what was lawful then, be granted
<PB N="200" REF="197"/>
now? Thirdly, because nobody is under a
greater obligation to contribute to the expence
of this war, than our bishops; as they alone
have hitherto derived any profit from it; hav∣ing
obtained the sacred mitre, which they
would not have obtained in a thousand years
of peace. How? The seculars have shed a
river of blood, to procure them so noble a ca∣pital,
of which they have enjoyed the fruits,
and are they not in duty bound, to do every
thing to preserve to the patriots, what advan∣tage
they have gained, and to aid them in get∣ting
more? Fourthly, because our bishops, in∣stead
of being grateful, instead of acting like
pastours and fathers, have behaved themselves
as enemies. They have deserted their dioce∣ses,
and retired into the territory of our foes.
They have lent large sums of money, to car∣ry
on the war: nay they have themselves
shewn a dreadful hostility by their spiritual
arms, and have obstinately refused to return
to their flocks. To oblige them to return, our
government hath tried the same remedy which
Absalom employed, to bring Joab back to his
duty. If they are more froward than Joab,
who will feel for them? who will find fault
<PB N="201" REF="198"/>
with the conduct of our government? To
conclude, the tithes of those who do not re∣side,
who do not serve at the altar, and much
more of those who betray it, fall to the poor.
Now what can be poorer than our troops, than
our finances?”</P>
<P>The tithes in Corsica are, in general, about
a twentieth part of every production. The go∣vernment
has at present a pretty good share of
them; as it not only takes the revenues of the
bishops, but also those of nominal benefices,
where there is no care of souls, and all the pen∣sions
which the Pope used to grant to foreign ec∣clesiasticks,
out of the rich livings. When the
affairs of the island shall be settled, no doubt the
government will restore the bishops rents. But
application will be made to the Pope, to have
the number of bishops increased, in order that
the episcopal functions may be better administred,
and that the spirit of equality may be more pre∣served;
for the bishops, when in possession of
their large revenues, would be like princes in
the island.</P>
<P>Several of the inhabitants of Corsica, have
made a composition with the church, for their
tithes; and the descendants of the Caporali, who
<PB N="202" REF="199"/>
were of such service to Hugo Colonna, in ex∣pelling
the Saracens, are, by special privilege,
exempted from paying any tithes. This privi∣lege
is supposed to have been granted to them,
very anciently by the Pope, in whose cause it
was, that they shewed their zeal. The clergy of
Corsica, in general, are not as yet very learned;
as the barbarous policy of Genoa to keep the
island in ignorance, and the many years of con∣fusion
and war, have prevented the cultivation
of letters. There are, however, here and there,
some priests, who have had an education upon
the continent, and are very well instructed, and
they are all very pious, and of irreproachable
morals.</P>
<P>There are in Corsica, 65 convents of Men∣dicant
Friars; viz. 34 of Observants, and 14
of Reformed, of the order of St. Francis, and
17 of Capuchins. Every one of these convents,
has only a wood for retired walks, a garden and
a small vineyard. They depend altogether on
the charity of the people. There are two col∣leges
of Jesuits, two convents of Dominicans,
five of Servites, and one of Missionaries; all of
whom have very good possessions. There are
also some lands belonging to other religious
<PB N="203" REF="200"/>
orders, particularly to the Carthusians of Pisa,
the severe sanctity of whom, must secure them
the veneration of every body, and preserve their
rights inviolated even in times of the greatest
distraction.</P>
<P>It would be expected, that in this island, the
monasteries for women should bear some pro∣portion
to the convents for men; yet, in fact,
there is not a single nunnery in all Corsica. To
account for this, it must be considered that the
monastick institution has been frequently per∣verted
to secular purposes; so that the nobility
in catholick countries, who are desirous to ag∣grandize
their families, make their daughters take
the veil, solely that their portions may be saved
for the eldest son. The Genoese, who wanted to
keep the Corsicans in continual subjection, devi∣sed
every method to prevent any of the nobles in
the island from becoming considerable. They
therefore prohibited monasteries, in order to out
them off from one method of growing richer.
Eriars they rather encouraged, in order to lessen
population, and to leave upon families, a num∣ber
of unmarried women, than which nothing can
be a greater burden, as is sadly experienced in
protestant countries.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="201"/>
Convents should be laid under such restricti∣ons,
that what is intended as a solemn religious
institution, may not become so common as to lose
its effect, and be reckoned a profession for the
dull or the indolent.</P>
<P>Under proper restrictions, it must be for the
advantage of religion, to have a few venerable
sanctuaries, for the reception of those, who hav∣ing
done their duty to society, are so much raised
above the world, that they would choose entirely
to devote the evening of life, to pious contem∣plation
and prayer; not to mention those, whose
passions have hurried them into offences, for
which they sincerely resolve, by a course of ab∣straction,
of penitance and of voluntary austeri∣ties
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See that majestick teacher of moral and religious wis∣dom, the Rambler, number 110.</NOTE>, to make expiation to the eternal justice
of the DIVINITY.</P>
<P>From Paoli's care and attention to the good of
his country, it is probable the number of convents
in Corsica will be reduced. The present fathers
indeed, are well entitled to a peaceable posses∣sion,
during their lives; but regulations may be
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
made to prevent many noviciates, especially of
very young persons.</P>
<P>The Corsican clergy, and particularly the
monks, have been warmly interested for the
patriots. Padre Leonardo, a Franciscan, and
one of the professours of the university of Corte,
hath published a little tract, a “Discorso Sacro-Ci∣vile,”
teaching that those who fall in battle for
their country, are to be considered as martyrs.
This discourse hath had great effect. We know
what force of mind that doctrine hath given to the
Turks and to the Russians. Indeed, that patro∣tism
is a virtue which merits heaven, was held by
Cicero: “Omnibus qui patriam conservaverint,
adjuverint, auxerint, certus est in coelo et defi∣nitus
locus, ubi beati aevo sempiterno fruantur
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cic. Somn. Scip.</NOTE>. For those who have preserved, assisted
and aggrandized their country, there is a certain
and fixed place in heaven, where they are blest
with the enjoyment of eternal life.”</P>
<P>The warlik force of Corsica principally con∣sists
in a bold and resolute militia: every Corsi∣can
has a musket put into his hand, as soon as he
is able to carry it; and as there is a constant
<PB N="206" REF="203"/>
emulation in shooting, they become excellent
marksmen, and will hit with a single bullet a
very small mark at a great distance.</P>
<P>There is in every village a Capitano d'arme;
and in every pieve, a Commissario d'arme, who
has the command over all the Capitani d'arme of
his district. These officers are chosen by the
General, with the approbation of the people. They
are ever ready to receive his orders, and to call
out such a number of men, as he shall at any time
require for the publick service.</P>
<P>There are in Corsica, but 500 soldiers who
have pay; 300 for a guard to the General, and
200 to furnish guards for the magistrates of the
several provinces, and to garrison a few small forts
at particular places in the island.</P>
<P>A militia is indeed the true strength of a free
nation. Rome had no soldiers in pay till the
347 year after the building of the city; and
then they were introduced by the patricians, to
ingratiate themselves with the people, at a time
when the senate was embarrassed with the great
influence of the Tribunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. iv. cap. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="204"/>
Paoli devised a singular and excellent method
of promoting bravery among his countrymen.
He wrote a circular letter to the priests of every
parish in the island, desiring a list to be made out
of all those who have fallen in battle for their
country. The letter was in these terms.</P>

The priests have been very regular in making

adopted by every nation, as it would give double
courage to soldiers, who would have their fame
preserved, and at the same time leave to their re∣lations
the valuable legacy of a claim to the kind∣ness
of the state.</P>
<P>I have often wondered how the love of fame
carries the common soldiers of our armies, in∣to
the midst of the greatest dangers; when all
that they do is hardly known even to their re∣lations,
and never heard of in any publick man∣ner.</P>
<P>The Corsicans are not yet much trained, as
they have been acting chiefly upon the defensive,
and carrying on a sort of irregular war. But now
that they are advancing fast to a total victory over
their enemies, a certain degree of discipline be∣comes
necessary.</P>
<P>A Corsican is armed with a gun, a pistol and
a stiletto. He wears a short coat, of a very coarse
dark cloth, made in the island, with waistcoat
and breeches of the same, or of French or Italian
cloth, especially scarlet. He has a cartridge-box
or pouch for his ammunition, fixed round his mid∣dle,
by a belt. Into this pouch his stiletto is
<PB N="211" REF="208"/>
stuck; and on the left side of his belt he hangs
his pistol. His gun is slung across his shoulder.
He wears black leather spatterdashes, and a sort
of bonnet of black cloth, lined with red freeze,
and ornamented on the front, with a piece of some
finer stuff neatly sewed about. This bonnet is
peculiar to the Corsicans, and is a very ancient
piece of dress: it is doubled up on every side,
and when let down, is precisely the figure of a
helmet, like those we see on Trajan's pillar.
The Corsican dress is very convenient for tra∣versing
the woods and mountains; and gives a
man an active and warlike appearance.</P>
<P>The soldiers have no uniform; nor have the
Corsicans any drums, trumpets, fifes, or any in∣strument
of warlike musick, except a large Tri∣ton
shell pierced in the end, with which they
make a sound loud enough to be heard at a great
distance. The shell would more properly be used
atsea. Virgil represents Triton,</P>
<P>coerula concha</P>
<P>Extorrens freta.</P>
<P>Aeneid. lib. x. l. 209</P>
<Q><L>Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,</L>
<L>And at the blast the billows dance around.</L>
<L>DRYDEN.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="212" REF="209"/>
Colonel Montgomery has told me, that the
shell is used in America, particularly in Carolina.
Its sound is not shrill, but rather flat like that of
a large horn. It has however some resemblance
to that of the Roman Lituus. Sir John Cuning∣hame
of Caprinton has shewn me a Lituus in his
possession, of which mention is made in Blaeu's
Atlas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Blaeu's Atlas, p. 71. Province de Aire.</NOTE>. It was dug up in an ancient field of
battle at Coilsfield in Ayreshire, and served the
old barons of Caprinton to call together their fol∣lowers.</P>
<P>As the Corsicans advance in improvement, they
will certainly adopt the practice of having war∣like
instruments of musick, the effects of which
have been very great in ancient times, as we are
assured by Polybius, a judicious and grave histo∣rian,
a careful observer of human nature, and a
man not too much given to credulity. Even in
modern armies we find considerable effects pro∣duced
by them.</P>
<P>The Corsicans make a good many guns and
pistols, most of which are of excellent workman∣ship.
They also make great quantities of pow∣der;
but they have as yet no foundery for can∣non.
These they have either taken from their
enemies, or purchased from abroad, or fished from
<PB N="213" REF="210"/>
the wrecks of vessels lost in their seas. Neither
do they yet make their own bullets; they bring
them from the continent, or take them from the
Genoese, at whose expence they have contrived to
carry on the war. A Corsican told me that they
did not use a great many bullets, because, said
he, “Il Corso non tira, se non è sicuro del suo col∣po.
A Corsican does not fire, if he is not sure of
his aim.”</P>
<P>They are certainly designed by nature to be
strong at sea, having so many good harbours, and
so much excellent timber: but they are not yet
sufficiently skilled in the art of shipbuilding; nor
have they money sufficient to defray the expence
of employing proper artificers. They have how∣ever
a number of small ships, and some of a tole∣rable
size; and their naval affairs are conducted
with great prudence and spirit, by Count Peres,
who may be stiled High Admiral of Corsica.</P>
<P>We have seen how rich Corsica naturally is in
many productions; so that there is no question
but this island might carry on a pretty extensive
commerce, in oil, wine, honey, bees-wax, salt,
chestnuts, silk, rosin, boxwood, oak, pine, por∣phyry,
marble of various kinds, lead, iron, cop∣per,
silver and coral. At present, commerce is but
beginning to flourish among them. They find in
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
their seas considerable quantities of coral, of all
the three kinds, red, white and black. The Jews
of Leghorn, who have established there a coral
manufactory, have a sort of exclusive privilege,
from the Corsicans, to this trade; and in return
are very serviceable to the nation, by advancing
them money, and supplying them with cannon.</P>
<P>The Corsicans may make plenty of admirable
wines, for their grapes are excellent. They make
in Capo Corso two very good white wines; one
of them has a great resemblance to Malaga. A
deal of it is annually exported to Germany, and
sold as such; and some of it is bought up at
Leghorn, and carried to England, where it passes
equally well for the production of Spain. The
other of these white wines is something like Fron∣tignac.</P>
<P>At Furiani they make a white wine very like
Syracuse, not quite so luscious, and upon the
whole, preferable to it. Furiani is famous in the
Corsican annals, for a violent siege, where 500
Genoese were repulsed and defeated by 300 Cor∣sicans.</P>
<P>In some villages, they make a rich sweet wine
much resembling Tokay. At Vescovato and at
Campoloro, they make wine very like Burgundy;
and over the whole island there are wines of dif∣ferent
<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
sorts. It is indeed wonderful, what a dif∣ference
a little variation of soil or exposure, even
in the same vineyard, will make in the taste of
wine. The juice of the Corsican grapes is so ge∣nerous,
that although unskilfully manufactured,
it will always please by its natural flavour.</P>
<P>I think there might be a wine made in Cor∣sica
of a good sound moderate quality, some∣thing
between Claret and Burgundy, which would
be very proper for this country. But the Corsi∣cans
have been so harrassed for a number of
years, that they have had no leisure to improve
themselves in any art or manufacture. I am how∣ever
assured, that the exportation of oil has a∣mounted
in one year to 2,500,000 French livres,
and that of chestnuts to 100,000 crowns of the
same money.</P>
<P>We may expect to see the Corsicans distinguish
themselves as a commercial nation. Trade has al∣ways
flourished most in republican governments,
as in Tyre, Sydon and Carthage, in ancient times;
Venice, Genoa, Lucca and the United Provinces,
in modern times. This is fully illustrated by the
great John de Witt, pensioner of Holland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Witt's Interest of Holland, part III. chap. 3.</NOTE>,
<PB N="216" REF="213"/>
whose reflections were the result of the soundest
sense and a long experience.</P>
<P>Nothing has cast a greater damp upon the im∣provements
of Corsica, than the King of Great
Britain's proclamation after the late peace, forbid∣ding
his subjects to have any intercourse with
that nation. What may have been the reasons
of state for such a proclamation, I cannot take
upon me to say. It does not become me to look
behind the veil, and pry into the secrets of go∣vernment.
This much I may venture to assert,
that a good correspondence with Corsica would
be of no small advantage to the commercial in∣terest
of this country, were it only on account of
our fish trade and our woollen manufactures; not
to mention the various other articles of traffick
which would turn out to our mutual profit.</P>
<P>I know that if it had not been for this pro∣clamation,
the Corsicans would, at the close of
the last war, have had several of our stoutest pri∣vateers
in their service, which would have effec∣tually
overawed the Genoese, and given the brave
islanders an authority at sea, which could not
have failed to make them very respectable. And
surely it would be worthy of a people whom the
felicity of freedom has rendered generous, to af∣ford
their countenance to a race of heroes, who
<PB N="214" REF="214"/>
have done so much to secure to themselves the same
blessings, especially when our shewing this genero∣sity
would greatly coincide with the commercial
interests of these kingdoms.</P>
<P>It has been said, that it was the Duke de Niver∣nois,
who had interest enough with our ministers,
to obtain the proclamation in favour of the Geno∣ese.
Some politicians have exprest their surprise,
that Great Britain should have favoured Genoa,
which is always attached to the French; and when
it is notorious, that without its assistance, the
French could not have fitted out that fleet at Tou∣lon,
which enabled them to take Minorca; that
the Genoese continued building ships for them,
during the whole of the last war, and constantly
supplied them with seamen: whereas the Corsi∣cans,
as lovers of liberty, must naturally have a
respect for the British, as indeed is the case.</P>
<P>We may hope that other views will prevail in
the councils of this nation. A Sovereign possessed
of every virtue, who is animated with genuine
sentiments of liberty, and who feels the joy of
making his own people happy, would naturally
wish to extend his beneficence.</P>
<P>Agriculture is as yet in a very imperfect state
in Corsica. Their instruments of husbandry are
ill made; and they do not make the best use of
<PB N="218" REF="215"/>
what they have. Their plowing is but scratching
the surface of the earth; and they hardly know
any thing of the advantages of manure, though
they can be at no loss for sufficient quantities of it.
This general observation is not incompatible with
the large produce of several parts of the island,
where a greater degree of fertility, and some more
industry and attention to culture than usual are to
be found.</P>
<P>The supreme council appoints two or more per∣sons
in each province, to superintend the cultiva∣tion
of the lands, and to take the most effectual
measures for promoting it; and in particular, to
encourage the planting of mulberry trees, as it is
certain, that Corsica may be made to produce a
great deal of silk. As gardening has been almost
totally neglected, there is a late ordinance by
which every man who possesses a garden, or other
enclosure, is obliged to sow every year, pease,
beans and all sorts of garden-stuff, and not less
than a pound of each, under the penalty of four
livres, to be exacted by the Podestà.</P>
<P>The supreme council also appoints two consuls,
to inspect the kind and the price of the various
sorts of merchandise in the island; and to watch
over every thing that can tend towards the ad∣vancement
of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="216"/>
Provisions are not dear in Corsica. Their prices
at a medium are as follows.</P>
<P>A labouring ox, about 80 livres.</P>
<P>A cow, from 20 to 30 livres.</P>
<P>A horse of the best quality, from 100 to 140
livres.</P>
<P>A mare, from 70 to 80 livres.</P>
<P>An ass, from 20 to 25 livres.</P>
<P>A sheep, about 4 livres.</P>
<P>A partridge, 4 sous.</P>
<P>Thrushes and blackbirds, 2 sous each.</P>
<P>Beef, 2 sous a pound.</P>
<P>Mutton, 2 thirds sous a pound.</P>
<P>The best fish, 2 sous a pound.</P>
<P>Ordinary fish, 1 sou a pound.</P>
<P>Wine, 4 sous a flask of 6 lib. wt.</P>
<P>The money of Corsica is of the same value as
that of Tuscany.</P>
<P>Oil is sold in barrels valued from 40 to 50
livres. A barrel contains 20 pints. A pint con∣tains
4 quarts.</P>
<P>Wine is sold in barrels of 12 zuchas. The
zucha contains 9 large Florence flasks.</P>
<P>Grain is sold by the bushel. The bushel con∣tains
12 bacini. The bacino weighs about 20
pounds. The sack or bushel sells at 18 livres.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="217"/>
The Corsican pound weight is also the same
with that of Tuscany.</P>
<P>The government is gradually taking care to
establish an uniformity in weights and measures.</P>
<P>The wages of a tradesman, or of a day labour∣er,
are a livre a day, and victuals and drink.</P>
<P>If a tradesman is particularly ingenious in his
profession, he has something more.</P>
<P>Reapers have no wages in money; but besides
their victuals, each gets a bacino of the grain which
he cuts down.</P>
<P>The manufactures of Corsica are as yet very
rude. I have observed that their wool is exceed∣ingly
coarse, and generally black, and that of this
they make but a thick heavy cloth. The pure
black is the most valuable: when a little white
wool is mixed with it, the cloth is not so much
esteemed, being of a russet grey, or brown dusky
colour. They import all their fine cloth; for be∣sides
that there is not a sufficient quantity of wool
for the service of the island, the Corsicans have
not learned to make any thing else of it, but the
coarse cloth I have mentioned.</P>
<P>In Sardinia they make coverings for beds and
carpets of various colours, besides many different
stuffs for clothes. When the Corsicans have more
leisure, they will probably imitate their neighbours,
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
in those arts. Indeed over the greatest part of Ita∣ly,
none but the very peasants wear home-made
cloth; and if in some places they make cloth of a
finer kind, it is made of foreign wool imported
from different countries.</P>
<P>A good deal of flax grows in Corsica; and no
doubt abundance of it might be raised. I expect∣ed
to have found there, if not the fine webs of
Holland, Ireland and Scotland, at least plenty of
good, strong, household linen. But, in reality, the
Corsicans are as yet so backward, that they hardly
make any linen at all, which occasions a very ex∣pensive
importation.</P>
<P>A Corsican gentleman observed to me, “If we
had in our kingdom such an institution as the
Dublin Society, and a Doctour Samuel Madden
to give praemiums to those who distinguish them∣selves
in manufactures, as is done in the capital
of Ireland, we might soon bring our linen to
some perfection as well as other branches.”</P>
<P>The Corsicans have plenty of oil for their lamps,
which is the light they generally use. They also
make wax candles, and a few tallow ones; for, as
I have formerly remarked, their cattle do not
yield much fat.</P>
<P>There is plenty of leather in the island. Many
of the peasants just harden the hides in the air,
<PB N="222" REF="219"/>
particularly the wild-boar skins, and have their
shoes made of them without being tanned. This
they are under no temptation of doing, but that
of poverty and laziness, for the art of tanning is
very well understood in Corsica, and the materi∣als
for it are in such abundance, that a great deal
of bark is carried over to Italy. The Corsicans
have a method of tanning with the leaves of wild
laurel, dried in the sun, and beaten into a powder.
This gives a sort of a greenish colour to the leather.
Certainly various expedients may be used, to serve
the purpose of tanning. In the island of St. Kil∣da,
they tan with the tormentil root<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M`Aulay's History of St. Kilda, p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The state of learning in Corsica may well be
imagined at a very low ebb, since it was the de∣termined
purpose of Genoa to keep the inhabi∣tants
of this island in the grossest ignorance; and
the confusions and distresses of war have left them
no leisure to attend to any kind of study. “Inter
arma silent leges. Laws are silent amidst the din
of arms,” is an old observation; and it may be
justly applied to the muses, whom war frightens
away from every country.</P>
<P>Paoli and the wisest of the nation, with whom
he consults, very soon considered, that to bring
the people of Corsica to such a state as it might
<PB N="223" REF="220"/>
be hoped their freedom would last, and be carried
down pure and generous to posterity, it would be
necessary to enlarge their minds with the partici∣pation
of true science, and to furnish them with
sound and rational principles, by which the con∣stitution
might be held together in firmness.</P>
<P>Therefore, after long deliberation, it was at last
resolved in the year 1764, to establish an universi∣ty
in the city of Corte; upon which occasion a
manifesto<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. VI.</NOTE> was published, recalling to the peo∣ple
of Corsica, the barbarous policy of Genoa, in
keeping them in ignorance; and informing them
of the establishments, which the parental care of
the government had formed for their instruction.</P>
<P>This manifesto was no vain display of what
could not be performed. Paoli had been at the
greatest pains to collect the most knowing men in
the island; and many learned Corsicans establish∣ed
in foreign states, were disinterested and patrio∣tick
enough, to accept of the small emoluments
which Corte could afford. They thought them∣selves
amply rewarded, in having an opportunity
to contribute to the happiness of their native coun∣try,
by rescuing it from the Genoese darkness,
which was worse than that of the Goths, and en∣lightening
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
those heroes whose untutored patrio∣tism
had shone with such lustre.</P>
<P>The professours in the university of Corte, are
mostly fathers of different religious orders. They
are indefatigable in their labours, and the youth
of Corsica discover the same keenness of spirit in
their studies, which characterises them in arms.
There are at Corte, some pretty good halls, where
the professours give their lectures. But it cannot
be expected that they should as yet have any thing
like the regular buildings of a college. The stu∣dents
are boarded in the town.</P>
<P>Under the head of learning I must observe, that
there is a printing house at Corte, and a booksel∣ler's
shop, both kept by a Luccese, a man of some
capacity in his business. He has very good types;
but he prints nothing more than the publick ma∣nifestoes,
calendars of feast days, and little prac∣tical
devotional pieces, as also the Corsican Ga∣zette,
which is published by authority, from time
to time, just as news are collected; for it contains
nothing but the news of the island. It admits no
foreign intelligence, nor private anecdotes; so
that there will sometimes be an interval of three
months during which no news-papers are publish∣ed.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="222"/>
It will be long before the Corsicans arrive at
the refinement in conducting a news-paper, of
which London affords an unparalleled perfection;
for, I do believe, an English news-paper is the
most various and extraordinary composition that
mankind ever produced. An English news-paper,
while it informs the judicious of what is really
doing in Europe, can keep pace with the wildest
fancy in feigned adventures, and amuse the most
desultory taste with essays on all subjects, and in
every stile.</P>
<P>There are in Corsica, several treatises of poli∣tical
controversy, said in the title to be printed at
Corte: but they are in reality printed at Lucca,
or at Leghorn. In some of these treatises, of which
I have a pretty numerous collection, the authours,
with much care and thought, labour to prove to
a demonstration, that the Corsicans must be free.
Their writings are a good deal in the stile of the
profound tracts for and against the hereditary and
indefeasible right of kings, with which all the li∣braries
in this country were filled in the last age.
Authorities are heaped upon authorities, to esta∣blish
the plainest propositions; and as the poet says,
they

<PB N="226" REF="223"/>
The natural and divine prerogatives of liberty
need not the aid of logick, which has been so suc∣cessfully
employed by the advocates for slavery,
“To darken counsel by words without know∣ledge.”</P>
<P>The genius and character of the inhabitants of
Corsica deserve to be particularly considered, be∣cause
some authours in ancient times, and the
emissaries of Genoa in modern times, have re∣presented
them in the most unfavourable light.</P>
<P>In Muratori Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, vol.
xxiv. We find “Petrus Cyrnaeus de Rebus Corsi∣cis,”
in four books. This Petrus was a priest of
the diocese of Aleria, in the fifteenth century.
His family name was Filice; but he chose to
take to himself, the learned designation of Cyr∣naeus,
from Cyrnus the Greek name of his native
island. He was very poor, and sought a liveli∣hood,
in different parts of Italy, as a fort of pe∣dagogue,
and sojourned long at Venice as a cor∣rectour
of the press. At last having returned to his
mother country, he very piously composed its
history, which he brings down to the year 1516.</P>
<P>The only manuscript of this little work is in
the King of France's library; and Muratori pu∣blishes
it in 1738, when, says he, “Corsi fero∣cium
atque agrestium hominum genus, et in se∣ditionem
<PB N="227" REF="224"/>
facile pronum, serenissimae Genuensi∣um
republicae, conversis in rebellionem animis,
a multo tempore negotium non leve facessunt.
The Corsicans a rustik ferocious race of men,
and very prone to sedition, having turned their
minds to rebellion, have now of a long time gi∣ven
no small trouble to the most serene republick
of Genoa,” And he adds, “Qualem Petrus
Cyrnaeus gentem suam describit, perpetuis con∣tentionibus
ac turbis fluctuantem, talem praesens
quoque aetas agnoscit ac sentit. Such as Petrus
Cyrnaeus describes his nation fluctuating with
perpetual contests and tumults, such the present
age sees and acknowledges them.”</P>
<P>Petrus stands greatly up for the honour of the
island. He insists that a son of Hercules reigned
there. Strabo<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. v. cap. 225.</NOTE> tells us that a son of Hercu∣les
settled in Sardinia, which I suppose has given
occasion to the same report concerning Corsica.
As Livy say, “Datur haec venia antiquitati ut
primordia urbium augustiora faciat<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Liv. in Prooem.</NOTE>. Anti∣quity
is indulged with a privilege of rendering
the beginnings of states more august.”</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="225"/>
Petrus is a most enthusiastick patriot. He has
no patience with Strabo, who notwithstanding
the favourable account given of Corsica by Dio∣dorus
Siculus, hath chosen to convey the worst
idea both of the country and of its inhabitants.
Petrus declares, that one principal reason for his
writing is, “quia Strabonis mendacia vulgata esse
video, because I find Strabo's lies are gone a∣broad.”
And exclaims with all the fury of a true
son of Hercules; “Quum totam insulam lacerave∣rit,
non expostulemus? non accusemus? non
graviter feramus? * * * Quod si ego tacerem,
nonne parietes domus ubi natus sum, nonne ci∣vitas
ubi educatus sum exclamarent? When he
hath torn to pieces the whole island, shall we
not expostulate? Shall we not accuse? Shall we
we not provoked? * * * But if I should be
silent, would not the walls of the house where
I was born, would not the city where I was edu∣cated
cry out?”</P>
<P>It is indeed strange to find two such authours
as Strabo and Diodorus, differing so widely, and
seemingly contradicting each other. Strabo says,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="229" REF="226"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Strabo. lib. v. cap.
224. “But Cyrnus is by the Romans called
Corsica. It is ill inhabited, being rugged, and
in most places difficult of access; so that those
who dwell on the mountains, and live by rob∣beries,
are wilder than even wild beasts. There∣fore
when the Roman generals make irrupti∣ons
into their country, and falling upon their
strong-holds, carry off numbers of these people,
and bring them to Rome, it is wonderful to see
what wildness and brutality the creatures disco∣ver.
For, they either are impatient of life, and
lay violent hands on themselves; or if they do
live, it is in such a state of stupefaction and insen∣sibility,
that those who purchase them for slaves
have a very bad bargain, though they pay very
little money for them, and sorely regret their hap∣pening
to fall into their hands.” So far Strabo.</P>
<P>Diodorus on the other hand says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="230" REF="227"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> * * * * <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> * * * * <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Diod. Sicul. lib. v. cap. 225. “The Corsican
slaves seem to differ from all others, in their uti∣lity
for the offices of life, for which they are fit∣ted
by a peculiar gift of nature. * * * * These
islanders live among themselves with a humanity
and justice beyond all other barbarians. * * * *
In every part of the oeconomy of life, they shew
a remarkable regard to equity.”</P>
<P>Mr. Burnaby thinks these very different accounts
may be reconciled, by supposing the authours to
speak of the Corsicans, under different points of
view; Strabo as of enemies, Diordorus as of
friends; and then they will not only be found re∣concileable,
but will exactly correspond with the
character of the Corsicans at present. In war,
they are furious as lions. Death is esteemed no∣thing,
nor is any power sufficient to make them
yield against their inclination; they become
irritated, and will not brook-restraint<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">What Mr. Burnaby says of the Corsicans puts me in mind of an admirable observation of Sir Thomas Blount: “You may stroke the lion into tameness; but you shall sooner hew him into pieces, than beat him into a chain.” Sir Tho. Pope Blount's Essays, edit. Lond. 1697, p. 65.</NOTE>. Where∣as
<PB N="231" REF="228"/>
in peace, and in civil life, they are mild and
just to the greatest degree, and have all those a∣miable
qualities which Diodorus ascribes to them.
Where there service is voluntary too, or they are
attached to their masters, by kind and gentle treat∣ment,
they have the other perfections which he al∣lows
them.</P>
<P>My Lord Hailes thinks that there is properly
no contradiction between these illustrious authours;
since Strabo has not thrown any abuse upon the
Corsicans in general. He has only talked in strong
terms, of the barbarity of such of them, as inha∣bit
the mountains and live by robberies, just as
if writing concerning Scotland in former lawless
times, he had said, the Highlanders there are a
very wild set of men.</P>
<P>My Lord Monboddo thinks, there is nothing
more required to reconcile these different charac∣ters
of the Corsican slaves, but to suppose that
those which Diodorus had occasion to observe,
were well treated, and those which Strabo had
occasion to observe, were ill treated. For, good
or bad treatment was sufficient to make the Corsi∣cans
appear either of the one character, or of the
<PB N="232" REF="229"/>
other; as we may see in many barbarous nations
at this day.</P>
<P>But I shall suppose an universal ferociousness in
the Corsicans, and I think it may well be justified,
considering the treatment which that brave people
have met with from their oppressours. For, it is just∣ly
said by the philosopher of Malmsbury, “Prop∣ter
malorum pravitatem, recurrendum etiam
bonis est, si se tueri volunt, ad virtutes bellicas,
vim et dolum, id est ad ferinam rapacitatem<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hobbes de Cive. Epist. Dedic.</NOTE>.
By reason of the wicked oppression of the bad,
even a good people, must in self-defence, have
recourse to the qualities of war, force and fraud,
nay to a kind of savage rapacity.”</P>
<P>Petrus Cyrnaeus lays it down as a fixed princi∣ple,
“Universi Corsi liberi sunt, et propriis vi∣vunt
legibus. All Corsicans are free, and live
by their own laws.” And he gives this noble
eulogium to his country, “Corsica semper alumna
paupertatis, hospes virtutis, misericors erga om∣nes,
quam ascivit a severa disciplina quam usur∣pat
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muratori has it “usurpant,” which will not make sense. The text has certainly been corrupted. I am obliged to a
learned friend for correcting it to “usurpat.”</NOTE> et paupertatem tuetur et liberalitatem. Cor∣sica

<P>The fourth book of Petrus cyrnaeus is entirely
taken up with an account of his own wretched va∣gabond
life, full of strange, whimsical anecdotes.
He begins it very gravely, “Quoniam ad hunc lo∣cum
perventum est, non alienum videtur, de Pe∣tri
qui haec scripsit, vita et moribus proponere.
Since we are come thus far, it will not be amiss,
to say something of the life and manners of Pe∣trus
who writeth this history.” He gives a very
excellent character of himself; and I dare say a
very faithful one. But so minute is his narration,
that he takes care to inform posterity, that he was
very irregular in his method of walking, and that
he preferred sweet wine to hard. In short he was
a man of considerable parts, with a great simpli∣city
and oddity of character.</P>
<P>I shall now take leave of honest Petrus; with
whom perhaps some of my readers will choose to
cultivate a farther acquaintance.</P>
<P>The Corsicans are naturally quick and lively,
and have a particular turn for eloquence. Hie∣ronymus
<PB N="234" REF="231"/>
de Marinis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Graev. Thesaur. Antiq. vol. i. p. 1410.</NOTE> gives them this character:
“Montes apum examinibus abundant, et lacte ac
melle manant: apte etiam ad Corsorum ingeni∣um,
qui sub lingua, cum lacte et melle, habent
aculeum adeoque foro nati sunt. Their moun∣tains
abound in swarms of bees, and flow with
milk and honey; like the genius of the Corsicans,
who while they have milk and honey under their
tongues, have also a sting, and are therefore born
for the forum.”</P>
<P>I have in my possession two Corsican discourses,
of popular harangues, which afford specimens of
their eloquence. The one is entitled “La Corsi∣ca
a suoi Figli, Corsica to her Sons:” the other
“La Corsica a suoi Figli Sleali, Corsica to her Dis∣loyal
Sons.”</P>
<P>In the first of these harangues, the patriots are
thus encouraged to proceed in the glorious cause:
“Seguitate voi dunque l'esempio dei salvatori del∣la
lor patria, e siate sicuri, che la libertà sarà il pre∣mio
delle vostre fatiche; e che all ombra amena
della libertà, racoglierete i soavi frutti di sicu∣rezza,
e di pace, di abondanza, e di contentez∣za;
di avanzamento, e di gloria. Frutti, che
vi riusceranno tanto più dolci, quanto più lun∣gamente
ne siete stati fuor di raggione privati
<PB N="235" REF="232"/>
dalla malignità dei vostri oppressori. Follow
then the example of the saviours of their coun∣try;
and be assured that liberty will be the re∣ward
of your toils; and that under the pleasing
shade of liberty, you will gather the agreeable
fruits of security, of peace, of abundance and of
contentment, of exaltation and of glory. Fruits
which will be the sweeter to you, the longer you
have been unreasonably deprived of them, by
the malignity of your oppressours.”</P>
<P>In the second of these harangues, such of the
nation as shewed any wavering or timidity, are
thus roused against the Genoese: “Ecco la po∣tenza
che si vorrebbe indurvi a temere. Voi
l'avete sprezzata, e ne avete trionfato nel tempo
della vostra maggior debolezza, nel tempo ch'
eravate sproveduti d'armi, di munizioni, di ba∣stimenti,
di porti, di finanze, e di truppa paga∣ta;
nel tempo che i vostri capi erano novizii nel
governo militare e politico, civile ed economico,
e che tutti questi governi riuscivano loro gravi e
dispendiosi; nel tempo che i partiti alzavano ar∣ditamente
la cresta, e da per tutto alla scoperta
seminavano la zizania; che la parte oltramontana
era dalla cismontana independente e divisa; che
dominio della nazione era mal sicuro e mal no∣to.
<PB N="236" REF="233"/>
Ora poi, che con un cambiamento felice,
siete proveduti a soprabbondanza, d'armi e mu∣nizioni;
a sufficienza, di bastimenti e di porti;
che avete stabilita la truppa ed i fondi per
la sua suffistenza; liberi perciò dagl'incom∣modi
di molte spedizioni, e da i disordini che
la truppa collettiva portava seco; che avete in∣stituite
le vostre finanze; che i vostri capi si tro∣vano

over it, in the time of your greatest

a time when your chiefs were novices in govern∣ment,
whether military or political, and when
all these branches of government were heavy

audaciously held high their crests, and in

nation was insecure and little known. And,
when by a happy change in affairs, you are a∣bundantly
provided with arms and ammunition,
and are sufficiently accommodated with ships

regulated your finances, when your chiefs find

and under a chief, (I will say it to the shame of
malignity and of envy) who for wisdom and fore∣sight,
for zeal and disinterestedness, for courage
and valour, for the rectitude of his intentions,
views and maxims, does not yield to any of the
most famous heroes. Now, I say, when you
are in a situation more strong and flourishing
than ever, and which, if you are constant in your
undertakings, promises you immortal glory, a
total independence and a perpetual felicity; shall
you be afraid of the vain, the pitiful, the con∣temptible
power of the republick?”</P>
<P>The language of the Corsicans is remarkably
good Italian, tinctured a little with some remains
of the dialects of the barbarous nations, and with
a few Genoese corruptions, but much purer than
in many of the Italian states. Their pronunci∣ation
however is somewhat coarse. They give in
particular a broad sound to the vowel E which
displeased me a good deal. That the Corsicans
write Italian in a great degree of perfection may
be seen from some quotations in the course of this
account, as well as from the manifestoes subjoin∣ed
in the Appendix.</P>
<P>The Corsicans have all a turn for the arts. I
cannot indeed say that painting has yet flourish∣ed
<PB N="239" REF="236"/>
among them; but they succeed well in musick
and poetry. There are few of them who do not
play upon the citra, an old Moorish instrument,
which they are pleased to think the ancient cytha∣ra.
It has a sweet and romantick sound, and
many of their airs are tender and beautiful.</P>
<P>They have not yet produced any large and
finished poem. But they have many little pieces
exceedingly pretty, most of them on war or on
love. Old Giacinto Paoli, father to the present
general, has left several sonnets composed with
great spirit. I have a good many of them; and
shall insert one, of which I have attempted a
translation. It was composed in praise of his bro∣ther-commander
General Giafferi, upon occasion
of a victory obtained by him over the Genoese,
at the siege of Cordone; and while it gives a
specimen of the talents of the venerable chief, it
at the same time shews his generous satisfaction
at the success of another engaged in the same glo∣rious
cause.</P>

They have also many little ballads and madri∣gals,
full of drollery and keen satire against the
Genoese; and they have their essays of grave hu∣mour,
and various allegories respecting themselves
and their enemies. They have in particular a cu∣rious
paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer, where all
the petitions are strangely turned into severe accu∣fations
against the Genoese.</P>
<P>The character of the Corsicans has been al∣ready
touched, in the comparison between Strabo
and Diodorus. Siculus. They are no doubt a
people of strong passions, as well as of lively and
vigorous minds. These are the materials, of
which men are to be formed either good or bad
in a superiour degree. I always remember an
observation which M. Rousseau made to me, one
day, in the Val de Travers, when we were talk∣ing
of the characters of different nations; said he,
“J'aime ces caracters ou il y a de l'etoffe.” It
was well said. A poor feeble spirit is unable to
support the weight of great virtues. It is only
where there is strength and fire, that we can hope
to form characters of worth and dignity.</P>
<P>These islanders have abilities for any thing:
but their fourtune has been such, that they have
been conspicuous only for the hard and resolute
qualities. Abandoned by the nations around to
<PB N="242" REF="239"/>
the oppression of a tyrannical republick, they have
had no opportunity of shewing their genius for
learning and the arts, their hospitality, their cour∣teousness,
and their other amiable virtues in civi∣lized
life. What they have had an opportunity
to shew, they have shewn with distinguished glory.</P>
<P>The authours of the Encyclopedie say, “Les
Corses sont remuans, vindicatifs, et belliqueux.
The Corsicans are tumultuous, vindictive and
warlike.” Their struggles against the tyrant
could shew them in no other light.</P>
<P>A writer of the highest class thus characterises
them: “Les Corses sont une poignée d'hommes
aussi braves et aussi deliberès que les Anglois.
On ne less domptera, je crois, que par la pru∣dence
et la bontè. On peut voir par leur ex∣emple,
quel courage et quelle vertu, donne
aux hommes l'amour de la libertè, et qu'il est
dangereux et injuste de l'opprimer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Essai de Crit. sur le Prince de Machiavel. p. 114.</NOTE>. The
Corsicans are a handful of men, as brave and as
determined as the English. I believe they will
not be subdued but by prudence and good
treatment. We may see by their example, what
courage and what virtue the love of liberty gives
to men; and how dangerous as well as unjust
it is to oppress it.”</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="240"/>
The manners of the Corsicans have a great si∣milarity
with those of the ancient Germans, as
described by Tacitus. They have not however
the same habit of drinking; for they are extreme∣ly
temperate. Their morals are strict and chaste
to an uncommon degree, owing in part to good
principles unhurt by luxury; and partly to the
exercise of private revenge against such as violate
the honour of their women.</P>
<P>This last may to some appear rude and barba∣rous;
but I hold it to be wise and noble. Better
occasional murders than frequent adulteries. Bet∣ter
cut off a rotten branch now and then, than
that the whole of the society should be corrupted.
When morals are intimately connected with ideas
of honour, and crimes of an alluring nature are
not committed with impunity, we may expect
that mankind will retain a proper awe, and be
kept within the bounds of their duty: and if we
have not the frivolous embellishments and transi∣ent
pleasures of licentious gallantry, we are free
from its effeminate disquiets, its feverish passions,
its falseness and dissimulation; while honest prin∣ciples
and manly and generous affections are kept
in full vigour.</P>
<P>They who think duelling necessary to preserve
the nice decorum of politeness, ought not to cen∣sure
<PB N="244" REF="241"/>
private revenge, the rough guardian of that
virtue which is the support of every community.</P>
<P>What Tacitus says of ancient Germany we may
say of Corsica: “Nemo illic vitia ridet; nec cor∣rumpere
et corrumpi saeculum vocatur<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>. No∣body
there laughs at vice; nor is corrupting and
being corrupted called the way of the world.”</P>
<P>The Corsicans like the Germans of old, are
extrmely indolent. The women do the greatest
part of the drudgery work<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>, as is also the cus∣tom
among the Scots Highlanders. Yet they are
very active in war, like the same Germans, of
whom Tacitus says, “Mira diversitate naturae
cum iidem homines sic ament inertiam et ode∣rint
quietem<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>. By a wonderful variety of na∣ture
the same men are fond of indolence and
impatient of rest.” Notwithstanding all that
Paoli has done, the Corsicans are still indolent
and averse to labour. Every year 800 or 1000
Sardinians and Luccese are employed as artificers
and day-labourers in the island.</P>
<P>M. De Montesquieu observes, that all indolent
nations are also proud. This is indeed the case
of the Corsicans, to which, as I have formerly ob∣served,
their success in war has contributed.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="242"/>
M. De Montesquieu proposes a very good re∣medy
for this: “On purroit tourner l'effet contre
la cause, et detruire la paresse par l'orgueil. Dans
le midi de l'Europe, où les peuples sont si fort
frappés par le point d'honneur, il seroit bon de
donner des prix aux laboureurs qui auroient
portè plus loin leur industrie. Cette pratique
a reussi de nos jours en Irlande; elle y a établi
une des plus importantes manufactures de toile
qui soit en Europe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Esprit des Loix, liv. xiv. chap. 9.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“One might turn the effect against the cause,
and destroy indolence by pride. In the south
of Europe, where the people are so much struck
with the point of honour, it would be right to
give premiums, to the labourers who have best
cultivated their fields, or to artificers who have
carried their industry the greatest length. This
practice hath succeeded in our days, in Ireland:
it hath there established one of the most impor∣tant
linen manufactures in Europe.”</P>
<P>The Corsicans love much to lie round a fire.
This practice seems peculiar to rude nations. The
Indians in north America do it, and the ancient
Germans did it. “Totos dies juxta focum atque ig∣nem
agunt<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tacit, de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>. They pass whole days by the fire.”
The Scythians too had this custom.</P>

<P>There have been many very strange customs
in Corsica. Diodorus tells us, that after the wo∣men
were brought to bed, the men immediately
took care of the children, laying themselves down
as if they were sick, and fondling the infants, so
that the mothers had no farther trouble than to
give them suck<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sicul. Wesseling. p. 341.</NOTE>. So great attention to a wo∣man
after she has suffered so much for the good
of society, had really something humane in it;
though we must smile at such simplicity. We
may say that it has never been paralleled by all
the complaisance of modern gallantry. But this
equitable custom is no longer in use.</P>
<P>Petrus Cyrnaeus says, that in his time marriage
was so much honoured among the Corsicans, that
if any young woman was so poor that nobody
asked her, the neighbours raised a contribution to
<PB N="247" REF="244"/>
help her to a husband. Generosity could never
be more properly exercised. Epaminondas used
to exercise his generosity in that way<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Corn. Nep. in vit. Epam.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are some extraordinary customs which
still subsist in Corsica. In particular they have se∣veral
strange ceremonies at the death of their re∣lations.
When a man dies, especially if he has
been assassinated, his widow with all the married
women in the village accompany the corpse to the
grave, where after various howlings, and other
expressions of sorrow, the women fall upon the
widow, and beat and tear her in a most miserable
manner. Having thus satisfied their grief and
passion, they lead her back again, covered with
blood and bruises, to her own habitation. This
I had no opportunity of seeing, while I was in
the island; but I have it from undoubted autho∣rity.</P>
<P>Having said so much of the genius and charac∣ter
of the Corsicans, I must beg leave to present
my readers with a very distinguished Corsican
character, that of Signor Clemente de' Paoli, bro∣ther
of the General.</P>
<P>This gentleman is the eldest son of the old
General Giacinto Paoli. He is about fifty years
of age, of a middle size and dark complexion, his
<PB N="248" REF="245"/>
eyes are quick and piercing, and he has something
in the form of his mouth, which renders his ap∣pearance
very particular. His understanding is
of the first rate; and he has by no means suffered
it to lie neglected. He was married, and has an
only daughter, the wife of Signor Barbaggi one
of the first men in the island.</P>
<P>For these many years past, Signor Clemente,
being in a state of widowhood, has resided at
Rostino, from whence the family of Paoli comes.
He lives there in a very retired manner. He is
of a Saturnine disposition, and his notions of re∣ligion
are rather gloomy and severe. He spends his
whole time in study, except what he passes at his
devotions. These generally take up six or eight
hours every day; during all which time he is in
church, and before the altar, in a fixed posture,
with his hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, with
solemn fervour.</P>
<P>He prescribes to himself, an abstemious, rigid
course of life; as if he had taken the vows of
some of the religious orders. He is much with
the Franciscans, who have a convent at Rostino.
He wears the common coarse dress of the coun∣try,
and it is difficult to distinguish him from one
of the lowest of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="246"/>
When he is in company he seldom speaks, and
except upon important occasion, never goes into
publick, or even to visit his brother at Corte.
When danger calls, however, he is the first to
appear in the defence of his country. He is then
foremost in the ranks, and exposes himself to the
hottest action; for religious fear is perfectly con∣sistent
with the greatest bravery; according to
the famous line of the pious Racine,</P>
<Q><L>Je crains DIEU, cher Abner; et n'ai point d'autre
crainte.</L>
<L>I fear my GOD; and Him alone I fear.</L></Q>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>A FRIEND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>In the beginning of an engagement, he is ge∣nerally
calm; and will frequently offer up a
prayer to heaven, for the person at whom he is
going to fire: saying he is sorry to be under the
necessity of depriving him of life; but that he is
an enemy to Corsica, and providence has sent him
in his way, in order that he may be prevented
from doing any father mischief; that he hopes
GOD will pardon his crimes, and take him to him∣self.
After he has seen two or three of his coun∣trymen
fall at his side, the case alters. His eyes
flame with grief and indignation, and he becomes
<PB N="250" REF="247"/>
like one furious, dealing vengeance every where
around him.</P>
<P>His authority in the council is not less than his
valour in the field. His strength of judgment
and extent of knowledge, joined to the singular
sanctity of his character, give him great weight in
all the publick consultations; and his influence
is of considerable service to his brother the Ge∣neral.</P>
<P>When we thus view the Corsicans gloriously
striving for the best rights of humanity, and un∣der
the guidance of an illustrious commander and
able statesman, establishing freedom, and form∣ing
a virtuous and happy nation, can we be in∣different
as to their success? Can we Britons
forbear to admire their bravery, and their wis∣dom?

him for the spirit he hath shewn; and I would

The Corsicans are in general of small stature,
and rather hard-favoured, much like the Scots
Highlanders; though as we find among these, so
we also find among the Corsicans many of a good
size, and comely countenances.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in Corsica has not
been exactly taken of late, but they may be reck∣oned
220,000 souls; for, previous to the rise in
1729, there were 40,000 families who payed tax
to Genoa, and reckoning five to each family, the
inhabitants were then 200,000.</P>
<P>Now although it may appear a paradox, it is
certain that the number of inhabitants has in∣creased
during the war; as will appear from the
following considerations.</P>
<P>Father Cancellotti a Jesuit missionary, who
travelled over Corsica, and informed himself with
great exactness, made a computation, that in thirty
years of Genoese government, the island lost by
assassinations and other causes 28,000 people.</P>
<P>Whereas in the thirty seven years of war, the
island has not lost above 10,000 people, including
those who have fled from the confusions of their
country, to follow fortune upon the continent.</P>
<P>And therefore this calculation of the number
of inhabitants at present, is a just one.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="250"/>
The number of Corsicans is however much less
than it was in ancient times. It is well observed
by an able writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wallace on the Numbers of Mankind, p. 106.</NOTE>, “That the depopulation of
many countries seems to have been first occasion∣ed
by the havock the Romans made among the
smaller states and cities, before they could fully
establish their sovereign power.” In no state
could this cause of depopulation take place, more
than in Corsica; for in no state were the natives
harder to be subdued. When to the Roman ha∣vock
we add the reiterated turmoils, which dur∣ing
a course of ages, have shaken this island,
we need be at no loss to account why the number
of its inhabitants is diminished.</P>
<P>Of the 220,000 people computed to be in Cor∣sica,
there may be 10,000 in Bastia, and in all
25,000 in the territories of the Genoese; so that
I reckon there are about 200,000 of the patriotick
nation, and of these Paoli can bring 40,000 armed
men into the field.</P>
<P>It is therefore by no means probable, that the
Genoese should reduce to abject submission so con∣siderable
a nation, and a nation of such men;
most of whom have been born in the troublous
times, and been brought up with sentiments of
<PB N="254" REF="251"/>
the most violent hatred against the republick.
There is not a Corsican child who can procure a
little gun-powder, but he immediately sets fire to
it, huzzas at the explosion, and as if he had
blown up the enemy, calls out, “Ecco i Geno∣vesi.
There go the Genoese.”</P>
<P>I believe the wisest and best nobles of Genoa
are now of opinion, that the republick should re∣noucne
her pretensions of dominion, over a peo∣ple
whom long experience has proved to be un∣conquerable
by the Genoese arms, who have baf∣fled
every attempt that the republick has made a∣gainst
them, and who are at last formed into a
state that has a solid claim to independency. But
the wisest and best of Genoa, like the wisest and
best of other states, are over-ruled by the majori∣ty;
and the republick has hitherto continued to
drain her treasury, and sacrifice her soldiers, in
fruitless attempts to recover Corsica.</P>
<P>The Abbé Richard<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Richard Descrip. Hist. et Crit. de l'Ital. tom. I. p. 118.</NOTE> hath given a very just
and lively account of this: “Le royaume de
Corse dont la republique possede quelques places
maritimes lui coute prodigieusement; elle n'en
retire aucun avantage réel, et elle a toujours à
combattre un peuple indiscipliné armé pour la li∣berté.”</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="252"/>
“Mais comme les nobles Genois se regardent
tous comme solidairement rois de Corse, cette
raison qui est forte sur leur esprit, les determi∣nera
toujours à ne rien epargner pour conserver
au moins ce titre. C'est l'objet d'ambition qui
les touche le plus. Rien n'est aussi interessant pour
eux, que les nouvelles de ce païs; sur tout quand
la ballance paroit pancher du coté des rebelles.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He should not call those “rebelles” whom he hath be∣fore represented as “armés pour la liberté.”</NOTE></P>
<P>“Une dame Genoise fort inquiete de quelques
succès qui sembloient annoncer une revolution

esperances de la republique se retablissoient, dit

sommes donc encore un peu reines.”</P>
<P>“The kingdom of Corsica, of which the repu∣blick
possesses some maritime strong places, costs
her a prodigious expence. She derives no real ad∣vantage
from it, and she hath always to combate
an undisciplined people armed for liberty.”</P>
<P>“But as the Genoese nobles look upon them∣selves
to be all joint kings of Corsica, this consi∣deration
which is very strong upon their minds,
will ever determine them to spare nothing in or∣der
to preserve at least the title. It is the point
of ambition which touches them the most, No∣thing
<PB N="256" REF="253"/>
is so interesting to them as the news from
that country, especially when the balance seems
to lean to the side of the rebels (patriots).”</P>
<P>“A Genoese lady who was very uneasy, on ac∣count
of some successes which seemed to an∣nounce
a total revolution in favour of the islan∣ders,
hearing that the hopes of the republick be∣gan
to be re-established, cried in a transport of
joy,” “Thank GOD then, we are yet somewhat
queens.”</P>
<P>While I was employed in writing this Account
of Corsica, the brave islanders resolved on strik∣ing
a bold stroke, and making a conquest of the
island of Capraja.</P>
<P>Capraja or Caprara lies to the east of Corsica,
about five and twenty miles off Capo Corso, over
against the coast of Tuscany. This island was
formerly annexed to the kingdom of Corsica, be∣ing
a portion of the feudal territory of the noble
family of Damari who were deprived of it by the
Genoese.</P>
<P>Capraja is about fifteen miles in circumference.
The whole of it is exceedingly mountainous, and
of a dry craggy surface. It is all around so pointed
with rocks, that it is inaccessible almost on every
quarter, except at one habour, which is a pretty
good one, and where numbers of vessels passing
<PB N="257" REF="254"/>
the Mediterranean use to take shelter. It hath
upwards of 3000 inhabitants, all of whom are as∣sembled
in a town at the extremity of the island
just above the harbour.</P>
<P>The men of Capraja are strong and robust.
They all go to sea, and are reckoned the hardiest
and most expert sailors in that part of the world.
The women employ themselves chiefly in cultiva∣ting
vines, in which the island is pretty fertile.
There is here a strong citadel built on a high rock,
so that it commands the town and harbour. It is
well furnished with artillery, and the Genoese kept
there a garrison. There are also two other towers
at the two extremities of the island, built rather
in order to descry the Barbary corsairs, than to
defend a country so well fortified by nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know Capraja well, for I was driven into it by stress of weather in my return from Corsica. I was detained there six days, and was lodged in a Franciscan convent, where the worthy fathers entertained me very hospitably. I employed my time in writing a minute detail of every thing in the island, which I still have by me, and often amuse myself with it, at a vacant hour.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the month of December 1766, Signor Paul
Mattei of Centuri having gone to France to tran∣sact
some private affairs, in his passage home he
went ashore at Capraja, where he was at great
<PB N="258" REF="255"/>
pains to inform himself with regard to the situation
of their garrison, their harbour and their coasts,
the scarcity of provisions, and the little attention
with which the island was defended.</P>
<P>On his return to Corsica, he proposed to Paoli
to make a descent upon Capraja. His proposal
was immediately approved, and the conduct of the
enterprise was committed to Signor Achilles Mu∣rati,
commandant at Erbalonga, and Signor John
Baptist Ristori, commandant at Furiani, who on
the evening of the 16th of February 1767, set sail
from the port of Macinajo, accompanied by Signor
Mattei and several gallant young gentlemen of the
principal families in the provinces of Capo Corso
and Nebbio, who chose to go as volunteers.
They had also a few Capraese to serve as guides.</P>
<P>They landed on Capraja that night. The Cor∣sican
commanders signified to the Capraese, that
they were come with no hostile intentions against
them; but only to expel from their country, the
Genoese, that the inhabitants of Capraja might
participate the happy fruits of liberty, in common
with their ancient friends the Corsicans: and there∣fore
they hoped that instead of meeting with op∣position,
they would be received with cordiality.
Upon this, a number of the inhabitants immediate∣ly
joined them, and they laid siege to the citadel.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="256"/>
The Genoese were piqued to the greatest de∣gree,
to find that those islanders, whom they gave
out to be a set of rebels under the awe of a French
guard, were boldly sallying forth, and wresting
from them the sovereignty of another island in the
Mediterranean; an event which could not fail to
blaze abroad over Europe, and equally contribute
to the glory of the Corsicans and to the disgrace
of the republick. They therefore spared no ex∣pence
or care to defeat the enterprise.</P>
<P>They sent out a considerable armament under
the command of Signor Augustino Pinello, a man
of tried activity and valour, and an actual sena∣tour
of Genoa.</P>
<P>They also sent colonel Antonio Matra, with a
body of chosen men, who by the assistance of a Ca∣praese
galley-slave effectuated a landing, at a
place neglected by the Corsicans as inaccessible.</P>
<P>While Matra attacked the Corsicans by land,
Signor Pinello attaked them from the sea, on two
different quarters; so that they had a very hot
and difficult action to maintain. Notwithstand∣ing
all which, Pinello was beaten off, and Ma∣tra's
detachment was totally routed.</P>
<P>I could wish to relate the various particulars of
this expedition. I have materials sufficient for it;
but the plan of my work does not permit me.
<PB N="260" REF="257"/>
The citadel of Capraja surrendered on the 29th of
May.</P>
<P>The Corsicans have by this conquest added
considerably to their dominion. They have acquir∣ed
an increase of most useful people; and they
are in condition to prevent, or at least render ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remely
difficult, the communication between
Genoa and her garrisons in Corsica.</P>
<P>Sir James Steuart hath placed the Corsicans in
rather an unfavourable light. His words are, “The
Corsicans have exported, that is, sold the best
part of their island to Genoa;” and now, after
having spent the price in wearing damask and
velvet, “they want to bring it back, by confisca∣ting
the property of the Genoese, who have both
paid for the island, and drawn back the price
of it, by the balance of their trade against these
islanders<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy. Book II. Chap. 29.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>With this respectable writer' permission, it was
not a balance of trade, but a ballance of bad for∣tune,
which subjected Corsica to the Genoese; and
the greatest part, if not all the property of the no∣bles
of the republick in that island, was acquired
only by force or by fraud. The expensiveness of the
Corsicans in wearing damask and velvet, is merely
<PB N="261" REF="258"/>
ideal. Corsica is perhaps the only country upon
the face of the globe, where luxury has never
once been introduced. The Genoese cannot
pretend to have made themselves masters of Cor∣sica,
by commercial superiority; for those repu∣blicans
have been supplied from that fertile island,
with a great many of the necessaries of life, which
their own narrow dominions could not furnish in
sufficient quantities.</P>
<P>I have thought myself called upon to rectify this
mistake in a book which may afford many impor∣tant
lessons to free nations, and among the rest to
the brave Corsicans themselves.</P>
<P>It is in vain for the Genoese to pretend any lon∣ger
that the Corsicans are to be looked upon as re∣bels.
It is nobly opposed by a Corsican writer;
with whose words I shall conclude my Account of
Corsica.</P>
<P>“Rebelli! come non hanno vergogna di dar a
noi questo titolo? a noi che facciamo la guerra
con tanto spirito di lenità e di dolcezza, che non
altro si studia che risparmiare il sangue, i beni, e
l' onore de' nostri concittadini? a noi che non
cercando se non di liberare la patria della più ini∣qua
di tutte le cattività, altro titolo non conviene
che quello di salvatori. E poichè lode a D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o da∣tor
d'ogni bene, abbiamo già conseguito l'inten∣to;
poichè abbiamo già formato in sequela un
<PB N="262" REF="259"/>
governo sovrano libero, independente, assoluto,
padrone della vita e della morte di tante migliaja
di sudditi, che lo riconoscono, ed ubidiscono con
fedeltà e con prestezza. Avendo stabilito suc∣cessivamente
rota e tribunali; giudici e magis∣trati;
ministri ed esecutori di giustizia; secrete∣rie
e cancellerie; aperte stamperie; composte
leggi e statuti; truppe e finanze; poichè sotto

<P>“Rebels! are they not ashamed to give to us
that title? to us, who make war with such a spi∣rit
of lenity and mildness, that our only study is
to spare the blood, the effects and the honour of
our fellow-citizens? to us, who seek for nothing
but to free our country from the most iniquitous
of all captivities, and therefore well deserve the
title of saviours. And thanks to GOD the Giver
of all good, we have now obtained our purpose:
<PB N="263" REF="260"/>
for we have now formed a government sovereign,
free and independent, with the power of life and
death over so many thousand subjects, who ac∣knowledge
it, and obey it with fidelity and with
alacrity. We have now successively established a
rota and tribunals, judges and magistrates, admi∣nistratours
and executers of justice. We have se∣cretaries
offices, and publick archieves; open print∣ing-houses,
laws and statutes, troops and finances.
We have moreover under our dominion towers
and garrisons, castles and prisons, arms and can∣non,
harbours and shipping. Besides, we absolve
and condemn in the regular form of processes and
sentences; we impose taxes and contributions,
we adhibit our seals, we display our colours, we
declare wars, we form sieges, we capitulate for
truces and cessations of arms. Are not all these the
marks of sovereignty and dominion? How then
can they any longer call us a private band?”</P>

MANIFESTO
DEL GENERALE,
E SUPREMO CONSIGLIO DI STATO
DEL REGNO DI CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>LA giustizia della nostra guerra contro la repubblica di Genova
è tanto nota al mondo, quanto la necessità che ci ha indotti
a prender le armi per sottrarei dalla più obbrobriosa, ed insoffri∣bile
tirannia degl' ingiusti occupatori della nostra isola, e de ne∣mici
della nostra libertà. La moderazione, ciò non ostante,
colla quale ci siamo sempre diportati in questo sì giusto, e lode∣vole
impegno, avendo viepiù riempiti d' orgoglio, e fatti ogni
giorno più arditi a nostro danno i Signori di Genova, rende a
noi indispensabile il dovere nel punto che siamo per cambiar di
condotta a lor riguardo, manifestarne al pubblico li motivi, e le
ragioni, onde ognuno sia persuaso della rettitudine delle nostre
determinazioni, e di quella equità, che forma il carattere della
nostra nazione.</P>
<P>Da trenta anni che noi sosteniamo la presente guerra per isni∣dare
affato dalla nostra isola la repubblica di Genova, mai in al∣cun
modo avevamo tentato frastornare il commercio di mare a
sudditi di quella signoria, compassionando di quelli piuttosto l'in∣felice
situazione, che l'obligava a vivere sotto un governo, che
per la istessa sua costituzione non può se non esser tiranno. Ma
vedendo ora con quanta ostinazione, ed efficacia la predetta re∣pubblica
s'affatichi per interdire, e precludere ogni strada al com∣mercio
marittimo nel nostro regno, prendendo non solamente co'
suoi Bastimenti armati in Corso quelli che loro riesce incontrare
di nostra bandiera, ma per anche con felice ardimento finora ab∣brugiando,
ed insultando quelli delle altre nazioni più rispetta∣bili
dell' Europa, che per ragion di traffico si portino ad appro∣dare,
o partano da porti, e scali a noi soggetti della nostra isola.
E vedendo in fine, che questa nostra lenità, e contegno niente è
corrisposto dalli sudditi Genovesi, e che anche essi instigano il
<PB N="268" REF="263"/>
loro principe a privarci del beneficio del commercio con qualun∣que
bandiera, lusingandosi con questo mezzo vedere affatto la
nostra nazione soffrir nelle loro mani il monopolo delle sue so∣stanze,
colle quali si sono obbligati provedere quei presidi, che
noi teniamo bloccati. Per non mancar quindi di riguardo a noi
medesimi, per toglier gli ostacoli, e proteggere il nostro com∣mercio,
e per render sensibile il nostro risentimento a coloro,
che sul mare impunemente finora ci hanno insultati con tanto
nostro pregiudizio; prevalendoci del dritto, che ci compete, e
perchè è inseparabile da quella libertà, che il cielo ha concessa al
nostro valore, abbiamo deliberato conceder la facoltà a qua∣lunque
de' nostri nazionali, che volesse armar bastimenti da Corso
contro de Genovesi nostri nemici, e lor bandiera, d' inalberare il
nostro padiglione dopo aver preso però da noi il passaporto, e
le istruzioni opportune; la quale facoltà nell' istesso modo,
e forma, volentieri accorderemo ancora a qualunque straniere,
che volesse servirsene contro de' medesimi nostri nemici, e lor
bandiera, bonificandogli, ed assicurandogli tutti que' privilegi,
che in uguali circostanze sogliono accordarsi agli armatori.</P>
<P>Costretti per tanto da così pressanti motivi, e sode ragioni
a far la guerra anche per mare alla repubblica nostra nemica,
ci protestiamo nondimeno voler usare il maggior rispetto, ed i
riguardi possibili a tutti i prencipi dell' Europa, e di voler pra∣ticare,
ed osservare le leggi, e consuetudini introdotte, ed am∣messe
nelle guerre marittime anche verso de Genovesi, quando i
medesimi colle solite loro irregolari, ed inumane procedure non
ci costringano ad appartarcene.</P>

della paterna nostra amorevolezza, e del sincero desiderio
che abbiamo di renderli tranquilli e felici; essendoci fatte pre∣senti
le instanze di una gran parte de detti popoli, abbiamo

generale indulto di tutto ciò che può essere accaduto in occasione
de' moti trascorsi: gli accertiamo inoltre della immancabile
nostra disposizione ad assicurare la tranquillità, e la fecilità loro
col mezzo di tutte quelle graziose concessioni, che servano non
solo a confermare, e spiegare le precedenti, e particolarmente
quelle, che furono accordate in tempo dell' illustrissimo Pietro
Maria Giustiniano, ma ancora la ferma intenzione, in cui sia∣mo,
di concedere alla nazione Corsa distinzioni maggiori, sta∣bilire
una retta, ed invariabile amministrazione della giustizia
civile e criminale, favorire ed ampliare il commercio, e procu∣rare
in somma alla predetta nazione col bene della pace ogni
altro possibile vantaggio.</P>
<P>A questi giustissimi fini la prefata eccellentissima deputazione
impiegherà ogni sua cura e pensiero; ed invitiamo perciò non

<PB N="270" REF="265"/>
del regno a contribuirvi per parte loro con quella stessa
affezione, impegno, e buona fede, che per parte nostra, e dell'

procurando altresì il più pronto generale concorso di tutte le
pievi, e provincie, onde possa colla maggior sollecitudine, con∣cordia,
ed unanimità perfezionarsi un' opera, che dev' essere per
i suddetti nostri popoli di sommo interesse, ed importanza.</P>
<P>In vista di quanto sopra proibiamo espressamente a chi avrà
cara la nostra grazia il recare qualunque danno alle persone, e
bene di chiunque siasi de' suddetti nostri popoli; e siccome ci
promettiamo, che l'opera, e lo zelo di ognuno si adopereranno
efficacemente per un oggetto, che tanto interessa la repubblica,
e'l vero bene dei regno, così avremo noi presente il merito di
quelli, che con più di attività, e d'impegno contribuiranno a pro∣muoverlo,

RISULTATO DEL CONGRESSO TENUTO DA' CORSI IN
CASINCA, IN OCCASIONE DELLA GIUNTA SPEDITA
IN CORSICA DA' GENOVESI.
IL GENERALE,
ED IL SUPREMO CONSIGLIO DI STATO
DEL REGNO DI CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>LA repubblica di Genova conosciute insufficienti le proprie
sue forze, non che per sottometterci all' aborrito di lei do∣minio,
ma ben anche per far più lunga resistenza a quelle, che
ci fornisce la nostra unione, ed il nostro invincibile attacca∣mento
alla libertà da qualche tempo a questa parte, ma sempre
invano non ha mai cessato di tentare con tutta la maggior effi∣cacia
delle sue imposture d' indisporre contra di noi, e ricever
soccorso da qualche gran Corte d' Europa.</P>
<P>Vedendosi ora delusa in questo suo disegno, e sapendo benis∣simo
riputarsi da ogn' uno un dritto dell' umanità il dare una
volta quiete a questa nazione, fortemente ella teme, che nel
futuro congresso di pace considerata, e la giustizia della nostra
causa colle nostre solenni determinazioni, e l' incompatibilita
del suo governo col genio dei nostri popoli, i principi d' Eu∣ropa
per non lasciare accesa in seno all' Italia una scintilla di
guerra non pensino a farla desistere dalle pretensioni che ostenta,
e che ad altro fine non vorrebbe far valere sopra questo regno,
che per riempirlo di miserie, e d' orrore. In tale stato di cose
seguendo l' impulso della sua passione predominante di stragi, e
di vendette, ella ha creduto non potersi meglio opporre alle no∣stre
intraprese, che animando colla profusione di molto danaro,
e coll' offerta di gradi militari, e stipendi alcuni uomini vili, e
mercenari, esuli dalla lor patria per le enormità de' loro delitti,
ad introdurvisi surrettiziamente per eccitarvi il tumulto, e la dis∣unione;
<PB N="272" REF="267"/>
onde in apprensione, o distratti noi in una guerra ci∣vile,
avesse più commodo di far valere il giro de' suoi artisizi, e
nelle Corti, e nel congresso di pace. Ed ella tanto più volen∣tieri
ha adottato questo progetto, quanto che nel congresso di
Aquisgrana, allorchè i ministri delle potenze pensarono a met∣ter
le mani anche agli affari di Corsica, astutamente seppe elu∣derne
la premura coll' assertiva, che in poco tempo avrebb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
quietati i rumori di questo regno. Coll' istessa industria volen∣do
ora prevenire l' attenzione dei gabinetti per mezzo de' suoi
inviati, e con manifesti, impudentemente asserisce, e divulga, a∣vere
finalmente ritrovato il mezzo di ridurre alla quiete le cose
di Corsica, ed avere a tale oggetto sulle richieste della maggior
parte de' popoli, e de' principali della nazione destinata una giunta
di sei soggetti dell' ordine senatorio munita di ample facoltà, e
per attirarfi la confidenza, ed il concorso delle pievi nella città
di Bastia, e per ultimarvi il trattato di pacificazione.</P>
<P>Noi amatissimi compatriotti quali per raggione del nostro
ministero colla maggiore sollecitudine, ed indefessa attenzione
siamo continuamente applicati, e vegliamo alla conservazione
della vostra interna tranquillità, ed a sconcertare i progetti, e
respingere i tentativi de' nemici della nostra libertà, avendo
penetrato questo piano ed idea della repubblica di Genova, non
credemmo poter più lungamente differire la citazione del solito
annuale congresso, espediente sperimentato efficacissimo in tren∣ta,
e più anni di guerra per confondere l'orgoglio, e frastornar
le misure de' Genovesi. Fu intimato, e notificato <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tutti quel∣li,
che hanno voce, ed autorità su' i pubblici affari, e fu tenuto
col maggior concorso di tutti gli ordini, e rappresentanti della
nazione nel convento di S. Francesco della pieve di Casinca
nelle festività di pentecoste. Previddero il colpo fatale della
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or macchina i nostri nemici, e fecero ogni sforza per farlo ca∣dere
a vuoto. D. Filippo Grimaldi alla testa de' banditti, e
facinorosi fatti venire appostatamente da Genova in Bastia coll'
intelligenza del Martinetti, e coll' apparato di molti bastimenti
fece uno scalo in Fiumorbo, e stabilissi a casa di Sardo, da dove
com minaccie e lusinghe, e colla proposizione di levare un reggi∣mento
in quella commarca, si persuase spaventare i buoni patri∣otti,
e tirare a se il concorso di molti partiti nel disegno d'inter∣rompere,
occupandoci altrove, il citato congresso, e priva rci
così della congiuntura più propria d'illuminare i nostri popoli,
e d' essere assistiti dal loro zelo, e generosità nel commune bi∣sogno.
L'istantaneo provedimento, che s' oppose a questo pri∣mo
tentativo degli avversari, e la prontezza con cui prese l'ar∣mi
per difesa della propria libertà tutta quella comarca, vi so∣no
egualmente noti alla sconfitta de' traditori della patria, e
delle truppe Genovesi. Continuò dunque il congresso colla più
<PB N="273" REF="268"/>
desiderabile unanimità di sentimenti, e colla più matura ponde∣razione
delle cose le sue sessioni, nelle quali furono prese le qui
sotto notate deliberazioni, quali perche siano a notizia d' ogn'
uno, e per la loro intiera osservanza, vogliamo ed ordiniamo
che siano lette, e pubblicate, ed affissata copia ne' luoghi soliti,
e consueti, riserbandoci sopra aleuni punti ad emanar fuori più
circostanziato dettaglio per soddisfazione, ed intelligenza de'
nostri amatissimi popoli.</P>
<P>I. E' stato decretato clie si faccia un manifesto per mezzo di
cui sinentire quelli della repubblica di Genova, protestando nel
medesimo, che in alcun tempo mai noi non saremo per dare o∣recchio
a veruna proposizione d' accordo con i Genovesi, se que∣sti
per preliminari non riconoscono la nostra libertà, l'indipen∣denza
del nostro governo, e non cedono al medesimo le poche
piazze che ancor tengono nel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regno. Quali preliminari accor∣dati,
ed eseguiti, la nazione Corsa, ed il suo governo adotterà
le misure più proprie e decenti, e farà spiccare la natural sua e∣quità,
e moderazione per indennizare il decoro, e gl'interessi
della repubblica di Genova.</P>
<P>II. Nella più probabile supposizione, che i Genovesi accie∣cati
dal loro orgoglio non saranno per aderire a questi prelimi∣nari
di pace, per metterci maggiormente in istato di fargli con
più successo, e vigorosa la guerra in consegirenza del piano sta∣bilito
per l' anno corrente, è stato pensato, ed a pieni voti de∣terminato,
che si levi una contribuzione straordinaria, in virtù
della quale determinazione, cia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuno che avrà beni stabili, mo∣bili,
o semoventi fruttiferi nel regno dovrà pagare una lira per
ogni mille che ne possederà in detti effetti per una sol volta.
Per fare questa esigenza li signori intendenti generali, o altri
presidenti della camera con una particolare istruzione si mette∣ranno
in giro nel prossimo venturo mese d' Agosto.</P>
<P>III. Per la più pronta spedizione degli affari, e per essere nel
luogo il più a portata d' invigilare all' interna tranquillità del
regno è stato conchiuso, e stabilito, che il governo supremo
faccia fissa la sua residenza nella città di Corte, e che vi si deb∣ba
trasferire ne' primi giorni dell' entrante Giugno, col permesso
però al Sig. Generale di poterfene appartare quando lo giudi∣chi
a proposito, o per l' esecuzione del piano stubilito delle o∣perazioni
di guerra in quest' anno, o per mantenersi alla fronte
del nemico, ed opporsi alli di lui tentativi. Nel qual caso re∣steranno
a di lui carico, e di sua inspezione particolare il co∣mando,
e la direzione dell' armi, la guarnigione de' presidi,
torri, e postamenti, ed ogni altro affare appartente alla guer∣ra,
e nel restante delle pubbliclie incombenze procederà il su∣premo
consiglio colla solita sua suprema autorità.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="269"/>
IV. Inerendo al desiderio de' veri amatori della libertà,
quale in ogni cosa vorrebbero che avesse uguale influenza, ed
ardentemente sollecitano per l' abolimento di ogni qualunque
residuo dell' antica servitù: siccome ancora per averne quel
profitto che ne ritraggono gli altri stati, si è stabilito di far co∣niare
colle armi del regno una quantità proporzionata di mo∣neta
di rame, e d' argento, per servire agli usi correnti dentro
il regno. La quale moneta non potrà esser rifiutata da alcuno, e
nella quale solamente la camera, ed i tribunali riceveranno i pa∣gamenti,
i dazi, le tasse ordinarie, e straordinarie, condanne, ò al∣tro
&amp;c. Per maggior comodo de' popoli in ogni provincia, e forse
anche in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogni pieve sarà deputata una persona, a cui potrà rieor∣rere
chiunque per far qualche pagamento pubblico, per cui avrà
bisogno di cambiar moneta forastiera colla corrente del regno,
o di queste coila forastiera per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il commercio, ed usi fuori di
stato.</P>
<P>V. E per viepi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fare spiccare l'independenza dei nostri tribu∣nali,
e supplire in parte alle spese della loro manutenzione, è
stato risoluto, che il supremo governo pensi a far bollare colle
armi del regno una quantità di carta, consegnandola agl' inten∣denti
generali delle finanze, coll' incarico ai medesimi di distri∣buirne
per ciascuna pieve a proporzione, perchè venga comprata
a soldi due, e denari otto il foglio da chiunque ne avrà bisogno.
Poichè dal momento che sarà distribuita per le pievi, questa
carta così bollata, e sarà notificato a tutti per mezzo d'una cir∣colare,
non sarà ricevuto come istromento, ò scrittura pubblica,

atto in avvenire non scritto sopra questa carta.</P>
<P>VI. E ad oggetto di far più sensibile, e manifesto il giusto no∣stro
risentimento contro Don Filippo Grimaldi, capo e direttore
de' facinorosi felloni, ed emissari, le di cui malvagie inclinazioni
lo condussero al remo nella sua gioventù, ed a cui la frequenza
de' più enormi delitti contro la patria ha servito di scala per
arrivare al grado di colonnello della repubblica di Genova,
della quale or gode la maggior confidenza, si è ordinato, che
debba construirli la figura d'un uomo di paglia rappresentante esso
Don Filippo Grimaldi, per essere dal ministro di giustizia alle
forche piscaine publicamente impiccato, affinchè venendo in
qualunque tempo nelle nostre forze, si debba eseguire il mede∣simo
supplicio nella di lui propria persona.</P>
<P>VII. Ed attese le presenti emergenze, si è pensato incaricare
colle più efficaci premure i commissari, i capitani delle armi, ed
altri pubblici uffiziali della nazione d' arrestare, e consegnare
alla giustizia tutte le persone sospette, ò che terranno discorsi
sediziosi, siccome d' invigilare agli andamenti, e sorprendere gli
<PB N="275" REF="270"/>
emissari dei Genovesi nelle loro respettive pievi, e parrocchie,
alla qual premurosa disposizione contravenendo si eseguiranno
rigorosamente contro di loro le leggi stabilite nel congresso di
Santo Pietro.</P>
<P>VIII. Si sono prese inoltre le misure più proprie per mante∣nere
il buon ordine nell' amministrazione della giustizia, e nella
percezione, e maneggio del danaro pubblico, ciocchè noi scrupo∣losamente
adempiremo in quanto per ragion del nostro impiego
a noi spetta, ed assiduamente invigileremo, che gli altri ancora
eseguiscano colla maggior diligenza, ed esattezza le loro com∣missioni,
e incombenze.</P>
<P>Noi per ultimo, amatissimi compatriotti, non stimiamo nem∣meno
opportuno d' esortarvi ad unire alla nostra sollecitudine la
vostra costanza, mentre nell' ultimo memorabile congresso si
è troppo manifestamente contradistinto il vostro zelo per la
commune patria, e nel concorrere in tanto numero, e con tanto

MEMORIA
AI SOVRANI
DI EUROPA.</HEAD>
<P>NON dovrebbe certamente laguarsi la repubblica di Ge∣nova,
se dai Corsi non si è prestato orrecchio alle lusing∣hevoli,
e generiche espressioni d' assicurare la tranquillità, e la
felicità loro contenute nell' editto dei 9 Maggio, sparso artifi∣ciosamente
in più mani dai Corsi medesimi. Chiunque sia per
poco informato delle circostanze foriere di questo editto, sarà
astretto a confessare, che ò la repubblica non ebbe lumi baste∣voli
per ben intraprender l'impegno di piegar l'animo dei Corsi,
oppure che le di lei mire erano a tutt' altro dirette, che a ren∣derli
tranquilli e felici. Lo sbarco clandestino di diversi uo∣mini
facinorosi già sbanditi dalla Corsica; la sedizione interna
tentata in più parti del regno; l' aver obligati alcuni uffiziali
Corsi, che sono al soldo dei Genovesi, a girare per i luoghi,
affine di ammutinar gente; il non aver fatto il minimo capi∣tale
del regno, ma soltanto del popolo meno illuminato, sono
forse mezzi adattati per dar principio alla tranquillità, e felicità
dei Corsi, ovvero ad eccitare fra essi lo spargimento del sangue,
e tutto l' orrore di una guerra civile? Le massime presenti del∣la
repubblica niente dissimili sono da quelle che per l' avanti
hanno animato il di lei governo, reso tanto odioso ai Corsi,
quanto è stato il compatimento, con cui ogni sovrano ha ri∣guardato
le di loro vicende. Nè accade che più si pensi a ri∣sogettargli
una nazione, la quale siccome dalla republica rico∣nosce
l' avvilimento di tutto il regno, e l'abiezione de' popo∣li;
così eleggerà una morte generosa, piuttosto che sottoporre
di nuovo ill collo all' antica schiavitù.</P>
<P>Dalla violenza, e dalla forza che potesse accorrere in ajuto
della repubblica, potrebbe, non vi è dubbio, abbattersi il va∣lore
dei Corsi, ma non per tanto si otterrebbe dai Genovesi l'
intento, perchè il cuore di quegli non perderebbe perciò quella
connaturale libertà, con cui si nasce, ed in vece di scemarsi,
<PB N="277" REF="272"/>
maggiormente si aumenterebbe quella antipatia, che dividerà
per sempre le due nazioni. E non è da credersi, che verun sov∣rano
voglia continuamente tenere in Corsica un' armata in piedi
per sostenere i dritti di una repubblica, che eccetto l' invasione,
non ha titolo, che possa contrapporsi a quelli che vi hanno gli
altri potentati d' Europa. O sia l' impero per rapporto alla
Toscana, o sia la Francia a cui altre volte fu incorporata, o sia
la Spagna per i re d' Aragona, o sia la Santa Sede Apostolica
di cui fu tributaria.</P>
<P>Intanto però neppure è da porsi in dubbio che i re moderni,
ai troni de' quali già pervennero i giusti clamori dei Corsi, vo∣gliano
trasandare quel dritto d' umanità, che può istillare nei
di loro animi augusti il pensiero di dare una volta la quiete alla
Corsica, col lasciarle godere la sua libertà, per cui in ogni tem∣po
ha dimostrato tanto attaccamento, e per cui ha sostenuta
con tanta costanza una guerra così disastrosa, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mettendola sot∣to
la protezione di qualche principe, che la riguardi come fi∣glia,
e che invigli ed influisca colla minor gelosia degl' altri
stati nella constituzione del suo governo; oppure adattando
qualche altro spediente poco meno analogo alla naturale incli∣nazione
de' suoi popoli, e che coll' indennità de' loro privilegi,
meno anche s' opponga alle mire politiche, ed alle pretenzioni
delle potenze interessate.</P>

DETERMINAZIONI
PRESE NEL CONGRESSO
DI TUTTI I CAPI PRINCIPALI DEL REGNO
Tenuto in CORTE li 23. 24. e 25. di Ottobre
dell' Anno corrente 1764.</HEAD>
<P>ATTESE le continuate notizie, che si hanno da tutte le
parti, sembra, che non vi sia più luogo a dubitare dell'
imminente venuta in Corsica delle truppe Francesi, leggendosi
persino nelle pubbliche gazzette il minuto dettaglio del numeró
di esse truppe, de' luoghi che dovranno occupare in Corsica, del
tempo, che dovranno restarvi, ed alcuni altri articoli concer∣nenti
a questa spedizione. Quindi è che il governo si è creduto
nella indispensabile necessità di convocare un particolare con∣gresso
di tutti i soggetti, che hanno occupata la carica di con∣siglieri
di stato nel supremo governo, de' presidenti delle pro∣vincie,
de' commissari delle pievi, e di tutti gli altri capi prin∣cipali
del regno ad oggetto di consultare intorno alle determi∣nazioni
da prendersi in rapporto a questo incidente troppo in∣teressante
per la nazione.</P>
<P>E sebbene vi sia luogo a credere, che le intenzioni di S. Ma∣està
Christianissima non tendano con questa spedizione a fare
direttamente la guerra ad una nazione, che sempre si è fatta
preggio del più sincero offequioso attaccamento alla corona di
Francia, e per cui altre volte si meritò la speciale protezione de'
di lui gloriosi predecessori; essendo però destinate le truppe
Francesi a munire, e difendere i presidi, che ancora ritengono
in Corsica i Genovesi, non possono i Corsi risguardarle, che co∣me
una specie di truppe ausiliarie della repubblica, finchè spe∣cialmente
non vengano loro a notizia tutti gli articoli del trat∣tato
di fresco conchiuso colla stessa repubblica relativo a questa
spedizione.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="274"/>
Affine pertanto di usare di tutta la possible precauzione, e di
prendere le misure più convenevoli alla pubblica sicurezza, si
sono prese unanimemente alcune determinazioni contenute ne'
seguenti articoli.</P>
<P><HI>Primo.</HI> Si formerà una giunta di guerra composta di vari
soggetti di tutte le provincie, da nominarsi dal supremo gover∣no,
la quale sam incaricata d' invigilare per la esatta, e rigo∣rosa
osservanza dell' articolo 34. dell' ultima general consulta,
risguardante la proibizione di qualunque forta di commercio co'
presidi nemici, tanto in riguardo all' accesso dei nazionali ai
detti presidi, quanto de presidiani agli scali della nazione, ad
oggetto di garantire i popoli dalle angustie di una vicina care∣stia
consimile a quella dell' anno scorso, per mantenere, ed au∣mentare
il commercio introdotto negli scali della nazione, e
provvedere nel tempo stesso alla susistenza delle pubbliche fi∣nanze.
Dandosi perciò piena autorità a detta giunta di punire
irremissibilmente i delinquenti.</P>
<P><HI>Secondo.</HI> Quantunque possa credersi, che le truppe Francesi
destinate ora in Corsica non siano per intraprendere cosa alcuna
in pregiudizio dei diritti della nazione, e rinnovarvi alcuno degli
attentati altre volte commessi con manifesto abuso della confi∣denza,
e buona fede de' Corsi nella inaspettata sorpresa della
paludella, e di alziprato, e nella resa del Castello di Sansio∣renzo
in mano de' nemici; contuttociò per maggiormente ab∣bondare
in precauzioni, sarà loro onninamente vietato l' acces∣so
ai paesi sotto qualunque pretesto. Sarà perciò ispezione di S.
Ecc. il Sig. Generale di tener muniti i postamenti di frontiera,
anche per far valere la giuridizione, e il dominio della nazione
sopra i territori degli stessi presidi confiscati a favore della pub∣blica
camera, come è stato praticato <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inora. Potrà però il
supremo governo accordare il passaporto a qualche officiale
Francese, che lo chiedesse, con obbligo di manifestare nella pri∣ma
generale consulta da tenersi i motivi della richiesta, e della
concessione di tali passaporti, e di quanto si fosse trattato con
essi Francesi.</P>
<P><HI>Terzo.</HI> Precorrendo voce, che possa essere fatta qualche pro∣posizione
di pace, o di accomodamento col<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a repubblica, dovrà
questa assolutamente rigettarsi, se prima non siano accordati,
ed eseguiti i preliminari proposti nella generall consulta di Ca∣sinca
dell' anno 1761.</P>
<P><HI>Quarto.</HI> S'incarica S. Ecc. il Sig. Generale di fare a nome
della nazione una rispettosa, ed efficace rimostranza a sua Ma∣està
Christianissima in rapporto ai danni, che viene a risentire
la nazione suddetta per la missione in Corsica delle sue truppe
in un tempo, che profittando i Corsi della estrema debolezza
de' lor nemici, erano ful punto di espellerli intieramente dali'
<PB N="280" REF="275"/>
isola, restando percio preclusa loro la strada ad ulteriori pro∣gressi,
e vantaggiata al contrario la repubblica, che viene con
questo mezzo a rinfrancarsi delle gravissime spese, che era te∣nuta
fare in Corsica, e a mettersi così maggiormente in istato
di continuare la guerra contro la nazione. Metterà in vista nel
tempo ste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o a S. Maestà il grave torto fatto anni adietro alla
nazione colla resa in mano de' Genovesi della importante piazza
di Sanfiorenzo, consegnata dai Corsi alle sue truppe affine di
custodirla, chiedendo di tutto la convenevole indennizzazione.</P>
<P><HI>Quinto.</HI> E perchè questa rimostranza abbia maggiormente il
suo effetto, sarà pure incombenza di esso Sig. Generale d'indi∣rizzarsi
alle potenze protettrici, ed amiche della nazione, sup∣plicandole
a volerla coadiuvare colla loro mediazione presso sua
Maestà Christianissima, e a continuare alla nazioue stessa l' alto
loro Padrocinio per la conservazione de' suoi diritti, e preroga∣tive
di libertà, e indipendenza.</P>
<P><HI>Sesto.</HI> Essendo venuto a notizia del supremo governo, che
qualimque privato indifferentemente si faccia lecito di devastare
i pubblici boschi, erigendovi fabbriche a suo talento di qualun∣que
sorta di legnami, nell' avvenire si proibisce rigorosamente a
chinnque ogni nuova erezione di dette fabbriche, ed il taglio di
qualsivoglia sorta di alberi ne' boschi suddetti, se prima non ne
avrà ottenutà la licenza in iscritto da concedersi dal solo supre∣mo
governo.</P>

GENERALE,
E SUPREMO CONSIGLIO
DI STATO
DEL REGNO DI CORSICA,
AI NOSTRI DILETTI POPOLI.</HEAD>
<P>FRA le incessanti gravissime occupazioni, che seco porta il
governo de' popoli alla nostra cura commessi, una delle
principali nostre applicazioni maisempre è stata quella di pro∣curare
alla gioventù del nostro regno un pubblico comodo onde
poterla istruire negli studi delle scienze divine ed umane, ad
oggetto di renderla maggiormente utile al servizio di Dio, e
della patria.</P>
<P>Il governo Genovese tra le massime della barbara detestabil
politica con cui reggeva questi popoli, sopra ogni altra, si at∣tenne
invariabilmente a quella di mantenergli nell' incoltura, e
nella ignoranza; e per quanto fiorissero le scienze, e fossero in
pregio presso le vicine nazioni, ed anche alcuni de' nostri nazi∣onali
dalla generosità de' principi d' Italia fossero prescelti a
sostenere con alta riputazion di dottrina le cattedre più rag∣guardevoli
nelle università di Roma, di Pisa, e di Padova, noi
però eravamo miseramente costretti a vedere in Corsica i più
sublimi e perspicaci ingegni, che la natura ha dati in ogni tem∣po,
ed in gran numero nel nostro clima, ò a languire senza
cultura, e consumarsi nella oscurità, e nell' ozio, ò a procac∣ciar
con grave dispendio oltremare, e per le contrade d' Europa
quel comodo di coltivarsi che non era loro permesso di rinve∣nire
nella lor patria.</P>
<P>La Provvidenza però, che in tante maniere ha manifestati
sopra di noi i più sensibili contrassegni della sua protezione, ha
dissipata in gran parte quella nuvola di oscurità, che cotanto
<PB N="282" REF="277"/>
ingiuriosamente ci copriva, e noi siamo a portata di disingan∣nare
il mondo, che non era la Corsica quel barbaro paese, che
voleasi far credere da' Genovesi, nemico dei buoni studi, e delle
scienze.</P>
<P>L' oggetto pertanto di questo nostro editto è quello di far
noto ai nostri amatissimi popoli, che l' università degli studi
ideata da gran tempo, e frastornata fin quì dalle circostanze
inopportune dei tempi, si aprirà il giorno tre del prossimo fu∣turo
Gennajo in questa città di Corte, luogo prescelto nell' ul∣tima
general<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consulta dello scaduto Maggio, come il più como∣do
a tutta la nazione. Quest' opera tanto salutare, e general∣mente
bramata dai nostri popoli, non avrà per avventura nel
fuo cominciamento tutta quella perfezione, a cui (come tutte
le altre nostre cose, che nate da piccoli principii, perchè guidate
dal zelo e dalla giustizia, hanno avuti notabilissimi accrescimen∣ti)
potrà pervenire con qualche tratto di tempo, bastando ora a
noi, che vi siano le scuole più necessarie, e le più proporzionate
al presente bisogno de' nostri popoli.</P>
<P>A tale effetto abbiamo prescelti i più valenti ed accreditati
professori, che oltre l' essere benemeriti della nazione per molti
altri titoli, non per avidità di lucro, o per allettamenti di va∣nità,
ma portati da un puro e sincero zelo del pubblico bene,
impiegheranno ora di buon animo le loro studiose fatiche ad
istruire nella maniera più desiderabile la gioventù, insegnando
giornalmente nelle pubbliche scuole dell' università le seguenti
facoltà, e scienze.</P>
<P>I. La Teologia Scolastica Dommatica, ove i principii della
religione, e le dottrine della cattolica chiesa saranno spiegate
con brevità e sodezza, e il professore farà altresì una lezione fra
settimana di Storia Ecclesiastica.</P>
<P>II. La Teologia Morale, in cui si daranno i precetti, e le
regole più sicure della Cristiana morale, e in un giorno della
settimana si farà la conferenza di un Caso pratico relativamente
alle materie insegnate.</P>
<P>III. Le Istitute Civile e Canonica, ove si mostrerà l' origine
e il vero spirito delle leggi, per il miglior uso delle medesime.</P>
<P>IV. L' Etica, scienza utilissima per apprendere le regole del
buon custome, e la maniera di ben guidarsi nei differenti im∣pieghi
della società civile, e comprenderà altresì la cognizione
del Diritto della Natura, e delle Genti.</P>
<P>V. La Filosofia secondo i sistemi più plausibili dei moderni
filosofanti, e il professore darà altresì i principii della Mate∣matica.</P>
<P>VI. La Rettorica.</P>
<P>VII. Vi sarà inoltre il comodo di istrulrsi in lingua volgare
nella Pratica tanto Civile che Criminale.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="278"/>
Le ore per le differenti scuole saranno distribuite in maniera,
che chi vorrà potrà intervenire lo stesso giorno a diverse lezioni,
e sarà tale il metodo che terranno i professori nell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insegnare,
che basterà una mediocre cognizione della lingua Latina per l'
intelligenza delle materie, alle quali vorranno applicare.</P>
<P>Invitiamo pertanto tutti i giovani studiosi del nostro regno,
tanto ecclesiastici che secolari, a prosittare di una occasione sì
vantaggiosa, che loro presentiamo: e sopratutto vogliamo per∣suaderci,
che con più ardore, ed in maggior numero vorranno
concorrervi i giovani delle famiglie più ragguardevoli e facol∣tose,
alla coltura dei quali essendo principalmente dirette le no∣stre
sollecitudini, avremo cura speciale, che vi siano per loro
scuole proporzionate, ad oggetto di fornirli delle necessarie cog∣nizioni
per abilitarli alle pubbliche cariche di consiglieri di stato,
di presidenti, auditori, e consultori delle giurisdizioni e provin∣cie,
e agli altri ragguardevoli impieghi della nazione, ai quali
avendo essi speciale diritto di aspirare, devono mostrare nel
tempo stesso un maggiore impegno di contradistinguersi nella
coltura de' buoni studii, per rendersi atti a sostenerli con digni∣tà:
oltredichè ritrovandosi essi in vicinanza del supremo gover∣no,
e presso sua eccellenza il Sig. Generale saranno altresì a
portata di dar saggio del loro valore, e bravura in tutti gli incon∣tri,
che ne saranno loro presentati per servizio della loro patria.</P>
<P>Ed assine di maggiormente eccitare la loro emulazione, per
viepiù aumentare e proteggere i pubblici studii, e favorire chi
gli coltiva, seguendo in ciò la massima di tutti i saggi governi,
si prenderanno da noi le più efficaci misure perchè alle cariche
tanto civili che ecclesiastiche del nostro regno siano sempre pre∣feriti
quelli che avranno lodevolmente fatto, ò faranno attual∣mente
il corso dei loro studii in questa nostra università. E poi∣chè
siamo rimasti gravemente commossi in vedere ogni anno us∣cire
dal regno un numero troppo grande de' nostri ecclesiastici
per passare in Terraferma a titolo di farvi i loro studii, restando
ora evacuato questo pretesto, facciamo loro sapere, che in l' av∣venire
non si concederanno più passaporti per Terraferma.</P>
<P>Si daranno finalmente gli opportuni provvedimenti per age∣volare
ai giovani studenti tutti i maggiori comodi in questa cit∣tà,
ed il minor dispendio, che sia possibile tanto in riguardo agli
allogiamenti, che ai viveri, ed applicheremo a rintracciare i mez∣zi
più proprii, onde supplire in qualche parte alla sussistenza de∣gli
studenti più poveri.</P>
<P>E perchè questo nostro editto pervenga à notizia di tutti, vogli∣amo
che se ne trasmetta copia a tutti i Podestà maggiori del reg∣no,
ordinando loro di pubblicarlo, ed affiggerlo ne' luoghi soliti.</P>

<HEAD>THE
JOURNAL
OF A
TOUR
TO
CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING resolved to pass some years abroad,
for my instruction and entertainment, I
conceived a design of visiting the island of Cor∣sica.
I wished for something more than just the
common course of what is called the tour of Eu∣rope;
and Corsica occurred to me as a place
which no body else had seen, and where I should
find what was to be seen no where else, a people
actually fighting for liberty, and forming them∣selves
from a poor inconsiderable oppressed na∣tion,
into a flourishing and independent state.</P>
<P>When I got into Switzerland, I went to see
M. Rousseau. He was then living in romantick
retirement, from whence, perhaps, it had been
better for him never to have descended. While
he was at a distance, his singular eloquence filled
<PB N="288" REF="281"/>
our minds with high ideas of the wild philoso∣pher.
When he came into the walks of men,
we know alas! how much these ideas suffered.</P>
<P>He entertained me very courteously; for I
was recommended to him by my honoured friend
the Earl Marischal, with whom I had the happi∣ness
of travelling through a part of Germany.
I had heard that M. Rousseau had some corres∣pondence
with the Corsicans, and had been de∣sired
to assist them in forming their laws. I told
him my scheme of going to visit them, after I
had compleated my tour of Italy; and I insisted
that he should give me a letter of introduction.
He immediately agreed to do so, whenever I
should acquaint him of my time of going thi∣ther;
for he saw that my enthusiasm for the
brave islanders was as warm as his own.</P>
<P>I accordingly wrote to him from Rome, in
April 1765, that I had fixed the month of Sep∣tember
for my Corsican expedition, and therefore
begged of him to send me the letter of introduc∣tion,
which if he refused, I should certainly go
without it, and probably be hanged as a spy.
So let him answer for the consequences.</P>
<P>The wild philosopher was a man of his word;
and on my arrival at Florence in August, I re∣ceived
the following letter:</P>

that My Lord Marischal is one of the most zea∣lous

charms of sweet Siena detained me longer than
they should have done. I required the hardy air
of Corsica to brace me, after the delights of Tus∣cany.</P>
<P>I recollect with astonishment how little the real
state of Corsica was known, even by those who
had good access to know it. An officer of rank
in the British navy, who had been in several ports
of the island, told me that I run the risk of my
life in going among these barbarians; for, that
his surgeon's mate went ashore to take the diver∣sion
of shooting, and every moment was alarmed
by some of the natives, who started from the
bushes with loaded guns, and if he had not been
protected by Corsican guides, would have cer∣tainly
blown out his brains.</P>
<P>Nay at Leghorn, which is within a day's sailing
of Corsica, and has a constant intercourse with it,
<PB N="293" REF="286"/>
I found people who dissuaded me from going thi∣ther,
because it might be dangerous.</P>
<P>I was however under no apprehension in going to
Corsica, Count Rivarola the Sardinian consul, who
is himself a Corsican, assuring me that the island
was then in a very civilized state; and besides,
that in the rudest times no Corsican would ever
attack a stranger. The Count was so good as to
give me most obliging letters to many people
in the island. I had now been in several foreign
countries. I had found that I was able to accom∣modate
myself to my fellow-creatures of different
languages and sentiments. I did not fear that it
would be a difficult task for me to make myself
easy with the plain and generous Corsicans.</P>
<P>The only danger I saw was, that I might be
taken by some of the Barbary corsairs, and have
a tryal of slavery among the Turks at Algiers. I
spoke of it to commodore Harrison, who com∣manded
the British squadron in the Mediterra∣nean,
and was then lying with his ship the Centu∣rion,
in the bay of Leghorn. He assured me, that
if the Turks did take me, they should not keep
me long; but in order to prevent it, he was so
good as to grant me a very ample and particular
passport; and as it could be of no use if I did not
meet the corsairs, he said very pleasantly when he
<PB N="294" REF="287"/>
gave it me, “I hope, Sir, it shall be of no use
to you.”</P>
<P>Before I left Leghorn, I could observe, that
my tour was looked upon by the Italian politici∣ans
in a very serious light, as if truly I had a com∣mission
from my Court, to negotiate a treaty with
the Corsicans. The more I disclaimed any such
thing, the more they persevered in affirming it;
and I was considered as a very close young man.
I therefore just allowed them to make a minister
of me, till time should undeceive them.</P>
<P>I sailed from Leghorn in a Tuscan vessel,
which was going over to Capo Corso for wine.
I preferred this to a vessel going to Bastia, because
as I did not know how the French general was
affected towards the Corsicans, I was afraid that
he might not permit me to go forward to Paoli.
I therefore resolved to land on the territories of
the nation, and after I had been with the illus∣trious
Chief, to pay my respects to the French if
I should find it safe.</P>
<P>Though from Leghorn to Corsica, is usually
but one day's sailing, there was so dead a calm
that it took us two days. The first day was the
most tedious. However there were two or three
Corsicans aboard, and one of them played on the
citra, which amused me a good deal. At sun∣set
<PB N="295" REF="288"/>
all the people in the ship sung the Ave Maria,
with great devotion and some melody. It was
pleasing to enter into the spirit of their religion,
and hear them offering up their evening orisons.</P>
<P>The second day we became better acquainted,
and more lively and cheerful. The worthy Cor∣sicans
thought it was proper to give a moral
lesson to a young traveller just come from Italy.
They told me that in their country I should be
treated with the greatest hospitality; but if I at∣tempted
to debauch any of their women, I might
expect instant death.</P>
<P>I employed myself several hours in rowing,
which gave me great spirits. I relished fully my
approach to the island, which had acquired an un∣usual
grandeur in my imagination. As long as I
can remember any thing, I have heard of “The
malecontents of Corsica, with Paoli at their
head.” It was a curious thought that I was just
going to see them.</P>
<P>About seven o'clock at night, we landed safely
in the harbour of Centuri. I learnt that Signor
Giaccomini of this place, to whom I was recom∣mended
by Count Rivarola, was just dead. He
had made a handsome fortune in the East Indies;
and having had a remarkable warmth in the cause
of liberty during his whole life, he shewed it in
<PB N="296" REF="289"/>
the strongest manner in his last will. He bequeath∣ed
a considerable sum of money, and some pieces
of ordnance, to the nation. He also left it in
charge to his heir, to live in Corsica, and be firm
in the patriotick interest; and if ever the island
should again be reduced under the power of the
Genoese, he ordered him to retire with all his ef∣fects
to Leghorn. Upon these conditions only,
could his heir enjoy his estate.</P>
<P>I was directed to the house of Signor Giacco∣mini's
cousin, Signor Antonio Antonetti at Mor∣siglia,
about a mile up the country. The pros∣pect
of the mountains covered with vines and olives,
was extremely agreeable; and the odour of the
myrtle and other aromatick shrubs and flowers
that grew all around me, was very refreshing. As
I walked along, I often saw Corsican peasants
come suddenly out from the covert; and as they
were all armed, I saw how the frightened imagina∣tion
of the surgeon's mate had raised up so many
assassins. Even the man who carried my baggage
was armed, and had I been timorous might have
alarmed me. But he and I were very good com∣pany
to each other. As it grew dusky, I repeated
to myself these lines from a fine passage in Ari∣osto:</P>
<Q><PB N="297" REF="290"/>
<L>E pur per selve oscure e calli obliqui</L>
<L>Insieme van, senza sospetto aversi.</L>
<L>ARIOST. Canto 1.</L>
<L>Together through dark woods and winding ways</L>
<L>They walk, nor on their hearts suspicion preys.</L></Q>
<P>I delivered Signor Antonetti the letter for his
deceased cousin. He read it, and received me
with unaffected cordiality, making an apology for
my frugal entertainment, but assuring me of a
hearty welcome. His true kindly hospitality was
also shewn in taking care of my servant, an ho∣nest
Swiss, who loved to eat and drink well.</P>
<P>I had formed a strange notion that I should see
every thing in Corsica totally different from what I
had seen in any other country. I was therefore
much surprised to find Signor Antonetti's house
quite an Italian one, with very good furniture,
prints, and copies of some of the famous pictures.
In particular, I was struck to find here a small
copy from Raphael, of St. Michael and the Dra∣gon.
There was no necessity for its being well
done. To see the thing at all was what surprised
me.</P>
<P>Signor Antonetti gave me an excellent light re∣past,
and a very good bed. He spoke with great
strength of the patriotick cause, and with great
<PB N="298" REF="291"/>
veneration of the General. I was quite easy, and
liked much the opening of my Corsican tour.</P>
<P>The next day, being Sunday, it rained very
hard; and I must observe that the Corsicans with
all their resolution, are afraid of bad weather, to a
degree of effeminacy. I got indeed a droll
but a just enough account of this, from one of
them: “Sir, said he, if you were as poor as a
Corsican, and had but one coat, so as that after
being wet, you could not put on dry cloths,
you would be afraid too.” Signor Antonetti
would not allow me to set out while it rained, for,
said he, “Quando si trova fuori, patienza; ma
di andare fuori è cattivo. If a man finds him∣self
abroad, there is no help for it. But to go
deliberately out, is too much.”</P>
<P>When the day grew a little better, I accom∣panied
Signor Antonetti and his family, to hear
mass in the parish church, a very pretty little
building, about half a quarter of a mile off.</P>
<P>Signor Antonetti's parish priest was to preach
to us, at which I was much pleased, being very
curious to hear a Corsican sermon.</P>
<P>Our priest did very well. His text was in the
Psalms: “Descendunt ad infernum viventes.
They go down alive into the pit.”</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="292"/>
After endeavouring to move our passions with
a description of the horrours of hell, he told us,
“Saint Catharine of Siena wished to be laid on
the mouth of this dreadful pit, that she might
stop it up, so as no more unhappy souls should
fall into it. I confess, my brethren, I have
not the zeal of holy Saint Catharine. but I do
what I can; I warn you how to avoid it.” He
then gave us some good practical advice, and con∣cluded.</P>
<P>The weather being now cleared up, I took
leave of the worthy gentleman to whom I had been
a guest. He gave me a letter to Signor Damiano
Tomasi, Padre del Commune at Pino, the next
village. I got a man with an ass to carry my bag∣gage.
But such a road I never saw. It was ab∣solutely
scrambling along the face of a rock over∣hanging
the sea, upon a path sometimes not above
a foot broad. I thought the ass rather retarded
me; so I prevailed with the man, to take my
portmanteau and other things on his back.</P>
<P>Had I formed my opinion of Corsica from what
I saw this morning, I might have been in as bad
humour with it, as Seneca was, whose reflections
in prose are not inferiour to his epigrams: “Quid
tam nudum inveniri potest, quid tam abrup∣tum
undique quam hoc saxum? quid ad copi∣as,
<PB N="300" REF="293"/>
“respicienti jejunius? quid ad homines im∣mansuetius?
quid ad ipsum loci situm horri∣dius?
Plures tamen hîc peregrini quam cives
consistunt? usque eò ergo commutatio ipsa lo∣corum
gravis non est, ut hic quoque locus a
patria quosdam abduxerit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Seneca de Consolatione.</NOTE> What can be
found so bare, what so rugged all around as this
rock? what more barren of provisions? what
more rude as to its inhabitants? what in
the very situation of the place more horrible?
what in climte more intemperate? yet there are
more foreigners than natives here. So far then
is a change of place from being disagreeable,
that even this place hath brought some people
away from their country.”</P>
<P>At Pino I was surprised to find myself met by
some brisk young fellows drest like English sail∣ors,
and speaking English tolerably well. They
had been often with cargoes of wine at Leghorn,
where they had picked up what they knew of our
language, and taken clothes in part of payment
for some of their merchandise.</P>
<P>I was cordially entertained at Signor Tomasi's.
Throughout all Corsica, except in garrison towns,
there is hardly an inn. I met with a single one,
<PB N="301" REF="294"/>
about eight miles from Corte. Before I was ac∣customed
to the Corsican hospitality, I sometimes
forgot myself, and imagining I was in a publick
house, called for what I wanted, with the tone
which one uses in calling to the waiters at a ta∣vern.
I did so at Pino, asking for a variety of
things at once; when Signora Tomasi perceiving
my mistake, looked in my face and smiled, say∣ing
with much calmness and good nature, “Una
cosa dopo un altra, Signore. One thing after
another, Sir.”</P>
<P>In writing this Journal, I shall not tire my
readers, with relating the occurences of each par∣ticular
day. It will be much more agreeable to
them, to have a free and continued account of
what I saw or heard, most worthy of observa∣tion.</P>
<P>For some time, I had very curious travelling,
mostly on foot, and attended by a couple of
stout women, who carried my baggage upon
their heads. Every time that I prepared to set
out from a village, I could not help laughing, to
see the good people eager to have my equipage in
order, and roaring out, “Le Donne, Le Donne.
The Women, The Women.”</P>
<P>I had full leisure and the best opportunities to
observe every thing, in my progress through the
<PB N="302" REF="295"/>
island. I was lodged sometimes in private houses,
sometimes in convents, being always well recom∣mended
from place to place. The first convent
in which I lay, was at Canari. It appeared a
little odd at first. But I soon learnt to repair to
my dormitory as naturally as if I had been a friar
for seven years.</P>
<P>The convents were small decent buildings, suit∣ed
to the sober ideas of their pious inhabitants.
The religious who devoutly endeavour to “walk
with GOD,” are often treated with raillery, by
those whom pleasure or business prevents from
thinking of future and more exalted objects. A
little experience of the serenity and peace of mind
to be found in convents, would be of use to
temper the fire of men of the world.</P>
<P>At Patrimonio I found the seat of a provincial
magistracy. The chief judge was there, and en∣tained
me very well. Upon my arrival, the cap∣tain
of the guard came out, and demanded who
I was? I replied “Inglese, English.” He looked
at me seriously, and then said in a tone between
regret and upbraiding, “Inglese, c'erana<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i nostri
amici; ma non le sono più. The English; they
were once our friends; but they are so no
more.” I felt for my country, and was abashed
before this honest soldier.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="296"/>
At Oletta I visited Count Nicholas Rivarola,
brother to my friend at Leghorn. He received
me with great kindness, and did every thing in his
power to make me easy. I found here a Corsican
who thought better of the British, than the captain
of the guard at Patrimonio. He talked of our
bombarding San Fiorenzo, in favour of the pa∣triots,
and willingly gave me his horse for the af∣ternoon,
which he said he would not have done
to a man of any other nation.</P>
<P>When I came to Morato, I had the pleasure of
being made acquainted with Signor Barbaggi,
who is married to the niece of Paoli. I found
him to be a sensible intelligent well-bred man.
The mint of Corsica was in his house. I got spe∣cimens
of their different kinds of money in silver
and copper, and was told that they hoped in a
year or two to strike some gold coins. Signor
Barbaggi's house was repairing, so I was lodged
in the convent. But in the morning returned to
breakfast, and had chocolate; and at dinner we
had no less than twelve well-drest dishes, served on
Dresden china, with a desert, different sorts of
wine, and a liqueur, all the produce of Corsica.
Signor Barbaggi was frequently repeating to me,
that the Corsicans inhabited a rude uncultivated
country, and that they lived like Spartans. I
<PB N="304" REF="297"/>
begged leave to ask him in what country he could
could shew me greater luxury than I had seen
in his house; and I said I should certainly tell
wherever I went, what tables the Corsicans kept,
notwithstanding their pretensions to poverty and
temperance. A good deal of pleasantry passed
upon this. His lady was a genteel woman, and
appeared to be agreeable, though very reserved.</P>
<P>From Morato to Corte, I travelled through a
wild mountainous rocky country, diversified with
some large valleys. I got little beasts for me and
my servant, sometimes horses, but oftner mules
or asses. We had no bridles, but cords fixed
round their necks, with which we managed them
as well as we could.</P>
<P>At Corte I waited upon the supreme council,
to one of whom, Signor Boccociampe, I had
a letter from Signor Barbaggi. I was very politely
received, and was conducted to the Franciscan
convent, where I got the apartment of Paoli,
who was then some days journey beyond the
mountains, holding a court of syndicato at a vil∣lage
called Sollacaro.</P>
<P>As the General resided for some time in this
convent, the fathers made a better appearance
than any I saw in the island. I was principally
attended by the Priour, a resolute divine, who
<PB N="305" REF="298"/>
had formerly been in the army, and by Padre Giu∣lio,
a man of much address, who still favours
me with his correspondence.</P>
<P>These fathers have a good vineyard and an excel∣lent
garden. They have between 30 and 40 bee-hives
in long wooden cases or trunks of trees, with a co∣vering
of the bark of the cork tree. When they
want honey, they burn a little juniper-wood, the
smoak of which makes the bees retire. They then
take an iron instrument with a sharp-edged
crook at one end of it, and bring out the greatest
part of the honey-comb, leaving only a little for
the bees, who work the case full again. By tak∣ing
the honey in this way, they never kill a bee.
They seemed much at their ease, living in peace
and plenty. I often joked with them on the text
which is applied to their order: “Nihil habentes
et omnia possidentes, Having nothing, and yet
possessing all things.”</P>
<P>I went to the choir with them. The service was
conducted with propriety, and Padre Giulio play∣ed
on the organ. On the great altar of their church
is a tabernacle carved in wood by a Religious. It
is a piece of exquisite workmanship. A Genoese
gentleman offered to give them one in silver for
it; but they would not make the exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="299"/>
These fathers have no library worth mention∣ing;
but their convent is large and well built.
I looked about with great attention, to see if I
could find any inscriptions; but the only one I
found was upon a certain useful edifice:</P>
<Q><L>Sine necessitate huc non intrate,</L>
<L>Quia necessaria sumus.</L></Q>
<P>A studies, rhiming, Latin conceit marked upon
such a place was truly ludicrous.</P>
<P>I chose to stop a while at Corte, to repose my∣self
after my fatigues, and to see every thing a∣bout
the capital of Corsica.</P>
<P>The morning after my arrival here, three
French deserters desired to speak with me. The
foolish fellows had taken it into their heads, that
I was come to raise recruits for Scotland, and so
they begged to have the honour of going along
with me; I suppose with intention to have the
honour of running off from me, as they had done
from their own regiments.</P>
<P>I received many civilities at Corte from Signor
Boccociampe, and from Signor Massesi the Great
Chancellor, whose son Signor Luigi a young
gentleman of much vivacity, and natural polite∣ness,
was so good as to attend me constantly as
my conductour. I used to call him my gover∣nour.
<PB N="307" REF="300"/>
I liked him much, for as he had never been
out of the island, his ideas were entirely Corsican.</P>
<P>Such of the members of the supreme council
as were in residence during my stay at Corte, I
found to be solid and sagacious, men of penetra∣tion
and ability, well calculated to assist the Gene∣ral
in forming his political plans, and in turning
to the best advantage, the violence and enterprises
of the people.</P>
<P>The university was not then sitting, so I could
only see the rooms, which were shewn me by the
Abbé Valentini, procuratour of the university.
The professours were all absent except one Capu∣chin
father whom I visited at his convent. It is
a tolerable building, with a pretty large collection
of books. There is in the church here a taber∣nacle
carved in wood, in the manner of that at
the Franciscans, but much inferiour to it.</P>
<P>I went up to the castle of Corte. The com∣mandant
very civilly shewed me every part of it.
As I wished to see all things in Corsica, I desired
to see even the unhappy criminals. There were
then three in the castle; a man for the murder
of his wife; a married lady who had hired one of
her servants to strangle a woman of whom she
was jealous; and the servant who had actually
perpetrated this barbarous action. They were
<PB N="308" REF="301"/>
brought out from their cells, that I might talk
with them. The murderer of his wife had a
stupid hardened appearance, and told me he did it
at the instigation of the devil. The servant was
a poor despicable wretch. He had at first accused
his mistress, but was afterwards prevailed with to
deny his accusation, upon which he was put to
the torture, by having lighted matches held be∣tween
his fingers. This made him return to
what he had formerly said, so as to be a strong
evidence against his mistress. His hands were so
miserably scorched, that he was a piteous object.
I asked him why he had committed such a crime,
he said, “Perche era senza spirito, Because I
was without understanding.” The lady seemed of
a bold and resolute spirit. She spoke to me with
great firmness, and denied her guilt, saying with
a contemptuous smile, as she pointed to her ser∣vant,
“They can force that creature to say what
they please.”</P>
<P>The hangman of Corsica was a great curiosity.
Being held in the utmost detestation, he durst not
live like another inhabitant of the island. He
was obliged to take refuge in the castle, and there
he was kept in a little corner turret, where he had
just room for a miserable bed, and a little bit of
fire to dress such victuals for himself as were suf∣ficient
<PB N="309" REF="302"/>
to keep him alive; for nobody would have
any intercourse with him, but all turned their
backs upon him. I went up and looked at him.
And a more dirty rueful spectacle I never beheld.
He seemed sensible of his situation, and held down
his head like an abhorred outcast.</P>
<P>It was a long time before they could get a
hangman in Corsica, so that the punishment of
the gallows was hardly known, all their criminals
being shot. At last this creature whom I saw,
who is a Sicilian, came with a message to Paoli.
The General who has a wonderful talent, for phy∣siognomy,
on seeing the man, said immediately to
some of the people about him, “Ecco il boia,
Behold our hangman.” He gave orders to ask
the man if he would accept of the office, and his
answer was, “My grandfather was a hangman,
my father was a hangman. I have been a hang∣man
myself, and am willing to continue so.” He
was therefore immediately put into office, and the
ignominious death dispensed by his hands, hath
had more effect than twenty executions by fire
arms.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that no Corsican would upon
any account consent to be hangman. Not the
greatest criminals, who might have had their lives
upon that condition. Even the wretch, who for
<PB N="310" REF="303"/>
a paultry hire, had strangled a woman, would ra∣ther
submit to death, than do the same action, as
the executioner of the law.</P>
<P>When I had seen every thing about Corte, I
prepared for my journey over the mountains, that
I might be with Paoli. The night before I set
out, I recollected that I had forgotten to get a
passport, which, in the present situation of Corsi∣ca,
is still a necessary precaution. After supper
therefore the Priour walked with me to Corte, to
the house of the Great Chancellor, who ordered
the passport to be made out immediately, and
while his secretary was writing it, entertained me
by reading to me some of the minutes of the ge∣neral
consulta. When the passport was finished,
and ready to have the seal put to it, I was much
pleased with a beautiful, simple incident. The
Chancellor desired a little boy who was playing in
the room by us, to run to his mother, and bring
the great seal of the kingdom. I thought myself
sitting in the house of a Cincinnatus.</P>
<P>Next morning I set out in very good order,
having excellent mules, and active clever Corsican
guides. The worthy fathers of the convent who
treated me in the kindest manner while I was
their guest, would also give me some provisions
for my journey; so they put up a ground of their
<PB N="311" REF="304"/>
best wine, and some delicious pomegranates. My
Corsican guides appeared so hearty, that I often
got down and walked along with them, doing just
what I saw them do. When we grew hungry, we
threw stones among the thick branches of the
chestnut trees which overshadowed us, and in that
manner we brought down a shower of chestnuts
with which we filled our pockets, and went on
eating them with great relish; and when this
made us thirsty, we lay down by the side of the
first brook, put our mouths to the stream, and
drank sufficiently. It was just being for a little
while, one of the “prisca gens mortalium, the
primitive race of men,” who ran about in the
woods eating acorns and drinking water.</P>
<P>While I stopped to refresh my mules at a little
village, the inhabitants came crouding about me
as an ambassadour going to their General. When
they were informed of my country, a strong black
fellow among them said, “Inglese! sono barbari;
non credono in Dro grande. English! they are
barbarians; they don't believe in the great
GOD.” I told him, Excuse me, Sir. We do
believe in GOD, and in Jesus Christ too. “Um,
said he, e nel Papa? and in the Pope?” No.
“E perche? And why?” This was a puzzling
question in these circumstances; for there was a
<PB N="312" REF="305"/>
great audience to the controversy. I thought I
would try a method of my own, and very gravely
replied, “Perche siamo troppo lontani. Because
we are too far off.” A very new argument a∣gainst
the universal infallibility of the Pope. It
took however; for my opponent mused a while,
and then said, “Troppo lontani! La Sicilia è
tanto lontana che l'Inghilterra; e in Sicilia si
credono nel Papa. Too far off! Why Sicily is
as far off as England. Yet in Sicily they be∣lieve
in the Pope. O, said I, noi siamo dieci
volte più lontani che la Sicilia! We are ten
times farther off than Sicily. Aha!” said he;
and seemed quite satisfied. In this manner I got
off very well. I question much whether any of
the learned reasonings of our protestant divines
would have had so good an effect.</P>
<P>My journey over the mountains was very enter∣taining.
I past some immense ridges and vast
woods. I was in great health and spirits, and
fully able to enter into the ideas of the brave
rude men whom I found in all quarters.</P>
<P>At Bastelica where there is a stately spirited
race of people, I had a large company to attend
me in the convent. I liked to se their natural
frankness and ease; for why should men be afraid
of their own species? They just came in making
<PB N="313" REF="306"/>
an easy bow, placed themselves round the room
where I was sitting, rested themselves on their
muskets, and immediately entered into conversa∣tion
with me. They talked very feelingly of the
miseries that their country had endured, and
complained that they were still but in a state of
poverty. I happened at that time to have an
unusual flow of spirits; and as one who finds
himself amongst utter strangers in a distant coun∣try,
has no timidity, I harangued the men of
Bastelica with great fluency. I expatiated on the
bravery of the Corsicans, by which they had pur∣chased
liberty, the most valuable of all possessions,
and rendered themselves glorious over all Europe.
Their poverty, I told them, might be remedied by
a proper cultivation of their island, and by enga∣ging
a little in commerce. But I bid them re∣member,
that they were much happier in their
present state than in a state of refinement and vice;
and that therefore they should beware of luxury.</P>
<P>What I said had the good fortune to touch
them, and several of them repeated the same sen∣timents
much better than I could do. They all
expressed their strong attachment to Paoli, and
called out in one voice that they were all at his
command. I could with pleasure, have passed a
long time here.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="307"/>
At Ornano I saw the ruins of the seat where
the great Sampiero had his residence. They
were a pretty droll society of monks in the con∣vent
at Ornano. When I told them that I was
an Englishman, “Aye, aye, said one of them, as
was well observed by a reverend bishop, when
talking of your pretended reformation, Angli
olim angeli nunc diaboli. The English formerly
angels now devils.” I looked upon this as an
honest effusion of spiritual zeal. The fathers
took good care of me in temporals.</P>
<P>When I at last came within sight of Sollacarò,
where Paoli was, I could not help being under
considerable anxiety. My ideas of him had been
greatly heightened by the conversations I had held
with all sorts of people in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland, they having
represented him to me as something above hu∣manity.
I had the strongest desire to see so ex∣alted
a character; but I feared that I should be
unable to give a proper account why I had pre∣sumed
to trouble him with a visit, and that I
should sink to nothing before him. I almost
wished yet to go back without seeing him. These
workings of sensibility employed my mind till I
rode through the village, and came up to the
house where he was lodged.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="308"/>
Leaving my servant with my guides, I past
through the guards, and was met by some of the
General's people, who conducted me into an anti∣chamber,
where were several gentlemen in waiting.
Signor Boccociampe had notified my arrival, and
I was shewn into Paoli's room. I found him
alone, and was struck with his appearance. He
is tall, strong, and well made; of a fair complex∣ion,
a sensible, free, and open countenance, and a
manly, and noble carriage. He was then in his
fortieth year. He was drest in green and gold.
He used to wear the common Corsican habit, but
on the arrival of the French, he thought a little
external elegance might be of use, to make the
government appear in a more respectable light.</P>
<P>He asked me what were my commands for
him. I presented him a letter from count Riva∣rola,
and when he had read it, I shewed him my
letter from Rousseau. He was polite, but very
reserved. I had stood in the presence of many a
prince, but I never had such a trial as in the pre∣sence
of Paoli. I have already said, that he is a
great physiognomist. In consequnce of his be∣ing
in continual danger from treachery and assassi∣nation,
he has formed a habit of studiously ob∣serving
every new face. For ten minutes we
walked backwards and forwards through the
<PB N="316" REF="309"/>
room, hardly saying a word, while he looked at
me, with a stedfast, keen and penetrating eye, as
if he searched my very soul.</P>
<P>This interview was for a while very severe upon
me. I was much relieved when his reserve wore
off, and he began to speak more. I then ventur∣ed
to address him with this compliment to the
Corficans: “Sir, I am upon my travels, and
have lately visited Rome. I am come from
seeing the ruins of one brave and free people:
I now see the rise of another.”</P>
<P>He received my compliment very graciously;
but observed that the Corsicans had no chance of
being like the Romans, a great conquering nation,
who should extend its empire over half the globe.
Their situation, and the modern political systems,
rendered this impossible. But, said he, Corsica
may be a very happy country.</P>
<P>He expressed a high admiration of M. Rousseau,
whom Signor Buttafoco had invited to Corsica,
to aid the nation in forming its laws.</P>
<P>It seems M. de Voltaire had reported, in his ral∣lying
manner, that the invitation was merely a
trick which he had put upon Rousseau. Paoli
told me that when he understood this, he himself
wrote to Rousseau, enforcing the invitation. Of
this affair I shall give a full account in an after
part of my Journal.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="310"/>
Some of the nobles who attended him, came
into the room, and in a little we were told that
dinner was served up. The General did me the
honour to place me next him. He had a table
of fifteen or sixteen covers, having always a good
many of the principal men of the island with him.
He had an Italian cook who had been long in
France; but he chose to have a few plain sub∣stantial
dishes, avoiding every kind of luxury,
and drinking no foreign wine.</P>
<P>I felt myself under some constraint in such a
circle of heroes. The General talked a great deal
on history and on literature. I soon perceived
that he was a fine classical scholar, that his mind
was enriched with a variety of knowledge, and
that his conversation at meals was instructive and
entertaining. Before dinner he had spoken French.
He now spoke Italian, in which he is very elo∣quent.</P>
<P>We retired to another room to drink coffee.
My timidity wore off. I no longer anxiously
thought of myself; my whole attention was em∣ployed
in listening to the illustrious commander
of a nation.</P>
<P>He recommended me to the care of the Abbé
Rostini, who had lived many years in France.
Signor Colonna, the lord of the manor here, be∣ing
<PB N="318" REF="311"/>
from home, his house was assigned me to
live in. I was left by myself till near supper time,
when I returned to the General, whose conversa∣tion
improved upon me, as did the society of
those about him, with whom I gradually formed
an acquaintance.</P>
<P>Every day I felt myself happier. Particular
marks of attention were shewn me as a subject of
Great Britain, the report of which went over to
Italy, and confirmed the conjectures that I was
really an envoy. In the morning I had my cho∣colate
served up upon a silver salver adorned with
the arms of Corsica. I dined and supped constant∣ly
with the General. I was visited by all the no∣bility,
and whenever I chose to make a little tour,
I was attended by a party of guards. I begged
of the General not to treat me with so much ce∣remony;
but he insisted upon it.</P>
<P>One day when I rode out, I was mounted on
Paoli's own horse, with rich furniture of crimson
velvet, with broad gold lace, and had my guards
marching along with me. I allowed myself to
indulge a momentary pride in this parade, as I
was curious to experience what could really be
the pleasure of state and distinction with which
mankind are so strangely intoxicated.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="312"/>
When I returned to the continent after all this
greatness, I used to joke with my acquaintance,
and tell them that I could not bear to live with
them, for they did not treat me with a proper re∣spect.</P>
<P>My time passed here in the most agreeable man∣ner.
I enjoyed a sort of luxury of noble senti∣ment.
Paoli became more affable with me. I
made myself known to him. I forgot the great
distance between us, and had every day some hours
of private conversation with him.</P>
<P>From my first setting out on this tour, I wrote
down every night what I had observed during the
day, throwing together a great deal, that I might
afterwards make a selection at leisure.</P>
<P>Of these particulars, the most valuable to my
readers, as well as to myself, must surely be the
memoirs and remarkable saying of Paoli, which
I am proud to record.</P>
<P>Talking of the Corsican war, “Sir, said he, if
the event prove happy, we shall be called great
defenders of liberty. If the event shall prove un∣happy,
we shall be called unfortunate rebels.”</P>
<P>The French objected to him that the Corsican
nation had no regular troops. We would not
have them, said Paoli. We should then have the
bravery of this and the other regiment. At pre∣sent
every single man is as a regiment himself.
<PB N="320" REF="313"/>
Should the Corsicans be formed into regular troops,
we should lose that personal bravery which has
produced such actions among us, as in another
country would have rendered famous even a Ma∣rischal.</P>
<P>I asked him how he could possibly have a soul
so superiour to interest. “It is not superiour, said
he; my interest is to gain a name. I know well
that he who does good to his country will gain
that: and I expect it. Yet could I render this
people happy, I would be content to be forgot∣ten.
I have an unspeakable pride, “Una super∣bia
indicibile.” The approbation of my own
heart is enough.”</P>
<P>He said he would have great pleasure in seeing
the world, and enjoying the society of the learned
and the accomplished in every country. I asked
him how with these dispositions, he could bear to
be confined to an island yet in a rude uncivilized
state; and instead of participating Attick even∣ings,
“noctes coenaeque Deûm,” be in a conti∣nual
course of care and of danger. He replied
in one line of Virgil:
<Q><L>Vincet amor patriae laudumque immensa cupido.</L></Q>
<PB N="321" REF="314"/>
This uttered with the fine open Italian pronuci∣ation,
and the graceful dignity of his manner, was
very noble. I wished to have a statue of him
taken at that moment.</P>
<P>I asked him if he understood English. He im∣mediately
began and spoke it, which he did tole∣rably
well. When at Naples, he had known se∣veral
Irish gentlemen who were officers in that ser∣vice.
Having a great facility in acquiring lan∣guages,
he learnt English from them. But as he
had been now ten years without ever speaking it,
he spoke very slow. One could see that he was
possessed of the words, but for want of what I
may call mechanical practice, he had a difficulty
in expressing himself.</P>
<P>I was diverted with his English library. It con∣sisted
of</P>
<P>Some broken volumes of the Spectatour and
Tattler.</P>
<P>Pope's Essay on Man.</P>
<P>Gulliver's Travels.</P>
<P>A History of France, in old English.
And
Barclay's Apology for the Quakers.
I promised to send him some English books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have sent him the Works of Harrington, of Sidney, of Addison, of Trenchard, of Gordon, and of other writers in favour of liberty. I have also sent him some of our best books of morality and entertainment, in particular the Works of Mr. Samuel Johnson, with a compleat set of the Spectatour, Tattler and Guardian; and to the University of Corte, I have sent a few of the Greek and Roman Classicks, of the beautiful editions of the Messieurs Foults at Glasgow.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="315"/>
He convinced me how well he understood our
language; for I took the liberty to shew him a
Memorial which I had drawn up on the advan∣tages
to Great Britain from an alliance with Cor∣sica,
and he translated this memorial into Italian
with the greatest facility. He has since given me
more proofs of his knowledge of our tongue by his
answers to the letters which I have had the ho∣nour
to write to him in English, and in particular
by a very judicious and ingenious criticism on
some of Swift's works.</P>
<P>He was well acquainted with the history of
Britain. He had read many of the parliamentary
debates, and had even seen a number of the North
Briton. He shewed a considerable knowledge of
this country, and often introduced anecdotes and
drew comparisons and allusions from Britain.</P>
<P>He said his great object was to form the Corsi∣cans
in such a manner that they might have a firm
constitution, and might be able to subsist without
him. “Our state, said he, is young, and still re∣quires
the leading strings. I am desirous that the
<PB N="323" REF="316"/>
Corsicans should be taught to walk of themselves.
Therefore when they come to me to ask whom
they should choose for their Padre del Commune,
or other Magistrate, I tell them, You know bet∣ter
than I do, the able and honest men among
your neighbours. Consider the consequence of
your choice, not only to yourselves in particular,
but to the island in general. In this manner I ac∣custom
them to feel their own importance as
members of the state.”</P>
<P>After representing the severe and melancholy
state of oppression under which Corsica had so
long groaned, he said, “We are now to our coun∣try
like the prophet Elishah stretched over the
dead child of the Shunamite, eye to eye, nose to
nose, mouth to mouth. It begins to recover
warmth, and to revive. I hope it shall yet regain
full health and vigour.”</P>
<P>I said that things would make a rapid progress,
and that we should soon see all the arts and scien∣ces
flourish in Corsica. “Patience, Sir, said he. If
you saw a man who had fought a hard battle,
who was much wounded, who was beaten to the
ground, and who with difficulty could lift himself
up, it would not be reasonable to ask him to get
his hair well drest, and to put on embroidered
clothes. Corsica has fought a hard battle, has been”
<PB N="324" REF="317"/>
“much wounded, has been beaten to the ground,
and with difficulty can lift herself up. The arts
and sciences are like dress and ornament. You
cannot expect them from us for some time. But
come back twenty or thirty years hence, and we'll
shew you arts and science, and concerts and as∣semblies,
and fine ladies, and we'll make you fall
in love among us, Sir.”</P>
<P>He smiled a good deal, when I told him that
I was much surprised to find him so amiable, ac∣complished,
and polite; for although I knew I
was to see a great man, I expected to find a rude
character, an Attila king of the Goths, or a Luit∣prand
king of the Lombards.”</P>
<P>I observed that although he had often a placid
smile upon his countenance, he hardly ever laugh∣ed.
Whether loud laughter in general society
be a sign of weakness or rusticity, I cannot say;
but I have remarked that real great men, and
men of finished behaviour, seldom fall into it.</P>
<P>The variety, and I may say versatility, of the
mind of this great man is amazing. One day when
I came to pay my respects to him before dinner,
I found him in much agitation, with a circle of
his nobles around him, and a Corsican standing
before him like a criminal before his judge. Pa∣oli
immediately turned to me, “I am glad you”
<PB N="325" REF="318"/>
“are come, Sir. You protestants talk much against
our doctrine of transubstantiation. Behold here
the miracle of transubstantiation, a Corsican tran∣substantiated
into a Genoese. That unworthy
man who now stands before me is a Corsican, who
has been long a lieutenant under the Genoese, in
Capo Corso. Andrew Doria and all their greatest
heroes could not be more violent for the republick
than he has been, and all against his country.”
Then turning to the man, “Sir, said he, Corsica
makes it a rule to pardon the most unworthy of
her children, when they surrender themselves,
even when they are forced to do so, as is your
case. You have now escaped. But take care.
I shall have a strict eye upon you; and if ever
you make the least attempt to return to your trai∣terous
practices, you know I can be avenged of
you.” He spoke this with the fierceness of a lion,
and from the awful darkness of his brow, one
could see that his thoughts of vengeance were
terrible. Yet when it was over, he all at once re∣sumed
his usual appearance, called out “andiamo,
come along;” went to dinner, and was as cheerful
and gay as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>His notions of morality are high and refined,
such as become the Father of a nation. Were he
a libertine, his influence would soon vanish; for
<PB N="326" REF="319"/>
men will never trust the important concerns of
society to one they know will do what is hurtful
to society for his own pleasures. He told me that
his father had brought him up with great strict∣ness,
and that he had very seldom deviated from the
paths of virtue. That this was not from a defect
of feeling and passion, but that his mind being
filled with important objects, his passions were
employed in more noble pursuits than those of
licentious pleasure. I saw from Paoli's example
the great art of preserving young men of spirit
from the contagion of vice, in which there is often
a species of sentiment, ingenuity and enterprise
nearly allied to virtuous qualities.</P>
<P>Shew a young man that there is more real spi∣rit
in virtue than in vice, and you have a surer
hold of him, during his years of impetuousity and
passion, than by convincing his judgment of all
the rectitude of ethicks.</P>
<P>One day at dinner, he gave us the principal
arguments for the being and attributes of GOD.
To hear these arguments repeated with graceful
energy by the illustrious Paoli in the midst of his
heroick nobles, was admirable. I never felt my
mind more elevated.</P>
<P>I took occasion to mention the king of Prus∣sia's
infidel writings, and in particular his epistle
<PB N="327" REF="320"/>
to Marischal Keith. Paoli who often talks with
admiration of the greatness of that monarch, in∣stead
of uttering any direct censure of what he saw
to be wrong in so distinguished a hero, paused a
little, and then said with a grave and most expres∣sive
look, “C'est une belle consolation pour un
vieux general mourant,” “En peu de tems vous
ne serez plus.” It is fine consolation for an old
general when dying, “In a little while you shall
be no more.”</P>
<P>He observed that the Epicurean philosophy
had produced but one exalted character, whereas
Stoicism had been the seminary of great men.
What he now said put me in mind of these noble
lines of Lucan:</P>
<Q><L>Hi mores, haec duri immota Catonis</L>
<L>Secta fuit, servare modum finemque tenere,</L>
<L>Naturamque sequi, patriaeque impendere vitam,</L>
<L>Nec sibi sed toti genitom se credre mundo.</L>
<L>LUCAN. Pharsal. lib. ii. l. 380.</L></Q>
<Q><L>These were the stricter manners of the man,</L>
<L>And this the stubborn course in which they ran;</L>
<L>The golden mean unchanging to pursue,</L>
<L>Constant to keep the purpos'd end in view;</L>
<L>Religiously to follow nature's laws,</L>
<L>And die with pleasure in his country's cause,</L>
<L>To think he was not for himself design'd,</L>
<L>But born to be of use to all mankind.</L>
<L>ROWE.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="328" REF="321"/>
When he was asked if he would quit the island
of which he had undertaken the protection, sup∣posing
a foreign power should create him a Ma∣rischal,
and make him governour of a province;
he replied, “I hope they will believe I am more
honest, or more ambitious; for, said he, to ac∣cept
of the highest offices under a foreign power
would be to serve.”</P>
<P>“To have been a colonel, a general or a ma∣rischal,
said he, would have been sufficient for
my table, for my taste in dress, for the beauty
whom my rank would have entitled me to attend.
But it would not have been sufficient for this spi∣rit,
for this imagination.” Putting his hand upon
his bosom.</P>
<P>He reasoned one day in the midst of his nobles
whether the commander of a nation should be
married or not. “If he is married, said he, there is
a risk that he may be distracted by private affairs,
and swayed too much by a concern for his fami∣ly.
If he is unmarried, there is a risk that not
having the tender attachments of a wife and chil∣dren,
he may sacrifice all to his own ambition.”
When I said he ought to marry and have a son
to succeed him, “Sir, said, he, what security can I
have that my son will think and act as I do?”
<PB N="329" REF="322" MS="y"/>
“What sort of a son had Cicero, and what had
Marcus Aurelius?”</P>
<P>He said to me one day when we were alone,
“I never will marry. I have not the conjugal vir∣tues.
Nothing would tempt me to marry, but a
woman who should bring me an immense dowry,
with which I might assist my country.”</P>
<P>But he spoke much in praise of marriage, as
an institution which the experience of ages had
found to be the best calculated for the happiness
of individuals, and for the good of society. Had
he been a private gentleman, he probably would
have married, and I am sure would have made as
good a husband and father as he does a supreme
magistrate and a general. But his arduous and cri∣tical
situation would not allow him to enjoy do∣mestic
felicity. He is wedded to his country,
and the Corsicans are his children.</P>
<P>He often talked to me of marriage, told me
licentious pleasures were delusive and transient,
that I should never be truly happy till I was mar∣ried,
and that he hoped to have a letter from me
soon after my return home, acquainting him that
I had followed his advice, and was convinced from
experience, that he was in the right. With such
an engaging condescention did this great man be∣have
<PB N="330" REF="323" MS="y"/>
to me. If I could but paint his manner, all
my readers would be charmed with him.</P>
<P>He has a mind fitted for philosophical specu∣lations
as well as for affairs of state. One evening
at supper, he entertained us for some time with
some curious reveries and conjectures as to the na∣ture
of the intelligence of beasts, with regard to
which, he observed human knowledge was as yet
very imperfect. He in particular seemed fond of
inquiring into the language of the brute creation.
He observed that beasts fully communicate their
ideas to each other, and that some of them, such
as dogs, can form several articulate sounds. In
different ages there have been people who pre∣tended
to understand the language of birds and
beasts. “Perhaps, said Paoli, in a thousand years
we may know this as well as we know things
which appeared much more difficult to be known.”
I have often since this conversation, indulged my∣self
in such reveries. If it were not liable to ridi∣cule,
I would say that an acquaintance with the
language of beasts would be a most agreeable ac∣quisition
to man, as it would enlarge the circle of
his social intercourse.</P>
<P>On my return to Britain, I was disappointed to
find nothing upon this subject in Doctour Grego∣ry's
Comparative View of the Sate and Faculties
<PB N="331" REF="324"/>
of Man with those of the Animal World, which
was then just published. My disappointment
however was in a good measure made up, by a
picture of society, drawn by that ingenious and
worthy authour, which may be well applied to the
Corsicans: “There is a certain period in the
progress of society in which mankind appear
to the greatest advantage. In this period, they
have the bodily powers, and all the animal
functions remaining in full vigour. They are
bold, active, steady, ardent in the love of li∣berty
and their native country. Their manners
are simple, their social affections warm, and
though they are greatly influenced by the ties of
blood, yet they are generous and hospitable to
strangers. Religion is universally regarded a∣mong
them, though disguised by a variety of
superstitions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Preface to Comparative View, p. 8.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Paoli was very desirous that I should study the
character of the Corsicans. “Go among them, said
he, the more you talk with them, you will do
me the greater pleasure, Forget the meanness of
their apparel. Hear their sentiments. You will
find honour, and sense and abilities among these
poor men.”</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="325" MS="y"/>
His heart grew big when he spoke of his coun∣trymen.
His own great qualities appeared to
unusual advantage, while he described the vittues
of those for whose happiness his whole life was
employed. “If, said he, I should lead into the
field an army of Corsicans against an army double
their number, let me speak a few words to the
Corsicans, to remind them of the honour of their
country and of their brave forefathers, I do not
say that they would conquer, but I am sure that
not a man of them would give way. The Corsi∣cans,
said he, have a steady resolution that would
amaze you. I wish you could see one of them die.
It is a proverb among the Genoese, “I Corsi me∣ritano
la furca e la sanno soffrire. The Corsicans
deserve the gallows, and they fear not to meet it.”
There is a real compliment to us in this saying.”</P>
<P>He told me, that in Corsica, criminals are put
to death four and twenty hours after sentence is
pronounced against them. “This, said he, may
not be over catholick, but it is humane.”</P>
<P>He went on and gave me several instances of
the Corsican spirit.</P>
<P>“A sergeant, said he, who fell in one of our
desperate actions, when just a dying, wrote to
me thus: “I salute you. Take care of my aged
<PB N="333" REF="326"/>
father. In two hours I shall be with the rest who
have bravely died for their country.”</P>
<P>“A Corsican gentleman who had been taken
prisoner by the Genoese, was thrown into a
dark dungeon, where he was chained to the
ground. While he was in this dismal situation,
the Genoese sent a message to him, that if he
would accept of a commission in their service, he
might have it. “No, said he.” Were I to ac∣cept
of your offer, it would be with a determin∣ed
purpose to take the first opportunity of re∣turning
to the service of my country. But I
will not accept of it. For I would not have my
countrymen even suspect that I could be one
moment unfaithful.” And he remained in his
dungeon.” Paoli went on: “I defy Rome, Spar∣ta
or Thebes to shew me thirty years of such pa∣triotism
as Corsica can boast. Though the affec∣tion
between relations is exceedingly strong in the
Corsicans, they will give up their nearest relations
for the good of their country, and sacrifice such
as have deserted to the Genoese.”</P>
<P>He gave me a noble instance of a Corsican's
feeling and greatness of mind: “A criminal, said
he, was condemned to die. His nephew came
to me with a lady of distinction, that she might
solicit his pardon. The nephew's anxiety made
<PB N="334" REF="327" MS="y"/>
him think that the lady did not speak with suf∣ficient
force and earnestness. He therefore ad∣vanced,
and addressed himself to me: “Sir, is it
proper for me to speak?” as if he felt that it was
unlawful to make such an application. I bid him
go on. “Sir, said he, with the deepest concern,
may I beg the life of my uncle? If it is grant∣ed,
his relations will make a gift to the state of
a thousand zechins. We will furnish fifty sol∣diers
in pay during the siege of Furiani. We
will agree that my uncle shall be banished, and
will engage that he shall never return to the
island.” I knew the nephew to be a man of
worth, and I answered him. You are acquainted
with the circumstances of this case. Such is my
confidence in you, that if you will say that giving
your uncle a pardon would be just, useful or ho∣nourable
for Corsica, I promise you it shall be
granted. He turned about, burst into tears, and
left me, saying, “Non vorei vendere l'onore del∣la
patria per mille zechini. I would not have
the honour of our country sold for a thousand
zechins.” And his uncle suffered.”</P>
<P>Although the General was one of the constituent
members of the court of syndicato, he seldom
took his chair. He remained in his own apart∣ment;
and if any of those whose suits were
<PB N="335" REF="328"/>
determined by the syndicato were not pleased
with the sentence, they had an audience of Paoli,
who never failed to convince them that jus∣tice
had been done them. This appeared to me
a necessary indulgence in the infancy of govern∣ment.
The Corsicans having been so long in
a state of anarchy, could not all at once submit
their minds to the regular authority of justice.
They would submit implicitly to Paoli, because
they love and venerate him. But such a sub∣mission
is in reality being governed by their pas∣sions.
They submit to one for whom they have
a personal regard. They cannot be said to be
perfectly civilized till they submit to the determi∣nations
of their magistrates as officers of the state,
entrusted with the administration of justice. By
convincing them that the magistrates judge with
abilities and uprightness, Paoli accustoms the
Corsicans to have that salutary confidence in their
rulers, which is necessary for securing respect and
stability to the government.</P>
<P>After having said much in praise of the Corsi∣cans,
“Come, said he, you shall have a proof of
what I tell you. There is a crowd in the next
room, waiting for admittance to me. I will call
in the first I see, and you shall hear him.” He
who chanced to present himself, was a venerable
<PB N="336" REF="329" MS="y"/>
old man. The General shook him by the hand,
and bid him good day, with an easy kindness that
gave the aged peasant full encouragement to talk
to his Excellency with freedom. Paoli bid him
not mind me, but say on. The old man then
told him that there had been an unlucky tumult
in the village where he lived, and that two of his
sons were killed. That looking upon this as a
heavy misfortune, but without malice on the part
of those who deprived him of his sons, he was
willing to have allowed it to pass without inquiry.
But his wife anxious for revenge, had made an
application to have them apprehended and pu∣nished.
That he gave his Excellency this trouble
to intreat that the greatest care might be taken,
lest in the heat of enmity among his neighbours,
any body should be punished as guilty of the
blood of his sons, who was really innocent of it.
There was something so generous in this senti∣ment,
while at the same time the old man seemed
full of grief for the loss of his children, that it
touched my heart in the most sensible manner.
Paoli looked at me with complacency and a kind
of amiable triumph on the behaviour of the old
man, who had a flow of words and a vivacity of
gesture which fully justified what Petrus Cyrnaeus
hath said of the Corsican eloquence: “Diceres”
<PB N="337" REF="330" MS="y"/>
“omnes esse bonos causidicos. You would say
they are all good pleaders.”</P>
<P>I found Paoli had reason to wish that I should
talk much with his countrymen, as it gave me a
higher opinion both of him and of them. Thua∣nus
has justly said, “Sunt mobilia Corsorum in∣genia.
The dispositions of the Corsicans are
changeable.” Yet after ten years, their attach∣ment
to Paoli is as strong as at the first. Nay,
they have an enthusiastick admiration of him.
“Questo grand” uomo mandato per DIO a liberare
la patria, This great man whom GOD hath
sent to free our country,” was the manner in
which they expressed themselves to me concerning
him.</P>
<P>Those who attended on Paoli were all men of
sense and abilities in their different departments.
Some of them had been in foreign service. One
of them, Signor Suzzoni, had been long in Ger∣many.
He spoke German to me, and recalled
to my mind, the happy days which I have past
among that plain, honest, brave people, who of
all nations in the world, receive strangers with
the greatest cordiality. Signor Gian Quilico Casa
Bianca, of the most ancient Corsican nobility, was
much my friend. He instructed me fully with
regard to the Corsican government. He had
<PB N="338" REF="331"/>
even the patience to sit by me while I wrote
down an account of it, which from conversations
with Paoli, I afterwards enlarged and improved.
I received many civilities from the Abbé Rostini,
a man of literature, and distinguished no less for
the excellency of his heart. His saying of Paoli
deserves to be remembered: “Nous ne craig∣nons
pas que notre General nous trompe ni qu'il
se laisse tromper, We are not afraid that our
General will deceive us, nor that he will let
himself be deceived.”</P>
<P>I also received civilities from Father Guelfucci
of the order of Servites, a man whose talents and
virtues, united with a singular decency and sweet∣ness
of manners, have raised him to the honour∣able
station of secretary to the General. Indeed
all the gentlemen here behaved to me in the most
obliging manner. We walked, rode, and went
a shooting together.</P>
<P>The peasants and soldiers were all frank, open,
lively and bold, with a certain roughness of man∣ner
which agrees well with their character, and is
far from being displeasing. The General gave
me an admirable instance of their plain and natu∣ral,
solid good sense. A young French Marquis,
very rich and very vain, came over to Corsica.
He had a sovereign contempt for the barbarous
<PB N="339" REF="332"/>
inhabitants, and strutted about (andava a passo
misurato) with prodigious airs of consequence.
The Corsicans beheld him with a smile of ridi∣cule,
and said, “Let him alone, he is young.”</P>
<P>The Corsican peasants and soldiers are very
fond of baiting cattle with the large mountain
dogs. This keeps up a ferocity among them
which totally extinguishes fear. I have seen a
Corsican in the very heat of a baiting, run in,
drive off the dogs, seize the half-frantick animal
by the horns, and lead it away. The common
people did not seem much given to diversions.
I observed some of them in the great hall of the
house of Colonna where I was lodged, amusing
themselves with playing at a sort of draughts in
a very curious manner. They drew upon the
floor with chalk, a sufficient number of squares,
chalking one all over, and leaving one open, alter∣nately;
and instead of black men and white,
they had bits of stone and bits of wood. It was
an admirable burlesque on gaming.</P>
<P>The chief satisfaction of these islanders when
not engaged in war or in hunting, seemed to be
that of lying at their ease in the open air, recount∣ing
tales of the bravery of their countrymen, and
singing songs in honour of the Corsicans, and a∣gainst
the Genoese. Even in the night they will
<PB N="340" REF="333"/>
continue this pastime in the open air, unless rain
forces them to retire into their houses.</P>
<P>The ambasciadore Inglese, The English am∣bassadour,
as the good peasants and soldiers used
to call me, became a great favourite among them.
I got a Corsican dress made, in which I walked
about with an air of true satisfaction. The Ge∣neral
did me the honour to present me with his
own pistols, made in the island, all of Corsican
wood and iron, and of excellent workmanship.
I had every other accoutrement. I even got one
of the shells which had often sounded the alarm
to liberty. I preserve them all with great care.</P>
<P>The Corsican peasants and soldiers were quite
free and easy with me. Numbers of them used
to come and see me of a morning, and just go out
and in as they pleased. I did every thing in my
power to make them fond of the British, and bid
them hope for an alliance with us. They asked me
a thousand questions about my country, all which
I cheerfully answered as well as I could.</P>
<P>One day they would needs hear me play upon
my German flute. To have told my honest natu∣ral
visitants, Really gentlemen I play very ill,
and put on such airs as we do in our genteel com∣panies,
would have been highly ridiculous. I
therefore immediately complied with their request.
I gave them one or two Italian airs, and then
<PB N="341" REF="334"/>
some of our beautiful old Scots tunes, Gilderoy,
the Lass of Patie's Mill, Corn riggs are Bonny.
The pathetick simplicity and pastoral gaiety of
the Scots musick, will always please those who
have the genuine feelings of nature. The Corsi∣cans
were charmed with the specimens I gave them,
though I may now say that they were very indif∣ferently
performed.</P>
<P>My good friends insisted also to have an En∣glish
song from me. I endeavoured to please
them in this too, and was very lucky in that
which occurred to me. I sung them “Hearts of
oak are our ships, Hearts of oak are our men.”
I translated it into Italian for them, and never did
I see men so delighted with a song as the Corsi∣cans
were with the Hearts of oak. “Cuore di
quercia, cried they, bravo Inglese.” It was
quite a joyous riot. I fancied myself to be a re∣cruiting
sea officer. I fancied all my chorus of
Corsicans aboard the British fleet.</P>
<P>Paoli talked very highly on preserving the in∣dependency
of Corsica. “We may, said he, have
foreign powers for our friends; but they must be
Amici fuori di casa, Friends at arm's length.
We may make an alliance, but we will not sub∣mit
ourselves to the dominion of the greatest na∣tion
in Europe, This people who have done so
<PB N="342" REF="335" MS="y"/>
much for liberty, would be hewn in pieces man
by man, rather than allow Corsica to be sunk into
the territories of another country. Some years
ago, when a false rumour was spread that I had a
design to yield up Corsica to the Emperour, a
Corsican came to me, and addressed me in great
agitation: “What! shall the blood of so many
heroes, who have sacrificed their lives for the
freedom of Corsica, serve only to tinge the pur∣ple
of a foreign prince!”</P>
<P>I mentioned to him the scheme of an alliance
between Great Britain and Corsica. Paoli with
politeness and dignity waved the subject, by say∣ing,
“The less assistance we have from allies, the
greater our glory.” He seemed hurt by our treat∣ment
of his country. He mentioned the severe
proclamation at the last peace, in which the brave
islanders were called the Rebels of Corsica. He
said with a conscious pride and proper feeling,
“Rebels! I did not expect that from Great Britain.”</P>
<P>He however shewed his great respect for the
British nation, and I could see he wished much
to be in friendship with us. When I asked him
what I could possibly do in return for all his
goodness to me, he replied, “Solamente disin∣gannate
il suo corte, Only undeceive your court.
Tell them what you have seen here. They will
<PB N="343" REF="336"/>
be curious to ask you. A man come from Cor∣sica
will be like a man come from the Antipodes.”</P>
<P>I expressed such hopes as a man of sensibility
would in my situation naturally form. He saw at
least one Briton devoted to his cause. I threw
out many flattering ideas of future political events,
imaged the British and the Corsicans strictly unit∣ed
both in commerce and in war, and described
the blunt kindness and admiration with which the
hearty, generous common people of England
would treat the brave Corsicans.</P>
<P>I insensibly got the better of his reserve upon
this head. My flow of gay ideas relaxed his seve∣rity,
and brightened up his humour. “Do you re∣member,
said he, the little people in Asia who
were in danger of being oppressed by the great
king of Assyria, till they addressed themselves to
the Romans: and the Romans, with the noble
spirit of a great and free nation, stood forth, and
would not suffer the great king to destroy the little
people, but made an alliance with them?”</P>
<P>He made no observations upon this beautiful
piece of history. It was easy to see his allusion to
his own nation and ours.</P>
<P>When the General related this piece of histo∣ry
to me, I was negligent enough not to ask him
what little people he meant. As the story made
<PB N="344" REF="337"/>
a strong impression upon me, upon my return to
Britain I searched a variety of books to try if I
could find it, but in vain. I therefore took the
liberty in one of my letters to Paoli, to beg he
would let me know it. He told me the little
people was the Jews, that the story was related
by several ancient authours, but that I would find
it told with most precision and energy in the
eighth chapter of the first book of the Macca∣bees.</P>
<P>The first book of the Maccabees, though not
received into the Protestant canon, is allowed by
all the learned to be an authentic history. I
have read Paoli's favourite story with much satis∣faction,
and, as in several circumstances, it very
well applies to Great Britain and Corsica, is told
with great eloquence, and furnishes a fine model
for an alliance, I shall make no apology for tran∣scribing
the most interesting verses.</P>
<P>“Now Judas had heard of the fame of the
Romans, that they were mighty and valiant
men, and such as would lovingly accept all
that joined themselves unto them, and make a
league of amity with all that came unto them.”</P>
<P>“And that they were men of great valour.
It was told him also of their wars and noble
acts which they had done amongst the Gala∣tians,”
<PB N="345" REF="338"/>
“and how they had conquered them, and
brought them under tribute.”</P>
<P>“And what they had done in the country of
Spain, for the winning of the mines of the sil∣ver
and gold which are there.”</P>
<P>“And that by their policy and patience they
had conquered all the place, though it were ve∣ry
far from them.”</P>
<P>“It was told him besides, how they destroyed
and brought under their dominion, all other
kingdoms and isles that at any time resisted
them.”</P>
<P>“But with their friends, and such as relied
upon them, they kept amity: and that they had
conquered kingdoms both far and near, inso∣much
as all that heard of their name were afraid
of them:”</P>
<P>“Also, that whom they would help to a king∣dom,
those reign; and whom again they
would, they displace: finally, that they were
greatly exalted:”</P>
<P>“Moreover, how they had made for themselves
a senate-house, wherein three hundred and twen∣ty
men sat in council daily, consulting alway for
the people, to the end that they might be well
ordered.”</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="339"/>
“In consideration of these things Judas chose
Eupolemus the son of John the son of Accos,
and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to
Rome, to make a league of amity and confe∣deracy
with them.”</P>
<P>“And to intreat them that they would take
the yoke from them, for they saw that the king∣dom
of the Grecians did oppress Israel with ser∣vitude.”</P>
<P>“They went therefore to Rome, which was a
very great journey, and came into the senate,
where they spake, and said,”</P>
<P>“Judas Maccabeus, with his brethren, and the
people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to
make a confederacy and peace with you, and
that we might be registered your confederates
and friends.”</P>
<P>“So that matter pleased the Romans well.”</P>
<P>“And this is the copy of the epistle which the
senate wrote back again, in tables of brass,
and sent to Jerusalem, that there they might
have by them a memorial of peace and confe∣deracy.”</P>
<P>“Good success be to the Romans, and to the
people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever.
The sword also, and enemy be far from them.”</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="340"/>
“If there come first any war upon the Ro∣mans,
or any of their confederates, throughout
all their dominions,”</P>
<P>The people of the Jews shall help them, as
the time shall be appointed, with all their heart.”</P>
<P>“Neither shall they give any thing unto them
that make war upon them, or aid them with
victuals, weapons, money or ships, as it hath
seemed good unto the Romans, but they shall
keep their covenant, without taking any thing
therefore.”</P>
<P>“In the same manner also, if war come first
upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall
help them with all their heart, according as the
time shall be appointed them.”</P>
<P>“Neither shall victuals be given to them that
take part against them, or weapons, or money,
or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans;
but they shall keep their covenants; and that
without deceit.”</P>
<P>“According to these articles did the Ro∣mans
make a covenant with the people of the
Jews.”</P>
<P>“Howbeit, if hereafter the one party or the
other, shall think meet to add or diminish any
thing they may do it at their pleasures, and”
<PB N="348" REF="341"/>
“whatsoever they shall add or take away, shall
be ratified.”</P>
<P>“And, as touching the evils that Demetrius
doth to the Jews, we have written unto him,
saying, Wherefore hast thou made thy yoke
heavy upon our friends and confederates, the
Jews?”</P>
<P>“If therefore they complain any more against
thee, we will do them justice, and fight with
thee by sea and by land.”</P>
<P>I will venture to ask whether the Romans ap∣pear,
in any one instance of their history, more
truly great than they do here.</P>
<P>Paoli said, “If a man would preserve the ge∣nerous
glow of patriotism, he must not reason too
much. Mareschal Saxe reasoned; and carried
the arms of France into the heart of Germany,
his own country. I act from sentiment, not from
reasonings.”</P>
<P>“Virtuous sentiments and habits, said he, are
beyond philosophical reasonings, which are not so
strong, and are continually varying. If all the
professours in Europe were formed into one soci∣ety,
it would no doubt be a society very respect∣able,
and we should there be entertained with the”
<PB N="349" REF="342"/>
“best moral lessons. Yet I believe I should find
more real virtue in a society of good peasants in
some little village in the heart of your island. It
might be said of these two societies, as was said
of Demosthenes and Themistocles, “Illius dicta,
hujus facta magis valebant, The one was power∣ful
in words, but the other in deeds.”</P>
<P>This kind of conversation led me to tell him
how much I had suffered from anxious speculati∣ons.
With a mind naturally inclined to melan∣choly,
and a keen desire of enquiry, I had intense∣ly
applied myself to metaphysical researches, and
reasoned beyond my depth, on such subjects as it
is not given to man to know. I told him I had
rendered my mind a comera obscura, that in the
very heat of youth I felt the “non est tanti,” the
“omnia vanitas” of one who has exhausted all the
sweets of his being, and is weary with dull repeti∣tion.
I told him that I had almost become for
ever incapable of taking a part in active life.</P>
<P>“All this, said Paoli, is melancholy. I have
also studied metaphysicks. I know the arguments
for fate and free-will, for the materiality and im∣materiality
of the soul, and even the subtile ar∣guments
for and against the existence of matter.
Ma lasciamo queste dispute ai oziosi, But let us
leave these disputes to the idle. Io tengo sempre
<PB N="350" REF="343"/>
fermo un gran pensiero, I hold always firm one
great object. I never feel a moment of despon∣dency.”</P>
<P>The contemplation of such a character really
existing, was of more service to me than all I had
been able to draw from books, from conversati∣on,
or from the exertions of my own mind. I had
often enough formed the idea of a man continu∣ally
such, as I could conceive in my best moments.
But this idea appeared like the ideas we are taught
in the schools to form of things which may exist,
but do not; of seas of milk, and ships of amber.
But I saw my highest idea realized in Paoli. It
was impossible for me, speculate as I pleased, to
have a little opinion of human nature in him.</P>
<P>One morning I remember, I came in upon
him without ceremony, while he was dressing.
I was glad to have an opportunity of seeing him
in those teasing moments, when according to the
Duke de Rochefoucault, no man is a hero to his
valet de chambre. That lively nobleman who
has a malicious pleasure in endeavouring to divest
human nature of its dignity, by exhibiting parti∣al
views, and exaggerating faults, would have
owned that Paoli was every moment of his life a
hero.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="344"/>
Paoli told me that from his earliest years, he
had in view the important station which he now
holds; so that his sentiments must ever have been
great. I asked him how one of such elevated
thoughts could submit with any degree of pati∣ence,
to the unmeaning ceremonies and poor dis∣course
of genteel society, which he certainly was
obliged to do while an officer at Naples. “O, said
he, I managed it very easily. Ero connosciuto
per una testa singolare, I was known to be a sin∣gular
man. I talked and joked, and was merry;
but I never sat down to play; I went and came
as I pleased. The mirth I like is what is easy and
unaffected. Je ne puis souffrir long temps les di∣sieurs
de bons mots, I cannot endure long the
sayers of good things.”</P>
<P>How much superiour is this great man's idea
of agreeable conversation to that of professed
wits, who are continually straining for smart re∣marks,
and lively repartees. They put them∣selves
to much pain in order to please; and yet
please less than if they would just appear as they
naturally feel themselves. A company of pro∣fessed
wits has always appeared to me, like a
company of artificers employed in some very nice
and difficult work, which they are under a necessi∣ty
of performing.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="345"/>
Though calm and fully master of himself,
Paoli is animated with an extraordinary degree of
vivacity. Except when indisposed or greatly fa∣tigued,
he never sits down but at meals. He is
perpetually in motion, walking briskly backwards
and forwards. Mr. Samuel Johnson, whose com∣prehensive
and vigourous understanding, has by
long observation, attained to a perfect knowledge
of human nature, when treating of biography,
has this reflection: “There are many invisible cir∣cumstances
which, whether we read as inquiries
after natural or moral knowledge; whether
we intend to enlarge our science, or encrease our
virtue, are more important than publick occur∣rences,
Thus Sallusts the great master of nature,
has not forgotten in his account of Catiline, to
remark, that “his walk was now quick, and a∣gain
slow,” as an indication of a mind revolving
something with violent commotion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rambler, No. 60.</NOTE>.” Ever
mindful of the wisdom of the Rambler, I have
accustomed myself to mark the small peculiarities
of character. Paoli's being perpetually in moti∣tion,
nay his being so agitated that, as the same
Sallust also says of Catiline, “Neque vigiliis,
neque quietibus sedari poterat, He could not be
quieted either by watching or by repose,” are
<PB N="353" REF="346"/>
indications of his being as active and indefati∣gable
as Catiline, but from a very different cause:
The conspiratour from schemes of ruin and de∣struction
to Rome; the patriot from schemes of
liberty and felicity to Corsica.</P>
<P>Paoli told me that the vivacity of his mind
was such, that he could not study above ten mi∣nutes
at a time. “La testa mi rompa, My head
is like to break, said he. I can never write
my lively ideas with my own hand. In writing,
they escape from my mind. I call the Abbé
Guelfucci, Allons presto, pigliate li pensieri,
Come quickly, take my thoughts; and he writes
them.”</P>
<P>Paoli has a memory like that of Themistocles;
for I was assured that he knows the names of al∣most
all the people in the island, their characters,
and their connexions. His memory as a man of
learning, is no less uncommon. He has the best
part of the classicks by heart, and he has a happy
talent in applying them with propriety, which is
rarely to be found. This talent is not always
to be reckoned pedantry. The instances in which
Paoli is shewn to display it, are a proof to the
contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="347"/>
I have heard Paoli recount the revolutions of
one of the ancient states, with an energy and a
rapidity which shewed him to be master of the
subject, to be perfectly acquainted with every
spring and movement of the various events. I
have heard him give what the French call “Une
catalogue raisonnée” of the most distinguished men
in antiquity. His characters of them were con∣cise,
nervous and just. I regret that the fire with
which he spoke upon such occasions, so dazzled
me, that I could not recollect his sayings so as to
write them down when I retired from his pre∣sence.</P>
<P>He just lives in the times of antiquity. He
said to me, “A young man who would form his
mind to glory, must not read modern memoirs;
mà Plutarcho, mà Tito Livio; but Plutarch and
Titus Livius.”</P>
<P>I have seen him fall into a sort of reverie, and
break out into sallies of the grandest and noblest
enthusiasm. I recollect two instances of this.
“What a thought? that thousands owe their hap∣piness
to you!” And throwing himself into an
attitude, as if he saw the lofty mountain of fame
before him: “THERE is my object! (pointing to
the summit), if I fall, I fall at least THERE (point∣ing
a good way up), magnis tamen excidit ausis.”</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="348"/>
I ventured to reason like a libertine, that I
might be confirmed in virtuous principles by so
illustrious a Preceptour. I made light of moral
feelings. I argued that conscience was vague and
uncertain; that there was hardly any vice but
what men might be found who have been guilty
of it without remorse. “But, said he, there is no
man who has not a horrour at some vice. Dif∣ferent
vices and different virtues have the strong∣est
impression, on different men; Ma il virtù
in astratto è il nutrimento dei nostri cuori, But
virtue in the abstract, is the food of our hearts.”</P>
<P>Talking of Providence, he said to me with
that earnestness with which a man speaks who is
anxious to be believed: “I tell you on the word
of an honest man, it is impossible for me not to
be persuaded that GOD interposes to give freedom
to Corsica. A people oppressed like the Corsicans,
are certainly worthy of divine assistance. When
we were in the most desperate circumstances, I
never lost courage, trusting as I did in Providence.”
I ventured to object; But why has not Provi∣dence
interposed sooner? He replied with a noble,
serious and devout air, “Because his ways are un∣searchable.
I adore him for what he hath done.
I revere him in what he hath not done.”</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="349"/>
I gave Paoli the character of my revered
friend Mr. Samuel Johnson. I have often regret∣ed
that illustrious men, such as humanity produces
a few times in the revolution of many ages,
should not see each other; and when such arise
in the same age, though at the distance of half the
globe, I have been astonished how they could
forbear to meet.</P>
<P>“As steel sharpneth steel, so doth a man the
countenance of his friend,” says the wise mo∣narch.
What an idea may we not form of an
interview between such a scholar and philosopher
as Mr. Johnson, and such a legislatour and gene∣ral
as Paoli!</P>
<P>I repeated to Paoli several of Mr. Johnson's
sayings, so remarkable for strong sense and origi∣nal
humour. I now recollect these two.</P>
<P>When I told Mr. Johnson that a certain au∣thour
affected in conversation to maintain, that
there was no distinction between virtue and vice,
he said, “Why, Sir, if the fellow does not think
as he speaks, he is lying; and I see not what
honour he can propose to himself from having
the character of a lyar. But if he does really
think that there is no distinction between virtue
and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses

<P><PB N="357" REF="350"/>
Of modern infidels and innovatours, he said,
“Sir, these are all vain men, and will gratify
themselves at any expence. Truth will not af∣ford
sufficient food to their vanity; so they have
betaken themselves to errour. Truth, Sir, is
a cow which will yield such people no more
milk; and so they are gone to milk the bull.”</P>
<P>I felt an elation of mind to see Paoli delighted
with the sayings of Mr. Johnson, and to hear him
translate them with Italian energy to the Corsican
heroes.</P>
<P>I repeated Mr. Johnson's sayings as nearly as I
could, in his own peculiar forcible language, for
which, prejudiced or little criticks have taken
upon them to find fault with him. He is above
making any answer to them; but I have found a
sufficient answer in a general remark in one of his
excellent papers: “Difference of thoughts will
produce difference of language. He that thinks
with more extent than another, will want words
of larger meaning.”<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idler, No. 70.</NOTE></P>
<P>I hope to be pardoned for this digression,
wherein I pay a just tribute of veneration and
gratitude to one from whose writings and conver∣sation
I have received instructions of which I ex∣perience
the value in every scene of my life.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="351"/>
During Paoli's administration, there have been
few laws made in Corsica. He mentioned one
which he has found very efficacious in curbing
that vindictive spirit of the Corsicans, of which I
have said a good deal in a former part of this
work. There was among the Corsicans a most
dreadful species of revenge, called “Vendetta tras∣versa,
Collateral revenge,” which Petrus Cyrnaeus
candidly acknowledges. It was this: If a man
had received an injury, and could not find a pro∣per
opportunity to be revenged on his enemy
personally, he revenged himself on one of his ene∣my's
relations. So barbarous a practice, was the
source of innumerable assassinations. Paoli know∣ing
that the point of honour was every thing to
the Corsicans, opposed it to the progress of the
blackest of crimes, fortified by long habits. He
made a law, by which it was provided, that this
collateral revenge should not only be punished
with death, as ordinary murther, but the memory
of the offender should be disgraced for ever by a
pillar of infamy. He also had it enacted that
the same statute should extend to the violatours of
an oath of reconciliation, once made.</P>
<P>By thus combating a vice so destructive, he
has, by a kind of shock of opposite passions, re∣duced
the fiery Corsicans to a state of mildness,
<PB N="359" REF="352"/>
and he assured me that they were now all fully
sensible of the equity of that law.</P>
<P>While I was at Sollacarò, information was re∣ceived,
that the poor wretch who strangled the
woman at the instigation of his mistress, had con∣sented
to accept of his life, upon condition of
becoming hangman. This made a great noise
among the Corsicans, who were enraged at the
creature, and said their nation was now disgraced.
Paoli did not think so. He said to me, “I am
glad of this. It will be of service. It will con∣tribute
to form us to a just subordination. We
have as yet too great an equality among us. As
we must have Corsican taylours and Corsican shoe∣makers,
we must also have a Corsican hangman.”</P>
<P>I could not help being of a different opinion.
The occupations of a taylour and a shoemaker
though mean, are not odious. When I afterwards
met M. Rousseau in England, and made him a re∣port
of my Corsican expedition, he agreed with me
in thinking that it would be something noble for
the brave islanders, to be able to say that there
was not a Corsican but who would rather suffer
death, than become a hangman; and he also agreed
with me, that it might have a good effect to have
always a Genoese for the hangman of Corsica.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="353"/>
I must however do the Genoese the justice to
observe, that Paoli told me, that even one of them
had suffered death in Corsica, rather than consent to
become hangman. When I, from a keenness na∣tural
enough in a Briton born with an abhorrence
at tyranny, talked with violence against the Ge∣noese,
Paoli said with a moderation and candour
which ought to do him honour even with the re∣publick,
“It is true the Genoese are our enemies;
but let us not forget, that they are the descendants
of those worthies, who carried their arms beyond
the Hellespont.”</P>
<P>There is one circumstance in Paoli's character
which I present to my readers with caution, know∣ing
how much it may be ridiculed, in an age when
mankind are so fond of incredulity, that they seem
to pique themselves in contracting their circle of
belief as much as possible. But I consider this
infidel rage as but a temporary mode of the human
understanding, and am well persuaded that e'er
long we shall return to a more calm philosophy.</P>
<P>I own I cannot help thinking that though we
may boast some improvements in science, and in
short, superiour degrees of knowledge in things
where our faculties can fully reach, yet we should
not assume to ourselves sounder judgements than
those of our fathers; I will therefore venture to
<PB N="361" REF="354"/>
relate that Paoli has at times extraordinary im∣pressions
of distant and future events.</P>
<P>The way in which I discovered it, was this.
Being very desirous of studying so exalted a cha∣racter,
I so far presumed upon his goodness to me,
as to take the liberty of asking him a thousand
questions with regard to the most minute and pri∣vate
circumstances of his life. Having asked him
one day when some of his nobles were present, whe∣ther
a mind, so active as his, was not employed e∣ven
in sleep, and if he used to dream much. Signor
Casa Bianca said with an air and tone which im∣plied
something of importance, “Si, si sogna, Yes,
he dreams.” And upon my asking him to explain
his meaning, he told me that the General had often
seen in his dreams, what afterwards came to pass.
Paoli confirmed this by several instances. Said he,
“I can give you no clear explanation of it. I on∣ly
tell you facts. Sometimes I have been mistak∣en,
but in general, these visions have proved true.
I cannot say what may be the agency of invisible
spirits. They certainly must know more than
we do; and there is nothing absurd in supposing
that GOD should permit them to communicate
their knowledge to us.”</P>
<P>He went into a most curious and pleasing
disquisition, on a subject, which the late inge∣nious
<PB N="362" REF="355"/>
Mr. Baxter has treated in a very philoso∣phical
manner, in his Inquiry into the Nature of
the Human Soul; a book which may be read
with as much delight, and surely with more
advantage than the works of those who endea∣vour
to destroy our belief. Belief is favourable
to the human mind, were it for nothing else but
to furnish it entertainment. An infidel I should
think, must frequently suffer from ennui.</P>
<P>It was perhaps affectation in Socrates to say,
that all he had learned to know was that he
knew nothing. But surely it is a mark of wis∣dom,
to be sensible of the limited extent of hu∣man
knowledge, to examine with reverence the
ways of GOD, nor presumptuously reject any opi∣nion
which has been held by the judicious and
the learned, because it has been made a cloak for
artifice, or had a variety of fictions raised upon it,
by credulity.</P>
<P>Old Feltham says, “Every dream is not to be
counted of; nor yet are all to be cast away with
contempt. I would neither be a stoick, super∣stitious
in all; nor yet an epicure, considerate
of none<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feltham's Resolves, Cent. I. Resol. 52.</NOTE>.” And after observing how much
the ancients attended to the interpretation of
<PB N="363" REF="356"/>
dreams, he adds, “Were it not for the power
of the Gospel, in crying down the vains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He means vanity.</NOTE> of
men, it would appear a wonder how a science so
pleasing to humanity, should fall so quite to
ruin<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Feltham's Resolves, Cent. I. Resol. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mysterious circumstance in Paoli's cha∣racter
which I have ventured to relate, is univer∣sally
believed in Corsica. The inhabitants of that
island like the Italians, express themselves much
by signs. When I asked one of them, if there
had been many instances of the General's fore∣seeing
future events, he grasped a large bunch of
his hair, and replied, “Tante, Signore, So ma∣ny,
Sir.”</P>
<P>It may be said that the General has industri∣ously
propagated this opinion, in order that he
might have more authority in civilizing a rude
and ferocious people, as Lycurgus pretended to
have the sanction of the oracle at Delphos, as Nu∣ma
gave it out that he had frequent interviews
with the nymph Egeria, or as Marius persuaded
the Romans, that he received divine communica∣tions
from a hind. But I cannot allow myself to
suppose that Paoli ever required the aid of pious
frauds.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="357"/>
Paoli though never familiar, has the most per∣fect
ease of behaviour. This is a mark of a real
great character. The distance and reserve which
some of our modern nobility affect, is, because
nobility is now little else than a name in compa∣rison
of what it was in ancient times. In ancient
times, noblemen lived at their country seats, like
princes, in hospitable grandeur. They were men
of power, and every one of them could bring
hundreds of followers into the field. They were
then open and affable. Some of our modern no∣bility
are so anxious to preserve an appearance of
dignity which they are sensible cannot bear an
examination, that they are afraid to let you come
near them. Paoli is not so. Those about him
come into his apartment at all hours, wake him,
help him on with his clothes, are perfectly free
from restraint; yet they know their distance, and
awed by his real greatness, never lose their respect
for him.</P>
<P>Though thus easy of access, particular care is
taken against such attempts upon the life of the
illustrious Chief, as he has good reason to appre∣hend
from the Genoese, who have so often em∣ployed
assassination merely in a political view, and
who would gain so much by assassinating Paoli.
A certain number of soldiers are continually on
<PB N="365" REF="358"/>
guard upon him; and as still closer guards, he
has some faithful Corsican dogs. Of these five or
six sleep, some in his chamber, and some at the
outside of the chamber-door. He treats them with
great kindness, and they are strongly attached to
him. They are extremely sagacious, and know
all his friends and attendants. Were any person
to approach the General during the darkness of
the night, they would instantly tear him in pieces.
Having dogs for his attendants, is another cir∣cumstance
about Paoli similar to the heroes of
antiquity. Homer represents Telemachus so at∣tended:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>
<P>HOMER. Odyss. lib. ii. I. 11.</P>
<P>Two dogs a faithful guard attend behind.</P>
<P>POPE.</P>
<P>But the description given of the family of Patro∣clus
applies better to Paoli:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>
<P>HOMER. Iliad. lib. xxiii. I. 73.</P>
<P>nine large dogs domestick at his board.</P>
<P>POPE.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope in his notes on the second book of
the Odyssey, is much pleased with dogs being in∣troduced,
as it furnishes an agreeable instance of
<PB N="366" REF="359"/>
ancient simplicity. He observes that Virgil
thought this circumstance worthy of his imita∣tion,
in describing old Evander. So we read of
Syphax general of the Numidians, “Syphax inter
duos canes stans, Scipionem appellavit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mention this on the authority of an excellent scholar, and one of our best writers, Mr. Joseph Warton in his notes on the Aeneid; for I have not been able to find the passage in Livy which he quotes.</NOTE>, Syphax
standing between two dogs called to Scipio.”</P>
<P>Talking of courage, he made a very just dis∣tinction
between constitutional courage and cou∣rage
from reflection. “Sir Thomas More, said
he, would not probably have mounted a breach
so well as a sergeant who had never thought of
death. But a sergeant would not on a scaffold,
have shewn the calm resolution of Sir Thomas
More.”</P>
<P>On this subject he told me a very remarkable
anecdote, which happened during the last war in
Italy. At the siege of Tortona, the commander
of the army which lay before the town, ordered
Carew an Irish officer in the service of Naples,
to advance with a detachment to a particular post.
<PB N="367" REF="360"/>
Having given his orders, he whispered to Carew:
“Sir, I know you to be a gallant man. I have
therefore put you upon this duty. I tell you in
confidence, it is certain death for you all. I
place you there to make the enemy spring a
mine below you.” Carew made a bow to the
general, and led on his men in silence to the
dreadful post. He there stood with an undaunted
countenance, and having called to one of the sol∣diers
for a draught of wine, “Here, said he, I
drink to all those who bravely fall in battle.”
Fortunately at that instant Tortona capitulated,
and Carew escaped. But he had thus a full op∣portunity
of displaying a rare instance of deter∣mined
intrepidity. It is with pleasure that I re∣cord
an anecdote so much to the honour of a
gentleman of that nation, on which illiberal re∣flections
are too often thrown, by those of whom
it little deserves them. Whatever may be the
rough jokes of wealthy insolence, or the en∣vious
sarcasms of needy jealousy, the Irish have
ever been, and will continue to be, highly re∣garded
upon the continent.</P>
<P>Paoli's personal authority among the Corsi∣cans
struck me much. I have seen a crowd of
them with eagerness and impetuosity, endeavour∣ing
to approach him, as if they would have burst
into his appartment by force. In vain did the
<PB N="368" REF="361"/>
guards attempt to restrain them; but when he
called to them in a tone of firmness, “Non c'è ora
ricorso, No audience now,” they were hushed at
once.</P>
<P>He one afternoon gave us an entertaining dis∣sertation
on the ancient art of war. He observed
that the ancients allowed of little baggage, which
they very properly called “impedimenta;” where∣as
the moderns burden themselves with it to such
a degree, that 50,000 of our present soldiers are
allowed as much baggage as was formerly thought
sufficient for all the armies of the Roman empire.
He said it was good for soldiers to be heavy arm∣ed,
as it renders them proportionably robust; and
he remarked that when the Romans lightened
their arms, the troops became enfeebled. He
made a very curious observation with regard to the
towers full of armed men, which we are told were
borne on the backs of their elephants. He said
it must be a mistake; for if the towers were broad,
there would not be room for them on the backs of
elephants; for he and a friend who was an able cal∣culatour,
had measured a very large elephant at Na∣ples,
and made a computation of the space necessary
to hold the number of men said to be contained in
<PB N="369" REF="362"/>
those towers, and they found that the back of
the broadest elephant would not be sufficient, af∣ter
making the fullest allowance for what might
be hung by ballance on either side of the animal.
If again the towers were high, they would
fall; for he did not think it at all probable, that
the Romans had the art of tying on such mon∣strous
machines at a time when they had not
learnt the use even of girths to their saddles. He
said he did not give too much credit to the fi∣gures
on Trajan's pillar, many of which were un∣doubtedly
false. He said it was his opinion, that
those towers were only drawn by the elephants;
an opinion founded in probability, and free from
the difficulties of that which has been commonly
received.</P>
<P>Talking of various schemes of life, fit for a
man of spirit and education; I mentioned to
him that of being a foreign minister. He said
he thought it a very agreeable employment for
a man of parts and address, during some years of
his life. “In that situation, said he, a man will
insensibly attain to a greater knowledge of men
and manners, and a more perfect acquaintance
with the politicks of Europe. He will be pro∣moted
according to the returns which he makes”
<PB N="350" REF="363"/>
“to his court. They must be accurate, distinct,
without fire or ornament. He may subjoin his
own opinion, but he must do it with great mo∣desty.
The ministry at home are proud.”</P>
<P>He said the greatest happiness was not in glo∣ry,
but in goodness; and that Penn in his Ame∣rican
colony, where he had established a people
in quiet and contentment, was happier than Alex∣ander
the Great after destroying multitudes at
the conquest of Thebes. He observed that the
history of Alexander is obscure and dubious; for
his captains who divided his kingdom, were too
busy to record his life and actions, and would at
any rate wish to render him odious to posterity.</P>
<P>Never was I so thoroughly sensible of my
own defects as while I was in Corsica. I felt
how small were my abilities, and how little I
knew. Ambitious to be the companion of Paoli,
and to understand a country and a people which
roused me so much, I wished to be a Sir James
Mac Donald<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir James MacDonald baronet of the isle of Sky, who at the age of one and twenty, had the learning and abilities of a professour and a statesman, with the accomplishments of a man of the world. Eton and Oxford will ever remember him as one of their greatest ornaments. He was well known to the most distinguished in Europe, but was carried off from all their expectations. He died at Frescati, near Rome, in 1765. Had he lived a little longer, I believe I should have prevailed with him to visit Corsica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="364"/>
The last day which I spent with Paoli, appear∣ed
of inestimable value. I thought him more than
usually great and amiable, when I was upon
the eve of parting from him. The night before
my departure, a little incident happened which
shewed him in a most agreeable light. When
the servants were bringing in the desert after
supper, one of them chanced to let fall a plate
of walnuts. Instead of flying into a passion at
what the man could not help, Paoli said with
a smile, “No matter;” and turning to me, “It
is a good sign for you, Sir, Tempus est spargere
nuces, It is time to scatter walnuts. It is a ma∣trimonial
omen: You must go home to your own
country, and marry some fine woman whom you
really like. I shall rejoice to hear of it.”</P>
<P>This was a pretty allusion to the Roman ce∣remony
at weddings, of scattering walnuts. So
Virgil's Damon says,”</P>
<Q><L>Mopse novas incide faces: tibi ducitur uxor.</L>
<L>Sparge marite nuces: tibi deserit Hesperus Oetam.</L>
<L>VIRG. Eclog. viii. l. 30.</L>

<L>The walnuts strew! prepare the nuptial lights!</L>

<P>When I again asked Paoli if it was possible
for me in any way to shew him my great respect
and attachment, he replied, “Ricordatevi che Io
vi sia amico, e scrivetemi. Remember that I am
your friend, and write to me.” I said I hoped
that when he honoured me with a letter, he would
write not only as a commander, but as a philoso∣pher
and a man of letters. He took me by the
hand, and said, “As a friend.” I dare not tran∣scribe
from my private notes the feelings which I
had at this interview. I should perhaps appear
too enthusiastick. I took leave of Paoli with re∣gret
and agitation, not without some hopes of
seeing him again. From having known intimately
so exalted a character, my sentiments of human
nature were raised, while, by a sort of contagion, I
felt an honest ardour to distinguish myself, and be
useful, as far as my situation and abilities would
allow; and I was, for the rest of my life, set free
from a slavish timidity in the presence of great
men, for where shall I find a man greater than
Paoli?</P>
<P>When I set out from Sollacarò, I felt myself a
good deal indisposed. The old house of Colonna,
like the family of its master, was much decayed;
so that both wind and rain found their way into
my bed chamber. From this I contracted a se∣vere
<PB N="373" REF="368"/>
cold, which ended in a tertian ague. There
was no help for it. I might well submit to some
inconveniences, where I had enjoyed so much
happiness.</P>
<P>I was accompanied a part of the road by a
great swarthy priest, who had never been out of
Corsica. He was a very Hercules for strength
and resolution. He and two other Corsicans
took a castle, garrisoned by no less than fifteen
Genoese. Indeed the Corsicans have such a con∣tempt
for their enemies, that I have heard them
say, “Basterebbero le donne contra i Genovesi,
Our women would be enough against the Geno∣ese.”
This priest was a bluff, hearty, roaring fel∣low,
troubled neither with knowledge nor care. He
was ever and anon shewing me how stoutly his nag
could caper. He always rode some paces before
me, and sat in an attitude half turned round,
with his hand clapped upon the crupper. Then
he would burst out with comical songs about the
devil and the Genoese, and I don't know what all.
In short, notwithstanding my feverishness, he
kept me laughing whether I would or no.</P>
<P>I was returning to Corte; but I varied my
road a little from the way I had come, going
more upon the low country, and nearer the
western shore.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="369"/>
At Cauro I had a fine view of Ajaccio and its
environs. My ague was some time of forming,
so I had frequent intervals of ease, which I em∣ployed
in observing whatever occurred. I was
lodged at Cauro in the house of Signor Peraldi of
Ajaccio, who received me with great politeness.
I found here another provincial magistracy. Be∣fore
supper, Signor Peraldi and a young Abbé of
Ajaccio entertained me with some airs on the vio∣lin.
After they had shewn me their taste in fine
improved musick, they gave me some original
Corsican airs, and at my desire, they brought
up four of the guards of the magistracy, and
made them shew me a Corsican dance. It was
truly savage. They thumped with their heels,
sprung upon their toes, brandished their arms,
wheeled and leaped with the most violent gesticu∣lations.
It gave me the idea of an admirable
war dance.</P>
<P>During this journey I had very bad weather.
I cannot forget the worthy rectour of Cuttoli,
whose house afforded me a hospitable retreat,
when wet to the skin, and quite overcome by
the severity of the storm, which my sickness
made me little able to resist. He was directly
such a venerable hermit as we read of in the old
romances. His figure and manner interested me
at first sight. I found he was a man well re∣spected
<PB N="375" REF="370"/>
in the island, and that the General did
him the honour to correspond with him. He
gave me a simple collation of eggs, chestnuts
and wine, and was very liberal of his ham and
other more substantial victuals to my servant.
The honest Swiss was by this time very well
pleased to have his face turned towards the con∣tinent.
He was heartily tired of seeing foreign
parts, and meeting with scanty meals and hard
beds, in an island which he could not compre∣hend
the pleasure of visiting. He said to me,
“Si J'etois encore une fois retourné à mon pais
parmi ces montagnes de suisse dont monsieur fait
tant des plaisanteries, Je verrai qui m'engagera à
les quitter. If I were once more at home in my
own country, among those mountains of Swit∣zerland,
on which you have had so many jokes,
I will see who shall prevail with me to quit them.”</P>
<P>The General out of his great politeness, would
not allow me to travel without a couple of cho∣sen
guards to attend me in case of any accidents.
I made them my companions, to relieve the te∣diousness
of my journey. One of them called
Ambrosio, was a strange iron-couloured fearless
creature. He had been much in war; careless of
wounds, he was coolly intent on destroying
the enemy. He told me, as a good anecdote, that
having been so lucky as to get a view of two
<PB N="376" REF="371"/>
Genoese exactly in a line, he took his aim, and
shot them both through the head at once. He
talked of this, just as one would talk of shooting
a couple of crows. I was sure I needed be under
no apprehension; but I don't know how, I de∣sired
Ambrosio to march before me, that I might
see him.</P>
<P>I was upon my guard how I treated him.
But as sickness frets one's temper, I sometimes
forgot myself, and called him “bestia, block∣head;”
and once when he was at a loss which way
to go, at a wild woody part of the country, I fell
into a passion, and called to him “Mi maraviglio
che un uomo si bravo può esser si stupido, I am
amazed that so brave a man can be so stupid.”
However by afterwards calling him friend, and
speaking softly to him, I soon made him forget
my ill humour, and we proceeded as before.</P>
<P>Paoli had also been so good as to make me a
present of one of his dogs, a strong and fierce
animal. But he was too old to take an attach∣ment
to me, and I lost him between Lyons and
Paris. The General has promised me a young
one, to be a guard at Auchinleck.</P>
<P>At Bogognano I came upon the same road
I had formerly travelled from Corte, where I ar∣rived
safe after all my fatigues. My good fa∣thers
<PB N="377" REF="372"/>
of the Franciscan convent, received me like
an old acquaintance, and shewed a kind concern
at my illness. I sent my respects to the Great
Chancellor, who returned me a note, of which I
insert a translation as a specimen of the hearty ci∣vility
to be found among the highest in Corsica.</P>
<P>“Many congratulations to Mr. Boswell on his
return from beyond the mountains, from his
servant Massesi, who is at the same time very sor∣ry
for his indisposition, which he is persuaded has
been occasioned by his severe journey. He how∣ever
flatters himself, that when Mr. Boswell has
reposed himself a little, he will recover his usual
health. In the mean time he has taken the li∣berty
to send him a couple of fowls, which he
hopes, he will honour with his acceptance, as he
will need some refreshment this evening. He
wishes him a good night, as does his little servant
Luiggi, who will attend him to-morrow, to dis∣charge
his duty.”</P>
<P>My ague distressed me so much, that I was
confined to the convent for several days. I did not,
however, find myself weary. I was visited by the
Great Chancellor, and several others of the civil
magistrates, and by Padre Mariani rectour of the
university, a man of learning and abilities, as a
proof of which he had been three years at Madrid
<PB N="378" REF="373"/>
in the character of secretary to the General of the
Franciscans. I remember a very eloquent ex∣pression
of his, on the state of his country. “Cor∣sica,
said he, has for many years past, been bleed∣ing
at all her veins. They are now closed. But
after being so severely exhausted, it will take some
time before she can recover perfect strength.” I
was also visited by Padre Leonardo, of whose ani∣mating
discourse I have made mention in a for∣mer
part of this book.</P>
<P>Indeed I should not have been at a loss though
my very reverend fathers had been all my society.
I was not in the least looked upon as a heretick.
Difference of faith was forgotten in hospitality.
I went about the convent as if I had been in my
own house; and the fathers without any impro∣priety
of mirth, were yet as cheerful as I could
desire.</P>
<P>I had two surgeons to attend me at Corte, a
Corsican and a Piedmontese; and I got a little
Jesuit's bark from the spiceria or apothecary's
shop, of the Capuchin covent. I did not how∣ever
expect to be effectually cured, till I should
get to Bastia. I found it was perfectly safe for
me to go thither. There was a kind of truce be∣tween
the Corsicans and the French. Paoli had
held two different amicable conferences with M.
de Marboeuf their commander in chief, and was
<PB N="379" REF="374"/>
so well with him, that he gave me a letter of re∣commendation
to him.</P>
<P>On one of the days that my ague disturbed
me least, I walked from the convent to Corte,
purposely to write a letter to Mr. Samuel John∣son.
I told my revered friend, that from a kind
of superstition agreeable in a certain degree to
him, as well as to myself, I had, during my tra∣vels,
written to him from LOCA SOLENNIA, places
in some measure sacred. That as I had written
to him from the Tomb of Melancthon, sacred to
learning and piety, I new wrote to him from
the palace of Pascal Paoli, sacred to wisdom and
liberty; knowing that however his political prin∣ciples
may have been represented, he had always
a generous zeal for the common rights of hu∣manity.
I gave him a sketch of the great things
I had seen in Corsica, and promised him a more
ample relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson was pleased with what I wrote
here; for I received at Paris an answer from him
which I keep as valuable charter. “When you
return, you will return to an unaltered, and I
hope, unalterable friend. All that you have to
fear from me, is the vexation of disappointing
me. No man loves to frustrate expectations
which have been formed in his favour, and the
<PB N="380" REF="375"/>
pleasure which I promise myself from your jour∣nals
and remarks, is so great, that perhaps no
degree of attention or discernment will be suf∣ficient
to afford it. Come home however and
take your chance. I long to see you, and to
hear you; and hope that we shall not be so long
separated again. Come home, and expect such
a welcome as is due to him whom a wise and
noble curiosity has led where perhaps, no native
of this country ever was before.”</P>
<P>I at length set our for Bastia. I went the first
night to Rostino, hoping to have found there
Signor Clemente de' Paoli. But unluckily he had
gone upon a visit to his daughter; so that I had
not an opportunity of seeing this extraordinary
personage, of whom I have given so full an ac∣count,
for a great part of which I am indebted
to Mr. Burnaby.</P>
<P>Next day I reached Vescovato, where I was
received by Signor Buttafoco, colonel of the Royal
Corsicans in the service of France, with whom I
past some days.</P>
<P>As various discourses have been held in Eu∣rope,
concerning an invitation given to M. Rous∣seau
to come to Corsica; and as that affair was
conducted by Signor Buttafoco, who shewed me
the whole correspondence between him and M.
<PB N="381" REF="376"/>
Rousseau, I am enabled to give a distinct account
of it.</P>
<P>M. Rousseau in his Political Treatise, entitled
DU CONTRACT SOCIAL, has the following obser∣vation:
“Il est encore en Europe un pays ca∣pable
de législation; c'est l'isle de Corse. La va∣leur
et la constance avec laquelle ce brave peuple
a su recouvrer et défendre sa liberté mériteroit
bien que quelque homme sage lui apprit à la
conserver. J'ai quelque pressentiment qu'un jour
cette petite isle etonnera l'Europe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Du Contract Social. liv. ii. chap. 10.</NOTE>. There is
yet one country in Europe, capable of legislation;
and that is the island of Corsica. The valour
and the constancy with which that brave people
hath recovered and defended its liberty, would
well deserve that some wise man should teach
them how to preserve it. I have some presenti∣ment
that one day that little island will astonish
Europe.”</P>
<P>Signor Buttafoco, upon this, wrote to M.
Rousseau, returning him thanks for the honour
he had done to the Corsican nation, and strongly
inviting him to come over, and be that wise man
who should illuminate their minds.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="377"/>
I was allowed to take a copy of the wild phi∣losopher's
answer to this invitation; it is written
with his usual eloquence.</P>
<P>“Il est superflu, Monsieur, de chercher à exci∣ter
mon zele pour l'entreprise que vous me pro∣posez.
Sa seule idée m'eleve l'ame et me trans∣porte.
Je croirois la reste de mes jours bien
noblement, bien vertueusement et bien heureuse∣ment
employés. Je croirois meme avoir bien
racheté l'inutilité des autres, si je pouvois rendre
ce triste reste bon en quelque chose à vos braves
compatriotes; si je pouvois concourir par quel∣que
conseil utile aux vûes de votre digne Chef
et aux votres; de ce coté la donc soyez sur de
moi. Ma vie et mon coeur sont à vous.”</P>
<P>“It is superfluous, Sir, to endeavour to excite
my zeal for the undertaking which you propose
to me. The very idea of it elevates my soul
and transports me. I should esteem the rest of
my days very nobly, very virtuously, and very
happily employed. I should even think that I
well redeemed the inutility of many of my days
that are past, if I could render these sad re∣mains
of any advantage to your brave country∣men.
If by any useful advice, I could con∣cur
in the views of your worthy Chief, and in”
<PB N="383" REF="378"/>
“yours. So far then you may be sure of me. My
life and my heart are devoted to you.”</P>
<P>Such were the first effusions of Rousseau. Yet
before he concluded even this first letter, he made
a great many complaints of his adversities and
persecutions, and started a variety of difficulties
as to the proposed enterprise.</P>
<P>The correspondence was kept up for some
time, but the enthusiasm of the paradoxical phi∣losopher
gradually subsiding, the scheme came to
nothing.</P>
<P>As I have formerly observed, M. de Voltaire
thought proper to exercise his pleasantry upon
occasion of this proposal, in order to vex the
grave Rousseau, whom he never could bear. I
remember he used to talk of him with a saty∣rical
smile, and call him, “Ce Garçon, That
Lad;” I find this among my notes of M. de Vol∣taire's
conversations, when I was with him at his
Chateau de Ferney, where he entertains with the
elegance rather of a real prince than of a poetical
one.</P>
<P>To have Voltaire's assertion contradicted by a
letter under Paoli's own hand, was no doubt a
sufficient satisfaction to Rousseau.</P>
<P>From the account which I have attempted to
give of the present constitution of Corsica, and of
<PB N="384" REF="379"/>
its illustrious Legislator and General, it may well
be conceived that the scheme of bringing M.
Rousseau into that island, was magnified to an
extravagant degree by the reports of the conti∣nent.
It was said, that Rousseau was to be made
no less than a Solon by the Corsicans, who
were implicitely to receive from him a code of
laws.</P>
<P>This was by no means the scheme. Paoli was
too able a man to submit the legislation of his
country to one who was an entire stranger to the
people, the manners, and in short to every thing
in the island. Nay I know well that Paoli pays
more regard to what has been tried by the expe∣rience
of ages, than to the most beautiful ideal
systems. Besides, the Corsicans were not all at
once to be moulded at will. They were to be
gradually prepared, and by one law laying the
foundation for another, a complete fabrick of
jurisprudence was to be formed.</P>
<P>Paoli's intention was to grant a generous asy∣lum
to Rousseau, to avail himself of the shining
talents which appeared in his writings, by consult∣ing
with him, and catching the lights of his rich
imagination, from many of which he might derive
improvements to those plans which his own wis∣dom
had laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="380"/>
But what he had principally in view, was to
employ the pen of Rousseau in recording the he∣roick
actions of the brave islanders. It is to be
regretted that this project did not take place.
The father of the present colonel Buttafoco
made large collections for many years back.
These are carefully preserved, and when joined
to those made by the Abbé Rostini, would fur∣nish
ample materials for a History of Corsica.
This, adorned with the genius of Rousseau,
would have been one of the noblest monuments of
modern times.</P>
<P>Signor Buttafoco accompanied me to Bastia.
It was comfortable to enter a good warm town
after my fatigues. We went to the house of
Signor Morelli, a counsellor at law here, with
whom we supped. I was lodged for that night
by a friend of Signor Buttafoco, in another part
of the town.</P>
<P>Next morning I waited on M. de Marboeuf.
Signor Buttafoco introduced me to him, and I
presented him the letter of recommendation from
Paoli. He gave me a most polite reception.
The brilliancy of his levee pleased me; it was a
scene so different from those which I had been
for some time accustomed to see. It was like
<PB N="386" REF="381"/>
passing at once from a rude and early age, to a
polished modern age; from the mountains of
Corsica, to the banks of the Seine.</P>
<P>My ague was now becoem so violent, that it
got the better of me altogether. I was obliged
to ask the French general's permission to have a
chair set for me in the circle. When M. de
Marboeuf was informed of my being ill, he had
the goodness to ask me to stay in his house till I
should recover; “I insist upon it, said he; I have
a warm room for you. My servants will get you
bouillons, and every thing proper for a sick
man; and we have an excellent physician.” I
mention all these circumstances to shew the
goodness of M. de Marboeuf, to whom I shall
ever consider myself as under great obligations.
His invitation was given in so kind and cordial
a manner, that I willingly accepted of it.</P>
<P>I found M. de Marboeuf a worthy open∣hearted
Frenchman. It is a common and a
very just remark, that one of the most agree∣able
characters in the world is a Frenchman who
has served long in the army, and has arrived at
that age when the fire of youth is properly temp∣pered.
Such a character is gay without levity,
and judicious without severity. Such a charac∣ter
was the Count de Marboeuf, of an ancient
<PB N="387" REF="382"/>
family in Britanny, where there is more plainness
of character than among the other French. He
had been Gentilhomme de la Chambre to the
worthy King Stanislaus.</P>
<P>He took a charge of me as if he had been my
near relation. He furnished me with books and
every thing he could think of to amuse me.
While the physician ordered me to be kept very
quiet, M. de Marboeuf would allow nobody to
go near me, but payed me a friendly visit alone.
As I grew better, he gradually encreased my so∣ciety,
bringing with him more and more of his
officers; so that I had at last the honour of very
large companies in my apartment. The officers
were polite agreeable men: some of them had
been prisoners in England, during the last war.
One of them was a Chevalier de St. Louis, of
the name of Douglas, a descendant of the illus∣trious
house of Douglas in Scotland, by a branch
settled near to Lyons. This gentleman often
came and sat with me. The idea of our being
in some sort countrymen, was pleasing to us
both.</P>
<P>I found here an English woman of Penrith in
Cumberland. When the Highlanders marched
through that country in the year 1745, she had
married a soldier of the French picquets in the
<PB N="388" REF="383"/>
very midst of all the confusion and danger, and
when she could hardly understand one word he
said. Such freaks will love sometimes take.</P>

<P>M. de la Chapelle was the physician who at∣tended
me. He had been several years physician
to the army at Minorca, and had now the same
office in Corsica I called him the physician of
the isles. He was indeed an excellent one. That
gayeté de coeur which the French enjoy, runs
through all their professions. I remember the
phrase of an English common soldier, who told
me, “that at the battle of Fontenoy, his captain
received a shot in the breast, and fell, said the sol∣dier,
with his spontoon in his hand, as prettily
killed as ever I see'd a gentleman.” The soldier's
phrase might be used in talking of almost every
thing which the French do. I may say I was
prettily cured by M. de la Chapelle.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="384"/>
But I think myself bound to relate a circum∣stance
which shews him and his nation in the gen∣teelest
light. Though he attended me with the
greatest assiduity, yet, when I was going away,
he would not accept of a single Louis d'or. “No
Sir, said he, I am nobly paid by my king. I am
physician to his army here. If I can at the same
time, be of service to the people of the country,
or to any gentleman who may come among us,
I am happy. But I must be excused from taking
money.” M. Brion the surgeon major behaved in
the same manner.</P>
<P>As soon as I had gathered a little strength, I
walked about as well as I could; and saw what
was to be seen at Bastia. Signor Morelli was re∣markably
obliging. He made me presents of
books and antiques, and of every other-curiosity
relating to Corsica. I never saw a more generous
man. Signor Caraffa, a Corsican officer in the
service of France, with the order of St. Louis,
was also very obliging. Having made a longer
stay in Corsica than I intended, my finances were
exhausted, and he let me have as much money
as I pleased. M. Barlé, secretary to M. de Mar∣boeuf,
was also very obliging. In short, I know
not how to express my thankfulness to all the
good people whom I saw at Bastia.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="385"/>
The French seemed to agree very well with
the Corsicans. Of old, those islanders were
much indebted to the interposition of France,
in their favour. But since the days of Sampiero,
there have been many variances between them.
A singular one happened in the reign of Lewis
XIV. The Pope's Corsican guards in some fit
of passion insulted the French ambassadour at
Rome. The superb monarch resolved to revenge
this outrage. But Pope Alexander VII. fore∣seeing
the consequences, agreed to the conditions
required by France; which were, that the Corsi∣can
guards should be obliged to depart the eccle∣siastical
state, that the nation should be declared
incapable ever to serve the holy see, and, that
opposite to their ancient guard-house, should be
erected a pyramid inscribed with their dis∣grace<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Corps Diplomatique anno 1664.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Le Brun, whose royal genius could magnify
and enrich every circumstance in honour of his
sovereign, has given this story as a medaillion on
one of the compartments of the great gallery
at Versailles. France appears with a stately air,
shewing to Rome the design of the pyramid; and
Rome, though bearing a shield marked S. P. Q. R.
receives the design with most submissive humility.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="386"/>
I wish that France had never done the Corsi∣cans
greater harm than depriving them of the
honour of being the pope's guards. Boisseux
and Maillebois cannot easily be forgotten; nor
can the brave islanders be blamed for complain∣ing
that a powerful nation should interpose to re∣tard
their obtaining entire possession of their coun∣try,
and of undisturbed freedom.</P>
<P>M. de Marboeuf appeared to conduct himself
with the greatest prudence and moderation. He
told me that he wished to preserve peace in Cor∣sica.
He had entered into a convention with
Paoli, mutually to give up such criminals as
should fly into each others territories. Formerly
not one criminal in a hundred was punished.
There was no communication between the Cor∣sicans
and the Genoese; and if a criminal could
but escape from the one jurisdiction to the other,
he was safe. This was very easily done, so that
crimes from impunity were very frequent. By
this equitable convention, justice has been fully
administered.</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed the residence of the French in
Corsica, has, upon the whole, been an advantage
to the patriots. There have been markets twice
a week at the frontiers of each garrison-town,
where the Corsican peasants have sold all sorts of
<PB N="392" REF="387"/>
provisions, and brought in a good many French
crowns; which have been melted down into Cor∣sican
money. A cessation of arms for a few years
has been a breathing time to the nation, to pre∣pare
itself for one great effort, which will proba∣bly
end in the total expulsion of the Genoese. A
little leisure has been given for attending to civil
improvements, towards which the example of the
French has in no small degree contributed. Many
of the soldiers were excellent handi-craftsmen,
and could instruct the natives in various arts.</P>
<P>M. de Marboeuf entertained himself by laying
out several elegant pieces of pleasure ground;
and such were the humane and amicable disposi∣tions
of this respectable officer, that he was at
pains to observe what things were most wante<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in Corsica, and then imported them from France,
in order to shew an example to the inhabitants.
He introduced in particular, the culture of pota∣toes,
of which there were none in the island upon
his arrival. This root will be of considerable ser∣vice
to the Corsicans, it will make a wholesome
variety in their food; and as there will thereby,
of consequence, be less home consumption of
chestnuts, they will be able to export a greater
quantity of them.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="388"/>
M. de Marboeuf made merry upon the reports
which had been circulated; that I was no less than
a minister from the British court. The Avignon
gazette brought us one day information, that the
English were going to establish Un Bureau de
Commerce in Corsica. “O Sir, said he, the se∣cret
is out. I see now the motive of your desti∣nation
to these parts. It is you who are to esta∣blish
this Bureau de Commerce.”</P>
<P>Idle as these rumours were, it is a fact that,
when I was at Genoa, Signor Gherardi, one of
their secretaries of state, very seriously told me,
“Monsieur, vous m'avez faitt rembler quoique je
ne vous ai jamais vu. Sir, you have made me
tremble although I never saw you before.” And
when I smiled and assured him that I was just a
simple traveller, he shook his head; but said, he
had very authentick information concerning me.
He then told me with great gravity, “That while
I travelled in Corsica, I was d rest in scarlet and
gold; but when I payed my respects to the Su∣preme
Council at Corte, I appeared in a full suit
of black.” These important truths I fairly own∣ed
to him, and he seemed to exult over me.</P>
<P>I was more and more obliged to M. de Mar∣boeuf.
When I was allowed by my physician, to
go to his Excellency's table, where we had always
<PB N="394" REF="389"/>
a large company, and every thing in great mag∣nificence,
he was so careful of me, that he would
not suffer me to eat any thing, or taste a glass of
wine, more than was prescribed for me. He used
to say, “I am here both physician and commander
in chief; so you must submit.” He very politely
prest me to make some stay with him, saying,
“We have taken care of you when sick, I think
we have a claim to you for a while, when in health.”
His kindness followed me after I left him. It pro∣cured
me an agreeable reception from M. Michel,
the French chargé d'affaires at Genoa; and was
the occasion of my being honoured with great
civilities at Paris, by M. l'Abbé de Marboeuf
Conseiller d'etat, brother of the Count, and pos∣sessing
similar virtues in private life.</P>
<P>I quitted Corsica with reluctance, when I
thought of the illustrious Paoli. I wrote to him
from Bastia, informing him of my illness, which
I said, was owing to his having made me a man
of so much consequence, that instead of putting
me into a snug little room, he had lodged me in
the magnificent old palace, where the wind and
rain entered.</P>
<P>His answer to my first letter is written with so
much spirit, that I begged his permission to pub∣blish
it; which he granted in the genteelest man∣ner,
<PB N="395" REF="390"/>
saying, “I do not remember the contents of
of the letter; but I have such a confidence in
Mr. Boswell, that I am sure, he would not pub∣lish
it, if there was any thing in it improper for
publick view; so he has my permission.” I am
thus enabled to present my readers with an origi∣nal
letter from Paoli.</P>

<HEAD>TO JAMES BOSWELL, Es{que}
OF AUCHINLECK, SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>STIMATISSIMO SIGNOR BOSWELL,
RICEVEI la lettera che mi favori da Bastia, e
mi consolo assai colla notizia di essersi rimessa in
perfetta salute. Buon per lei che cadde in mano
di un valente medico! Quando altra volta il dis∣gusto
de' paesi colti, ed ameni lo prendesse, e lo
portasse in questa infelice contrada, procurerò che
sia alloggiata in camere più calde, e custodite di
quelle della caso Colonna in Sollacarò; mà ella
ancora dovrà contentarsi di non viaggiare quando
la giornata, e la stagione vogliono che si resti in
casa per attendere il tempo buono. Io resto ora
impaziente per la lettera che ha promesso scrivermi
da Genova, dove dubito assai che la delicatezza di
quelle dame non le abbia fatto fare qualche giorno
di quarantena, per ispurgarsi di ogni anche più
<PB N="396" REF="391"/>
leggiero influsso, che possa avere portato seco dell'
aria di questo paese; e molto più, se le fosse ve∣nuto
il capriccio di far vedere quell' abito di ve∣luto
Corso, e quel berrettone, di cui i Corsi vogli∣ono
l'origine dagli elmi antichi, ed i Genovesi lo
dicono inventato da quelli, che, rubando alla stra∣da,
non vogliano essere conosciuti: come se in
tempo del loro governo avessero mai avuta ap∣prensione
di castigo i ladri pubblici? Son sicuro
però, che ella presso avrà il buon partito con quel∣le
amabili, e delicate persone, insinuando alle me∣desime,
che il cuore delle belle è fatto per la com∣passione,
non per il disprezzo, e per la tirannia;
e cosi sarà rientrato facilmente nella lor grazia. Io
ritornato in Corte ebbi subito la notizia del secre∣to▪
sbarco dell' Abbatucci nelle spiaggie di Solen∣zara.
Tutte le apparenze fanno credere che il
medesimo sia venuto con disegni opposti alla pub∣blica
quiete; pure si è constituito in castello, e
protesta ravvedimento. Nel venire per Bocog∣nano
si seppe, che un capitano riformato Geno∣vese
cercave compagni per assassinarmi. Non potè
rinvenirne e vedendosi scoperto si pose alla mac∣chia,
dove è stato ucciso dalle squadriglie che gli
tenevano dietro i magistrati delle provincie oltra∣montane.
Queste insidie non sembrano buoni pre∣liminari
del nostro accomodamento colla repub∣blica
<PB N="397" REF="392"/>
di Genova. Io sto passando il sindicato a
questa provincia di Nebbio. Verso il 10 dell' en∣trante
anderò per l' istesso oggetto in quella del
Capocorso, ed il mese di Febrajo facilmente mi
trattenerò in Balagna. Ritornerò poi in Corte alla
primavera, per prepararmi all' apertura della con∣sulta
generale. In ogni luogo avrò presente la sua
amicizia, e sarò desideroso de' continui suoi riscon∣tri.

<DIV2>
<HEAD>MUCH ESTEEMED MR. BOSWELL,</HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED the letter which you wrote to me
from Bastia, and am much comforted by hearing
that you are restored to perfect health. It is lucky
for you that you fell into the hands of an able
physician. When you shall again be seized with
a disgust at improved and agreeable countries,
and shall return to this ill-fated land, I will take
care to have you lodged in warmer and better
finished apartments than those of the house of
Colonna, at Sollacarò. But you again should be
satisfied not to travel when the weather and the
season require one to keep within doors, and
<PB N="398" REF="393"/>
wait for a fair day. I expect with impatience the
letter which you promised to write to me from
Genoa, where I much suspect that the delicacy of
the ladies will have obliged you to perform some
days of quarantine, for purifying you from every
the least infection, which you may have carried
with you from the air of this country: and still
more so, if you have taken the whim to shew
that suit of Corsican velvet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Corsican velvet he means the coarse stuff made in the island, which is all that the Corsicans have in stead of the fine velvet of Genoa.</NOTE> and that bonnet of
which the Corsicans will have the origin to be
from the ancient helmets, whereas the Genoese
say it was invented by those who rob on the
highway, in order to disguise themselves; as if
during the Genoese government, public robbers
needed to fear punishment. I am sure however,
that you will have taken the proper method with
these amiable and delicate persons, insinuating to
them, that the hearts of beauties are formed for
compassion, and not for disdain and tyranny:
and so you will have been easily restored to their
good graces. Immediately on my return to
Corte, I received information of the secret land∣ing
of Abbatucci<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Abbatucci, a Corsican of a very suspicious character.</NOTE>, on the coast of Solenzara.
All appearances make us believe, that he is come
<PB N="399" REF="394"/>
with designs contrary to the public quiet. He
has however surrendered himself a prisoner at the
castle, and protests his repentance. As I passed
by Bogognano, I learnt that a disbanded Genoese
officer was seeking associates to assassinate me.
He could not succced, and finding that he was
discovered, he betook himself to the woods;
where he has been slain by the party detached
by the magistrates of the provinces on the other
side of the mountains, in order to intercept him.
These ambuscades do not seem to be good preli∣minaries
towards our accommodation with the re∣publick
of Genoa. I am now holding the syndi∣cato
in this province of Nebbio. About the 10th
of next month, I shall go, for the same object,
into the province of Capo Corso, and during the
month of February, I shall probably fix my resi∣dence
in Balagna. I shall return to Corte in the
spring, to prepare myself for the opening of the
General Consulta. Wherever I am, your friend∣ship
will be present to my mind, and I shall be
desirous to continue a correspondence with you.
Meanwhile believe me to be</P>

<P>Can any thing be more condescending, and at
the same time shew more the firmness of an hero∣ick
mind, than this letter? With what a gallant
pleasantry does the Corsican Chief talk of his ene∣mies!
One would think that the Queens of Ge∣noa
should become rival Queens for Paoli. If
they saw him, I am sure they would.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to repeat an observation made
to me by that illustrious minister, whom Paoli
calls the Pericles of Great Britain: “It may be
said of Paoli,” as the Cardinal de Retz said of the
great Montrose, “C'est un de ces hommes qu'on
ne trouve plus que dans les Vies de Plutarque.
He is one of those men who are no longer to be
found but in the lives of Plutarch.”</P>
