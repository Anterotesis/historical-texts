AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE LETTER OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE TO A GENTLEMAN IN PARIS, ON THE <HI>REVOLUTION IN FRANCE:</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages are the result of an attempt to compress and arrange those arguments, which coming from a great Statesman, on a momentous and seasonable subject, have not failed already to obtain, as they deserve, an extraordinary share of public attention. However, the Editor understands from all quarters, that there still remain a very con∣siderable number to whom the substance would be acceptable in a smaller compass. Neither is it any impeachment of the admirable original to say, what Mr. Burke himself has said in the preface, that being written for private use, in the form of a letter, the arguments do not, perhaps, follow in that regular order which is best adapted to common ap∣prehension. When brought into one view, they speak for themselves, in answer to all cavils upon the subject; and evince that there exists, independently of foreign or questionable matter, an entire body of reasoning proof against the attack of heedless or par∣tial criticism.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Ever since the work first appeared the National Assembly has been confirming its truth; betraying more and more those principles by which the author had proved that they were actuated. Lest any doubt might remain of their suspected design <HI>of abolishing the Christian Religion,</HI> by bringing its ministers into contempt, their last proceedings have been per∣fectly explicit and unequivocal. By a cruel and ma∣licious refinement upon tyranny, they have at length reduced the clergy to this terrible alternative; either with a solemn oath to ratify the destruction of their church, or to escape from its ruins, committing what remains to mercenaries, who having lost their character, have lost, when the last stroke comes to be made, their only principle of security! The As∣sembly well knows that in such hands Christianity lies entirely at their mercy.</P>
<P>And let the English reader beware how he consi∣der himself an unconcerned spectator: nor when he reads of an intriguing monied interest conspiring with a restless literary cabal against the religion and property of their country, let him slight too hastily that advice of Mr. Burke, <Q>“At home we behold similar beginnings, we should be on our guard against similar conclusions.”</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ABRIDGMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I. <HI>The conduct of those Clubs in England which have recommended to us the example of France.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU see by the Letter that I have transmitted to you, that, though I do most heartily wish that France may be animated by a spirit of rational liberty, it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning some material points in your late trans∣action.</P>
<P>You imagined, when you wrote last, that I might possibly be reckoned among the approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the solemn public seal of sanction they have received, from two Clubs of Gentlemen in London called the Revolution Soci∣ety, and the Constitutional Society.</P>
<P>For one, I should be sorry to be thought directly or indirectly concerned in their proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
I should think it at least improper and irregular for me to open <HI>a formal public correspondence with the actual government of a foreign nation,</HI> without the express authority of the government under which I live.</P>
<P>I should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence, <HI>under any thing like an equivocal de∣scription,</HI> which to many unacquainted with our usages, might make the address in which I joined, appear the act of persons in some sort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws of this king∣dom, and authorized to speak the sense of some part of it—a policy that has very much the com∣plection of a fraud.</P>
<P>I must be tolerably sure too, before I venture publicly to congratualte men on a blessing, that they have <HI>really</HI> received one. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please. We ought to see what it will please them to do, be∣fore we risque congratulations which may be soon turned into complaints.</P>
<P>I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with mo∣rality and religion; with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social man∣ners. All these (in their way) are good things too; and without them, liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and is not likely to continue long.</P>
<P>These considerations, however, were below the dignity of the Revolution Society; but now that we
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
are in a condition to discern the true nature of the object held up to our attention, their design of draw∣ing us into an imitation of the National Assembly of France gives me a considerable degree of uneasiness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II. <HI>The nature of that example which the French have given us.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is our monarchy, after their example, to be anni∣hilated, with all the laws, all the tribunals, and all the ancient corporations of the kingdom? Is every landmark of the country to be done away, in favour of a geometrical and arithmetical constitution? Is the House of Lords to be voted useless? Is episco∣pacy to be abolished? Are the church lands to be sold to Jews and jobbers, or given to bribe new-in∣vented municipal republics into a participation in sacrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances, and the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic presents? Are silver shoe-buckles to be substituted in the place of the land tax and the malt tax for the support of the naval strength of this king∣dom? Are all orders, ranks, and distinctions to be confounded, that universal anarchy may arise out of national Bankruptcy? For this great end is the army to be seduced from its discipline and its fidelity; first by every kind of debauchery, and then by the terrible precedent of a donative in the increase of pay? Are the curates to be seduced from their bishops by holding out to them the delusive hope of a dole out of the spoils of their own order? Are the citi∣zens of London, like those of Paris, to be drawn
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
from their allegiance by feeding them at the expence of their fellow subjects? Is a compulsory paper cur∣rency to be substituted in the place of the legal coin of this kingdom? Is what remains of the plundered stock of public revenue, to be employed in the wild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with one another?—If these are the ends and means of the Revolution Society, I admit they are well assorted; and France may fur∣nish them for both with precedents in point.</P>
<P>I am no stranger to the faults and defects of the subverted government of France; but is it true, that the French government was such as to be utterly incapable of reform? All France was of a different opinion in the beginning of the year 1789. The instructions to the representatives of the States Gene∣ral, from every district in that kingdom, were filled with projects for the <HI>refermation</HI> of that government, without the remotest suggestion of <HI>a design to de∣stroy it.</HI> The true question at present is, whether those who have destroyed, or those who would have reformed, are in the right? Upon a free constitu∣tion there was but one opinion in France. All the struggle, all the dissention arose afterwards. The triumph of the victorious party was over the prin∣ciple of a <HI>British Constitution.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>1st. Respecting the Constitution of their Legislature.</HEAD>
<P>We have a right therefore to expect that some very unusual appearances of wisdom will display themselves on the face of the designs of those who
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
appeal to no practice, and who copy after no model. Has any such been manifested? Let us examine, first, the Constitution of their Legislature. Here your new Constitution is the very reverse of ours in its principle. The Member who goes to the National Assembly is not chosen by the people, nor accoun∣table to them. There are three elections before he is chosen; two sets of magistracy intervene between him and the Assembly; so that the whole spirit of election is changed, and there is no way to make a connection between the original constituent and the representative. Every man who has served in an assembly is ineligible for two years after. Just as these magistrates begin to learn their trade, they are disqualified for exercising it. Your Constitution has too much of jealousy to have much of sense in it:—You consider the breach of trust in the representative so principally, that you do not at all regard the ques∣tion of his fitness to execute it.</P>
<P>In order to secure a steady and moderate conduct in such assemblies, it is necessary that the body of them should be respectably composed, in point of condition of life, of permanent property, of education, and of such habits as enlarge and liberalize the understanding. In the calling of the States General of France, the first thing which struck me was a great departure from the ancient course. I found the representation of the Third Estate, composed of six hundred persons: they were equal in number to the representation of both the other orders: now as the orders were not to act separately, but to be melted down into one, the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
policy of this numerous representative became obvi∣ous; a very small desertion from either of the other two orders must throw the power of both into the hands of the third. In fact, the whole power of the State was soon resolved into that body. But, it is answered, the representation of twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred thousand. True; if the constitution of a kingdom be a problem of arithmetic. However, a government of five hun∣dred country attornies and obscure curates is not good for twenty-four millions of men, though it were chosen by eight millions; nor is it the better for being guided by a dozen of persons of quality, who have betrayed their trust in order to obtain that power; for such in general is the composition of the governing majority of the National Assembly, which I can never consider as any thing else than a voluntary association of men, who have availed them∣selves of circumstances to seize upon the power of the State, and in which is scarcely to be perceived the slightest trace of what we call the natural landed interest of the country.</P>
<P>This Assembly, which overthrows kings and kingdoms, has not even the physiognomy and aspect of a grave legislative body; they act like the come∣dians of a fair before a riotous audience; they act amidst the tumultuous cries of a mixed mob of fero∣cious men and of women lost to shame, who, accor∣ding to their insolent fancies, direct, controul, ap∣plaud, explode them; and sometimes mix and take their seats amongst them. Who is it that admires
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and from the heart is attached to national representa∣tive assemblies, but must turn with horror and disgust from such a profane burlesque, and abominable per∣version of that sacred institute.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>2. <HI>Their Executive Power.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Let us turn then our eyes to what they have done towards the formation of an executive power. For this they have chosen <HI>a degraded king.</HI> This their first executive officer is to be a machine without any sort of deliberative discretion in any one act of his function. The King of France is not the fountain of justice. A thousand times better it had been for this unappy prince if he had nothing at all to do with its administration; deprived as he is of all that is venerable and all that is consolatory in that function, without a power of originating any process; without a power of suspension, mitigation, or pardon.</P>
<P>He is no more the fountain of honour, than he is of justice. All rewards, all distinctions are in other hands. He has no negative; yet his name and au∣thority must be used to enforce every harsh decree. Nay, he must concur in the butchery of those who shall attempt to free him from his imprisonment. A king, circumstanced like the present, can have no generous interest to excite him to action. To infe∣rior people such an office might be a matter of ho∣nour—but to be raised to it, and to descend to it, are different things, and suggest different sentiments.</P>
<P>Is the conduct of a war to be trusted to a man who may abhor its principle; who, in every step he
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
takes to render it successful, confirms the power of those by whom he is oppressed? Will foreign States seriously treat with him who has no prerogative of peace or war? No, not so much as in a single vote by himself, or his ministers, or by any one whom he can possibly influence.</P>
<P>Does he <HI>really</HI> name the ministers? they will have a sympathy with him. Are they forced upon him? The whole business between them, and the nominal king will be mutual counteraction. The Ministers of State in France are the only persons in that coun∣try who are incapable of a share in the national coun∣cils. What ministers! what councils! what a nation!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<HEAD>3. <HI>In their Judicature.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As little genius and talent am I able to perceive in the plan of judicature formed by the National As∣sembly. Instead of in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itating your monarchy, and seating your judges on a bench of independence, your object is to reduce them to the most blind obedience. As you have changed all things, you have invented new principles of order. You first appoint judges, who, I suppose, are to determine according to law, and then you let them know, that <HI>at some time or other</HI> you intend to give them some law by which they are to determine. Any studies which they have made (if any they have made) are to be useless to them: they know not by what law they judge, nor under what authority they act, nor by what te∣nure they hold. They thus become complete, and
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
most dangerous instruments in the hands of the go∣verning power, which, in the midst of a cause or on the prospect of it, may wholly change the rule of decision.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>4. <HI>In their Army.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Has more wisdom been displayed in the constitu∣tion of your army, than what is discoverable in your plan of judicature? Truly it is not very easy to di∣vine what that army may become at last. You have got the wolf by the ears, and I wish you joy of the happy position in which you have chosen to place yourselves, and in which you are well circumstanced for a free deliberation, relatively to that army, or to any thing else. You seem to have given the provi∣sional nomination of the officers, in the first instance, to the King, with a reserve of approbation to the National Assembly. This double negotiation for military rank seems to me a contrivance as well adapted, as if it were studied for no other end, to promote faction in the Assembly itself, relative to this vast military patronage; and then to poison the corps of officers with factions of a nature still more dangerous to the safety of government, and destruc∣tive in the end to the efficiency of the army itself. Those officers, who lose the promotions, intended for them by the Crown, must become of a faction opposite to the Assembly. On the contrary, those officers, who carry their point through an interest in the Assembly, must slight in the Crown an autho∣rity
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
which would not advance and could not retard their promotion.</P>
<P>It is besides to be considered, whether an Assem∣bly like yours, is fit for promoting the obedience and discipline of an army. It is known that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedience to any senate or popular authority; and they will least of all yield it to an assembly which is to have a continuance only of two years. In the weakness of one kind of authority and the fluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction, until some popu∣lar General shall draw the eyes of all men upon him∣self. Armies will obey him on his personal account. There is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of thing. But the moment in which that event shall happen, <HI>the person who really com∣mands the army is your master.</HI></P>
<P>How came the Assembly by their present power over the army? Chiefly, to be sure, by debauching the soldiers from their officers. They have begun by a most terrible operation. They have destroyed the principle of obedience; that subordination on which the whole military system depends—the sol∣dier is told, he is a citizen, and has the rights of man and citizen. The right of man, he is told, is to be his own governor, and to be ruled only by those to whom he delegates that self-government. It is very natural he should think, that he ought, most of all, to have his choice where he is to yield the greatest degree of obedience. The Secretary at
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
War informs the Assembly, with affected astonish∣ment, that the regiments pay no regard to oaths. The Assembly then propose—what? more oaths. They renew decrees and proclamations as they ex∣perience their inefficiency, and they multiply oaths in proportion as they weaken, in the minds of men, the sanctions of religion. I hope that handy abridge∣ment of the excellent sermons of Voltaire, d'Alem∣bert, Diderot, and Helvetius, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certain infidel writers.</NOTE> on the immortality of the soul, on a particular superintending Provi∣dence, and on a future state of rewards and punish∣ments, are sent down to the soldiers along with their civic oaths. Of this I have no doubt. All your re∣solutions, all your proceedings, all your debates, all the works of your doctors in religion and politics are put into their hands, and you expect that they will apply to their own case just as much of your doctrines and examples as suits your pleasure. This military aid can only last for a time, whilst the impression of the increase of pay remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all disputes is slattered.</P>
<P>As to the municipal army or militia, which is to balance this national army, that is a monster which, having neither coherency nor connection with the other parts of your system, cannot fail to terminate its perplexed movements in some great national calamity.</P>
<P>Having concluded my few few remarks on the Constitution of the Supreme Power, the Executive, the Judicature, and the Military, I shall say some∣thing of your revenue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5">
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>5. <HI>In their Finance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To fill up all the deficiencies in the old impositions, and the new deficiencies of every kind which were to be expected, what remained to a State without authority? The National Assembly called for a vo∣luntary benevolence. What they obtained was some∣thing more than could be rationally calculated, but what was far, indeed, from answerable to their real necessities, and much less to their fond expectations. At length the mask is thrown off, and they are now trying to exact their benevolence by <HI>force.</HI></P>
<P>The spoil of the church was now become the grand resource of all their operations in finance. Money was no where to be seen. The Minister of Finance reiterated his call for a supply. Thus pressed on all sides, instead of paying the old debt, they con∣tracted a new one, at 3 per cent. creating a new paper currency, called Assignats, founded on an eventual sale of the church lands.</P>
<P>It was found necessary by all, even the most vio∣lent means, to put every individual on the same bottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty interest. In order, therefore, to force the most reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rendered their paper circulation compulsory in all payments. With you a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner with∣out a speculation. What he receives in the morning will not have the same value at night. Industry must wither away. Oeconomy must be driven from your country. Careful provision will have no exis∣tence.
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Who will labour without knowing the amount of his pay? Who will study to increase what none can estimate? Who will accumulate when he does not know the value of what he saves?</P>
<P>The truly melancholy part of thus systematically making a nation of gamesters is this, that <HI>though all are forced to play, few can understand the game.</HI> And I have no doubt, that if this monster of a Con∣stitution can continue, France will be wholly go∣verned by the agitators in corporations, by societies in the towns formed of directors of assignats, and trustees for the sale of church lands, attornies, agents, money-jobbers, speculators, and adventurers, com∣posing an ignoble conspiracy, founded on the de∣struction of the Crown, the Church, the Nobility, and the People.</P>
<P>It is not the confiscation of our church property, from this example in France, that I dread, though I think this would be no trifling evil. The great source of my solicitude is, lest it ever should be con∣sidered in England, as the policy of a State, to seek resource in confiscations <HI>of any kind;</HI> or that any one description of citizens should be brought to regard any of the others as their proper prey. Nations are wading deeper and deeper into an ocean of bound∣less debt. Public debts, which at first were a secu∣rity to Governments by interesting many in the pub∣lic tranquillity, are likely, in their excess, to be∣come the means of their subversion. If Govern∣ments provide for these debts by heavy impositions, they perish by becoming odious to the people: if
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
they do not provide for them, they will be undone by the efforts of the most dangerous of all parties, I mean an extensive, discontented <HI>money interest,</HI> in∣jured, but not destroyed.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III. <HI>The two Parties who have brought about the Re∣volution in that Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Along with the monied interest in France, a new description of men had grown up, with whom that interest soon formed a close and marked union; I mean the political <HI>Men of Letters.</HI> Men of letters, fond of distinguishing themselves, are rarely averse to innovation. This literary cabal had some years ago formed something like a regular plan <HI>for the destruction of the Christian Religion.</HI> What was not to be done towards their great end, by any di∣rect or immediate act, might be wrought by a lon∣ger process through the medium of opinion. The world had done them justice, and in favour of gene∣ral talents, forgave the evil tendency of their pecu∣liar principles. This was true liberality; which they returned, by endeavouring to confine the reputation of sense, learning, and taste, to themselves or their followers. To this system of literary monopoly was joined an unremitting industry to blacken and dis∣credit, in every way, and by every means, all those who did not hold to their faction. To those who have observed the spirit of their conduct, it had been long clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and pen into a persecution which would strike at property, liberty, and life. The issue of the whole was, that what
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
with opposition, and what with success, a violent and malignant zeal of a kind hitherto unknown, took entire possession of their minds. The resources of intrigue were called in, to supply the defects of argument and wit; and as controversial zeal soon turns its thoughts on force, they began to insinuate themselves into a correspondence with foreign princes; in hopes, through their authority, which at first they flattered, to bring about the changes they had in view. The correspondence between this cabal and the late King of Prussia, will throw no small light on their proceedings. For the same purpose for which they intrigued with princes, they cultivated in a distinguished manner the <HI>monied in∣terest</HI> of France.</P>
<P>They who will not believe that the philosophical fanatics who guide in these matters entertain a design of utterly abolishing the Christian religion, whenever the minds of men are prepared for this last stroke against it, by bringing its Ministers into universal contempt, are utterly ignorant of their character and proceedings. These enthusiasts do not scruple to to avow their opinion, that a state can subsist without any Religion better than with one; and that they are able to supply the place of any good which may be in it, by a sort of education, the scheme of which has been long known. Of late they distinguish it by the name of <HI>a Civic Education;</HI> but its tendency is to form a new race of savages in Christian countries.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
As these two kinds of men, <HI>(the literary and mo∣nied interest)</HI> appear principal leaders in all the late transactions, their junction and politics will serve to account for the general fury with which all the land∣ed property of ecclesiastical corporations has been attacked, and the great care, which contrary to their principles has been taken of a monied interest origi∣nating from the authority of the Crown.</P>
<P>We cannot be ignorant of the spirit of atheistical fanaticism, inspired by a multitude of writings, dis∣persed with incredible assiduity and expence, and by sermons delivered in all the streets and places of pub∣lic resort in Paris. These writings and sermons have filled the populace with a black and savage atrocity of mind, which supersedes in them the common feel∣ing of morality and religion.</P>
<P>The spirit of proselytism attends this spirit of fana∣ticism. They have societies to cabal and correspond at home and abroad for the propagation of their te∣nets. The republic of Berne, one of the happiest, the most prosperous, and the best governed coun∣tries upon earth, is one of the great objects, at the destruction of which they aim. I am told they have in some measure succeeded in sowing there the seeds of discontent. They are busy throughout Germany. Spain and Italy have not been untried. <HI>England</HI> is not left out of the comprehensive scheme of their malignant charity; and in England we find those who stretch out their arms to them, who recom∣mend their examples from more than one pulpit, and who choose in more than one periodical meeting, publikly to correspond with them, to applaud them,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
and to hold them up as objects of imitation, who suggest to them leagues of perpetual amity, <HI>at the very time</HI> when the governing powers of their coun∣try may find it expedient <HI>to make war upon them.</HI></P>
<P>In such a state of things, we ought to hold our∣selves upon our guard: the beginnings of confusion with us in England, are at present feeble enough, but whenever our neighbour's house is on fire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV. <HI>The wild notions of their followers in England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On the forenoon of the 4th of November, 1789, Dr. Richard Price, a non-conforming minister of eminence, preached to the above-mentioned Revo∣lution Society, at the dissenting meeting-house in the Old Jewry, a very extraordinary miscellaneous sermon. That sermon is in a strain which, I believe, has not been heard in this kingdom in any of the pulpits which are tolerated and encouraged in it, since the year 1648, when a predecessor of Dr. Price, the Rev. Hugh Peters, made the King's own cha∣pel at St. James's ring with the honour and privi∣lege of the Saints; who, "with the high praises of God in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands, were to execute judgement on the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron." Few harangues from the pulpit ever breathed less of the spirit of moderation, than the lecture in
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
the Old Jewry. Supposing, however, that something like moderation were visible in this political sermon; yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought to be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>1. <HI>Affecting our Civil Constitution.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The doctrines of this political divine affect our Constitution in its vital parts. He asserts that by the principles of the Revolution of 1688, the people of England have acquired three fundamental rights; namely, that we have acquired a right,</P>
<P>1st. To choose our own Governors;</P>
<P>2d. To cashier them for misconduct;</P>
<P>3d. To frame a Government for ourselves.</P>
<P>This new and hitherto unheard-of Bill of Rights, though made in the name of the whole people of England, belongs to these gentlemen, and their faction only. The body of the English nation have no share in it; they utterly disclaim it. They are bound to do so by the laws of their country, made at the time of that very Revolution, which is appealed to by the Society which abuses its name.</P>
<P>If the principles of the Revolution are any where to be found, it is in the Statute called the Declaration of Right. In that most wise, sober, and considerate declaration, drawn up by great Lawyers and great Statesmen, and not by warm and inexperienced en∣thusiasts, not one word is said, nor one suggestion made, of a general right to choose our own gover∣nors.
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
At no time, perhaps, did the sovereign Legis∣lature manifest a more tender regard to that funda∣mental principle of British policy, <HI>an hereditary suc∣cession,</HI> than at the time of the Revolution. The Crown was carried somewhat out of the line in which it had before moved; but the new line was derived from the same stock. It was still a kind of heredi∣tary descent qualified with Protestantism. When the Legislature altered the direction, but kept the principle, they shewed that they held it inviolable. All this precaution proves to a demonstration, how totally adverse the wisdom of the nation was to turn∣ing a case of necessity into a rule of law.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> claim of the Revolution Society is, a right of cashiering our governors for misconduct. No government could stand a moment if it could be blown down with any thing so loose and indefinite as an opinion of misconduct. They who led at the Re∣volution grounded the virtual abdication of King James upon no such light and uncertain principle. They charged him with nothing less than a design to subvert the Protestant Church and State. This was something more than misconduct. Their trust for the future preservation of the State was not in fu∣ture revolutions. The grand policy of all their re∣gulations was to render it almost impracticable for any future Sovereign to compel the States of the kingdom to have again recourse to those violent re∣medies. In order to lighten the Crown they aggra∣vated responsibility on ministers of State: besides, this ceremony of cashiering Kings, of which these
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
gentlemen talk so much at their ease, can rarely, if ever, be performed without force: it then becomes a case of war, and not of Constitution. Government must be abused and deranged indeed, before it can be thought of; then the nature of the disease must in∣dicate the remedy; but with or without right, a Re∣volution will be the very last resource of the think∣ing and the good.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head of right, namely, the Right to form a Government for ourselves, has, at least, as little counterance from any thing done at the Revo∣lution, as the t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o first of their claims. The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now with, to derive all that we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers; well knowing that, without an hereditary government, we can have no hereditary right to any thing. To the people of England, the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of con∣servation, and a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re principle of transmission, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acquisition free; but it secures what it ac∣quires. All the reformations we have hitherto made have proceeded on the principle of reference to an∣tiquity; and I hope, nay, I am persuaded, that all those which possibly may be formed hereafter, will be carefully formed upon analogical precedent, authority, and example.</P>

<HEAD>2. <HI>The Rights of Men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But it is in vain to talk to these gentlemen of authority and example. They have a mine that will blow up at one gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d explosion all precedents, charters, and Acts of Parliament. They have the <HI>"rights of men."</HI> Against these, their rights of men, let no government look for security in the length of its continuance, or in the justice and lenity of its ad∣ministration. The objections of these speculatists, if its forms do not quadrate with their theories, are as valid against such an old and beneficial government, as against the most violent tyranny or the greenest usurpation.</P>
<P>Far am I from denying in theory; full as far is my heart from withholding in practice, (if I were of power to give or withhold) the <HI>real</HI> rights of men. In denying their false claims, I do not mean to injure those which are real, and which are such as their pretended rights would totally de∣stroy. By having a right to every thing, men want every thing. Government is a contrivance of hu∣man wisdom to provide for human wants. Among these wants is to be reckoned a want, out of civil so∣ciety, of a sufficient restraint upon their passions. This can only be done by a power out of themselves; and not in the exercise of its functions, subject to that will, and those passions which it is its office to bridle and subdue. But as the liberties and restric∣tions vary with times and circumstances, and admit of infinite modifications, they are not to be settled
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
upon any abstract rule; and it is as foolish to discuss them upon that principle, as it would be to discuss a man's abstract right to food and to medicine.</P>

<HEAD>3 <HI>The common feelings of humanity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The worst of these politics of revolution is this, they temper and harden the breast, in order to prepare it for the desperate strokes which are some∣times used in extreme occasions.</P>
<P>This sort of people are so taken up with their theories about the <HI>Rights</HI> of man, that they have to∣tally forgot his <HI>nature.</HI> The famous sermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but this spirit through the whole of it. Plots, massacres, assassinations, seem to some people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution. The preacher found them all in the French Revolution; his enthusiasm kindles as he advances, and when he arrives at his peroration, he breaks out into the following rapture:</P>
<P><Q>“What an eventful period is this! I am happy that I have lived to see it. I could almost say, <HI>Lord, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</HI> I have lived to see a diffusion of knowledge, which has under∣minded superstition and error. I have lived to see thirty millions of people, indignant and resolute, spurning at slavery, and demanding liberty with an irresistible voice; their King led in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch surrendering himself to his subjects.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
Before I proceed farther, I have to remark, that Dr. Price seems rather to over value the great acqui∣sitions of light which he has obtained and diffused in this age. The last century had, though in a different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr. Price. On the trial of the Rev. Hugh Peters for high trea∣son, it was deposed, that when King Charles was brought to London for his trial, the apostle of liberty in that day conducted the triumph. <HI>"I saw,"</HI> says the witness, <HI>his Majesty in the coach with six horses, and Peters riding before the King triumphing.</HI> Dr. Price, when he talks as if he had made a discovery, only follows a precedent; for after the commence∣ment of the King's trial, this same Dr. Peters, con∣cluding a long prayer at the Royal Chapel at White∣hall, (he had very triumphantly chosen his place) said, "I have prayed and preached these twenty∣years, and now I may say, with old Simeon, <HI>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."</HI> Peters had not the fruits of his prayer, for he neither departed so soon as he wished, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily hope none of his followers may be in this country) himself a sacrifice to the triumph he led as pontiff.</P>
<P>I find a preacher of the gospel, profaning the beau∣tiful and prophetic ejaculation, commonly called, <HI>"nunc dimittis,"</HI> made on the first presentation of our Saviour in the temple, and applying it with unnatu∣ral rapture to the most horrid, atrocious, and afflicting spectacle, that ever was exhibited to the pity and in∣dignation
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
of mankind. This <HI>leading in triumph,</HI> (a thing in its best form humanly and irreligious) which fills our preacher with such un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allowed trans∣ports, must shock, I believe, the moral taste of every well-born mind. Several English were the stupified and indignant spectators of that triumph. It was (unless we have been strangely deceived) a spectacle more resembling a procession of American savages, entering into Onondaga, after some of their murders, called victories, and leading into hovels hung round with scalps, their captives overpowered with the scolds and buffets of women as ferocious as them∣selves, much more than it resembled the triumphal pomp of a civilized nation.—If a civilized nation, or any man who had a sense of generosity, were capa∣ble of a personal triumph over the fallen and afflic∣ted.</P>

<HEAD>4. <HI>Our Religious Establishment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>At first I was at a loss to account for this fit of unguarded transport, till I recollected the Io Paean of this memorable triumph; I mean the ani∣mating cry which called for <HI>all the bishops to be hanged on the lamp-posts.</HI></P>
<P>However, the cabals here, who take a sort of share in your transactions, are yet but a handful of people. In England, most of us conceive that it is <HI>envy and mali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aity,</HI> and not a love of the self-denial and mor∣tification of the ancient church, which makes some look askance at the distinctions, and honours, and re∣venues, which, taken from no person, are set apart
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
for learning and virtue. The ears of the people of England are distinguishing; they hear these men speak broad. Their tongues betray them. Their language is the cant and gibberish of hypocrisy. The people of England must think so, when these praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive evan∣gelic poverty, and which in the spirit, ought always to exist in them, but in the thing must be varied, when manners, when modes of life, when indeed the whole order of human affairs, has undergone a total revolution.</P>
<P>Besides the body of the English nation know, and what is better, feel inwardly, that religion is the basis of civil society.</P>
<P>If our religious tenets should ever want a farther elucidation, we shall not call on <HI>atheism</HI> to explain them. If our ecclesiastical establishment should want revision, it is not <HI>avar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e or rapa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iry,</HI> public or private, that we shall employ for the audit, receipt, or application of its consecrated revenue.</P>
<P>It is from their attachment to a church establish∣ment, that the English nation did not think it wise to entrust that great fundamental interest to the unsteady and precarious contribution of individuals. They go further; they certainly never have suffered, and never will suffer the fixed estate of the church to be con∣verted into <HI>a pension,</HI> to depend on the treasury, and to be delayed, withheld, or perhaps extinguished, by difficulties which may be pretended for political pur∣poses, and are in fact, often brought on by the extra∣vagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians. The people of England think they have constitutional
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
motives, as well as religious, for not turning their in∣dependent clergy into pensioners of state. They tremble for their liberty from the influence of a clergy dependent on the crown; they tremble for the pub∣lic tranquillity from the disorders of a factious clergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the crown. They, therefore, made their church, like their king and nobility, independent.</P>
<P>On these ideas, instead of quarrelling with esta∣blishments, as some do, who have made a philosophy and religion of their hostility to them, we cleave closely to them. <HI>Church and State</HI> are ideas inse∣parable in our minds; and scarcely is the one men∣tioned without mentioning the other. We are re∣solved to keep an established Church; an established monarchy; an established aristocracy; an established democracy.</P>

<HEAD>V. <HI>The true policy of this country at the present juncture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On the whole; I wish my countrymen rather to recommend to our neighbours the example of the British Constitution, than to take models from them for the improvement of our own. In the former, they have got an invaluable treasure. I would not ex∣clude alteration neither; but even when I changed, it should be to preserve. In what I did, I would follow the example of our ancestors. I would make the reparation, as nearly as possible, in the style of the building. A politic caution, a guarded circum∣cumspection, a moral, rather than a complexional
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
timidity, were among the ruling principles of our forefathers, in their most decided conduct. Let us imitate their caution, if we wish to deserve their for∣tune, or to retain their bequests. Let us <HI>add,</HI> if we please; but let us <HI>preserve</HI> what they have left; and, standing on firm ground, let us be satisfied to admire, rather than attempt to follow, in their despe∣rate flights, the aeronauts of France.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI. <HI>Conclusion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I have little to recommend my opinions, but long observation and much impartiality. They come from one who wishes to preserve consistency; but who would preserve consistency by <HI>varying his means to secure the unity of his end:</HI> and, when the vessel in which he sails may be endangered, by over∣loading it on one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight of his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise.</P>
