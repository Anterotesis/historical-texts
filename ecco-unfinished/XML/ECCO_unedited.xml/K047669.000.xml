<HEAD>AARON HILL.</HEAD>
<P>HE who can survey the recorded life of this gentle∣man, without exultation, must be dead to virtue; He, who is not proud of the lustre it reflects upon his species, feels nothing of the enthusiasm that warms into kindred excellence.</P>
<P>AARON HILL was a native of the Capital, and born in Beaufort-Buildings, Strand, on the 10th of February, 1684-5. Paternally, his exemplar was a bad one, for his father GEORGE HILL, Esq. was lavish and indiscreet, and the legal right to a property of 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year, which would have de∣volved upon him, his Father so involved as to ren∣der it of no value to the family.</P>
<P>THE young gentleman, however <HI>thus</HI> unfor∣tunate, was well gifted other ways; he was adorned by much mental power, and promptitude that carried that power to the best account—his mind was formed for enterprize, inventive and indefati∣gable. He had scarcely gone through Westminster, and completed his 14th year, when he sought
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
after fortune in other climes, and surely with a sufficient disregard of distance, for he undertook a voyage to <HI>Constantinople</HI>.—His expected advance∣ment was baffled by a mean woman as far as was pecuniary, but the advancement in the best know∣ledge, the <HI>savoir vivre</HI>, he who mix'd so much with variety of character, and possess'd the mind of AARON HILL, could not but find a commodity readily convertible into wealth.</P>
<P>FEW men have been more multifarious in pur∣suit than this—For HE made <HI>plays</HI>, who could also make <HI>Beech oil</HI>. Among his struggles after pre∣eminence he sought to rival the Russians in <HI>Pot∣ashes</HI>—and the Highlander first ventured down the Spey upon <HI>Floats</HI> at the suggestion and example of HILL.—He cut down forests of timber that JOHNSON could never have discovered, and shewed the English builder, that Scottish timber was per∣fectly applicable to ship-building.—He was occu∣pied at once by the cultivation of the art of acting, and that of planting, and his imagination vibrated between South Carolina and the Theatre in the Haymarket.</P>
<P>HILL was one of those with whom POPE com∣menced a war, that dishonoured his great talents
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
—For something, or for nothing, he made HILL dive, and arise without spot from the mud of dul∣ness; and the retort of HILL should be remembered as the keenest characteristic of POPE'S literary life.</P>
<Q><L>Tuneful ALEXIS, on the Thames' fair side,</L>
<L>The ladies' <HI>play-thing</HI>, and the muses' pride,</L>
<L>With merit popular, with wit polite,</L>
<L>Easy though vain, and elegant though light,</L>
<L>Desiring and <HI>deserving</HI> others praise,</L>
<L>Poorly accepts a fame he ne'er repays:</L>
<L>Unborn to cherish, SNEAKINGLY APPROVES,</L>
<L>And wants the soul to <HI>spread</HI> the worth he <HI>loves</HI>.</L></Q>
<P>I HAVE little more to add to this mention, but that in marriage he was happy, and he deserved his happiness;—he was studious, and his labour was not in vain; he attracted the love of man, and it is imagined lived strictly that life which he believed most acceptable to GOD.—Active useful∣ness attended him till he died, this happened in 1750. The shock of the great earthquake im∣mediately preceded a shock to him fatal.</P>
<P>HE died in his 65th year, and was interred in the same grave with his lady in Westminster Ab∣bey. His dramatic pieces are the following:

<HEAD>ZARA.</HEAD>
<P>IF it were merely from the ground-work of the Piece that this Play should be estimated, much of our Admiration would abate—Religious Differences are now neither felt with that Horror, nor do they, thank Heaven, produce now the Miseries that Bi∣gotry and Ignorance formerly originated.</P>
<P>BUT ZARA has other and strong Claims—from the natural delineation of the Passions. M. VOLTAIRE was the Original Author, but even his Play is an <HI>English</HI> one, and the French Stage grew animated by the Transfusion of the manly Energy of Shakspeare. The present is obviously an elegant liberal Transla∣tion from the ZAIRE of Voltaire, with some trivial Alterations of Names and Sentiments.</P>
<P><HI>In this Piece Mrs.</HI> CIBBER <HI>made her Theatrical dêbut in the Character of Zara</HI>.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="12"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Beauties of <HI>Nature</HI> will be Beauties <HI>everlastingly</HI>.— If they are, sometimes, <HI>eclipsed</HI> by a Cloud of ill Accidents, they <HI>disperse</HI> the dark <HI>Screen</HI>; and, again, become amiable.</P>
<P>BUT, unwilling to suppose, we are, <HI>now</HI>, under Influence of such a <HI>Cloud</HI>, with regard to <HI>Dramatical Taste</HI>, I thought it more decent, (and <HI>juster</HI>) to charge its Degeneracy to the STAGE, than to the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Nation.</P>
<P>ACCOUNTING in this Manner for the <HI>Defect</HI>, I have often taken Pleasure, (when turning my Search towards a <HI>Remedy</HI>) to consider it, as no improbable Hope, that YOUNG <HI>Actors</HI> and <HI>Actresses</HI>, beginning, <HI>unseduced</HI> by AFFECTED EXAMPLES, might go some Length, towards what has been said of a cele∣brated Writer—
<Q>"Who reach'd <HI>Perfection,</HI> in his <HI>first Essay</HI>."</Q></P>
<P>IT required, methought, but the Assistance of a lively <HI>Ima∣gination</HI>, joined to an easy, and natural <HI>Power</HI>; with a reso∣lute <HI>Habitude</HI>, to BE, for an Hour or two, the very Persons they would <HI>seem</HI>.—Such a <HI>Foundation</HI> for accomplished Acting, lies so open, and so clearly <HI>in Nature</HI>, that they, who find it at all, <HI>must</HI> discover it at <HI>first:</HI> Because, when Men are once got <HI>out of the Road</HI>, they, who travel the <HI>farthest</HI>, have but most Length of Way to ride <HI>back</HI> again.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>YET, the Interested in Playhouses were so positive in the contrary Sentiment, that they submitted to reverence, as a <HI>Maxim</HI>, this extraordinary Concession, "That <HI>Actors must be twenty Years such, before they can expect to be Masters of the Air, and Tread of the Stage</HI>."</P>
<P>NOW, there is but <HI>one</HI> View, in Nature, wherein I was wil∣ling to admit of this Argument: I was forced to <HI>confess</HI>, I had seen some <HI>particular</HI> Stage Airs, and Stage Treads, which a Man of good Sense <HI>might</HI>, indeed, waste a long Life, in endea∣vouring to imitate, and, <HI>at last, lose his Labour!</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, since an Opinion, in Opposition to these Gen∣tlemen's, wanted Weight to make That believed <HI>possible</HI>, which had not, yet, been reduced into <HI>Practice</HI>, I took a sudden Re∣solution, actually to try, WHO <HI>was in the Right</HI>, by attempt∣ing the EXPERIMENT.—This, I know, was a design, which, succeeding, would not fail to give Pleasure to the <HI>Public</HI>; and, which, <HI>miscarrying</HI>, could produce no worse Consequence, than <HI>my</HI> particular Mortification.</P>
<P>I imagined it reasonable to found a Trial, of this Nature, rather on a <HI>New</HI> Play, than an <HI>Old</HI> one: And, as it ought to be a Play of unquestionable <HI>Merit</HI>, it must have been Presump∣tion, and Vanity, to have cast a Thought toward any Thing, <HI>of my own</HI>.—Upon the Whole, that I might keep out of the Reach either of Prejudice, or Partiality, a <HI>Foreign</HI> Production seemed the properest Choice; and the ZAIRE, of <HI>Monsieur de Voltaire</HI>, offered me every thing that Nature could do, on the Part of the <HI>Poet:</HI> But, I had still something to <HI>wish</HI>, with regard to that <HI>other</HI> Part of her Influence, which depended on the <HI>Player</HI>.</P>
<P>I had (of late) among the rest of the Town, been deprived of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ational Pleasure from the Theatre, by a monstrous and un∣moving
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
<HI>Affectation:</HI> Which, choaking up the Avenues to <HI>Passion</HI>, had made <HI>Tragedy</HI> FORBIDDING, and HORRIBLE!</P>
<P>I was despairing to see a <HI>Correction</HI> of this Folly; when I found myself unexpectedly re-animated, by the War which the PROMPTER has proclaimed, and is now weekly waging against the <HI>Ranters</HI> and <HI>Whiners</HI> of the Theatre; after having under∣taken to reduce the <HI>Actor's lost Art</HI>, into PRINCIPLES, with Design, by reconciling them to the touching and spirited <HI>Me∣dium</HI>, to reform those <HI>wild Copies</HI> of Life, into some <HI>Resem∣blance</HI> at least of their <HI>Originals</HI>.</P>
<P>THUS, <HI>confirmed</HI> in my Sentiments, I ventured on the <HI>Cast</HI> of two <HI>Capital</HI> Characters, into Hands, <HI>not disabled</HI>, by Custom and obstinate Prejudice, from pursuing the <HI>Plain Tract of</HI> NATURE.</P>
<P>IT was easy to induce OSMAN, (as he is a Relation of my own, and <HI>but too fond</HI> of the Amusement,) to make Trial <HI>how far</HI> his Delight in an Art I shall never allow him to <HI>practise</HI>, might enable him to supply <HI>one</HI> Part of the Proof, that, to <HI>imi∣tate Nature</HI>, we must proceed <HI>upon Natural Principles</HI>.</P>
<P>AT the same Time, it happened, that Mrs. CIBBER was fortunately inclinable to exert her inimitable Talents, in <HI>addi∣tional</HI> Aid of my Purpose, with View to <HI>continue</HI> the <HI>Practice</HI> of a Profession, for which her <HI>Person</HI>, her <HI>Voice</HI>, the unaffected <HI>Sensibility</HI> of her <HI>Heart</HI>, (and her <HI>Face</HI>, so finely disposed for <HI>assuming</HI> and <HI>expressing</HI> the PASSIONS) have so naturally quali∣fied her.</P>
<P>AND, to give this bold <HI>Novelty of Design</HI> all its necessary Furtherance, Mr. FLEETWOOD, who professes the most gene∣rous Inclinations for <HI>Improvement</HI> of his troublesome Province, very willingly <HI>concurred</HI> in whatever could, on <HI>his</HI> Part, be of Use to the <HI>Experiment</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="15"/>BEHOLD, in this little <HI>Detail</HI>, from <HI>what Motive</HI> I have taken upon me to throw one of the finest of <HI>French</HI> Plays upon the Public.—If my Expectations are not strangely <HI>deceived</HI>, it will be found, by the <HI>Event</HI>, whether our <HI>Taste</HI> for <HI>true</HI> Tra∣gedy is <HI>declined</HI>; or the true <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>acting</HI> it <HI>forgotten</HI>.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>First</HI> I can have nothing to conclude, but that my Judgment has been <HI>weak</HI>, and <HI>mistaken</HI>.</P>
<P>BUT, if the <HI>Last</HI> proves the Case, I shall flatter myself, that those Persons of Quality, from whose <HI>imaginary Want of Discernment</HI> some People have not <HI>blushed</HI> to DERIVE their <HI>dull</HI> Qualities, will, in Right of their <HI>insulted Understanding</HI>, EXACT, for the future, a warm and toilsome Exertion, of the <HI>Strong</HI> and the <HI>Natural</HI>, though at the COST of the <HI>Lazy</HI> and <HI>Affected</HI>.</P>
<P>THIS would awaken, at once, the <HI>Reflection</HI> of many, who have it in their POWER to be moving, and natural Actors; and, by effectually <HI>convincing</HI> them, that their present Opinion is <HI>wrong</HI>, bring 'em over (for their own, and the Public Ad∣vantage) to embrace and succeed by a <HI>New</HI> one.</P>
<P>SUCH a Step towards <HI>reforming</HI> the Theatre, would draw on, (as a Consequence) many of its <HI>nobler</HI> Improvements—For, where <HI>Emotions</HI> are keenest, the <HI>Delight</HI> becomes greatest; and to whatever <HI>most charms</HI>, we most closely <HI>adhere</HI>, and encou∣rage it <HI>most actively</HI>.</P>
<P>IF, in translating this excellent Tragedy, I have regarded in some Places the <HI>Soul</HI>, and in others the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Original, <HI>Monsieur de Voltaire</HI>, who has made himself a very capable <HI>Judge</HI> both of our <HI>Language</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI>, will indulge me that Latitude; except he should, in observing some <HI>Alterations</HI> I have made, in his Names and his <HI>Diction</HI>, forget that their <HI>Motives</HI> are to be found in the Turn of our National <HI>Differ∣ence</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>After what I have said of the Playhouses, it would be Injus∣tice not to <HI>declare</HI>, that I exclude from the Censure of speaking or acting <HI>unnaturally</HI>, any one of the Persons who have been cast into ZARA.—And in particular, I must say <HI>This</HI> of TWO of them; that <HI>Mr.</HI> MILWARD, who is already a very <HI>excellent</HI>, and hourly rising to be an <HI>accomplished</HI> Actor, has a VOICE that both comprehends, and expresses, <HI>the utmost Com∣pass of</HI> HARMONY.—And <HI>Mr.</HI> CIBBER discerningly pursued through the numberless <HI>Extent</HI> of his <HI>Walks</HI>, is an Actor of as <HI>unlimitted a Compass of</HI> GENIUS, as ever I saw on the Stage; and is <HI>barely</HI> received, as he <HI>deserves</HI>, when the Town is <HI>most favourable</HI>.</P>

<L>IT moves my wonder, young and beauteous Zara,</L>
<L>Whence these new sentiments inspire your heart!</L>
<L>Your peace of mind increases with your charms;</L>
<L>Tears now no longer shade your eyes soft lustre:</L>
<L>You meditate no more those happy climes</L>
<L>To which Nerestan will return to guide you.</L>
<L>You talk no more of that gay nation now,</L>
<L>Where men adore their wives, and woman's power</L>
<L>Draws rev'rence from a polish'd people's softness:</L>
<L>Their husbands' equals, and their lovers' queens!</L>
<L>Free without scandal; wise without restraint;</L>
<L>"Their virtue due to nature, not to fear."</L>
<L>Why have you ceas'd to wish this happy change?</L>
<L>A barr'd seraglio!—sad, unsocial life!</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HERE, take a surfeit, Sirs, of being jealous,</L>
<L>And shun the pains that plague those Turkish fellows:</L>
<L>Where love and death join hands, their darts confounding:</L>
<L>Save us, good Heaven, from this new way of wounding.</L>
<L>Curs'd climate! where to cards a lone-left woman</L>
<L>Has only one of her black guards to summon!</L>
<L>Sighs, and sits mop'd, with her tame beast to gaze at:</L>
<L>And that cold treat, is all the game she plays at!</L>
<L>For, should she once some abler hand be trying,</L>
<L>Poniard's the word! and the first deal is—dying!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Slife! shou'd the bloody whim get ground in Britain,</L>
<L>Where woman's freedom has such heights to sit on;</L>
<L>Dagger, provok'd, would bring on desolation:</L>
<L>And murder'd belles unpeople half the nation!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fain would I hope this play, to move compassion;</L>
<L>And live to hunt suspicion out of fashion.—</L>
<L>Four motives strongly recommend the lover's</L>
<L>Hate of this weakness that our scene discovers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First then —A woman will, or won't—depend on't:</L>
<L>If she will do't, she will:—and, there's an end on't.</L>
<L>But, if she won't—since safe and sound your trust is,</L>
<L>Fear is affront: and jealousy injustice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
<L>Next,—he who bids his dear do what she pleases,</L>
<L>Blunts wedlock's edge; and all its torture eases:</L>
<L>For—not to feel your suff'rings, is the same,</L>
<L>As not to suffer:—All the diff'rence—name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thirdly—The jealous husband wrongs his honour;</L>
<L>No wife goes lame, without some hurt upon her:</L>
<L>And the malicious world will still be guessing,</L>
<L>Who oft dines out, dislikes her own cook's dressing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fourth, and lastly,—to conclude my lecture,</L>
<L>If you would fix the inconstant wife—respect her.</L>
<L>She who perceives her virtues over-rated,</L>
<L>Will fear to have the account more justly stated:</L>
<L>And borrowing, from her pride, the good wife's seeming,</L>
<L>Grow really such—to merit your esteeming.</L>

<L>Who would break it, when summon'd by you?</L>

<L>What it is you are summon'd to do?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>He.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Not a word—but expected to see</L>
<L>Something new in the musical way.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>She.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Why, this author has cast you and me,</L>

<L>What then is its tuneful name,</L>

<L>Has he built into tra-ge-dy?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>She.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Tho' he rails against songs, he thought fit,</L>
<L>Most gravely to urge and implore us,</L>
<L>In aid of his tragical wit,</L>
<L>To erect ourselves into a Chorus?
<STAGE><HI>Laughing.</HI></STAGE></L>

<SPEAKER><HI>He.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>A Chorus! what's that—a composing</L>

<L>No—he hinders the boxes from dozing,</L>
<L>By mixing some spirit with sadness.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>He.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>So then—'tis our task, I suppose,</L>
<L>To sing sober sense into relish.</L>
<L>Strike up, at each tragical close,</L>
<L>And unheeded moral embellish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>She.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas the custom, you know, once in Greece,</L>
<L>And if here 'tis not witty, 'tis new.</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>She.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>If there's ought to be learnt from the play,</L>
<L>I shall sit in a nook, here, behind,</L>
<L>Popping out in the good ancient way,</L>
<L>Now and then, with a piece of my mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>But suppose, that no moral should rise,</L>
<L>Worth the ears of the brave or the fair!</L>

<L>To baulk a rais'd hope is a cowardly sin!</L>

<L>Pray how does it happen, that passion so gay,</L>
