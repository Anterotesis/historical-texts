<P>I am but a poor country girl, Sir; my name is Lilla; but I love Leopold, and Leopold loves me, yet my cross ill-natur'd brother wants me to refuse Leopold, to marry that ugly old miser Yuseph, a justice of peace in our village.</P>

<P>Colonel Cohenberg!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Anselm!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What cou'd induce you, colonel, to trust yourself so far within the enemy's camp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Two powerful motives, my Anselm, love and glory. Our general means to attack this post to night, and I am honour'd with the command of the detachment —will the villagers assist us, think ye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Assist ye! aye, colonel, to the last drop of our blood, every man of us. We have groan'd under Turkish oppression too long—but you mention'd the word love, colonel, may I venture to enquire after the fair Katharine whom I saw at Vienna last year?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Adorable girl! she had just consented to be mine, when I was suddenly order'd to the Siege of Belgrade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That was unlucky—how did she bear the news?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Like a heroine: when I attempted a faultering adieu; what, says she, will you now refuse the hand you have so often solicited? shou'd the bitter hour of misfor∣tune o'ertake you, my Cohenberg, you will need the consolation of friendship; and have you a dearer friend than your Katharine?—I will go with you, and shall find my happiness in fulfilling the duties of a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You married her then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but was immediately obliged to join my regiment.—How shall I speak the remainder of our me∣lancholy story?—She attempted to follow me, but was taken prisoner by a straggling party of the Turkish army, just arrived to the relief of Belgrade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then I fear she is taken to the Seraskier's seraglio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I dread; in what part of the camp is his seraglio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You may have observed, about two miles from hence, a convent almost in ruins, which he has converted into his seraglio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am not personally known to the Seraskier. By pretending business to him, I may easily gain admit∣tance to his presence. I have prepared two letters, one to the Seraskier in my own name, another to my Katha∣rine, informing her of my design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And if you find her there, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What then! why then I'll storm the Seraskier's tent, and carry her off this night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven prosper you, 'tis a hazardous enter∣prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hazardous, my Anselm! I scorn the thought, I have pick'd the gallant fellows whom I command, my brave Hussars, the flower of the Austrian army; we have fought, we have bled, we have conquered toge∣ther; and that leader hazards little who has thought it his first duty to treat his soldiers as his friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Anselm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But you know, colonel, friends in all situa∣tions will sometimes desert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Col.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am not speaking of the weathercock friendship that only shews which way the wind of caprice points. We have tried each other in adversity and prosperity, and have cemented our friendship with our blood on the field of battle—but come, lead me to the Seraskier—be diligent, confident, and secret:
