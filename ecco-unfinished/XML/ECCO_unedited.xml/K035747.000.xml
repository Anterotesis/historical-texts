<P>THE EPHESIAN MATRON.</P>
<P>A COMIC SERENATA, After the Manner of the <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>AS IT IS PERFORMED AT RANELAGH HOUSE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are acquainted with Italian musical compositions, must know that there are among them many short comic dramas, (a longer sort of cantatas) where little fables are pursued; such as La Serva Padrona, Baioco e Serpilla, Lo Maestro di Cappella, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has been suggested to the managers of RANELAGH, by a gentleman long presiding with unrival'd talents, over the most ca∣pital of our public entertainments; that something in the same way wou'd be an improvement upon the detached songs and ballads, usually sung in their orchestra. In deference to his judgment, this is an Essay.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
It would be needless to observe that the words are to be no farther consider'd than as they are adapted, and serve to give stile and character to the music. But should▪ the music, when it has been suffi∣ciently heard to render it some what fa∣miliar, be found pleasing enough to make the entertainment, on the whole, agreeable to the public, other pieces may be written much more pardonable, than what has here, at a short warning, been in great haste put together.</P>

<L>Daughter, e'er this, I thought you dead;</L>

<L>Thus, old wits, in wicked satires,</L>
