<HEAD>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
CONTINUATION
OF THE
MEMOIRS
OF
MISS SIDNEY BIDULPH.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of the former part of these memoirs
having been extremely sollicited by many people,
to procure, if possible, a further account of Mrs. Ar∣nold
and her family, would gladly have gratified the
curiosity of his readers, if after having left so melan∣choly
an impression on the minds of the tender and
humane, he could, in the succeeding part of the hi∣story,
have thrown in some rays of sunshine, to
brighten the prospect, before he dropped the curtain over
so gloomy a scene; but as that satisfaction is not per∣mitted
him, the only reflection that could enable him
to pursue with any alacrity the thread of this affecting
story, was, that the principal person concerned in
it, is long since at peace, and in possession of the
rewards which were denied to her virtue and her suf∣ferings
here.</P>
<P>The gentleman by whose means I was favoured with
the first part of this history, told me upon my re-urging
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
my enquiries after some farther lights into it, that as all
the events which occurred even after the close of his
mother's narrative had happened when he was in his
early infancy, he could give me very little information
about them: he only knew in general that some very
distressful incidents had succeeded in Mrs. Arnold's life
after that period: he added that his mother never cared
to speak on the subject, which had prevented his asking
her any particulars; but that he recollected to have
heard her say, that she believed Patty Main, the young
woman who formerly waited on Mrs. Arnold, was in
possession of some papers which contained the whole
story. I asked him if this gentlewoman were still liv∣ing,
and where she was to be found; he told me she
had married a gentleman of the name of Askham, who
had an estate in Oxfordshire: but whether she, or any
of her family, were now in being he could not inform
me.</P>
<P>Upon so slender a hope as this of recovering the
remainder of so interesting a story, I took a journey
into Oxfordshire; where I soon learnt that Mrs. Askham
and her husband had both been dead many years; but
that they had left three daughters, amongst whom (as
they had no son) their father's estate of about six
hundred pounds a year, had been equally divided.
The two eldest were settled in a different part of the
country; but the youngest who was her mother's fa∣vourite,
having married unhappily a man who squan∣dered
her little fortune was now a widow, and residing
in the city of Oxford. The persons from I had this
account, added, that she kept a haberdasher's shop, and
as she had two or three children, they believed she was
in streightened circumstances.</P>
<P>To this person therefore I applied, and easily intro∣duced
myself by buying some of the goods in which
she dealt. I found her a modest sensible woman, who
seemed with great industry to apply herself to a little
calling for the subsistance of her family; at the same
same time I could easily discover that her education had
qualified her to appear in a much better sphere.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
After I had, by two or three visits, made myself a
little acquainted with her, I took occasion one day to
ask her, whether she had ever heard her mother talk of
Mrs. Arnold? She seemed startled at the question: Be
nor alarm'd Madam, said I, at my enquiry, the part
that Mrs Askham bore in the history of that unfortu∣nate
lady will always do honour to her memory. I am
surprized, Sir, replied she, how Mrs. Arnold's story
came to be published; for tho' the names are all changed,
I was too well acquainted with the characters of every
person concerned in it, not to know for whom they
were intended. I then told her without reserve that I
myself had been the editor, and the means by which I
had got possession of the manuscript; acquainting her
at the same time that I had learnt from the son of Mrs.
Cecilia B—that Mrs. Askham had had some papers
containing very interesting particulars; and that if they
still remained in the family, I should look upon it as a
singular favour if she would procure me a fight of them.
She told me she had them herself; but that as she should
be very unwilling to part with them, she hoped I would
excuse her not giving them out of her hands; but that
to oblige me I should be very welcome to peruse them
at her house, which she said I could do in two or
three mornings, if I would take the trouble to call.</P>
<P>I thanked her for this permission, and accordingly
waited on her the next morning; when I found her
busied in ranging the papers in order on a table in her
dining-room. Here, Sir, said she on my entering, you
will find your curiosity fully gratified. These are
copies of letters which passed between the several per∣sons
concerned in the story they contain: they are all
in my mother's hand-writing, who as she was in Mrs.
Arnold's confidence to her last hour, wrote them out
with the permission of the family, in order, as she has
often told me, to preserve from oblivion the memory
of so many uncommon events crowded into one life,
and to leave the whole as a useful lesson to her children.
I was the child she most loved, and she left these papers
to me at her death. You will find in this parcel, con∣tinued
she (pointing to a large packet which lay by
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
itself) the former part of Mrs. Arnold's history, carried
down to that period at which she retired from London
on the news of Mr. Falkland's death; 'tis drawn up in
a concise manner by my mother herself; if you are
desirous to re-peruse this part of her story, I will leave
it with you. I told her as I was already acquainted
with Mrs. Arnold's history down to that aera, I had no
curiosity to examine that packet; upon which she locked
it up in a scrutoire which stood in the room, and left
me to the perusal of the others.</P>
<P>In three mornings I accomplished my task; and hav∣ing
expressed my acknowledgments to the owner for
the entertainment these letters had afforded me, I frankly
proposed the purchasing them from her, as I thought
her situation in life would prevent her taking offence at
such a proposal. She seemed at first very unwilling to
part with them; but after urging a good many ar∣guments,
together with the offer of a very handsome
gratuity, she at last consented; and I had the satisfac∣tion
to carry away with me the remaining part of Mrs.
Arnold's history, which the following sheets contain.</P>
<P>The letters which passed between Mrs. Arnold and
her friend Mrs. Cecilia B—for the first eight or nine
years after the final departure of the former from Lon∣don,
contain nothing material to the ens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing story.
The melancholy state of Mrs. Arnold's mind gave a
gloomy cast to most of those which were written by
her in the first two or three years of this period: her pa∣tience
and her fortitude seemed at length in a great mea∣sure
to have subdued her grief, at least they taught her
to suppress any expressions of it in her letters to her
friend; and as the sad cause became less and less re∣cent,
she appears by degrees to wear off in some mea∣sure
the impressions of her sorrow. The only events
that the editor could gather from a series of letters du∣ring
this interval, was the marriage of Patty Main to
Mr. Askham; the death of Mr. Warner; who after
having purchased a considerable estate in Oxfordshire
(with a handsome house which he called Woodberry)
left it to Mrs. Arnold, and appears to have died two
years before the date of the first letter in this collec∣tion:
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and it seems to be much about the same time that
Mrs. Arnold removed from her former dwelling in
Buckinghamshire and came to settle in this near Oxford,
with a view to be near young Falkland, whom she pur∣posed
to enter in that university. He learn'd also from
these letters that lady V—had undertaken a journey
from Lancashire on purpose to visit Mrs Arnold, and
had passed a whole summer with her; and it appears
that Mrs. Cecilia B—had generally paid her friend a
visit once a year.</P>
<P>In order therefore to take up the narrative as near
as possible to that aera where Cecilia breaks off her's,
he has suppressed all the preceding letters, and com∣mences
this collection with that which seems, if not
immediately necessary, at least most pertinent to the
following story, as it gives occasion to Cecilia's reply,
which throws considerable lights on it. The editor has
here and there only given extracts from letters, the
remainder of which were foreign to his purpose; and
has sometimes even ventured to throw in little nar∣ratives,
the circumstances of which he collected from
a variety of letters, containing several other things,
and therefore too long and too immaterial, to be insert∣ed
here.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THANK you, thank you, my dear, for delivering
me so speedily from my fears. And so this frightful
alarm has ended at last in a friendly fit of the gout! I
congratulate Mr. B. upon it; yet I wish the disorder had
been so complaisant as to have settled in his foot, before
it attacked his stomach; and the good man now truly
can't part with his nurse, but tell him I shall think
him a very tyrant, if he does not let you down to me
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
again, as soon as he grows a little better. Here it was
<HI>two</HI> years since your last visit to me, yon were but
twelve hours in my house, (seven of which you were
asleep) when slap comes down an express to hurry you
away to Mr. B—, who took into his head forsooth that
he was dying! Oh these men, Cecilia, are so pusillani∣mous
when any thing ails them!—then it is (tho' per∣haps
they never discovered it before) that they find the
comfort of a good wife. Pray ask him, my dear, who but
yourself would fit whole days stifling in a room like a
hot-house, to hear him snarling in his elbow-chair? He
must think me very sawcy for talking thus of one
with whom I am so little acquainted; but is not that his
own fault? How often have I pressed him to come in∣to
Oxfordshire? No, <HI>the constant business of his employ∣ment
could never suffer him to pay visits in the country,</HI>—
And you one would imagine had an employment at
court too, for it was almost as difficult to draw you
from London (to which place you <HI>know</HI> I have bid an
eternal adieu) as it is your husband; but that I know
is his fault, for which I am really angry with him;
for let me tell him I love you, I am almost tempted to
say as well as he does.</P>
<P>Remember in this last hasty visit we had neither time
nor opportunity for half an hour's private chat. The
presence of my little family prevented my asking you
your opinion of them; and you are so full of Mr.
B—and his gout, in your letter, that you speak of
nothing else—I expect that you will make amends for
this in your next.—But to be serious, for after all 'tis
nothing but the joy I feel on being delivered from a
painful suspence on your account, which has occasioned
my spirits to flow into impertinence, I do most sin∣cerely
felicitate you on Mr. B—'s disorder's having
taken so favourable a turn. According to the common
opinion it may give you hope of a much longer con∣tinuance
of so valuable a life. That you may for many
years continue a blessing to each other is the prayer
of your affectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B—to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IF you knew all, my dear Sidney, you have less
reason to reproach Mr. B—than you have to
thank him for his indulgence to us both. You know I
told you I had taken lady Mapletoft in my way down to
you, and spent a week with her. The truth is, this
was a thought which occurred to me on the road,
merely, suggested by seeing her house at the distance
only of a mile out of my route; and as I had leave of
absence for a month, I thought of stealing two or three
days out of it, in order to dedicate them to this old
friend; but I could not refuse her pressing entreaties to
stay the week out. Now you must know that during
that whole week poor Mr. B—had been labouring
under his painful disorder, for he was attacked with it
the day after I left town, and his physicians could not
tell what to make of it; yet <HI>he,</HI> supposing I was with
you, would not send for me till the danger was ap∣parently
encreased: see therefore, ungrateful as you
are, how much you are indebted to his good nature,
so let me have no more complaints; but make up by
your correspondence, the loss I must submit to in
being deprived of seeing you; for I certainly shan't
have it in my power to repeat my visit to you till next
year.</P>
<P>You wanted to ask my opinion of your young fa∣mily,
you say.—Sidney, you, who when a girl, with
more reason to be vain than any woman living, had less
vanity than any woman living, are I am afraid now
you are come to years of discretion, (for we are nei∣ther
of us old, you know) beginning to grow proud
of your children. What should my opinion of them
be? The girls are well enough, I think, for little things
bred in the country; and your son Falkland, as you call
him, is a good tolerable fort of a youth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
I have a great mind to stop here; Mr. B—, by
whose bed-side I write, bids me do so; and to be re∣venged
on you for talking of his snarling, leave you
with this mortifying reply; but I have too much
christian charity to bear malice in my heart, there∣fore
take my real sentiments, which are, that I do
from my soul think I never saw two such perfect crea∣tures
as your two daughters. I could scarce think it
possible that a little more than two years could have
produced such an alteration; they appear'd but children
when I was last in Buckinghamshire, and I believe they
now want but very little of your own fine stature. I think
I never saw any thing equal to the exquisite delicacy of
Miss Arnold's figure; and for my name-sake, <HI>such</HI>
a complexion, and <HI>such</HI> eyes! Oh, Sidney, that
girl would do a world of mischief if she were in
London; the men would tack her name to sword,
pestilence and famine. Yet I imagine, that tho' her
beauty might <HI>surprize</HI> more, it would <HI>captivate</HI> less
than that of her sister; there is an expression in the
softer charms of the elder, that would steal into
the heart without one's perceiving it; and she has
one of those faces that a man would fall in love
with, without having first discover'd that she was a
beauty. The endowments of their minds I think
are answerable to those of their persons. How sen∣sible,
how polite, how modest is their whole deport∣ment!
As for the lesser accomplishments in which the
common run of parents fancy the whole of a girl's
education consists, which indeed are no more than a
little garniture to it, they had made so considerable a
progress in all those when I last saw them, that I sup∣pose
they are now complete. Indeed, Sidney, they
wanted not the addition of twenty thousand pounds
apiece, to enhance their worth; and I can't help think∣ing
it was a strange caprice in that whimsical old cou∣sin
Warner of your's, to leave them such a fortune in∣dependent
of you. Yet he lived long enough to judge
that their dutiful and sweet dispositions would not make
an improper use of such an advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
How happy is your present situation, my dear, if you
can forget the past, and look forward to the delightful
prospect that is before you! May your prudence, your,
virtue, your piety be revived and flourish, as well as
your beauty does, in the persons of those two lovely
girls. Yet I thought at the time I saw her, and with
a sigh have since recollected, that Miss Arnold's health
does not seem so perfect as I could wish. I observed a
sort of languor in her countenance; perhaps it was
only my fancy; or it may be the natural cast of her
visage. I had not time to mention this when I was
with you, yet I beg you will get the advice of some
able physician; if a decay—I won't finish the sen∣tence
—God preserve the dear creature to you! But
pray consult some one about her health; the slightest
attack would shatter so delicate a frame.</P>
<P>Well now I have done with your daughters, a word
or two for your son. That same Falkland is a charm∣ing
pretty young man! You say he is not so handsome
as his father was: as I never saw his father, I can't
contradict you; but in my mind he is agreeable enough
to be a very dangerous object in the same house with
two young girls. I know you don't design him for
either of them, don't you therefore think it time to
separate them? Falkland must be near eighteen; were
I to judge from his person only I should think him
more.—I was pleased with his whole carriage, his
filial respect towards you, and the tender innocent ap∣pellation
of sister to the two girls, delighted me, and
checked the fears, which would otherwise have arisen,
that he might possibly have considered them in another
light. I think him very happy in having so worthy a
conductor as Mr. Price, who seems well to have dis∣charged
his duty in the care of this youth's education.
With what pleasure the good old man regards his
hopeful pupil!—I could say a thousand things more to
you; but Mr. B—cries out, Have not you done yet?
Yes, my dear, for I am come to the bottom of my
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
paper. So adieu, my Sidney, God bless you and
your amiable family.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Extract from Mrs. ARNOLD'S answer to Mrs.
CECILIA B—
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 16th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>—With regard to Miss Arnold, 'tis only your
tender fears, my dear, that have suggested to you the
thought of her being in an ill state of health, I never
had any reason to be of that opinion; yet as I know
young people are apt to conceal flight indispositions, I
have questioned her strictly on the subject, and she
assures me that nothing ails her. Yet in consequence
of the deference I pay to your judgment, I have con∣sulted
the ablest physician in this country. I suppose
he thought it necessary to advise something, and there∣fore
delivered it as his opinion, that tho' at <HI>present.</HI>
no symptoms of a disorder appeared, yet it was not
impossible but that the young lady might be <HI>tending
towards</HI> a consumptive habit, on which account he re∣commended
by way of prevention only, that she should
drink asses milk; and accordingly she is to take it every
morning.</P>
<P>I am very glad my little Falkland has your appro∣bation.
I know you look with a scrutinous eye into
the manners and behaviour of youth. I love this boy
almost equally with my daughters; for, is he not,
my Cecilia, the son of him who was once so dear to
me, and whose memory must ever be precious to my
heart? A hundred times a day does he recall his fa∣ther's
image fresh to my remembrance; the same agree∣able
vivacity, the same insinuating address, the same
tender regard to every one with whom he is con∣nected.
His tutor perfectly adores him. My two
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
children have always considered and loved him as a
brother; and I make them call him by that affectionate
name. This idea I inculcated early amongst them;
for having taken the dear unhappy orphan into my
protection, with a design to have him educated under
my own eye, I thought that precaution would suffi∣ciently
guard the young people from ever entertaining
a thought, much less a wish, that any other tie should
ever take place; and indeed is has succeeded to my
expectations; fraternal affection there is between them,
and so I would have it; but nothing like a particular
preference. To say the truth, I believe it seldom
happens that persons brought up together from child∣hood,
conceive a passion for each other. The eyes
thro' which the hearts of most young people are
reached, are first struck by novelty; and persons edu∣cated
together almost from infancy, not having this
advantage with regard to each other, by the time they
come to an age susceptible of love, would much sooner
be caught by an object less amiable than that to which
they have been accustomed, merely because it was
new. I mean to provide very handsomely for Falk∣land,
and have always told him so; yet deserving as
he is, I would not carry my partiality so far as to be∣stow
on him either of my daughters. The unhappy cir∣cumstance
of his birth forbids such a thought, had
he even a fortune which would intitle to so conside∣rable
a match, as each of my daughters will be.
Yet after all, my Cecilia, I think with you, that
Orlando is now arrived at an age, which requires more
precaution on my part, than has hitherto been ne∣cessary.
I left it to his own election to make choice
of any liberal profession to which his inclination most
led him, for his patrimony is but a trifle.—His tutor,
who you know is piety itself, would have persuaded
him to the gown, for with his abilities, he says, he
would be an ornament to the church; but my son,
whose genius seems to incline him more to the military
life, modestly excused himself to the good old man,
and said he should prefer the army. To which poor
Mr. Price unwillingly assented; but as he could not
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
bear the thoughts of his pupil's launching out into the
world so extremely young, (for this proposal was made
before we left Buckinghamshire) he begg'd to retain
him a year or two longer under his care; and after∣wards
pleaded hard that he might enter the university,
where he said he would learn to set a proper value on
his literary acquisitions, a thing which the old gen∣tleman
himself rates very highly. This step there∣fore
having been long determined, Falkland is to en∣ter
as a gentleman commoner of Exeter College the
week after next. Thus you see, my dear, are your
wishes anticipated, as Orlando will of course remove
immediately from my house; and as you know we
are five miles from Oxford, we probably shall seldom
see him but in the vacations, and at the same time
be near enough to have an eye to his conduct. Mr.
Price is to continue with me, my chaplain in effect,
tho' my rank in life does not qualify me to confer on
him so formal a title.</P>
<P>All under my roof kiss your hands a thousand
times. Mrs. Askham, who dined with me yesterday,
presents her best respects to you; she was inconsolable
on hearing that you had been in this part of the coun∣try,
and had left it before she knew of your arrival.
She says, had she been informed of it, she would have
flown to Woodberry, if it were only to get one look,
at you.—Adieu, my love.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B—to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 18th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>REJOICED as I always am to hear from you, I
never was better pleas'd at the receipt of any
letter from you than at that of your last, which came
into my hands at a most happy juncture. You must
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
know we had a visit from Sir George Bidulph to-day;
he was coming from court, and stepp'd in just to ask
Mr. B—how he did. He seem'd surprised at see∣ing
me, as he knew not I was come to town, having
been inform'd the last time he was here, that I was
gone down to Oxfordshire, with a design of passing a
month with you</P>
<P>After the first how-do-ye's were over, and Mr.
B—had sworn two or three oaths at him, for
hurting his toe with the point of his sword, as he
brushed by his elbow-chair, Sir George addressed
himself to me with Well, Madam, how does my sister
do, for I have not had a line from her these two
months? Sidney is too methodical a correspondent
for me, for if I don't answer her letters punctually, I
am sure not to hear a word from her; and faith 'tis
impossible for a man to find time to write, when he is
so perpetually engaged as I am;—and then he strut∣ted
up to the glass, again hurt Mr. B—'s toe,
and received two or three more curses. I told him I
had left you and your family perfectly well, and that
you had been complaining to me of his silence. When
are those two girls to take the veil? said he, turning,
to me with a sarcastical smile: Or does their mother
intend to marry one of them to young Falkland, and
the other to old Price; for I don't know any other
choice they can have, in that d—n'd place where she
keeps them buried alive. I was provoked at his gibe,
not having such an answer ready as I could have
wish'd. Mr. B—laugh'd, and Sir George went
on; I declare, Mrs. B—, you ladies of the <HI>first</HI> rate
understandings, are the most unfit people upon earth
to conduct the <HI>common</HI> affairs of life. Would any wo∣man
in the world, but Mrs. Arnold, keep two young
ladies like my nieces, mew'd up in such a wretched
obscure corner, where it is impossible they can <HI>learn</HI>
any thing? You forget, I replied, how accomplish'd
your sister herself was, who was bred up in the same
manner. I don't mean, said he, the common accomp∣lishments
that are to be bought by paying a master;
the learning I would have them acquire is a little
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
knowledge of the world; which I am sure my sister
with all her wisdom, nor Price with all his philosophy,
will never be able to teach them: that is a science to
be learnt only by mixing <HI>with</HI> the world. Three
years ago, continued he, you may remember, when
lady Sarah was in Buckinghamshire, she press'd my
sister to let the two Miss Arnolds pass the winter
with her in London, and Sidney's refusal of this re∣quest,
though gloss'd over with a thousand fine ex∣cuses,
is to tell you the truth, the reason of our never
having paid her a visit since. They were too young
at that time, I replied, and (for want of something
else to say) added, for which perhaps you won't
thank me,—I dare say were lady Sarah <HI>now</HI> to make
the same proposal, Mrs. Arnold would readily em∣brace
it. I don't know that, answered Sir George;
I am afraid that Sidney is in some respects but too like
—he stopped short: but I knew what he <HI>would</HI>
have said, and that your dear good mother was then
in his thoughts. For heaven's sake, pursued he (in
his impatient way) do you know what she intends to
do with that boy? To marry him to her eldest dau∣ghter,
cried Mr. B—lengthening out the last word
from a twitch of the gout, which at that minute seiz∣ed
him. By my soul, may be so, said Sir George;
that would be tipping the spire, and winding up her
bottoms with a witness. Mr B—who only spoke
in jest, laughed and grunted at Sir George's taking
it so seriously. I will venture to say, replied I, such
a wild thought never entered into Mrs. Arnold's head.
I should suppose so too, said Sir George; your hus∣band
has only a mind to be pleasant. No, Mrs. B—,
continued he very solemnly, well as I loved that noble
fellow his father, whose fate to this hour I deplore, I
would not consent that my niece should marry the <HI>il∣legitimate</HI>
offspring of the best man in the kingdom.—
But in the present case, nothing but frenzy could sug∣gest
such a thought; a poor fellow who has no pros∣pect
in the world but from my sister's bounty! I own
I could never have a very cordial regard for that youth,
on his vile mother's account; it is an unwarrantable
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
prejudice I grant; but as my mother used to say of
hers, (which by the way she would never allow to <HI>be</HI>
prejudices) it is <HI>unconquerable.</HI></P>
<P>Just at this word my maid entered the room, and
gave me your letter: having read it over to myself,
and found there was nothing in it but what your bro∣ther
might see, I presented it to Sir George, who
having kept a profound silence during the time I took
to read it, I concluded had been waiting in expecta∣tion
of at least hearing part of it. I requested him to
read it aloud, that Mr. B—might participate with
us.</P>
<P>I saw Sir George's countenance brighten, for I
watched his looks, when he came to that part of it
where you mention your designs with regard to Or∣lando.
In returning me the letter, your brother said,
Sidney is more <HI>rational</HI> than I expected, (a high com∣pliment
you'll say) you see in <HI>this</HI> particular, laying
his finger on the paragraph, which related to young
Falkland's birth, she judges pretty much as I do; a
sufficient reason, my dear, for allowing you to think
<HI>rationally:</HI> and yet, pursued he smiling, I perceive,
from some part of my sister's letter, that <HI>you</HI> Mrs.
B—were not without your fears, ridiculous as the
idea appeared to us all just now; for my part I shall
be always ready to <HI>serve</HI> the young man, and as far as
my interest goes, will push him forward in life when
he enters into the profession of which he has made
choice; poor fellow, he is not accountable for the
iniquities of his mother. I found that Sir George, so
soon as he had lost his apprehensions, suffered his hu∣manity
to return. These men of the world learn, I
believe, to accommodate their feelings as well as their,
language to exteriour circumstances. As for my nie∣ces,
continued he, there is no doubt of their being
intitled to marry into some of the best families in the
kingdom: but unless my sister supposes that on the
bare <HI>fame</HI> of their perfections, she will have them de∣manded
of her like princesses, I don't see how this is
very likely to be effected. 'Tis a pity you don't get
them to town, said Mr. B—; I know no one so fit
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
as lady Sarah to introduce them into life. I bit my
lips at this: Ah, thought I, my Sidney <HI>has</HI> a friend,
whom I dare believe she thinks as well qualified as her
ladyship for this task; but unfortunately <HI>that friend</HI>
is not enough mistress of her own actions to make the
offer. Lady Sarah would like it extremely, said Sir
George, and if Mrs. Arnold is disposed to let them, I
shall be as ready to receive them as I was before; but
the season is now too far advanced for such a propo∣sal,
as we shall go into Somersetshire early in the sum∣mer,
so that this design can't possibly take place till
next winter; I shall however, when I write next to
my sister, again make her the offer.</P>
<P>I have given you the substance of Sir George's con∣versation,
and shall now throw in as my own opinion,
as well as that of others, that it is really time for
young ladies of your daughters fortunes and condition
in life, to see a little of the beau monde.—Their situ∣ations
in the world will probably be very conspicuous
(at least Sir George's endeavours will not be wanting
to make them so) and one would not chuse that young
creatures should emerge at once from solitude, and
appear as <HI>principals</HI> in the glare and bustle of the gay
world; for fine as are their understandings, and
charmingly elegant as is their whole behaviour, there
is a certain ease of deportment, which you know cha∣racterizes
real good breeding, and which can be at∣tained
in no other way but by being familiarized to
the modes of the great world; and your <HI>very</HI> fine
people, who do not give modesty the first place in
their catalogue of virtues, would be apt to call the
sweet timidity of Miss Arnold, country bashfulness.
Now I want, this to be a <HI>leetle</HI> overcome, before she
is set down perhaps under the necessity of keeping vi∣siting
days for half the coxcombs and flaunting wo∣men
of quality in town to assemble at her house. Sir
George really keeps the best company, and lady Sa∣rah,
poor as her intellects are, is an adept in all the
fashionable fopperies of the times, and even <HI>passes</HI> for
a sensible woman: besides, what situation can be more
eligible (your own maternal care out of the question)
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
than an uncle's house, under the guidance of his lady,
both of them people in considerable estimation?</P>
<P>I have urged this point the more, as I know you
have so mean an opinion of lady Sarah, that I am still
apprehensive of your unwillingness to venture so pre∣cious
a charge as your two daughters with her: and
I have been the speedier in writing to you, that as I
am certain your brother means to repeat his offer, I
may be beforehand as well in preparing you for it, as
in begging of you to accept it. Pray, my dear, <HI>de∣seend</HI>
a little, and think more, like one of <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>I embrace you, and the dear girls, and salute the
fine old man, and the fine young man; and pray tell
Mrs. Askham, that I regret as much as she does our
not having met.</P>

<P>CECILIA, with all my faults, I was never ac∣counted
inflexible; you needed not therefore
have united your force, with that of my brother, to
persuade me to a thing which in itself I think reason∣able,
and against which, whatever little collateral
objections I have to it in my own private thoughts, I
can offer none to Sir George, because they relate al∣together,
as you very well know to lady Sarah. Poor
woman! She was herself spoil'd when a girl by the
weak indulgence of her mother. She has never had
any children of her own, to call forth those little ma∣ternal
attentions, so necessary in conducting young
people; and she is besides (notwithstanding the
world's kind opinion) not overburdened with discre∣tion;
so that, upon the whole, I do indeed think
her but a sorry pilot to guide a young lady through
the stormy pleasures of your great town I rely how∣ever
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
ever on my my brother's care, and <HI>have</HI> consented to
let both my girls be with him next winter: now are
you satisfied?</P>
<P>I received a very obliging letter from my brother
three days ago, in which he kindly repeated his invi∣tation
to my daughters; but at the same time threw
out a hint that vexed me, viz. that having no children
of his own to provide for, his nieces fortunes might not
be <HI>impaired</HI> by making themselves agreeable to him and
lady Sarah.—This very item, Cecilia, almost tempt∣ed
me to write him a refusal; for won't it look, to
one of Sir George's cast, (you, my dear, know him as
well as I do) as if it had its weight in inducing me to
comply with a proposal which I had before declined?
Yet <HI>you</HI> must be convinced such a motive could have
no influence on me at any time, if balanced with
more material objections to the offer; how much
less then in my present affluent flow of fortune? The
truth is, I have yielded to Sir George's request merely
for my daughters sake; for I agree with you in every
argument, that you have urged in favour of this step;
and at the same time I acknowledge that I should be
very unwilling to disoblige a brother with whom I
have now lived for so many years upon the best terms.
And upon reflection, I am pleased that matters are
settled as they are; for to tell you a secret, I had re∣solved
to send my daughters to town early next winter
under the care of lady Audley, to whom, next to
yourself, I would sooner commit that important
charge than to any one I know. For she has united
in her, qualities which do not <HI>constantly</HI> meet in the
same person; that is to say, she is an excellent good
woman, besides being, in the <HI>best,</HI> not the most <HI>modish</HI>
acceptation of the word, a <HI>real</HI> fine lady. I believe I
formerly mentioned her to you as one of the first ac∣quaintances
that I made on my coming to settle in
this country. She has an elegant little house at Ox∣ford,
just without the town, where she generally pas∣ses
half the year; and were she to follow her own
inclinations, would prefer living entirely in the coun∣try;
but in complaisance to her daughter, she always
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
spends her winters in London. She is to an extrava∣gant
degree partial to my two girls; and as there is a
great intimacy between them and Miss Audley, I
thought they could not be more agreeably situated.
I am sure lady Audley will be very sorry for the dis∣appointment.
She had pressed me earnestly, and I
made her a half promise that my daughters should be
with her; but if this intention were to have taken
place, I know Sir George would never have forgiven
me, so I think 'tis better as it is. My son took his
leave of us yesterday, and repaired to Oxford to enter
on his academic course of life. You can't imagine
how aukward we all felt after his departure. My
two girls cried all the morning: and when we sat
down to dinner, the footman having through inadver∣tence
placed a chair for him, disconcerted us again,
when on his removing it, he said, I forgot that Mr.
Falkland was <HI>gone.</HI> What do you mean by <HI>gone?</HI>
said Mr. Price, with as angry a look as his complai∣sant
countenance could assume; is not he just by us
here in the neighbourhood? He look'd at me and
then at my two children. The good man himself
was affected at parting with him, and saw that we
were so too: but this little passing cloud soon blew
over, and we are all sunshine again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>May 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>POOR lady V—, how I am grieved for her! I have
just received a letter from Miss Darnley, her
youngest niece, who tells me they are all in the deep∣est
affliction. I believe I have told you that lord V—'s
undutiful behaviour had so disobliged his mother, that
she had never seen him since his father's death. He
was always her favourite son, and this disappointment
of her hopes it was, which first disgusted her with the
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
world, and occasioned her retiring from it. Lord
V—, it seems, whether from compunction, or the
overflowings of a heart naturally good, and perverted
only by evil habits, had lately by letter sollicited a
reconciliation with his mother. Lady V—received
this overture from her son with joy; and having ex∣pressed
a desire to see him, he immediately set out for
Lancashire, and about a month ago arrived at Mrs.
Darnley's house; where he was received by his tender
mother with as much pleasure (so Miss Darnly ex∣presses
herself) as his first entrance into life had given
her; but her joy was of very short duration. Lord
V—was invited to an election-dinner, where having
drank too freeely, he was seized with a fever which
in six days carried him to his grave. He died in his
mother's arms, with the strongest expressions of regret
for his past ill conduct towards her. What a blow to
so affectionate a parent! How I feel for this excellent
woman! Her tenderness had revived towards him
with redoubled ardour in this melancholy moment
of eternal separation; and he was snatched from her
at a time, when his returning duty and filial affection
had opened to her a source of happiness, which she
thought had been for ever shut up. Miss Darnley
says she is inconsolable; and adds, that neither she nor
her mother are at present in a condition to comfort her,
being themselves too deeply affected at this so unex∣pected
and melancholy an event. Miss Darnley con∣cludes
her letter with the most pressing instances for
me to go down to Burnly. “Your conversation,
Madam,” says he, “I know would have a bettar
effect on my aunt than any thing we can say to her.
Can you then refuse this consolation to poor lady
V—? If you, do favour us with your company, I
believe I need not tell you how happy it will make
<HI>me,</HI> if you bring with you the two Miss Arnolds.
Remember you have long owed us a visit.”</P>
<P>Miss Darnley tells me in a postscript, that the
younger brother, now lord V—, is at present with his
regiment in Flanders; but that they expect him home
at the end of the campaign.—I think, my Cecilia,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
this event must unroot me. I had as good as resolved
never to have stirred from hence, and began to consi∣der
myself like one of the trees in my grove, which
are doomed to drop unnoticed in the solitude where
they grew. I am really become so in love with my
retirement, that it is a pain to me to think of quitting
it, for ever so short a space; yet I am afraid this is
being too selfish; I will not therefore indulge the habit
which I find every day growing stronger upon me.
How I should hate myself, how you would despise
your Sidney, if she should prefer her own satisfaction
to that of the friend she loved!</P>
<P>I have written a letter of condolance to poor lady
V—, and have told her I mean immediately to follow
it myself, and intend to bring my two daughters with
me to kiss her hands; adding, that I shall pass the
summer at Burnly, if Mrs. Darnley will suffer me and
my little houshold to incommode her so long.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD, to Mrs. CECILIA B—
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>June 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OUR little plan of operations has been partly dis∣concerted
by an accident, which however I hope
will be attended with no other disagreeable consequences
than that of obliging me to leave one of my girls at
home.</P>
<P>A cold which Dolly had got by walking too late by
the river side, occasioned my deferring my journey into
Lancashire for some days; but as she is now better,
we were all in readiness and intended to have set off
to-morrow morning, when to-day, just as we fat down
to dinner, I perceived a chariot, the horses upon full
gallop, driving up the avenue. It stopped at the
door, and Miss Audley sprung out of it, with a pre∣cipitation
that alarmed me, as I thought that something
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
extraordinary was the cause; and so indeed there was;
for what can occasion greater consternation to a fine
girl than the fear of losing her beauty? The case in
short was this; Master Audley, a boy. of about nine
years old, and the darling of the family, was taken ill
of the small-pox. Miss, who is about eighteen, has
never had it, and the doctor no sooner announced the
distemper, than poor lady Audley, in the utmost terror,
ordered the chariot and hurried her daughter out of
the house, who you may imagine was not less frigh∣tened
than herself. Miss Audley told me her mama's
extreme apprehensions had obliged her to intrude upon
my good nature, in begging that I would suffer Miss
to stay with me till the danger was over. I told the
young lady I was extremely obliged to lady Audley for
honouring me with such a preference; and that I
should have thought myself but too happy in her
company, if an indispensible engagement had not for
the present rendered it impossible for me to enjoy it.
I then told her of the absolute promise I was under of
going into Lancashire; but without mentioning my
design of taking my daughters with me; said if she
would dispense with <HI>my</HI> absence, the two Miss Arnolds
and Mr. Price (whom I looked upon as the father of
the family) would endeavour to make her stay as
agreeable as possible. I know, Madam, said she, you
never go any where without the Miss Arnolds; I am
certain you meant to take them with you, and 'tis
your politeness only which prevents you from saying
so. I see I am come unseasonably; Lord, what shall I
do! My dear, answered I, 'tis paying you but a very
slight compliment to leave my daughters with you,
and I assure you if it were not for breaking thro' the
laws of faith and friendship, as well as good manners,
I would not stir from home myself. As I had not in
this reply denied my intention of taking my girls with
me, Miss Audley answered, I would not for the
world be the means of hindering the young ladies from
going with you, I am sure lady V—and Miss Darnley
would hate me. Dear Mrs. Arnold, continued she,
you can't imagine how I am distressed; for besides the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
opinion my mama has of you and the Miss Arnolds,
she really has not an acquaintance with whom she
would take the same liberty, whose house she thinks
at a sufficient distance from the infection, for there is
nothing in nature I so much dread. I know she would
be very unhappy to be obliged to send me to London,
neither should I be easy to be so far out of the reach
of hearing from my poor little brother; yet that must
be my choice, for positively I won't consent to have
the Miss Arnolds left at home. Well, my dear Miss
Audley, said I, to make you easy at once, I'll com∣pound
the matter with you; I will take one of my
daughters with me, and leave the other to keep house
with you. That settles the matter at once, cried out
both my girls in a breath. Miss Audley made a few
civil objections to this proposal; but they were easily
got over, and in the end I agreed to leave Dolly to
bear her company; tho' by the way I thought Cecilia
would have been as well pleased to have staid as she;
but I made choice of her sister for two reasons; Dolly
has a flexibility and tenderness in her nature, bordering
almost, as you have observed, even upon melancholy,
and I thought the house of mourning to which we are
going, would but serve to soften her feeling heart too
much. Cecilia, you know, is all vivacity, and not
so susceptible of impressions. My other reason was,
that it appeared rather more respectful to lady Aud∣ley,
to leave my eldest daughter by way of my repre∣tative.</P>
<P>Thus then have we settled these important ceremo∣nials,
which had like to have turned us all topsy
turvy, and I hold my resolution of setting out to-mor∣row;
but I believe this little incident will make me
shorten the intended length of my visit to lady V—.
I received a letter in the afternoon from lady Audley,
who now being more composed, repeated, in very
polite terms, the request her daughter had before made
by word of mouth. I writ her ladyship word how
we had accommodated matters, and the young people
seem mightily pleased at the thoughts of their being
together. Miss Audley is very amiable; yet for her
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
years, I have sometimes thought her a little too
<HI>womanly;</HI> I do not mean by this, that she has the least
degree of forwardness; but she has none of that <HI>timi∣dity,</HI>
of which you seemed to wish, Dolly had less.
Miss Audley has overcome it probably by the very
means you recommended, a constant intercourse with
the gay world; yet I believe her a very good young
creature, I am sure she has an excellent example in her
mother. The eldest son, Sir Edward, is of the same
college with my Orlando, who speaks very hand∣somely
of him; but by the bye I hear he is a little
extravagant, having (as he has been of age some time)
already dipt his estate, which is not very considerable,
yet lady Audley's oeconomy enables her to live with
great elegance on, as I am told, a very moderate
jointure.</P>
<P>Dolly desires me to conjure you to write to <HI>her</HI> in
my absence; we have no correspondents at present in
London but yourself, and she says she shall long to
know how you and Mr. B—do. Adieu, my Cecilia;
when you write next, direct to me at Burnly.</P>

<P>YOU can't imagine, my Cecilia, how I am divided,
at present, in my thoughts: my heart is as it
were cleft in twain, and while one half of it is re∣tained
in Oxfordshire, the other remains chained here,
by the tender ties of compassion as well as friendship
for poor lady V—. She still continues in the same me∣lancholy
state; that stupor, which I told you had suc∣ceeded
to the first outrages of her grief, is much more
alarming to her friends than her former condition. She
sits for hours without speaking, and no one in the house
but myself can rouze her from her lethargy. She takes
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
delight in hearing me talk over my own melancholy
story, and it is by this means only we can engage her
to enter into conversation; and indeed it is by this
means that I am not without hope of bringing her by
degrees to a better frame of mind; for she constantly
compares <HI>my</HI> calamities with her <HI>own,</HI> then condemns
her own impatience under an evil which she allows
inferior to <HI>many</HI> I have suffered, praises my fortitude,
and promises to imitate it, yet again relapses into her
grief. Thus circumstanced, you see 'tis impossible for
me to desert her; yet when I think of poor Dolly's situ∣ation,
I am almost tempted (selfish as I am) to leave my
friend a prey to her sorrow, and fly to my child. The
dear creature! she has gone through a scene of uneasi∣ness
and anxiety, which her tenderness for me made her
conceal till the danger was over. I had a letter from
her by the last post, wherein she tells me ……</P>
<P>[Here Mrs. Arnold gives the substance of what her
daughter writes; but as the young lady's own letter
appears, her mother's account of it is omitted. Mrs.
Arnold then proceeds]</P>
<P>To be sincere with you, I had no sooner read this,
than forgetting the duties of charity, as well as my at∣tachments
of gratitude to lady V. I as good as resolved
to return home directly. I even went so far as to ap∣prize
Mrs. Darnley of my design, putting my daugh∣ter's
letter at the same time into her hand. The tears
came into the poor lady's eyes the minute I talked of
going; for she doats on her sister. What will become
of us, cried she, when you are gone? The agitation
she observed in my countenance made her conclude
that something indispensible called me away. Having
read my daughter's letter, Compose yourself, my dear
madam, said she, read this over again, and then I
hope you will not think there is so <HI>absolute</HI> a necessity
for your presence at Woodberry. My fears, indeed,
upon a second perusal, were much abated, and I found
that my imagination only had painted to me as <HI>present,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
a danger which in reality had been over for some time.
What becomes of our reason, my Cecilia, in those
moments of surprize? to what corner does the slug∣gard
retire, to wait for the calmer hours of reflection,
when the busy passions are all up and alarmed?</P>
<P>I am sure Dolly would not deceive me: I therefore
flatter myself that matters are as well at home as she
has represented them, yet I cannot be quite easy at this
distance from my family. Poor Cecilia wishes to be
with her sister: indeed I almost repent my having
brought her with me; yet how could I refuse Miss
Darnley's request, especially after she had my promise
that both my daughters should attend her? In short, I
am in such an unsettled state of mind, as really gives
some little merit to my stay at Burnly. Yet I am
ashamed to balance what I consider merely as the par∣tial
tenderness of a parent, with the more important
offices of Christianity, which, in poor lady V 's case,
<HI>demand</HI> my attendance here; and I could never for∣give
myself, if I neglected the means which her friends,
and indeed I myself, think are in my power to restore,
in some measure, her mind to tranquillity. Thus con∣strained
by duty, I believe I must continue here, ac∣cording
to my first promise, till the latter end of Au∣gust;
so that you must expect nothing from hence but
the anecdotes of this gloomy mansion.</P>

<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 8th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DON'T be angry with me, my dear mama, for
having concealed from you an accident which
terrified us all here to death; but our apprehensions
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
are now over, thank God, thank God! Do not be
frightened, madam, for indeed the danger is intirely
past; but we had like to have lost, Oh! mama, we
had like to have lost poor Orlando!</P>
<P>About a week ago he came to see us one evening,
and Sir Edward Audley came with him, to pay a visit
to his sister. I never loved that Sir Edward Audley,
and shall love him now less than ever. Mr. Falkland
and he were in the garden together, and Sir Edward
(unlucky creature!) proposed leaping from the haha at
the end of the terrace into the meadow. Miss Audley
and I were looking at them from my dressing room
window. Sir Edward took his leap first, and came on
his feet at the other side. Orlando followed him; we
saw him fall, and that even with the assistance of his
companion he seemed not able to rise. Miss Audley says
I shriek'd out. I can't tell whether I did or not; but
I know I found myself at the end of the terrace with∣out
knowing how I got thither. Poor Orlando was
standing up by that time, and seemed to be in violent
pain. Sir Edward told us that the ground being slip∣pery
(for we have had a good deal of rain lately) had
occasioned him to miss his step, and having leaped just
on the edge of the steep, he had tumbled down and
dislocated his shoulder.</P>
<P>He walked in, though with difficulty. Mr. Price
(good, good man, how I love him for his fatherly ten∣derness)
was in the utmost concern. He sent immedi∣ately
to Oxford for Mr. Oswald, who not being very
readily to be found, poor Orlando suffered four hours
of the most exquisite torture. I think I am no very
great coward, mama, when any thing ails me; but I
don't know how it is, the seeing another in violent pain
has something in it that extremely affects my spirits:
for when Mr Oswald (who did not arrive till near ten
o'clock at night) was setting Mr. Falkland's shoulder,
I fainted away twice, though I was in a distant part of
the house, merely at the thought of what he endured.
When the operation was over, Mr. Price had him put
into bed, and sat up with him the whole night; but
we had all, thoughtless as we were, neglected one
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
material thing, which was what had like to have been
fatal to Mr. Falkland; for with regard to the accident
of his shoulder, Mr. Oswald said there was nothing
dangerous in it; but it seems the bottom of that vile
ditch into which he had fallen was full of water, and
he had been wet quite through, without either he him∣self
or any of us perceiving it: so that having fat so
long in that condition, he had got a violent cold,
which threw him the next day into a high fever.
I would have written to my dear mama an account of
this immediately; but I am glad I was directed by a
wiser head than my own. Mr. Price advised me not;
he thought it would be giving you unnecessary pain, as
probably his pupil's disorder might go off in a few
days: this, therefore, it was which prevented my
mentioning our situation to you in my last letter; but
indeed, madam, you know not what I have suffered
since. They would all have persuaded me that
Orlando never was in any <HI>very</HI> great danger; but I
am sure <HI>I</HI> thought he was, and for five days and
nights have never left his bed-side, in spite of all that
Mr. Price or Miss Audley could say to me She in∣deed
is kind enough to sit up with me; Mrs. Nelson
does the same; but the unfeeling fat old woman al∣ways
falls asleep in the easy chair. Pray, mama,
would not you have watched your poor Orlando with
as much care as I have done? I am sure you would.
But he is now, with joy I can assure you, he is now
much better. He presents his duty and most respect∣ful
love to you, and begs to be tenderly remember∣ed
to my sister. Be so good, madam, to make my
compliments to lady V. Mrs. and Miss Darnley, and
tell my Cecilia I long to embrace her. Mr. Price
bids me assure you, that he never forgets you in his
devotions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>OH 'tis in vain, 'tis all in vain!</HI>—I hope, my dear
Edward, you will not go on with the old song,
and say, <HI>Death and despair must end the fatal, fatal,</HI>
&amp;c. But in plain prose, all that I have been saying
and doing for you is to no purpose, and our design is
dropt plumb to the ground!—Heavens! cry you, is it
possible? can the lovely, the tender, the flexible Do∣rothea
(for <HI>Dolly</HI> won't do when we talk in hero∣ics)
can she in that soft bosom hide a flinty heart?
No such thing, child, her heart is as tender as you
could wish it; nay more, this fair insensible, this ala∣baster
statue, as you used to call her, glows at this
minute with the most ardent passion! but not for you,
Edward; no, brother, you are not the happy man,
Who the deuce is then? cry you again. Simpleton,
can't you guess? But I don't wonder that <HI>you</HI> should
not when the poor thing herself did not know a
word of the matter till <HI>I</HI> found it out for her. I'll
tell you how it was. You remember the evening that
Falkland met with the accident, Miss Arnold and I
were looking at you from one of the windows. Her
frantic scream at seeing him fall, and her flying like
a wood-nymph to the place where he lay, gave me
the first suspicion of the real state of her heart, and
determined me to observe her closely. On finding
him so violently hurt, I perceived an energy in her
grief to which neither friendship nor sraternal love
could have given rise; for well as I love you, Edward,
I do really believe I should not have been so much af∣fected,
had the mischance befallen you, as she was at
its having happened to Falkland; and yet the poor in∣nocent
deceived herself with a belief that it was only
because <HI>our brother</HI> Orlando, as their mother has
taught them to call him, had met with such a disaster
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
During the time of his illness, she was so possessed
with a firm persuasion of his danger (a natural fear
where a life <HI>particularly</HI> dear to us is in the question)
that she <HI>would</HI> watch by him herself. <HI>I</HI> in civility
to her could not avoid doing the same. As for honest
Price, who saw there was nothing really dangerous in
the case, he used after he had smoaked his pipe and
<HI>set the watch,</HI> as he called it (finding he could not per∣suade
Miss Arnold out of her apprehensions) to retire
quietly to bed. The housekeeper, for form sake,
always made one of our nocturnal party; but the
good woman constantly snored away the night in per∣fect
tranquillity. It was in those hours I saw the ge∣nuine
source of Dolly's attention laid open. With
what tender folicitude did she watch every breath that
he respired! If he sighed, she started, and with a
voice softer than the breezes of the youngest Zephyr,
would she enquire how he did. She would herself
give him such little medicines as were prescribed;
and I could observe her hand tremble, when in pre∣senting
them to him, it happened to touch his. Oh,
Edward, these symptoms were too strong not to indi∣cate
the disease to one <HI>more</HI> ignorant than I am. I
knew Dolly was as ingenuous as truth itself; yet love
teaches the best of us art, and I was resolved to try
what proficiency she had made in its school. I pre∣tended,
the night before last, to be very drowzy,
and begged she would dispense with my fitting up
with her. Bless me, said she, sure you would not
leave me to attend Mr. Falkland alone! you know
Nelson cannot keep awake a minute—And of what
use would she be to you, I replied, were she ever so
watchful, since you take the care of your patient in∣tirely
on yourself? But the <HI>impropriety</HI> of it! said
Miss Arnold.—<HI>Impropriety,</HI> my dear! what impro∣priety
is there in attending a sick <HI>brother?</HI> I said the
last word with an emphasis, fixing my eyes on her at
the same time, and I believe I looked a little arch∣ly.
—A faint blush overspread her face, and with a
sigh she answered, Oh, Sophy, you know that is but
a <HI>name,</HI> and that Mr. Falkland is in reality no relation
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
to me. Ah, Dolly, cried I, have I at last caught
you? I am no longer now to seek the cause of your
being so deaf to all my pleadings for poor Sir Ed∣ward!
She looked terrified—What do you mean,
Miss Audley? Nothing, my dear, but that you love
Falkland better. Certainly, <HI>maam</HI>—But <HI>much</HI> better,
Miss Arnold, better than you do any body—We have
been brought up together, said she (her voice falter∣ing
as if in an ague fit) I have been taught…to
love him from my infancy. Ask your heart this plain
question, said I, and report to me honestly the an∣swer
it makes you; Is there any one in the world so
dear to it as Orlando Falkland? She paused a little,
then bursting into tears, she threw herself on my neck,
and only sobbed out, Oh, Miss Audley, this is cruel!
I let her passion have vent, then embracing her in my
turn, You have no reason to be ashamed, my dear,
said I; for spight of my partiality to my brother (whose
hopes I see are now at an end) I must acknowledge
that I know no one more amiable or more deserving
of your heart than Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>My <HI>heart!</HI> said she, and again renewed her tears;
Oh fye, fye upon such a heart, that never gave me
warning of my danger till it was past remedy! But I
have one comfort left, added she, Orlando has not
the least suspicion that I—The formidable word
<HI>love</HI> stuck in her throat, and she stopped short; but I
eek'd out the sentence for her. and replied coolly,
<HI>that you love him;</HI> he must be blind then, for I have
seen it a long time—What a weak wretch I am! cried
she. For what, my dear miss Arnold? Is there any
thing blameable in your loving a handsome accom∣plished
young man, whom every one admires? But
circumstanced as I am, said she, and without the least
advance on his side, who, I am sure, only considers
me as a friend—There, my dear, I am sure you are
in an error; for if I am not mistaken, Falkland loves
you as well as you do him. I saw a beam of pleasure
lighten in her languid eyes; for however repugnant
to prudence, to interest, nay to duty and reason it∣self,
our passion may be, though we endeavour to
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
hide it, and even wish and struggle perhaps to rid
ourselves of it, though the accomplishment of our
wishes may be at ever so great a distance; nay though
they appear even impracticable, yet there is a be∣witching
pleasure in the thought of being beloved
again that we cannot resist. This is vanity, brother;
but it is the way of us women; and of you men too,
I suppose, if you would but be honest enough to own
it; but your pride helps you out on those occasions,
and if you are not kindly received, you assume a no∣ble
air of indifference, are sorry you lost so much
time, and will give yourself no farther trouble, when
all the while you would part with one of your eyes
to make the poor woman as uneasy as yourself.</P>
<P>Well, but now you will ask me how comes it that
I not only deserted <HI>your</HI> cause, but even became an
advocate for Falkland? The question is pertinent,
Sir, and deserves a serious answer. Thus it is then.</P>
<P>To be plain with you, though I could not resist
your intreaties, I had very little hopes of this affair
from the beginning. When I first mentioned your
love to Miss Arnold, and endeavoured to sound <HI>her</HI> in∣clinations,
she expressed herself so <HI>very</HI> civilly of you,
that I at once gave the thing up for lost. Had she
affected not to understand me, and given herself a
few pretty airs (which by the bye the poor dear girl
does not know how to do) nay, had she pretended to
have been angry with <HI>me,</HI> and found twenty faults
with <HI>you;</HI> I should have had some hopes of her. But
no such thing; she resented not my urging your suit,
nor threw out a single expression of disapprobation
towards you; but on the contrary, having paid your
personal merit some compliments, she added, Yet I
wish, for his own as well as <HI>your</HI> sake, that he had
honoured some one else with his affections; for besides
(forgive me, my dear) some objections which I know
my mama would have to him, I really do not find in
myself the least inclination towards him.</P>
<P>This was too mortifying a reply, Sir Edward, to
be repeated to a lover; and you know, therefore,
that without absolutely extinguishing your hopes I
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
never flattered them. The truth is, I did not then
suspect that you had a rival, and did not know what
time, perseverance, and opportunity might do; ac∣cordingly,
having lost the hopes of the girls being in
town with us next winter, I made myself an inmate
at Woodberry, in order to improve, if possible, eve∣ry
minute to your advantage; but I am now con∣vinced
my endeavours will be fruitless with regard to
miss Arnold, and I do most seriously recommend it to
you to think no more of her. Now do I see you
bite your lips, <HI>Think no more of her!</HI> that's mighty
easily, said, truly! And so all my expectations, and
your pretended efforts to serve your brother, must
end in, <HI>Think no more of her!</HI> How ridiculous this is
of you, Sophy, when I have told you that I am in,
love with miss Arnold!—Very true; but have not
you at the same time a small tendresse for her for∣tune,
my dear brother? Psha, what then? Ought
not you, for that very reason, not so slightly to have
given up my interests, and preferred those of my ri∣val?
And now pray what are those reasons which you
were to give me for acting so unkind a part? Softly,
don't be in a passion, and I'll tell you; for this is the
very place where they will come in pat. Miss Ar∣nold,
I again repeat it to you once for all, is as much
out of your reach as if she were in the moon. I am
sorry for it, because I believe you love her; at the
same time I cannot think a flame so newly kindled
can have gathered strength enough to render it inex∣tinguishable.
Don't you think it possible, my dear
Edward, to transfer it to her sister? Cecilia has <HI>twen∣ty
thousand pounds</HI> as well as Dolly; she is very pretty,
very, lively, and it is to be presumed intirely disen∣gaged;
and as you never made any <HI>personal</HI> addresses
to miss Arnold, what I have said to her can easily be
turned off. I have known a courtship begun in plea∣santry,
and apparently to pique another woman, end
in very serious consequences. I can tell you it was
Cecilia that my mama had in her thoughts for you
when she pressed Mrs. Arnold to let both the ladies
pass the winter with her in London; for indeed we
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
were both of opinion that Dolly was too reserved,
and too much bigotted to her duty, to venture on dis∣posing
of herself without her mother's consent, and
that's a thing not to be look'd for; for besides Mrs.
Arnold's thinking you a little <HI>naughty,</HI> as Dolly hinted
to me, there are such things as jointures and settle∣ments
and such impertinent incumbrances, always
tack'd to the tail of a parent's consent; and you are
sensible it would be rather inconvenient to you at
present to have your rent roll scrutinized by fellows
in great wigs. My advice, therefore, is, that you
leave Falkland in quiet possession of his conquest,
and turn your arms towards a less impregnable for∣tress.
Having given you the end of my clue, now
can't you go on unwinding it, till you have develop∣ed
the reasons of my conduct, which lie snug, like a
silkworm in the midst of its web? You can't, you
say! You are very dull, Edward; you a logician!
Don't you see that if, miss Arnold be. encouraged in
her inclination for Falkland, she may by degrees be
brought to receive his private addresses? Terrified
as she now is at, the bare thought of such a trans∣gression,
the approaches to it will be so sweet, so
flattering, to her wishes, that she may be led imper∣ceptibly
to the very point; the mere, mention of
which would, at this minute, make her start. And
don't you see that this, will open the way for you to
her sister? If Dolly should after all be so old-fashion'd
as to yield the interests of her heart to her obedience,
as her mother did before her, why there's an end
of my whole plan; but if on the contrary, the girl;
strongly prepossessed as she is in favour of Falkland,
and aided, with a. little of my good advice and as∣sistance,
will pluck up spirit enough to choose for
herself, I think our, or rather <HI>my</HI> design, may be
accomplished. There is nothing like the force of ex∣ample,
Edward; and Cecilia has been so used to look
up to her sister as a pattern, that it would be strange
if she would not follow her lead in this, as well as
in other things. Short as my acquaintance with the
world has been, many a match have I known brought
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
about by this very means. You can't imagine how
aukward a girl feels if her sister has a lover, and she
none. I take it for granted that Falkland need only
be informed of them, to avail himself of the kind
sentiments miss Arnold has for him. Be it your care
to acquaint him with that secret, as one you picked
out of me. You know nothing is more natural; and
this of course must engage him to forward your inte∣rests
with Cecilia. They say grief is lightened by
partnership: I fancy people think that blame is so
too; for we are generally mighty glad to have others
participate with us in the same fault, and I don't
suppose that a young man of Falkland's age and spi∣rit
will be over scrupulous on this point; neither do
I see any reason why young ladies, whose fortunes
render them independent, should not please them∣selves
in the choice of husbands.</P>
<P>I have written this letter by fits and starts, as I
could steal time and opportunity. Poor Dolly is so
frightened at the discovery she has made of the situ∣ation
of her own heart, that she appears to me as if
she wanted to fly from herself, and, contrary to those
romantick lovers who choose in solitude to indulge
their tender ideas, she seeks my company more than
ever. Not to talk of Falkland though, don't mistake
the matter; she is now afraid even to name him,
and always tries to avoid the subject; but I, who
think it would be a pity so bright a flame should
die for want of a little <HI>fanning,</HI> contrive always to
introduce him into our conversation by the name of
<HI>some</HI> body, and under this appellation she suffers me
to say twenty wild things that, would startle her were
I to join the dreaded name of <HI>Falkland</HI> to them. Long
as this letter is, I have a hundred other things to say
to you; but I'll send it off as it is, and when you
have considered the matter a little, let me know your
mind.</P>
<P>Your's, in a violent hurry; for here's miss Arnold
coming up stairs.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 13th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have taken three days to consider your long let∣ter;
and the season is, because I only <HI>think</HI> as
you <HI>write,</HI> by fits and starts. I laughed heartily at
that part of it where you so seriously recommend Ce∣cilia
to me, It put me in mind (pardon the compa∣rison)
of my man David, who having lost a very fine
pointer, of which I was extremely fond, told me,
he'd <HI>see and get me another every jot as pre'ty.</HI> Blockhead,
said I, what's that to the purpose? Lord, Sir,
said he, is not one dog as good as another?—You
seem to be pretty much of David's opinion, Sophy,
and to think that one <HI>woman</HI> is as good as another;
and faith, upon the whole, you are not much mista∣ken:
for to me the only essential difference is for∣tune;
and I would not abate a girl a thousand pound
for all the charms of Helen, and the chastity of Lu∣crece
into the bargain.</P>
<Q><L>That I did love the gentle Dorothea, is most true:</L>
<L>True, I would have married her—</L></Q>
<P>But since she has slipped through our fingers, I'll
e'en be content with Cecilia, who, as David said of
the dog, is every jot as pretty. Seriously, I do ex∣ceedingly
admire miss Arnold; and when I appointed
you my soft embassadress, I commissioned you to
speak the real sentiments of my heart; for I <HI>was</HI>
within a hair's breadth of being actually in love with
her, and <HI>had</HI> she been kind!—But 'tis no matter,
I'll not hang myself this bout; my heart, (how I
hug the dear rogue for it) is as obedient to me as my
hand, and I have forbid it ever to breathe another,
sigh for her.—<HI>She does not find in herself the least in∣clination
towards me.</HI> Was not that her provoking
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
cold reply? Oh the little sorceress! I wish I had hold
of her. I'll write those freezing words on scrolls of
paper, and wear them as the Jews did their philacte∣ries,
as amulets against her insolent charms.—<HI>Let
her go, I'll think no more of her</HI>—and yet she is a
charming creature! and so is Cecilia: those two sis∣ters
have often reminded me of Cowley's description of
the two daughters of Saul. How is it? for you are
better acquainted with old Dan Cowley than I am—
<Q><L>The stately Merab, seems some regal tower,</L>
<L>Michal, some virgin queen's delicious bower.—</L></Q>
Ay, that same little Michal shall be my choice. I
thank you for putting me in mind of her: there is
something in the very name of Cecilia that conveys
to me an idea of the blush and fragrance of opening
roses, the pure unsullied whiteness of the lilly, and
all the glowing beauties of the spring; for is she
not herself the goddess of it? Youth and health
dance in her sprightly eyes, and <HI>her</HI> Cupids, instead
of being spiteful urchins that delight in mischief,
are good-humoured little laughing cherubs, whose
harmless shafts tickle rather than wound. But after
all, suppose (for it is good to suppose every thing
within the laws of possibility) that this girl should,
like her sister, take it into her head not to like me,
what is to be done then? for positively my affairs
are in a con founded bad way. For between the
roguery of my father's agent, who pretends (though
I am sure I had not half the money) that he let me
have near two thousand pounds, even before my fa∣ther's
death, and for which the old dog has since got a
mortgage; between his knavery, I say, and my own
little vagaries since, I owe above six thousand
pounds, not to mention a charge on the estate of
three thousand more for Harry; a heavy tax, So∣phy,
on poor twelve hundred a year, out of which
too, you know, I pay my mother her jointure;
think of this, my girl, and tremble for your poor
brother's situation!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
But now, after having supposed the worst, (after
which nothing but a gulph opens before, where <HI>con∣jectural</HI>
will be swallowed up in <HI>certain</HI> destruction)
let us suppose the best, and that Cecilia should not
find in herself any <HI>dis</HI>-inclination towards me, how
are we to conduct this affair to a happy issue? For
my part, I own, even spite of your's and my mother's
management, that I foresee many difficulties in the
way. For let us grant that both the ladies like, or,
if you will, <HI>love</HI> their men, is there not a wide dif∣ference
with girls brought up as they have been,
between <HI>loving</HI> without consent, and <HI>marrying</HI> with∣out
consent? If I meant nothing but a little amour,
I should have better hopes of it; for, with reverence
to chastity be it spoken, a lady may fall into such a
scrape contrary to her intentions; and many a poor
innocent has slipped unawares into the trap, where
she has been content to stay, rather than like the
silly mouse tear herself in endeavouring to get out:
but this, you know, is out of the question, and I
have at least the merit of being an <HI>honourable</HI> lover.</P>
<P>Yet after all, you women understand one another
best, and know, I suppose, that if love and duty
fall to wrestling in a female heart, which of the
two is likeliest to have his heels tripped up. I do
therefore commit this weighty affair to your wise di∣rection,
and own I think your conclusions are fairly
drawn: for since Miss Arnold <HI>does</HI> love Falkland,
though I could curse her for doing so, the most pro∣bable,
means to promote our (for now you may call
them <HI>our</HI>) designs, is to encourage her in it; there∣fore
be sure, Sophy, you use your <HI>fan</HI> judiciously.
For my part, if I can discover in Falkland's heart
but a spark no bigger than the point of a needle, I'll
apply an organ-bellows to it, till I have kindled such
a flame, as shall light us both to happiness, or con∣sume
him in the conflagration. Yet I have no enmity
to <HI>him,</HI> but on the contrary like him, and think him
a very pretty fellow: but I assure you he would have
been utterly spoiled, if he had remained another year
under the tuition of that old drone Price; for you
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
cannot imagine what chimerical notions he had put
into the poor lad's head about the Lord knows what!
but I hope to cure him of them by degrees, for there
is a good <HI>soil</HI> there, though he has got some strange
prejudices, by living so many years in such a <HI>praying</HI>
family. We need not, however, I hope, be much
afraid of his <HI>scruples,</HI> though, he was wonderfully
troubled with them when he first came to college,
and used to blush like a young miss; but he has al∣ready
got over that, for I have initiated him into
a few mysteries, and purpose, at his return, to in∣troduce
him into our club, of which you have heard
me make honourable mention: it will help to file off
a little of that pedantic superstitious rust with which
the old dryad of Woodberry-grove had incrusted his
intellects: but I shall not be able to give him the last
polish till I get him to London, which I purpose
doing next vacation. Mean while, if we can bring
about an eclaircissement between him and his love, I
think our affair will be in a prosperous way, and I
shall have nothing to do but commence my attack,
when my little delicious bower returns from Burnly.</P>
<P>I never writ so long a letter in my life—Whuph!
it is past two o'clock in the morning. Go to bed,
Audley—Is it not a shame for a sober young fel∣low

<P>AND so you will really condescend to take up

glad you <HI>were</HI> a hypocrite, and am not so angry with
you for imposing on me, as I am with myself for
being imposed on. You frighten me with the ac∣count
you give of the situation of your affairs; bad
enough I knew they were, but did not think them
<HI>quite</HI> so bad as you represent them. You are a sad

<P>Miss Arnold received a letter from her mama yes∣terday.
She ran to me with it open in her hand, her
expressive features all lit up with joy. Your mama
and your sister are coming home, I suppose, said I.
She changed her countenance in an instant, and
shaking her head, I wish they were, she replied, but
they don't think of returning this month or six weeks.
I thought by your joyful countenance, my dear, that
we should have had them here in two or three days.
No, she answered, folding the letter up to put it into
her pocket, her cheeks glowing with blushes, I am
only rejoiced to hear from them, and to find that—
That what? Shew me the letter, Dolly; you brought
it to me with that design, I am sure, what has
altered your intentions? You are a strange girl,
Miss Audley; I did bring it on purpose to shew you,
and if I looked pleased, it was only because my
mama commended me. Commended you, for what,
my dear? How can you be so teazing, Sophy?
There—take the letter—She tossed it to me, and
ran out of the room.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold says in it, “I rejoice with you, my
love, on the recovery of our Orlando, and thank
you for your tender care of a life so precious to
us all. Indeed I knew not how <HI>very</HI> dear he was
to me, till convinced by my fears (with which my
first hasty perusal of your letter had alarmed me)
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
for his preservation. It was very prudent as well
as very kind in Mr. Price to conceal the danger
from me till it was past; I should certainly have
flown to you on the instant I heard the news.
Pray, do not suffer your brother to return to col∣lege
till his strength is perfectly restored. Dolly, I
wish for life only to see my children happy. Falk∣land
is one of my children; there may be ties
close as if knit by the hand of nature, and I have
the same parental affection for this boy as if he
were really my son. Had I been blessed with one,
I should have wished him just such a youth as Or∣lando.”
She then proceeds to comfort her daughter
in her present situation, under the mortification of be∣ing
absent from her mama and sister, added to the
anxiety and trouble of attending a sick room.—Com∣plains
of the necessity she is under of remaining, ac∣cording
to her promise, five or six weeks longer with
lady V—, on whose deep melancholy she expatiates,
and which, she says, nothing but <HI>her</HI> conversati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
seems to alleviate. She tells Dolly she would send
for her to Burnly, but that she thinks after the fa∣tigue
of mind and body which she has already under∣gone,
that the dejection which reigns in lady V—'s
house would contribute to depress, rather than relieve
her tender spirits; and adds, that if it were not for
Cecilia's constant chearfulness and humour, <HI>she her∣self</HI>
could hardly support it. She concludes with tel∣ling
her, that if lady Audley will be so good as to
let Miss continue at Woodberry till her (Mrs.
Arnold's) return, she shall take it as a particular fa∣vour,
as she is sure my company will be a great
consolation to her poor daughter.</P>
<P>I fancy, Edward, it will not be a very difficult
matter to prevail on lady Audley to grant her this
favour. Do you know that my mama had intended
to have made the offer herself, she tells me so in a
note I received from her this day; but I am glad she
is anticipated. The proposal shall now come from
Miss Arnold, and my stay shall be considered as a
compliment. Is it not strange that Mrs. Arnold, so
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
prudent, so cautious, and so penetrating as she seems
to be, should so widely have mistaken the character
and designs of a certain friend of ours? Poor woman
how blind these <HI>very</HI> good folks are! She has even
now, without knowing it, struck the arrow (into a
heart already pierced) at least an inch deeper than it
was before! With what fondness does she express
herself, with what warmth does she praise the already
too much beloved Falkland! This was the part of
her letter with which Dolly was so much delighted;
and yet the little simpleton would fain have persuaded
<HI>herself,</HI> as well as me, that she was pleased only be∣cause
her mother commended her. She entered the
room soon after I had done reading the letter, the
prettiest anxiety in the world in her face, and taking
me by the hand, You'll stay with me, my dear Sophy,
till my mama comes home? Sure lady Audley will
be so kind as to indulge me with your company! No
doubt, my dear, if you make the request in Mrs.
Arnold's name I will write to her ladyship immedi∣ately,
replied she—you had a note from her to-day,
I am afraid she recalls you home, and I shall be left
quite alone! Do you reckon Mr. Falkland <HI>nobody?</HI>
said I; I thought we had always allowed him to be
<HI>somebody.</HI> She forced a reluctant smile, her cheeks
again stained with crimson. He talks of going away
this evening.—A sigh, which she endeavoured to
suppress, divided the last word. And will you let
him, Dolly? Does not your mama charge you not
to suffer him to depart till he is perfectly recovered?
Mr. Price says he is very well, she answered, neither
does he himself complain; I would not detain him
for the world. How ridiculous are your scruples,
my dear! mind what your mama says. I had Mrs.
Arnold's letter still in my hand; I read over the
whole paragraph relative to Falkland, I read it with
good accent and good discretion. Oh, Edward, you
can't imagine what advantage those few lines received
from the noble energy with which I enforced Mrs.
Arnold's favourable expressions! Agreeably as Dolly
had been impressed by them before, they now opera∣ted
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
with double force. <HI>There may be ties close as if
knit by the hand of nature!</HI> No doubt there may, said
I, pausing, with a look as if I were considering.—
There is something mysterious to me in these words
—<HI>I have the same parental affection for this boy, as if
he were really my son; and had I been blessed with one,
I should have wished him just such a youth as Orlando.—</HI>
Is it not in her power then, continued I, to give
him the <HI>relation</HI> as well as the <HI>name</HI> of son? Mrs. Ar∣nold
can herself form a tie <HI>close as if knit by the hand
of nature.</HI>—Ay, it must be so—now I understand
her meaning, and let me die if I don't think she her∣self
wishes it at the bottom of her heart, though the
cruel ill-grounded prejudices of the world have
thrown a bar in the way, which your mama, from a
way of thinking a little too much confined (pardon
me the expression, Dolly) has not courage enough to
leap over.—Suppose that she were to know that this
Orlando, <HI>so precious to you all</HI> is particularly so to <HI>one</HI>
of her family, don't you think in that case so indul∣gent
a mother—Good God! interrupted Miss
Arnold, clapping her hands before her face, whither
are you running? You rave, Sophy, you talk of im∣possibilities!
Oh no, no, no, say no more, say no
more, I conjure you,—I saw the tears trickling
down between her fingers. 'Tis the interest I take
in what so nearly concerns your happiness, my dear
Miss Arnold, said I, that makes me talk thus; can
you be angry with me for wishing to see your heart
at ease? Vain, vain wish! said she, drying her eyes,
yet I thank you for it; I know it proceeds from your
love to me, (she threw one of her arms round my
neck) yet I am sure, were you in my place, you
would act just as I intend to do.—And how is that,
my dear? To keep from all the world, except perhaps
such a faithful friend as yourself, the knowledge of a
secret which terrifies me every time I think of it—
And why terrify you, Dolly? Is there a crime in
loving? Not in the thing itself, she replied; but
to <HI>me</HI> 'tis the crime of our first parents, 'tis
the sin of disobedience. Yet the forbidden fruit is
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
so tempting, Dolly! positively, if I were not your
friend, I should be your rival, for I do think Falk∣land
a bewitching creature. What eyes the toad has!
And yet (withdrawing her arm from my neck) <HI>you</HI>
would not have him yourself, Miss Audley, were you
circumstanced as I am. Upon my life I would, if I
had such an independent fortune as you have. What,
(with a look of surprize mingled with curiosity) con∣trary
to your mama's approbation? I do not abso∣lutely
say that neither; I have as great a respect for
parental authority (and I kept my face admirably)
as you can have, Miss Arnold, and therefore I should
certainly <HI>try</HI> to obtain my mama's consent, and if she
would not grant it, why then—Ay, what would
become of you then, Miss Audley?—Why then,
I think I should be very apt to marry him without it.
—Mercy on me, Sophy, how madly you talk! but
I am sure you are not serious.—Why no, in that
case I believe I should be as much afraid to venture
on such a step as you would, for I should think a
parent's refusal of consent amounted to a prohibi∣tion,
and I should look upon it as a downright act
of rebellion in that child who should transgress such
a prohibition. A stisled sigh which I saw listing her
gentle bosom at that word, encouraged me to pro∣ceed.—But
I'll suppose matters situated with me,
just as they are with you; I will suppose my mama
to be as fond of Mr. Falkland as Mrs. Arnold is:
I'll suppose that she has but one single objection to
the giving him her daughter, and that objection by
no means to be charged on him as a fault, and that
she herself would overlook it, if it were not through
fear of the censures of medaling impertinent people,
and the resentment of an imperious brother: I hus
circumstanced, I own I should not think it any great
outrage against duty, if without hazarding a denial
from my mother, I took the man I loved, and trusted
to her tenderness to forgive a little trespass, which
had not amounted to a breach or her commands.
There was a little sophistry in this reasoning, Ed∣ward;
I learnt that knack from you. Miss Arnold
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
however saw it not, at least she was too much agita∣ted
by the tendency of my discourse to examine it.
You talk of but <HI>one</HI> objection said she; oh, Sophy,
you don't know what you are saying! I know of
none, said I, but the un'ucky circumstance of poor
Mr. Falkland's birth, which has been passed by in
hundreds who have not half his merit; for with re∣spect
to his want of fortune, where there will be so
considerable a one on your side, 'tis too mean a con∣sideration
to be balanced with so many good quali∣ties,
so many accomplishments, so amiable a person.
—Dear, dear Miss Audley, <HI>how</HI> can you talk thus?
Why, is it not all true? I grant it; but indeed your
kind zeal for me transports you beyond the bounds of
reason; you forget that all this while, the man of
whom we are speaking, never once dreamed of those
chimeras which you have been conjuring up in your
own imagination—Ha, ha! and is <HI>that</HI> the rub
then? Oh, child, it shall soon be removed, our
bowls shan't be stopped by a straw.—You don't
suppose, Edward, I said this to Dolly; have not you
been corresponding with me long enough to know
the difference between a little mental parler that I
sometimes hold with myself, and a response made
aloud? I answered Miss Arnold, He must be very
insensible then, and I believe <HI>that</HI> is one of the last
faults that we should suspect in Falkland's nature.
No, Dolly, assure yourself, if he never did before,
he must in this last visit have discovered enough of
your sentiments to encourage his hope.</P>
<P>She shuddered when I said this, as one does at the
sight of a little noxious animal to which we have
an antipathy. Lord, Miss Audley, how mean must
I appear in your eyes! And if I should do so too in
those of Mr. Falkland!—She clapped her hands to∣gether,
Oh, Sophy, I am not a match for that
reflection; I do not wish to be beloved; but indeed
I could not bear to be despised.</P>
<P>Just as she spoke this, we heard some one tap at the
door, (we were in the garden parlour) May I come
in, ladies? said Falkland, for it was he. Miss Ar∣nold
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
was too much discomposed to see him; she ran
into the adjoining room, and I bid him come in.</P>
<P>I thought Miss Arnold had been with you, Ma∣dam,
said he, and I came to bid you both good∣bye,—You
are not going away now, Sir? Yes, he
replied, Mr. Price dines at Oxford to day, and he
thinks I may as well take the opportunity of going in
the chariot with him, as defer it till evening when I
purposed to have gone.</P>
<P>My zeal for your interests, Edward, made me
cruel in that instant; I did an ill-natured thing, for
without giving poor Dolly time to recompose herself,
I called her out of the other room, from whence,
as the door stood on the jar, she had heard what was
said. She entered; I pitied her from my heart, for
she looked as pale as death. Orlando took her kindly
by the hand, What's the matter, my dear Arney?
(for so he sometimes calls her) no ill news from
Burnly, I hope! (he knew she had received a letter)
how does your mama and Cecilia do? They are
very well, she replied, but I am myself a little in∣disposed
to day. Poor Dolly, said Falkland, and
slightly kissed one of her cheeks; this easy familiar
action soon chased away the paleness from them,
He looked earnestly at her, 'Tis your too close at∣tendance
on me, said he, that has made you ill; it
were better a hundred such worthless fellows as I am
should die, than that you should lose an hour's
health. 'Tis only her want of sleep, said I; she will
be well again in a day or two. I hope so, replied Falk∣land;
I shall call on you again soon. Adieu, and
pray be well against I see you next. Good morn∣ing
to you, Miss Audley have you any commands to
Sir Edward? He made to each of us a graceful bow
and retired, and we saw the chariot drive away with
him and Mr. Price in it presently after.</P>
<P>Poor Miss Arnold! Lord! Edward, it is a sad
thing to be in love without being sure of a return,
for that is at present our case: not that I can have
the least doubt of Falkland's catching the flame if
it be communicated by a skilful hand; but to tell you
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
the truth, I have not observed any thing in him
which gives me room to believe he loves her; yet
I may be mistaken, and he may have art enough
to conceal his inclinations, where there appears so
little probability of their succeeding. She seems
now glad that he is gone, and has besought me
not to talk of him. In this I must conform to
her desires, or perhaps forfeit her good opinion,
without which nothing can be effected. It now
rests upon you to make Falkland speak for him∣self,
and I think I can answer for the consequen∣ces.</P>
<P>We are at present most intolerably humdrumish;
and if I were not the best sister in the universe, I
should leave Dolly to read Homilies to old Price,
and return home; though, by the way, my mama
has <HI>permitted</HI> me (for we writ to her) to stay here
till Mrs. Arnold's return.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>VERY near sinking, by Jupiter! If I had not
been a skilful seaman, and cried <HI>'bout ship</HI> in an
instant, we had gone souce to the bottom! You have
an excellent nose, Sophy, to use a sportsman's phrase,
and can scent out a little lurking Cupid as well as my
Basto can a hare. You were right with regard to
Miss Arnold, you are right with regard to Falkland,
for he not only does <HI>not</HI> love Dorothy; but as fortune
in her spite would have it, he <HI>loves</HI> Cecilia! Thanks
be to my better stars I am not dying for either of the
puppets, yet I <HI>will</HI> have one of them; and since my
heart has been so amenable to me as to turn out Dol∣ly
to make room for Cecilia, why should not Falk∣land's
be the same, and turn out Cecilia to make room
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
for her older sister? Ay, it must be so, the change is
easy, and it will be so extremely convenient to us all,
that I will have it so; but Falkland must not yet
know my design, for on that depends its success,
though I had like to have betrayed it, which would
have blown us all up.</P>
<P>Have you ever seen two children at play, Sophy,
delighted with the sports in which they were engag∣ed,
and galloping in full career round the room on
hobby-horses? One of them, tired perhaps of his
pastime, spies some toy that was put up on a shelf,
probably to be out of both their reaches; he climbs
to get possession of it, which the other brat no soon∣er
perceives, than he immediately dismounts, and no∣thing
will serve him but the identical bauble of his
companion; he squalls for it directly, Waugh, Sir,
it was mine first, and they fall instantly to scratching.
Thus would it have fared between Falkland and me,
had he discovered that I had any views with regard to
Cecilia; for though he never yet entertained the most
distant thought of possessing either of those girls, and
considered them, like the toy on the shelf, as things
entirely out of his reach; yet had he seen an adven∣turous
rival stretch forth his arm to seize the prize,
good bye to hobby-horses, nothing would serve him
but my play thing.</P>
<P>I'll tell you what passed between us yesterday.
Falkland, said I, I am astonished that you, who have
had such opportunities have not endeavoured to carry
off one of the Miss Arnolds. To carry <HI>off!</HI> said
he, with some surprize. Ay, her heart I mean, cri∣ed
I, for then you may be sure her person will soon
follow. You are mistaken, Sir Edward, answered he;
their mother has instilled into them such notions of
perfection, that they hardly think themselves mortal
women, and I dare say, nothing under a demi-god
would be thought worthy of them. I laugh'd, and
answer'd, Yet I will lay five hundred pounds. Falk∣land,
that had I been under the same roof with them
half as long as you have been, one of them should
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
have descended from her coelestial stilts, and been la∣dy
Audley by this time.</P>
<P>He paused a little, then asked me which of them
would have been my choice? Cecilia, answered I,
(possessed with a notion that Dolly <HI>must</HI> be his) Ceci∣lia!
he repeated eagerly, his face all in a flame. I
quickly saw how the land lay, and with an inimitable
presence of mind, Would she not be your's? cried I.
I think her a much finer girl than her sister; the
<HI>youngest</HI> is a mere baby face. He laughed now in his
turn, and re-composing his features, Faith, Sir Ed∣ward,
you startled me, said he; why the <HI>youngest</HI> is
Cecilia, for whom, had I pretensions to <HI>either</HI> of them,
I own I would give my life. I <HI>could</HI> love Cecilia
dearly, and though I have hitherto stifled a hopeless
slame, I find the thoughts of a rival would make it
blaze out. There, Sophy, you see he gave proof
to my simile.</P>
<P>Falkland, replied I, with a very serious countenance,
I could tell you a secret that a certain little bird has
whispered to me? but since I know your sentiments,
I had better keep it to myself. What is it? prithee,
tell it me. Poh, what does it signify, I'll only tell
you that <HI>I</HI> would give a limb to be as happy a man as
you are without your knowing your own good for∣tune
—I'll never forgive you, Sir Edward, if you
conceal it.—But I promised my sister not to
speak of it.—And you never broke your promise
to a lady? Ay, but this is a different cafe.—You
may keep your secret, Sir Edward, but I shan't look
upon you any longer as my <HI>friend.</HI> Suppose I should
tell you that Miss Arnold loves an insensible blind fel∣low
that never once thought of her! He appeared
thunder-struck. Miss Arnold! do you mean Dolly
or Cecilia, for you don't seem to know one from the
other? I mean her whom my sister is now with, she
who I think the handsomest, Dolly, if that be her
name. Why you amaze me, Sir Edward! What did
Miss Audley say to you? Coxcomb, said I, you
want to indulge your vanity now, by hearing at se∣cond
hand the soft confessions of one of the finest
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
creatures in the universe. Not replied he, for upon
my word (I <HI>can</HI> not yet get him to swear a little de∣cently)
if you are serious in what you say, I am ex∣tremely
sorry for it. Oh could you but have told me
this of Cecilia! 'Tis a pity, cried I, that <HI>both</HI> the
girls are not in love with you; why what a tyrant art
thou, Falkland, for if that were the case, one of
them <HI>must</HI> be unhappy.—You mistake me, answered
he; I only wish that Cecilia had for me those senti∣ments
which you say her sister has; for then—What
then, Falkland? Why then perhaps both you and I
—but it is all madness to think of it. We can nei∣ther
of us pretend to them, your <HI>fortune</HI> does not en∣title
you; and for my part, born as I am under an
anathema, I never durst entertain a hope. I have a
thousand obligations to Mrs. Arnold and I should
think it a violation of the laws of gratitude and hos∣pitality,
should I endeavour to seduce the heart of
her daughter.</P>
<P>I did not like this strain, Sophy, it favoured too
much of old Price. Yet, said I, you wished but now,
that Cecilia had for you those sentiments that her sis∣ter
has. I fancy in that case, Falkland, you would
make a little free with the laws of hospitality. At pre∣sent
you are mightily inclined to impose on yourself
for <HI>virtue,</HI> what is in reality nothing more than <HI>indif∣ference.</HI>
Suppose it were Cecilia who loved you,
would you not hazard every thing, forfeit every thing
to possess her? I dare not trust myself with the
thought! said he. That answers me fully, replied
I; where then is the difference between breaking
through forms (for that would be <HI>the very head and
front of your offending)</HI> with a view to gratify your
own passion, and the doing so in order to make a
grateful return to that of a fair lady? In one cafe,
said he, the temptation would be some excuse. And
in the other, cried I, the motive, would be a much
better. I admire Miss Arnold, said he, I love, I es∣teem
her; yet I never considered her in the light you
mention. Cecilia had early possession of my inclina∣tions,
and I had always thought she loved me better
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
than her sister did. This it was, perhaps, which
helped to conciliate my affections more to her. You
see how wrong a judgment you formed, answered I;
you were led into this error for want of being better
acquainted with the female heart Cecilia, who felt
nothing more for you than friendship, or at most a
<HI>sisterly</HI> love, gave full scope to those feelings, and as
she had no reason to hide, she let you fee <HI>all</HI> that pas∣sed
in her heart. Poor Dolly, on the contrary, con∣scious
that she felt more for you than she dared to a∣vow,
was always on her guard, and for fear of dis∣covering
the <HI>whole,</HI> perhaps concealed more than she
needed to have done.</P>
<P>I believe you are right, said he; a thousand little
circumstances now occur to me, which convince me
that you are. There was something very particular
in Miss Arnold's behaviour when I took my leave of
her yesterday. Poor girl, what a pity!—What a
pity indeed, cried I, that she should love an insensible
puppy that does not deserve her! and I swore a furi∣ous
oath at him. What would you have me do, cri∣ed
he, would it not be basely betraying Miss Arnold
to pretend a passion which I do not feel? And would
it not also be betraying my own interests, for in that
case I must for ever give up all thoughts of Cecilia?
Dolt, cried I, have you any <HI>hopes</HI> of her? At present
not the least, answered he, yet time might do some∣thing
in my favour. I build much on Mrs. Arnold's
tenderness for me; and were Cecilia to favour my
wishes, I think I should even venture to disclose them
to her mother.—And be sure of a disappoint∣ment,
interrupted I; no, no, Falkland, though a
heart in love may overlook a thousand inequalities, a
parent's cooler judgment never can.—Would there
not then, said he, be the same difficulty with regard
to one sister as to the other? Undoubtedly, cried I,
if the mother were to be consulted on the occasion.
—He was thoughtful for a while, then repeated with
a sigh, Poor Miss Arnold!</P>
<P>I dropp'd the conversation here, not-thinking it
convenient at that time to urge the subject farther.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
I have studied Falkland minutely since I have
been acquainted with him, and find he is of a ve∣ry
mixed character. The father and the mother pretty
equally blended in his composition; but I hope the
latter may predominate, else even under <HI>my</HI> prudent
guidance and example, he may sneak out of the
world without <HI>doing</HI> any thing worthy of remembrance.
“Tis harder to delineate the traces of this young man's
mind, than of any one's I have ever yet known. I
have sometimes thought this proceeded from the same
cause that extremely delicate faces are the hardest to
be drawn. He has no strong lines in his foul, and if
I may use the expression, all the features of it are
faint. I do not think him capable of a manly or
steady friendship towards one of his own sex, or of a
violent or constant attachment towards one of your's;
yet is he the most engaging and agreeable companion
in the world amongst men, and would, (to a woman)
I dare say, appear a warm and sincere lover. He
likes pleasure, yet enters not into it with that juve∣nile
ardour so natural to one of his age; he even
sometimes commits excesses, but it seems as if he
were led into them more from the force of example,
than the strength of his passions. He is at times idle
without being dissipated, and at others busy without
being studious. He will deny no favour that you can
ask of him; yet he appears not much obliged for those
which are granted to him. In short, he does the best
and the worst things with equal indifference. He
loves expence, yet he by no means despises money;
and I have seen him generous and niggardly in the
same hour; hasty in forming resolutions, and as rea∣dy
to break them. He has an infinite deal of vanity;
but he has still more art in concealing it; and I be∣lieve
that I am the first who ever discovered that he
had either. With all this he has very good sense, and
an address insinuating beyond any thing I ever met
with. His faults seem all complexional, so are his
virtues too, for he is neither right nor wrong upon
principle, and it appears a moot point whether nature
intended him for an angel or a devil. Such is the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
subject I have to work upon. His old tutor (whom,
he says, be believes to be as good a man as Abraham
was) has endeavoured to instill into him all his patri∣archal
notions; a few of them have stuck by him,
and it has cost me a good deal of pains to root out
others; but I must clear the ground entirely of weeds,
for such I consider prejudices of all kinds, and then
I think I can sow it with what feeds I please.</P>
<P>When he first came to college he was very unto∣wardly,
and, to say the truth, I had not much hopes
of him. Nay still, spight of all my digging and hoeing
and raking, a weed now and then pops up; he relaps∣es
into his absurd opinions, and this he calls a return
to <HI>virtue;</HI> but this is generally after a night's debauch,
when finding perhaps his head ach next morning, he
<HI>declares</HI> he'll never drink again, shuts himself up in his
chamber for three days, and I verily believe says his
prayers. I commonly letthose penitential fits work
off, as I would those of an ague, and then I apply my
remedy; by which means I hope in time to effect an
absolute cure. His conscience seems to be troubled
with an intermitting fever, but I perceive already the
returns of it are less frequent, and the paroxysms of a
shorter duration.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that Mrs. Arnold has a high opi∣nion
of him; persons who are endowed with a plau∣sible
exterior, and who are not agitated by violent
passions, may impose on more discerning eyes than
generally fall to the share of ingenuous minds. Let
this account for what you seem so much surprized at
in your last letter, viz. that Mrs. Arnold, with all her
penetration, could never fee into the character and
designs of a <HI>certain friend</HI> of ours; whom, in all com∣panies,
she declares to be the <HI>best</HI> of women! Don't
you know that old Price is her almoner to dispose of
her little private charities? Then his conversation is
<HI>so</HI> edifying! Lord, what would <HI>she</HI> give to have such
a worthy divine under the fame roof with her! 'Tis
true her ladyship has the misfortune of having a rake∣helly
young fellow to her son, but what then? The
worthiest of parents may have, wild children; besides,
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Sir Edward is very young, he <HI>may</HI> reform, and yet
make an excellent man. Oh, no doubt, if it pleases
heaven to make such a reformation.—Mean while
poor lady Audley <HI>discountenances</HI> him as much as pos∣sible,
and even very rarely allows him to visit her.
Such a conduct may be thought somewhat rigorous by
tender mothers, 'tis true, but for <HI>her</HI> part she should
always prefer her <HI>duty</HI> to her feelings.—Now,
Sophy, do you wonder any longer? But to return to
our own affairs. I think 'tis meet that Miss Arnold should
he persuaded that Falkland loves her. You are very
good at starting a hint, but I am your only operator
to improve upon it. I therefore send you a pretty
maidenly epistle inclosed, which you may let your
friend see in whatever manner your discretion shall
direct. You must in return write me a letter fit for
Falkland's eye. I will not affront your sagacity by
enlarging on the utility of this step; I shall only re∣mind
you that it will give me an opportunity of
renewing a conversation, which I could not well be
the first to re-assume, without creating some suspi∣cions
of a design.—Sophy, I must succeed in
this affair, or I am <HI>undone,</HI> that's all.</P>

<P>YOU reproach me, my dear Sophy, for absenting
myself from Woodberry. Falkland was punc∣tual
in delivering to me your menaces; but you ought
rather to commend my caution than to blame my
coldness. I love you, and I respect Miss Arnold;
but I owe something to my own peace, and therefore
think it prudent not to indulge inclination where hope
is forbid. The unhappy, they say, find relief in the
society of those who are as miserable as themselves;
if this be so, I have at least one consolation, for I find
I am not the only wretch who must sigh in vain. Your
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
tyrant friend <HI>has</HI> a lover, though perhaps she little
suspects it, of whom the prou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of her sex might
boast! but he shall never grace her triumphs. Hope∣less
of success, he has hitherto wisely concealed his
love; nor should even <HI>I</HI> have discovered it, if I had
not made him the confidant of my own; then it was
he frankly acknowledged himself to be a fellow suf∣ferer.
Sophy, I trust you with a secret that you must
not let transpire. Falkland, poor Falkland, (easy and
chearful as you have always seen him) pines in secret
for that—I won't call her names, yet I could
hate her for her hypocrisy. Yes, Sophy, she is a hy∣pocrite,
for who that looks in her face would think
her cold or insensible? Yet I do not so much blame
<HI>her,</HI> as I do Mrs. Arnold. Her mistaken zeal for the
preservation of Falkland's morals, has exposed his
heart to inevitable evil. How was it possible for him
<HI>not</HI> to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and is it not next to a miracle that he is
not beloved again? I own to you fairly, had I known
the state of his heart sooner, Miss Arnold should ne∣ver
have enrolled <HI>my</HI> name amongst the list of her
slaves.</P>
<P>Had he hopes of success, I should envy, and per∣haps
love him less; but I could not be villain enough
to endeavour to supplant him, as I consider his claim
as of elder birth than my own. At present we have
nothing to do but sit down and condole with each o∣ther;
yet I wish I could persuade him to follow my
example, and by diverting his thoughts with other
objects, try to turn them from that which now so
much engrosses them; but he is a romantick fool, so
I must leave him to his fate. For my part, I intend
to give myself but another week to whine like a dri∣veller.
I will then, like a fierce demoniac, snap my
chains at once, exorcise the demon Love to quit mine
and take possession of some other devoted breast, leav∣ing
me free to make a happier choice. Oh, how I
shall exult when I cry out.</P>

<OPENER>Miss AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 24th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CHARMING creature! incomparable brother!
how I envy you the glory of your contrivance!
It <HI>ought</HI> to have been <HI>mine;</HI> 'tis too good for any <HI>man</HI>
living. Had there been a word more, or a word less,
it would not have done: had you treated Miss Arnold
with more decorum, or been more guarded in your
expressions, it would not have done; had you used
more freedom, it would not have done; for then I could
not have let her see your letter; but you mixed your
ingredients to a nicety▪ yet with all your skill, it still
would not have done, if it had not been for my dex∣terity
in the application; for let a recipe be ever so
well prepared, there may be a little skill necessary in
administering the potion, or the patient may lose the
good effects of it.</P>
<P>I have taken three days to answer your <HI>maidenly</HI>
epistle, as you call it; (very maidenly it is, no doubt,
because you did not swear in it) for, you must know,
Dolly did not see it till this very day, as I have been
ever since I received it pondering with myself in what
manner I could best communicate it to her. Falk∣land's
<HI>name</HI> was not to be mentioned: I could not,
therefore, infringe this her <HI>command,</HI> without her real∣ly
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
being, or affecting to be, displeased at it; and this
might have produced some consequences not at all
desirable.</P>
<P>You see, therefore, your letter must have been ab∣ruptly
introduced, under an apparent breach too of
the confidence you reposed in me. Chance some∣times
does for us what neither our own industry nor
art could effect. I actually dropped your letter, with∣out
any design, and Dolly, by the luckiest hazard,
picked it up on the stairs, where I had flirted it out
of my pocket with my handkerchief in going down.
She brought it to me directly, folded up as it was.
I no sooner cast my eyes on it, than knowing it to be
yours, a mixture of surprize and joy made the colour
mount up to my eyes, and, without knowing what I
did, I snapped it eagerly from her. So unaffected a
confusion could not fail of creating some suspicion.
Ah, Sophy, cried Miss Arnold, I see we are not up∣on
equal terms; you have secrets which you conceal
from me. You think this is from a lover, replied I;
indeed, my dear, you are mistaken; 'tis only from my
brother.—Why that blush then, Sophy? why that
keen impatience to have it restored? Because, said I,
(affecting a little of that embarrassment which I really
felt before) because—look, this is his hand on
the superscription—Because—because—said
she, smiling, how should I know Sir Edward's
hand? I'll shew you his name at the bottom, at least
the two first letters of it. I unfolded the letter; she
observed the verses: Poetry, as I live! ah, little
dissembler, 'tis not from your brother—See his
name at the bottom—There may be more E. A.'s
than Sir Edward Audley; you could not have been
so agitated, had it come from him. I made her look
at the conclusion, doubling down the other parts.
She read, <HI>The pains of unrequited love.</HI> Sophy, this
cannot be from your brother. Why not, Dolly,? has
he not reason to complain of a certain person? This
seemed to recover her from her doubts. I dare say,
said she, he is very severe upon me in it, which made
you so unwilling that I should see it: prithee tell me
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
what he says; for I can take nothing ill of such a
mad-cap. Well, said I, if you will promise not to
be angry, I will shew it to you; though my brother
would never forgive me, were he to know it. I put
it into her hands. She saw by the date it had been
written three days; and her manner of finding it,
joined to my behaviour, left her not the least room to
suspect there was any artifice in the case.</P>
<P>She read it attentively. Here was a copy, Edward,
to have exercised a painter's skill; her ingenuous coun∣tenance
speaking all the various passions of her soul. He
is right, said she; perfectly right with a composed look
and voice, as she read the first paragraph of your let∣ter;
yet I should always be glad to fee Sir Edward as
a friend. I watched her as she proceeded to the next,
where you say, <HI>The unhappy find relief,</HI> &amp;c. and I heard
her breathe a sigh, in pity even of thee, thou traitor.
Indeed, I am very sorry, said she, her soft eyes still <HI>more</HI>
softened by compassion, at the thoughts of your pre∣tended
sufferings. But now came the touch-stone,
<HI>Your tyrant friend has a lover,</HI> &amp;c. I saw surprise, cu∣riosity,
and impatience take possession of every feature;
she seemed to devour the lines with her eyes: but
when the name of <HI>Falkland</HI> struck them, what a glow
then brightened her face! a blush is too poor a word;
I never saw her look so beautiful! Good God, said
she, can this be possible! She paused a little, her eyes
beaming with lustre. She read on—A hypocrite, does
Sir Edward call me? how much does your brother
wrong me in his opinion! Sophy, you know I am nei-<HI>cold</HI>
nor <HI>insensible.</HI> She returned to your letter; Poor
Falkland! dear Orlando! broke involuntarily from her
lips. Sir Edward blames my mama here, continued
she; but how could she foresee, that in her pious care
of an unhappy orphan, she, was laying up misery for
him, and her weak imprudent daughter? Yet I have
heard her say, that there was a fatality in all her
actions, and that her best designs had been perverted
into evil. It will be her own fault, said I, if this
should be rendered so. She only shook her head; when
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
coming, to the conclusion of your letter, she smiled, and
said, she loved you for your spirit in resolving to think
no more of her; adding, that she was very sure you
would not find it difficult to keep your resolution. I
replied, My brother has a very vulnerable heart;
at the same time he is so volatile, that I should not be
surprized if I were to see him in love with some one
else in a month or two; (I said this by way of a pre∣paratory
step for your attack on Cecilia) yet, con∣tinued
I, were he to meet a kind return, I know it
would fix him; and the plains of Arcadia never saw a
renderer or a more constant swain than Sir Edward
might then be made. There was a pretty speech for
you! I hope, replied Miss Arnold, he may then soon
meet with a lady who will deserve and return his af∣fection.
But let me now ask you one question, Sophy;
Have you written to your brother since you received
this letter? I saw the tendency of her question, and
was prepared with an answer; yet I hesitated as if I
were not. Have you written to Sir Edward? she re∣peated
—I have—Sophy, I fear, I fear you put too
much confidence in that brother of yours; yet, if you
have betrayed my secret!—I clasped my arms sud∣denly
about her neck—Dolly, I can't deceive you, yet
I <HI>must</HI> be forgiven; I will not loose my hold till you
promise me your pardon. What have you done?
cried she eagerly; tell me quickly. I have trusted my
brother, said I, with a secret which I myself disco∣vered.
I am lost then! cried she, flinging from me,
and throwing herself into another chair; Falkland by
this time knows it all! 'Twas barbarous in you, Sophy;
would I have used you so? My brother will not men∣tion
it, said I; I charged him strictly on that head.
O ridiculous supposition! cried she; do you think that
<HI>men</HI> have more virtue than <HI>we</HI> have? Don't you see
that your friendship for me got the better of your side∣lity
to your brother, and you communicated to me
what he charged you to conceal! I seemed to be struck
dumb with this reproach, and the truth of the observa∣tion
—but recovering myself; He has not the same rea∣sons
to excuse a breach of trust, nor the same motives
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
for committing it. I was overcome by your importu∣nities;
and had you not found and pressed to see my
brother's letter, I should never have mentioned Falkland
to you more. The same accident cannot befal Sir Ed∣ward;
what inducement then can he have to betray
me? This flimsy apology was (as I meant it should be)
very easily answered. Friendship for Falkland, replied
she: he loves him, and will be very glad of an op∣portunity
of telling him what he thinks will make him
happy—Again I stood in amaze at her sagacity! but
still willing to excuse my fault, I am extremely sorry,
said I, that I should have been so imprudent; but I
don't know how it is, I never <HI>could</HI> keep any thing from
my brother—And I spoke it in the tone of one who is
ashamed of their own absurdity.</P>
<P>To what have you exposed me! cried she, clasping
her hands together; how shall I bear to look Falkland
in the face, after such an <HI>unsollicited</HI> confession? Had
he remained ignorant of my weakness, time and my
own endeavours, joined to a belief of <HI>his</HI> indifference,
would have enabled me to overcome it; but now what
hope have I left? If Falkland, encouraged by what I
am sure he knows too well, should venture to declare
himself, I am undone! Sophy, you know not what
thorns you have planted here—and she laid her hands
on her bosom. Accept of my penitence, my dear
Miss Arnold, said I, and hope for the best. I was
really affected with the account my brother gave me
of poor Falkland's situation: I thought <HI>he</HI> was so too;
and (as he had no hopes himself) that the knowledge of
this secret would, far from creating any jealousy in
him, rather be a consolation, when he reflected that it
was not an <HI>unworthy</HI> rival to whom you gave the pre∣ference.
Come, prithee, my dear, dry your eyes (for
I perceived tears in them) you are the first woman, I
believe, that ever cried for finding herself adored by
the man she loved. I don't weep for <HI>that▪</HI> said she,
but to think how unhappy we must <HI>both</HI> be. Had I suf∣fered
alone; but poor Orlando—must be your husband
after all, Dolly. She smiled through her tears, and
sobbed out, A—h, Sophy, that's impossible! A good
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
deal more of pretty girlish chit-chat passed between us,
to the same purpose, till we were called down to sup∣per,
where Mr. Price's presence was a check to any
farther conversation on the subject.</P>
<P>The family are all, long since retired to bed; and
here am I, like a witch scrawling dire characters at
midnight. My chamber joins that where Miss Arnold
sleeps; but where she <HI>sleeps</HI> not at present, for I hear
her sighing. These very reserved girls, I have ob∣served,
when they <HI>do</HI> love, love unmercifully. We
lively ones, with a little dash of the coquet in us, are
mere babies to them. Another sigh! Oh, Edward,
the potion operates rarely!</P>
<P>Well, but all this while Falkland steps not forward
to meet us. We are prepared for him here; and I
shall have but a poor opinion of your abilities, if I do
not very soon see a pair of <HI>mutual</HI> lovers. If you can
once bring him to unfold his heart a little, Dolly's will
expand of itself, and we may trust to sympathy to do
the rest; but it will be absolutely necessary to engage
him in the pursuit of this amour before Cecilia's re∣turn.
Once entered, he cannot retract; and the re∣ception
he will be sure to meet with, must infallibly
fix him: for after all (putting romance out of the
question) I believe he would bless his stars to get either
of these girls.</P>
<P>I take it for granted he has not the least suspicion
that you ever made any overtures to Miss Arnold; on
which account, nothing will appear more natural than
that you should urge <HI>him,</HI> already so much favoured,
to lay hold on his good fortune; besides the indifference
you expressed towards Cecilia, will put him off his
guard there too; so that it will be impossible for doubts
of any kind to awaken his jealousy: and once there
comes to be a reciprocation of vows between him and
his love, (for that I expect will soon be the case) he
cannot be such a snarling cur as to stand between you
and a good to which he has given up all pretensions.
Dolly, on the other hand, very probably, will not be
sorry to see her sister in the same predicament with her∣self.
We are all Eves, brother, and are ready to
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
stretch out the apple to our friends of which we our∣selves
have tasted. You know Mrs. Arnold thinks her
daughters as safe with my mama as with herself; we
shall, therefore, have many opportunities, after they
return from Burnly, of making little parties at our own
house, till the time appointed for the young ladies go∣ing
to London; and as you mean to quit the univer∣sity
at Christmas, you may pursue your mistress the
whole winter in town; for I count upon your having
secured her heart before she leaves Woodberry. I am
quite tired with writing so long a letter; yet I will not
go to bed till I have scribbled a short one for Falkland
to see. It will require no management in the world to
shew it to him, but all the skill of which you are ma∣ster
to make it produce proper effects. You will have
it inclosed; so adieu—</P>
<Q>P. S. The servant who brings you this attends Mrs.
Nelson to town; who having ten thousand things
to buy, it will take her up almost the whole morn∣ing;
so that you may order him to call on you be∣fore
he returns home; and by that time, per∣haps,
you may be able to tell me how my billet
worked.</Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">(Which was inclosed in the preceding.)</HEAD>
<P>'TIS almost a fortnight since I have seen you, and
yet you are within five short miles of me.
Indeed, brother, you are very unkind, and I almost
begin to think you have no affection for me. You
ought to consider the melancholy life I lead here: I see
no body but a few primitive people whom Mrs. Ar∣nold
has selected for her acquaintance. As for poor
Dolly, she is become such a mope, that she is really
fit company for no one but herself; and if I did
not love her dearly, I would not sacrifice my hours
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
to her. Poor dear creature! I pity her from my
heart.</P>
<P>Upon my word, Edward, I begin to be seriously
alarmed for her; for I think her health is daily im∣pairing.
Would to God, she had never known a cer∣tain
friend of yours, or that he was in a situation that
would take off all objections to him; but as that is
never likely to be the case, if you have any regard to
the peace of the family in which I now am, or set any
value en my friendship, take care never to let drop the
smallest hint of what I intrusted to your confidence;
for if any improper consequences should ensue (as no
doubt there would) I should certainly be suspected
by Mrs. Arnold as an abettor in her daughter's impru∣dence;
for I know not to what lengths Dolly's uncon∣querable
attachment might carry her, if Falkland were
to know and avail himself of it.</P>
<P>Her mama talks of sending for her to Burnly, as she
knows not when she shall be able to disengage herself
from lady V—I wish she would, as it would at the same
time help to divert <HI>her</HI> mind, and deliver me from a
confinement of which I am quite tired. Dolly does
not seem to relish the thoughts of going; but I have a
great inclination to get my mama to write to Mrs.
Arnold to send for her. She need only be told of that
melancholy which is preying on her mind, to hurry
her away directly. She will attribute it, no doubt, to
her being, for the first time, absent from her friends.
How much does poor Miss Arnold envy that little
sprightly gipsey Cecilia! Mrs. Arnold says she is the
life of the whole family at Burnly; and that her con∣stant
flow of spirits supports that of her mama, as well
as of Mrs. and Miss Darnley. Happy girl! she is a
stranger to that tyrant who commits such ravages in the
bosom of her poor sister.</P>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Edward, send me some books,
and some news. Tell me who and who's together at
Oxford: pick up all the anecdotes you can get, both
good and bad, cram them into your budget, and
empty the contents of it at Woodberry within these

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>NOW, by St. Paul, the work goes bravely on—</HI>
I was in bed when I received your packet; and
having read the great letter and the little letter, (the pre∣cious
engine of our designs, I bethought me of a curious
expedient, which I instantly put in practice. I bounded
out of bed, threw on my night-gown and slippers, and
having nicely picked off the seal from your inclosed
billet, I as nicely clapped on a fresh one; then giving it
to David, I bid him follow me in a quarter of an hour
to Mr. Falkland's chambers, and give it to me there.
Have not you it already, Sir, said David, what occa∣sion
is there for my bringing it to you again? Do as I
bid you, you dog, and ask no questions. I then saun∣tered
into Falkland's room, whom I found just up.
Give me some coffee, quoth I, and threw myself into
his easy chair. Just as we began our breakfast, David
entered, and with a very grave face, and a low bow,
presented me your letter; but thinking himself in a
plot, he could not refrain from tipping me a sly wink,
which it was happy for the repose of his bones that
Falkland did not observe. Having read it, I tossed it
down carelesly on the table. <HI>An Italian scrawl,</HI> said
Falkland, looking at the lines backwards; <HI>which</HI> of
them is it from? (for I have other ladies who write to
me besides you, Sophy.) If you have any curiosity,
said I, you may read it; for the mischief is done al∣ready,
and cannot be made worse by a farther commu∣nication.
He took the letter up, and I could observe
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
by the rogue's face as he read, that his vanity was not
a little flattered. He rose from his chair without speak∣ing,
and walked up as it were mechanically to the glass,
where having taken a survey of his own dear irresistible
figure; You can't imagine, said he, turning round with
a very solemn face, how much I am affected with this
account which your sister gives of poor miss Arnold, I
wish indeed, as miss Audley says, that we had never
known each other. It would have been happy for <HI>her,</HI>
said I, tossing off my dish of coffee; but I hope her
mother will send for her into Lancashire, and by way
of curing her melancholy, clap up some hasty match
for her, as old lady Bidulph did for Mrs. Arnold. How
I should laugh at you, Falkland, if we were to see her
return a bride? Poh, cried he, how can you jest upon
so serious an occasion? I would not for the world that
any constraint should be laid on poor miss Arnold's in∣clinations;
but I am sure her mama is too fond of her,
and has besides too much humanity to be capable of
exercising any tyranny towards her children. I would
not trust to that, said I, if her mama were to know
how <HI>wisely</HI> her daughter has bestowed her heart;
and if my mother should pick the secret out of Sophy,
(who by the bye has not the gift of retention) she would
think herself bound in duty to tell it. Then the old
gray noddles at Burnly (lady V—'s and Mrs. Darnley's
I mean) would be laid together to prevent the <HI>mischief,</HI>
as they would call it, and they would be for giving their
musty advice to Mrs. Arnold, who, good woman as
she is, would, I believe, as you observe, were she left
to herself, be far from acting tyrannically. Then we
should have Sir George Bidulph, with his overbearing
insolence, blustering all the poor women into a state of
petrefaction; and lady Sarah, screwing up her mouth,
would be <HI>astonished</HI> how a young person <HI>allied</HI> as her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ece is, could forget herself so far as to condescend
—Hold, Sir Edward, cried. Falkland, stop
where you are. Fortune has indeed cast me beneath
miss Arnold, in depriving me of the inheritance of my
ancestors, else where's the mighty difference? I believe
the name of Falkland is at least as respectable as that
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
of Arnold, and perhaps Bidulph into the bargain.
Doubtless, said I; I was not speaking my own senti∣ments,
but those of lady Sarah, who you know is one
of the proudest women in England. Curse her pride!
cried he. With all my heart, said I, (glad to hear the
lad utter so sensible a sentence.) I despise it, continued
he, as much as I do the arrogance of her husband, who
always affected, even in my childhood, to treat me as
a wretch whom his sister's charity preserved from pe∣rishing;
but there may come a day of retaliation. I wish,
said I, for I hate Sir George most cordially, that both
the girls would run away with two such idle fellows
as you and I; I think that would mortify him com∣pletely,
for I know he will be for clapping a coro∣net
on each of them, merely for the pleasure of saying,
My niece lady such-a-thing, though the title were lady
Beelzebub.</P>
<P>I saw Falkland was full of indignation; he walked
backwards and forwards two or three times, then taking
up your letter again, which still lay on the table, and
running it over a scond time, And so, said he, <HI>miss</HI> Ce∣cilia
is the life of the family at Burnly. I wish she would
spare a little of her vivacity to her poor sister. The
<HI>miss</HI> was emphatical, and I perceived he was nettled at
the judicious hint which you threw in with regard to
Cecilia's happy indifference</P>
<P>But what is the meaning, Sir Edward, said he, that
you don't go and see miss Audley? I think she really
has reason to complain of you. Why truly, Falk∣land,
answered I, I don't think a <HI>sister</HI> an inducement
quite strong enough to turn a man from more agree∣able
engagements. If I had the same motives for vi∣siting
there that you have, probably she would have less
cause to complain. Ay, but compassion, Sir Edward;
suppose we were to go to Woodberry this afternoon,
just to ask the ladies how they do? With all my heart,
said I, yawning and stretching myself out at full length
in the arm-chair.—What time shall we go? said he.
Oh, when you will; about five o'clock, I sup∣pose.—Falkland,
will you lend me this book? point∣ing
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
to a collection of poems that stood on the chim∣ney-piece.</P>
<P>I left him here; and now, Sophy, you may expect
to see Falkland at the above-mentioned hour; but not
your humble servant you may depend on it. Your
messenger has just this minute called on me, so I hurry
him off with a heap of trumpery pamphlets for a
blind; but remember I expect a good account of this
same visit.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EDWARD, I am not amorous enough to enter
into the spirit of a love scene, and had any eclair∣cissement
been brought about, I should have laid down
my pen in despair, for I would not attempt to describe
the sublime folly of a pair of happy lovers met toge∣ther.
I shall however, I think, be able to paint the
moderately silly scene that passed here this evening.
Trust not to Falkland's representation, but take it
from my faithful hand.</P>
<P>He arrived here a little before six. Miss Arnold and
I were sitting at work in her dressing-room. Mr. Price,
according to custom, gone to take his evening's nap.
We heard Orlando coming up stairs, talking to, and ca∣ressing
Miss Arnold's little lap-dog, who ran to meet
him. There's Mr. Falkland, said I; Dolly turned
pale, and instantly took out her smelling-bottle, which
I believe prevented her from fainting. The footman
threw open the door, and in darted the triumphant
varlet blooming as a cherub; the wind as he rid had
heightened his colour and blown his auburn hair a∣bout
his cheeks; he really looked insufferably hand∣some.
Poor Dolly made him a very low curtsie, unable
to speak. He addressed me first, then advancing to
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
her with something in his air that I never observed be∣fore,
I hope, ma'am, you are perfectly recovered from
your indisposition since I saw you last? <HI>Madam</HI> was a
new expression. She answered in the same strain, I am
much better, Sir, only to-day I have had a little return
of the head-ach. Falkland looked earnestly at her; her
conscious eyes, unable to meet his, were cast down to
the ground. He took the work she was doing out of
her hand; (it was a purse which she intended for him)
Extremely pretty, he said it was, so well fancied! but
would not working make her head worse? and he held
it behind his back. It is for you, said I, that she is so
busily employed. For me, my dear creature! then I
insist on your laying it by, at least that you do no more
of it whilst I am here. Miss Arnold blushed excessive∣ly;
but suffered him to put her work into a little basket
that lay on the window. He did this with that sort of
authority which a man assumes even in trifles where he
knows he has power. Dolly looked exceedingly silly,
having nothing now to take off her attention from Falk∣land.
He said he should be obliged to her for a dish
of tea, and she flew to ring the bell with an alacrity
which shewed her readiness to prevent, if possible, his
smallest wish.</P>
<P>I enquired after you: He is a sad lazy fellow, said
Falkland; I proposed to him that we should both wait
on you together this evening, and he promised to come
with me; but when the appointed hour arrived, no Sir
Edward was to be found. I suppose some vagary
came across him, which made him forget his en∣gagement.</P>
<P>The tea was brought up, which a little relieved Miss
Arnold from the awkwardness of her situation, as it
afforded her something to do; but how different was
this from our former little parties! Nothing entertain∣ing,
nothing instructive, nothing even lively was said
of either side; in short, neither of them spoke a word
of common sense, a visible constraint chained both
their tongues; and Falkland who has as much vivacity,
and Dolly who has as good an understanding as any
one, appeared each under greater disadvantages than
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
ever I saw them. Yet I could perceive that Falkland
was not inattentive to his deportment; (what designing
wretches you men are!) the creature contrived to be a∣miable
in every attitude into which he threw himself,
and when their eyes happened to encounter, he had
the impudence to blush; ay, the <HI>impudence,</HI> for it was
not modesty; while, on the contrary, the answering
vermillion that mantled in the cheeks of Miss Arnold,
was laid on by the innocent hand of bashfulness. He
asked, Were there any hopes of Mrs. Arnold's speedy
return? No, Dolly replied, she can't yet leave poor
lady V—; my mama is to be pitied in so melancholy a
situation. Your sister must have but a dull time of it,
said the fly toad, over-doing the thing from a conscious
knowledge of what I had written to you on that head.
I should have thought so too, said Dolly; but my
mama writes me word that Cecilia's constant chearful∣ness
is the only resource which supports my mama's
own spirits. This was a most fortunate reply. Falk∣land
was silent for a little while, then with an expres∣sion
in his looks, which said in plain English, <HI>I know
you love me, and I am almost inclined to return it,</HI> he
answered, Some people are happy through insensibility;
I wish I could change hearts with Cecilia. A fort
of a half sigh which he blew away, conveyed even
more than he spoke. Whether this was drawn from
him at the thoughts of Cecilia's indifference, or
through compassion to her sister, I can't pretend to
say.</P>
<P>Dolly's confusion was too apparent to be concealed;
she leaned her head on one of her hands, resting her
fine turned arm on the tea-table, her eyes half closed;
and I thought that Falkland gazed at her with a mix∣ture
of tenderness, gratitude, and pity. This seemed
a lucky crisis, and I thought might be productive
of something, if a third person were not present. I
rose from my chair. Where are you going? cried
Miss Arnold, starting from her reverie. Only for some
thread to finish my work, said I, (for I had pretended
to be fiddling at it all the time we were at tea.) Pray,
my dear, work no more this evening, said she, let us
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
go and take a turn in the garden. I must go for my
hat then, I replied. She looked embarrassed, as if a∣fraid
of being left alone with Falkland, and rising up, said
she also would go for her's, and accordingly followed
me out of the room.</P>
<P>What's your opinion, said she, taking me by the arm
as we entered my chamber, has your brother been
faithful to you or not? I know not, I replied; but of
thus much I am sure, that Falkland has betrayed the
lover more than once this evening. I thought so too,
answered she; Oh, Sophy, where, where will this
end? In your mutual happiness I hope, my dear. Oh,
no, which ever way I cast my eyes, happiness has
turned her back upon me. Sophy, I charge you ne∣ver
leave me when Falkland comes to visit us, for I tell
you once more, I have no security but in his silence.
I wish my mama would return, or send for me to
Burnly, 'twere better I were in my grave than that
I should overturn the hopes and the peace of my whole
family.</P>
<P>When we went back to the room where we had
left Falkland, we found, Mr. Price with him. They
had entered upon some literary subject, in which the
pupil seemed to acquit himself very much to the satis∣faction
of his tutor. The old man joined us in our
walk into the garden, so that nothing more to the
purpose passed for the rest of the afternoon; only
I could observe that Falkland in bidding Miss Arnold
adieu, looked—I don't know how; but not as he
used to do.</P>
<P>Old Price entertained us with his praises all supper∣time,
and Dolly seemed so delighted, I thought two
or three times she would have kissed the old man.</P>
<P>Edward, if this affair should turn out unfortunately,
I should never forgive myself for the part I have
acted in it; for next to your happiness I really wish
that of poor Miss Arnold. Yet at worst, I cannot see
any great harm that can ensue, but a little <HI>fracas</HI> in the
Arnold family; and if they should be so obstinate as
never to take her into grace again, she has a fortune in
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
her own power sufficient to make her happy with the
man she loves.</P>
<P>As for Cecilia, if you can win her affections, which
I am partial enough to you to think very probable, I
believe you would not find it difficult to obtain her.
She loves gaiety, and, by the bye, is a little weary of
restraint; and one thing I am sure of, as she has more
spirit than her sister, she will not have a choice imposed
on her by her friends, of which she herself does not
approve. I remember once when we girls were talking
over Mrs Arnold's unfortunate story, Cecilia blamed
her grand-mama Bidulph's scruples with regard to Mr.
Falkland, the father of your friend, and went so far
as to say that she thought her mother had made too
great a sacrifice to duty, in giving him up so easily.
This makes for you, Edward; she is not so much ter∣rified
at the thoughts of a giddy fellow as her sister is;
besides, really I think your family and rank in life might
very fairly entitle you to either of them, so that (ab∣stractedly
from the absolute necessity you are under of
getting twenty thousand pounds <HI>some</HI> where, and which
is not to be found under every stone) I am far from
looking upon an alliance as an injury to the family,
not even to Sir George Bidulph's saucy looks, and lady
Sarah's pinched nose.</P>
<P>I have left Dolly reading politicks to the old dryad,
whose eyes begin to fail him, and have stole up stairs
to scribble. I shall dispatch this to you early in the
morning by my flying-post, as I call Jerry, and
you may return me a line by him to inform me how
Falkland's pulse beats, if you have seen him since his
visit here.</P>
<Q>P. S. I had almost forgot to tell you that Dolly
and I had half an hour's chat by ourselves after
Falkland was; gone, for I am now no longer for∣bid
to speak of him; the case is altered, our fears
of his indifference are at an end. The poor girl
finds herself plunged in deeper than before, and
wonders at the cause; for <HI>she is affected beyond
measure at the thoughts of his being as wretched as
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
herself.</HI> Hang me if I believe her; the pleasure
of being beloved again, more than counterba∣lances
her sears for the consequences, and I be∣lieve
at this minute she does not well know
whether she is sorry or glad.</Q>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A Few words, Sophy, and no more. Falkland
supped with with me last night, and after hav∣ing
railed at me for breaking my engagement, which
I excused my own way, he told me what passed in
yesterday's interview pretty nearly as you related it;
only with a few additions suggested, I suppose, by
his own vanity; for he said Miss Arnold look'd so
pale and languishing that it grieved him to the
heart, and he could <HI>kill</HI> himself for being the cause.
Coxcomb, muttered I to myself, what pity it is thou
canst boast of such a conquest! The thing was now
so apparent, he said, that a man must be blind not to
see it; and the lady must think him very stupid, or
very ungrateful, if he did not at least appear sensible
of the honour she did him. Very true, Falkland,
undoubtedly, the laws of humanity, the laws of ci∣vility
demand so much from you. For though it is
the farthest in the world from my thoughts, said he,
to take any advantage of her tenderness, yet surely I
may make her a return of friendship and esteem,
though I mean to go no farther. By all means, said
I; or suppose you were to throw in a little <HI>Platonic</HI>
love, there can be no harm in that either; two se∣raphims
might entertain <HI>that</HI> for each other; and
Miss Arnold seems of a turn to relish those aetherial
ardors, much better than a vulgar passion. I said
this with so grave a countenance and tone of voice,
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
that he did not find me out. I am much of your
mind, replied he; and if I thought it would contri∣bute
to her happiness, I would pay her my Platonic
adorations with all my soul, for I have absolutely no
designs upon her person, though I think her very
handsome, but Cecilia has been beforehand with her
in my heart. Well, prithee, said I, take compassion
on the poor girl; you may make love to her in
blank verse; (for a man is never serious but in prose)
and if she allows you the privilege of kissing the
tip of her little finger, (though I believe even that
is beyond the bounds of Platonism) you must seem in
raptures with the favour, and speak of it as the ulti∣mate
of your wishes. This will soothe her and divert
you, and no harm can come of it; and so here's
Dolly Arnold's health. We both drank it, and he
seems pleased with the conceit. Yet 'tis such a sly
varlet, that even my plummet, which is not a short
one, cannot fathom him to the bottom; for whether
he really means to pursue this hint, or pretended to
adopt it merely to save his credit with me, after his
former declarations. I am at a loss to determine;
but be it which way it will, the success is equally
sure, for I never knew a pair of seraphic lovers who
did not bring matters to a very earthly conclusion
in the end, no matter what their designs were at set∣ting
out. I think it only now remains to contrive
opportunities for Falkland to express his <HI>disinterested
friendship,</HI> and <HI>exalted esteem</HI> for Miss Arnold, with∣out
any witnesses. I wish the venerable Price would
take a nap for the remainder of the summer, for he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
very much in our way; yet he sometimes dines
abroad; can't you give me notice of those days, and
I'll engage for Falkland's attending you on them?
depend upon it he will not want much spurring; I
shall turn his vanity to good account. And then you
know, Sophy, you must sometimes pay your duty to
your mama, why not <HI>that</HI> day as well as another?
You had absolutely promised before, and your mama
will take it ill if you disappoint her. As for my part,
I have so many whimsical engagements, that I can
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
never be at a loss to excuse myself for not going
with Falkland, if he should ask me; I don't know
whether I shan't even tell him, that having had my∣self
a little <HI>penchant</HI> for Miss Arnold, it would not af∣ford
me the least entertainment to be an humble specta∣tor
of his triumphs. There will be nothing amiss in
this, I think; yet I shall either venture it or not, as
occasion serves.—</P>
<P>Here follows a series of letters between Miss Aud∣ley
and her brother, by which it appears that Mr.
Falkland daily gained a stronger ascendency over the
heart of Miss Arnold; and if he did not altogether
adopt the Platonic system, he at least had not made
any declarations of another nature. The lady gives
her brother a circumstantial account of what passed
in every visit; some of which were contrived (tho'
without Miss Arnold's knowledge) in Mr. Price's ab∣sence;
Miss Audley herself sometimes forming pre∣tences
to be out of the way, on which occasion her
friend always told her the substance of those conver∣sations
she held with Falkland.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Audley, on the other hand, relates to
his sister what discoveries he had made in the <HI>investi∣gation,</HI>
as he calls it, of Falkland's heart, and where∣in
he hints that he still thought him devoted to Ce∣cilia.
During the course of this whole correspon∣dence,
there is manifested a surprizing deal of art,
practised by this intriguing brother and sister, in or∣der
to pervert the minds of the two young persons,
on whom they had their separate influence; in which
attempt, Sir Edward seems to have in some measure
succeeded. It appears that Miss Audley and her bro∣ther
but seldom met, which in one of her letters she
accounts for in these words, “It will not be now in
my power to see you, for as my mama is going to
the Farm with Harry, (who I think continues very
puny) I shall have no pretence for going to Ox∣ford,
as Miss Arnold knows I have no acquaintance
amongst the towns-people, and she is with me in
every other visit I make.”</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
As the above-mentioned series of letters contain a
very minute detail, which though not unentertaining,
does nevertheless not very considerably advance the
story; the editor has, to avoid swelling this collec∣tion
to too great a bulk, omitted them; and in this
place presents the reader with one from Mrs. Ar∣nold,
which he has selected from some others as that
which more immediately carries on the narrative.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Miss ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Burnly, <DATE>Sept. 3d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought to have embraced my dearest Dolly as
on this day, and am as much mortified at the dis∣appointment,
as I am sure she will be; but an un∣looked
for accident has occurred, which will detain
me here a week or ten days longer.</P>
<P>You know, I told you in my last, that lady V—
had been ordered to the Bath by her physicians.
Poor woman, she has not only lost all appetite, but
now complains of such a constant and violent pain in
her stomach, that if the waters don't relieve her,
we are apprehensive of the worst consequences. The
very day on which this journey was determined,
and fixed for the first of September, I received a
letter from lady Sarah, in which she informed me
that she was going immediately to Bath to spend a
couple of months there; that Sir George was to
call on her in his way to London, and that they
should come to town together, she <HI>hoped</HI> before Christ∣mas.
She complains of not being well; but the truth,
I believe is, she was tired of Sidney Castle, for, you
know, she hates the country. A thought unluckily
came into lady V—'s head, which has been pro∣ductive
of something that has vexed me extremely.
She begged I would write to lady Sarah, and intreat
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
the favour of her to hire a house for lady V—and
her family. As Mrs. and Miss Darnley go with her,
they do not chuse to be in lodgings, and they wished
to have a place ready for their reception against they
went down.</P>
<P>I writ immediately to lady Sarah agreeably to this
request, and was favoured directly with an answer,
wherein she tells me she has engaged a house for lady
V—, beseeching me at the same time to let Miss Ce∣cilia
come with her to Bath, as she (lady Sarah) was
quite alone, and I should make her wonderfully happy
by indulging her with her niece's company. Inconsi∣derate
woman! she values not the repose of any one
but herself. Is she not to have you both with her next
winter? and next winter may perhaps open to you
new prospects, such as probably may separate you
from your mother's arms; why then am I to be de∣prived
of my Cecilia's chearful society sooner than
there is a necessity for it? Why are you to be robbed
of your sister's company after an absence already too
long? For she adds in her letter, “I shall bring Cecilia
to London with me directly from hence, and Sir
George himself shall go down to Oxfordshire for
Miss Arnold on our return to town.”</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my dear, how this unseasona∣ble
demand has distressed me, because I cannot well
tell how to refuse it. You are no stranger to the cap∣tious
temper of lady Sarah, nor to the influence she
has over your uncle. I know I should utterly disoblige
both by a denial, and perhaps deprive you of the ad∣vantage
of being with Sir George next winter, as my
brother's actions are altogether regulated by her lady∣ship's
pleasure. Lady V—, who looks upon this as an
agreeable jaunt for any daughter, is very pressing that
I should let her go; so are the other two ladies, but
the child herself wishes to return to her sister. I can∣not,
however, excuse myself; Lady Sarah's instances
are so pressing, the opportunity so convenient, and the
company with whom she is to go, so eligible, that I
have had an unwilling consent wiung from me already.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79"/>
The house which lady Sarah has taken cannot be
ready, it seems, this week, which has postponed lady
V—s' journey, and in consequence of that my return
home; as I would fain enjoy as much of my daugh∣ter's
company as I can. She embraces you, my love,
with all her heart. Tell my Orlando I am delighted
with the account Mr. Price gives me of the progress
he is making in his studies; he shares my heart equally
with you and your sister. I hope the good old man
approves as much of you in your capacity of mistress
of a family, as he does in every thing else; and that
you have supplied my place on more important oc∣casions
than merely that of presiding at my table.
Assure Miss Audley I am highly sensible of the obli∣gation
I have to her and good lady Audley, for thus
prolonging the happiness you have received from your
young friend's amiable conversation. Adieu, my be∣loved;
my next greeting to you, I hope, will be face
to face in my own peaceful dwelling.—</P>

I should not be half so much alarmed; for constancy

<P>I'LL tell you what's to be done, Sophy; I set out
to-morrow morning post for Bath, where, getting
the start of the Burnly snails, I shall be on the spot to
receive my little divinity, and shall take care to anti∣cipate
every puppy that dares approach her. I'll dance
<HI>with</HI> her, sing <HI>to</HI> her, write verses <HI>on</HI> her, and shoot
any man through the head that looks at her. My ac∣cess
to her will be easy, as Sir George Bidulph is not

bred</HI> woman in Christendom: and if the Lancashire
family should be for putting in their <HI>whys</HI> and their
<HI>wherefores,</HI> I'll accommodate myself to them too. I'll
moralize with lady V—, lecture on housewisery with
Mrs. Darnley, and bespatter reputations with the mid∣dle-aged
maiden the daughter. Why, lord, child, 'tis
the luckiest thing that could have happened; I look
to be the idol of the whole set, and think it not at
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
all unlikely that I should trundle off Cecilia in a
Coach and six before the end of November.—Ay,
say you; but what pretence have you for taking this
journey? what will Falkland say to such a flight?
Bless me, Sophy! have not you heard that our uncle
Howel in Wales, who has been dying for these ten
years, is now going to die in good earnest? and that,
forgetting all old animosities, he is going to make his
last will, and has sent for me, his heir apparent, to
see me before his departure, and commit to my hands
the pious care of closing his eyes? You have not
heard a syllable of the matter? Hearkye, Sophy, a
word in your ear; nor I neither. I would I could.
Yet the thing must be just so; and I shall have in
ten minutes, the letter from his steward, commanding
my personal attendance, ready written in my pocket.
The short cut is from Gloucestershire across the Se∣vern;
and then, what so natural (the old gentleman
having grown somewhat better, his mind being re∣lieved
by this his prudent disposition of his worldly
affairs) what is so natural, I say, as for me, poor
young man, wearied with my constant attendance on a
sick bed, in my return to take a little trip to Bath,
by way of relaxation? for the story shall pass current
there too—Ay; but then Cecilia will write home
word that you are not only at Bath, but that you
make love to <HI>her:</HI> She tells this to Dolly, Dolly tells
it to Falkland, and then—Prithee stop, Sophy,
don't be so rapid in thy conclusions; for not a tittle
of this will come to pass. Cecilia is good humour
itself, and I need only say, My dear ma'am, pressing
her hand gently (at a ball perhaps) when you write
into Oxfordshire, if <HI>I</HI> am ever honoured with having
a single thought bestowed on me, be so good as not to
mention my being here; because I know if it should
by any means come to my mother's ears, she would
be much displeased at it, as she supposes I am still
with my uncle, though I have absolutely his permis∣sion
for returning home: but you know, ma'am, that
ladies of a <HI>certain</HI> age do not always make proper al∣lowances
for young people. I am mistaken in my
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
girl if she tells after this. The letter from Burnly,
you say, was received this day, just after Falkland
had taken his leave. He will not then know the con∣tents
of it till his next visit, which probably will not
be these three or four days; and the deuce is in it
if he can suspect, against all likelihood, that I was
before-hand with him: so that I mean to-night (for
I have not yet seen him to-day) to shew him the let∣ter
that I received from my uncle's steward (he him∣self,
poor soul, is not able to write) and I leave it to
my mother to apprize you of this my sudden journey,
as I have not a minute's time to write you a single
line So pluck up your spirits, chit; for our vessel
skims before the wind.</P>
<P>Thus far in rhodomontade, by way of answering
your querulous demand of, <HI>What's to be done, Edward?</HI>
But now to be serious; you and I consider this cir∣cumstance
of Cecilia's visit to Bath in very different
lights. Had Falkland had either love enough, or
courage enough, (for I know not in which of the
two he is most wanting) to have brought matters to a
conclusion with Miss Arnold, Cecilia's return to
Woodberry would then have been a desirable thing, as
I might, in that case, agreeably to your ideas, have
safely ventured to offer up my incense to her in some
<HI>sequestered bower,</HI> without fear of having my devotions
interrupted by any competitor for her favour. But
unsteady as Falkland is in all his purposes, and parti∣cularly
so with regard to Miss Arnold, I think, his
having her sister before his eyes (to whom I know him
attached) was a thing rather to be dreaded; and tho'
he has no hopes of her himself, he would certainly
be a bar to my pretensions. On the contrary, cut off
as he now is from the expectation of seeing her (as she
is to go from Bath directly to London) I think he will,
in all human probability, be wise enough not to lose a
substance for a shadow, but, laying hold of Miss Ar∣nold's
favourable prepossession for him, he will, in
some soft minute, determine, and declare himself.
Once fixed, he is no longer to be feared; and I may,
without reproach, pursue my fortune. I shall spend
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
all the coming winter in London, an advantage which
will be out of <HI>his</HI> power; and as I intend studiously to
cultivate lady Sarah's acquaintance, I shall at least be
always sure of a reception in town, whilst poor Falk∣land
perhaps will be glad to use my intervention with
his love; for I do not suppose the little dastard will
venture at once to run away with him. This, you
see, will make me a person of importance with Dolly;
consequently get her on my side, and engage her to
promote my interests with her sister: so that, though
things have taken a turn in some respects different
from what we expected, our main purpose remains
unchanged; and I hold it expedient that Falkland's
amour should be advanced with your best skill. Fail
not to let me know how the quicksilver rises and falls
in that variable machine—</P>
<Q>P. S. Our mama is in the secret, and you will be
<HI>properly</HI> apprized of my departure for Wales—</Q>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>Sept. 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY thing hitherto has happened precisely as
I foresaw it would—And where do you think I
am lodged? Even under the very roof with my Cecilia;
for I took care, the moment I got hither, to secure
lodgings in the same house with lady Sarah Bidulph,
who perfectly <HI>doats</HI> on me. What do you think of
that, Sophy? I would not change my knack of dis∣sembling
for an estate of five thousand a year: and I
am wife in the preference; for I should squander the
one in a year or two, and the other is an inexhausti∣ble
treasure.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
Lady Sarah (to whom I early paid my court) told
me by way of news (for I was but just arrived from
Wales) that she expected her niece in a day or two▪
'Tis very kind in your ladyship, said I, to take the
poor young creature under your own conduct; for to
say the truth, Mrs. Arnold (though she is an extreme
<HI>good</HI> woman) is not <HI>quite</HI> the pattern that one would
choose for young persons to form their manners by,
who may probably one day make a figure in the po∣lite
world—Why that's the very thing, Sir Ed∣ward;
the poor creatures are absolutely rusticated—
Oh, ma'am, they will be totally undone, if you don't
take them into your own hands; for all the world
knows your ladyship's knowledge in the science of good
<HI>breeding</HI> is superior to that of almost every woman of
quality in England—Oh, Sir, your humble ser∣vant
—I believe, indeed, (with as pleased a look
as the little crabbed countenance could assume) I have
been rather more conversant in those matters than
poor Mrs. Arnold. How do you pass your time, lady
Sarah? are there any people of fashion here at pre∣sent?
Lord, I don't know; I am but just come my∣self;
though I fancy there are but few here as yet
that one can converse with. If your ladyship has any
services to command me, I am intirely at your de∣votion.</P>
<P>We walked out together. She fell in love with a
set of china that stood in a shop window as we passed
by; but upon enquiry, finding them, as she thought,
too dear, her avarice got the better of her passion,
and she went home without buying them; but I took
care to send them to her, and was invited to drink
tea out of them the same evening.</P>
<P>When the family of Burnly arrived, having already
dedicated myself to lady Sarah, I was determined not
to lose ground by the approach of Cecilia. On the
contrary, I have made myself absolutely necessary to
them all. I go to church with lady V—, and to
market with Mrs. Darnley; for she is too notable to
trust this office to a servant. I <HI>shop</HI> it, as the ladies
call it, with lady Sarah, and bespeak caps at the
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
milliners for the girls. In short, they all allow me
to be a <HI>very modest pretty kind of young man;</HI> and if
my <HI>estate</HI> were answerable, lady Sarah should not
<HI>much</HI> dislike me for one of her nieces. This she whis∣pered
to Miss Darnley, who dropped it to her waiting∣maid,
who told it to David, who communicates
every thing to his master. But all these serve but as
a chorus to a dramatic piece: they may help to carry
on the business of the scene, but are none of them in
themselves objects of attention. The principal per∣sonage,
the heroine of the story, the Cecilia, I have
not yet been able sufficiently to draw out from
amongst this group of supernumerary figures. 'Tis
such a little flash of lightening, there is no knowing
where to have her; and if I were to be hanged for it,
I cannot at this minute divine whether she likes me
or not; but I rather suspect she does. I have been
playing my batteries on her for several days, and am
always received with good humour. I make love to
her sometimes, even before lady Sarah's face, who,
looking upon it (for that very reason) as pleasantry,
does not discourage it; but if I grow serious, as I now
and then do, when I get Cecilia in a corner, the ur∣chin
always calls Miss Darnley to her assistance, and
then the two wasps fasten on me, and sting me to
death with their flippant tongues. This is, Sophy,
but the opening of the campaign; yet I hope to re∣turn
to you crowned with laurels; and then I think,
with the help of Falkland's myrtles, we may twine a
pretty garland.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Sept. 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT an idle creature are you, brother, not to
have given me a line sooner! when you might
be very certain, that irregular as I know you to be in
your motions, I would not venture to write to you till
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
I was sure you were fixed. I believe I must allow,
after all, that though we women have livelier imagina∣tions,
you men have deeper judgments, and know
better how to deduce consequences; for our affairs
here are beginning to sall into the very track which
you foresaw and foretold. Falkland seems nettled at
Cecilia's going to Bath, instead of returning home with
her mama, as if he thought himself neglected by it;
and by way of being revenged on her for slighting a
passion of which she is ignorant, and which probably
were she to know she would contemn, he is become
more assiduous than ever with regard to Dolly. How
ridiculous is this! yet 'tis human nature, at least 'tis
the nature of you striplings. It is matter of astonish∣ment
to me, that he has not yet assumed courage
enough to declare himself; for that he has not done so
I am convinced, and Miss Arnold begins to lull her
fears asleep with a pretty idea which she has lately
taken up, viz. that there is a <HI>most perfect friendship</HI>
subsisting between them, which, if it were not for
considerations of duty, <HI>might,</HI> she owns, possibly rise
to a real passion on <HI>both</HI> sides; but checked as they
now are, they content themselves with confining their
ardor within the bounds of <HI>esteem,</HI> and desire no greater
felicity than seeing and conversing with each other. I
indulge her in this romantic folly, relying on your sa∣gacity
for what the conclusion of this fancy will be,
when opportunity serves.</P>
<P>I returned home, overwhelmed with thanks and ac∣knowledgments,
the day after Mrs. Arnold arrived at
her own house; and since that, Falkland's visits to
Woodberry have not been so frequent, for the good
lady does not approve of such repeated excursions from
<HI>our</HI> studies; but you may be sure I do not suffer a
harmless and disinterested friendship to languish for
want of the means to keep it up: therefore whenever
Dolly pays me a visit without her mama, which is
often the case, Falkland is always of the party; for
what is more natural than to ask him, who is next door
to us in a manner, to come and drink tea with his <HI>sister</HI>
Arnold? But the worst of it is, I cannot, upon those
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
occasions, contrive, with any colour of decorum, to
leave them to a <HI>tete a tete;</HI> and I don't take it to be
the mode now-a-days, as it was in times of old, for
lovers to breathe out their amorous wishes in the pre∣sence
of a confidante. I have, however, given a little
stroke, on which I pique myself, and from which I
expect wonderful good effects.</P>
<P>I was yesterday to pay Miss Arnold a morning visit.
Whilst I was with her, a letter arrived from Bath: it
was from Cecilia. Dolly opened it with impatience,
and I observed smiled as she read. What entertains you
so much? said I. Cecilia is in high spirits, said she,
and extremely pleasant in her little narratives. And
why won't you let me partake of the pleasure? She
read part of the first page of the letter to me, in which
Cecilia, in her sprightly way, gives an account of the
company, amusements, &amp;c. when coming towards the
bottom, she stopped short, skipped over some lines,
and began a paragraph at the other side. What's that
you boggle so at, Dolly? There is a secret here, said
she, which I must not divulge—Tell it me this minute?
you do nothing if you don't give me the secret.
Would <HI>I</HI> keep one from you? Ah, sy, Miss Arnold!—
She smiled again, and giving me the letter, There,
said she, there seems to be very little in it, nor can I
conceive why my sister should enjoin me secrecy;
but since she <HI>has</HI> done so, I desire, Sophy, you won't
speak of it to any one. My mama is so indulgent, she
never desires to see the correspondence which passes
between my sister and me. Cecilia, after having, by
way of raillery, talked of some conquests she had
made, says these words: “All these are but flutterers,
and I believe only <HI>pretend</HI> to like me, because I am
the fashion; but I <HI>have</HI> a lover here, who is one in
sober sadness: for when a man tries to win the good
opinion of one's friends, we may be sure he means
something more than m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re compliment. You would
be surprized were I to name him, but that I shan't
do till we meet. Mean while I have particular rea∣sons
that even thus much should not be known:
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
therefore I beg, my dear, you will not mention it to
any one whatsoever.”</P>
<P>I returned the letter to Dolly, telling her, I thought
her sister had intrusted just <HI>nothing</HI> to her confidence.
I concluded, Cecilia meant no other than <HI>you</HI> by this
nameless lover, and thought her very faithful in keep∣ing
your counsel; but I resolved at the same time to
make a proper use of the hint she had given her sister.
I engaged Dolly, with her mama's permission, to spend
the next day with me. She came accordingly this
morning; Falkland was with us; we three were in
the garden together. He asked Miss Arnold when she
had heard from her sister? Yesterday, she replied. He
hoped Miss Cecilia was well? Very well, was all Dolly's
answer. But I, who was determined he should know
a little more, blurted out, Ay, but you don't tell him
of the lover that Cecilia—Dolly looked, at me. I
clapped my hand upon my mouth, as if conscious of
having done wrong. What a blab am I! cried I. A
blab, indeed! said Dolly, a little gravely; upon my
word, Miss Audley, I will never trust you again.
Falkland coloured up to the eyes; but affecting to
laugh, Prithee, who is this lover? said he. 'Tis no∣thing
but a joke, answered Miss Arnold, yet I love
fidelity even in trifles.—I winked at Falkland, as
much as to say, Ask no more questions. He took my
meaning, and turned the conversation; but, as I ex∣pected,
failed not to demand an explanation after Miss
Arnold was gone. <HI>I</HI> affected mystery at first; but
after much pressing was at last <HI>prevailed,</HI> on to tell him,
that Cecilia had written her sister word that she was
addressed by a gentleman of whom she spoke very hand∣somely,
and who had made himself very acceptable to
lady Sarah Bidulph; but that till her mama was pro∣perly
apprized of it, either by her ladyship or Sir
George, she desired the affair might not be mentioned
at all. Falkland asked the name of this lover; I told
him, that either Cecilia, had not named him, or if she
had, Dolly had not thought proper to trust me with
it; and I begg'd of him never to speak of the thing
to Miss Arnold, as it would only serve to make her
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
reproach me with my indiscretion. He looked morti∣fied;
but said I might depend on it he should not give
himself the <HI>trouble</HI> to make enquiries about a subject
in which he was <HI>no way concerned.</HI> Good, said I to
myself. If I be not mistaken, young man, you will
become a lover in good earnest out of pure spite—Call
you not this advancing his amour, Edward?</P>
<P>[Here follows another series of letters between Sir
Edward and Miss Audley, which, for the same rea∣sons
before offered, are omitted, as they contain no∣thing
more than reciprocal accounts of the progress
of their schemes. Sir Edward mentions in several of
them that he had hopes of succeeding with Cecilia, as
lady Sarah not only admitted but encouraged his visits.
Miss Audley informs her brother that her young friend,
without knowing it, was every day more and more in
love, and she thought that Falkland himself was be∣come
more tender. The following letter the Editor
thinks the only one of this number materially ne∣cessary

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Nov. 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IO, Io, triumphe! Oh, Edward, I wish thy vows
and Cecilia's were reciprocated with the same so∣lemnity,
as those of Falkland and Miss Arnold were
last night. I knew it would, I knew it <HI>must</HI> come to
that; and the lovers, without absolutely being married,
are hampered in the very ties we wished them.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold came to us yesterday about five
o'clock; she had got leave to go with my mama and
me to an assembly, and consequently was to lie at
our house that night, for Mrs. Arnold has indulged
her in greater liberties than usual on account of
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
her sister's absence. My mama (as was preconcerted)
had gone out immediately after dinner <HI>She was sent for
in a violent hurry to a lady, a particular friend of her's
who was in labour; there was no refusing such a sum∣mons;
but she would, if possible, return time enough to
go with us to the assembly.</HI> Falkland was with us by
appointment, and was to have attended us thither.</P>
<P>Dolly was dressed with the utmost elegance, and
looked like an angel; but I saw by her informed coun∣tenance
the minute she entered the room that something
disturbed her. I made my mama's excuses to her,
telling her, if she could not disengage herself time
enough from her friend, that I would, if Miss Arnold
chose it, endeavour to get some other married lady to
go with us. Suppose, said Falkland, we were to
change the scheme of this evening's entertainments, and
instead of going to the stupid assembly, pass the even∣ing
where we are? With all my heart, answered I;
And mine, cried Miss Arnold, for I do not find myself at
present much disposed for the amusements of such a place.</P>
<P>Falkland now approached her, and sitting down by
her, took her hand respectfully; Something has dis∣concerted
you, my dear Miss Arnold, said he, I have
seen it in your looks ever since you came in; <HI>tell</HI>
me?—What's the matter?—There are certain persua∣sive
tones (of which Falkland is a perfect master) that
are not to be resisted; he can, when he pleases, assume
a sweet plaintiveness in his voice, that I have often
considered as a dangerous advantage. Dolly, I believe,
felt the force of it in that instant. She withdrew her
hand gently from his, and, not daring to confess the
true cause of her uneasiness; she replied, I am the
most unfit person in the world for a life of hurry; you
cannot imagine how much my spirits have been fluttered
to-day, to think of what a scene of tumult and dissi∣pation
I am going to plunge into at my uncle Bidulph's,
for lady Sarah is never happy but in a crowd. You do
not as yet think of going to London? cried Falkland.
I apprehended Sir George purposed not to return till
after Christmass. He has changed his mind, answered
Dolly, or rather lady Sarah has changed it for him; for
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
they purpose setting out together from Bath next Sun∣day,
and the following week my uncle comes himself
to fetch me to town. I believe, added she, Sir George
has a husband in his thoughts for my sister, for he in∣forms
my mama that my lord V—is now at Bath.
He bestows great encomiums on him, and says that lady
V—and he have already given him to Cecilia, with
whom my lord is quite charmed; and this I suppose
was the lover that Cecilia hinted at.</P>
<P>I saw the blood mount in Falkland's cheeks; he
seemed mortified,—but whether at the thoughts of
Cecilia's marriage, or at those of losing his conquest
by Dolly's removing to London, I can't say; for I
know not whether love or vanity was in that moment
most predominant. They were both silent for a little
while; Falkland's eyes were fixed on Miss Arnold,
her's were bent to the ground: and I perceived it was
with difficulty she restrained her tears. He saw it too;
this was the time to speak. You are going, madam,
said he, to receive the homage of all the world; this
obscure corner will be no longer in your thoughts, and
you will forget perhaps even the <HI>friendship</HI> with which
you have honoured me.—No!—was all Dolly
could reply; she dared not to trust the steadiness of
her voice with any more; even this poor little mono∣syllable,
though uttered emphatically, was not raised
above her breath. Again they were both silent, and I
waited with that kind of expectation, I believe, in my
face that tame fowls appear to have when they expect
a shower. What would I then have given for a de∣cent
pretence to have left the room! The juncture
seemed so critical, if let slip perhaps it was irrecover∣able.
In short, I was just going to rise and leave them
without any pretence at all, when a loud rap at the
door offered me a very fair one; up I bounced from
my chair, and flew out of the parlour to order myself
to be denied, as I told them, having forgot to use this
precaution before; but one of the servants, happening
to be in the hall, had already opened the door, and
in rustled Miss Leatham. I led her into the little
drawing room, called for lights, and we both sat
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
down. Right glad was I of her company, insipid a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it is, as it afforded me a very good excuse for ab∣senting
myself a while from the two friends, who,
I had reason to believe, would in that interval dis∣cover
the fallacy of their Platonic system.</P>
<P>Miss Leatham was going to the assembly; but as
she is one of those who affects coming in late to a pub∣lic
place, she chose to oblige me with her company
for half an hour before she went. Having exhausted
her whole stock of ideas, she asked me (observing I
was dressed out) whether I did not mean to go to the
assembly? I told her it had been my intention, but
that a young lady who was to have gone with me, and
who was then in the house, having been taken ill had
prevented my design. This was a sufficient hint, and
she went away directly.</P>
<P>I returned to the parlour, and was very soon con∣vinced
that Falkland had not made a foolish use of his
time. Dolly had but just time to withdraw her hand
from his lips, as I entered the room. You and I, Ed∣ward,
who can read faces, would have wanted no o∣ther
information of what had passed, than what we
could have learnt from both of theirs. On his, sat an
air of triumph, mingled with pleasure and gratitude:
On her's complacency and redoubled tenderness, chas∣tened
by fear. He now assumed the conversation with
the utmost freedom, and rattled away on the subject
of my visiter (whom he knows very well) with that
kind of ease which a person discovers, who having
happily dispatched some important concern that hung
on their mind, descends into the common affairs of
life with a disposition to be pleased with every thing.
Dolly, on the other hand, was silent, and even ap∣peared
embarrassed; yet through this I could disco∣ver
an inward satisfaction that proved to me her <HI>heart</HI>
was more at ease than before. <HI>She</HI> seemed <HI>more</HI> re∣served
than usual; Falkland, much <HI>less.</HI> He more
than once ventured to take her hand; she constantly
withdrew it, yet her looks reprimanded not the free∣dom.
Lord, how prettily foolish was all this! I
would have given six-pence for a lover myself; and
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
had Cecilia and you been present, all the world to
nothing she would have been your own; for, as I
told you before, Edward, we girls hate to be like
cyphers</P>
<P>My mama returned to supper (she could not possi∣bly
get away from her friend sooner.) We were all in∣finitely
good humoured, but rather sillyish; for every
one was full of themselves, though each asked questi∣ons
of the other, about which they did not care a
pinch of snuff to be informed. Falkland took his
leave at a very decent hour, and Miss Arnold and
I retired to my chamber, for she chose to sleep with
me. When we were alone, Well, my dear? said
I. Oh, Sophy, (both her hands held up) what have
I done? <HI>What</HI> have you done, Dolly? no harm, I
am sure.—I have given myself away! an irrevoca∣ble
vow has passed my lips, never to be the wife
of any man but Falkland! Bravo! said I. Good
God, cried she, clasping her hands together, are
you not startled at the phrenzy of this action? <HI>I</HI>
am frighted when I look back; how little ought we
to be trusted with ourselves? Oh, Miss Audley, you
left me in a fatal minute. Had I escaped to-night,
I was determined never to have given Mr. Falk∣land
another opportunity, for <HI>till</HI> to night he never
explained himself. And what said he to-night, Miss
Arnold? for hitherto, as far as I understand, (what∣ever
his secret wishes might have been) he seemed not
to <HI>claim</HI> more than friendship and esteem from you.
Sophy, said she, whilst you live never contract a
friendship with a <HI>man;</HI> 'twas that deceitful word
which has ensnared me, and led me at last to burst
the bonds of filial duty, of confidence, of gratitude
to the best of mothers I—Cecilia too, what
will <HI>she</HI> say to find her sister such a cast-away? A
flood of tears now burst from her eyes. Have you
not, my dear, said I, received the vows of Falkland
in return? Oh yes, answered she, yet I know not
how it came to pass. My mind was all a chaos, I
forgot every thing, I existed but to him; and he ob∣tained
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
my promise before I was sensible that he had
demanded it. The moment you left the room, con∣scious
of my own weakness and terrified at my situa∣tion,
I burst into tears; Falkland wept at the same
time. I could not bear this; I started up from my
chair, and would have ran out. I believe I should
have flown to you, my eyes all red as they were;
but he catched me by the hand,—You are go∣ing,
my dear Miss Arnold, said he, you are going to
be the idol of a thousand hearts, and I shall be for∣gotten.
Impossible, I cried; Oh, Falkland! you
know too well that that is impossible!—Say then,
said he, that I shall never lose the place that I have
now the happiness to possess in your heart.—Sinking
almost into the earth with confusion, I scarcely arti∣culated
the word, Never! Will you then be mine?
he demanded.—I know not what answer I return∣ed;
an assent no doubt it was, for he instantly (for
the first time) took the liberty of saluting me, and
then in the strongest expressions swore he would live
only for me—Awaked as it were from a dream,
I cried out, What have I said? What has made me
the happiest of men, he replied, you have promised
to be mine only. See, Sophy, continued she, into
what an irretrievable error a few short minutes may
betray us! He talked afterwards of a private marri∣age,
hopeless as he is of getting my friends consent;
but I conjured him not to speak of that.—Why,
what do you mean to do, my dear? interrupted I:
surely you purpose to fulfil your engagements to Falk∣land?
Doubtless, said she, I wed him or my grave;
yet how is it possible for me all at once to determine
on a step so rash, and but a few hours ago, so unfore∣seen?
We are both very young, we may wait a
while—Time, with the interposition of a few com∣passionate
friends, may do something in our favour.
I know my uncle has ambitious views both for my
sister and me; but perhaps he may be satisfied with
disposing of Cecilia to a titled husband, and leave me
free to make an humbler choice. If my sister should
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
marry my lord V—I stopped her short here,
thinking it very expedient to throw in a seasonable
word for you; A propos, Dolly, said I, you imagine
that the lord V—was the nameless lover whom
Cecilia hinted at in a former letter to you; but I am
of a quite different opinion, and rather suspect 'tis
my mad-cap of a brother. Though I affected to say
this very jocosely, Miss Arnold seemed surprized, and
asked me why I thought so; Because, said I, I have
had a letter from him very lately, wherein he tells me
he has been at Bath for some time; but changes me
not to let my mama know it, as she would be very
angry with him for absenting himself from my uncle
Howel. Well? said Miss Arnold. Well, said I,
and he says, that in order to drive you from his
thoughts, and be revenged of you at the same time,
he makes love to your sister. This is so like Sir Ed∣ward!
continued I, laughing; but I can tell you, he
adds that Cecilia receives him kindly, and that he is
a great favourite of lady Sarah's; and really your
sister's keeping his secret, which I suppose he begg'd
of her to do, <HI>does</HI> carry with it an air of kindness.
'Tis very true, said Miss Arnold, smiling, and I am
very glad to find that the slight wound he received
from me is so soon healed. My brother, said I, is not
so romantic as to love on without the hopes of a return;
but if Cecilia be disposed to make him one, I insist on
it, Dolly, that you do not endeavour to divert her in∣clinations
from him, by telling her what has passed,
with regard to yourself. Ah, Miss Audley! replied
she, I have <HI>now</HI> no right to prescribe to my sister; I
am too much humbled in my own eyes, to presume to
be a monitor. There was something indignant in her
manner, like one who felt themselves under the mor¦tifying
necessity of conforming (however repugnant to
their own sentiments) to the will of those in whose
power they have put themselves. This, Edward, is
not the least of those evils to which we poor women
subject ourselves, when we deviate a little from the
very narrow and thorny paths of rectitude; but let Miss
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
Arnold consider it thus if she will, it makes for our
purpose; and one sometimes obtains from fear, what
even friendship would deny, and gratitude itself would
refuse. If Sir Edward, said I, is so happy as to suc∣ceed
with Cecilia, it will pave the way for Falkland.
The disparity between <HI>them</HI> is not so great as between
your lover, and lord V—, and your choice would
not throw you at such a distance from your sister; that
single consideration should induce you to countenance
my brother's pretensions; besides, the strict friendship
between them will enable you to hear from, and per∣haps
oftner to see Falkland than you could otherwise
expect.—No, Sophy, said she, my sister shall never
have <HI>my</HI> example as an excuse for disobedience. If
Sir Edward wins her heart, I shall not interpose be∣tween
them, (though I do not think 'tis likely he
should ever obtain the suffrage of my family) but
Cecilia shall not have the frailty of her elder sister to
plead in her excuse for an imprudent choice; there∣fore
be assured I shall conceal my engagements with
Mr. Falkland as carefully from her, as I would from
the rest of my friends, till the most favourable oppor∣tunity
shall offer of divulging them. What a perverse
determination is this, Edward! it has unhinged the
principal movement in our machine; yet my hope is,
that Dolly will not be able to keep her resolution.</P>
<P>But if after all the pains with which I have been la∣bouring
for your interests, my lord V—should step
in and snatch away the reward of our toil! The thought
is not to be borne; <HI>Have I for Banquo's Issue,</HI> &amp;c. Oh,
Edward, it rests upon the single point of a young girl's
liking a sprightly young fellow of twenty-three, bet∣ter
than an exceedingly grave man (the very reverse of
her own temper) with the comfortable addition of, I
believe ten years more added to his age. That's
something yet;—but I like not his pretensions, and
wish he had staid in Germany.</P>
<P>My mama proposes going to London in about a
fortnight. I suppose you will soon join us there, and
as you stand so well with lady Sarah, the way is open
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
to you, at least as far as access to Cecilia will carry
you. When Falkland comes to town, I take it for
granted, you will fix him at our house. Our acquaint∣ance
(my mama's and mine I mean) is but slight with
lady Sarah Bidulph, yet we mean to cultivate it; the
two girls, of course, will be often with us. Cecilia
must then necessarily discover (spight of her sister) how
matters stand between her and Falkland. What then
will become of Dolly's wise precautions? And who
knows but the path may look so flowery to the young∣er,
as may tempt her steps to wander as far as we are
disposed to lead her?—Adieu, my dear Edward;
what a plotter am I become for thy service!</P>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>Nov 8th</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AND so Miss Arnold has given herself to Falk∣land;
an irrevocable vow has passed her lips,
is't not so? Oh, those ruby lips! Well, let him take
her; and now to other business, for I am in a horrid
ill humour. The Bidulphs set off this morning for
London, and have taken my little girl with them. I
have lost since I came to this scurvy place—more
than I'll tell you; for though none of the sober
ones knew of my playing, I fell in with a set here
who used to meet every night in a private room, and,
curse them, they have stripped me. Another thou∣sand
deep since I left Oxford. But this is not the
worst, the rival I have got is a devilish formidable one.
That same lord V—, who came down hither to pay
his duty (as the old beldames call it) to his mother,
dares to eye my Cecilia; but, thank heaven, she seems
utterly regardless of him; yet is he one of those plau∣sible
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
curs, that all your mothers, and aunts, and co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sins
would be for hampering directly in lawful wed∣lock
with any young thing of whom they had to dis∣pose.
Besides; he is an earl, Sophy, and I being but
a simple baronet, he consequently mounts three steps
higher on the ladder of lady Sarah's good graces.
Sir George (with a vengeance to him!) invited his vi∣sits
in town. Oh, to be sure his lordship does not
<HI>mean</HI> to drop the acquaintance.—Now could I
drink hot blood! and utter such imprecations on
them all! I tell you Sophy, I am desperate, and if a
change is not wrought and that suddenly in my for∣tune,
I know not to what extremities I may be driven,
If I find this interloper is likely to snatch away the
fruits of our long laboured process, by my soul, I'll snap
up Cecilia at the first short turn I meet her, and leave i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to her own good-nature, and Mrs Arnold's <HI>christia∣nity</HI>
to work out my pardon. Falkland, at the same
time, may carry off <HI>his</HI> legal prize. What a glorious
triumph would this be over the insolent blood of the
Bidulphs! I shall leave Bath directly, and make
straight to London, without returning to Oxford, as
I at first proposed.</P>
<P>[Here, in the order of the manuscript, follow some
letters which passed between Mr. Falkland and Miss
Arnold after the latter had gone to London, those to
her being directed under cover to Miss Audley; but
as these contain nothing more than mutual expressions
of affection, they are omitted. Miss Arnold says in
one of them, “The Audley family are our constant
visitors, which is the chief pleasure of my life; for
Sophy and I talk whole hours of you. Sir Edward
pretends to be an admirer of my sister, but she likes
him not; and indeed he is so volatile there is no
knowing whether he is in jest or earnest.”]</P>

<P>“ONE of the best of girls in the world,” you
say I am. My dear mama, those are the
kind words with which your last letter was closed.
I wish I may continue to deserve that character,
for indeed I am so flattered and so caressed that
I am in great danger of being spoiled. I am the
darling of lady Sarah; and only my uncle Bidulph is
fonder of my sister than he is of me, my vanity would
carry me away for want of a little ballast.</P>
<P>I have now no less than <HI>four</HI> lovers. Dolly is so
exceedingly retired (for she hates company) that she
has not one, at least not one who has ventured to
declare himself. Lady Sarah calls her a prude, and
says she freezes the men with her cold looks. My
uncle swears she is handsomer than I am, to which
opinion I very readily subscribe.—Well, but about
these four lovers—besides the three I mentioned to
you before, lord V—'s name now graces my list. He
is come to town, has been several times to visit us,
and has said such fine things to me! Dear mama, you
can't imagine what a fool they make of me. My
spirits hurry me away, and I know you love my idle
prattle, yet I am disposed to be very grave at this
minute, for I suspect there are serious designs going
forward. My three first lovers I laughed at, but my
fourth, I am afraid, will vex me. Both Sir George
and lady Sarah speak of him as of a desirable alli∣ance;
but remember I tell you, mama, I do not like
lord V—, and I am sure you will never constrain
your own poor Cecilia. My sister approves mightily
of him. I think he would make an excellent husband
for her, for she is as sober as he, and she would have
no objection to his being twelve or fourteen years
older than herself.—She looks over my shoulder, and
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
says, “No indeed, I should not.”—Well, then take
him, Dolly, for I can spare him. Here, my dear ma∣ma,
let us both subscribe our names with the ten∣derest
affection and duty. I have written the letter,
Miss Arnold, and therefore my name shall be signed
first.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Miss CECILIA ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Dec. 22d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CONTINUE, my dear, continue to cherish
those charming spirits that make you so agree∣able
to all your friends, and which were the support
of my life during my melancholy visit at Burnly. But
beware, Cecilia, of letting them run away with you.
I am not afraid of your vanity; your good sense will
be a sufficient counterbalance to that, though your uncle
were even as partial to you as he is to your sister. I
am not therefore afraid of your vanity, I say, but I
am afraid of your caprice; for is there not something
of that, child, in a resolution so suddenly formed not
to like lord V—? for so I must construe your words;
and sure I am 'tis impossible you can have any <HI>rational</HI>
objection to him.</P>
<P>I remember him a boy when he first went into the
army. He was then remarkably handsome, and time
cannot have wrought such a change in a man not
over thirty,—but that he must still retain a very
agreeable person. And for his character, 'tis such as
must recommend him to every one of understanding
and virtue. I would not constrain you, Cecilia; no,
far be it from your affectionate parent's heart to con∣strain
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
so obedient a child; but I would <HI>advise</HI> you,
my dear, advise you for your good.</P>
<P><HI>Advice</HI> from a mother was always considered by
<HI>me</HI> as a <HI>command:</HI> yet I do not desire you to regard it
in so severe a light. We have been educated dif∣ferently.
You were always treated with the kindest
indulgence, with all reasonable allowances made for
the inadvertence of youth, and the overboiling spirits
which your natural vivacity has given you. I, on
the other hand, though tenderly beloved by my ever
honoured mother, had, nevertheless, my neck early
bowed to obedience; and this it was which con∣strained
me to yield up my nearest wishes, and, as it
were, mould my heart to the will of her to whom I
thought I owed all duty. Perhaps your grand-mama
exacted too much of me; for at the time Mr. Arnold
was proposed to me as a husband, she knew I enter∣tained
more than a bare inclination for another object;
but this is not your case, Cecilia; your young heart
has not, it cannot have had the opportunity of en∣gaging
itself.</P>
<P>Why then reject an offer so honourable, so advan∣tageous,
so desirable in the eyes of all your friends?
I am the more serious on this occasion, my dear, be∣cause
I have very lately received a letter from lady
V—herself on the same subject. She tells me her
son was (to use her own words) smitten by you the
moment he saw you; the account he received of your
fortune and your education, probably, did not damp
his growing inclination. Lady V—says in her letter,
“If you will trust to the judgment of a parent not ex∣tremely
partial to lord V—he is a very valuable
young man, and in every respect worthy of being
my dear Mrs. Arnold's son.” These were her affec∣tionate
expressions; and she added, “How delighted
should I be to call you sister!” See then, my love,
what a prospect is opened before you of making yourself,
of making your whole family happy! Yet <HI>remember,</HI>
Cecilia, (I retort your own words back on you) I do
not constrain you. I repeat it once more, I never will;
though I should be sorry my daughter could not give
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
a more substantial reason than mere whim, for refu∣sing
a man so unobjectionable as lord V—. Tell my
dear Dolly, I do not think she has the less merit for
not having so many <HI>admirers</HI> as her little lively sister.
I am sure she has as many <HI>lovers,</HI> and perhaps Cecilia
ought to be more mortified than proud, that she has
so many <HI>declared</HI> ones.</P>
<P>My brother and lady Sarah have my warmest wishes.
Mr. Price kisses both your hands, and my Orlando,
who was here when I received your last letter, and to
whom I read it, says he hopes soon, in person, to do
the same. Receive both of you, my dear children,
the tenderest love, as well ardent prayers for your
happiness poured from the heart of your affectionate,

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>December 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW I curse my stars for what is past! how
curse my own folly, my own vanity, my own
childish pity, and weak resentment! but above all,
how I curse you! yes, <HI>you,</HI> whose blind officious
meddling friendship combined with them all to undo
me. Did I not tell you in the beginning I loved Ce∣cilia,
that I adored her, and that I felt nothing for
her sister beyond the warmth of friendship? Why did
you awaken my compassion, by discovering to me
that she loved me? Why did you encourage me to
feed a flame that I never thought of kindling, that I
never wished, that I never meant to return? This,
this is what I accuse you of; but the charge I have
against myself is still more flagrant. I acknowledge
myself coxcomb enough to have been pleased with the
conquest of a heart on which I set not the least value;
I acknowledge myself fool enough to have in some
moments mistaken mere compassion for love; and I
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
own myself tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or enough to have suffered the simple
effusions of gratitude to pass upon an innocent crea∣ture
for the genuine expressions of passion. My pride
urged me on against inclination, and I felt a secret
pleasure at the thoughts of humbling Sir George
Bidulph, by triumphing in the affections of her whom
he calls the <HI>boast</HI> of his family. See here the source
of all my actions, despicable sot that I was, thus to
let such paltry passions wind me about like a machine!
That fatal letter, written by the arrogant and ill-bo∣ding
pen of Bidulph, put the finishing hand to my
destruction. <HI>He had already given my Cecilia to lord
V</HI>—, he said. Cecilia herself tells her sister she had a
lover; cruel and thoughtless as she was, why did she
not then say that she hated him? What a load of remorse
would that declaration have spared me! I thought
<HI>her</HI> irretrievably lost to <HI>me;</HI> her sister's tenderness af∣fected
me; jealousy and indignation, mingling with
gratitude and pity, lit up a momentary fire in my
heart. I offered vows to Miss Arnold, which that
heart, treacherous to its master as well as her, forced
me in the instant to think sincere. I received hers in
return, too, too sincere, I am afraid they are, for
such a villain! For will you not think me one? will
you not even call me one, when I tell you, that the
next day all my indifference for her returned, and I
sound nothing in my heart but rancour against the
happier lord V—?</P>
<P>The letters I have constantly received from her
since, filled with tenderness and faith, reproach me
in every line. How difficult do I find it to frame my
answers! for I am not yet hardened enough in deceit
not to be shocked at professing a love which I do not
feel; for, spight of all my efforts, I find that Cecilia
holds her first place in my heart. I have oftentimes
been half distracted with this thought; but something
occurred yesterday which has made me desperate. I
happened to be with Mrs. Arnold when she received a
letter from Cecilia; wherein she tells her mother posi∣tively
that she <HI>cannot like lord V</HI>—. How delighted
was I with this declaration, till I recollected my own
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
fatal engagements! But this is not all; she mentioned
other lovers. I demanded of Mrs. Arnold who they
were. She named, as one of them, Sir <HI>Edward
Audley.</HI> Sir Edward Audley the lover of Cecilia!
the baby-face, whose beauty was not to be compared
to that of her sister! I could stab you for daring to
think of her; and nothing saves you from my venge∣ance,
but Cecilia's indifference for you.</P>
<P>I am half mad, Sir Edward; so take nothing ill
that I say. I dread the sight of Miss Arnold; but I
a thousand times more dread the invincible Cecilia,
whose heart, perhaps, is still at liberty. What a
storm has this thought raised in my bosom! I shall
come to town in a few days, and woe be to him I
find a successful rival! for I tell you, I would rather
see Cecilia dead than in the arms of another.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>December 23d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HA, ha, ha, ha, poor Falkland! And so it is vi∣sited
with compunction and remorse! All the
bugbears that old Price used to conjure up, in order
to frighten you in the nursery, have followed you, I
find, to the university. Oh, fy, fy, Orlando! I am
quite ashamed of you. I thought I had left you pret∣ty
well fortified against these sort of sopperies when I
went to Wales; but I see there is no trusting such a
half-fledged sinner to himself; for no sooner is my
back turned, than whip you take your conscience
out from between the leaves of your Bible, where
you keep it like your band, for fear of being rump∣led,
and <HI>like</HI> that, after a game of romps, you clap it
on again, to visit your grave acquaintance; but why
put it on to me, boy, who like you so much better
dishabille? I do think thou art the most whimsical
fellow that ever I met with in my life; the dog in
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
the manger was thy prototype. Why what a snarling
our art thou, to begrudge lord V—and me a little
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at what thou canst not touch thyself? But your
great consolation is, that this dainty morsel is out of
the reach of us both; for, by her own confession, she
does not care a farthing for either of us. I do firmly
believe it, Falkland; and so things are just as they
were before we set out: for as for your vows, and
your gratitude, and your villainy, and your sensibili∣ty,
and your perfidy, and your repentance, 'tis all
such a bead-roll of Arnoldian nonsense, that I blush
to hear a fellow of your spirit talk thus like a 'pren∣tice-boy
making his last speech at Tyburn, and bid∣ding
the good people beware of evil company, which
had caused his downfal, and brought him unto that
shameful end. You accuse <HI>me</HI> first and then yourself;
exactly the malefactor's cant. But pray, my penitent
youth, what have either of us done to deserve con∣demnation?
Thus the affair stands between us; I
find out by chance that a fine girl is in love with you
(by the way I liked her myself, and would have given
a limb to have been in your place;) but jealousy and
rivalship giving way to friendship, I acquaint you
with your good fortune, and advise you, as I would
have done my own brother, to make the most of it.
Was there any harm in this; pray? You tell me, you
love the sister of the lady. I ask you, did you ever
receive any encouragement from her? ever make any
addresses to her? or, in short, have you any hopes
of obtaining her? No, no, no, was the answer to
these three questions. I bid you quit the shadow,
and pursue the substance. Was not that the advice
of a friend? yet this it is for which I am to be cursed
by bell, book, and candle!</P>
<P>As for your own part, what has passed between
you and Miss Arnold, yon know best. If matters
have been brought to a conclusion, why I have no
more to say; but if, on the contrary, the nymph is
in statu quo, and you make all this fuss of self-con∣demnation
about a few silly oaths, and lover's pro∣testations,
you are even below pity, and fit for no∣thing
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
but to scribble miserable ballads, “shewing
how a young maiden's ghost came and tore out the
eyes of her false sweetheart.” Why, thou filly gen∣tleman,
dost let a vow stick in thy throat? What the
plague <HI>is</HI> a vow? for hang me if I know. I know
what it is to swear roundly, in order to make a wo∣man
believe that I shall love <HI>her,</HI> and <HI>only</HI> her, as
long as I live; and I have made many a damsel (by way
of carrying on the farce) swear as many to me in re∣turn;
but it never once entered into my imagination
that she expected I should <HI>keep</HI> those oaths, no more
than I expected she should keep hers, longer than we
liked each other. If these be what you call <HI>vows,</HI> I
have made and broke as many of them as most pri∣vate
gentlemen in England; but I don't remember
that ever even my slumbers were haunted by the in∣jured
nymphs.—Ay, but the case is different: <HI>My</HI>
nymph is immaculate! Diana herself was but a flirt
to her. I make this answer for <HI>you,</HI> Falkland, be∣cause
I take it for granted your courage never carried
you farther than the back of her white hand. If that
be so, then pray what is she the worse for your
<HI>vows?</HI> You squandered away a little breath on her,
and got nothing but breath in return. Oh, but to
break one's promise! one's oaths! Suckling, who
ever thought that an oath made to a woman was
binding? the creatures themselves don't expect it. Is
not the most solemn of all oaths, the matrimonial
oath, violated every day? Is the husband thought
the worse for infidelities to his wife? and would not
the wife be laughed at who complained of them?
I am amazed that you, who judge so well in other
things, still retain some very false notions of honour.
I flattered myself that I had taught you pretty well
how to distinguish; but I see how difficult it is total∣ly
to eraze early wrong impressions.</P>
<P>As for Sir Edward Audley's being the lover of
Cecilia (which you mark with a point of admiration
as long as the Monument) what is there so very ex∣traordinary
in it? Sir Edward Audley is the lover of
every pretty woman he sees. 'Tis true, I liked her
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
sister better; but finding you had stepped into her
heart before me, I gave up the thoughts of her;
and supposing your <HI>interest</HI> might fix you where you
were, I looked upon Cecilia as a right of commonage,
and that I was free to nibble on the borders, without
encroaching on any body's ground; but I'll tell you
fairly, I have not now any prospect of success. I
say not this, Falkland, to deprecate your threatened
vengeance. Had I hopes of winning the fair, I would
use thee and thy vengeance for my sport, yea, for my
laughter. But the truth is, I want you to join me
in a noble enterprize I have conceived, no less than
the carrying off, by force or stratagem, those two
mischievous beauties; and when we have them in
our power, you may take your choice of them; for I
am humble enough to be content with which ever of
them shall fall to my lot.</P>
<P>This lord V—is the mignion of the odious Bi∣dulph
pair, and all their adherents; and notwith∣standing
Cecilia likes him not, she may be borne down
by persuasions to accept him. Think of her being
lady V—, lost to your hopes for ever! and her
poor sister either condemned to virginity, or thrown
away upon a fellow who takes her for mere pity. In
this case, we must <HI>all</HI> be discontented; Cecilia must
be discontented in being married to a man she does
not like; my lord V—, who sets up to have what
the ladies call delicacy, to be sure must be discon∣tented,
without the heart of his wife. These, you
see, is one couple miserable. It will be the same with
regard to you and Miss Arnold. <HI>You</HI> will sigh for
Cecilia in the arms of her sister; and she, poor ten∣der
soul, will break her heart, at finding she is not
beloved by her husband; so there is another couple
for you unhappy. And for myself, I shall be ready
to knock my brains out at my own disappointment.
Now in the other way, at least <HI>half</HI> the mischief will
be saved. The possession of Cecilia makes <HI>you</HI> as
happy as a god. I shall be sufficiently contented, for
a mortal, with her sister; and I'll be sacrificed, if
both the girls, in time, won't grow very fond of us;
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
or, at worst, if they should be perverse enough to
continue indifferent, the indifference would be of the
best side; for the poor dears, tramelled as they have
always been with the notions of duty, would never
once take it into their heads that there were any
consolatory wanderings beyond the matrimonial
pale.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have made it appear as clear as
the sun, that no one would suffer materially but lord
V—; for which, I fancy, neither you nor I should
have very deep regrets. But the glory of our tri∣umph
would be in the discomfiture of the Bidulphs;
when if, like a brace of towering falcons, we could
souce upon our prey, and bear away, like trembling
doves, the two young Arnolds in our strong pounces!
The very idea lifts me above the clouds! Dost not
thou, Falkland, kindle at the thought? Hasten to town
then, thou dreamer, and do not fit sighing and moping
in the chimney-corner, and raving of what you call
the <HI>past.</HI> What is the past but an idle thodomon∣tade,
never to be thought of more? Think of the
present, think of what's to come, think of Cecilia,
think of your friend, and that one bold stroke makes
us both happy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir GEORGE BIDULPH to Mrs. ARNOLD.
Dear Sister,
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Dec. 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE many avocations in which I am perpetual∣ly
engaged, prevent me from being so punctual
a correspondent as I otherwise should be. Indeed I
can scarce prevail upon myself to take up a pen, but
upon important occasions, such as I consider this on
which I am going to write.</P>
<P>Your daughter Cecilia, I suppose, may have in∣formed
you that my lord V—makes his addresses
to her, under my sanction, which I concluded I might
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
venture to give him, without previously consultiug
you, who, I am sure, cannot possibly have any ob∣jection
to him. I am very willing to allow a young
lady all the indulgence which the levity of youth re∣quires,
and all the homage which beauty exacts; but
this must not be carried too far, and a man of lord
V—'s rank, and unquestionable merit, is not to be
treated on the footing of a Sir Edward Audley. I am
sorry Cecilia, knows so little how to distinguish, and
that she has hitherto paid no more regard to the real
passion of a worthy as well as very amiable man,
than she does to the fluttering pretensions of that very
insignificant boy. Sidney, this is not an offer to be
trifled with; and the very noble proposals which lord
V—makes, are such as may not fall in our way
every day. I should be very unwilling to interpose
parental authority on this occasion; but where a gid∣dy
girl does not know how to chuse for herself, 'tis the
duty of her friends to chuse for her. Cecilia can
have no previous engagements; at least her sister
knows of none in Oxfordshire, and lady Sarah is cer∣tain
she could have contracted none at Bath, as she was
never from under her own eye; and she professes the
utmost indifference for every man with whom she has
become acquainted since she came to town. What is
it then but vanity, and a love of admiration, that can
make her averse to the thoughts of marrying? Lord
V—is past the age of dangling; yet is he so much
in love with this mad-cap, that he admires even her
faults. I would not here be understood to mean that
she has any thing really blameable in her conduct;
on the contrary, I think her an admirably good girl,
and when she comes to be a little more serious, will
mane any man happy who has the good fortune to
please her.</P>
<P>Lord V—had thoughts of going to pay you a
visit; in which design I prevented him, as I imagine
his lordship has a much longer journey to take to
Miss Cecilia's heart. I told him, there was no doubt
of obtaining your consent, if he could win that of
your daughter. I must, therefore, request it of you,
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
Sidney, that you will write to her <HI>strongly</HI> on the
subject. I find she has one subterfuge, to which she
always flies whenever I urge her on this point. My
mama, she cries, would not press me to what I dis∣like.
I am afraid this indulgence of yours may be
productive of consequences as disagreeable in their
effects as the too ready submission of her mama was
upon another occasion.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah is very much yours. Neither of my
nieces know of my writing to you; but I am sure
they both love and honour you.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
Dear Brother,
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Dec. 28th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU did but justice to lord V—'s worth, in
supposing I <HI>could</HI> have no objection to him. I
<HI>have</HI> none; on the contrary, I should look upon his
alliance as an honour both to my daughter and me.
I love his excellent mother, and revere the memory
of his good father, to whom I had obligations never
to be forgotten. I have but little personal knowledge
of my lord himself; but know enough of his charac∣ter
to make me wish to see him united to us by the
closest ties. It is with equal surprize and concern I
hear Cecilia is averse to him. A <HI>reasonable</HI> cause of
dislike she cannot have; I therefore am in hopes that
time and a little perseverance on my lord's side will
overcome her reluctance. I have written to her on
the subject in such a manner as, I believe, you will
approve. The <HI>authority</HI> of a parent I never will ex∣ert;
too dearly have I myself experienced the conse∣quences
of such a proceeding; but as far as remon∣strance,
advice, and admonition goes, I have not been
sparing. I am under a promise to both my children
never to urge their acceptance of a man whom they
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
did not like; but <HI>my</HI> punctilio does not bind <HI>you.</HI>
You are therefore at liberty to use every means (ab∣solute
force excepted) to prevail on Cecilia to receive
as she ought so advantageous an offer. I own I could
have wished that Dolly had been, lord V—'s choice,
as I think her sedate temper would have suited him
better; and I am sure her gentle and complying dispo∣sition
would have yielded, without repugnance, to
the will of her friends; but as we cannot direct the
heart where to make an election, and my. lord V—
has already fixed his, we have nothing more in our
power than to endeavour, by every warrantable me∣thod,
to procure for him such a return as he de∣serves.</P>
<P>I salute lady Sarah with my best regards, and am,
&amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA. B—to Mrs. ARNOLD.
[The letter to which this is an answer is omitted, as
the substance of it may be gathered from the fol∣lowing.]
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Jan. 3d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Know not what to do with this negociation in
which you have employed me, my dear Sidney.
I find Cecilia strangely averse to lord V—, yet I
cannot get from her any satisfactory reasons for her
dislike. Both your daughters were with me on Mon∣day,
by invitation, and I entered heartily into the
subject. Is he not, said I, (speaking of lord V—)
a very handsome man? (the first consideration, you
know, with most girls:) Yes, certainly, the man's
not amiss as to person. A very accomplished man?
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
No doubt of it? he speaks several living languages,
and, for aught I know, may be an excellent scholar
and a rare musician. Extremely well bred, and per∣fectly
good tempered? The man's civil, and I never
saw him angry. The monkey would give her own
flippant answers. Of unexceptionable, morals? She
turned her eyes at me with so arch a look, that I
could scarce refrain from laughing. I know nothing
to the contrary, madam. Has not he a fine estate? I
do not want money, Mrs. B—. Of a considerable
family, and noble rank? I desire not titles either.
What then <HI>do</HI> you desire, Cecilia? Only to please
myself; and she shook her little head so, that all the
powder and the curls in her hair fell about her face,
and I never beheld such a pretty wild figure in my
life. Miss Arnold reproved her; Cecilia, you are
too giddy. Dolly, you are too grave, the other re∣plied.
I have nothing but my spirits to support my
courage; for indeed, my dear Mrs. B—, I am sadly
teized by my uncle about this same lord V—. I
wish he had staid where he was, or that he had
made choice of my sister instead of me; she is the
<HI>very</HI> thing for him. She then flew to my harpsichord,
rattled away a tune on it, then turning round, she
began a minuet, singing to herself, and danced two or
three turns round the room with inimitable spirit and
grace. In short, there is no being angry with this
girl for any thing; for 'tis such a bewitching little
gipsey, that I believe she could, persuade any one to
be of her way of thinking. I made two or three more
efforts to renew the conversation, but could not get
her to be serious. Sir George sent his coach for them
at eight o'clock. When she was going away, You
think me very wild said she; but I have my hours of
sadness. For what, my dear? Oh, you will know
all in time, in a low voice, as she curtsied to take her
leave; and down she flew like a lapwing.</P>
<P>I find I did not know this girl, from what I saw of
her in your presence. Restrained, perhaps, a little
by that circumstance, she gave not such full scope to
her vivacity; yet how charming is that vivacity,
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
when joined to so much innocence and sweetness of
temper as she possesses! I do not wonder that she at∣tracts
more than Dolly, though (in my eye) she is a
more captivating beauty; yet the other is the ignis
fatuus for the men to follow. But now I speak of
Dolly, indeed, my dear, I am afraid that poor young
creature has some secret malady lurking about her,
though she herself is not sensible of it. Her dejection
of spirits seems increased, and her looks considerably
altered for the worse, since I last saw her at Wood∣berry.
She says, the late hours she is obliged to keep
at your, brother's, do not at all agree with her.
There may be something in this; yet I shall give lady
Sarah the same advice, that I once before gave you,
viz. to consult with some physician about her. Mr.
B—and I are to dine with her to-day, and I will
keep this letter open till my return in the evening.
Perhaps I may have something worth adding, as what
I have said above is so little satisfactory.</P>
<P>Thursday, <DATE>Jan. 4th.</DATE></P>
<P>I have indeed something to add, my dear, which,
I am afraid, will not be very pleasing to you, yet
such as it is, you must have it. We dined yesterday
(as I told you we intended) at Sir George's. An in∣tolerable
crowd there was. Lord V—, Lady Audley,
and Miss, were part of the company, and seven or
eight more with whom I had scarce any acquaintance.
After dinner we adjourned to the drawing-room,
where the card-tables were placed, for lady Sarah
said we were a snug little party. We had not yet sat
down to-cards, but were still sipping our tea; every
one had got into separate parties; Cecilia, armed at
all points, sat like a little divinity dealing her shafts
about her; a lover on each hand, lord V—on this,
Sir Edward Audley (who had dropped in after dinner)
on the other; an each of whom she seemed to bestow
an equal share of her attention, her good humour,
and her wit. Lady Sarah with some other ladies
had entered into a dissertation on a new Persian car∣pet,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
which had for the first time been that very day
spread on the floor. My sovereign lord, who had en∣gaged
in a political dispute at dinner, had brought
the argument up stairs with him, and was re-tracing
it to a little auditory of his own. Miss Arnold and
I were sitting together, and Sir. George, playing with
my fan, was standing before us talking to us both.
Such was the disposition of things, which I know
you love to have, as it were, brought before your
eyes, when a loud rap at the door warned us of the
approach of some visitor, Lady Sarah, always, pre∣sent
to herself on those <HI>little</HI> occasions, turned her
eyes mechanically towards the candles to see how they
burnt, then on her two nieces to observe if any
thing in their dress required to be adjusted, and lastly
on herself for the same purpose. Miss Arnold, who
complained of having a cold, was obliged to wear a
cap under her chin, which, as it hid her fine profil,
made her appear rather to disadvantage. As for Ce∣cilia,
I never saw the little hussy look so handsome
in my life, The servant who introduced the visitor
pronounced the name, of Mr. Falkland, and in walked
your son Orlando. All the company who were not
already, standing, rose of course. Lady Sarah just
cast her eyes at him, and averted them immediately
with a look as one should say, Ah, is it nobody, but
<HI>you!</HI> Falkland made his bows with a good grace,
though without being well able to distinguish who
and who were together, and a little abashed, I be∣lieve,
at seeing so large a company. He advanced,
however, towards lady Sarah, Your servant, Sir,
said she, turning immediately (in her forbidding way)
to stir the fire, which by the bye did not want stir∣ring.
Servant, Mr. Falkland, cried Sir George, bow∣ing
low enough; but raising himself again with that
quick and careless motion which a man never uses
but to those with whom he is either very free, or
whom he considers as his inferiors. The servant had
placed a chair for him; Sit down, Mr. Falkland, said
Sir George, in an imperative tone, which implied,
<HI>Young man, don't keep the company standing.</HI> It was
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
rather course in Sir George, it-lessened Falkland, and
made him appear as if he were not worth the atten∣tion
of any one present. He seemed to feel it in this
light, for he coloured extremely; however, as he
is not a stranger to good breeding, he quickly took
his place, every one re-assuming their's, except Ce∣cilia,
who removing from her two admirers, came
and placed herself between her sister and me.</P>
<P>Falkland now discovered several faces that he
knew; he addressed himself severally to lady Aud∣ley,
and her daughter, to me, to the two Miss Ar∣nolds,
and lastly, to Sir Edward Audley. Your two
poor girls, who had reddened with joy at the sight
of him, had their eyes wistfully fixed upon him from
the moment he came in; but not having had an op∣portunity
of speaking till he had paid his compli∣ments
round, seemed impatient for him to take notice
of them.</P>
<P>The conversation, which he had interrupted,
now appeared to flag altogether, every one seemed
as if retired into themselves, and poor Orlando look∣ed
embarrassed. Sir George humm'd a tune, When
did you come from Oxford, Mr. Falkland? This
morning, Sir George. You left my sister well, I
hope. Cards, cards, cried lady Sarah; and up
bounced the women with that alacrity which girls do
at the scrape of a siddle for a country-dance. I
beckoned Falkland over to me, whilst lady Sarah
was adjusting the manoeuvre of her tables. He
came to me, and standing before me in a bowing
posture, each of the girls in the same instant pre∣sented
him her hand; he took one in each of his,
affectionately enquiring after their health. Miss Ar∣nold
asked many tender questions about you. Ce∣cilia
put forty to him in a breath, and without wait∣ing
for an answer to the first, proceeded to another.
I found that Falkland, though he seemed not a wel∣come
guest at your brothers, was not an unex∣pected
one; for your daughters said they thought he
would have been in town as yesterday, you having
said to that effect in your last letter.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116"/>
Lady Sarah always makes her nieces play, and she
now summoned them and me to our several parties.
The two sisters were partners, lord V—was mine,
we were all at the same table. Falkland leaned over
the back of my chair: lady Sarah had slightly asked
him if he chose to play; but he declined it. I could
observe that lord V—, as he sate opposite to him,
examined him with a most inquisitive eye; no doubt
he remembers his poor father well. I think I have
heard you say they were related, but this is not a
relationship that will be acknowledged. The suit
commenced by the heirs of that unhappy gentleman,
made the proofs of this poor youth's illegitimacy too
notorious; and I have even heard lady Sarah say, that she
thought it would be prudent in the young man not to
assume the name of a family who would not own him.
You can't imagine, my dear Sidney, how mortified I
felt myself on account of his situation. I wish I
could stop here, but you had better receive the
account of what followed from, me, than perhaps an
aggravated relation from your brother.</P>
<P>I thought Dolly seemed not at all well. She com∣plained
her cold was heavy on her, her colour went
and came several times, and I was afraid she would
have fainted. The room, she said, was too warm;
You had better step out, my dear, said I, the air will
relieve you; give Mr. Falkland your cards. She did
so, and Falkland took her place. Miss Audley, who
was only a looker-on, followed her out of the room.
Lady Audley, having finished her rubber, now got
up; she said she was engaged just to <HI>shew</HI> herself at
Mrs. L—'s assembly; she summoned her daughter to
attend her, and both went away. Yon must know,
this Mrs. L—is the great rival of lady Sarah; they
contrive to have their nights, as they call them, pre∣cisely
at the same time, and their great delight is to
draw away the company from each other. Three or
four more of the ladies were under the same <HI>absolute</HI>
necessity with lady Audley, and lady Sarah had the
mortification to see herself deserted by almost all her
female visitors; but she had the comfort to reflect
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
that this was not one of <HI>her</HI> nights. The company
now seemed broke up, excepting our table, which
still held together, and lady Sarah looked very much
out of humour. The men began to faunter about the
room, as if they did not know what to do with them∣selves;
when my Mr. B—, who dearly loves a game
of whist, proposed that they should make a party
amongst themselves. Then we will leave you toge∣ther,
said lady Sarah, as soon as Mrs. B—is out.
We had done our game presently after, and Mr. B—
obliging all the gentlemen to cut in, fortune allotted
lord V—to him for a partner; Sir Edward Audley
and Mr. Falkland were together, all four at the same
table. Lady Sarah whispered Mr. B—, “You sup
with me to-night.” With all <HI>my</HI> heart, said Mr.
B—; “And you, my lord,” in a whisper to lord V—.
Thank your ladyship; but I am engaged, answered
lord V—. We then left them, lady Sarah, Cecilia,
and I, retiring to Miss Arnold's chamber to enquire
how she did. I have been minute about trifles; but
trifling as these preliminaries are, they led to very
serious consequences.</P>
<P>We found Dolly a little feverish, and we made
her undress and go into bed. Indeed, Sidney, I am
afraid this irregular life will not do with her tender
constitution; yet be not alarmed, my dear, she is now
much better. I called, on her this morning, she was
up, and her complaint, she said, quite removed. We
sat chatting by her till we were told supper was on
table; we went down to the parlour, and found none
there but Sir George and Mr. B—, all the other gen∣tlemen
were gone. I observed Sir George looked
extremely ruffled. I am sorry lord V—could not
stay to sup with us, said lady Sarah. I would have
asked Sir Edward, but I could not get to speak to
him without Mr. Falkland's hearing me, and I did
not think it necessary to invite <HI>him.</HI> I am very glad
you did <HI>not</HI> ask Sir Edward, said Sir George, in a
gruffer tone than I ever heard him use to lady Sarah.
Lord, why so, Sir George? Because, answered he,
he is an impertinent jackanapes, his friend Falkland
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
is no better, and from this time forward my door
shall be <HI>shut</HI> against them both. Cecilia, added he,
your sister seems very fond of Miss Audley; but to
tell you the truth, I don't think either she or her mo∣ther
very desirable acquaintances, and I should be
much better pleased if you dropped them both.
Lady Sarah is her own mistress; but, I suppose, I
may have influence enough upon you two young
ladies to comply with this. Sir Edward is not a
<HI>favourite</HI> of your's niece, is he? He asked this with
a provokingly ill-natured smile. Not in the least,
Sir, answered Cecilia. Bless me, Sir George, I don't
understand you! What can be the meaning of all
this? cried lady Sarah. Well, well, Sir George,
said Mr. B—, let's have done with it; I think Sir
Edward was drunk this evening. (By the bye, I my∣self
had suspected he was not quite sober.) A plea∣sant
apology, answered your brother. My dear, (to
lady Sarah) I'll tell you the affair another time. The
presence of the servants prevented lady Sarah from ask∣ing
any more questions; but she pouted all supper-time,
and poor Cecilia look'd frightened out of her wits.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, Sir George not re∣assuming
the subject, and Mr. B—warding it off by
other conversation, we took our leave without hear∣ing
any farther mention, made, of it; but the account
I had from Mr. B—, is this.</P>
<P>It seems some little inadvertence had been com∣mitted
by lord. V—during their play, which turned
the game at a very critical juncture, and Falkland
and Sir Edward Audley lost. It was at the very
conclusion of their play, the thing was taken no no∣tice
of at the time, and lord V—went away directly;
but Mr. B—, who loves to fight his battles over
again, in talking with some triumph of his victory,
Sir Edward told him he might thank, the <HI>dexterity</HI> of
his partner for his having won; he said the word
<HI>dexterity,</HI> with an emphasis which implied something
more than mere skill at the game, (of which, to say
the truth, lord V—has very little.) Falkland
was imprudent enough, to join him, and said
lord V—had let a card drop very <HI>oppor∣tunely.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
Sir George immediately took fire, and de∣fended
his lordship [Mr. B—says] with unnecessary
warmth. Sir Edward, jealous, I suppose, of lord
V—, said some tart things of him; and Falkland,
whether to take part with his friend, or nettled per∣haps
at lord V—'s having taken no notice of him,
declared himself of Sir Edward's opinion. Sir George
told them they were a couple of <HI>boys;</HI> and they re∣plied,
they were men enough to maintain what they
had said. Do you choose, gentlemen, that lord V—
should be informed of this? Just as you please, Sir
George, was the answer. Mr. B—says he interposed
here, not thinking Sir Edward quite sober, and tell∣ing
your brother he was convinced that lord V—had
made an unintentional mistake, (which was certainly
the case) that the whole ought to be passed by with∣out
any farther notice. The young men seemed full
of resentment, and Sir George said, Young gentle∣men,
you had better <HI>cool</HI> yourselves; upon which
they snatched up their hats, and went away without
the ceremony of a good-night.</P>
<P>Sir George declared, after they were gone, that
though he did not think it worth while to engage
lord V—in a quarrel with them, yet he would never
let either of them into his house again. Sir Edward,
he added, upon the strength of lady Sarah's indul∣gence,
has had the assurance to flirt with my niece;
but as I would as soon give her to Satan, (that was
his expression) I am very glad of this opportunity of
being rid of him.</P>
<P>Whilst I was with Dolly this morning, Miss Audley
called to enquire how she did; but she was refused
admittance; <HI>both the Miss Arnolds were gone out,</HI>
that was the answer she received at the door. The
poor girls are mortified to the last degree at this
affair, as it not only robs them of an acquaintance
they like, but deprives them of the sight of Falkland
too, for he lives at lady Audley's, and all communi∣cation
is now cut off there.</P>
<P>You cannot think how this little event has dis∣concerted
me; for though I am sure your brother's
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
friendship would be of very little consequence to
Falkland, yet one would not wish a young man in
his setting out in life should create to himself enemies.
You, my Sidney, who have been used to much
rougher incidents, will not, I hope, let this affect
you.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss ARNOLD to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Pall-mall, <DATE>Jan. 4th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Wanted not this, my dear Sophy, I wanted not
this last blow to weigh down my heart already but
too much depressed. Your brother has told you, I
suppose, what passed last night between him and Sir
George; but he little knows how miserable the con∣sequence
of his indiscretion has made me. Oh, my
dear, I was not abroad when you call'd on me
this morning; but my uncle is so full of resentment
against Sir Edward, that he insists that my sister and
I should break off our acquaintance with your family,
more especially as he knows your brother has some
designs on Cecilia. How could Mr. Falkland be so
thoughtless, why would he be so cruel to me, as to
cut off, by his imprudence, the only hope that can
sustain my life, that of sometimes seeing him; for
might he not easily have guessed the consequence of
offending my uncle Bidulph? They are the worst that
Can be conceived, he <HI>shuts his doors against him for
ever.</HI> Dear Miss Audley, tell. Falkland, if he has
any regard for my happiness, he will endeavour to
retrieve his error, (for he certainly committed one)
by making the best apology he can to Sir George;
else think what I must feel on our being deprived of
the fight of each other. 'Tis impossible I can see him
any where but either here or at your house; at pre∣sent
both are interdicted by my uncle, and at the only
third place where there might be a possibility of our
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
meeting, I cannot take the liberty of proposing it.
This is at Mrs. B—'s; but Mr. B—was himself so
much offended at the behaviour of both the gentle∣men,
that I doubt whether he would permit Mr.
Falkland's visits at his house.</P>
<P>I have not closed my eyes the whole night. Cecilia
is exceedingly concerned at what has happened; but
what is <HI>her</HI> cause of uneasiness to mine? I beseech
you, my dear, do not let the part which Mr. Falk∣land
takes in your brother's resentment influence him
to refuse the request I have now made. Tell him I
conjure him to write to my uncle before it be too
late; for it is not with customs of the world as it is
in matters of conscience; and man to <HI>man,</HI> though
not to his Creator, may too late acknowledge
himself in a fault.</P>
<P>How my mama would be shocked to hear of this!
I hardly know what I am writing. No one that I
dare trust with my thoughts, and <HI>you</HI> are taken from
me too! Indeed, Sophy, that is too much, indeed it
is very hard.</P>
<P>If Mr. Falkland should write me a line, let the ser∣vant
who brings it enquire for Hellen; I must be
obliged to trust her with receiving and delivering

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Miss ARNOLD.
[This came inclosed in one from Miss Audley, which
is omitted.]
Friday evening.</OPENER>
<P>I Am sorry to refuse you, my dear Miss Arnold, the
first request you ever made me. Indeed I have so
sincere a regard for you, that if I did not think my
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
own honour at stake upon the present occasion, I
should certainly comply with your desires. A man
should be much more ashamed to defend than to ac∣knowledge
an error, and no one would be more can∣did
than myself on such an occasion; but in the pre∣sent
case there are no measures to be observed.
When I took Sir Edward Audley's part, I thought
him in the right; I do so still; and your uncle may
(as he gave us to understand he would) inform lord
V—when he pleases of our sentiments. As for Sir
George Bidulph, 'tis plain he was glad to lay hold
on any pretence to rid himself of a man whom he has
always treated with unbecoming arrogance. Ask
yourself, therefore, if you would wish to see me sub∣jected
to any farther insults from him. I think you,
who are so extremely delicate yourself, would be
sorry to see less so the friend whom you honour with
your esteem.</P>
<P>I hope the time will come when I shall be at li∣berty
to shew you, without <HI>his</HI> permission, how
much I am</P>
<CLOSER>Your most devoted, &amp;c.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss ARNOLD to Miss AUDLEY.
[In which she inclosed the above letter from Mr.
Falkland.]
<DATE>January 5th.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SOPHY, <HI>read</HI> the inclosed letter, and then tell
me if you really think it was written by Falk∣land?
<HI>You</HI> sent it to me as from him; 'tis his hand∣writing;
but, good God, what is become of the heart
that used to speak to me! Let him refuse my request;
let him, if he pleases, prefer his imaginary notions
of honour to my substantial happiness; let him even
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
absent himself from my sight; but why, why with
such coldness return an answer that has almost chilled
me? The <HI>regard,</HI> he has for me—The <HI>esteem</HI> with
which I <HI>honour</HI> him! Oh, were it <HI>but</HI> esteem, I should
not feel as I do, his indifference. Give him the
within letter; I have not reproached him in it, per∣haps
he was out of temper when he writ to me, and
I would not aggravate his resentment by ill-timed
complaints, of what I <HI>hope,</HI> is but the effects of a
mind, irritated by passion. Yet sure he cannot be
angry with <HI>me!</HI> If my relations behave haughtily to∣wards
him, it is not <HI>my</HI> fault. Ah, Sophy, see what
it is to give away our affections without being autho∣rised
to do so.</P>
<P>[The letter which Miss Arnold writ to Falkland,
and which she mentions in the above, does not
appear.]</P>
<P>Here follow several letters which passed recipro∣cally
between this gentleman and lady. Those of
Miss Arnold are filled with tender complaints of Mr.
Falkland's growing indifference. In his, he defends
himself from the charge with much art and gallantry;
but little shews the lover in any of them. In this
place also are some detached sheets of paper, wherein
Mrs. Askham herself gives some particulars of the
conduct of Mr. Falkland and Sir Edward Audley
whilst they were together in London, very little to
the credit of either of them, and by which it appears
that Sir Edward had but too unhappily succeeded in
debauching the morals of his companion. All this
the editor omits to avoid prolixity, excepting a little
narrative extracted from some letters written by Mr.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Main is mentioned in the former part of these Memoirs. He was brother to Mrs. Askham, and married to the daughter of Mr. Price. He was a linen-draper, and had been settled many years in London.</NOTE> Main to his sister Askham, which he inserts as it
has a material connection with the story.</P>
<P>Mr. Main in his first letter acquaints his sister that
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
a very beautiful young woman, whom he calls The∣odora
Williams, having lost her parents, (people well
born) who left a numerous family of children all un∣provided
for, was by her relations in the country
sent to London, and recommended to Mrs. Main's
care, in order to place her either in some genteel
family, or to procure for her plain work, as she was
very excellent at her needle. That Mrs. Main not
having it immediately in her power to fix her agree∣ably
in the former way, had put her in a lodging near
her own house, and consistantly furnished her with
work. That having employed her to make up
some linen for Sir Edward Audley, he had accident∣ally
seen her <HI>at their shop,</HI> Mrs. Main having sent for
her to take the linen home whilst Sir Edward, who
had just bought it of them, was there. In conse∣quence
of this unlucky interview, the young woman
in about a fortnight afterwards disappeared from her
lodgings, and no one could give any account of her.
Mr. Main in this letter, which is long and circum∣stantial,
hints his strong suspicions of Sir Edward
Audley's being the person who had decoyed her
away, and expresses the utmost regret at this accident,
as the girl was the daughter of an old friend of his
for whom he had the utmost regard.</P>
<P>In his next letter, he informs his sister that after a
fruitless search of nine or ten days, he had at length,
by accident, discovered the place of her retreat.
That passing through a court in Bedford-street one
night, he had seen Sir Edward Audley go into a
house of no reputable appearance; and judging that
this was the place where the unhappy girl was con∣cealed,
he had resolved, in the warmth of his honest
zeal, to go to her next morning, in order, if possible,
to prevail with her to go home with him; or in case
she refused, (to use his own expressions) to overwhelm
her with reproaches.</P>
<P>He, with difficulty, was admitted up stairs to the
dining-room, where he found the poor Theodora
alone, her eyes red and swollen with tears. It was
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
about nine o'clock in the morning, and Sir Edward
Audley, who was then in the house, was not yet up.</P>
<P>The young woman related to him the particulars
of her story, which I shall endeavour to compress in as
narrow a compass as possible.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Audley, said she, after having called on
me two or three times under pretence of hastening me
with his linen, at last writ me a passionate love-let∣ter,
in which he begg'd I would give him an oppor∣tunity
of seeing me alone the next evening, not having
had it in his power to speak his sentiments to me, as
I always had with me a person whom I had taken in
to help me at my work. Convinced that Sir Edward
could have no warrantable designs, I shewed his
letter to this woman, expressing, at the same time,
my indignation at his request; but she only laughed
at my fears, telling me I was not the first young per∣son
of obscure condition whose fortune had been
made by her beauty; that I might, without any dan∣ger,
hear what the gentleman had to say, and that it
would be time enough to reject his proposals if I
found them dishonest. Seduced by the arguments of
this person, and dazzled by the appearance of Sir
Edward Audley, I suffered myself to be prevailed on
to grant him the interview he desired, without the
presence of a third person. In this visit he explained
his designs at full; and after making use of all the
persuasions in his power, he concluded with the offer
or a handsome settlement. I hope you will believe
me, Sir, when I tell you I rejected this offer, with
the contempt it deserved; assuring Sir Edward I
would give directions to the people with whom I
lodged never to admit him into their house again.</P>
<P>He retired upon this, bestowing high encomiums
on my virtue, and declaring he loved me more than
ever.</P>
<P>I received a letter from him the next day, in which
he told me, that finding it impossible for him to live
without me, he had takes a resolution to marry me;
and that, as in consequence of this it was necessary
he should have some farther conversation with me,
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
he requested I would once more permit him to see
me alone. I will own, Sir, my vanity was not
proof against the flattering prospects that now open∣ed
before me. I saw him that evening, and he re∣newed
to me the same protestations that he had made
in his letter; but telling me it was of the utmost
importance to him to conceal (at least during his
mother's life) a marriage so disproportionate, I must
consent to have it performed with the utmost secrecy,
and in a private house, as he would not hazard the
having it solemnized in a church. I readily enough
agreed to this, desiring only permission to acquaint
you and Mrs. Main with my good fortune. But this
Sir Edward positively forbid, telling me you would
not fail to acquaint his mother with the design, which
would be the sure means to overthrow it; and this
it was, Sir, which made me guilty of so much ingra∣titude
as to conceal the whole affair from you. I then
told Sir Edward, I would desire nothing more than
the liberty of having a friend of mine present as a
witness. He reproached me with my distrust of
him; but asked me in whom it was that I intended to
repose this confidence. I named the person he had
seen two or three times with me, as the only ac∣quaintance
I had in London, your family excepted
He said, people in that low condition were seldom
to be trusted; but having asked several particulars
relative to her, he at last consented that she should
be present at our marriage.</P>
<P>He then appointed as our place of meeting, this
very house; and telling me he should have a clergy∣man
ready at ten o'clock the next morning, desired
me to bring my friend with me at that hour; after
which he took his leave with all the respect due to a
woman he intended to make his wife.</P>
<P>I failed not to inform my acquaintance the same
night with this happy turn in my affairs, requesting
she would be in readiness the next morning to go
with me to the appointed place, where I thought my
good fortune was to be ensured for life.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127"/>
I had agreed to call on her at her lodgings, and
you may be sure, I was punctual to my time; but I
was not a little surprized and mortified to find she
was gone out. She had, however left a note for me
with the maid of the house, wherein she told me,
that, “having been sent for in a violent hurry by a
relation who was dying, she had been obliged to
obey the summons; but as she was certain she
should not be detained long, she desired me to pro∣ceed
on my way, and that she would insallibly
meet me by the hour agreed on at the appointed
place, as it lay in her way in returning home.” It
was now ten o'clock; I made no doubt but she
would keep her word, and unsuspicious of any design,
I got into a chair, and ordered myself to be carried to
this fatal house. Sir Edward Audley met me at the
bottom of the stairs, and led me directly up to the
dining-room, where I found a clergyman sitting in
his canonical habit. Sir Edward asked me where was
my friend? I answered him by putting her note into
his hand: I suppose, said he, she will be here pre∣sently.
Half an hour however passed away without
any appearance of her coming; Sir Edward grew
uneasy and impatient, telling me if I could have
confided in <HI>him,</HI> he would have provided a witness
who would have been more punctual. The clergy∣man
now took out his watch, and saying he was
under an indispensible necessity of going at eleven
o'clock to read prayers at the church which he served,
told us if the ceremony was retarded he could not
possibly stay. I looked fearfully at Sir Edward, and
ventured to ask him if it would not do as well another
day? resolving, if he consented to it, to take the
opportunity of going away with the clergyman.
But he replied with an oath, If it is not done now,
Madam, it <HI>never</HI> shall; I cannot bear to be treated
with so much distrust. The clergyman then said,
that though it was more regular to have a witness,
yet as the marriage would be equally good without
one, he would make no scruple of joining us, if I
would consent to it. Sir Edward said nothing; but
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
walked about the room seemingly very much dis∣pleased.
What could I do, Sir, in such a situation?
I was afraid of losing a good establishment by being
over scrupulous; and depending on what the clergy∣man
said, I turned to Sir Edward and told him, if the
marriage was lawful, I had no objection. In short,
Sir, we were married, and immediately after the
ceremony was over, the clergyman shipp'd into the
other room, where having staid a few minutes he
returned again into the dining-room for his hat,
which having hastily taken up, he went away. I
observed that he was without his gown, and that
even the hat he took up was that of a layman. I
asked Sir Edward the meaning of this: he told me,
that to avoid observation he had himself desired him
to come in that diess, that he had sent his robes before
him, which he had, put on for decency sake; but
that he had pulled them off in going away for the
same reason that he had come without them. As this
seemed likely enough, it raised no doubts in my
mind.</P>
<P>Sir Edward said, that if I approved of those lodg∣ings,
he would recommend it to me to stay in them,
as he believed I could not find any others more pri∣vate;
but that I must consent to go by a different
name from that I had a right to bear, as he himself
was not known to the people of the house by his
real name. I consented to every thing he proposed;
and though I own I did not think these lodgings hand∣some
enough for <HI>his</HI> wife, I thought them full good
enough for me. He added, that he would pass as many
of his hours with me as he possibly could; but tha this
mother, with whom he lived, being very old and
extremely captious, he was obliged to dedicate much
of his time to her.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward likes to lie very long in bed, he
had given orders that he should never be disturbed in
a morning till he rang his bell. I rose the next
morning about eight o'clock, and leaving Sir Edward
asleep, came softly into this room.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"/>
A maid who had been hired to wait on me, came
up stairs soon after, and said there was a person
below who wanted to speak to Mr. Edwards, (the
name Sir Edward had assumed.) She said she had
informed the man that she dared not to disturb her
master; but he told her his business was very urgent,
and he must see him. I ventured upon this to go in
to tell him, that such a person attended to speak
with him. He desired that I would order the maid
to send him up, and requested I would withdraw into
the dining-room. I did as he directed me. Sir
Edward rose immediately, and coming into the room
where I was, said his servant had brought him a
letter which he must answer directly; he called for
pen, ink, and paper, and returned again into his
own chamber.</P>
<P>I stepped down stairs in the interval to give some
directions to my maid, and came up again in the
instant that the man came out of Sir Edward's room,
with the letter in his hand which his master had just
written. But, Sir, what was my surprize, when in
the person of this pretended servant, I saw the very
clergyman who had married me the day before. His
dress indeed was different, for though he was not
in a livery, he had not on the grave cloaths that the
clergy usually wear. He bowed to me as he passed
me on the stairs, but did not speak. I was struck at
the sight, and could not tell what to make of it. I
was certain it was the very man, for I had sat so long
in his company that I was sure I could not be mista∣ken;
yet it appeared so unlikely, that I thought it
best not to mention it to Sir Edward, for fear of of∣fending
him by my suspicions.</P>
<P>I entered the dining-room at the same time that
Sir Edward came out from the bed-chamber. He
asked me in a sudden manner where I had been? and
having told him, he answered, My dear, I should
wish for the present you would not let yourself be
seen by strangers. I replied, no-body had seen me
but his servant. Did he speak to you? said he,
(with some confusion in his looks.) I answered, he
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
had not. 'Tis a wonder, said Sir Edward, for he is
a forward fellow, and as I have been obliged to trust
him, I concluded he might be disposed to let you see
he was in our secrets. He kept his eyes fixed on me
while he spoke; I made no reply; and he presently
after went out, telling me he had business which he
was afraid would detain him the whole day, but that
he would be with me early in the evening.</P>
<P>When I found myself alone, I could not get the
thoughts of this clergyman out of my head. The
more I considered, the more I was convinced that he
and Sir Edward's man were one and the same person;
but I thought it much more probable that he should
have imposed his servant on me for a parson, than
that he should disguise the visit of this clergyman to
him under colour of his being his servant. Yet what
could I do? I had no witness to my marriage, and I
thought it in vain to speak of it.</P>
<P>I passed the day very unquietly. About ten o'clock
Sir Edward came in, and, to my great astonishment,
another young gentleman with him, whom he said he
had brought to sup with me. He introduced him
to me by the name of Falkland; but did not intro∣duce
me to him, nor call me otherwise than by my
christian name all the evening. I was sadly out of
countenance and vexed; for I thought Mr. Falkland,
though a good-humoured and civil young gentleman,
behaved to me with less respect than was due to Sir
Edward's wife, if he had believed me to be such.
The two gentlemen were in high spirits, and as they
seemed inclined to sit to their bottle, I thought it
proper to retire, and went into my own room.</P>
<P>I had scarce time to shut the door after me, when I
heard Sir Edward ask his companion how he liked me?
You may be sure, Sir, I had the curiosity to listen
to his answer, and putting my ear close to the door,
I heard Mr. Falkland say, “She is very pretty, and
looks very innocent too; I should not take her to
be one of that stamp.” What do you mean by
<HI>stamp?</HI> said Sir Edward. I'd have you to know she
is as modest a girl as any in England. Mr. Falkland
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
laughed, and answered, I suppose you have taken
the poor girl in by the old bait, a promise of mar∣riage?
Sir Edward made some reply, which I could
not hear, and they quickly changed the discourse;
but as my curiosity was so rouzed by what I had al∣ready
heard, that it took away from me all inclina∣tion
to sleep, so I could not leave the spot where I
stood, in expectation of discovering from their dis∣course
something farther of my own miserable situa∣tion;
for it was very plain to me that Sir Edward
had passed me on this gentleman for his kept mistress.
I could learn however, nothing more than that Sir
Edward and his friend were very loose men.</P>
<P>I went to bed in great affliction, considering my∣self,
tho' very innocent in my intention, as living in an
unlawful state. Sir Edward observed my melan∣choly
next morning, and with his usual kindness ask'd
me the reason of it. I told him that I suspected the
man whom I had seen the day before wad the very
person who had married us. Who, my man David?
said Sir Edward, laughing: By my soul, child, he
can make as good a marriage as e'er a parson in
Europe—I interrupted him, Oh, Sir, if you have
had the barbarity to use me thus after all your pro∣mises!
He took me up short, and still in merriment,
If you <HI>fancy</HI> yourself, married, said he, your virtue
is as safe as if an archbishop had joined us: all those
things are in the imagination; but don't turn <HI>wife,</HI>
my dear Dora, by beginning to grumble. Consider
we are in our honey-moon, He then patted me on
the cheek, and bidding me good bye, ran down
stairs.</P>
<P>I won't trouble you, Sir, with my sorrowful re∣flections;
I shall only say that I was now convinced
that I was undone; and had great reason to believe
that Sir Edward, as soon as he grew weary of me,
would abandon me, and that it was not in my power
to redress myself.</P>
<P>In the midst of my uneasiness, my acquaintance,
who had so shamefully broke her promise to me,
came in to see me. She made some excuses for it
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
not worth repeating. Then looking about her, smil∣ing,
Indeed, Miss Williams, said she, I am very glad
to see you so well settled. I hope Sir Edward's love
may last; but at worst, to be sure, he will take care
to provide handsomely for you. I was provoked,
and almost confounded to hear her talk in this man∣ner.
I have not forgot myself, said I, nor do I want
to take the airs of a lady upon me; but I should be
glad you would remember that I am Sir Edward
Audley's wife. She burst out a laughing, You don't
want to persuade me to that sure? said she. Not
persuade you! answered I; why, what reason have
you to doubt it? Lord, child, said she, I only thought
you wanted a handsome excuse for putting yourself
into Sir Edward's hands, when you told me he in∣tended
to marry you; for do you fancy any gentle∣man
would bring his wife into such a place as <HI>this?</HI>
I know nothing of the place, answered I; but 'tis
very certain we were married here the day before
yesterday. Be it so, said she, (with a sneer, as if she
did not credit what I said); I am glad, however, I
was out of the scrape. I was so shocked at this wo∣man's
behaviour, that I knew not what to say. I told
her, as I found she was determined either not to be∣lieve,
or <HI>pretend</HI> not to believe me, that her company
was far from being agreeable to me. She said, if I
was grown so proud, since I had changed my lodg∣ings,
she knew as well as I how to keep her distance;
and adding, she was sorry that she had given herself
the trouble to call on me, she walked down stairs.</P>
<P>I was almost distracted with vexation and shame.
I concluded immediately that this vile woman had
been tampered with by Sir Edward. I recollected
how particularly he had enquired about her when I
first mentioned her to him: and as she was in low cir∣cumstances,
I made no doubt but he had given her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to act in the wicked manner she had done;
knowing very well, to be sure, that though the mar∣riage
ceremony had been performed by his own
servant, yet (I being ignorant of the cheat) had a
witness been present, it would have been lawful;
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
for I remember to have heard of such a thing hap∣pening
in my own neighbourhood in the country.</P>
<P>You may judge, Sir, how miserably I spent the rest
of the day. I saw not Sir Edward till the next night.
He came in about nine o'clock, and was very much
fuddled, but as he was in a good humour, I thought
I could get the truth out of him. I asked him, smil∣ing,
as we fat together, whether it was really his man
David who had married us? Why, ay, said he;
and I'll answer for it, you never were better married
in your life: that's a very clever fellow, let me tell
you. I believe, it, Sir, said I; but still I am afraid
the marriage won't hold. It will hold as long as any
other marriage would with <HI>me,</HI> said he; that is as
long as I shall like my wife.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not in a condition to be talked to seriously
at that time, therfore I forbore saying any thing far∣ther
on the subject; but when I would have renewed
it next morning, he either really had or pretended to
have forgotten what had passed the night before. He
endeavoured to laugh me out of my apprehensions;
but without giving me any assurances that they were
ill founded. In short, he told me at last, that he
should always expect to pass those hours agreeably
that he spent with me, otherwise I must not hope for
much of his company. I was afraid to urge him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what resource had I? I had thrown myself
fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a under the protection of my only friends, and
kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not whither to go. I saw too well that
Sir Edward did not consider me as his wife: yet I
was sensible I did not deserve a worse name. I have
passed every day since in the same unquiet state; Sir
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my scruples into ridicule. I pressed
hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>terday, if he really meant me fair, that, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my mind easy, he would consent that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> married over again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in presence of a
witne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, even of that servant who I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound was al∣ready
in our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cret. He re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented the proposal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and told me, I had taken a very wrong way
to secure his affections. I cried almost the whole
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
night; for I am determined rather to submit to the
lowest station, than to live with him upon those
terms.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is my unfortunate story; and though I
dreaded of all things to see either you or Mrs. Main,
yet I am now rejoiced at our meeting, that you may
advise me what to do.</P>
<P>I told the poor creature (proceeds Mr. Main] that
I was afraid her case was without remedy; for that
if Sir Edward was resolved not to acknowledge her
as his wife, I did not see how it was in her power to
oblige him to do it; for that having no witness, the
man who performed the marriage ceremony, would
undoubtedly, if he was (as she believed) the servant
of Sir Edward, deny the matter as well as his master.
I shall, however, said I, speak to him before I leave
the house: and after I have heard what he has to say,
shall be the better enabled to advise you. She seemed
terrified at the thoughts of what might result from
my questioning Sir Edward; but I bid her not make
herself uneasy, telling her, that in a just cause I was
not afraid of any man living.</P>
<P>Sir Edward rose soon after, and entered the dining-room
with the utmost carelessness, little expecting
to find any one there but the poor deluded girl. He
stopped short, when he saw me, and reddened up to
his eyes. Your humble servant, Sir Edward. Have
you any business with me, Mr. Main? Sir, I should
be glad you would permit me to speak a few words
to you. You know where I live, Sir; what is the
reason that you come to seek me here? I did not ex∣pect
to find you here, Sir Edward; my business was
with this poor young gentlewoman. But since I
<HI>have</HI> met with you—He interrupted me, turning
peevishly to the poor girl, who hung down her head,
I suppose madam, said he, 'tis you who have sent for
your friend Main? I thought I had warned you
sufficiently on that head. Sir Edward, she did not
send for me, answered I; but as she was put by her
friends under mine and my wife's care, I thought it
my duty to search her out—Well, Sir, now you
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
have found her, what then? Sir Edward, you must
pardon me for asking you a free question; Is this
young woman your wife? for she tells me, she is
married to you. Prithee, honest Main, said he, do∣not
ask impertinent questions; for you may take it
for granted I shall not answer one of them. This la∣dy
is my property; and I don't don't know that you
have any thing to do either with her or me. Sir Ed∣ward,
I don't pretend to have any thing to do with
<HI>you;</HI> but I think myself accountable for the actions
of a young person whose conduct I was desired to
watch over. The girl is discontented with her situa∣tion,
If she be <HI>not</HI> your wife, and is willing to leave
you, I think the laws both of God and man will
authorize me to take her from infamy. On the other
hand, if she <HI>be</HI> married to you, though I must ac∣knowledge,
that, as well for yours as your family's
sake, I would have prevented it, had it been in my
power; yet as that is now too late, I will give you
my oath, if you require it, to keep your secret, pro∣vided
you will let me see the clergyman who married
you, and permit me to get a certificate from him of
his having done so. I told you before, said he, that
I would answer none of your questions; and as for
your part, madam, since you have been so imprudent
as to betray your own interests, I shall give you no
farther satisfaction on the subject; only I shall take
care to remove you to a place where it will not be
in your power to expose either yourself or me. By
what authority, Sir Edward, will you remove her?
By my own, Sir; she belongs to me. Mrs. Dora,
said I, are you Sir Edward's wife? We were married,
answered the poor thing, the tears running down her
face. You hear what she says, Sir Edward? Why,
what the deuce would you <HI>have</HI> her say? answered
he. Ay, but, Sir Edward, what do <HI>you</HI> say? No∣thing,
Sir, I <HI>will</HI> say nothing; but take her from
me at your peril! Sir, if she be your wife, you will
have the laws on your side; but as she looks upon
it only to have been a mock marriage, performed by
your own servant, and in all likelihood, the intended
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
witness suborned to be out of the way, she does not
consider you as having any authority to detain her;
therefore, if she is willing to go with me, I think
myself bound to receive and protect her.</P>
<P>He seemed confounded at what I said; and I be∣lieve
the firm manner in which I spoke, convinced
him that I was neither to be trifled with nor fright∣ened.</P>
<P>You know very well, answered he, that I am un∣der
such restraints with regard to my family, that I
cannot do myself public justice in an affair of this
kind; otherwise you would not dare to behave thus.
But assure yourself, if you attempt, either by con∣trivance
or force, to take this girl from me, I shal
treat you as I would a robber. I hope, Sir Edward,
said I, you have more honour than to assault an
unarmed man, who is under the shelter of your roof;
I, therefore, am not, at present, alarmed at your
threats. As for what may happen hereafter, I shall
only say, that I will always defend myself against
violence; but as I do not think myself obliged to
fight, you may depend upon it, Sir Edward, I shall
have recourse to a legal reparation for any injury
you may attempt against me; and I must take the
liberty to tell you, that I look upon this young wo∣man
as under <HI>my</HI> protection, not <HI>yours,</HI> unless you
convince me that she is your wife, which, I again
repeat to you, that I will keep secret. He swore a
great oath, and asked me what reason I had to doubt
her being so. Her own account, answered I; she be∣lieves
herself deceived, and I own I am of the same
opinion. She is a fool, and you are another, answered
he. Sir Edward, you shall not provoke me by using
hard names, Do you insist, madam, (turning to the
young woman) upon the proof which I have required
of Sir Edward? or are you satisfied to live with him
without it? She took courage at seeing me so reso∣lute
in her defence. I will not live with him with∣out
it, answered she; and if he refuses it, I shall
look upon it as disowning me. I should be as un∣willing
as you, Sir, added she, applying herself to
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
Sir Edward, to draw on you the resentment of your
friends; nor have I any desire of being known for
your wife, till you shall think proper to acknowledge
me; but I will not be passed upon your acquaintance
for a kept woman; for such, I am sure, Mr. Falk∣land
thinks me. If we were lawfully married, it can∣not
hurt you to put me in possession of a proof of it;
and, in that case, I am ready to retire wherever you
shall command me, and shall willingly, if you desire
it, hide myself from every body but yourself. As
for Mr. Main, as I have already told him every cir∣cumstance
that has passed, he may as well be trusted
with the proof of our marriage as myself; more espe∣cially
as he has offered you his oath, if you require
it, to keep the secret as long as it shall be thought
necessary.</P>
<P>The spirit with which the girl made this fair pro∣posal,
put Sir Edward with his back to the wall; he
affected an air of indifference, and, swinging him∣self
back and forward in his chair, Upon my soul,
madam, I did not think yon had been so knowing in
the ways of the world. I thought I had got an in∣experienced
girl; but I find—She interrupted him
briskly, Sir, you have got an honest girl, and, if the
expression became me, I would say, a girl of honour—
Mighty fine, ma'am! were you ever play'd any trick
before? or is this your first adventure? The poor girl
burst into tears. 'Tis unmanly in you, Sir, to add insults
to deceit. By Jupiter, said he, I believe the girl has
been on the stage! that is so theatrically pretty!
But come, Mr. Main, added he, rising, I must desire
the favour of you to walk down stairs. I will offer
you no violence; only I advise you, as a friend, to
go home quietly, and mind your shop; otherwise
without doing you the least injury, I will shew you
the way to the street-door.</P>
<P>The poor girl now clung to my arm, and declared
she would go with me, as she was determined not to
stay another night under the same roof with Sir Ed∣ward.
He pulled her roughly from me, calling her
an ungrateful little fool, who would sacrifice both
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
her duty and her interest to a ridiculous whim. I
was about to make him a reply, when we heard some
one tap at the dining-room door, and, without wait∣ing
to be answered, Mr Falkland walked into the
room. He seemed surprized at seeing me there; but
without saying any more than civilly asking me how
I did, he desired to speak with Sir Edward in the
next room. They both retired. I heard Sir Edward
(who you know, speaks loud and vehemently) swear
two or three oaths, and, by an imperfect bit of a
sentence that now and then reached our ears, it seemed
as if Mr. Falkland had come to warn him of some
danger; and I judged it to be that of an impatient
and very urgent creditor; for I heard Sir Edward
say, I wrote the scoundrel word yesterday of my
difficulties, though he is so pressing.</P>
<P>As I wished for nothing more than to bring to a
conclusion, with as little noise as possible, the un∣lucky
affair in which I was engaged, I intended wait∣ing
till Mr. Falkland should be gone, in order to re∣ceive,
if it was possible, Sir Edward Audley's final
determination with regard to the unfortunate girl;
but she, who had her thoughts only bent upon quit∣ting
him, took it into her head that this would be a
fair opportunity of doing so, as it would save me
from any farther indignity, and herself from the ter∣rors
of any thing that might ensue, in case he should
forcibly oppose her going away. She proposed mak∣ing
her escape directly, with an eagerness which
shewed how much her heart was set upon it. For
my part, I thought it the best course we could take;
and therefore, without hesitating, I took her under
the arm, and, just as she was, without either hood
or cloak, I led her softly down stairs, out at the
street-door, and, hastening our steps, we were in a
minute out of the court. I popped her into a hack∣ney-coach,
on the stand in Bedford-street, and, get∣ting
in after her, we drove directly to my house;
where having told my wife, in few words, her un∣happy
story, she received her very cordially.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>
This is the substance of Mr. Main's second letter
to Mrs. Askham. And in a third (dated a few days
after) he tells her, that his wife and he, not thinking
it adviseable that the young gentlewoman should
continue in London, lest she should fall a second time
into the hands of Sir Edward Audley, they had im∣mediately
come to a resolution to send her out of
town, an opportunity just then very luckily offer∣ing.
A lady, who was their customer, and who
used to lodge at their house whenever she came to
London, which was but very rarely, had, a few
days before, written to Mrs. Main, to request she
would look out for a genteel servant for her to wait
upon herself. It was to this lady, therefore, they
determined to send her; but before she went, they
thought it proper that she should write a few lines to
Sir Edward Audley; which she did, in the following
words, Mrs. Main having dictated them to her.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“AS I should be as unwilling to be suspected of in∣fidelity,
or even levity, as I should be to be guilty of
a breach of duty, I think myself bound to declare,
in the most solemn manner, that no other motive has
induced me to take the step I have done, but a belief
next to conviction that you have deceived me, and
that I cannot live with you, without considering my∣self
in a state of infamy. Your conduct to Mr. Main,
as it has left me no room to doubt of my misfortune,
so it has almost deprived me of hope; for your love,
Sir, if you should still have any for me, can never be
of any value to me, so long as you think me unwor∣thy
of your esteem. I was highly sensible of the ho∣nour
you did me, in condescending to make me your
wife: had you thought me worthy of the title, I
should have endeavoured, by my gratitude and hu∣mility,
to have in time, perhaps, appeared not unde∣serving
of it.</P>
<P>By the time this letter comes to your hands I shall
be out of your reach; but if you should ever wish to
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
recal from poverty, grief, and shame, the poor
wretch, who but for you would have lived contented
in the former, and perhaps had never known the
latter, my friend Mr. Main will know where to find
me. I shall only beg the favour of you, Sir, to give
orders that the few things I left behind me at the
lodgings may be sent to that gentleman's house. You
will know, without my signing a name, which I dare
not assume, from whom this comes.”</P>
<P>Though my wife (continues Mr. Main) thought it
adviseable to tell Sir Edward that the poor girl would
be out of his reach before he should receive her let∣ter,
she yet judged it necessary to keep her in
town till she should recover her cloaths, as she had
nothing in the world but what she had then on her.
We sent the letter to lady Audley's house, and the
same night all the young woman's cloaths were
brought to mine by a porter; but no message from
Sir Edward. Concluding from thence that he meant
the affair should drop quietly, and seeing no possibility
of the unhappy girl's being able to do herself justice;
I thought she had no part to take but to retire into
the country as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The following day I received a visit from Mr.
Falkland. I am come to you, Mr. Main, said he,
from Sir Edward Audley, who has received a very
extraordinary letter from the young person whom you
took the other day from her lodgings. She talks in
that letter of a marriage, and accuses Sir Edward of
having betrayed her. I will not pretend to justify him
for having seduced a girl to quit an honest livelihood
in order to live with him upon an improper footing;
but I am to assure you from him, that the story of a
marriage ceremony having been performed, is all an
invention of her's, contrived to save her credit with
you and Mrs. Main, after you had discovered where
she was.</P>
<P>My wife, interrupted Mr. Falkland here; Sir, said
she, I should be very unwilling to believe that you
are any way privy to Sir Edward's wicked designs;
on the contrary, I am inclined to think that, he has
really imposed on you, as he would now endeavour
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
to do on us; but pray, Mr. Falkland, let me ask
you, if this poor young creature had voluntarily
consented to live with Sir Edward as a mistress,
what should induce her to quit him so suddenly?
for she complains of no ill treatment from him. So
far otherwise, she acknowledges he was very fond
of her; and had she meant nothing more than to have
saved her credit with us, she needed only to have
told Mr. Main she was married, and that it was
necessary to keep the affair secret. Sir Edward, I
dare say, would not have scrupled to have confirmed
this, if his bare assertion would have been taken
without any farther proof; and in that case, it would
not have been Mr. Main's business to have interposed
any farther.</P>
<P>My good Madam, said Mr. Falkland, (whose
words you know are as smooth as oil) what you say
is very true, and it was the very question I myself
put to Sir Edward when he shewed me the young
person's letter, and requested I would come to you
to explain matters; but Sir Edward's answer to me
was, that in the warmth of his pursuit of this girl,
he had made her some promises of marriage. I
reproached him for this; but Sir Edward, you know,
is a very gay man, and too much devoted to his
pleasures; he only laughed at me, said he had made
the same promises twenty times before, and that she
was the first who had ever claimed the performance
of them. That it was a thing of course, and meant
no more than to give a girl a pretence for yielding to
her own inclinations with a better grace, and that
he thought the person in question had experience
enough to know how far men were to be trusted on
those occasions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Main lifted up her hands and eyes at this,
Mr. Falkland inveighed against the profligacy of the
present times, and said he was very sorry his intimate
connections with Sir Edward Audley (which it was
not in his power to break) had led him to the know∣ledge
of so much of it. He then proceeded to tell us
that the girl, in consequence of Sir Edward's foolish
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
protestations, had pressed him earnestly to marry her;
that he had endeavoured at first only to evade her
instances, and thought in a little time she would
have dropt them; but as he now found her an artful
creature who had consented to an union with him
only from motives of interest, and that she had vanity
enough to suppose he would come into any terms
rather than part with her, he was determined not to
give himself any farther trouble about her: but that
she might not reproach him with having lost her time
to no purpose, he had sent her fifty guineas: Which
Mr. Falkland at the same time presenting to me in a
purse, begg'd I would take the trouble of remitting
to her where-ever she was, and that the affair might
not be mentioned any more, as he was sure it would
give lady Audley great uneasiness.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Falkland I desired to be excused from
taking a sum of money which I was certain the young
gentlewoman herself would reject with scorn. That
as I saw she had nothing to expect from Sir Edward's
justice, she should not be obliged to his charity.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland put up the purse again into his
pocket, saying he had no more to do in the affair;
but added, he hoped out prepossessions in favour of
the young person, would not lead us to believe every
thing she said to the prejudice of a gentleman, who,
though wild and extravagant, was not capable, he
was sure, of so base an action as that with which she
charged him. He then took his leave, telling us he
was sorry, very sorry on our account for what had
happened, and again begged that it might not be
mentioned at Woodberry, lest by that means it
should come round to lady Audley's ears; for which
reason I request, dear sister, that you will keep the
whole affair to yourself, as perhaps it might draw on
Mr. Falkland some displeasure from his best friend.</P>
<P>We informed poor Theodora of what had passed;
her grief is not to be expressed. She declared with
the most solemn attestations that could be framed,
that she had spoken nothing but the truth; and said,
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
she was the more affected at his baseness as she ac∣knowledged
she loved him.</P>
<P>There was nothing now to be done but to remove
her from the scene of her misfortune, and accord∣ingly
we yesterday sent her down to the country to
the house of the lady whom she is to serve; where
the poor creature may pine away the rest of her life
in sorrow, while the base man who has doubly
betrayed her triumphs in the success of his wick∣edness.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B—to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 1st.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am so so vexed, my dear Sidney, I hardly know
how to collect my thoughts, and still less to
arrange my words in such a manner as to convey
those thoughts to you, without giving you more
pain than, I hope, the occasion demands; but to
say the worst at once, matters are in a very disa∣greeable
situation at your brother's.—Sir George, I
am afraid, carries the authority with which you have
invested him too far. He urges Cecilia without
ceasing, to accept of lord V—. Lady Sarah is violent
in her instances; my lord himself is extremely assi∣duous
in his courtship. Miss Arnold, influenced by
her uncle, tenderly presses her sister to make lord
V—happy, and to oblige all her friends. Mr. B—and
I, at your's as well as Sir George's request, have
joined our entreaties, but all to no purpose. Cecilia
remains inflexible, and has begg'd her uncle's per∣mission
to return to Oxfordshire; which he has re∣fused,
unless <HI>you</HI> should absolutely <HI>command</HI> her re∣turn,
which, to use his own words, “he supposes
you will have a little more prudence than to do.”
I own I am at a loss to account for this unconquer∣able
obstinacy in a young creature bred up as your
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
daughter has been. Sidney, I am afraid there is
some prepossession in the case, of which you are
ignorant. Perhaps Sir Edward Audley,—yet I do
not think 'tis he either; she assured Sir George in
my presence, with an indifference that carried not
the least mark of affectation in it, that she had not
for him the smallest attachment. She had two other
lovers, both agreeable men, who knows—</P>
<P>I am interrupted; Miss Cecilia Arnold, the servant
tells me, is in the drawing-room. She is without
her sister; an odd visit enough, my dear, for you
must know this is a good Sunday morning on which
I am scribbling to you, and it is now church-time;
but I am not yet well enough to go out. I go to
attend your daughter; you shall know the result of
our conference.</P>
<P>An odd visit I said it was, before I had seen
Cecilia; I now think it much more so. I found her
alone, her pretty little face full of embarrassment.
She made an apology for coming at so improper an
hour; but said it was the only time which she could
command. Lady Sarah, said she, <HI>now</HI> never suffers
me to stir abroad without her, except to church;
as her ladyship seldom rises early enough for the
morning service. And I omitted attending that duty
to-day in order to get the opportunity of speaking
to you alone, as I concluded your indisposition still
confined you. Indeed, madam, I am made exceed∣ingly
uneasy, they drive me to extremes, I am quite
miserable, I can't bear it; and I am come to beseech
you, madam, to write to my mama, and to beg of
her to recall me home. You know my uncle de∣clared
he would not suffer me to return without my
mama desired it; I am sure she will do any thing
that you shall recommend to her. Do, dear madam,
(pressing eagerly my hand) conjure my mama to send
for me.</P>
<P>She spoke so rapidly, and with so much earnestness,
that I could not interrupt her before; but now
assuming a very grave countenance, You know,
Miss Cecilia, said I, that there is nothing I would not
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
do to promote your real interests; but you will
pardon me, if I tell you that I do not think the step
you would have me take could in any wise contribute
to them; neither do I imagine that it would be at all
becoming in me to interfere in the manner you would
have me. I have already taken my party; Sir George
and lady Sarah have both made use of the influence
they supposed I had over you, in order to induce
you to yield to the desires of all your family. I <HI>have</HI>
used my best endeavours, and though they have
not succeeded, I cannot think of giving up the interests
of all those who have a right to your obedience,
in order to assist you to avoid their importunities.</P>
<P>She seemed abashed at my rebuke, and after a short
silence was about to reply, when we were inter∣rupted
by the sudden appearance of a very unex∣pected
visitor.</P>
<P>Your son, Falkland, was shewn into the room
where we were sitting. Cecilia started at his entrance
—I absolutely <HI>stared,</HI> for I was astonished at seeing
him. He made his compliments to me with polite∣ness,
though with a certain degree of even something
more than <HI>ease,</HI> which convinced me he had mixed
much with the gay world since his arrival in London.
He asked pardon for the liberty he had taken in just
stepping in as he passed by, which he acknowledged
he had been induced to do from seeing Sir George
Bidulph's chariot at the door; and concluding that
one or both of the Miss Arnolds were with me, (for
he knew that neither lady Sarah nor Sir George made
such early visits) he relied on my goodness to forgive
his impatience to ask his sisters how they did, as he
was denied the means of seeing them any where else;
he added, with an air both of sincerity and respect,
that exclusive of any other motive than the pleasure
of seeing <HI>me,</HI> he should long since have done himself
that honour, if he had not thought his visit would
have been unacceptable to one so much the friend of
lord V—and Sir George Bidulph as was Mr. B—.
He reddened as he spoke these last words, which
shewed me the resentment he still had in his heart
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
against them both. As I knew Mr. B—'s mind on
the occasion, I could make no other reply than a
civil compliment at large, which was by no means
an encouragement to his visits.</P>
<P>Sidney, this boy has an infinity of address, and
something so captivating in his manner, that however
mal apropos his company appeared at this juncture, I
could not help being pleased with it.</P>
<P>Mr. B—was not at home; and to say the truth, I
was not sorry for the interruption, as I did not chuse
to be pressed any farther on the subject of Cecilia's
visit to me, and I imagined that after the repulse I
had already given her, she would not be sond of
renewing the conversation; but I was mistaken, she
was too full of it to let it drop so easily. After a few
specches had passed between Falkland and me, he
addressed himself to Cecilia, and asked her coldly,
<HI>When am I to wish you joy, Madam?</HI> Cecilia answer∣ed
with quickness, “When you see me delivered
from persecution, if ever that will be.” Persecu∣tion!
repeated Falkland. Yes, replied your daugh∣ter,
all my friends have combined to make me un∣happy;
they would force me to marry lord V—, I
<HI>never</HI> will. And she pronounced the word <HI>never</HI>
with a most decisive energy.</P>
<P>You wrong your friends, my dear, said I, when
you accuse them of using force; they have hitherto
only endeavoured to persuade, and, I dare say, never
mean to carry their authority farther. She shook
her head, Ah, Madam, you don't know what <HI>sort</HI> of
persuaders my uncle and aunt are. Their requests
are commands, and their persuasions are threats, and
I dread even downright violence from their authority.
If I were at home, I am sure I could depend upon
the tenderness of the best of mothers. She knows
not what I suffer.</P>
<P>She could say no more, and seemed ready to burst
into tears.</P>
<P>Why do you not write to your mama, said Falkland,
and entreat her permission to return to Woodberry?
It was in order to prevail on Mrs. B—to do this for
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
me, answered Cecilia, that I have waited on her
to-day, And will you, Madam? cried Falkland,
briskly. I answered him pretty much in the same
terms I had before done your daughter; then added,
And now, Mr. Falkland, let me appeal to your own
good sense (all little prejudices apart that you may
have conceived against lord V—) is he not in every
respect a desirable match for Miss Cecilia, and one
to which she cannot have any reasonable objection?
I then enumerated all the personal merits, and every
other advantage which lord V—possessed, and desired
he would give me his opinion freely. I believe every
thing you say of him to be true, Madam, was his
answer. Ought he then to be rejected, Mr. Falk∣land?
Cecilia's <HI>heart</HI> alone can answer that question,
Madam. Cecilia was silent, and seemed as if in
expectation of hearing what we should say farther on
the subject. I wish, said I, my lord V—had made
Miss Arnold his choice instead of her sister. I wish
so too, interrupted Falkland. If he had, continued
I, I am inclined to think we should have met with
less opposition. Cecilia presently catched my words;
I wish, said she, my sister were married to lord V—,
and then we might <HI>all</HI> be happy. Does Miss Arnold
like him? demanded Falkland. No, replied Cecilia;
but I believe she likes no one else. These words
apparently slipped from her; she blushed extremely
after she had spoken them, as if conscious of what
they implied. Perhaps, my dear, that is not <HI>your</HI>
case, said I; she smiled in endeavouring to turn it
off; Dear Mrs. B—, can't a young woman <HI>dislike</HI>
one man withour <HI>liking</HI> another? Very possibly,
Cecilia; but how do you know that Miss Arnold's
heart is in such a state of indifference as you say it
is? She never dropp'd to me the least hint to the
contrary. That may be, but <HI>sisters</HI> do not always
make confidents of each other. That's <HI>very</HI> true,
said she, and seemed collected in herself, and as it
were lost in thought for a minute. Falkland, who
had remained silent all this while, now asked Cecilia
what she purposed to do? saying it was a miserable
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
situation to be daily exposed to the addresses of an
unacceptable lover; and at the same time to the
importunate sollicitations of perhaps <HI>indelicate</HI> rela∣tions.
Since Mrs. B—, answered Cecilia, does not
think it prudent to intercede for me, I will write to
my mama myself to implore her protection; if she
will receive me, I shall be very happy to remain as I
am; if not—She stopp'd herself short. What
then, my Cecilia? said Falkland. God knows what
will become of me, said she, rising briskly from her
chair; but indeed I never will be the wife of lord
V—. She then bid me good-morning, and Falkland
taking his leave at the same time, he handed her
down stairs, when, having put her into her chariot,
I observed from my window that he talked with her
for some time, leaning on the door of it, after which
he kissed her hand, and she drove away.</P>
<P>I am utterly at a loss, my dear Sidney, what ad∣vice
to give you, because I am really quite bewilder∣ed
in my conjectures. If Cecilia's heart <HI>be</HI> pre∣possessed,
'tis a secret that she has guarded with the
utmost caution, since even her sister is ignorant of it.
But what if it should turn our that the affection which
you encouraged between them and Falkland in their
childhood, should with regard to this poor young
creature have stepped beyond the bounds which your
maternal care would have prescribed? My dear,
there is nothing improbable in this; yet if it be so,
I am certain that Falkland is as much a stranger to it
as the rest of the world. The manner in which he
asked her the question with relation to her marriage
with lord V—, convinced me he looked upon that
match as on a thing which was likely to take place.</P>
<P>If the case stands thus, I should think it would be
better never to question Cecilia on the subject.
When we extort from another a secret which we
should be very unwilling to learn, and which perhaps
but for our own importunity we never should have
known; it, in my opinion, in some degree binds up
our hands, and prevents us from acting, in conse∣quence
of this acknowledgment, with that freedom
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
which we should otherwise have a right to do, whilst
acting under an apparent ignorance of the person's
secret wishes. On the contrary, if your daughter
should have courage enough voluntarily to disclose
her mind to you, she lays you under no obligation of
shewing the least indulgence in favour of a rash and
imprudent prepossession; nor ought it to wound ei∣ther
your delicacy, or your tenderness to exert your∣self
in doing your utmost to turn her from it. I have
just here thrown out to you my sentiments at large
upon the subject, though perhaps I might have spared
them, as possibly my surmises (for they are nothing
more) may be without foundation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I do not <HI>recommend</HI> it to you to
recall your daughter home; yet I cannot help be∣lieving
that it is more in <HI>your</HI> power than in that of
any other person to bend her little wayward heart
to that submission which her friends require. By all
that I have been able to observe of Cecilia's temper,
it is not one that will patiently submit to controul.
You, my dear, have never had the opportunity of
making any experiments of this kind. You who are
meekness itself have always tempered your autho∣rity
with so much sweetness, that your children, I
believe, never once in their lives had the smallest
merit in their obedience. Is it not natural then to
expect that a young girl full of vivacity, of a high
spirit, and not <HI>unconscious</HI> of her own worth, brought
up with uncommon indulgence, should revolt against
any act of violence done to her inclinations? more
especially by those whose authority she cannot hold
as sacred as that of a mother's. I am not to inform
you that Sir George is rather apt to overdo every
thing, and that he would exert as much force to re∣move
a feather, as to lift an anchor. As for poor
lady Sarah, as she never had the happy knack of
conciliating any one's affections to her, so were she
even mistress of a larger stock of prudence than Hea∣ven
has favoured her with, she could not expect to
have any great influence. Cecilia has extreme good
sense, and as much good nature; but she has a <HI>will,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
Sidney, a will which must be gently led, and not su∣riously
driven; and I am satisfied she would do more
to spare you an hour's uneasiness, than she would to
purchase a crown for herself.</P>
<P>I suppose you will receive a pressing letter from
her, in order to obtain her recal to Woodberry. I
have been minute in laying before you every circum∣stance
that I could gather, and have given my
thoughts to you freely upon the whole, that you
may be the better able to form your own conclu∣sions.
If you judge it proper to send for her, re∣member
you have measures to observe with Sir
George Bidulph, and that it will be incumbent on
you to convince him by your conduct, that you took
this step, in order by your own immediate influence
to promote the general wishes of the family, rather
than to gratify Cecilia in the indulgence of (I cannot
help, my dear, calling it) her perverseness.—</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Feb. 6th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot express to you, dear brother, how ex∣tremely
mortified I am at Cecilia's childish ill∣judged
obstinacy. I was in hopes my lord V—'s
merit, joined to the duty she owes to the will of her
parents, would by this time have determined her in
his favour; but I find I am disappointed in my ex∣pectations,
and deceived in the opinion I had too
partially entertained of my daughter's discretion. I
have received a letter from her in which she has
entreated my permission to return into Oxfordshire.
I know not whether 'tis with your knowledge she
has written it, nor indeed whether it will be prudent
in me to yield to a request, which whim rather than
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
judgment seems to dictate. If you don't disapprove
of it, however, I should be pleased that she were sent
home. Do not imagine, brother, I mean this as an
indulgence to her caprice; so far from it, I have no
other motive to urge my compliance than a belief
that it may be in my power to bow her mind more
effectually by such means as I can use when she is
with me, than by all the arguments to which I could
have recourse by letter, and which I have already
vainly applied. There are a thousand little avenues
to the heart which are shut up, and almost imper∣ceptible
to every one but those who have traced them
from infancy. I think Cecilia loves me, and could
not bear to be a witness to that uneasiness which she
herself caused to so affectionate a mother.</P>
<P>If my lord V—is not already tired with the pur∣suit,
my doors shall be always open to receive him,
and he may depend on having in me a warm and
sincere advocate. A little time may work a favour∣able
change; and Cecilia, who, I am sorry to say,
has discovered on this occasion more wilfulness than
I thought was in her nature) may perhaps, when less
urged, open her eyes voluntarily to her own interest
and happiness, as well as that of her friends.</P>
<P>As for my daughter Dolly, I flatter myself her
behaviour will continue to be such as will give lady
Sarah and you reason to be satisfied with her. I have
no pain with regard to that dear child but on account
of her health; she complains not; but I have my
fears, yet I check them, as I am sure she is in the
hands of very tender relations. I hope lady Sarah
will continue her friendly care of her so long as it
will be convenient to her to retain my daughter in
London.</P>
<P>I shall next week (if nothing intervenes which may
give me cause to change my design) send my chariot
for Cecilia. Mrs. Askham is so kind as to promise
we will go to town for her, in order to bear her
company clown. Be so good as to tell my daughter
this, as I do not mean to answer her letter. Mean
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
while pray inform her that she has, for the first time
in her life, much displeased me by her conduct.</P>

<SALUTE>My dearest Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS you expected that I should set out on my
return to Woodberry with Miss Cecilia as on
to-morrow, and will no doubt be surprized at my
delay, I must beg leave to tell you that I fear I shall
be detained in town a few days longer; but I am
sure you will excuse me when you know the reason,
which is, that my sister Main has just lost her fa∣vourite
child; and as she expects every hour to lie∣in,
my brother has begg'd of me earnestly not to
leave her in her present distress. As I could not
refuse this request, I hope I shall have your per∣mission
to stay with her till the painful minute is
over. I believe this account will make you easy
with regard to our return; I shall therefore now
inform you about your family.</P>
<P>I drove directly to Sir George's on my arrival in
town yesterday, and having sent in my name, was
asked up stairs to lady Sarah's dressing-room. It
was about two o'clock. I found her ladyship at her
toilet; Miss Arnold was at work by her, and Sir
George was reading a news-paper. He tossed it
down when I came in, and I thought looked a little
coldly at me; he rose, however, and bowed to me
very civilly. My lady, who saw me as she sat oppo∣site
the looking-glass, asked me how I did, though
without turning her head about; my dear Miss
Arnold ran and embraced me. (I know, Madam,
you like I should be particular). I suppofe, Madam,
said Sir George, Mrs. Arnold has sent you for her
<HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>obedient</HI> daughter; he laid a great stress
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
upon those two last words. I am come for Miss
Cecilia, Sir, said I, if she has your's and my lady's
permission to return. Lady Sarah only said Umph!
in her scornful manner, though still without taking
her eyes off the glass. I am sorry, said Sir George,
that I ever had any thing to do with her, she has
vexed me heartily; but it shall be the better for <HI>you,</HI>
Dolly. Is Miss at home, Sir? said I. You may
suppose, answered lady Sarah, that we should hardly
suffer a young lady so wilful as she is, to have the
liberty of going abroad without some of us with
her; for my part I would not take the charge of
her, for there is really no knowing—She
stopped there; I was very much concerned, on hear∣ing
that Miss Cecilia was in the house, not to find
her in company with her sister and the rest of the
family, and was afraid they did not admit her into
their presence. May I be allowed to see her,
Madam? said I; for as I have directions to carry
her out of town to-morrow, I believe Miss would
like to be apprized of it as long before as possible.
Oh, answered Sir George, for that matter you may
assure yourself she is in readiness; however, if you
chuse it, Mrs. Askham, you may go up stairs to
her; I fancy you will find her in her own chamber.
Be sure now don't be <HI>severe</HI> on the poor child, nor
repeat any of the <HI>harsh</HI> things her <HI>mother</HI> says on
this occasion. Sir George spoke this in his biting,
ironical way; but I would not seem to understand
him; and rising up, I believe, Sir, said I, she will
find her mama very angry with her; though I shall
not take the liberty of saying any thing on the
subject. Miss Arnold rose at the same time, with a
design, I believe, of shewing me to her sister's cham∣ber;
but Sir George stopped her, Where now,
Dolly? said he; Mrs. Askham and your sister may
have secrets; pray, my dear, don't interrupt them.
Miss Arnold sat down again immediately; Upon my
life, said Sir George, if you were not the best girl in
the world, that little vixen would be enough to spoil
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
you. At the same time he bid my lady's woman
wait on me to Miss Cecilia's chamber.</P>
<P>I found the dear creature by herself, very busy in
packing up some of her little nicer things in band∣boxes
for the expected journey. She sprung to me
the moment I entered the room, and throwing her
arms round my neck, after having enquired about her
mama's health and that of Mr. Price, When are we
to go out of town? said she. To-morrow, my dear,
answered I, (for as I had not at that time called on
my brother, I knew not that I should be delayed).
Thank God! thank God! answered she, I hope my
mama is not <HI>very</HI> much displeased with me? My dear
Madam, you can't suppose she is much satisfied with
your behaviour; but I am not commissioned to say
any thing on this head from her. I had rather you
<HI>were,</HI> answered she, and that my mama had sent me
a great scolding by you, for I dread the mild correc∣tion
of <HI>her</HI> eye more than all my uncle's violence,
and lady Sarah's ill-nature. I wise, continued she,
poor Dolly were going out of town along with me;
for I am sure she as little likes staying here as I do,
only she has not spirit enough to say so. I hope, my
dear, said I, you won't put it into her head to desire
it, for that would be making an entire breach be∣tween
your mama and Sir George! By no means,
answered she, smiling; he intends to make my sister
his heir, if she does not disoblige him as I have done.
I would not for the world interpose; but besides, it
is not in my power, for do you know that for this
week past they won't let my sister converse with me,
for fear, as my uncle says, of my perverting her?
Bless me, Miss Cecilia, cried I, is it possible that
things have gone so far? Oh yes, said she, you see I
am grown a sad girl since I left Oxfordshire, and all
this because I won't marry a man I don't like! As I
resolved not to enter on that topic with her, I replied,
But how can you be deprived of your sister's conver∣sation;
I thought you had slept together? No, an∣swered
she, we always have had separate apartments
here as well as at home; but we used, notwithstand∣ing,
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
to have our hours for little private chat; but
now, we never speak but in the presence of my uncle
and aunt, which confines our conversation to meal
time; for I take as little of their company as I can,
and my poor sister is always pinn'd to lady Sarah's
sleeve: 'Tis a dreadful life, added she, sighing; do
they think to bend my mind to their purpose by such
severity? No, no, Mrs. Askham, my heart revolts
against such tyranny; yet I am glad they have made
use of it, because—Because what, my dear? Because
I shall return with double satisfaction to a
parent from whose tenderness I have every thing to
hope.</P>
<P>I made no reply to Miss Cicilia; but here, will
you forgive me, my ever respected and dearest ma∣dam,
if I take the liberty to say that I am afraid our
young lady's reliance on the mildness of your disposi∣tion,
has encouraged her to stand out so positively
against the will or her friends. Perhaps, Madam, if
you were a little less indulgent, Miss might be more
tractable. She likes not to be controuled; and, I
can't help saying, that I believe Sir George has been
rather too strict with her. She flies from him to
you; possibly if your countenance were to be a little
changed towards her, she would fly from you to lord
V—, who she knows idolizes her, and who to be
sure would be a noble and happy match for her.
Excuse me, Madam, for thus hinting my thoughts;
but as you have sometimes condescended to ask my
opinion, and even to take my advice, I hope you
will pardon me.</P>
<P>I did not think it proper to stay any longer with
Miss; but telling her I should be ready to attend her
the next day, I went down stairs again to know at
what hour Sir George should think it convenient for
me to call for her. He told me, at what hour I
pleased. I said, At eight o'clock in the morning;
Sir George replied carelesly, With all my heart.
Poor Miss. Arnold looked wistfully at me, as if she
were desirous that I should not go away so soon; for
I had not sate down when I returned again into lady
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
Sarah's room. Sir George observed it; Come, said
he, to Miss, I know you long to have a little con∣versation
with your old friend: lady Sarah, do you
dine at home? You will excuse my observation here,
Madam; but I thought Sir George gave this hint to
my lady, in order to put her in mind of asking me to
dinner, though he would not venture himself to in∣vite
a person whom my lady remembered to have been
his sister's servant; but I shall always be proud of
the title, and so I should be, even if I had not owed
to you, Madam, the prosperity I now enjoy. My
lady replied, Yes sure, Sir George, we bave company
you know. Miss Arnold then took courage to say,
Mrs. Askham, can you oblige me with your company,
this afternoon? for I have scarce had time to enquire
after my mama, and I should be glad to ask after all
our neighbours in the country. I hardly knew what
answer to make; for though I wished as much as my
dear Miss to see her again, yet I did not know whe∣ther
my visit would be agreeable to lady. Sarah; but
before I had time to reply, her ladyship said, Do
come if you can, Mrs. Askham, I am sure my niece
will be glad to see you. I told Miss Arnold I would
wait on her, and took my leave.</P>
<P>Having found my brother's family in the distress
I have already mentioned, I thought it still more neces∣sary
to go, in order to tell Miss Cecilia that her jour∣ney
must be deferred for a day or two; accordingly
about five o'clock I went to Sir George's; I enquired
for Miss Arnold; the servant said she had not yet left
the parlour where they dined; but that Miss Cecilia
was gone up to her own chamber; and if I pleased
he would call her to me. I desired he would do so;
and she presently flew down to me. I am sorry, said I,
Madam, to see you absent yourself thus from your
friends, especially as you are so soon to leave them. I
do not like to be brow-beaten, replied she; formerly
every thing I said and did was admired; but times
are sadly altered with poor Cecilia; besides, I do not
like the company they have with them, they are for∣mal
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
old people, and I was glad to slip away. I have
received a letter to-day from my lord V—, added she,
all in the some breath, a very decen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one it is; the
man seems to have some sense and some delicacy; I
hate him for it, because it will make me appear the
more inexcusable. I wish I could like him, but—
I am a perverse sool, and there's an end on't. She
then gave me the letter to read, telling me at the same
time that my lord V—had not been to visit Sir George
for two or three days past, which her uncle and aunt
laying to her account, had teized her to death on the
occasion. After I had read the letter, having told
Miss that I could not possibly leave town the next
day, (at which she seemed sadly vexed) I informed
her I should write to you, to let you know the cause
of our delay, and that I should be very glad if she
would allow me to inclose to you, my lord's letter.
Dear Mrs. Askham, said she, how can you desire such
a thing? I have not shewn it to a mortal but yourself,
and would not have my mama see it for the world. I
should appear so giddy, so obstinate, so unaccounta∣ble!
I am sorry then, Madam, said I, that you have
shewn it to me, for I shall certainly think it my duty
to acquaint your mama with every thing I know con∣cerning
you, therefore you may as well let her have
the letter, for I shall assuredly give her the contents of
it. Well, put it in your pocket then, said she, with
some displeasure in her looks, and don't let any one
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e see it; for we just then heard Miss Arnold at the
door, who, having enquired if I was come, ran to
receive me. She asked me over and over again after
her dear mama, then enquired for all her friends in the
country, one by one, and demanded when you had
heard from Mr. Falkland, whom she said she had not
seen since the night that some little dispute had hap∣pened
between him and Sir George. Both the ladies
expressed themselves much concerned at this affair,
and said they hoped it had not given you any ill im∣pression
of Mr. Falkland, as you knew Sir George had
never been well inclined towards him.</P>
<P>I think poor Miss Arnold does not look very well;
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
she is rather thinner than she was, and her spirits seem
but low, which I attribute chiefly to the thoughts of
parting with her sister. I hope, however, Mrs. B—'s
fears for her health have less grounds than she appre∣hends;
for Miss herself says that if she were to return
to the country to her former quiet life, she is sure she
should be perfectly well. I believe so too, yet as I
am certain your recalling her would highly disoblige
Sir George, with whom she is a very great favourite,
I believe, Madam, you will think it adviseable to
let her stay in town at least till the latter end of
spring.</P>
<P>I here inclose my lord V—'s letter, which as I
thought it would be acceptable, I would not defer
the shewing it to you till Miss Cecilia's return, though
I am in hopes that will not be retarded above a day
or two.</P>

<DATELINE>Grosvenor-square, <DATE>Feb. 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Do not give the name of an apology to the rea∣sons
I am going to offer for having taken the re∣solution
of absenting myself from you. An excuse
implies, at least, a <HI>supposed</HI> offence; but where there
is an utter indifference on one side, assiduity or inat∣tention
on the other, must pass equally unregarded
and unobserved, and an apology must consequently
appear impertinent. Yet, madam, if in your disen∣gaged
moments you should casually bestow a thought
on me, I must beseech you not to imagine that I can
either resent or blame your coldness towards me,
or that I can ever cease to admire and respect you;
and while I lament my misfortune in not having been
able to gain your affection, I would fain flatter my∣self
that this has not proceeded so much from aver∣sion,
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
as from a sentiment of delicacy. Conscious beau∣ty
and worth are ever tenacious of their own privi∣leges,
and should not be approached by the ordinary
avenues. I ought to have considered that as my hap∣piness
depended only on you, I should, at least, have
tried to obtain an assurance from yourself, that your
heart was not intirely averse to me, before I ven∣tured
to expose you to the solicitations of your friends
in my favour. I acknowledge my error, madam, and
ask your pardon for it; yet it was an error into
which I was led by the partiality, of Sir George
Bidulph and my lady V—, who gave birth to
my secret wishes almost as soon as I had conceived
them, and flattered me with certainty before I durst
flatter myself with hope. But though I have been
sufficiently punished for my presumption, I think I
owe you a reparation for the trouble. I have given
you. I am highly bound to Sir George for the zeal
with which he has endeavoured to serve me; but as
I cannot bear to see you, for whom I would sacrifice
my life, made uneasy, I know of no way to rid you of
the importunity of your friends on my account, than
that of remitting my unacceptable addresses. Yet
do not think, madam, I am so temperate a lover as in∣tirely
to yield up all pretensions to your favour: if
your heart is not already engaged, I will dispute it
with any future pretender; but I will owe it to no
one but yourself. Sir George Bidulph mentioned to
me a design you had of returning into the country:
if it be to avoid me, madam, let me conjure you not
to deprive your friends of the pleasure they enjoy in
your society, nor yourself of any satisfaction you can
receive in theirs. My happiness is too immaterial to
be put in the balance with yours; and I promise you,
whatever it may cost me, that I will not enter Sir
George Bidulph's house whilst you continue there,
unless I have expressly your permission to do so; and
with regard to Sir George himself, as good-breeding
must oblige me to excuse this part of my conduct to∣wards
him, I shall do it in such a manner as not to
leave you open to the slightest reproach. Time and
your own generosity, madam, are the only advocates
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
on which I shall henceforth rely; if Mrs. Arnold
would be so good as to second their operations, I
should not despair of success. I know her character
too well to fear your suffering any thing from the ri∣gour
of authority; and should my heart impel
me to carry my vows down to Oxfordshire, tho' I
should still be wretched enough to have them rejected,
I should not have the additional grief of seeing you
persecuted for what cannot be attributed to you as a
fault.</P>

<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Feb. 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DOLLY, my dear Dolly, do not be angry with
your sister for leaving you. Angry, did I say?
No, that I am sure, you cannot be I never saw your
face clouded with a frown since I was born; let me
then rather beg of you not to be grieved at my absence.
Indeed, my dear, if I could have supported the ve∣ry
uneasy life I led in town, I would, for your sake,
have endeavoured to have submitted to it. But you
know it was impossible; besieged daily by the impor∣tunities
of a man whom I could not bring myself to
like, at the same time that I was conscious of his
worth; urged to a painful degree by the friends I so
much respect; and reproached with ingratitude and
disobedience, at the time when my heart was filled with
acknowledgment and duty. My dear, it is a misera∣ble
situation for a girl, who is not a fool, to have no∣thing
but <HI>will</HI> to oppose to <HI>reason,</HI> and that was the
situation of your poor sister; for now he is out of
my sight, I am ready to allow that my lord V—deserves
a much better wife than Cecilia: I would, to heaven
he had one to morrow a thousand times richer, hand∣somer,
wiser, better: and now, I think, I am out of
his debt; for he never wished me any husband but
himself.</P>
<P>Well, but now I must tell you, that though I am
rejoiced to find myself at home, I am very far from
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
being as happy as I used to be. My mama, Oh, sister,
my mama is intirely in my lord V—'s interests,
and condemns me exceedingly; Mr. Price does the
same: good old man! I love him, though he chides
me from morning to night. Mis. Askham, who is
of the cabinet council here, has taken up the same
tone, and I am tossed like a shuttle-cock from one to
t'other; but then they do not give me such hard
blows as my uncle and lady Sarah used to do; besides
I have longer recesses; for I make frequent escapes
into the garden, and tho' the weather is not very in∣viting,
the gravel-path in the wood is always dry.—
Ah, Dolly, I would sain tell you something; but the
time is not yet arrived, perhaps it may—Yet, if I
have any skill in the stars, it will not be long before I
shall unveil my mystery.</P>
<P>As I hate to be confined in <HI>any</HI> thing;, so do I par∣ticularly
hate to be confined in my writing; therefore,
if you have a mind to give my rambling imagination
full play (which, for your own entertainment, you
ought to desire) you must allow me to direct to you
under cover to Mr. Main, whose scrupulous exactness
I presume, will not object to the conveying a letter
privately from one sister to another; for if my uncle
is to inspect all my letters, you will never get any thing
more from me than four stiff-lines written in my best
hand, such as schoolmasters receive once a year from
the children they teach to write; in which they beg
pardon for past faults, and promise amendment for
the time to come.</P>
<P>I have begun by sending this to Main, with a
charge to give it into your own hands; and this same
post brings a fine flourishing letter of thanks to lady
Sarah for all civilities to me. I had as lief have let
it alone, but my mama insisted on it; and to say the
truth, lady Sarah was kind enough to me at first,
and, I believe, would have continued so, if lord
V—had not unluckily thrust in his nose to disturb
our union. Do you know that my mama has written
to him, and hinted that she would be glad to see him
here? 'Tis very true, I assure you; she shewed me a
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
copy of her letter. If he should come down, let
them beware of driving me to extremities.—From
whom do I inherit this stubborn spirit of mine? I do
not remember my papa, but I have often heard he was
a mild-tempered man; and for my mother, has she
not been a prodigy of suffering patience! Ah, Dolly,
why am not <HI>I</HI> more like her?—Adieu, dear, dear
Dolly.</P>

<OPENER>Extract of Miss ARNOLD'S Answer to the foregoing.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>—Lady Sarah received your letter in good
part, as you know she loves to have civil things said
to her; but my uncle called you a little hypocrite.</P>
<P>Lord V—was here the other day; he told us
he had been indisposed for some days past, which
prevented our seeing him. He expressed himself
much concerned for having been the occasion of
driving you from town; blamed himself for having
been too precipitate in urging his suit, till a longer
proof of his affection had a little better intitled him
to sollicit your favour. He said he had received a
very obliging letter from my mama, which had given
him new life, as she had assured him in it of her
warmest concurrence in promoting his wishes; he
added, that with this encouragement he purposed
renewing his attack in Oxfordshire; but that he
would first give Miss Cecilia time to recover herself
from the fatigue she had undergone in town from his
importunities. My uncle seems much pleased with
this step of my mama's; for I believe he was afraid,
my lord would intirely have given up. the pursuit.
He said, (speaking of you) after his lordship was
gone, That girl is the veriest little tyrant in nature;
she has different ways of subjecting every one. to her
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
will; she awes lord V—with her faecy looks,
and subdues her mother with her sly caresses. <HI>I</HI> am
the only person who can deal with her. My sister
<HI>pretends,</HI> added he, to be angry with her; but we
shall see whether she has resolution enough to exert
a proper authority on this occasion; for I am deter∣mined
to be at Woodberry at the same time that my
lord V—is there, or I am sure his journey will
be to very little purpose. How I tremble for you,
my poor Cecilia! Yet indeed, my dear, I think my
lord V—worthy of you, if you were even more
amiable than you are. He is an admirable man; he
has every thing in his favour; every heart loves
him, but that perverse one for which he sighs; but
perhaps my Cecilia has not one to bestow on him.
Ah, my dear, there is a secret locked up in that
little close bosom of yours, that you would fain let
out; give it vent, my love; I promise you to keep
it inviolably, if you require it of me. If you have
given your affections to a deserving object, I. pray hea∣ven
you may meet with a return: for would it not be
a dreadful thing to love without being, beloved again?
yet still more dreadful to lose the heart you think you
have a right to possess! I don't know why these melan∣choly
thoughts have occurred to me; but my spirits
are exceedingly depressed. Mr. Falkland, I hear,
went out of town to-day. I am glad he is returned to
Oxford, and wish he had never seen London. I am
afraid he has been too much dissipated here; but he
is good, and will recollect himself: tell him I say so.
Mr. Main has promised to deliver all your letters
carefully to me; therefore do not restrain your
pen.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Feb. 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TELL me, Sir Edward, is it the tenure by
which man holds his scanty pittance of happi∣ness,
to pay with remorse every pleasure that he
tastes? What a day of exultation, of rapture, has
this been to me! such as thou, in thy wild excesses,
couldst never have an idea of. But when I have told
you the cause, you must assure me, nay, you must
swear to me, that I am honest; for spight of my tran∣sports,
something knocks at my breast, and whispers,
“Falkland, thou art a traitor!” Busy spright, thou
liest; dare not to interrupt my joy with thy cursed
croaking.</P>
<P>Having stopped to make a visit on my way hither,
I arrived here late last night, and set out this morning
about ten o'clock, to pay my respects at Woodberry.
Mrs. Arnold and Mr. Price, I was told at the gate,
were gone to assist at the wedding of two of their
friends, who lived about a mile off, and were not ex∣pected
home till evening. Mr. Price, it seems, was to
marry them; and Mrs. Arnold, who had bestowed a
fortune on the young girl, was to give her away. I
enquired for Miss Cecilia, and was answered that she
was at home. I entered the doors with a palpitation
of heart. She flew down stairs to meet me; my arms
involuntarily clasped her. My dearest Cecilia! Dear
Orlando, how I rejoice to see you here again! We
entered the parlour together. How beautiful she ap∣peared
to me! I thought there was a tenderness
mixed with pleasure in her looks, that I had never
observed before.</P>
<P>After forty inquiries, on her side, relative to the
Audley family, and as many on mine with regard to
her own, we both, for some time, remained silent,
each looking as if they wished the other would speak.
At length, How comes it, said she, that you have
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
left London so soon? Because, said I, there was no∣thing
there that had any charms to retain me. Then
you have brought back your heart, she replied, with
a look that fascinated me.—Ah, Cecilia, I brought
it not thither! This answer escaped me; I knew not
what I said; yet my words were accompanied with
such an expression of countenance as required not an
explanation; a deep vermillion covered her white
skin, even to her neck—She was silent for a little
while, then assuming an air of sober command,
Falkland, said she, tell me <HI>truly,</HI> have you bestowed
your affections? An important reason makes it neces∣sary
that you answer me with sincerity.</P>
<P>What a temptation was this, Audley, to be a vil∣lain!
Dazzled as I was with hope, my head was
almost giddy. I seized her hand, and pressing it to
my lips, Yes, cried I, I <HI>do</HI> love; you have a right
to know the secrets of my heart; a heart that was
your <HI>own</HI> before I knew I had one to give! I am sa∣tisfied,
said she, restraint and dissimulation are at an end.
I wanted but this assurance; and now I will give my
reason why I refuse my lord V—. What a noble
frankness was here! how unlike a <HI>woman!</HI> no af∣fected
confusion, no pretty coyness, after such a de∣claration!
Amazed, overwhelmed, and penetrated to
the soul, I fell at her feet, and grasping her knees
with the action of a madman, Oh, Cecilia, cried I,
dare I believe my senses? Is it possible that the poor
ill-fated wretch you see before you, the neglected,
the despised Falkland, should be the object of my
Cecilia's secret love: Oh, could I have divined what
passed in your heart!—And here, Audley,
recollecting myself at once, I was upon the point of
declaring—but fear, or love, or falshood, call it
what you will, checked my tongue.—I always
thought you loved me, said she; yet, Falkland, you
should have spoke first, and spared me the pain of
extorting a confession from you; had you made it
sooner, it might have saved me from the difficulties
with which I am now embarrassed. And from what
would it have saved <HI>me?</HI> whispered I to myself, and
muttering an imprecation, on thy head, Audley.
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
Taught from my infancy, replied I, to look upon
you as something sacred, I never dared to let a sigh
transpire before you. 'Twas that, said she, that
modest diffidence, that distrust of your own worth,
that won me, and long since determined me in your
favour; and if I have till now concealed my senti∣ments
for you from all the world, 'twas from an im∣pulse
of pride; or perhaps I should give it a contrary
name, and call it humility. I knew not whether a
youthful inclination (however lively) without encour∣agement,
without even hope, would not be extin∣guished
by absence, or perhaps turned to another ob∣ject;
but since I find I am still beloved, what reason
have I to hide an honest and well-grounded affection?
Orlando, added she, collecting her sweet features
into a grave and even solemn look, I have as little
levity and as much true honour in my soul as any of
my sex; but I will not be a slave to false delicacy,
nor sacrifice my own happiness to the vanity of my
proud relations. Do you know, pursued she, with
her usual quickness, that my uncle and my lord V—
are coming down hither? I will throw myself at my
mama's feet, you shall do the same; I know she loves
you. If we obtain her consent, I shall give myself
but little pain about the displeasure of the rest of my
family. Trembling with apprehension at what I
heard her say, my thoughts were all confusion—
'Twas now too late to make the hateful confession—
I hung down my head, without being able to answer
her. Are you afraid, said she, to acknowledge the
truth to my mama? This question suggested a reply.
I <HI>am,</HI> said I. Mrs. Arnold will not, I <HI>know</HI> she will
not consent to my happiness; and a mother's <HI>prohibi∣tion</HI>
deprives me, for ever, of my Cecilia. I cannot
consent to risque my life (for no less is at stake) upon
the fiat of Mrs. Arnold's lips. Her tenderness for
you may lead her to forgive a step, when irrecovera∣bly
taken, to which she dare not yield her assent be∣fore-hand.
Mrs. Arnold lives not to herself, she has
ever been a slave to the capricious will of others.
True, replied Cecilia; yet I think she <HI>might</HI> be pre∣vailed
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
on. Oh, never, never, said I. Has she not
as good as given her promise to lord V—? invited
his visits down hither? Your uncle Bidulph comes
with him, to arm his sister's heart, by his own exam∣ple,
with severity against her child. <HI>I</HI> am banished
your presence, forbid even to think of you, insulted
perhaps by the man against whom, for your sake, I
would not lift my arm; you exposed to the re∣proaches
of your family, and probably to new perse∣cutions,
and all this without resource.—Ah, my
Cecilia, what consolation would it be to a wretched
lover to think, that for his sake, his beloved devoted
her youth to a single life, and suffered thus for her
virtuous constancy? I had seized her hand while I
spoke. She snatched it from me, to dash off a tear
that started into her eye. If my uncle and my lord
V—come down hither, said she, and my persecu∣tion
is again renewed, Falkland, I am afraid, I am
afraid I shall o'erleap the bounds of duty; for force
will make me desperate. Call it not desper∣ation,
said I, to fly for shelter to the man that wor∣ships
you. Our hands once joined, who can untie
the knot? Let me only conjure you, for the present,
to keep your secret with the same caution that you
have hitherto done. Our mutual affection once
known, the consequence would be an eternal separa∣tion.
Let us then conceal it, till it will not be in
human power to disjoin us. Though I will never
submit, replied she, to have a choice forced on me,
yet should I be very unwilling to marry without my
mama's approbation; against her <HI>express command I</HI>
certainly never would. There is but this alternative
then, cried I; either to banish me from your thoughts
for ever, or <HI>venture</HI> to make me happy, without
hazarding an express command to the contrary; for
such be assured, my Cecilia, you would receive from
your mama, who, bigotted to the tyranny of duty,
would think herself bound, on this occasion, to act
conformably to the desires of her family, though her
own heart, perhaps, would dictate to her much
milder measures. Hear my resolution, Falkland,
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
said she, laying her hand on mine. My mother's
repose is as dear to me as my own. If I can avoid
this match with lord V—, I will wait patiently till
the resentment of my friends is a little subsided, when
I am determined at all events, to open my heart to
my mama, and I think she will not sacrifice her
daughter's peace of mind to an idle prejudice. But
if, on the contrary, I am to be <HI>compelled</HI> to marry
(for my uncle, I can tell you, is capable of going
such lengths) this hand, without farther considera∣tion,
is yours.—Think you not, Audley, that I
kissed a hundred times that beautiful hand, the
pledge of my future felicity?</P>
<P>Would to heaven my lord V—and Sir George
Bidulph would come immediately down to Wood∣berry,
that my little chased fawn might fly for refuge
to my arms! She has hitherto kept her own counsel;
I have conjured her to do so still. Her sister is too
timid to venture on divulging <HI>her</HI> secret, unless it
were to prevent what she will not know till it is too
late for prevention; and then to what purpose disturb
a peaceful union by a useless discovery? Have I then
any reason to dread consequences? I would fain be
happy; yet there is something which will not let me,
something that tells me I have done <HI>wrong.</HI> Yet
how? which way? I have made some slight promises
to another, extorted from me in a thoughtless hour
of spleen and disappointment. What is there in that?
Would it not be a greater crime to fulfil than to
break those promises? In one case, I bind an unhap∣py
girl for ever to a man that cannot love her, and
therefore does not deserve her; in the other, I cost
her a few tears, perhaps, make her fret for a month
or so; she calls me perfidious, dismisses me from her
heart, and there's an end on't. Prithee, Audley, is
not this the fair way of stating the account?</P>
<P>'Tis very late, so I'll e'en to bed, and dream, if I
can, of my beloved.—</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170"/>
Friday morning.</P>
<P>I broke off here last night, and threw myself into
bed in hopes of enjoying over again in sleep the plea∣sures
of the preceding day; but so such thing; I
have had a wretched night, and have now started up
again at five o'clock in the morning, and struck a
light, for I cannot rest. Oh, may my Cecilia's slum∣bers
be softer! I said I would dream of her, and so
I did; but it was some demon, not the god of Love,
who presided over my visions.—I know you will laugh
at me, yet I am exceedingly shocked, and long for
day-light, that I may go out and shake the folly off.</P>
<P>Write to me, Sir Edward, encourage me, rouze
me, or, spight of my efforts, I shall droop again before
I reach my promised goal of happiness.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 1st.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OUT upon thee for a visionary coxcomb! why
thou wilt dwindle into a mere old woman at
last. Thou art frighted with a dream! the scarecrows
of thy own sickly imagination pursue thee in thy
sleep, and thou very manfully criest out for help,
<HI>rouze me, encourage me!</HI> Oh, thou chicken-hearted
Falkland, must thou be spurred on in the road to
happiness? Is there not a green sward all the way
before thee? not a single impediment but what thy
own folly creates! Why, under what a triumphant
star wert thou born! Oh, the sweet shepherd of Ida
that holds commerce only with divinities! Whilst
poor I must be content with grizettes. Well, I envy
you not your success with Cecilia; <HI>I</HI> but fooled with
her, for I do really love her sister, and would not
have yielded her to any one but yourself. Things
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
are now in the right channel again; you have se∣cured
<HI>your</HI> love, help me to do the same by <HI>mine,</HI> and
I will allow thou <HI>art</HI> a man.</P>
<P>I am entirely of your own opinion that it would
be downright cruelty to keep a poor girl to a silly
promise, as she herself declared to my sister that she
did not know what she was doing when she made it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and of which, spight of her affection to you, she has
a hundred times repented since. Sophy, who you
know is much in her confidence, has told me that
Miss Arnold had often declared to her she would give
the world to recall the hasty step she had taken; Not.
added she, but I love Falkland, and would prefer
him to all mankind; but then the disobedience of the
act! the grief it would be to my mama, the resent∣ment
I shall draw on myself from all my family! I
cannot bear the thoughts of it. Then would she
burst into tears, and wish she had never known you.
Why, what a phlegmatic love is this, Falkland! How
unlike the aetherial fire of thy Cecilia! I do verily be∣lieve,
and I speak to you now without either raillery
or prejudice, that after the first shock which her pride
might receive at finding herself deserted, she would
at the bottom of her heart be glad that she was ab∣solved
from a promise which terrifies her every time
she thinks of it; and which, you may take it on my
word, you would find it almost impracticable to make
her fulfil. She would do mighty well to be the
mistress of a Don Bellianis, or a Sir Launcelot, who
could afford to waste seven years in strolling up and
down the world, without either meat or drink, in
order to prove his constancy; and after that would
think himself fully paid, if he were allowed to brush
his beard (which he had vowed never to shave till he
saw her again) on her lilly white hand through the
grated window of some inchanted tower. She would
suit to a hair, I say, a fellow who would be content
thus to love in buskins; but for us modern gallants,
who have not so much time to throw away on sighing,
give me a girl who has spirit enough to spring out of
a window into our arms; such a girl as Cecilia, who,
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
above disguise, avows her love, and spite of the stern
brow of parental authority, bestows her person and
her fortune where she has given her heart. As for
Dolly, 'tis such a frigid soul that I am amazed how a
spark could be kindled in such an ice-house as her
bosom; much puffing and blowing must it have cost
the little damon Love to light the flame, and after all
'tis but a sickly blaze, you see, which like a dying
lamp pops up and down, whilst Duty waits with his
extinguisher in his hand, to slop down on it the first
moment he catches the little urchin napping.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, Falkland, this fearful girl would
never have courage enough to fulfil her engagement,
till after she had made you serve as long an appren∣ticeship
as old father what's-his-name did for his wife.
Things indeed were better managed in those days than
they are at present; for a man was then at liberty to
marry two sisters, which was the case of the afore∣said
patriarch; and if one could do so still, the affair
might be made very easy; for you might take Cecilia
how, and I'll engage Dolly would keep cold very well
for about fourteen years.</P>
<P>After all, Falkland, I think the best thing you can
do, is to make over to me your <HI>imaginary</HI> right (for
a real one you have not) in this girl. I'll take her
with all my soul, and shall not think the worse of her,
for her having formerly liked a handsomer fellow than
myself. I'll trust to her religion to keep her faithful
to me, once I am vested with the awful name of
husband. By the way, those prejudices are not
without their use amongst the women, they often
keep the poor things out of mischief when nothing
else would. Give it me therefore in black and white
(that we may have no after-reckonings) that you
yield up ail pretensions to Dorothea Arnold, and I'll
take her off your hands.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph goes down to Woodberry.—Good!
matters must then be soon brought to a crisis.
His peevish wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is not so vigilant as himself; and if
I knew the day, the hour, the minute that united
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
you to Cecilia; on that same day, hour, and minute,
would I possess myself of the elder hope of the fa∣mily.
I have conceived my plan; but 'tis your hand,
Falkland, must help me to execute it; and when our
uncle Bidulph has turned his back, you shall hear
from me to some purpose.</P>

<P>MY good genius is at work for me; blessings
on lord V—for taking the resolution of
coming down to Woodberry! he arrived there yester∣day;
little did the fool imagine chat he was coming
on the spur to the destruction of his own hopes.
What a <HI>gracious</HI> reception did he meet with from
Mrs. Arnold! What a delightfully cold one from
my adoreable! Things are, I hope, as you say,
drawing to a crisis; but this lord V—is too tempe∣rate,
and the elements too equally mixed in his com∣position;
his breath alone is not sufficient to raise
the storm that is to drive my Cecilia from the harbour
of her mother's arms; his sighs like gentle breezes
do but list, and give a livelier motion to the waves,
'Tis Sir George Bidulph, who like the boisterous north
wind, will blow a storm, work all into foam about
him, and force ray little pinnace from her moorings.
Would he were come! But what can his absence
from London do for <HI>you?</HI> Do you think it will make
your access to Miss Arnold less difficult? Be assured,
Audley, I do most sincerely wish her your's, and do
hereby renounce all right and title to her. I am
certain that you would make her a much better
husband than I should, and therefore shall be ready
to concur with you in any measures to obtain her;
but to tell you the truth, the thing appears so im∣practicable
to me, that till I know your plan, I must
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
consider your hopes as almost desperate, and cannot
help being sorry for you in the midst of the tide of
joy that flows in upon my heart.</P>
<P>As for my own part, I begin to be quite recon∣ciled
to myself; and if my solitary hours are some∣times
clouded with a little remorse, the rays of my
Cecilia's eyes disperse it as sun-shine does a vapour.</P>

<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Wish, my dear, I could give you a satisfactory an∣swer
to your enquiries; but I really now think
matters wear a much worse face than ever they did.
You know I already told you, that having urged
every thing I could in favour of my lord V—, I
thought it prudent to drop the subject for some time,
in hopes Cecilia's gratitude for such a condescension,
would have more weight with her when l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft to the
workings of her own heart, than all my brother's
boisterous proceedings, joined to the teizing of lady
Sarah, which my daughter declared had only served
to heighten her dislike to lord V—, who had been the
innocent cause of the uneasiness she was made to suf∣fer.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="177"/>
Things were in this suspended situation, when I re∣ceived
a polite letter from my lord V—, begging my
permission to pay me a visit. It was accompanied with
another for Cecilia, full of tenderness and respect;
but without any of the impatient flights of a lover.
Cecilia said upon reading it, I wish my lord V—would
allow me to enjoy myself in quiet; he knows I quit∣ted
London to avoid him, why will he pursue me down
hither? I was offended at the peevish manner in
which she spoke, and told her she must not presume
on my indulgence, to treat with contempt, or even
indifference, the man I so much respected, and to
whose family I had such strong obligations. She
seemed abashed at my rebuke, and said she should al∣ways
behave to lord V—with that deference and
esteem which she thought due to him. I answered his
lordship's letter directly, which he had sent express;
and the next evening I had the pleasure to receive him
in person. With what satisfaction did I embrace the
amiable son of my dear lady V—, and of her worthy
lord! I had not the least recollection of his features,
for it is thirteen years since I have seen him. His no∣ble
stature, and military air, give a dignity to his per∣son
that recommends him at first sight; and I could
not help giving a look of astonishment at Cecilia, who
was in the room with me when he entered. She re∣ceived
him with great civility; but a coldness which
seemed to mortify him. My son Falkland happened
to be with us; my lord politely saluted, but spoke not
to him. Orlando reddened like fire; I saw he had
not forgotten the resentment you formerly told me he
had conceived against him. I was vexed he happened
to be present, and should for the boy's sake have taken
care to have prevented this abrupt interview, if I had
thought my lord V—would have been so expeditious
in making his visit after the receipt of my letter.</P>
<P>I was desirous my son and he should be on more
sociable terms; I asked my lord if he did not think
Mr. Falkland had a strong resemblance to his father?
He replied, he had but an imperfect remembrance of
the elder Mr. Falkland's face, having seen him but a
<PB N="3" REF="178"/>
few times in his life; whence he took occasion to ad∣dress
my son, and asked him some questions relative
to the course of his studies; (my lord himself was
bred at the same university). Mr. Price had now
got upon his favourite topic, and entered with viva∣city
into the convention. In the course of which,
he took occasion to mention his pupil's design of go∣ing
into the army. My lord V—highly commended
his choice. Orlando received his civilities with cold∣ness,
and very soon took his leave. After he was
gone, his lordship told me, he should very soon have
a cornetcy vacant in his regiment, as the officer who
now had the post, had, on account of very ill health,
desired leave to quit the army, and meant to return to
England as soon as he was able to endure the fatigue
of the journey. 'Tis at Mr. Falkland's service, added
he, and I should have offered it to the young gentle∣man
himself, had you, Madam, delivered your senti∣ments
with regard to the course of life of which he
has made choice; but if you approve of it, I shall
think myself happy in his acceptance of this mark of
my respect for him. I acknowledged, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
this instance of his lordship's goodness and consi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tion
for a youth, who I told him had always been re∣garded
by me as a son. Mr. Price expressed himself
as warmly as if the favour had been conferred imme∣diately
on himself; and said he considered his young
friend as singularly happy in being under the patronage
and protection of lord V—</P>
<P>I indeed thought myself much obliged to his lord∣ship,
yet I know to whose account I ought in reality
to place this mark of his bounty: he thought to please
Cecilia by shewing such a distinction to her brother;
but she seemed not sensible of his intention, and her
behaviour was constrained for the rest of the evening.</P>
<P>You know I am an early riser, yet my lord V—
prevented me the next morning, for I found him in
the parlour when I came down stairs; neither Mr.
Price nor Cecilia were yet stirring.</P>
<P>After our first salutations, Well, my dear Madam,
said he, may I yet flatter myself with any thing like
<PB N="4" REF="179"/>
hope? I told him frankly, that I could not say he had
made the smallest progress in my daughter's affections;
expressing at the same time my surprize and my con∣cern,
and assuring him nothing could give me greater
pleasure than an alliance with his family. I am at
present, said he, under the most disagreeable dilemma
in the world; I came not down hither to importune
Miss Cecilia; the principal motive of my visit was to
pay my respects to you, and I meant not to remind your
daughter of my love by any other marks of it than
my submission and my assiduity to please.; but Sir
George Bidulph told me on the eve of my departure
from London, that he meant soon to follow me down
hither. Now as I am very much afraid that his in∣terfering
too warmly will rather destroy than promote
my interests, I ventured to hint this tenderly to Sir
George, insinuating at the same time that I should
have better hopes of succeeding, if he would permit
me to pursue my own method in endeavouring to gain
his niece's affections, who, I said, I thought had al∣ready
been too much urged. He laughed, and told
me, I did not know her, but I dare not repeat to you
all Sir George said on the occasion.</P>
<P>I answered his lordship, that I knew my brother's
manner, and therefore begged he would speak freely.
You must not then be angry, replied lord V—, but
these were Sir George's words; “Cecilia is vain, and
loves to be admired. She has had her little brain
turned with flattery, and fancies she ought not to
give up her power under a romantic courtship of se∣ven
years. Her mother” (remember, Madam, you
are not to be angry with me) “has spoiled her by too
great an indulgence; and an absurd old relation of
ours has made her still more untractable, by leaving
her a fortune in her own power. Though I have a
perfect good opinion of her, yet I think a girl thus
circumstanced, as she has it in her power, so she
may have it a <HI>little</HI> in her inclination to chuse for
herself, and who can answer for the choice of inex∣perienced
youth? I believe as yet her heart has re∣ceived
no impressions. She had three adorers whilst
<PB N="5" REF="180"/>
she was with me, besides your lordship; but she
shewed not the least liking to any of them; and her
sister, on whose word I am sure I can rely, declared
she believed her inclinations entirely disengagcd. 'Tis
upon this assurance, therefore, that I have been the
more peremptory with her, as I consider her de∣clining
your hand merely as the result of obstinacy
and caprice; and if we give way to her in this in∣stance,
relying perhaps on the fond partiality of her
friends, her next step may be to give us a relation,
who possibly may have no other merit, but what her
fancy discovers in him. Lady S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rah and myself, ad∣ded
Sir George, desire ardently to see her your's.
My sister and Miss Arnold both profess to do the
same; my lady V—'s sentiments, you know, agree
with ours, so do those of all our friends.—” I in∣terrupted
Sir George here; But if the sentiments of
the lady herself, said I, are averse to me, I am not a
lover so void of delicacy as to seize an unwilling hand,
joined to mine merely by the authority of parents.
Psha, cried Sir George, 'tis such lovers as you who
make the women so insolent; do you think it abso∣lutely
necessary that the lady whom you marry should
be as much in love with you as you are with her? I
told him, No; but that I thought it absolutely neces∣sary
that there should be at least no <HI>dislike</HI> on the part
of the lady. Sir George was here pleased to pay me
some unmerited compliments, and bid me at the same
time recollect that you, Madam, who had not only
married without inclination, but, as he believed, with
strong prepossessions in favour of another, had made
a most exemplary wife even in the most trying circum∣stances;
and he was convinced you had had as sincere
an affection for Mr. Arnold as if he had been the man
of your choice. I stopped my lord here, to assure
him that my brother had spoken the truth. All this I
own then, Madam, pursued he, has encouraged me
to persevere; but what at present distresses me is, that
I am apprehensive, when Sir George comes down to
Woodberry, he will be for pushing matters to an ex∣tremity;
for he declared, if his niece continued ob∣stinate,
<PB N="6" REF="181"/>
that he would renounce her! What shall we
do, dear Madam? added he, for I solemnly aver to
you, that passionately as I love Miss Cecilia Arnold,
I would desist from my pursuit sooner than draw on
her the resentment of her friends, if I thought that
would be a means of preserving her from it; but
matters have already gone so far, that even that would
be attributed to her by Sir George as a subject of com∣plaint
equal to a peremptory refusal on her side. I
told his lordship he had formed a very just conclusion,
as the blame must certainly light on Cecilia, let our
disappointment in this union wear what face it would:
I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of no means then to be pursued, added I,
bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffer my brother to be <HI>decisive</HI> on this occasion.
If <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daughter's reluctance does not amount to aver∣sion,
(which I have not the least reason to think it
does) she will certainly yield rather than forfeit her
uncle's regard; and, in that case, you may depend on
the goodness of her heart for a suitable return to your
tenderness. On the other hand, if her caprice is in∣surmountable,
I know she has spirit enough to be reso∣lute
in her refusal, let the consequences be what they
will. If this should be the issue, Madam, replied lord
V—, I must conjure you not to let Cecilia feel a <HI>mo∣ther</HI>'s
resentment, as well as that of her other rela∣tions;
remember the <HI>heart</HI> is not at our own disposal.—
How I admire the generosity of this worthy young no∣bleman!</P>
<P>I shall pass over the four or five intermediate days
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my brother's arrival, in all which time Orlando ne∣ver
came near us, though Mr. Price writ to him to let
him know my lord V—'s kind intentions towards him,
and recommended it to him to come and thank his
lordship. I am afraid this youth is of a proud and
vindictive spirit?</P>
<P>Lord V—all this while never entertained
Cecilia on the subject of his love. She seemed to
listen to him with pleasure on every other topic, and
the poor man appeared to me to be afraid of forfeiting
this satisfaction, by touching on the only string which
he knew would make discord.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="182"/>
Having had no previous notice of my brother's in∣tended
visit but what I received from lord V—,
who did not himself know the precise time of his com∣ing,
he came upon us a little abruptly last night just
as we were sitting down to supper. Cecilia turned
pale on his entering the room; and I thought Sir
George seemed at a loss what face to wear towards
her, as he had resolved to deport himself accordingly
as he should find her disposed towards lord V—</P>
<P>How amiable was my lord V—'s conduct on this
occasion! He affected an appearance of satisfaction,
which I knew he was very far from feeling at his heart;
he even assumed an ease in his behaviour towards his
mistress, which gave him the air of a lover who was
far from being discouraged.</P>
<P>Cecilia's uneasiness was too visible not to be observed
by my brother. He only waned till the servants were
withdrawn to ask her too roughly, I thought, whe∣ther
she still retained the same <HI>pretty inflexibility</HI> which
she had carried with her out of town? She made no
reply. Softly, my dear Sir George, said my lord, we
must not have our happiness disturbed by harsh inter∣rogations;
I never enjoyed so perfect a satisfaction as
I have done for these last five days. You then are
come to the use of your reason, niece, rejoined my
brother, looking at Cecilia with a sort of pleasure
mixed with distrust. I tell you again, said my lord,
smiling, we won't be interrogated; Miss Cecilia is all
goodness, all condescension. I am extremely glad to
hear it, cried my brother.—Sister! Mr. Price! what
say you? for a lover's word is not always to be de∣pended
on with regard to his mistress. Mr. Price was
silent, only by a little nod of his head indicated that
he had no great hopes of the business. I can't tell
how to answer you, brother, said I. Ha, I thought
so, cried my brother. Pray, my lord, to what may
Miss's <HI>condescension</HI> have amounted? To fit in the same
room with you, perhaps, or suffer you to take up her
glove if she happened to drop it? Cecilia sat biting her
lips, her looks full of vexation. Mr. Price began to
pat softly under the table with his foot, which is a ha∣bit
<PB N="8" REF="183"/>
he has given himself when he is discontented with
any thing. I have no reason to complain, Sir George,
said my lord V—, with that assured tone which hope
inspires. I'll be sacrificed, cried my brother, if you
have gained an inch of ground since you came down
hither! I flatter myselt I have lost none, answered
lord V—, and I am perfectly satisfied with my prospect
of happiness, however distant it may be. I honour
your lordship's patience extremely, said Sir George,
though it is a virtue of which I never had the good
fortune to be possessed. I have not the least objection,
continued he, to a man's going through all the cere∣monials
of a lover for a few months, provided he is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to be disappointed in the end; but (excuse
me, ladies) I would not sacrifice my time to any of
you, unless I had an absolute certainty of obtaining my
wishes; which I own, my lord, does not seem to be
your case. I am, nevertheless, satisfied to wait, Sir
George; the experiment is well worth the trial; and
I am resolved to be indebted to no one but the lady
herself for a happiness, which, from that circumstance,
would come with redoubled value. Mighty well, said
my brother, I see we are likely to advance wonder∣fully:
your lordship, however, must take your own
way. I thank you, Sir George, said my lord V—.
What news is there in London? This question gave
the conversation another turn, and we chatted on in∣different
things till my usual hour of retiring, when
my lord V—rose and wished us a good-night. Mr.
Price, who had, in complaisance to my brother, al∣ready
exceeded his customary hour of going to bed,
followed him immediately. Cecilia was now going to
withdraw, when my brother requested she would stay
a few minutes; she sat down again in her place. I
see, said he, from what has passed this evening, that
my lord V—. is just where he set out at first. I
was in hopes, Cecilia, that your mother's personal in∣fluence
would by this time have been able to subdue
that unpardonable obstinacy, which has already so
much disgusted all your friends; but as I find it has
had no effect, I shall desire no other favour of you than
<PB N="9" REF="184"/>
to answer me one plain question, which I wish to have
resolved as well for your own credit, as for the peace
of mind of my lord V—. He thinks you have
been too much pressed by your friends; perhaps you
think so too; and that you should have had more time
allowed you to cultivate such an esteem for him as
would voluntarily induce you to make him your choice.
He is willing to leave this desirable issue to time; tell
me truly, then, if your friends are satisfied to indulge
you in this, if you think you can then bring yourself
to accept of lord V—for a husband? Beware of
playing the coquet, child, (seeing she answered not
directly) my lord V—is not a man to fool with;
answer me without evasion; I have an opinion of your
frankness; if you require the foppery of a few months
dangling, why, be it so, I shall leave his lordship to
pursue his love-process according to his own me∣thod.
Cecilia, who had kept her eyes fixed on the
table whilst her uncle spoke, now raised them to his
face, You will not, I hope, Sir, said she, be offend∣ed
if I answer you with that sincerity you require
of me: I cannot think of lord V—for a hus∣band.
She withdrew her eyes again from Sir George's
face, in which I saw indignation beginning to kin∣dle
You prefer Sir Edward Audley, perhaps? Be∣lieve
me, Sir, I never entertained a thought of him.
—Mr. Hyndford possibly, or Mr. Gage? (you
know they were both her admirers) Indeed, Sir, I
like neither of them.—Was there ever such an
unaccountable little wretch! said Sir George, an∣grily.
Only I can't think you so void of pride, and
so regardless of the honour of your family, I should
think you had set your heart on some one you are
ashamed to name! And apropos, sister, what is your
charge, Mr. Falkland, doing at present? The man∣ner
in which my brother spoke this, and the indignant
eye he fixed on Cecilia, shewed too plainly where his
suspicions pointed. I thought just then of what you,
my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, formerly hinted to me, and felt myself ex∣ceedings
shocked. However blind Cecilia may be
with regard to my lord V—, replied I, I am sa∣tisfied
<PB N="10" REF="185"/>
neither her prudence nor her duty would suffer
her to engage her affections, contrary to the interests
as well as happiness of her family. You forget, cried
Sir George, that young ladies brought up in shady
groves, by murmuring rills, always consult the incli∣nations
of their own hearts, before they do that of the
interests of their family;
<Q>“For what are titles, wealth, or fame, to love.”</Q></P>
<P>The sarcastic air with which my brother accompa∣nied
this, seemed to cut Cecilia to the quick. She
turned towards me, and with a spirited action catching
me by the hand, if I am permitted, Madam, said she,
to decline my lord V—'s alliance, you will find I shall
justify the opinion you are so good as to have of me;
for I here promise you, that however I may be im∣pelled
by inclination, (for I will not pretend to answer
for my own heart) I will never transgress the duty I
owe you. And so your friends are to sit down con∣tented,
ma'am, on the strength of this equivocation,
said my brother, to wait till your capricious ladyship
shall find yourself in the humour to obey them! May
not the same speech serve your turn for any other
match that may be proposed to you? If you have
taken the resolution to live single, you had best say so
at once? Sir, I have made no such resolution.—
Very well, Miss, you may retire; we'll talk to you
farther on this subject to-morrow.</P>
<P>I know not what to make of this girl, said Sir
George, (after she was gone out of the room) but this
much I am sure of, there must be something more at
the bottom of all this than dislike of my lord V—:
if her heart be engaged, it is, (I am almost ashamed
to say it) but it is, it must be to Falkland; for be as∣sured,
Sidney, that young fellow inherits all the art of
his d—n'd mother.—Dear brother, how can you
be so implacable? You have already, said he, been
a martyr to your own credulity, and that of other peo∣ple;
for Heaven's sake, sister, at length learn a little
worldly wisdom. I know Falkland hates lord V—,
and without insisting on his being himself the favourite
<PB N="11" REF="186"/>
of Cecilia, I am certain he secretly puts her against
him, for she was more decisive in her rejection of him
to-night than ever I heard her before. I could not
help agreeing with him in this observation. I think
then, said he, the seldomer you admit of his visits the
better; and I shall take it as a favour, if you will
at least prevent them whilst I continue here; for I
would by no means chuse to see him after what passed
between us, the particulars of which I suppose your
daughter may have informed you. I told him Mr.
Falkland had never come to my house since the first
night of my lord's arrival, when they happened to
meet; and at the same time I let him know the oblig∣ing
offer my lord V—had made him. 'Tis more than
he deserves at his hands, said my brother, and had I
thought it worth while to inform lord V—of his au∣dacious
behaviour, I believe the young man would
have received a compliment of a very different nature
from him; but I am glad that I had caution enough
not to trouble him with the petulance of a forward
boy, and am now extremely pleased that Falkland is
likely to be sent out of the way.</P>
<P>I intended sending off this letter to you to-day; but
as it is already of an unconscionable size for the post.
I will defer sending it till to-morrow, when I shall have
the opportunity of a private hand; for I am just this
minute told, that one of lord V—'s servants is ar∣rived
from London with some dispatches to him, and
that he is to return again to town to-morrow, I have
not yet quitted my chamber this morning; but I am
now summoned to breakfast, so here I will lay down
my pen.</P>
<P>Monday night.</P>
<P>Nothing, my Cecilia, nothing but fresh embarrass∣ments;
where they will end Heaven only knows; My
lord V—received a packet of letters from Lon∣don
this morning, and amongst others, one which
brought him an account of the death of that officer,
whose commission he had promised to Orlando. My
lord V—lamented him as a very worthy man
and a good officer; but declared his satisfaction at the
<PB N="12" REF="187"/>
same time, at having it in his power to fulfil his pro∣mise
to Mr. Falkland sooner than he expected. My
brother immediately laid hold on the hint, and said he
thought Mr. Falkland should be very glad to embrace
such an opportunity of entering immediately into ser∣vice,
as the campaign would probably soon open; and
that, in his mind, he could not do better than set out
immediately for the regiment. My lord V—was
of the same opinion, saying, as the military life was
altogether new to the young man, it might be of ad∣vantage
to him to be a little acquainted with it before
he was called into the field. What's your opinion,
sister? said Sir George. My lord and you are such
good judges of the question, answered I, that I can∣not
hesitate a minute in agreeing with you. What
say you, my good Sir? (to Mr. Price). I am entire∣ly
of your mind, said Mr. Price, and think the army
itself the properest school to fit him for his profession.
And you, Miss Cecilia, (rivetting his eyes on my
daughter's face) what do you think? She lifted not
her's from off her work, but with a deep blush, re∣plied,
I think as you do, Sir. I wish you did so in
<HI>other</HI> respects, answered my brother, coldly. I ob∣served
my lord V—'s eyes had been turned to∣wards
Cecilia from the time Sir George had put the
question to her. Her too apparent confusion had a
visible effect on him; he turned pale, and rising off
his chair, went out of the room. Sir George said it
would be proper to apprize Falkland of the affair, that
he might get himself in readiness with all convenient
speed; a line from you, sister; will be sufficient on
this occasion. I suppose he will not require much
time for preparation. I said I would go and write to
him directly. I had but just got into my closet, when
my brother tapped at the door, and telling me he
wanted to speak with me, begg'd I would allow him
a few minutes convention. Having let him in, Do
you think, said he, with his usual abruptness, that
your daughter has bestowed her affections on Falkland,
or not? for I am satisfied <HI>you,</HI> as well as I, observed
the agitation into which she was thrown on the men∣tion
<PB N="13" REF="188"/>
of his departure. I did, answered I, and am
exceedingly alarmed at it. A mean-spirited little
d—I, said he, stamping with his foot! is the
curse of worthless husbands to be entailed on the fa∣mily!
Softly, dear Sir George.—Softly! cried
he, I have not patience to think of such a depravity
of mind: admirable fruits of her education indeed
we are to expect, when we see her prefer to such a
man as lord V—a little insignificant wretch,
without family, fortune, or even name! Oh, Sidney,
see what your imprudent charity has done! Spare
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reproaches, dear brother; if the thing be as you
suspect—<HI>If</HI> it be! interrupted he, why can you
have any doubt about it? One thing, however, let me
warn you against; do not examine your daughter on
the subject; I know the ascendancy she has over you,
and how easily your heart is to be melted; the secret
once declared, the young lady will have no more mea∣sures
to observe; 'tis from her pride only that I enter∣tain
the least hopes of turning her from this scanda∣lous
attachment. Whilst she believes us ignorant of it,
perhaps she may be ashamed to acknowledge it; and
if we can get Falkland fairly out of the way, a little
time may probably bring her to herself. The oppor∣tunity
which now offers to send him out of the king∣dom
must by no means be let slip. My coldness to∣wards
him (which he very well knows) will be a suffi∣cient
excuse for your not asking him here whilst I re∣main
with you, which I purpose doing till he leaves
England: this you see will cut off all communication
between him and Cecilia; after he is gone, I fancy we
shall have less difficulty to manage her. This was
what I wanted chiefly to say to you, what do you
think of it?</P>
<P>I have not the least objection to your design, an∣swered
I; only I think it would be proper that both
my lord V—and I should see Mr. Falkland be∣fore
he goes away; and it would appear very particu∣lar
even to my lord himself, if Orlando were not per∣mitted
to take his leave of Cecilia. I hate those <HI>tak∣ings
of leave</HI> answered Sir George; however, when
<PB N="14" REF="189"/>
he is in readiness to depart, that may be contrived;
but let me of all things advise you not to suffer it to
be done in the presence of lord V—, left Cecilia's
emotions should betray her folly; and lord V—
knows the world too well to be imposed on by the
pretence of <HI>sisterly</HI> affection. My brother left me at
these words, and I sat down directly to my escruitore
to write a few lines to Orlando, wherein I informed
him of the news my lord V—had received this
morning, and that in consequence of it, it was thought
expedient by his friends (I named myself, lord V—,
and Mr. Price) that he should repair immediately to
the regiment. I desired him to bespeak every thing
that was necessary for this expedition, telling him that
Mr. Price should call on him in a day or two with
whatever sum of money he should want; and that as
I found my brother still retained a strong resentment
against him, I must deprive myself of the pleasure of
seeing him whilst Sir George continued at Woodberry,
hinting at the same time we would contrive to meet
before he left the country, I sent my letter off di∣rectly,
and in return received a note from Orlando,
promising he would obey my instructions. He writ a
letter at the same time to lord V—politely thank∣ing
him for the honour he had conferred on him.</P>
<P>I can add nothing more to this very long letter
but my own disagreeable reflections. Indeed, my
dear, I am now exceedingly afraid that my poor un∣happy
girl loves—Oh, Cecilia, my hand shakes
when I add the name of Falkland! Your surmises
on the occasion I thought not well founded; for I
concluded I myself must have been the first to discover
this fatal inclination. Is it not amazing that a crea∣ture,
who has never been from under my own eye,
should have been able with so much art to conceal
a secret of this nature? Yet I hope it has proceeded
no farther than a secret preference of Falkland in her
own heart; but if their love should be mutual and
acknowledged! Good God, in what a dreadful situa∣tion
are we all! Yet I cannot inform myself as to this;
<HI>you</HI> first advised me against examining Cecilia on the
<PB N="15" REF="190"/>
subject, and I followed your advice, yet more in com∣pliance
to a judgment which I think superior to my
own, than a persuasion in that particular instance of
its being rightly formed. My brother entering pretty
much into the same sentiments with you, has laid on me
the same injunction; I now see the necessity of it, and
have promised to observe it. Perhaps the absence of
Orlando may work a favourable change for lord V—, I
should be exceedingly grieved at parting with him if I
had not this desirable point in view, for I would fain flat∣ter
myself that Cecilia's attachment may be at bottom
but a childish inclination which will dye of itself when
the object is removed from her sight. I observed when
she sat down to dinner, that her eyes looked as if she
had been weeping, yet she affected to be as chearful as
usual; my brother seemed pleased with this effort of
her's; it justified his sagacity in supposing she would
be <HI>ashamed</HI> to give way to a weakness of which she
did not suppose her friends suspected her. My lord
V—was melancholy and frequently absent, yet
abated not of his tender attention to Cecilia; I be∣lieve
our thoughts all centered in the same point, how∣ever
differently we were affected.</P>
<P>Heaven send a favourable issue to an event which
now hangs in such suspence!—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss CECILIA ARNOLD to Miss ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is come, the hour is at length arrived,
when it is permitted Cecilia to unlock her bo∣som
and pour out the secrets of it into that of her dear
Dolly; yet do not look down upon me, my sweet philo∣sophic
sister, because perhaps your loftier mind is inca∣pable
<PB N="16" REF="191"/>
of a weakness to which my feebler reason has
yielded. You know I am a proud little hussy, and
cannot bear contempt.</P>
<P>[She then proceeds to give her sister an account of
the mutual affection between her and Mr. Falkland,
with the manner of their disclosing it to each other,
pretty nearly as Mr. Falkland has already related it in
his letter to Sir Edward Audley; after which, she tells
her of the particulars that occurred from the time of Sir
George Bidulph's arrival at Woodberry down to the
period where Mrs. Arnold concludes her last letter
and then continues:]</P>
<P>I judged from every thing I observed that my uncle
suspected Mr. Falkland to be the man whom in the
bottom of my heart I favoured; and that this more
than any thing else had determined him to hasten his
departure out of the kingdom. I saw too plainly that
my mama, in regard to my marriage with lord V—,
meant to yield up her natural right in the disposal of
me, and to delegate her power to Sir George; and I
had reason to believe that my lord V—'s passion for
me was strong enough to surmount the scruples which
his delicacy might otherwise have thrown in his way,
with respect to a woman who he was convinced enter∣tained
not any inclination for him, provided he thought
her indifference proceeded not from any prior engage∣ment
of her affections, and this was a point of which
I judged both my mama and my uncle would labour
to persuade him. The former, from really entertain∣ing
no suspicions of the truth; the latter, from a be∣lief
that I dared not acknowledge it. All these con∣clusions
I drew from several little observations I had
made at different times, upon their different conduct.
What part could I chuse in such a dilemma? I had
promised Falkland to be his at once, in case I saw no
means of escaping the other match. He pressed me
to the accomplishment of this promise; yet my love
for <HI>him</HI> could not so far extinguish that which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear
my mama, as to think of this without shuddering. I
resolved therefore on an expedient which you, I be∣lieve,
will think a strange one, yet the event justified
<PB N="17" REF="192"/>
my prudence in making choice of it. This was no
other than opening my heart to lord V—himself,
and imploring even his assistance against his own in∣terests,
the interests of his love!</P>
<P>After forming my design, I was not slow in exe∣cuting
it. I writ two lines to my lord V—where∣in
I told him I had something important to say to him,
and begg'd he would meet me next morning at seven
o'clock in the cedar parlour. This room, you know,
as we hardly ever make use of it, secured me against
the fear of interruption, even from the servants. I
ventured to leave my little note myself on my lord's
dressing table, where I knew he must find it when he
retired to his chamber to go to bed.</P>
<P>I was so agitated the whole night at the thoughts of
what I had to say to <HI>him,</HI> and what he might surmise
of <HI>me</HI> in the interim, that I slept not a wink, and as
soon as I saw broad day-light, I arose, dressed myself,
and softly crept down stairs.</P>
<P>It was but three quarters past six; but my lord had
prevented me, and was already in the parlour. I said
I hoped I had not made him wait, and referred him
to his watch to shew that it was not yet the appointed
hour. In matters of mere business, Madam, said he,
a man may satisfy himself with being barely punctual;
but where the concerns of the heart are at stake, he
must be a flegmatic lover indeed who is not a little be∣fore
his time.</P>
<P>I selt myself exceedingly embarrassed; I scarce knew
how to begin the conversation. My lord V—
has a manly steadiness in his deportment that inspires
one with a kind of awe; I almost wished myself in my
own chamber again, but it was now too late. I made
a motion for him to sit down, he did so, and I took
my place opposite to him. He remained silent, though
with an impatience in his looks mingled with love and
respect. I collected myself as well as I could, and
addressing him. If I had not, said I, the highest
opinion in the world of your lordship's generosity, as
well as of your prudence and the goodness of your
heart, I had not dared to take the step I have now
<PB N="18" REF="193"/>
done. I must believe your curiosity is excited to know
what I have to say; my lord, I mean to open my
whole heart to you. He bowed to me, and I thought
seemed to tremble from head to foot, which, little
coward as I am, encouraged me to proceed. I should
be both insensible and ungrateful, continued I, if I
were not full of acknowlegements for the kind senti∣ments
with which you honour me, and for the ex∣treme
delicacy you have observed towards me; but,
my lord, when I say I acknowlege both, I must add
that I can only do it with gratitude and esteem; the
return you desire is not in my power to make. I own
you deserve my heart; but that was bestowed long
before you favoured me with your affection, otherwise
I should allow myself to be unjust in not giving you
the preference of which I think you so worthy. My
lord bowed again. I <HI>owed</HI> you this explanation, my
lord, continued I, and should (exclusive of any other
reasons) have thought myself bound to make it, as
well in justification of my own conduct, (which must
otherwise appear very capricious) as to shew you the
entire confidence I have in you. Having gone thus
far, my lord, I mean not to stop here, I will not con∣fide
in you by halves; Mr. Falkland is the person
who has had long possession of my affections; and
to deal plainly with you, I never can think of making
any other man my husband.</P>
<P>I thank you, Madam, answered my lord V—and
admire your sincerity, though it has confirmed my
despair.—I know, proceeded I, what my uncle's
designs are; from some hints he dropt, I am satisfied
that he suspects I love Mr. Falkland; he is earnest to
get him out of the way; I see well the measures he
intends to pursue after that; he is extremely persever∣ing
in every thing he wishes to accomplish; he has
your lordship's alliance much at heart—He inter∣rupted
me here with some vivacity, And can you think
so meanly of me, Madam. said he, as to believe that
after the declaration you have just now made, I would
like a ravisher seize your reluctant hand? No, Ma∣dam,
precious as I should esteem the gift were it vo∣luntarily
<PB N="19" REF="194"/>
bestowed, I would not accept it when forced
on me by the authority of a parent. Pardon me, my
lord, answered I; I entertain not the least doubt of
the generosity of your way of thinking; but every
man is not so delicate. There may be some who
would not scruple to take me even circumstanced as
you know me to be; and my uncle's prejudices are so
strong against Mr. Falkland, that once he is gone,
though your lordship were even out of the question—My
lord again intrrrupted me; How grieved am I,
Madam, said he, that you are so soon to be separated
from the object of your love; but do you wish that I
should contrive to postpone Mr. Falkland's journey till
I go myself to join the army, which will not be for
some time? I cannot now recall the charge I have be∣stowed
on him; had I sooner known the interest you
have in him, I would not have been the means of ex∣posing
to the chance of war a life so precious to you;
but be assured, dearest Miss Arnold, I shall have the
warmest attention to his preservation, his interest, and
his honour. I will forget that he is my rival while I
consider him only as one that is dear to you. I could
not refrain from tears. Oh, my lord, you oppress me,
said I: sentiments so noble!—so virtuous! why
have not I a heart to give you! Yet do not think so
slightly of me as to believe I have any reluctance to
Mr. Falkland's pursuing the paths of honour which
you have chalked out for him; I rely stedfastly on the
promise you have given me, and if he should happen
to fall, I think I have strength of mind enough to
console myself by reflecting on the cause. A manly
tear sprung into my lord V—'s eye, which dashing off
with a smile, Charming heroine! he called me. Then
after a short silence, Do you wish, Madam, said he,
that I should leave the house, and at least free you from
the sight of a man whose presence serves only to em∣barrass
you? I will, if you please, endeavour also to
draw Sir George with me to town, that you may be
freed from the restraint which now debars you of the
sight of your happy lover. You are too, too good,
my lord, said I, and I am almost afraid to put your
<PB N="20" REF="195"/>
generosity to any farther proof. Ah, do not spare me,
Madam, answered lord V—; after having lost
all hopes of your heart, my situation cannot be ren∣dered
more unhappy by any additional mortification;
tell me what can I do, to shew you how much I am
devoted to your service? I premised to your lordship,
said I, that if I had not the highest opinion imagina∣ble
of you, I had not dared to proceed as I have done;
but I confide wholly in you, and am now going to de∣mand
an important proof of that regard which you
profess for me.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, despairing of the consent of my
friends, urges me to marry him privately before his
departure. I received a letter from him yesterday to
this effect, wherein he says, 'tis the only means to se∣cure
his future happiness, and make him easy under
our separation. I have promised to be his; yet can∣not
persuade myself to take such a step without first
endeavouring, if possible, to move my mama, at
least, in his favour. She loves him dearly, and is of
so tender and yielding a disposition, that, were it not
through fear of my uncle's resentment, I should, be∣fore
this time, have ventured to disclose my secret to
her. Yet I own, now that matters have gone so far, I
have not the courage to do so. Will you, my lord,
be my advocate on this occasion? Your example, your
influence, must have great weight both with her and
my uncle. I believe your lordship knows that I have
a fortune not inconsiderable in my own power: 'tis
not then with any interested view that I would wish to
obtain their consent, but to spare my family the pain
they must feel for having driven me to an act of dis∣obedience,
and myself the grief of being divided from
relations I love so tenderly. Do you then, madam,
said my lord, rising off his chair with some emotion,
mean to go abroad with Mr. Falkland? Oh, by no
means, answered I; I desire no more than to quiet
Mr. Falkland's fears, who dreads the thoughts of leav∣ing
me in my uncle's disposal. May I my lord, may
I expect the favour I have demanded of you? You
<PB N="21" REF="196"/>
have imposed a hard task on me, madam, answered
lord V—. Is it that you think I have but a fee∣ble
passion for you? or that you believe I am void of
sensibility? Neither the one nor the other, said I; I
believe you love me sincerely, and I am sure there
exists not a more noble or feeling heart! Those are
the very reasons which determined me to make the re∣quest
to you. I would not have asked a man of an
ordinary soul; such trials are not for common minds:
but you, my lord, I know, are equal to them. Will
you then, will you give me this last generous proof of
your love? Madam, I <HI>will,</HI> said my lord; you shall
see, by this effort to oblige you, what I am capable of
doing for your happiness—What, indeed, would I
<HI>not</HI> do! He pronounced these last words in a tone
that made me think he was almost moved to tears.
I felt my eyes moist—I will not thank you, my lord:
where a favour is <HI>above</HI> acknowlegement, words are
of no use. I do not despair, said he, (recovering
himself) of working on the ductile heart of Mrs.
Arnold; but for Sir George Bidulph, I scarce know
how to make the attempt; yet I will venture on
it for your service.—What is <HI>his</HI> interest, what
are <HI>his</HI> feelings, what <HI>his</HI> loss, in comparison to <HI>mine!</HI>
My lord clasped his hands together in uttering this last
word, fixing his eyes on me at the same time with
such an expression of sadness as wounded me to the
very heart. I was obliged to turn from him to hide
my tears. I beg your pardon, Madam, said he, I
meant not to move your pity, or to inspire you with
any regret for <HI>my</HI> fate; forgive the last transports of a
passion which has already caused you but too much
uneasiness.—Ah, my dear, is not this an exalted
man? Why were we not born for each other!</P>
<P>I have a thought come into my head, said my lord,
which I beg you will let me pursue my own way. Sir
George Bidulph and I am engaged to dine to-day with
Doctor T. one of the heads of the university; but I
will make some pretence for not attending him, be∣cause
I should like to take this opportunity of having
<PB N="22" REF="197"/>
some conversation with Mr. Falkland. Will you, Ma∣dam,
send him a line to request his company here at
five o'clock this afternoon? you may say I wish to talk
to him; but I beseech you not to hint any thing more
—Ask me not, added he, how I mean to proceed; I
will not tell you my plot, though you yourself shall be
an actor in the dram<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I told him I should leave the
conduct of the scene entirely to his lordship, and
should not make any enquiries into his design. I then
said I believed it was almost my mama's hour of rising,
and would therefore detain him no longer. He imme∣diately
withdrew, and I slipped up to my chamber by
the back stairs, and writ a few lines to Mr. Falkland
just in the terms my lord prescribed.</P>
<P>Orlando had sent me word in his letter of yesterday,
that he would see me this very morning: for though
he has not made his appearance at our house since
my lord V—has been our guest; we neverthe∣less
sometimes steal half an hour's conversation in my
ivy-bower, as I call it: you know he can enter it with∣out
being seen, by means of the little door that leads
into the field, to which he has got a key. I expect∣ed
him therefore, I say, this morning; but I was
desirous of preventing his visit, that I might not be
under a necessity of making any previous explanations,
as my lord had requested that I should not. Having
dispatched my note, I sat myself down to give you
this account. I shall break off here, and shall re as∣sume
my pen in the evening, to tell you the result of
my lord's intended measures.—<HI>What</HI> will they
produce! I have a thousand worlds at stake! Oh, sis∣ter,
sister, how my heart beats with apprehension!—</P>
<P>Ten o'clock at night.</P>
<Q><L>Oh, day the fairest sure that ever rose,</L>
<L>Go, wing'd with pleasure take thy happy flight,</L>
<L>And give each future morn a tincture of thy white!</L></Q>
<P><PB N="23" REF="198"/>
Ha, said I not well, my dear, that my lord V—
was the noblest of men? Oh, Dolly, what transports
would it give me to see <HI>you</HI> the happy wife of that
worthy lord! You think me mad, and, to say the
truth, I am a little beside myself, things have taken so
strange, so unexpected, so charming a turn! To put
an end to your suspence at once, and to give you a
satisfaction equal almost to my own, know that Falk∣land,
<HI>your</HI>'s and <HI>my</HI> beloved Falkland, is at length per∣mitted
to call me <HI>his!</HI> But take, according to my ma∣ma's
method, every thing in order as it happened;
there is not a circumstance but what is worthy to be
writ in letters of gold.</P>
<P>My uncle, agreeably to his engagement, went to
dine with Doctor T. my lord V—feigned him∣self
a little indisposed, and sent an apology. Mr. Falk∣land,
in consequence of my summons, came precisely
at five o'clock. My lord V—had ordered one of the
servants to wait his arrival at the gate, and to conduct
him directly to my dressing-room, where he had pre∣viously
desired me to be in readiness to receive him. I
resolved implicitly to follow his instructions, and was
there accordingly when Mr. Falkland was shewn into
the room. He supposed this was done by my private
directions; and as there was nothing extraordinary in
my lord V—'s desiring to see him at this particular
juncture, he was not surprized at it. He had been
informed by my note that my uncle was not to be at
home, and concluded we had taken that opportunity
to send for him. He naturally imagined that lord V—
would not think of entertaining him in my apartment,
and expecting to be called away into another as soon
as his lordship should hear of his being come, he re∣solved
to spend the few minutes he supposed he had to
be alone with me on the subject which was nearest his
heart; so that entering at once into it, without asking
any questions relative to lord V—, he began to urge
me with extreme earnestness to consent to the having
our hands joined before his departure; but finding me
wore reluctant than ever to his proposal, he fell on his
<PB N="24" REF="199"/>
knees before me, and was employing all the rhetoric
of a lover to persuade me, when we were surprized
by the sudden appearance of my mama and lord V—
who entered the room together.</P>
<P>I will not speak of my, <HI>own</HI> confusion at this sight;
great as it was, it was nothing in comparison to that of
Falkland. As I had already paved the way for my
mama's coming to the knowlege of our secret, I was
prepared for the discovery, though I little expected my
lord would have made it in this manner; but for poor
Orlando it was a thunder-clap that he could not sup∣port.
How I felt for him in that minute! and secret∣ly
reproached myself for not having given him some
little notice of the step I had taken. My mama start∣ed
back as she entered, for she saw him on his knees
holding one of my hands. She leaned with her back
against the wainscot, and without being able to speak,
look'd at us by turns; but with more, I thought, of
sorrow than surprize in her countenance. Mr. Falk∣land,
his face covered with a deep blush, hung down
his head, and as if overwhelmed with a consciousness
of some unpardonable crime, seemed afraid to lift up
his eyes to my mama. How <HI>I</HI> looked I don't know,
but I suppose very like a fool. My lord V—had
the only unembarrassed face amongst us. He, how∣ever,
kept silence, and, I thought, for a while ap∣peared
to enjoy the confusion into which he had
thrown us all. At length approaching Mr. Falkland,
he took him by the hand, and with an ingenuous free∣dom,
Recover yourself, Sir, said he, and do not be
ashamed to own a passion for an object so worthy of
your love as Miss Cecilia Arnold; and you, Ma∣dam,
(turning towards me) have no reason to blush
for returning the tenderness of this amiable young
man. I no longer complain of your indifference for
me, the cause too well justifies your sentiments; and
I should be the most unjust as well as unreasonable
of men, if I did not at once yield up all pretensions to
a heart, whose prior engagements, as they forbid all
<PB N="25" REF="200"/>
hope on my part, so do they deprive me of any pre∣tence
for complaining.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, encouraged by my lord's friendly and
generous declaration, now ventured to look up. My
lord, said he, I am too much confounded to return you
the acknowlegements that I ought.—There is
something in your conduct that amazes!—that
almost dazzles me!—forgive me, my lord, my
confusion will not suffer me to express what I feel.—Then
drawing near my mama, he flung himself at her
feet. But can <HI>you,</HI> Madam, said he, can <HI>yon</HI> forgive
the presumptuous wretch, who, forgetting the thousand
obligations he has to you, and the distance that fortune
has thrown between us, has dared to lift his eyes up
to your Cecilia? I thought this was my time to speak,
and following Mr. Falkland's example, I threw myself
suddenly at my mama's knees, which I embraced;
And can you, mama, said I, pardon the ungrateful girl,
who, spite of her duty and the love she bears you,
has ventured to bestow her heart without your know∣lege?
Good God! cried my mama, crossing her arms
upon her breast, whilst we both hung upon her, <HI>What</HI>
is this that you acknowlege! I <HI>can</HI> not punish you; and
I <HI>ought</HI> not to pardon you—Pray, my lord, help me to
disengage myself from these unfortunate children.—
And why disengage yourself, Madam? answered my
lord; why will not you rather suffer yourself to be
touched with compassion? What recompence can you
make your child for dividing her from the only man
she can love? And what will avail all your maternal
care of this young man's infancy, all your kind atten∣tion
to his education, and your concern for his future
welfare, if the same hand which has so long cherished
and preserved him, now dashing with bitterness all your
benefits, wounds him where the heart most sensibly
feels, blasts all his hopes, and consigns, perhaps, his
promising youth to despair? Ah, Madam, you can∣not
have the heart to do it—let your children's tears
prevail; let my entreaties, who sacrifice an interest
<HI>much</HI> dearer than a parent's; let your own tenderness,
a mother's tenderness speak in their favour.—My
<PB N="26" REF="201"/>
lord might have continued his supplications, if his own
emotions would have suffered him; for we were none
of us in a condition to interrupt him. Mr. Falkland
and I were drowned in tears; my dear mama's eyes
ran like two fountains, yet she made an effort to break
from us; but we both clung about her feet. Do not
leave me, mama! I sobbed out.—Have pity on me,
Madam! was all Mr. Falkland could utter.—Have
pity on <HI>me,</HI> my poor mama cried out, and do not tear
my heart thus between you!—Just as she spoke these
words, my uncle Bidulph and Mr. Price presented
themselves at the door.—(Their sudden appearance
looked like enchantment; but I'll tell you by and by
how it came about.) What can all this mean? cried
my uncle, as he entered the room: then stopping short,
My lord V—! has any misfortune happened in the fa∣mily
since I left you this morning? There has, said my
mama; I leave it to my lord to explain to you what it
is. I know of none, answered my lord V—, but
what is in your power, Madam, and that of Sir George
Bidulph to turn into a blessing. Then addressing my
uncle, Look at this pair prostrate before you, Sir
George, said he, look at them, and guess the rest. It
should seem, replied my uncle, as if this young lady
and gentleman were solliciting Mrs. Arnold's consent
to their marriage; yet I cannot think it possible that
my niece should be so lost to duty and discretion, or
that Mr. Falkland has so far forgot himself—Mr.
Falkland started up from his knees, piqued with re∣sentment
at the severity of my uncle's expression, and
turning to him with a spirited air, though not without
respect, No, Sir George, said he, Falkland has not
forgot himself, he remembers the obligations <HI>above</HI> re∣compence
that he has to the best of women, (point∣ing
to my mama) he remembers that he is an unhappy
orphan without a friend to own him, he remembers too
well the misfortune of his birth, and he knows too
that if it had not been for Mrs. Arnold's pious care,
his mind might have been debased as low as is his for∣tune,
which now exposes him to the contempt with
which he is treated. Yet conscious as he his of all this,
<PB N="27" REF="202"/>
he has dared to love your niece, nay, to own it, and
is even bold enough to sollicit Mrs. Arnold for her
consent to his happiness; for under all these mortify∣ing
disadvantages, he remembers that he owes his birth
to a man whose son (had it not been for the fatal blow
that robbed <HI>you</HI> of his valuable life) would have re∣flected
honour, not disgrace, on the family to whom
he should have allied himself.</P>
<P>My uncle seemed struck at Mr. Falkland's resolute
reply; I see, said he, you have inherited at least some
share of your father's <HI>spirit.</HI> I have addressed you.
Sir, answered Mr. Falkland, as a man, as my equal,
and one to whom I owe no obligation upon that score.
I hope I have not transgressed the bounds which de∣cency
and good manners prescribe; but when I con∣sider
you as the uncle of Cecilia, the brother of Mrs.
Arnold, and <HI>once</HI> the dear friend of my poor father, I
again re-assume my suppliant posture (falling on his
knees and seizing my uncle's hand:) Oh, Sir George,
<HI>can</HI> you treat with inhumanity the son of Falkland?
My mama wept aloud, my lord V—seemed with dif∣ficulty
to refrain from tears; for my part, I was quite
dissolved, and the good old Price blew his nose two or
three times; my uncle himself appeared a good deal
moved. My lord V—, said he, it was not kind in
you to lead me into so disagreeable a situation as this.
I own I am quite at a loss to account for your lord∣ship's
conduct on this occasion. Account for it, an∣swered
my lord, from motives of companssion, from
that pity which I see at this minute working in your
own breast, I shall explain myself at large to you
hereafter, mean while I must assure <HI>you,</HI> that you have
been drawn into this affecting scene entirely without
the participation either of Miss Cecilia or Mr. Falkland,
and Mrs. Arnold has been equally surprized into it with
yourself.</P>
<P>Let me beg of you, Sir, to rise, said my uncle, to
Mr. Falkland. He did so. I am forced, continued
Sir George, into a very disagreeable share in this
eclai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cissement; I am heartily sorry, I ever interfered
in the disposal of Miss Cecilia; but I thought I was
<PB N="28" REF="203"/>
acquitting myself of a duty, and at the same time that
I was not rendering an unacceptable service to your
lordship. The happiness that you would have con∣ferred
on me, answered lord V—, I shall acknowlege
with the highest gratitude whilst I live, and I call to
witness him, who made and who knows the secrets
of our hearts, that if I could have obtained that of
your niece, I would not have given up my interest in
her for any thing this world contains; but, Sir George,
the lady <HI>herself</HI> acknowleged to me her love for Mr.
Falkland; after that confession, what proof could I
give her of the sincerity of my attachment to her,
but to endeavour, as far as was in my power, to pro∣mote
her happiness? It rests not on me, my lord, said my
uncle, coldly, to facilitate or retard her happiness, as you
are pleased to call it; I fancy the young lady is almost her
own mistress, for I presume my sister has half consented
already. You wrong me, Sir George, answered my ma∣ma;
I appeal to my lord V. and to these children them∣selves,
if I have in the least yielded. However I may
be touched by this unhappy event, I owe you that de∣ference,
brother, that I here declare I never will give
my consent to an union that has not your approbation.
My uncle was going to reply; I was afraid he would
by a decisive negative put an end to all our hopes, and
I was resolved to prevent him. Hold, dear uncle,
said I, and before you determine our fate, suffer me at
least to exculpate myself from the charge of disobedi∣ence.
I own I love Mr. Falkland; <HI>That,</HI> if it <HI>be</HI> a
fault, as it was an involuntary one, has not infringed
the laws of duty. I was taught from my earliest
childhood to consider him upon a footing of equality;
I loved him from the example of those whom I
thought it a merit to imitate. I knew my fortune en∣titled
me to a richer match; yet I knew at the same
time it gave me a privilege that I valued above riches.
I need not here, Sir, repeat the words of Mr. Warner's
will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Warner had in a preamble to that part of his will which related to his two young kinswomen, made use of the following words:</P>
<P>“And forafmuch as parents, guardians, and relations, do some∣times from mere caprice, or a greediness of wealth, withhol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their consents to marriages on which the happiness of their childrens lives depends; I do hereby give and bequeath to my two kinswomen Dorathea and Cecilia Arnold, the sum of twenty thousand pounds each, to be at their own full and free disposal at the age of eighteen years, relying on their prudence and the goodness of their dispositions; to the end that they may not (as their mother was) be compelled through fear to accept of a man they do not like.”</P>
<P>The last act of Mr. Warner's was very confident with the cha∣racter of that whimsical, though very worthy man.</P></NOTE>. Yet I have not, I mean not to avail myself of
<PB N="29" REF="204"/>
the power that has given me; I will not abuse the
good opinion Mr. Warner had of me, nor the confi∣dence
with which my mama has ever been pleased to
favour me. I would fain owe my happiness to your
indulgence, Sir, and that of the best of mothers. I
have not bestowed my affections unworthily; Mr.
Falkland's family is superior to my own, his education,
his accomplishments, his mind, all are worthy, of his
brith. You <HI>may</HI> forbid me to be his; but I never
will be the wife of any other man. For Heaven's sake,
my dear Sir George, said my lord V—, consider a
little of the merit or your niece's conduct; has she it
not in her power to marry Mr. Falkland, and to be∣stow
her fortune on him? where will you find a young
creature tenderly attached as she acknowleges herself
to be, who would forego such a privilege, and sacri∣fice
her own happiness to gratify a mere punctilio?—
Her mother did so, interrupted my uncle. And how
often, Sir, (as I have heard my mama say) did you
reproach her for that? answered I; and what pains
did you not take to persuade her to stick to her first
engagements? The cases are very different, said my
uncle; Mr. Falkland was a match of which the first
woman in the kingdom might have been proud to ac∣cept:
I mean not to depreciate this young man; but
I must say, the personal merit, the character, the for∣tune
of his father—Oh, Sir, cried Mr. Falkland, I
know how much he was superior to me in every thing;
yet there was a time when you saw him stripped of his
fortune, his character stained by a dreadful event, rob∣bed
<PB N="30" REF="205"/>
almost of his reason, and obliged to abandon his
family and his country; yet even then, under those
circumstances of complicated misery, you thought him
worthy of your sister, the best and the loveliest of
women; how can you then, Sir, reject<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the unhappy
son of him you once preferred to all mankind? I re∣member
the day said poor Mr. Price, (whose voice al∣ready
faltering with age, was rendered still more un∣steady
from the emotions of his mind) I remember the
day when I joined that lady's hand to Mr. Falkland's.
He was then such a fine young man as my pupil is
now, and Mrs. Arnold was such a beauty as her daugh∣ter
Cecilia; you, Sir George, with your own hand
gave the bride, and joyful you were to bestow her on
your noble friend: I did not think I should have lived
to see the hour, when a child of his would be despised
and spurn'd from your family! The good old man
melted into tears as he spoke.</P>
<P>So! said my uncle, I find you have got Mr. Price
of your side as well as my lord V—he affected to
say this carelesly, but I saw he was moved. I ventur∣ed
to clasp my arms round him, All the afflictions of
my dear mama's life, said I, and the cruel misfortunes
of poor Mr. Falkland's, were owing to the mistaken
zeal of my grand-mama Bidulph for her daughter's
happiness; will <HI>you,</HI> Sir, pursue a conduct that you
have often so justly censured? will <HI>you</HI> imitate that
stubborn authority that you have so often condemned?
and will <HI>you,</HI> in the person of that friendless young
man, perpetuate the miseries of his father whom you
have so o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten deplored?</P>
<P>What is it that you would have me do? said my
uncle, gently disengaging himself from my hold. You
do not seem to consider <HI>my</HI> character: what a figure
should I make in life, if after being known (for the
thing can be no secret) that I was in treaty with lord
V—, I should all of a sudden break off, and consent
to a marriage where the disparity is so obvious? Me∣thinks
you should in the midst of your passion have
some regard to your reputation; for matches of this
kind are rarely concluded with the consent of parents,
<PB N="31" REF="206"/>
but where there are reasons to which, for the lady's
sake, her friends are obliged to yield. That is by no
means a necessary conclusion, Sir George, answered
my lord V—, nor is the world so severe in its censures
as not to suppose that parents may sometimes have ten∣derness
enough to sacrifice their own wishes, however
laudable, to the more immediate happiness of their
children; nor will any one be in the least surprized,
that two amiable young people, bred up together,
should have a preference for each other, without draw∣ing
any inferences unfavourable to either side. Do
you hear that, Madam? said my uncle to my mama.
Oh, sister, you may blame yourself for all this! I do,
I do, cried my mama, I acknowlege my error, I feel
the punishment; but it is now past remedy. Brother,
added she, I yield up Cecilia to your disposal; had
you been able to accomplish an alliance with lord V—,
my joyful consent would have gone along with it;
since we are disappointed in that, I can only say, that
let your determination be what it will, my concurrence
shall go hand in hand with it. A very pretty way, said
my uncle, smiling, of slipping your neck out of the
collar: Ah, Sidney, I guess to which side of the ques∣tion
your approbation would willingly attach itself.
And so do I too, said Mr. Price; I know Mrs. Ar∣nold's
love for her children would incline her to with
their mutual happiness. What is there lost by the ex∣change,
said lord V—, but a worthless title on which
Miss Arnold would reflect more honour than she could
receive from it? Mighty fine, mighty fine, said my
uncle. Well, ladies and gentlemen, you may act as
you think proper; but supposing <HI>I</HI> were to give up my
interest in this affair, how do you think to answer it to
lady Sarah? If you, Sir George, said my lord V—,
will, by determining yourself in our favour, (how deli∣cate
was that little word <HI>our!</HI>) permit Mrs. Arnold to
do so too, <HI>I</HI> will engage to reconcile lady Sarah to our
proceedings. Will you? said my uncle: saith, my
lord, then that is more than <HI>I</HI> would undertake to do:
but I grant your lordship's eloquence is very much su∣perior
to mine.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="207"/>
My uncle walked about the room, and appeared ir∣resolute
and unwilling to speak. Let me conjure you,
Sir, to pronounce my sentence, cried Mr. Falkland,
for I stand here in the condition of a criminal, whose
life or death depends on the lips of his judge. Mercy!
mercy! in a tremulous voice, cried the venerable Price.
And forgiveness, added I, again falling at my uncle's
knees. Come, Sir George, said my lord V—, I know
you will yield; lessen not the grace by deferring it
too long. Well—since I <HI>must</HI> yield—Mrs.
Arnold, you have my consent to act agreeably to your
own inclinations.—You see, Sir George could not
bring himself to yield with a good grace; but this was
enough: my mama sprung to me, and raising me up,
Cecilia, said she, I forgive you, and charge <HI>myself</HI> with
the error of your conduct; She then led me to Mr.
Falkland, and putting my hand into one of his, Take
her, Orlando, said she, I give her to you for the love
I bore your father; I pray Heaven make your marriage
happier than—My mama could proceed no far∣ther,
her voice was choaked by tears. Mr. Falkland
kissed her hands upon his knees; then approaching my
uncle, he bent one knee to him in token of an acknow∣legement
and duty. My uncle stooped down his body
in a bowing posture; but without offering to raise him,
only said, Sir, I sincerely wish your happiness. Mr.
Falkland then thanked my lord V—, and Mr. Price in
their turns, who both embraced and congratulated
him.</P>
<P>This affair being now determined, said my uncle, I
should be glad to know what Mr. Falkland means, to
do? I should suppose that what has now passed ought
not to make any change in resolutions with regard to
the army. I know of no profession to which he can
betake himself with so much honour; and as it is that
to which he has been always destined, he would ap∣pear
with a very ill grace at such a juncture as this,
when all the young men in the kingdom are eager to
express their zeal for the service of their country, if he
should now decline the opportunity which my lord
V—has given him to shew himself at least as forward
<PB N="33" REF="208"/>
as others. My lord V—was silent, yet it was very
easy to see by his countenance that he was of my un∣cle's
opinion, for my lord V—, my dear, is a soldier
from head to foot. As for myself, though I secretly
wished Mr. Falkland had not embraced so hazardous
a way of life, and already began to tremble at the
thoughts of his departure; yet after the bravery I had
shewn in my conversation with lord V—on this sub∣ject,
I was ashamed to make the least objection. Mr.
Falkland, I believe, guessed what passed in my mind.
There is, nothing, replied he, which is capable of mak∣ing
me change, my resolution, unless it be the will of
Miss Cecilia; if she does not forbid it, I shall esteem
myself happy, if under the auspices of my lord V—,
I am permitted to follow both my duty and my inclina∣tion.
I know not whether Mr. Falkland was quite
sincere in making use of the <HI>last</HI> expression; but the
affair had been put to him in such a light by Sir George
that he could not well make any other reply. What
do <HI>you</HI> say, madam? said my lord V—, 1 was vexed
the question came from <HI>him;</HI> I thought myself doubly
obliged to comply Far be it from me, my lord, said
I, (very stoutly) to obstruct Mr. Falkland's road to
glory!</P>
<P>You do not in end then, I presume, said my uncle,
to marry at this juncture? I suppose Cecilia would not
chuse to make a campaign? and I think, Mr. Falk∣land,
after the assurances he has just now received,
may venture his mistress in the hands of his friends till
his return, when he may appear in a sort of rank in
life that will better justify our consenting to this mar∣riage;
for after all, what a strange appearance would
it have for a match to be clapt up so suddenly, for
such a girl as Miss Arnold with a lad in the university?
A little constrained smile which shewed itself at once
on the face of lord V—, my mama, and even the se∣rious
good old Price, gave a kind of a tacit assent to
my uncle's observation. There is one method, said
Mr. Falkland, to obviate this apparent impropriety;
our marriage may be kept concealed.—My uncle ob∣jected
to this, and offered reasons unnecessary to be re∣peated,
<PB N="34" REF="209"/>
and which I should have been much better
pleased he had not offered at all. Mr. Falkland was
earnest in having the affair concluded his own way,
when my mama, afraid, I believe, of his offending
my uncle, interposed; Let us consider of this another
time, said she; it is a thing of too much consequence
to be determined so hastily. Then, with a design to
turn the discourse, she asked my lord V—how he had
contrived matters so, as to assemble the whole family
together at so critical a juncture? Lord V—related as
much of the conversation I had with him this morning
as he thought necessary to his purpose; kindly sup∣pressing
that circumstance of my having asked his me∣diation;
but acknowleging at the same time, that from
the moment I had opened my heart to him, he had re∣solved
to do his utmost to assist me. He said, that
having desired Mr. Falkland's company that evening
under colour of business, he had given private orders
to one of the servants to conduct him to my dressing-room,
and in about a quarter of an hour after his ar∣rival
to come in to the room where he was sitting with
my mama, to give him notice that Mr. Falkland was
come. I concluded by that time, said my lord, that
the lovers, might be engaged in an interesting con∣versation;
and not doubting but our sudden appear∣ance
would make an open for the scene I meditated, I
very naturally requested Mrs. Arnold to step with me
into the chamber, where I was told Mr. Falkland
waited for me. I led you, madam, as you know (pro∣ceeded
he, addressing himself to my mama) in a most
favourable moment to your daughter's apartment. As
for Sir George, I believe he must have been extremely
surprized at receiving a note from me whilst he was at
dinner at Doctor T—'s, to beg he would return home
as early in the evening as possible, something of impor∣tance
requiring his presence. I had before-hand en∣gaged
Mr. Price in his pupil's interests, and obtained
from him a promise of assistance. By calculating hour,
I was certain Sir George would arrive here a short
time after Mr. Falkland, whom I had appointed to
come at five o'clock; I begged of Mr. Price to be in
<PB N="35" REF="210"/>
the way to receive him, and without letting him know
that Mr. Falkland was in the house, to conduct Sir
George directly to us. This, madam, is the machine∣ry
of which I have made use to bring about this un∣expected
catastrophe, and I draw some consolation in
having at least been instrumental to Miss Cecilia's hap∣piness.</P>
<P>I now gave Mr. Falkland a hint to retire, lest he
should renew those instances that I saw were so unac∣ceptable
to my uncle. He took his leave after reitera∣ted
acknowlegements to every one present.</P>
<P>My uncle was not in a very good humour for the re∣mainder
of the evening, and often recurred to what
lady Sarah would say to this <HI>strange</HI> event. He said he
would write to her in order to prepare her for it, be∣fore
he would <HI>venture</HI> to acquaint her with it as a thing
on which we had concluded. So that, my dear, you
are not to mention a syllable to her of what I have
now written to you. My mama was rather thought∣ful;
yet I fancy at the bottom she is not much displeas∣ed.
Our dear good old man seemed quite delighted;
and as for my lord V—, he behaved like an angel;
without arrogating to himself any merit for what he
had done, or appearing even conscious of the gene∣rosity
of his own conduct, he shewed only that modest
and placid composure which a good mind feels on hav∣ing
acquitted itself of a duty.</P>
<P>My mama, with whom I had half an hour's conver∣sation
before she retired to bed, demanded many parti∣culars
of me relative to the attachment between Mr.
Falkland and me; to all her questions I answered
with great sincerity. She said, she had been rather
too precipitate, and that she owed you that mark of
respect as well as tenderness, to have made you ac∣quainted
with the affair before it was decided: but
I ventured to answer for my dearest Dolly, that she
would be perfectly satisfied with the determination.
My mama said she supposed Mr. Falkland would be
extremely urgent to have our marriage concluded be∣fore
he left England; and that she was sure Sir George
would be averse to it: For my part, added she, I shall
<PB N="36" REF="211"/>
be neutral; since I <HI>have</HI> consented, I desire not to yield
my concession by halves. I assured her I would much
rather the marriage were postponed till Mr. Falkland
returned home again, which I hoped, if Heaven spar∣ed
his life, would be in less than a year. It then rests
upon you, child, said she, to determine the matter one
way or other.</P>
<P>I am sorry my mama has in this instance given up her
authority over me, because it is less in my power than
it would be in her's to oppose Mr. Falkland's entreaties;
yet I will on this occasion try what my influence over
him will effect. I am sure it will be more grateful to
all parties, to have the business deferred, even to the
worthy lord V—himself; and I owe him at least this
compliment.</P>
<P>After a day spent in so much anxiety, and concluded
with so much agitation, I was very glad to get up into
my own chamber, and sit down quietly to finish my
letter to you, if such a volume can be called by that
name. I have spent half the night in writing it, and
am glad I shall have an opportunity of sending it off to∣morrow.
My mama tells me my uncle intends writing
to lady Sarah to-night, just to make an opening, as he
calls it, of this most <HI>astonishing</HI> affair! The messenger
sets off by day-break, and is to return again in the af∣ternoon,
so that I shall hope for a line from you by
him.</P>
<P>I expect some violent rubs from lady Sarah, but they
will only grate the skin a little; and so long as I am
out of her reach, the scratches will heal of them∣selves.</P>
<P>From you, my love, I look for congratulations; and
can only in return wish you as happy a lot as that of</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 10th,</DATE>
eight o'clock in the evening.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<Q>[In this letter▪ he gives his friend a brief account of
what had passed that evening at Mrs. Arnold's,
and then proceeds:]</Q>
<P>—Here's a revolution for you, Audley, beyond hope,
beyond imagination! What would I now give to recall a
few short months! But I will not spend my time in
useless imprecations, either on your unlucky zeal, or
my own folly. I have but one hope now left to reme∣dy
the past evil, and that is a reliance on the meek
forgiving temper of Miss Arnold, joined to her fears of
acknowleging a fault, of which you say, and I believe
she has, more than once, in secret repented. I know
her gentle nature will not suffer her to think of re∣venge.
To what purpose then, by an ill-timed avowal
of her own weakness, destroy the happiness of others,
without deriving from it any consolation to herself?
You will see by the inclosed letter, which I have lest
open on purpose for your perusal, the arguments, or
rather the conjurations (for the case will not admit of
many arguments,) of which I have made use, to pre∣vail
with her to bury in eternal silence our ill-fated
amour.</P>
<P>The favour I have to entreat of you, Sir Edward,
is to get this letter put into her hands with the utmost
privacy, and all possible speed. Her maid has been
the medium through which all my letters have lately
passed, and you may safely confide it to her care.</P>
<P>I shall, in order to be before-hand with the family
of Woodberry, dispatch this by a special messenger,
<PB N="38" REF="213"/>
who has orders not to spare his horses; so that I pre∣sume
this may kiss your hands about your ordinary
hour of going to bed. I take it for granted, Cecilia
will not give her sister a faithful narrative of this whole
affair; and that lady Sarah will also receive advice of
it from Sir George; but if you are punctual▪ I must
anticipate them all; for my letter may easily salute
poor Dolly Arnold's uprising to morrow, and the deuce
is in it if any intelligence from them can reach her be∣fore
mid-day at soonest, or perhaps not till Wednes∣day;
for not having the same reasons to urge their ex∣pedition
that I have, they may probably make use of
the ordinary conveyance of the post.</P>
<P>My heart would fain deliver itself up to extacy, yet
dare not do it. Oh, Audley, if Miss Arnold should
forgive, as well as release me of my promise! in that
case I should only desire you to pray (if you ever per∣form
such a ceremony) that I might not run mad for
joy. As for your schemes with regard to possessing
yourself of this girl, I would recommend it to you to
lay them aside, for I think it will be a vain attempt.
If hereafter I shall see the smallest open for your suc∣ceeding
with her, be sure, Audley, you will find in me
a zealous friend.</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Miss ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am unworthy of your smallest regard, madam.—
I hate myself, and deserved to be abhorred by all
the world; but more particularly by you whose confi∣dence
I have betrayed, and whose esteem I have re∣paid
with ingratitude. You have long perceived, and
<PB N="39" REF="214"/>
sometimes (though I own but too tenderly) reproach∣ed
me with my growing coldness. Conscious as I was
of my guilt, I had not the courage to acknowledge it;
but endeavoured by mean arts to palliate a crime, which
I could not expiate. But let me tear off the treacher∣ous
veil, and expose at once to your eyes this vile of∣fender!
this <HI>pretended</HI> admirer of Miss Arnold; but
the <HI>real lover</HI> of her sister. Yes, madam, I own I
love Cecilia. My passion for her took root before my
heart was capable of deceit; and the first treachery of
which I was guilty was in offering those vows to you,
which I had secretly dedicated to her. Our mutual
misfortune has arisen from my coming at the knowlege
(by means of my too officious friend Sir Edward Aud∣ley)
of those favourable sentiments with which you
honoured me, at a time when I was so far from in∣dulging
myself with a hope that I had touched Ce∣cilia's
heart, that I presumed not to entertain the most
distant thought of being beloved either by you or her.
And I called Heaven to witness that I did my utmost
to guard my heart against a prospect so seducing, so
full of charms.</P>
<P>You may remember, madam, it was long before I
transgressed the bounds I had prescribed myself; that
by a fatal concurrence of circumstances, my evil ge∣nius
impelled me to offer you a heart which was not
mine to give; but I soon found my error, and. the dis∣covery
was followed by the deepest regrets for having
deceived a woman whose merit rendered her so worthy
of a better lot. Accuse me of falshood, of infidelity,
and, if you please, of the blackest dissimulation; I
merit it all; but charge me not with inconstancy, for
light as that censure is in comparison of my other
crimes, 'tis the only one of which I can exculpate my∣self.
My love for Cecilia was but for a while suspend∣ed,
it never was extinguished; and the first moment
in which I saw her, after our fatal engagements, it
blazed out again with redoubled force. I will leave
it to her, madam, to tell you what has been its pro∣gress
since; and will hasten to that point where every
hope, and every wish, where, in one word, my soul
<PB N="40" REF="215"/>
is centered. Your sister has condescended to honour
me with her hand; your mama (mine too let me call
her) touched with compassion, has been prevailed on to
yield it to me; and even Sir George Bidulph has at
length suffered himself to grant a reluctant consent.
Your friends will themselves soon inform you of every
particular. But can I, dare I presume to urge the in∣jured
lady, whom I have so highly offended, to concur
with her family in making happy the undeserving
wretch, who so justly merits her utmost indignation?
Yes, my amiable and respected friend, I <HI>must</HI> conjure
you; the despairing Falkland throws himself at your
feet covered with shame and remorse. His life is in
your hand, the life of him you once loved, and who
but for a fatality which he could not overrule, would
have made it the study, the pride of that life to have
deserved your love. Think that the peace of your
whole family is interwoven with mine; think, should
our unfortunate engagements be known, what might
be the consequence of Sir George Bidulph's justly pro∣voked
indignation, of your revered mama's but too
well founded sorrow, of your dear Cecilia's grief and
disappointment; and if you don't yet hate me, think
of my pangs, and remember my unhappy father's
fate! Think what will it avail you to divulge a crime,
of which, though I feel the horrors, I cannot repent?</P>
<P>You are too good, too compassionate to punish a
weakness, to which I have been driven by an irresistible
impulse; 'tis in your power to make me the happiest
or the most miserable of men. Let me beseech you,
madam, not to consult on this occasion the dictates of
your resentment; but let the daughter of <HI>Mrs. Arnold</HI>
imitate her mother's admirable example, who more than
once yielded up her own dearest interests to promote
the good of others, contenting herself with the silent
applause of her own noble mind. Write to me, I con∣jure
you, pour out your indignation on me; but con∣clude
with a line of comfort, and just say, “Falkland,
I bury your trespass in oblivion.”</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
Tuesday, five o'clock in the morning.</OPENER>
<P>THE speed of your courier has answered the
keenness of your wishes. I found the poor be∣numb'd
devil waiting for me when I came in from the
tavern where I had supped. And so you think I am
to dispatch your letter to Miss Arnold, return you by
the bearer an absolution signed by her in form, congra∣tulate
you on your approaching felicity, and sit down
contented with <HI>your pity</HI> on the loss of my hopes?
Why, what a sot art thou, Falkland, to fancy I can
look with patience at thy victory, and at the same time
see all my own expectations blasted! A notable com∣pliment
you have paid me truly, in yielding up to me
your pretensions to a woman whom you do not love;
but without making one effort to promote the accom∣plishment
of my wishes. Is this your friendship? this
the zeal that I expected from you? Selfish as thou
art, thou huggest thyself in thy own prosperity, and
leavest thy friend to the gaping ruin that surrounds and
is ready to swallow him up, without even stretching,
thy hand to draw him forth! But I will be plain with
you at once, Falkland; I will not send your letter to
Miss Arnold; an opportunity now offers to put me in
possession of her, which at the same time that it re∣deems
me from destruction, will more effectually secure
you against a discovery than all the whining epistles
you could scribble to her from this till dooms-day.
You think the affair impracticable, brainless fellow as
thou art, why 'tis as easy as lying; and thus will I
effect it:</P>
<P>Write me a short billet to Miss Arnold; tell her
that, “having something of the last consequence to
<PB N="42" REF="217"/>
communicate to her, you are come to town on pur∣pose
to have a personal conference with her. That
to avoid being seen in London for particular reasons▪
you have repaired privately to that house at Brump∣ton”
(where you may rememher my mother had
lodgings the beginning of the winter when Harry had
the chin-cough). Insist on her meeting you there;
you may say, to give it a better colour, that you have
no objection to my sister's being present at the confe∣rence,
(by the bye, both my mother and sister are now
on a visit to our cousin Bateman at Hampton-court):
inclose this letter to me. Assure yourself she comes
at all events, 'tis a matter of duty, putting love out of
the question. The house you know stands alone in the
middle of a garden; what a charming cage to enclose
so pretty a singing bird! The daughter of the woman
who keeps it is a very good girl, and my particular
friend; 'twas I who recommended the lodgings to my
mother, as I now and then sleep there a night or so for
the benefit of the air. And now, Falkland, that you
may not have any qualms upon you, take my most
solemn oath, which I never violate to <HI>man,</HI> that I
will not injure the fair one. Miss Arnold is not a
Theodora Williams, she was not born to be the mis∣tress
of any one; but I think she will make an admi∣rable
wife. You will see it will all end in that; for how
can a young lady think of shewing her face again in
the world, after passing two or three days privately
with a young fellow, unless she appears in that cha∣racter?
Once I get her in my net, I shall give her
no other cause of complaint than that of detaining
her as my prisoner; for I mean to deport myself to∣wards
her with the sanctity due to a vestal; and when
she is my wife, you know, I can command her lips, so
that you will have nothing to fear from her. I dis∣patch
your express off again without loss of time. Hav∣ing
made the dog half drunk, I wish he may not break
his neck, before he arrives at Oxford.</P>
<P>If Miss Arnold should receive an account of what
is going forward at Woodberry, before you have time
to return me the answer I expect, so much the better;
<PB N="43" REF="218"/>
she will be the less surprised at your desiring a meeting
with her, and the more curious and impatient to have
an explanation from you. But trust not to the slow
conveyance of the post; leave that for such plodding
souls as are content to send their dull conceptions the
common dog-trot road; but fiery spirits, such as you
and I, should always have their Mercuries ready to
dart forth in an instant and execute their high be∣hests.—</P>

<OPENER>Miss ARNOLD to Mr. FALKLAND.
[It appears that she inclosed in this, the letter which,
her sister Cecilia had written to her, which she re∣ceived
the day after its date; and writ to Mr.
Falkland by the return of the same messenger,
who left it for him as he passed through Oxford,
in going home to Woodberry.]
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 11th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FIRST read the enclosed, and then form to your∣self
an idea of what she feels that writes to you!
I will not answer my sister's letter, indeed I <HI>can</HI> not;
for what could I say to her? Must I tell her, “Ce∣cilia,
you cannot be the wife of Falkland, <HI>his</HI> faith's
already plighted?”—but to whom?—Oh, Falkland,
why did you deceive me? I do not ask your love, I
know that is lost to me for ever; but I would beg you
to have pity on poor Cecilia, on my mama, and, if you
can, try to have a little on me. If you were torn from
me by death, it would not be <HI>quite</HI> so terrible, for then
I could follow you in silence and without shame; but
to be disgraced thus, cast off, and for one's own sister
too! that's very hard. Prithee, dear Orlando, wait
till I am dead before you marry my sister; it will not
<PB N="44" REF="219"/>
be long before you shall see that day. A constitution
naturally feeble, a long struggle against what at length
bore me down, joined to sickness and inward grief, had
already warned me that I had not long to live. Save
yourself then, save yourself the remorse of seeing my
days cut short by your own hand; save the tenderest
of mothers the anguish of seeing her daughter fall a vic∣tim
to despair; and save your dear Cecilia the horror
of knowing you to be the cause of it. She is unwilling
at this juncture to give you her hand; pray do not
urge her to it.—You are going to leave England—be∣fore
your return, I shall, in all human probability, be
in my grave. You will then be at liberty to pursue
your happiness; I love you too well to deprive you of
it. I will not tell my sister that you ought to have
been mine; let her become your wife, but let <HI>me</HI> not
live to see it.</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
[In which he inclosed Miss Arnold's letter.]
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have but half done your work, Audley,
for I find I am not yet a finished traitor. The
reading the inclosed letter, which I have just received
from Miss Arnold, has thrown me into a cold sweat,
and I almost repent of my injustice to her. There
is something in her soft complaints that pierce my
heart; yet I have gone too far to recede.—What will
become of me!—I would give up every hope I have
in life (except the possession of Cecilia) to restore
this unfortunate girl to the peace of which I have
robbed her. She bids me suspend my marriage—
What may be the consequence of such a suspension?
<PB N="45" REF="220"/>
If she had asked me to send her a leg or an arm by way
of expiation for my offence against her, I think I should
have done it freely.</P>
<P>All the miseries she has foretold perhaps may come
to pass, and my life may be rendered more wretched
by the accomplishment, than it would be by the disap∣pointment
of my wishes. My infidelity conducts <HI>one</HI>
child to the tomb, and the life of the <HI>other</HI> is imbittered
from the same fatal source. Mrs. Arnold, that res∣pectable
woman who has been more than a parent to
me, curses me as the cruel destroyer of her family.—
Execrable, ungrateful Falkland! And thou, Love,
inexorable fiend! will nothing satisfy thy vengeance
but my life, or that of the unfortunate Miss Ar∣nold?</P>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> not write that cursed letter to her which thou
hast dictated; I will not add treachery to treachery.
I could almost call this a sacrilege, for is it not giving
up the sacred treasure of innocence to a wicked spoiler?
Let the ruin that gapes for you swallow you up quick
if it will; for my part, I am not fit to live.—Prithee,
Audley, come down and shoot me through the head;
for if some one does not do it for me—</P>

<P>OF all devils, I hate a penitent devil. What a no∣ble
figure does Satan himself make, as he is de∣scribed
in the sixth book of Milton, where he boldly
desies the whole artillery of Heaven! And what a
sneaking rascal does he appear in the fourth book,
where, just like Falkland, he recapitulates his woes,
and bemoans his lost estate! But do, go on, give up
Cecilia, to oblige her sister, and leave thy name upon
<PB N="46" REF="221"/>
record for the arrantest poltroon that ever dared to call
himself a man. But what then? You will have the
consolation of having done a good-natured thing, and
then <HI>consciousness of inward rectitude,</HI> as old Price used
to say, will at any time make amends for the loss of
twenty or thirty thousand pounds, and the finest girl
in Europe. But the mischief of it is, the substantial
part of the evil won't be remedied by this either, for
thou art so involved in treason, that take which side
thou wilt, the matter <HI>can't</HI> be mended. Let's reason a
little. Miss Arnold, you say, has cause to complain
of your treachery. Granted: (for argument's sake
only.) But will not Cecilia have the same cause to
complain if you forsake <HI>her?</HI> She, being ignorant of
the priority of her sister's claim, has certainly by the
laws of equity as good a right to you as the other;
nay, if one takes in the whole merits of the cause, a
better; for she had secretly determined in your favour,
before the other little trembling fool dared even to per∣suade
herself that she loved you. The affair, how∣ever,
is, I confess, somewhat nice, and I am inclined
to think, that were Solomon now alive, and the case
brought before him, your sweet person would be con∣demned
to undergo the same sentence which he passed
on the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lot's child. We should then see which of the
two girls deserved you best. I'll be hang'd if Dolly
would not be content with half of you. Why, what
a letter have you received from that pretty Automaton!
The deuce take those milky dispositions, say I, that
have not gall enough in them to rouze them to a little
choler. Would not one, on such an occasion, have
expected a noble burst of rage befitting the mouth of a
princess in a tragedy? Or supposing the nymph to
write in the elegaic strain, should not the paper have
been blotted with her tears? ought she not to have
called you <HI>charming</HI> though cruel betrayer, and con∣jured
you by every thing that was tender to return to
yonr first vows? And should not there have been some
little insinuations of hanging on a willow, or drowning
in a purling stream? But no such thing, Sir, this piece
of living snow does not even strive to recall you; she
<PB N="47" REF="222"/>
renounces your love, she vouchsafes not even to up∣braid
you, and desires no other favour than that you
would <HI>postpone</HI> your marriage till after her death, of
which she talks as familiarly as she would do about a
puppet-show. Hang me, if I don't think she uses you
scurvily, and that she does not deserve the least pity at
your hands.</P>
<P>And all this water-gruel stuff has thrown you into
a cold sweat! How I blush for thee, Falkland! If
thy body were as infirm as thy mind, thou wouldst not
be fit to breathe out of an hospital. And how like a
coward dost thou conclude thy letter! Thou dost not
deserve so noble a death, as that thou wouldst receive
if I were to take thee at thy word.</P>
<P>But to come at once to the material purpose of my
letter. You say you <HI>will not</HI> deliver Miss Arnold into
my hands, into the hands of a <HI>wicked spoiler.</HI> Falk∣land!
I expected you would have believed my oath
upon this occasion; but your own want of sincerity
makes you suspect that of others; then hear me swear,
[Sir Edward Audley here makes use of such impreca∣tions
as the editor would not transcribe.] By all this,
I vow, if you do not deliver her into my hands, I re∣nounce
all farther communication with you, and will
with my own proper tongue, divulge your folly, and
what you <HI>call</HI> your crime, to all the Bidulph family,
to all the world, till you are the ridicule and contempt
of all that know you. You know I dare do what I
say. Weak irresolute man, are these the hopes you
gave me? Can the feeble complaints of a love-sick
girl shake you thus? and make you cancel the bonds
of a sworn friendship? And what would be the con∣sequence
of your dastardly compliance? If you leave
England without making Cecilia your's, mark my
words, you lose her for ever. Left in the hands of re∣lations
that contemn you, exposed to the conversation
of a rival, who, though I like him not, let me do him
the justice to say, has but too much to recommend him.
And who can answer (though my vengeance were out
of the question) who can answer for the generosity of
a forsaken mistress? think you that Miss Arnold would
<PB N="48" REF="223"/>
not divulge the secret? Oh, you know but a little of
womankind; if <HI>we</HI> do not betray them, they are sure
to betray themselves. In a word, you have no secu∣rity
but in the method I have proposed. Your own
interest as well as mine should determine you at once.
Put me in possession of my <HI>prize,</HI> and I'll answer for
the accomplishment of <HI>your</HI> wishes; nay, I'll undertake
to exculpate you from the imputation of this double
treachery, at which you are so much scared, and that
by the easiest turn imaginable. I will tell the lady that
you had really come to town on purpose to prostrate
yourself at her feet, and beg her forgiveness: That
you had actually intended meeting her at the very place
appointed; but that, as the hour of this dreaded in∣terview
drew near, you found you had not courage
enough to support the sight of <HI>her</HI> you had so much
injured; wherefore calling for pen, ink, and paper,
you had contented yourself with writing to her, and
having left the letter in my hands to be put into her's,
you immediately mounted your horse and again went
out of town. Then will I faithfully deliver to her your
petitionary scroll; in which if she finds any incon∣sistencies,
it must be imputed to your troubled mind.
And after having assured her of the sincerity of <HI>your</HI> in∣tentions,
I will take upon <HI>myself</HI> the blame of having
turned them to the interest of my own love.</P>
<P>Things will not now admit of foolish delays; you
know my ultimate resolution, so I leave you to think
of it, and give you four and twenty hours to consider
of my proposition, but not a minute beyond it.</P>

<OPENER>Lady SARAH to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 15th.</DATE></DATELINE>
My dear Sir George,</OPENER>
<P>WE are all here in the greatest confusion imagi∣nable.
I believe it is a very true observation,
that evils never come alone. Miss Arnold, your
grave, prudent, favourite niece, has thought proper to
elope. She asked my leave yesterday morning to wait
on Mrs. B—, who, she said, had sent to request her
company to dinner. You know no one on earth can
be more careful than I am of what company I let her
<PB N="50" REF="225"/>
keep; but as Mrs. B—is really an extremely good
sort of a woman, and very well bred, I never scrupled
to let her go there. Mrs. B—'s family dine ear∣ly,
and Miss chose to go even sooner than their hour
of dining. As she complained of not being very well,
I sent her in my own chair: Robert attended her. I
had an infinity of visits to pay in the evening, and
when I went out, ordered my chair to go again for her
at seven o'clock; but when I came home, which was
at a little after ten, I found all the house in a bustle;
the servants told me Miss Arnold was not yet come in,
and that they could give no account of her at Mrs.
B—'s. I immediately called up Robert, who
said that having attended her in the forenoon to Mrs.
B—, that he and the chairmen had orders to
wait a while; that Miss Arnold staid not longer than
a quarter of an hour there, and then directed them to
carry her to a milliner's shop in the same street, where
she went in and looked at some fans; after which she
stepped to the door, and telling the servants, that as
she had several things to buy which might detain her
a good while, they need not wait, for being so near
Mrs. B—with whom she was to dine, she would
walk back to her house. The man says he begged she
would let the chair carry her back, left she should
catch cold; but she insisted on their going home, tel∣ling
Robert his lady might have occasion for him;
upon which they went away, and left her there. I
asked the fellow why he did not tell me this as soon as
he returned; but his answer was, he thought nothing
of it.</P>
<P>When they went for her in the evening to Mrs.
B—'s, they were informed that she had not been
there since noon. The brutes had not the sense to ask
any more questions; but came away with this answer.
I hurried away directly to Mrs. B—'s, and found
the poor woman really under great uneasiness; for
having been told by her own servants that mine had
been to look for Miss Arnold; she had it seems in the
interim sent to my house to know if she were returned
home. All the account she could give me of her was
<PB N="51" REF="226"/>
this. That she had in reality sent the evening before
to request Miss Arnold's company to dine with her, as
she was to be quite alone; that your niece had sent
her word, she could not then give a positive answer,
as lady Sarah was not at home (which was indeed
true): That when Miss Arnold had called upon her
about one o'clock that same day, she told her she was
only come to make her excuses to her for not having it
in her power to dine with her as we had company at
home, (there were two or three <HI>humble</HI> friends) but
that she would slip out to her for a couple of hours in
the afternoon; she added, that Miss seemed in a good
deal of haste, and took her leave in less than a quar∣ter
of an hour.</P>
<P>Finding I could learn no more from Mrs. B—,
I drove, late as it was, to the milliner's, and took the
pains of climbing up two pair of narrow dirty stairs
to the woman's chamber. I asked her if such a young
lady, describing Miss Arnold's dress and equipage, had
not been at her shop that day? She told me there
had; but that she had not the honour of knowing her;
and that the lady, after having bought some little mat∣ters
of her, had requested that she would let one of
her shop maids call her a hackney-coach, which she
did, and the young lady drove away in it, having
pulled up both the coach windows; but she heard not
to what place the coach-man was directed. I made
her in my presence demand of her servant, whether
she knew the number, or the coach-man? The
wench said she knew neither one nor t'other, having
met the coach by hazard in the street: And this was
all the information I could get, notwithstanding the
infinite trouble I took on the occasion. I am most ex∣ceedingly
vexed that I took the charge of any young
person, with whose disposition I was not better ac∣quainted;
yet I really thought Miss Arnold a modest
good young body; but 'tis plain I was deceived, for
be she where she will, 'ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certain she is gone with her
own inclination, and had concerted her whole plan
before-hand. 'Tis quite an aenigma to me, <HI>with</HI> whom
or <HI>to</HI> whom she can be gone; but I take it for granted,
<PB N="52" REF="227"/>
there is some intrigue in the case, and that following
her sister's example, she means to introduce into the
family some little obscure wretch. Mrs. Arnold may
now see the consequence of breeding her daughters
up in the country. Yet I really pity the poor woman,
for being so unfortunate in her children. As matters
now stand, I suppose neither you nor my lord V—
will think it necessary to stay much longer at Wood∣berry.
Pray present my humble service to his lord∣ship,
and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>Brumpton, <DATE>March 14th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALL's safe; I have her, Falkland; the soft tur∣tle
may beat her wings against her prison walls;
but it will not be in her power to escape. Let me tell
you how it was.—Having received your letter early
yesterday morning, I dispatched that which was in∣closed
for her, by a porter with proper instructions.
He brought back just two lines, to inform Mr. Falk∣land
she would, if possible, see him the next day at
the place appointed, and that she should bring Miss
Audley with her. A note was by the same messenger
brought to my sister, (whom you may suppose she did
not know to be out of town) wherein Miss Arnold told
her she had important business with her, and begged
she would be at home the next day in the forenoon,
when she would call on her.</P>
<P>Having secured my ground thus far, I drove out
this morning to my lodge, leaving a strict charge with
David to be on the watch at home, and when Miss
Arnold called for my sister, if on not finding her in
town she should ask whether a note had not been left
for her the day before? David was to produce the
<PB N="53" REF="228"/>
identical note out of his pocket, (which having been
only wafer'd, I had with ease opened and sealed up
again) and to tell her he would be sure to give it to
Miss Audley, when she came to town, which would
not be for these five or six days. This you see reduced
her friend to go to her rendezvous without her. I or∣dered
my rogue, who you know has the finest simpli∣city
of countenance imaginable, to tell her, if she
should chance to enquire how I did, (which was na∣tural
enough) that I had drove out that morning to
take the air, To <HI>Brumpton,</HI> as he thought he heard me
direct the coach-man, but he could not be positive for
fear of telling a lye. This precaution was necessary,
that she might not be surprized or alarmed at seeing
me receive her at her first coming instead of you.</P>
<P>Every thing happened just as I had foreseen; and
between two and three o'clock, I saw a hackney-coach
driving briskly up to the house. I was ready at the
door to present her my hand; she looked as pale as
ashes, and trembled from head to foot. Oh, Sir Ed∣ward!
was all she could utter. Compose yourself,
dear madam, was all my reply. I supported her up
stairs to the dining-room, for she was scarce able to
walk, and placing her in an easy-chair by the fire, took:
a turn about the room to give her time to recover her∣self.</P>
<P>Where is your friend, Sir? said she, at length, I
now approached her, and with the voice and look of
a suppliant, Prepare yourself, madam; said I, to hear
a story, which though perhaps it may excite your re∣sentment
against me, yet must it turn your juster in∣dignation
against a perfidious man who has betrayed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you. (You know I was not to mince the matter.)
Where is he? cried she, where is Falkland? looking
wildly about her. He is not now here, replied I
Not here? good God! and she started from her
chair: I ventured (putting one knee to the ground)
with a timid action, such as you have seen used by a
poor spurn'd lover in a tragedy, to lay hold on the cor∣ner
of her robe, and gently withheld her from going.
Have patience, dearest madam, and hear what I have
<PB N="54" REF="229"/>
to say. Falkland is no longer worthy of you, he
abandons you, and marries your sister—I could add no
more; for, as if struck by a sudden flash of lightening,
she fell senseless on the carpet. I endeavoured to re∣call
her to life by the ordinary means of chasing her
temples, and throwing water on her face; but to no
purpose; and to own the truth, I thought her soft
eyes were closed for ever. I hastily called up the ma∣tron
and her daughter, and having with their assistance
raised the lifeless beauty, we put her into the arm'd-chair,
and I retired to another room, as the women
proposed cutting her lace, at which operation my bash∣fulness
would not suffer me to be present.</P>
<P>Having brought her to herself, I was summoned
again into the chamber. She had a bottle of salts in
her hand, which she held to her nose, her eyes were
still shut; but on my asking tenderly how she did, she
opened them, and looking earnestly at me, and then
by turns at the two women, Did not some of you tell
me, said she, that they were actually married? Well,
who can help it! Cecilia has eyes and a heart as well
as other people; but then one's own sister, there is
something so mortifying in that! Would not you
think it very hard, Miss? to the young damsel who
stood by her. I perceived she was not perfectly come
to herself, and making a motion to the women, they
withdrew, and I placed myself on a chair beside her,
though at a respectful distance. Endeavour to collect
your spirits, dearest Miss Arnold. I could kill myself
for having been (though unwillingly) the cause of
throwing you into such disorder. But are you sure,
said she, that you have told me truth? for men are so
<HI>very</HI> deceitful—I have Falkland's own word for
it, answered I.—Oh, then he <HI>is</HI> here after all?
said she. He is not, I assure you, madam; he is now
actually at Oxford.—But I tell you, Sir Edward,
I had a letter from him yesterday, and I promised to
meet him here to-day, or else I dreamt so, for every
thing appears very strange to me. 'Tis very true, said
I; he came to town yesterday in order to have a con∣ference
with you. And here, Falkland, did I faith∣fully
<PB N="55" REF="230"/>
acquit myself of my promise to you, describing
you as a man overwhelmed with shame and remorse
for your crime; and concluded with presenting her
the letter, with which I told her you had charged me.
An indignant blush kindled for a moment on her lan∣guid
face, whilst she read; which fading away again
into its former paleness; This is cruel, said she, it
pierces deep; and she shrunk as if she had felt herself
stung by something venomous.</P>
<P>He told me, said I, that you had requested of him
to postpone his marriage—So, then, interrupted she,
with a half smile, you know the whole of my dis∣grace!
Say rather of your injuries, said I, and of
Falkland's baseness, (it was meet that I should abuse
you like a dog); but passionately as he adores your sis∣ter,
he said he found it impossible to obey you; and
as Miss Cecilia had already consented to be his, he was
resolved to press her to the immediate accomplishment
of her promise, depending on the gentleness of your
nature, which he thinks will not suffer you to inter∣pose
your wrongs to divide them. He begged of me
to say every thing that I could in ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enuation of his
fault; and without listening to the reproaches that I
made him, left me in order to take post immediately
for Oxford. What could I do, proceeded I, soften∣ing
my voice, and preparing to breathe out some ten∣der
things, what, charming Miss Arnold, could I do?
—Alas, she heard me not; a second fainting-fit
had seized the mournful fair. During the time that I
spoke, she fate with her head reclined on one of her
arms, which rested on the elbow of the chair, her
hand covering her eyes partly concealed her face from
me; but the conclusion of my tale again deprived her
of her senses, and it was the dropping of this white
and lifeless arm that advertised me of it.</P>
<P>Again were the women called up, again we had re∣course
to all the female apparatus of hartshorn, hun∣gary-water,
and burnt feathers, for this fit was longer
and more obstinate than the former. At last she came
to herself; but the women found her so extremely fee∣ble,
that without saying any thing to me, (who had
<PB N="56" REF="231"/>
once more withdrawn; observe my punctilio, Falk∣land)
or even consulting Miss Arnold herself, they im∣mediately
undressed her and put her to bed in an ad∣joining
chamber, before she had sufficiently recovered
her recollection to oppose their motions.</P>
<P>Having given the due praise to this their prudent
conduct, I desired them both to attend on the lady
with the utmost care and respect; and if when she
was thoroughly come to herself, she should attempt to
rise in order to go away, that they, through a tender
care of her health, should by no means permit it;
but to calm her uneasiness they were to tell her, that I
(being in the utmost fright and anxiety about her) had
gone to town in the coach which had brought her thi∣ther,
in order to bring a physician, and had charged
them not to let her stir, till I had his opinion whether
she might be removed with safety.</P>
<P>Having thus disposed matters, I drove home in the
aforesaid coach, (which she had retained in order to
bring her back) and in about two hours returned again
accompanied by an able doctor, whom I had brought
to visit the sick lady. One of my trusty guardians met
us in the hall, and taking me aside told me, that the
young lady having recovered herself pretty well soon
after I had gone away, had expressed the utmost sur∣prize
and terror at finding herself in bed in a house
she knew not, demanded where she was? and where
Mr. Falkland and her sister were? to both which ques∣tions
the women having answered her agreeably to the
truth, she desired that her cloaths might be brought to
her, that she might dress herself and go home. They
then told her, according to my instructions, that she
must not think of stirring till the arrival of the doctor,
whom they expected every minute; and that they
could not answer it to their consciences, to let her de∣part
in the weak condition in which she then was,
without his leave. She insisted nevertheless on going;
but a fresh obstacle was represented to her, viz. that
she had no method of conveyance to town. She was
quite out of patience at this, and said she would walk;
but this was treated as an impossibility; for had she
<PB N="57" REF="232"/>
even been in a condition to undertake such a walk, the
roads were so wet and dirty as to make it impractica∣ble;
she knew not a step of the way; they had no
body they could send to conduct her; and they them∣selves,
poor souls, could not leave the house; the mo∣ther
was old and infirm, and the daughter could not
be spared, as she had the care of every thing upon her.
She still continued earnestly asking for her cloaths, that
she might at least get up and dress herself, in order to
be in readiness to return to town with the physician,
whom they said they expected; but this request they
also thought themselves obliged for the lady's good
to refuse; so that partly by entreaties, partly by argu∣ments,
and partly by a little gentle compulsion, they
had still detained her in bed, where she had continued
to talk, and bewail herself without ceasing.</P>
<P>After having received this account, we proceeded to
the chamber of the lady. I kept an aweful distance,
not presuming to appear in sight. The doctor ap∣proached
her bed-side, and desiring permission to feel
her pulse, pronounced her in a fever, and that the
consequence would be fatal, if she ventured to leave
her bed.—He asked her if she felt any pain? She
made him no answer, but pointed with her finger to
her forehead. I thought so, said he, but I shall order
something for you; then charging them that she
should be kept extremely quiet, not suffered to speak
a word, and be made to drink plentifully of balm-tea;
he called for pen, ink; and paper, and sate down to
write his prescription. Whilst he was thus employed,
I ventured to draw near the bed-side, and speaking in
a low voice, I told Miss Arnold, I only waited her
commands, to go to town again in order to acquaint
her friends with her situation; and asked whether she
would not chuse to have lady Sarah Bidulph come to
her, since the doctor was of opinion it might endan∣ger
her life to be removed?</P>
<P>I do indeed find myself, said she, quite unable to
rise; yet I should have made a shift to walk if they
had let me gone at first; but now my strength is quite
exhausted; my head too feels giddy, the chamber
<PB N="58" REF="233"/>
seems to turn round.—Lady Sarah will certainly
attend you when she knows the condition in which
you are; shall I wait on her, madam, for that pur∣pose?
Oh, Sir, do you think she would shew any
compassion to such a cast-away? No, no, she must
not know a word of the matter. For God's sake, Sir,
(joining her hands together, and speaking quite in a
whisper) can't you contrive to have a chair sent to me
here! I may be carried to Mrs. B—'s; I pro∣mised
to go to her this evening.—I perceived she
made this request in a low voice, that the doctor might
not hear her and oppose it; but as it was my interest
that he should, I answered her loud enough to reach
his ears; I will send for a chair immediately, madam;
I think you cannot run any great risque in being car∣ried
to town, provided you are wrapped up warmly.—
The doctor, who had just then finished his prescription,
turning hastily about, What is that you are pleased to
say, Sir, said he, that the lady will run no risque in
being carried to town? I should hope so, Doctor, re∣plied
I, as it is of the utmost importance to her to re∣turn
thither this evening. It she has any thing that
requires her attention that is of more importance to
her than her <HI>life,</HI> said he, 'tis another affair; and in
that case, I don't see any occasion you had to consult
me; but as I look upon her to be in a dangerous way,
having one of those rapid fevers which increase hourly,
you are to take the consequence of removing her upon
yourselves; but I shall expect at least that <HI>my</HI> charac∣ter
will be cleared from any blame that may alight on
it. He then threw his prescription on the table, which
he had held in his hand while he spoke, and left the
room croaking out presages of mortality in case of dis∣obedience
to his orders.</P>
<P>The two women who were present, and who seem∣ed
extremely frightened at what he said, now de∣clared
with one voice, that they would not suffer
the lady to be stirred; to be sure the doctor knew
better than we did, what was proper; and they were
surprized that a gentleman of my sense would offer to
act contrary to his advice. As for the poor lady her∣self,
<PB N="59" REF="234"/>
it was no wonder she did not know what she was
saying, as sickness was so apt to put people out of their
right minds; but for their own parts, they would not
for all they were worth in the world have such a sin to
answer for as the lady's death, which no doubt would
be the consequence of her leaving her bed in the terri∣ble
condition in which she then was.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold, now finding all her hopes of getting
away entirely frustrated, burst into tears: Then I am
lost, said she, exposed, and ruined! I cannot out-live
the shame of having the cause of this illness known.
Have patience, dear madam; I will go to Mrs. B—
to inform her of your situation; your <HI>illness</HI> cannot
be kept a secret, though the <HI>cause</HI> of it may; you
must confide in some one; Mrs. B—is a good
woman, she is your friend.—Sir, I have no friends,
no relations, I am a poor creature abandoned by every
body.—Do not say so, madam; you see a man before
you who would sacrifice his life to serve you.—
Thank you, Sir, thank you; I would be glad to see
Mrs. B—, though I believe she will not come to me.
—I will go to her directly, madam; there is no doubt
but she will attend you. In the mean time be assured
you are in the hands of very careful and very honest
people. I hope in a day or two you will be able to
venture out; in the interim; let me conjure you to
compose your thoughts as much as possible; the re∣establishment
of your health depends chiefly on the
tranquillity of your mind.</P>
<P>I took my leave on this, and making a sign to the
antient matron, she followed me out of the room,
leaving her daughter at the bed-side of the lady. I
asked her what she thought of the real state of our pa∣tient's
health. She said she was certain that the whole
of her disorder arose from the violent agitation of her
mind, and that she believed a good night's rest would
set all to rights again; that she had felt her hand, and
thought her not in the least feverish; on the contrary,
she had found her extremely low; and as her strength
and spirits had been so much, exhausted by her faint∣ing-sits,
she was of opinion that a glass or two of good
<PB N="60" REF="235"/>
wine would be of more service to her than all the
drugs in the apothecary's shop. As I have an implicit
faith in this good woman's skill, I remained perfectly
satisfied with the judgment she had pronounced; and
agreeing with her, that the sickness of the mind was
beyond the power of medicine to reach, I contented
myself with ordering the prudent dame to give the
lady some of her own little innocent cordials, which
she kept for her private drinking, and to pass them on
her for the doctor's prescription.</P>
<P>You will be surprized, perhaps, that after having
already had the advice of an eminent physician, I
thought it necessary to ask that of an old woman. To
account for this part of my conduct, you must know
that this same doctor, though exceedingly skilful in his
way, is not remarkable for his veracity, and in the
case before us had said neither more nor less than what
I dictated to him: In short, it was no other than my
villain David, on whom I had clap'd a large periwig,
and given him a diploma to practise in the present
emergency.</P>
<P>This imaginary indisposition (for there is more of
fancy than reality in it) has been the luckiest thing in
the world, as it has furnished me with a pretence for
detaining her one night at least without having re∣course
to absolute force, which was my original in∣tention;
for my plan was to have set out with her at
midnight, and carried her to my friend Bendishe's house
on Bagshot-heath, whom I have already apprized of
my design. His mother is lately dead, and he is now
king of the castle. Thither do I mean to convey my
prisoner; but I think from the view of things which
I now have, that I shall be able to effect this by strata∣gem,
which I should much prefer to violence for more
reasons than one.</P>
<P>The house in which we are at present, I do not
look upon as a place of security for any long continu∣ance;
for besides its being too near London, there is
more than a chance of her being discovered here by
means of the coachman who drove her down hither;
for though I have endeavoured, by virtue of a good
<PB N="61" REF="236"/>
bribe, to charm the dog's tongue to silence, yet 'tis
natural to suppose the Bidulphs will leave nothing un∣attempted
to find him out; and the same specific of
which I made use to shut his mouth, will infallibly
open it.</P>
<P>'Tis my wish to have it <HI>blazed</HI> abroad that the fair∣one
is in my hands; my only care is to secrete her till
the insolent family shall think themselves happy in find∣ing
her no other than my wife.</P>
<P>Set thy mind at rest, Falkland, with regard to her
health; for be assured her disorder is nothing more
than the natural consequence of that flurry into which
she has been thrown by this day's adventure. Some∣what,
perhaps, may be attributed to the skill with
which the doctor conducted himself: for let a person
be but a little indisposed, and at the same time under
a violent depression of spirits, (which was our case)
and a judicious physician shall be able, at any time, to
persuade them that they are in mortal danger.</P>
<P>To-morrow you shall know how I acquit myself of
my pretended commission to Mrs. B—; but as I
would not keep you in suspence, I shall send this off
directly by Jerry, who is now cracking his whip in the
yard, as I ordered him to attend on purpose for my dis∣patches.
I suppose to-morrow, or next day, you will
have lady Sarah's account of this affair come lagging
in like a jaded horse that was thrown out of the course;
and then we shall have the old house at Woodberry
in such a commotion as you have sometimes seen an
ant's nest. Probably it may retard your nuptials for a
while: but if they wait till the stray'd lamb is reco∣vered,
it will require more patience than can be rea∣sonably
expected in a lover; for I tell thee, Falkland,
that powers terrestrial nor infernal shall not snatch her
from me.</P>
<P>'Tis now eight o'clock, I am supposed by miss
Arnold to be at London. She expects every minute
the arrival of her friend Mrs. B—. I go to put
an end to her expectations, at least for to-night.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>Brumpton, <DATE>March 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE have I been since last night, Falkland,
like a spider spinning my toils, with no other
materials than what my own proper brains furnish me
withal. And my poor little fly, unconscious of the
snare, is now so intangled, that, hopeless of escape,
she has e'en left off struggling.</P>
<P>After I had left her yesterday evening, in order to
wait on Mrs. B—, she remained pretty tranquil, in
hopes of her friend's arrival. Not to keep her, how∣ever,
too long in an uneasy state of uncertainty, I
thought proper, after I had dispatched my letter to
you, to send a note to her by one of the women,
with orders to say she had received it from my ser∣vant;
in which I told her, that Mrs. B—would at∣tend
her the next morning; and that, not thinking it
prudent to allow myself the liberty of seeing her that
night, I chose to write rather than be the bearer of
this message. There was decorum for you! I can
tell you, it had its weight; for she praised my discre∣tion,
at the same time that she expressed herself ex∣ceedingly
grieved and disappointed that Mrs. B—
did not come to her immediately. She remained very
unquiet the whole night, without once closing her
eyes. Sleep, barbarous sleep, forsakes the pillows of
the unfortunate. Gladly would I have watched her
restless couch—but decency forbid it; and I had this
account only from the nymph who passed the night at
her bed-side. About eleven o'clock I thought it ex∣pedient
to make my appearance; and having begged
the savour of an audience, I was admitted into her
chamber. (I must observe here, by the way, that
<PB N="63" REF="238"/>
she had again called for her cloaths, and had intreated
for leave to rise in order to receive me, but was per∣emptorily
refused by her careful nurses; one of them,
however, was commanded to stay in the room). Well,
Sir, said she, with a look of impatience, where is
Mrs. B—? I went to her house, madam, agreeably
to your desire, as soon as I got to town—And won't
she come, Sir? Unfortunately, madam, I could not
see her last night; her maid told me she had been
taken suddenly ill, and was obliged to be put to bed
about an hour before. As I found it would be im∣possible
for her to attend you that night, I did not care
to disturb the poor lady's repose, by informing her of
your situation. It was for the same reason, with re∣gard
to you, (pardon me, dear madam) that I ventur∣ed
to deceive you, by writing you word she would
wait on you this morning. I thought, indeed, I but
anticipated the truth; that I could have answered for
her intentions; and that her disorder, which I hoped
was but some little temporary complaint, would not
have hindered her from fulfilling the promise I had
made in her name. God help me! then I am not to
see her? Is she sick, Sir? or is it that she refuses to
come to the succour of such a poor forlorn wretch? I
made a long pause, then replied, She is <HI>really</HI> ill,
madam—I wish that was the only disagreeable cir∣cumstance
I had to tell you—Another long pause,
with a very troubled countenance—Pray, sir, speak;
have you seen Mrs. B—; I have, madam, I was at
her house again this morning; and having sent up
word that I had important business with her, I was
admitted to her chamber, where I found her in bed;
for she still continued ill. I wait on you, madam,
said I, at the request of Miss Arnold, who, relying on
the friendship you have always had for her, requests to
see you immediately on a very particular occasion—
She cut me short before I had time to proceed—Good
God, cried she, what has the rash girl done! You'll
pardon me, Sir Edward, but I cannot help calling her
so. I know she has not been at home all night. Lady
Sarah Bidulph sent hither, both last night and this
<PB N="64" REF="239"/>
morning, in search of her—I little imagined she had
put herself in your hands!—Then lifting up her eyes,
Poor dear Mrs. Arnold, said she, how much are you
to be pitied! Though I must acknowlege, sir, you
are a more eligible choice than Mr. Falkland. I found
Mrs. B—was possessed with a belief, which, had
it been well founded, would have made me but too
happy. I made haste to undeceive her, assuring her
I was very far from being the fortunate man she sup∣posed
me, and was going to explain the reality of your
situation, when, by the most unlucky chance imagi∣nable,
we were interrupted by the arrival of lady Sarah
Bidulph. She was ushered into the chamber by Mr.
B—himself; so that we had not the least previous
notice of her coming. It seems her anixiety, with re∣gard
to you, madam, had brought her in person to
enquire if Mrs. B—had learned any news of you.
Mr. B—, I suppose, had been told that I was with
his lady, and his curiosity to know the occasion of
this visit had induced him to lead in lady Sarah in that
abrupt manner. We can get no tidings of this un∣fortunate
girl, said lady Sarah, as soon as she entered
the room; dear Mrs. B—have you heard nothing of
her since? Here is a gentleman, madam, said Mrs.
B—, who can give you some account of her. Lady
Sarah turned towards me, and, with a look of aston∣ishment
scarcely to be described, What! Sir <HI>Edward
Audley!</HI> said she; and stopped, looking at Mrs. B—,
as if her amazement had deprived her of she power of
speech. Oh, oh, then I suppose, said Mr. B—, that
the young ladies resolving to keep each other in coun∣tenance,
Miss Arnold has given Sir Edward to your
ladyship for a kinsman. I am very sorry to say, repli∣ed
I, that the lady has not done me that honour. So
much the worse, cried Mr. B—with an oath, (for
the poor man swears sadly;) for if a girl elopes from
her friends, and spends the night the Lord knows
where, unless she can account for it by matrimony,
she'll make but a devilish silly figure when she comes
back. You'll forgive me, madam, for repeating his
words; but you know Mr. B—has a coarse manner
of expressing himself.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="240"/>
I now found myself under such an embarrassment
that I scarce knew what to say. I saw the justification
of your character (dearer to me than any other consi∣deration)
required ray declaring the truth at large;
yet the not having your permission to make any expla∣nations
to lady Sarah Bidulph, checked my tongue;
and before I had time to frame any reply, Pray, where
is the lady? said lady Sarah, if I may take the liber∣ty
of asking. As I thought in this particular any con∣cealment
would be highly improper, I hesitated not to
tell her precisely where you were; adding, that as a
sudden and violent attack of illness had detained you
the whole night, and, as I feared, was still likely to
confine you for some time to your bed, you had beg∣ged
to see Mrs. B—, to whom you would make such
explanations as you hoped, through her mediation,
would induce your friends to pardon a seeming failure
of duty, into which an unexpected event had unwarily
led you. I suppose, answered lady Sarah, that the
young lady, seeing the good effects of her sisterr's fine∣laid
stratagem, intends to play the same farce over
again at Brumpton that Miss Cecilia did at Woodber∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;
and hopes, under a pretence of illness, by getting
her friends about her, to prevail with them as easily
to consent to her whimfies as they have done to those
of her sister. Faith, I am of your ladyship's opinion,
said Mr. B—laughing; but if you would take my
advice, you would e'en let Sir Edward keep her now
he has her. Such faux pas as cannot be mended, are
always best overlooked: and when she appears as lady
Audley, it will be nobody's business to enquire how
it came about. Provoked as I was at the gross man∣ner
in which Mr. B—delivered himself, and still
more at his daring suggestions, I yet endeavoured to
preserve my temper; and too much flattered by the
hitt he had thrown out, pardon me, dearest Miss Ar∣nold,
if for a minute I presumed to entertain a hope
upon which I dare not now enlarge. I contented my∣self,
however, with replying, that I should think my∣self
but too happy to give my name to Miss Arnold,
let that event be brought about by what means it
<PB N="66" REF="241"/>
would. Then addressing myself to lady Sarah, I will
not, madam, said I, take upon me to explain the mo∣tives
of the lady's conduct, which however strange it
may appear, I dare venture to say, she will be able to
justify. Riddle me, riddle me ree cried Mr. B—;
but how, in the name of wonder, came Miss Arnold
to put herself under <HI>your</HI> care, Sir Edward? And how
came it, sir, rejoined lady Sarah, that you did not
acquaint her family last night with her situation?
Perhaps, interposed Mrs. B—, Sir Edward knew not
of it till this morning. Yes, madam, replied I, and
your servants have been careless in not informing you
that I was at your door last night; when being told
that you were not to be seen, I was obliged to defer
the account I had to give you till this morning. As
for the two questions which lady Sarah and Mr. B—
have demanded, I must leave it to Miss Arnold herself
to satisfy them. It is a most unaccountable affair, said
lady Sarah. I suppose, sir, that lady Audley and your
sister are with her. Neither one nor the other, ma∣dam;
unluckily they are both now out of town. Gra∣cious!
exclaimed lady Sarah, and has the girl passed
the whole night in a lonely house, without any one in
it but servants? You cannot think Sir Edward so inat∣tentive
as that comes to, replied Mr. B—, with a sneer,
which indicated a meaning too injurious not to rouze
my utmost resentment; but my tender regard to your
reputation making me fearful of a quarrel, I seemed
not to have attended to him, and only replied to lady
Sarah, that you were in the hands of very worthy and
sober people, who, I was sure, would not be wanting
in the utmost care and respect. Then asking Mrs.
B—if she thought her health would permit her to
pay you the desired visit, as you were not in a conditi∣on
to be removed, she replied, 'Tis impossible, Sir
Edward; I have had a fever on me the whole night,
and find myself unable to list my head from my pi∣llow;
otherwise you may assure yourself nothing
should hinder me from seeing the poor child. But
you, lady Sarah, I make no doubt, will think it ab∣solutely
necessary to go to her immediately. <HI>By no
<PB N="67" REF="242"/>
means,</HI> was her cold and peremptory reply. I expect
Sir George in town to-morrow night; he is the pro∣perest
person to enquire into this business.—Will you
in the mean while, madam▪ send some one you can
trust to visit her? said I; your own woman? I am so
far of Mr. B's mind, answered she, that I think the
less noise there is made about this wretched affair the
better. There is no trusting to the discretion of ser∣vants;
they very often betray secrets, only to let peo∣ple
see they are trusted. A pleasant entertainment it
would be to the town to hear that <HI>my</HI> niece was found
in a little lodging-house at Brumpton! for there is not
a living creature but knows of her being gone off
somewhere in a hackney-coach. It seems, madam,
that lady Sarah discovered this circumstance by having
traced you to a milliner's at whose shop you had been
yesterday. (You must know, Falkland, that Miss
Arnold herself had related this particular, when in
endeavouring to prevail on my women to let her go,
she had, by way of proving the necessity she was un∣der
of returning home, told them of the shifts she had
been obliged to use in getting to Brumpton unknown
to her family.) And my people, continued lady Sarah,
have been to enquire for her at every house in London
where I visit; so that it will be impossible for <HI>me</HI> ever
to think of taking her home again, were she even in∣clined
to return.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. B—sighed, and, seeminly fatigued with
the length of our conversation, I know not what to
make of this unhappy affair, said she; but I will sus∣pend
all judgment till I hear what Miss Arnold has to
say for herself. Mean while let me beg of you, Sir
Edward, that lady Audley or your sister may be sent
for to be with her. Poh, poh, said Mr. B—, the
shortest way, Sir, Edward, will be to trundle her
down to Oxfordshire, and ask blessing of the good
lady her mother. Mrs. Arnold is in a complying hu∣mour.
Why not accept of you for a son-in-law as
well as Falkland? I condescended not to answer Mr.
B—'s ill-timed pleasantry; but applying myself to his
lady, Then, madam, you do not give me any thing
<PB N="68" REF="243"/>
in commission to say to Miss Arnold? Tell her from
me, said Mrs. B—, that nothing shall prevent my go∣ing
to her the moment I am able to leave my bed.
And tell her from <HI>me,</HI> rejoined lady Sarah, that she
may expect a visit from her uncle as soon as he comes
to town. If she can satisfy <HI>him</HI> with regard to her
conduct, I fancy the rest of her friends will excuse her;
mean while, I think her character cannot suffer more
by passing <HI>two</HI> nights under the protection she has
chosen, than it probably has done by staying one.
That matter is settled then, said Mr. B—, rising off
his chair, as if to put me in mind of retiring. I took
the hint, and immediately withdrew, mortified to
death at the unfortunate success of my embassy.</P>
<P>What think you of this little history, Falkland?
Was it not well conceived? and have I not made the
personages talk and act in character? Oh, I know
them all; and you know I have a knack at entering
into the sentiments and expressions of those I would
represent.</P>
<P>I would not break the thread of my narration to tell
you Miss Arnold's comments, which were many,
during my recital. But when I came to that part of
it, <HI>Tell her she may expect a visit from her uncle as soon
at he comes to town!</HI> she clapped her hands together;
Then I am undone! said she. Oh, Sir Edward, what
have you brought me to! Had you suffered me to
have gone home yesterday, all this might have been
saved; it were better I had died a thousand times
than live to be exposed to so much shame! Forgive
me, dear madam, said I, I meant all for the best, tho'
my zeal for you has unfortunately produced such ill
effects. I am, upon your account as much alarmed
as you are at the thoughts of this threatened visit from
Sir George Bidulph; yet how can we prevent it? He
comes, said she, wringing her hands, armed with the
terrors of a judge, to examine the poor little crimi∣nal!
he finds her in an obscure house out of town—
True, madam, (interrupting her) and under the im∣mediate
protection of a man whom, next to Falkland,
be most hates; not a soul with you but people whom
<PB N="69" REF="244"/>
that very man had placed about you; how are we to
account for all this? (Observe the <HI>we,</HI> Falkland; you
see I made myself a party.) Must I undergo the
mortification, said she, of disclosing all my disgrace,
and that to a <HI>man</HI> too? a severe and vindictive relati∣on,
from whom I can expect nothing but reproaches!
no kind friend to mediate or throw in a softening word
in extenuation of my fault!—Oh, Sir Edward, I
cannot stand this dreadful interview.</P>
<P>At all events, madam, said J, Sir George Bidulph
must not see you. His impetuosity might be fatal to
you in the weak condition in which you now are.
Let <HI>me</HI> stand the brunt of his resentment. I care not
for his anger; or at worst—I am ready to sacrifice my
life for you. She knew too well the tendency of my
words, the frightful image of a quarrel between her
uncle and me, ending perhaps in a duel, rushed at
once upon her imagination. Let me go, cried she,
let me hide myself where I may never be heard of
more! Oh, Sir Edward, what miseries have you
brought on me! Why did not you let me go yester∣day?
What recompence can you make me for the loss
of friends and character? Was life to be put in com∣petition
with them? This was the very subject which
I wished should get possession of her mind, and I was
resolved to make it operate with its full force. Let me
conjure you, madam, not to afflict yourself with need∣less
apprehensions; your friends, I hope, will be in
time appeased; and for your character, there <HI>is</HI> a way,
if I durst presume to name it, by which it might be
secured from the smallest shadow of reproach.—
I stopped here, as if afraid to proceed—No, no, sir,
nothing but the grave can screen <HI>me</HI> from reproach.—
Dear Miss Arnold, permit me to tell you, that you
<HI>have</HI> a resource, not, I hope, so desperate, so hateful
to you, as that which you mention. What is it, sir?
for I know of none. To give the man who has un∣fortunately
been the cause of having your character
called in question, a legal right to defend it at his
own. (Was not this hinted with as much delicacy as
lord V—himself could have done it?) Oh, Sir Ed∣ward,
<PB N="70" REF="245"/>
is <HI>this</HI> a time?—I interrupted her; I grant
you, it is not, madam; and I should have too much
respect for your well-founded grief to make such a
proposal, if I did not think it the only means to obviate
what I at least flatter myself is the principal cause of
it. Your friends already suspect that I am particularly
interested in the unfortunate step you have taken. The
manner of your coming hither, of which they are, as
I told you before, thoroughly apprized, has all the ap∣pearance
of a premeditated flight on your side. How
are you then to explain this part of your conduct?
Do you think, madam, it will be considered as a
greater crime by your friends to return <HI>my</HI> love than
that of the ungrateful Falkland? Oh, Sir Edward,
what have you led me into? you have completed my
destruction!—Let me beseech you, madam, to con∣sider
a little how extremely critical your situation is.
What will be the consequence of your confessing the
truth? You doom to despair the unhappy man who
implores your pity and forgiveness—Oh, not for
the universe, she cried; I would die rather than see
him unhappy! You plant a dagger in your poor
Cecilia's heart, and ruin the peace of your whole
family! She breathed a deep sigh, striking her hands
gently on the counterpane of her bed. Then, madam,
think how you are to excuse yourself. Will the in∣tention
be deemed less faulty than the act? It was to
Falkland's infidelity, not to Miss Arnold's awakened
duty, that her family are indebted for her late ac∣knowlegement
of her error. Sir, the thought is e∣nough
to turn one's brain! I am not able to support it.
This is all your doing, Sir Edward; if you had suf∣fered
me to have gone—I acknowlege it, madam,
and would die to repair my mistake, if that would do
it—Let me go, sir, (looking on each side the bed, as
if for her cloaths) let me fly to my mama; she'll ad∣vise
me, she'll give me some comfort in my misery.
Madam, I will not oppose your will, you shall have
my chariot, when you please, to convey you home;
but have you determined what conduct you are to
hold with regard to Mr. Falkland and your sister, sup∣posing
<PB N="71" REF="246"/>
even we should be able to form some pretence
for your having come hither? I will not say a word,
said she, which can prevent their marriage; no, no, I
love them both too well to disturb their happiness,
Charming generous creature! said I; then you will
probably, in a few days, be a witness to the joyful
nuptials of the happy Falkland. Oh, that's too much,
said she, I did not think of it before. I cannot be a
<HI>witness</HI> to them. Lord! what shall I do? I tell you
again Sir Edward, my head is almost turned, and I
am sure I should not preserve my senses if I were to
see my uncle. You shall not see him, madam; nei∣ther
do I think it adviseable for you to trust to the
strength of your own resolution in being present at your
sister's marriage, which must unavoidably be the case
if you go down to Oxfordshire. Suppose, instead of
a journey thither, you were to retire to some friend's
house, and wait there till after Mr. Falkland's de∣parture
from England, which will take place immedi∣ately
after his marriage. You will, in the interim,
have time to consider of what is best to be done to ex∣tricate
yourself from the difficulties in which you are
entangled. I am sorry, added I, that neither my
mother nor my sister are in town, as it prevents me
from offering you their house as an asylum. I thank
you, sir, said she, but I will go to Mrs. B—'s; she
is the woman in the world whom, next to my mama,
I most revere. I am extremely mortified, my dear
Miss Arnold, said I, that I am now under a necessity
of telling you what for fear of giving you pain, I chose
before to conceal; but I doubt it will be impossible
for you to be at Mrs, B—'s.—Mercy on me!
why so, Sir Edward? I am sure Mrs. B—loves me,
and would do any thing to serve me. I am satisfied
of <HI>her</HI> kind intentions, replied I, but can you answer
for those of her husband? I know he is a rough man,
said Miss Arnold; yet I think he would not hinder
his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from giving shelter to a poor unfortunate crea∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,
who has no other friend to whom she can fly.
You judge too favourably of him, answered, I; for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen his lady was lamenting that it was not in her
<PB N="72" REF="247"/>
power to attend you on account of her illness, he e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣plied,
You need not make yourself uneasy about that,
Mrs. B—; for were you even able to go, I should by
no means approve of your interfering in a business of
this nature. Leave the lady to the conduct of her
own relations; and let me request it of you, not to
interpose one way or other. You may judge by this,
madam, whether Mr. B—'s doors are likely to be
open to you. What will become of me! cried she.
I have then no resource left—Oh, Sir Edward Aud∣ley,
into what an abyss have you plunged me!—
I will send for my mother and my sister directly, ma∣dam,
they are only at Hampton-Court; they can ea∣sily
be in town to-night. I am sure they will joyfully
receive you. Mrs. Arnold has a great regard for lady
Audley; she can have no objection to your being with
her—True, sir; but <HI>why</HI> am I to be with lady Aud∣ley?
Why not go home to my mama? What reason
can I offer for that? That your health would not per∣mit
you to take the journey; and finding Mr. B—'s
doors shut against you, and that you had incurred the
resentment of lady Sarah, you had no other alterna∣tive.
—And here a thought has just struck me, by
which you may very naturally account for your com∣ing
hither in the private manner that you did. You
know your uncle Bidulph has thought proper to forbid
any connection between you and my family, at the
same time that neither he nor lady Sarah are strangers
to the friendship that subsists between you and my
sister. Now, madam, why may it not be supposed
that you had been prevailed on, from the love you bear
Miss Audley, at her earnest request, to meet her here?
The fear of having a thing (interdicted by Sir George)
discovered, is a sufficient reason for the precautions of
which you made use; and the sudden and violent
illness which attacked you here rendering it impossible
to be concealed, obliged you to have recourse to Mrs.
B—, as you had not the courage to apply to lady
Sarah herself, after such a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>palpable breach of your
uncle's commands. We may leave it to Sophy,
continued I, smiling, to frame an excuse for her
<PB N="73" REF="248"/>
having desired to see you in this clandestine manner.
Perhaps a stolen wedding was intended, to which you
were to have been a witness; and which I happening
to discover, prevented, and sent my sister directly into
the country. I dare say she will not scruple at invent∣ing
an innocent tale for your service; and if you will,
for once, condescend to give your sufferage to a slight
deviation from fact, in order to prevent such compli∣cated
mischiefs as a discovery of the real state of the
case would produce, I think there will be no difficulty
in gaining credit to so plausible an account.</P>
<P>You see, Falkland, with what cautious terms I dres∣sed
the falshood that I was suggesting to her, and how
much I avoided, giving it the appearance of a lye, that
terrible naughty thing, which being the single crime
that little children can commit, the avoiding; it is the
first moral principle that is inculcated into them, and
which sometimes sticks by them their whole lives; as
was the case with Miss Arnold; for, notwithstanding
all my gilding and varnishing, she discovered the face
of the ugly phantom.—Lord, said she, what, a despi∣cable
creature have I made myself, to be reduced thus
to such mean shifts! My dear madam, of two evils we
must always chuse the least. True, said she, yet were
<HI>I</HI> only to be the sufferer, I would not submit to the
telling a falshood; but when I think of—
She stopped short, striking her forehead with one of
her hands.—Oh, Lear, Lear, whispered I to myself,
beat at this gate that let the folly in, &amp;c. Well, ma∣dam,
I think we have at length found an harmless ex∣pedient,
by which we may be delivered from our dif∣ficulties.
I will immediately dispatch a messenger to
Hampton-court to request the presence of the two
ladies in town to night. Mean while let me conjure
you to endeavor to take a little repose, I am sure you
stand in need of it; you may depend on seeing my
mother and sister by supper-time. I was going to
leave the room. Hold, Sir! cried she: you may save
yourself the trouble of writing to lady Audley, and
her the inconvenience of hurrying to town, for I am
now determined to go home to my mama. Since I am
<PB N="74" REF="249"/>
reduced so low as to be under an absolute necessity of
telling a falshood, I may as well do it at once without
aggravating my fault by absenting myself longer from
my family, and exposing my character to any farther
censures. I know the worst that can befall me at
home, and will try to support it; therefore, if you
would oblige me, furnish me with the means of get∣ting
immediately to Woodberry; I am able enough to
undertake the journey; I would set out directly.—</P>
<P>This was just what I expected. I had for this very
purpose furnished her with a plausible tale, of which,
spite of her love of truth, I knew she would make
use, rather than continue any longer in a situation
which, it must be confessed, was not the most e∣ligible.
You will ask perhaps, why I did not take her
at her word, and under pretence of sending her to
Woodbery, lay hold of this opportunity of conveying
her to Bagshot? I'll tell you, because I knew I could
do it as well to-morrow, or even the next day. And
you are to observe that as soon as she should find her∣self
carried to a different place from that where she ex∣pected
to go, I must drop the mask at once, and I
think it more for my interest to wear it a little longer.
I hope to make a sort of merit with her of my respect∣ful
and distant behaviour during the time I have had
her so intirely in my power. A merit, let me tell
you, not to be overlooked in a man so <HI>desperately</HI> in
love as I am. And then my running away with her
was not a premeditated scheme; no, no, it was sud∣denly
suggested to me by the violence of my passion,
on finding her determined to put herself into the hands
of a family from whom I could expect no quarter.
This you see softens the trespass down to a mere love
transport, and will much sooner obtain forgiveness than
could possibly be expected for a concerted scheme. So
that, in short, I now begin to think I shall have less
difficulty to prevail with her than I at first apprehend∣ed.
By the bye, she has been extremely courteous to
me, and expresses herself very thankfully for all the
trouble I have taken to serve her.</P>
<P>You are not to wonder then, that I endeavoured to
<PB N="75" REF="250"/>
turn her from her design of setting out directly, as she
said she would for Oxfordshire. I would not for the
whole earth, madam, said I, dispute your pleasure in
any thing; but let me conjure you to have a little more
regard to your health than to think of undertaking
such a journey, till you have at least, by one night's
repose, in some measure recruited your strength.
The women who attend you, tell me you slept not
last night, you have taken no refreshment since you
have been here, you must be extremely feeble; let me
prevail with you—She interrupted me, Sir, I find my∣self
much better than I was; I am not indeed quite
well, yet I think I am strong enough to undertake such
a little journey. You will much oblige me if you will
furnish me with the means of setting out immedi∣ately.
—But, madam, consider, Sir George Bidulph is
still at Woodberry; your sudden appearance there, as
it must surprize him extremely, so must it put him
upon enquiring into the motives of it, and force you
into disagreeable explanations.—This seemed to startle
her; I would not wish to meet my uncle, said she,
yet he will hear the whole affair from lady Sarah as
soon as he comes to town, and in how terrible a light
must I appear till he has it explained! Leave it to your
mama, said I, to explain it to him; Mrs. Arnold will
hear you with indulgence, and represent the story in
the tenderest manner to Sir George. I had much ra∣ther
it were so, replied she. Yet the staying in this
house another night, with absolute strangers—'tis so
improper, so imprudent! better risque any thing.—I
put her in mind of what lady Sarah had said, that her
character would not receive any more injury (in case
even of the affair's being known) by staying two than
one night in the place where she then was.—She seemed
half inclined, yet loath to yield; when lifting her
modest eyes to my face, I shall be permitted then, Sir,
said she, to remain here with no other company but the
two gentlewomen of the house? I understood her
meaning; Undoubtedly, madam, replied I, I shall re∣turn
to town directly. I would not for the world alarm
you by my presence. And to-morrow you will be so
<PB N="76" REF="251"/>
good as to let me have your chariot, Sir? Certainly,
madam.—I retired immediately; but instead of going
to London, only withdrew into another chamber,
where I sate me down to give you this farther account
of my proceedings. I mean not to leave the house to∣night,
for I would have it <HI>published</HI> that I have not
lain at home, since the day of elopement.</P>
<P>I intended to have sent this off to you to-night, but
upon second thoughts will defer it till to-morrow, when
I may have something farther worth communicating to
you. I am just now told that the lady is risen, and
has requested a dish of tea, which is the first nourish∣ment
the perverse beauty would receive, as she has only
been prevailed on since yesterday noon to wet her lips
once or twice with a little wine and water.</P>
<P><DATE>March 16th.</DATE></P>
<P>We have just had the prettiest altercation imagina∣ble,
but it is all blown over, and we are now the best
friends in the world. The lady rose at eight o'clock this
morning, though as the damsel, who lay on a pallet by
her, informed me, she slept very little more last night
than she had done the night before. Her first enquiry
was, whether the chariot was arrived? She was an∣swered,
No. She complained, was fullen, and would
eat no breakfast; a common practice it is with ladies,
when they are vexed, to fast out of spite. I heard
her (for I was in the chamber adjoining to her's) tra∣versing
her room all the morning; then speaking to
the women who were with her. 'Twas very hard, she
said; sure Sir Edward Audley would not break his
word with her! By no means, my dear creature, whis∣pered
I to myself; but you must nevertheless restrain
your impatience, for it is not at all convenient that you
should set out so early. About twelve o'clock I sent
up to desire permission to ask her how she did; and
was immediately admitted. Her countenance cleared
up when she saw me. Oh, Sir Edward, I was afraid
you had quite forgot me! I enquired after her health.
She scarce allowed herself time to answer me—Is the
<PB N="77" REF="252"/>
chariot come, Sir? for I have been ready these three
hours. I am rejoiced to see you so much better, ma∣dam;
but to tell you the truth, I so little expected to
find you so well recovered, that I would not order the
chariot till I first knew whether you were in a conditi∣tion
to travel—Bless me, Sir, how can you disap∣point
one so! I am very well, extremely well. What
carriage brought you down hither? I'll take <HI>any</HI> ve∣hicle
—I care not what it is. Madam, I rid; I gene∣rally
take a ride every morning. (I was booted.) Well,
Sir, let me beseech you, it you <HI>mean</HI> to favour me
with your assistance, to let your servant go to town di∣rectly
and order down your chariot, or hire me ano∣ther
coach. I will go myself, madam; I am now re∣turning
home, I did not think it had been so late; but
a circumstance has occurred to my thoughts this morn∣ing,
which makes me wish you would defer your jour∣ney
for to-day.—Indeed, Sir, I will not defer it—
(rather in a peevish tone for so gentle a creature) Ma∣dam,
I presume not to dictate to you; but I would
just remind you that as your uncle Bidulph is expected
in town to-night, should you set out for Oxfordshire,
'tis highly probable you may meet him on the road;
and how disagreeable such a rencounter would be to
you, is worth your consideration.—I would not meet
him on any account, said she; yet if the windows of
my carriage are drawn up, I think there will be no
difficulty in concealing myself. Do not trust to that,
madam; you know you must stop on the road, you
may happen even at the same inn to pop on each other.
What would Sir George think of such a flight? for
though he may not yet be apprized of what has hap∣pened,
yet the seeing me with you—She took me
up short; Sir, there is no necessity for that; I shall
think myself sufficiently obliged to you for one of your
servants to conduct me home. I found by this, the
ungrateful little gipsey, notwithstanding all my kind∣ness
to her, had no thoughts of making me any re∣turn;
but I was prepared for this refusal. I see, ma∣dam,
said I, how unacceptable all my services are to
you; that shall not, however, prevent my doing my
<PB N="78" REF="253"/>
utmost to oblige you. I go, madam, to fulfil your or∣ders.
My chariot shall attend you; it probably can∣not
be with you in less than about a couple of hours;
but be under no anixety. You must necessarily sleep
on the road to-night; I suppose it will be a matter of
indifference to you whether you lie twenty or thirty
miles out of town. 'Tis quite equal to me. said she;
yet had you been so good as to have let me depart early
this morning, I might have slept at Woodberry to∣night.
I begged pardon for my omission, and as a
farther precaution to hide herself from Sir George Bi∣dulph's
sight, I recommended it to her not to alight out
of the chariot when the horses came to be changed.
She said she would not alight till she came to the inn
where she was to lie; and thanked me for the hint, the
the intention of which I believe I not explain to you.</P>
<P>Thus having restored tranquillity to the breast of
my fair, I withdrew; but instead of going to town
myself, I dispatched my imp to order the chariot down
at <HI>three</HI> o'clock, and not before; this will cost us an∣other
hour of fretting, but no matter: Charmer, thou
must bear greater disappointments than that; I have
directed at the same time my sister's maid to make up a
little packet of her young lady's linen, and some other
necessaries, and put them into the coach box; see how
provident I am, Falkland.</P>
<P>You will desire to know perhaps how I meant to act
in case Miss Arnold had consented to have gone to my
mother's house? Why, just as I mean now to act. I
did not lie awake spinning such flimzy toils as were to
be brushed away by the white finger of a baby. My
mother was to have been very ill, not able to come to
town, and alarmed to the last degree at the thoughts
of how much a young creature's character might suf∣fer
by being alone under the care of a giddy boy like
me. She conjures her to come down directly to Hamp∣ton-court,
where her cousin Batemans would be re∣joiced
to receive her. She sets out for this purpose,
and then the business is done, let me but get her out of
London in a vehicle of which I govern the motions.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="254"/>
You are to observe, that never having but once
gone the road from Oxford to London, she nows kno∣thing
of the geography of the country. Besides, the
fear of meeting our uncle Bidulph will make her afraid
to peep her nose out. The horses are to be changed
at Hounslow; but as she sets out with mine, and a
good coachman, you know, having too much regard
to his master's cattle to drive them like post-horses, she
must be content to go to the first ten or dozen miles at
a very moderate pace; after which, as ill luck would
have it, one of the fore wheels failing, we are all of a
sudden obliged to stop; by this time, by my calculati∣on,
it will be near dark; the footman, or coachman, no
matter which, steps into a gentleman's house before
whose door the accident happened, to get a hammer
and nails, careless blockhead as he is to forget such
necessary implements on a journey. This is the cue for
Harry Bendish (at whose house David has arrived be∣fore
this present writing) to make his appearance. He
entreats the the lady to step in whilst her chariot is re∣pairing.
The coachman having by this time dexter∣ously
applied the hammer, the wheel is in <HI>reality</HI> put
out of condition of rolling, and the lady reduced to
the necessity of accepting, of a bed at this hospitable
gentleman's house. And where is Audley to be all
this while? why, on horse back, close upon the track
of the chariot; and as soon as his prey is housed, as if
touched with the spear of Ithuriel, he starts up in his
own proper shape—</P>
<P>Bravissimo, the chariot is this minute arrived; I am
supposed to have come down in it in order to bid Miss
Arnold adieu.—Farewel, inexorable fair; but—
I'll met thee at Philippi.—</P>

Dear Sidney,
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 17th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have just discovered in what manner your daugh∣ter
has disposed of herself, and suppose it will a∣maze
you as much as it has done me, when I tell you
she has thought proper to make choice of Sir Edward
Audley. The gentleman, I presume, finding himself
unacceptable to one sister, addressed himself with bet∣ter
success to the other. This, as lady Sarah observes,
is the consequence of that weak indulgence which has
been shewn to Cecilia. These events have overturned
all my views, and I find I am to look for heirs <HI>out</HI> of my
own family.</P>
<P>From the lights, that had been got before my arrival
in town, Mr. B—judged that the shortest way to
come at the discovery of this affair, would be by ad∣vertisement
to offer a reward to the coachman who
carried a young lady on such a day and hour from such
a place; and accordingly, at lady Sarah's desire, he
put such an advertisement into all the papers yesterday.
The fellow came to me this morning, and declared he
had carried the lady so described to Spring-garden pas∣sage,
where she alighted and walked towards the Park;
but that he knew no more of her. With this unsatis∣factory
account, I own I should have been put off;
when lord V—, who very luckily happened to be with
me, and whose thoughts were more disengaged than
mine, suspecting the fellow did not speak truth, pro∣posed
bringing him before a magistrate. The man
seemed frightened and unwilling to go; which con∣firming
my lord in his suspicions, we threatened sending
him to prison. Upon which he acknowleged that he
had carried the lady to a house at Brumpton, which he
said he was ready to shew us; where, after having set
her down, a gentleman whom he did not then know,
but whom he found afterwards to be Sir Edward Aud∣ley,
<PB N="81" REF="256"/>
came in his coach to town; that he drove him to
his house in Bond-street, where he gave him five gui∣neas,
with a strict charge, in case of enquiry, not to
own that he had carried such a lady, threatening to be
the death of him if he disobeyed him. Having secur∣ed
the man till farther enquiry, I went immediately to
lady Audley's house, where I was informed that she
and her daughter had been at Hampton-Court for these
ten days past. As for Sir Edward, the servants could
give no account of him, but that he had been out of
town since Thursday; but where they knew not. Not
being able, to obtain any farther information from them.
I drove to Brumpton; here I had the mystery explain∣ed
by the old beldam who keeps the house. She said
Sir Edward Audley had lodgings in her house, which
he kept the year round; and where, being but a <HI>puny</HI>
gentleman, he sometimes lay for his health. That on
Thursday a young lady had met him, that she suppos∣ed
was either his wife or his <HI>sweetheart;</HI> but that it
was none of her business to enquire. That they passed
the whole day together; and that the lady had lain
there that night. I asked if Sir Edward had slept with
her; the assured me that he did not, the lady having
been so much indisposed that her daughter had been o∣bliged
to sit up with her all night, and that Sir Edward
had lain in another chamber; but that the next day
they both went away together in Sir Edward's chariot;
but to what place she could not say. I asked her se∣veral
questions to try if I could entrap her in her an∣swers;
but she replied readily, and with seeming truth,
to all my interrogations; and concluded with declaring
solemnly she knew not who the lady was; but that she
made no doubt but that she either was, or would be
married to his <HI>honour.</HI> This is the sum of what I have
heen able to gather; and as I concluded with my land∣lady
of Brumpton, that the lady <HI>is</HI> by this time mar∣ried
to his honour, I do not mean to give myself any
farther pain about her. As for your daughter Cecilia,
I have nothing more to say, than as you are entirely at
liberty with regard to the <HI>time</HI> of her nuptials, I am
only commissioned from lady Sarah to tell you, that
<PB N="82" REF="257"/>
she begs to be excused from being present at them; and
I must request the same favour with regard to my∣self.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.
P. S. Though such disagreeable news as this letter
contains would reach you full soon enough by the
post, yet to put an end to so uncomfortable a state
as that of suspence, I shall send it by an express.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 17th,</DATE>
eight o'clock at night.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not been composed enough to write to you,
Audley, till this day. My thoughts have been all
tumult. Your exploit, as you may well imagine, threw
all the family into the utmost consternation. Lady
Sarah's account reached them but twelve hours later
than your's did me; for though she writ not till the
day after Miss Arnold's departure, she trusted not to the
conveyance of the post. My Cecilia was drowned in
tears; Mrs. Arnold almost stupified with grief; the
good old Price lifting up his hands and eyes in astonish∣ment;
Sir George Bidulph execrating the art and dis∣simulation
of women, and muttering ungrateful hints
to poor Cecilia. I, traitor as I am, seeming—
no, Audley, not <HI>seeming;</HI> but really taking part in the
general uneasiness; and lord V—. (What a slave am
I in comparison of that man!) endeavouring to console
us all. Sir George and his lordship set out for London
the next morning, in order, if possible, to discover the
bottom of this dark affair, not one of them being able
to form a single conjecture which could throw the least
light on it. What a dreadful interval have I endured
<PB N="83" REF="258"/>
from the time of Sir George's quitting us till now! I
would not for millions pass eight and forty hours more
in the same manner. You are to know, that since my
last to you I had pleaded my cause so successfully, that
I had prevailed on Cecilia to consent to our marriage
before my departure. Mr. Price, who is ever on his
pupil's side, had worked on Mrs. Arnold. Lord V—
was so generous as to join them both, and they had all
together so wrought on Sir George Bidulph, that he at
last consented, provided we were married privately, and
the affair kept secret till my return; when it was pro∣posed
to procure for me such a rank in the army, as
would somewhat better intitle me to the honour of this
alliance. Oh, the pomp of Bidulph blood! In short,
the wedding-day was fixed for the twenty-second of
this month, and I was to depart for Germany on the
thirtieth, for so it had been originally determined by
lord V—; and Sir George made this a preliminary to
his hard wrung concession. He agreed, however, to
be present at the ceremony, on condition that lady Sa∣rah
could be persuaded to come down. Lord V—and
he were to go to town in order to prevail on her if <HI>pos∣sible</HI>
to condescend so far; but at all events Miss Arnold
was to be sent for on the occasion.</P>
<P>Thus were matters determined, when this heavy
unexpected blow fell upon us, and seemed to over∣whelm
the whole family, even the very servants, with
affliction. One would have thought that Love him∣self
had been scared from this mansion of sorrow.
Cecilia could not listen to his soothing voice, while her
mind continued under such terrible apprehensions for
her sister's fate; and shall I own it to you, Sir Edward,
I felt such pangs of remorse, that had it not been too
late, I would have given up all and dared to have been
honest.</P>
<P>There were some passages in both your letters that
plucked my very heart-strings. Oh, Audley, do I
deserve to be beloved as Miss Arnold loves me! <HI>She
would not say a word to hinder my marriage, she would
die rather than see me unhappy!</HI> How I could curse
thee, thou barbarian, who couldst be proof against the
<PB N="84" REF="259"/>
tears, the swoonings, the tender complaints of this
amiable unfortunate girl! But why should I blame
thee? am not I myself the cause, the wicked cause of
all her distress? Yet take heed, take heed how you
treat her; if she yields herself to your wishes, I will
endeavour to be as happy as my guilt will let me; but
if you have recourse to violence, remember how I
closed my last letter—that's all.—</P>
<P>I am just now returned from Woodberry, where I
read a letter that Mrs. Arnold received from Sir George
this evening, wherein he tells her the following parti∣culars:
[Mr. Falkland here gives his friend the sub∣stance
of Sir George Bidulph's last letter.] This eclair∣cissement
has given quite a new face to our affairs.
Mrs. Arnold, though by no means charmed with her
son-in-law, yet being relieved from a state of the ut∣most
uncertainty, and the most alarming fears, is be∣come
much more tranquil. When one apprehends the
very worst that <HI>can</HI> happen, one is even happy to find
it not <HI>quite</HI> so bad, though still bad enough in conscience;
wherefore Mrs. Arnold, after having expressed her ad∣miration
at Dolly's <HI>amazing</HI> conduct, comforted herself
with the hope, that possibly Sir Edward Audley might
turn out a so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erer man than he now promised to be,
as he was the son of so <HI>very</HI> good a woman.</P>
<P>She then tenderly reproached Cecilia, telling her she
had made a precedent which she (Mrs. Arnold) could
not tell how to defend herself from following; viz.
that of granting forgiveness to one sister as well as the
other. There's comfort for you, Audley! As for
Cecilia, after a thousand pretty exclamations of won∣der,
she concluded with saying, her sister was very sly,
for she had never she least suspicion of her liking Sir
Edward. I whispered to her, Your sister may retort
the same reproach on you, my sweet Cecilia. She
gave me a little pat on the cheek, then said, she had
indeed often observed that her sister was particularly
fond of Miss Audley; that she sometimes fancied there
were secrets between them; that she even <HI>lately</HI> had
suspected that Dolly's heart was touched; but by
whom she could not conceive. I breathed a conscious
<PB N="85" REF="260"/>
sigh! Mr. Price said he was glad the affair was cleared
up, though it was by no means in so desirable a man∣ner
as was to be wished.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold then demanded of me, if I were not
in the secret of your love for her daughter? This
was a home push; but I parried it as well as I could,
by telling her I had looked upon you to be so general
a lover that I did not believe there had been any thing
serious in your attachment to Miss Arnold, though I
had often heard you declare yourself her admirer.
Cecilia laughed; Then he only <HI>pretended</HI> to admire me,
said she. I'll assure you, if I had thought that I was
addressed only for a blind, I would have used Sir Ed∣ward
a thousand times worse than I did.</P>
<P>Having canvassed over the first part of Sir George's
letter, the conclusion, in which <HI>I</HI> was most interested,
came next on the tapis; and here you may be sure I
did not fail to lay hold on that paragraph wherein he
says, <HI>“You are intirely at liberty with regard to the time
of Cecilia's nuptials.”</HI> I hope then, madam, said I, ad∣dressing
Mrs. Arnold, that this event will not make any
change with regard to my happy day? I don't see
why it should, said Mr. Price; you find, madam, Sir
George does not seem to expect it should; and since
neither he nor lady Sarah intend to favour you with
their company, and this affair has deprived you of that
of Miss Arnold, the marriage may be conducted with
still more privacy, for I suppose, unless it be Mrs.
Askham, you will not think it necessary to invite any
one. I mean to have no one else present, replied Mrs.
Arnold, except one or two of our own people. The
day then stands as it did, Audley, the day for my tran∣slation
to the skies; for I think I shall look down on
those poor mortals called kings and emperors, when I
can call Cecilia <HI>mine.</HI> Mr. Price is to join our hands,
by favour of a special licence, in Mrs. Arnold's own
house. Happy Woodberry! what a different aspect
dost thou now wear to what thou didst when I first
quitted thy hospitable roof, uncertain, fearful, almost
hopeless of my Cecilia's love! Yet I cannot be perfect∣ly
at ease till I hear that you are happy in the posses∣sion
<PB N="86" REF="261"/>
of Miss Arnold, with her <HI>own consent.</HI> Your wishes
once accomplished, I shall have nothing to fear; and I
think in her present entangled situation it would be
madness in her ro refuse you.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
[The letter to which this is an answer does not ap∣pear:
and a former letter from Sir Edward to his
sister, in which he gives her a brief account of
his adventure with Miss Arnold to the morning of
that day on which he carried her off, is omit∣ted.]
<DATELINE>Bagshot, <DATE>March 17th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHY, what a barbarous little termagant art
thou, Sophy, to rate thy poor brother so un∣mercifully
for a harmless piece of knight-errantry? I
looked for commendation and applause, and instead of
that you stop my mouth with, “<HI>'Tis downright villainy
in you, brother!</HI>” Why, 'tis downright cruelty in
you, sister, to say so. Where is the villainy of seizing
the prey for which I have been so long spreading my
toils? watching with a patience which exceeded that
of Job himself; rising up early and going to bed late;
passing whole nights without sleep; dispatching cou∣riers
from day to day; wearing my poor pens to the
stumps; and killing all the post-horses between this
and Oxford: and now that I have fairly hunted the
little shy animal into my net, I am to be called names,
and that by you too, recreant varlet as you are, who
originally helped to lime the twigs which we spread to
catch the timorous bird! Oh, fy, fy, Sophy! I did
not expect this from you. Yet after all I forgive you,
child; your indignation on this occasion is natural, and
not only pardonable but even commendable; for, li∣bertine
as I am, I should hate the woman who allowed
herself to think as freely as I do; and should despise
<PB N="87" REF="262"/>
even you if you did not feel on the present occasion
precisely as you do.</P>
<P>You thank your stars, you say, that you had no
hand in this last stroke of my mischievous politics. You
may thank your stars as much as you please; but you
are nevertheless more obliged to me than you are to
them, who might, if I had pleased, have led you into
the scrape in spite of all the stars in the hemisphere:
but I avoided it on purpose; for though I am an ex∣travagant
fellow, I would not have my <HI>sister</HI> so far un∣sex
herself as to have been aiding and assisting in so
bold an enterprize as this is. As far as a simple love∣plot
goes, I know you are excellent; but a stroke of
this nature exceeds thy feeble abilities, and is worthy
only of myself. I commend your prudence, and the
reasons that you give for not informing my mother of
the affair. Let her be innocent at least of <HI>this</HI> offence;
for however pleased she might be at the bottom with
my succefs, it will be for her credit to be ignorant of
the means I have used to accomplish it.</P>
<P>As for yourself, my Sophy, though I am <HI>sure</HI> you
are very angry with me, yet am I sure also your curio∣sity
is such that you would give one of your white
teeth to know what is now passing here. I will gratify
you therefore at less expence; and to be as minute as
you can desire, I will take up the thread of my narra∣tion
just where I broke it off in my last. [<HI>Sir Edward
here tells his sister the manner in which Miss Arnold was
carried to the house of Mr. Bendish, which as it had
been preconcerted, was exactly as he had before de∣scribed
it to Mr. Falkland. He then proceeds:</HI>] Miss
Arnold could not be prevailed on to alight, till be∣ing
assured by the servants that it would be impos∣sible
to repair the wheel without taking it off the
chariot, and that even then it would require a con∣siderable
time to set it to rights; she at last vouch∣safed
to give her hand to Bendish, who led her out
with wonderful ceremony. By the bye, I believe she
was the first modest woman (his own mother ex∣cepted)
whom he had ever approached.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="263"/>
Just in that juncture (for I had fallen behind a
little on purpose, did I ride up to the door in full
gallop, calling out to know what was the matter!
I immediately lit off my horse, and addressing Miss
Arnold, who was in the utmost astonishment at see∣ing
me, I told her in two words that as I could not
think of trusting her only to the care of servants, I
had, spite of her prohibition, ventured to follow the
chariot on horseback; that my horse happening to
have a shoe loose, I had stopped for a few minutes
to get it fastened, which occasioned my not being with
her when the accident of the wheel happened. I then
gravely saluted Mr. Bendish as a gentleman with whom
I was not acquainted, and thanking him for his obliging
assistance, followed him and Miss Arnold into the
house.</P>
<P>We were shewn into his best parlour, or as old dame
Bendish used to call it, her drawing-room; where the
blockhead over-shooting the mark, had a tea-table set
out with every thing ready to make tea and coffee. I
could have buffeted him for this piece of ill-timed at∣tention,
which looked too premeditated; and I took it
into my head at that minute to let my fair-one enjoy
one night of undisturbed repose, before I opened to
her the book of fate wherein her destiny was written.</P>
<P>As you know the character of Harry Bendish, tho'
you have not the happiness to be personally acquainted
with him, I believe you will think Miss Arnold was not
under the most sanctified roof in England, and that the
conversation and manners of her host would rather
shock a woman of delicacy; but you are mistaken, for
my friend Harry acquitted himself to a miracle, consi∣dering
how little he had been accustomed to the com∣pany
of, not <HI>ladies,</HI> but <HI>gentlewomen.</HI> The worst of
it was, that being thrown out of his bias, he scarce
knew what to say; and though he by no means wants
parts, yet not daring to enter on his usual topics, he
seemed rather deficient in common sense; and in avoid∣ing
to be thought a rake, he hardly escaped being con∣sidered
as a fool. He told Miss Arnold, that having
had the misfortune to bury his mother (the best old
<PB N="89" REF="264"/>
gentlewoman in the world) about three weeks ago, he
was not so happy as to have any lady in the house;
and therefore desired to know if she would permit his
housekeeper to come in and make tea. Then turning
to me, She is a devilish handsome wench, I can tell
you, Au—I gave him a look that would have pe∣trified
Medusa herself, and arrested my own name,
which was just popping out of his mouth. He turned
it off with an Augh—and two or three coughs.
By the greatest good luck imaginable, Miss Arnold did
not distinctly hear what he said, as he was seated next
to me; and she at the opposite side of the fire. I re∣peated,
If she be as <HI>handy</HI> a wench as you say, sir, I
believe she had best come in and do the honours of
your tea-table. He rang the bell, though not recover∣ed
from his confusion, and ordered one of the servants
to send in the housekeeper; but was answered that she
was gone very ill to bed. I am sorry for it, said he;
for she was such a favourite of my mother's, that since
<HI>her</HI> death I have put the care of my house intirely into
this good body's hands. Miss Arnold was then re∣quested
to take the trouble of making tea herself; which
she did.</P>
<P>We were informed, in about half an hour, that the
wheel was <HI>unmendable;</HI> it was made of unseasoned
wood; the coach-maker was the greatest rogue in
Christendom; and finally, there was no proceeding
without a new wheel, which could not be procured
that night. Miss Arnold looked mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified and dejected.
Our friend said, he was very sorry he had not a car∣riage
to offer her; if he were master of a coach-and-six,
it should be at her service; but as the matter stood,
he hoped she would accept of a bed at his house. I
thought it proper here to close in with the proposal;
and thanking the gentleman for his politeness, I told
Miss Arnold she could not do otherwise than accept of
his obliging offer, as we were six miles from an inn.
She seemed not to relish the scheme; but having no
other choice to make, she was obliged to acquiesce. She
complained of being fatigued, and somewhat indisposed,
and said she should beg leave to retire as soon as a cham∣ber
<PB N="90" REF="265"/>
could be got ready for her. Upon which a cham∣ber-maid
was called, and ordered to conduct her to the
apartment which before had been allotted to her. You
may be sure the servants had their lessons; so that she
was not likely to discover that night into what part of
the world she was got.</P>
<P>Poor Bendish, who had been under a cruel restraint
in her presence, swore he never was so embarrassed in
his life; but being now at liberty, we enjoyed ourselves
over our bottle till midnight.</P>
<P>When I rose this morning, being informed the lady
was already up, I went down to the parlour, where I
found her. After the first civilities were over, she beg∣ged
of me to enquire if the carriage was ready. She
said she was impatient to be gone; for though she was
much obliged to the gentleman of the house for his
hospitality, yet as she thought herself in a very impro∣per
situation, she could not leave it too soon.</P>
<P>It was now time, Sophy, to confess my crime; and
as I had nothing for it but to brazen it out, I approach∣ed
her with an assured air, and requested of her to be
seated till she heard what I had to say. She obeyed me
but by halves; for without sitting down, Well, sir,
said she, <HI>what</HI> have you to say? That I cannot think
of parting with you, madam, now, that chance has
so luckily thrown you into my possession—Not think of
parting with me! what do you mean, Sir Edward?
'Tis time, madam, to undeceive you; you are not on
your road to Woodberry, but in another part of the
country, and in the house of a particular friend of mine,
whither I have led you, on purpose to secure to my∣self
the happiness of seeing and conversing with you;
a liberty in which I knew I should not be indulged if
I restored you to your family. You cannot be serious,
Sir Edward, 'tis impossible. Am I not at Beaconsfield?
By no means, madam, you are on Bagshot-heath, and
in the house of my most intimate acquaintance. Mercy
on me, what <HI>will</HI> become of me! Be not alarmed,
madam, I entertain not a thought with regard to you
that is not dictated by the most respectful love. Re∣spect!
Oh, Sir Edward, do you call it <HI>respect</HI> to betray
<PB N="91" REF="266"/>
me in this cruel manner? You must blame yourself,
madam; your own coldness, your own unkind diffi∣dence
of me, which has urged me to this extremity. I
own I have deceived you, and have nothing to plead
in my excuse but a desperate passion.—I offered
to conduct you to my mother's, under whose care and
protection you might have remained till it was more
convenient for you to return home. You refused the
asylum of her house. Cruel creature! I saw too plain∣ly
the cause of your refusal. 'Twas I, I was the ob∣ject
from whom you would have flown. I afterwards
begged your permission to attend you home; but even
this favour I was denied, and you chose to abandon
yourself alone to the hazards of a journey, rather than
allow me even this small mark of distinction. Then it
was (and nor before) that love inspired me with this
stratagem to detain a perverse beauty, who I found
preferred still in her heart the ungrateful, the perfi∣dious
man who so flag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antly had deceived her, to the
tender, the <HI>honest</HI> lover, who adored her with a sin∣cerity
not easy to be met with in our sex. I gave this
latter part of my speech that sort of tone which indig∣nant
truth assumes, when it would defend its own
rights. I thought, replied my captive, that the incli∣nation
you once professed for me, had been quite sub∣dued.
I fairly owned the state of my heart to your sister,
and you yourself were not ignorant of my unfor∣tunate
attachment to another person. True, madam,
and it was on that account that I gave up my hopes;
yet pardon me if I add, and I think I may without va∣nity
say, that <HI>my</HI> pretensions would, in the eyes of the
world, have appeared better founded than those of
Falkland. Yet I sacrificed all to friendship: let Falk∣land
himself bear me witness that the name of <HI>rival</HI>
was lost in that of friend. Nay, I went farther, and
by trying to acquire a relish for other charms, endea∣voured
to root yours out of my heart; but my strug∣gles
were in vain, and at the time when I offered in∣cense
to your sister's beauty, I found myself in the con∣dition
of those feigned apostates, who whilst they bow
down to a false worship, in their hearts still adore the
<PB N="92" REF="267"/>
true divinity. Yes, madam, I have been faithful to
you, from the moment I professed myself your lover;
and though I ceased to importune, I ceased not to ad∣mire
you. Yet had Falkland been just, you should ne∣ver
have known me for any other than your friend; his
infidelity, I own, renewed my wishes, and the accident
which has now put you into my hands, has even en∣couraged
my hopes.—What hopes do you then
entertain? said she, with a countenance on which was
painted more of terror than of any other passion. That
you will make me happy, said I, by giving me your
hand.—What here, sir? Now! now in this strange
house? I do not say that, madam; if you will pro∣mise
faithfully to be mine, I will conduct you home.
I am sure I can rely upon your word. I have some
little claim to your consideration. Will you, madam,
make me the promise I demand? (I knew she would
not.) I cannot, Sir Edward, indeed I cannot. I never
will marry, assure yourself I never will marry. But,
dear madam, why so strange, so cruel a resolution? A
lady in the pride of youth and loveliness to devote her∣self
to a single life! 'Tis doing injustice to mankind;
if you find <HI>one</HI> lover false, are the rest of his sex to
suffer for that? Oh, Sir, all men are alike, I believe;
I will trust none of them. There are, indeed, but too
many of us faulty, answered I; yet assuredly, dear
Miss Arnold, your censure is too general. It may be
so, sir; but the only two in whom I have confided,
have betrayed me. The faults which <HI>love</HI> commits
against the object beloved, merit not so harsh an epi∣thet;
'tis the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes only of cool infidelity which de∣serve
the name of treason. She made me no answer,
but springing lightly to the window which looked into
the fore-court, I thought, said she, I heard a carriage,
and was in hopes it was the chariot; for, after all, I
believe you only want to terrify me. If that was your
design, you have but too well succeeded; you <HI>have</HI>
terrified me, sir, exceedingly terrified me. To say the
truth, the poor girl shook like a leaf, and was obliged
to sit down in the window to support herself.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="268"/>
The noise she heard in the court, and which she took
for the chariot, was nothing more than a little market-cart,
which was used to carry home provisions, and
which now arrived filled with neeessaries for the house;
and on its entering the court, she observed one of the
servants look the gate and take the key out. This ac∣tion
seemed to deprive her almost of her reason. She
cast a frantic look at me, What, fir, am I a prisoner
then? Am I to be detained here by force? No, no,
I must not suffer this, starting up from her seat. I
drew near her, and ventured to lay hold of her hand.
Let me go, sir; let me be gone from hence this minute.
Whither would you go, madam? Home, home;
whither should I go but home to my mama! Unkind,
said I, 'tis to Falkland you would fly, not to your ma∣ma;
but remember he is now perhaps the husband of
Cecilia.—What have I done to you, cried she, that
you treat me thus inhumanly? A flood of tears suc∣ceeded
her words. 'Tis a trite observation, that no∣thing
affects a man so much as weeping beauty. I now
felt the truth of it, and was really so touched at her
tears, that I fell on my knees before her, and said as
many tenderly extravagant things as if I had been ac∣tually
over head and ears in love; but the obdurate
fair was not to be moved. Let me be gone, sir, let
me go home to my mama, was the burden of her
song. But think of the consequences, madam, think
of your reputation; 'tis already known that you have
passed two nights in my lodgings.—In <HI>your</HI> lodgings,
sir! Yes, madam, those apartments in which you
spent two nights at Brumpton are mine; it will be
known that you left them in my chariot, and that I ac∣companied
you out of town, and that at a time too
when you expected to receive a visit from your uncle.
It will be known that, instead of returning home, you
retired to the house of my particular friend, a single
man, no lady to bear you company, and that I attend∣ed
you hither: what must the world think of all this,
madam? Will it not naturally conclude me to be al∣ready
possessed of that happy title to which I aspire?
<PB N="94" REF="269"/>
And will it not be more for your honour, permit me to
say, for the honour of your family too, to give proof
to this natural conclusion, than by undeceiving people,
to leave them at liberty to judge (pardon me, if I pre∣sume
to say) perhaps very unfavourably of your con∣duct?
She wrung her hands with all the marks of the
bitterest anguish. I endeavoured to sooth her. Some∣times
I implored her pity, and in the humblest language
beseeched her to grant me the return I desired; then
again I represented to her the precipice on which she
stood. This last idea seemed to strike her with horror,
and I really thought, more than once, that she gave
some indications of a situation of mind too alarming to
name; yet I hope 'tis nothing but her extreme sensibili∣ty,
and that after those first violent struggles are
over, reason and discretion will reassume their em∣pire;
and that finding she has no other party to
choose, she will condescend to be lady Audley, with
no other stain than what matrimony will wipe out,
that of running away with her lover, rather than
continue Miss Arnold with an indelible blot on her
reputation.</P>
<P>Bendish entered the parlour during our conversa∣tion,
or rather during my harangue, for I could ob∣tain
no answer from her. She just cast her eyes at
him as he entered, and withdrew them again with∣out
speaking, or even returning his salute. He seem∣ed
abashed, and as if at a loss how to address her;
when, after hoping she rested well, and saying it was
very cold weather, he called for coffee, for we had not
yet breakfasted. Miss Arnold remained in sullen silence,
nor could be prevailed on to touch any thing. How
wilful are you women, Sophy! I'll be hanged, if this
pretty stubborn creature would scruple, with all her
piety, to starve herself, rather than yield to the vir∣tuous
passion of an honest fellow like me. You would
have smiled had you seen Bendish's aukward attempts
to put the lady in good humour; for he, who only
understood the affected coyness of a sempstress, was in
<PB N="95" REF="270"/>
hopes that at least half of Miss Arnold's reserve was
grimace. He told her, if she loved fox-hunting, he
could mount her as well as any woman in England. She
made him no reply, I am sorry to see you so grave,
madam; I hope no part of my behaviour has offended
you. Sir, I am a stranger to <HI>you,</HI> I have no right to
your friendship; yet it is cruel in you to enter into a
conspiracy against a poor young person that never in∣jured
you. I am a helpless creature myself; but I
have some friends that—She stopped herself short at
this word, and hung down her head, as if stung with
the bitter recollection of having lost her protectors;
then added, I <HI>thought</HI> I had some friends; but now I
remember I have lost them. You have a friend in Sir
Edward, replied Bendish, that will make you amends
for them all; take my word for it, madam, he will
make you the best husband in the world—But,
sir, I do not mean to be his wife. Was not this pro∣voking,
Sophy? And she spoke it with as cool a com∣posure
as if she had been her own mistress. You will
think better of it, I hope, madam; I flattered myself
that I should have found less difficulty in persuading
you to a step, which I think the only one that can save
your reputation. Ay, madam, think of that, said my
friend Bendish; a lady's reputation is all in all: and, by
my—I gave him a horrible frown, to stop the oath
that I saw ready to slip out; for I had already for∣bid
him to swear before her. He swallowed it, and
hemming two or three times; And, upon my word,
said he, considering the bad hands—I was afraid
he was going again to blunder, in exposing, perhaps,
his own character as well as mine;—Ay, said I, inter∣rupting
him, considering the bad hands into which a
young lady may fall in this wicked world, once she
has forfeited the esteem of her family, she cannot too
soon put herself under the protection of a husband. I
hope Miss Arnold will consider this. I shall give you,
madam, all the reasonable time you can desire for re∣flection;
<PB N="96" REF="271"/>
but be assured I will not part with the bles∣sing
which my lucky stars have so unexpectedly thrown
into my possession. You <HI>must</HI> be mine, madam; I
would rather owe my felicity to your own voluntary
condescension; yet once we are united, I will trust to
your gratitude for a return to my tenderness. Miss
Arnold made no reply. She seemed absorbed in her
own thoughts. Ay, ay, said Bendish, love will come
after; you cannot chuse a worthier fellow than Sir Ed∣ward
Audley. What say you, madam? when shall
we send for the parson? I long, of all things, to dance
at a wedding. I do not find myself in a condition to
argue with you, replied the lady. May I be allowed
to retire into another room? You command here, ma∣dam,
said I; you are at liberty to do as you please
<HI>within</HI> these walls; and from the moment that you
confer on me the happiest of titles, you may dispose
of <HI>me</HI> too as you think proper.</P>
<P>She rose off her seat, and, without vouchsafing me
an answer, left the parlour, and ran up stairs; and we
heard her bolt the door of the chamber wherein she
had slept the night before.</P>
<P>Bendish said he would go and order his housekeeper
to attend her; adding, it would be for my interest that
she should converse with her; for she was a very sen∣sible
woman, and would try to persuade her to rea∣son.
In hopes, therefore, of some good effects from
this conversation, I intruded not on her for the rest of
the morning.</P>
<P>We heard no more of her till dinner-time; when she
was humbly intreated to honour us with her company.
She sent her compliments to Mr. Bendish, and said, she
would take it as a favour if he would excuse her com∣ing
down, as she did not find herself very well. De∣termined
as I was to give her as little room as possible
to complain of my behaviour, I sent her word she
might consider herself as at home; for that she should
be obeyed in every thing: and we sent her up three
or four plates of the nicest things that were at table.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="272"/>
The chamber-maid who attended her said, that she
scarce touched any thing, and seemed very melancho∣ly.
Sweet obstinacy! but I hope to find her in better
humour to-morrow. I asked my friend Harry, why
his housekeeper did not stay to keep her company, and
endeavour to divert her? He said she had been with
her for some time in the morning; but he believed
the lady did not much like her company: for it seems
the blockhead had been so imprudent as to desire this
woman to hint something to Miss Arnold (in case of
her persisting in her refusal to marry me) which, I
assure you, was very far from my thought, and which
none but such a graceless dog as Bendish would have
insinuated. I swore at him heartily for it; but he
called me a dolt, and said I should see better effects
from this little threat than all my cringing would pro∣duce
in a twelve month. And saith, I begin to be∣lieve
him; for in the afternoon, to my great astonish∣ment,
the goddess, of her own accord, descended to
the parlour, neatly dressed with some of the spoils of
your wardrobe, which had been left for her in her
chamber. Her vouchsasing to put them on is a good
sign, you will say. She made a cold apology for not
coming to dinner; but said she now found herself some∣thing
better. I see there is nothing like making you
women afraid of us; for a man who is feared, is
surer of <HI>civil</HI> treatment, at least, than he who is be∣loved:
it is the nature of the little ungrateful sex!</P>
<P>Bendish gave me an intelligent nod and a wink when
she entered the room, as much as to say, Who's in the
right, you or I? She sat down, at our humble request;
but it was visible that she put a violent constraint on
herself in granting us this favour. I thought it not
advisable to urge my suit at that juncture. I have
gained some ground, and hope a few days prudent
reflection on the lady's part, and a little wise manage∣ment
on ours, will induce her, <HI>without</HI> compulsion,
to consent to my wishes. The conversation, for half
an hour, was extremely stupid. Bendish talked of
the improvements he intended to make in his great
<PB N="98" REF="273"/>
old fashioned house, not one of which had either any
meaning in themselves, or any reality in the intention.
I affected to sigh often, gazed at the fair, and now
and then threw in a word, such as, Ay, that will in∣deed
be pretty—Oh, it will be much better so.—Miss
Arnold seemed to give little heed to either of us, but
appeared still buried in her own gloomy reflections.
How childish was all this! Would it not be better
since she knows she <HI>must</HI> yield, to do it frankly, lest I
should hereafter retaliate her coldness, and she should,
in her turn, find herself obliged to become a wooer?</P>
<P>At last, in a pause of silence, I ventured gently to
lay hold of her hand, and, with a soft voice, whis∣pered
to her, I hope the result of my dear Miss Ar∣nold's
deep meditations will not turn out unfavourably
for me. She started, as if awakened from a reverie,
whilst her lilly hand, like the sensitive plant, shrunk
from my touch; and with a look of terror, mingled
with an apparent fear of disobliging me, she as it were
stole the hand from me that I had still followed and
held. Then rising from her chair, Sir Edward, said
she, excuse me for the present, my thoughts are too
much disordered to talk with you; to-morrow, perhaps,
I may be better able to speak. I bowed down to her
shoe-tie, kissing at the same time, whether she would
or no, the pretty little coy hand that she had with∣drawn
from me. She made Bendish a low curtsie;
but this curtsie was not of the right breed: It proceed∣ed
from the same motive that makes the Indians wor∣ship
the d—l. She immediately quitted the room,
and tripped up stairs again to her own apartment.
Sweet soul! I really am fond of her; and were she
but grateful—But no matter for that, I'll make her
a good husband; for I intend to reform after I am
married. Bendish did not fail to exult on his superior
address in having frightened her into good behaviour,
as he called it.</P>
<P>To-morrow then, Sophy, I may probably know
my fate; that is to say, as far as it depends on a wo∣man's
<HI>will.</HI> Good creature! I hope, for her own
<PB N="99" REF="274"/>
sake, she will not oblige me to make use of my autho∣rity.
I shall have a parson ready, an ancient friend
and ally, who has lately taken orders. Falkland is to
be joined to his Cecilia on Friday the 22d, and, on
that same auspicious day, will I, like a sober and
discreet gentleman, enter into the honourable state of
wedlock. I love these little snug marriages, where
Hymen comes as it were incog. without his tawdry
saffron coloured robe to fleer in people's eyes; and for
his torch, he may clap it into a dark lantern.</P>
<P>I have written you such a volume, that I question
whether I shall be time enough for the post; so you
must content yourself without knowing any farther
particulars of to-night: and for the day of days, I
shall be too much elated to descend to minutenesses;
therefore you are to look for nothing more from me
than an I O, which I will write you in huge capitals,
without adding a single word more.</P>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Miss AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Bagshot, <DATE>March 18th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW blasts upon her! She is gone, fled, vanish∣ed,
out of sight, hearing, and reach! Talk
of man's art! man's dissimulation! Why, we are
lambs, doves, or if there be such things, sucking che∣rubims,
to vile deceitful woman! The smooth little
traitoress, to lull my vigilance to sleep, and even to
sooth my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a time when she was meditating
such a wicked escape! Yet <HI>she</HI> was not the contriver
of it herself; another <HI>she</HI> imp, who is gone off with
her, was at the bottom of the plot The house∣keeper,
she of whose discretion and honesty that fool
Bendish vaunted so much, has <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the instrument of
mischief. Dull idiot that I was, to trust her with a
tee à tete to one of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for, of whose integrity
<PB N="100" REF="275"/>
I was not sure. I suppose she told a pitiful tale, and
this officious gossip, thinking to be better rewarded by
the lady's friends for a breach of trust, than she would
be by her master for her fidelity, took the wise resoluti∣on
to assist and accompany her in her flight.</P>
<P>All we can learn is, that Mrs. Spillman (that is
the name of this cursed woman) sent a note late yes∣terday
evening by a peasant in the neighbourhood to
the master of the post-house at Bagshot, desiring him
to send two of his best horses with a guide to Mr.
Bendish's at four o'clock the next morning, two ladies
being to depart at that hour on an affair of the utmost
consequence. One of the horses was to be furnished
with a side-saddle, the other, on which the guide rid,
was to carry double. The man did as he was direct∣ed;
and this witch having all the keys of the house
in her possession, had nothing to do but to unlock the
doors, and fly with my prey. The outer gate was
found open this morning, and the house-keeper not
appearing at her usual hour, the servants thought she
had gone out early on some business. Miss Arnold
(the sorceress, I cannot name her with patience) was
not missed till nine o'clock, when a maid going to her
chamber, to attend her as she had done the morning
before, knocking at the door, but receiving no an∣swer
after repeated trials, she came to inform her
master, for the door was locked. I ran, from a sort
of foreboding of misfortune, like a fury to her cham∣ber,
and burst the door open. What a legion of ana∣themas
did I then pour out on Bendish and every soul
in his house! But to what purpose was my idle rage?
No one could give any account of the lady nor of
Mrs. Spillman. All we could gather is the account
I have already given you, which I had from the inn-keeper
himself. Neither his servant nor horses are yet
returned; I suppose they are detained to prevent our
knowing what road they took. A needless precaution,
for at the time we discovered their flight, was there a
possibility of overtaking them?</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="276"/>
Sophy, this blow has shook me like an earthquake,
and will be fatal in its consequences. Falkland must be
involved in my ruin, for ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>edly <HI>all</HI> will come to
light. As for the vengeance of the Bidu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phs, I des∣pise
it; the <HI>worst</HI> that can result from it is light to
the prospect I have before me.—This is the IO I

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 19th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JOIN with me in prayer, Cecilia, add your pe∣titions
to mine, that that patience and resignation
to the Supreme Will, which has sustained my youth
though a series of afflictions, forsake me not now in
this hour of new and bitter calamity. My child!—
my poor Dolly—</P>
<P>There—I have wept, and now I'll try to tell you;
yet I fear it will shock you too much.—The poor child
is—indeed I believe, my dear, her reason is im∣paired.
She is returned home to me; what a piteous
spectacle? yet I bless Heaven that she has escaped the
dreadful snare that was laid for her.</P>
<P>This day about noon my daughter Cecilia and I
were sitting together in the parlour, when we saw a
plain kind of a chaise, such as some of our farmers
have, drive up to the door. Two women step'd out
of it. We heard Miss Arnold's name pronounced by
one of the servants, as if in an exclamation of sur∣prize
and joy; the parlour door was suddenly thrown
open, and my poor dear girl ran in, followed by a pretty
looking young woman, plainly, but neatly dressed.
My child flew to me, and clasping her arms round
my neck, let herself sink on my bosom; where she
<PB N="102" REF="277"/>
remained without speaking a word. The abruptness
of her entry, accompanied as she was by a stranger,
joined to the idea of her conduct which then appear∣ed
to me so faulty, equally shocked and offended me.
I had not, however, the immediate power to recollect
myself; but quickly recovering from my surprize, I
disengaged myself from her embrace, and putting her
from me with my hand, I was going to speak, harshly,
I believe it would have been; but she prevented me.
—Will you not receive me, mama? said she. Whi∣ther
then must I fly for refuge! Nor you, Cecilia?
(looking eagerly at her sister, who, checked by my
example, had not ventured to approach her) do <HI>you</HI>
cast me off too? Perhaps you do not know me; I
think indeed I am sadly altered with the terrors I have
undergone for I don't know how long; yet indeed I
am your sister. This gentlewoman here can tell you
what I hive suffered; if it had not been for her,
I don't know what they would have done with me—
killed me, I suppose; for I never, never would have
married Sir Edward Audley.</P>
<P>You may judge, my dear, how I was alarmed at
hearing her talk thus. The young woman, who had
hitherto stood silent, but who appeared extremely af∣fected,
now addressed herself to me, and with great
modesty apologized for having so rudely broke in upon
me. My design, madam, said she, was to have re∣quested
the honour of speaking a few words to you
in private, in order to prepare you for seeing Miss
Arnold; but the servant who let us in was so sur∣prized
and overjoyed at the sight of his young lady,
that without giving me time to speak, his impatience
to introduce her made him abruptly throw open the
parlour door, and Miss Arnold entered before it was
in my power to prevent her. Indeed, madam, she
has been cruelly used; yet I bless God for having
been the means of delivering her from the vilest of
men.</P>
<P>My poor girl stood motionless, with her eyes fixed
on me whilst this young person spoke; Cecilia melted
<PB N="103" REF="278"/>
into tears; for my part, I was so overwhelmed with
dreadful apprehensions from what I had just heard,
that without daring to demand an explanation, I could
only express the terror of my mind by broken excla∣mations.
The stranger easily comprehended which
way my fears pointed.—Do not terrify yourself, good
madam, said she; Miss Arnold has received no other
injury than that of being detained against her will,
and brutally urged to marry a wicked man whom
she hates. Had she not escaped his hands, I know not
indeed whether her ruin would not have been by this
time effected.</P>
<P>This declaration having calmed my thoughts a little,
I turned towards my unhappy child; she was now
locked in her sister's arms. Cecilia's face was wet with
tears; she tenderly embraced Dolly, who, without
seeming much affected with her caresses, asked her
why she wept? Are you not happy, my sister? said
she; has your lover forsaken you? No, replied Ce∣cilia,
sobbing, (who then preceived that the poor crea∣ture's
thoughts were wandering) no, my dear, so far
the contrary, that the day is appointed for uniting us
for ever. We all thought that you had been married
to Sir Edward Audley, which made us give up the
hope of having you present at our nuptials.—Fy, fy!
how could you think so? said Dolly; I never loved
Sir Edward, <HI>He</HI> never had my promise. How came
you then to put yourself into his hands, my love? said
I. Oh, mama, do not ask me, she replied, my re∣collection
does not carry me so far back; but I believe
that lady (pointing to the stranger) can tell you. The
young woman shook her head; I'll tell you all I know
of the matter, madam, said she, in a low voice, if you
will allow me the permission of speaking to you alone.
Lead your sister up to your own chamber, my dear,
said I to Cecilia, and try to make her take a little rest;
she seems fatigued, and to stand in great need of repose.
She does indeed, madam, replied the young person▪
for she has scarce closed her eyes these three nights.
My poor child, what have been thy sufferings! Her
<PB N="104" REF="279"/>
sister took her by the hand, Come, my love, will you
come up stairs with me? Whither would you carry
me? cried she, drawing back her hand; ah, Cecilia,
will <HI>you</HI> betray me too? You would send me back to
that vile Sir Audley; but you need not, I will not
disturb your happiness, assure yourself I will not say
a word to grieve you. I could not bear to listen to
her: Take her from me, said I to Cecilia, it kills me
to hear her talk thus. Go, my dearest, endeavour to
get a little sleep; I will come to you in half an hour.
You will not then turn me out of your house, mama?
By no means, my beloved, I am not angry with you,
I want you but to retire to your sister's or your own
apartment to lie down for a little while. Is not there
<HI>one</HI> Orlando, somewhere hereabouts? looking at her
sister with a melancholy smile. Yes, yes, and you
shall see him presently.—Nay, I do not want to see
him, I am only glad to hear that he is alive.—And
poor Mr. Price, is the good man in being yet, for he
was very old the last time I saw him? Cecilia could not
answer her; she again took her by the hand, and
Dolly suffered her to lead her out of the room.</P>
<P>I gave a loose to my tears the moment she was gone;
the young woman wept with me: Oh, madam, what
a mournful sight to see so fine a young creature dis∣ordered
in her mind! I have been apprehensive of
some such thing these two days; but was not certain
of it till now: what pity! but I hope in God she will
come to herself, now she has got back to her friends.</P>
<P>After having dried my eyes, I desired her to relate
to me what she knew with regard to my daughter.</P>
<P>She then told me that she herself was house-keeper
to a Mr. Bendish, who has a house on Bagshot-heath;
that she had been originally hired as a servant to his
mother, a very worthy woman, who having died with∣in
this month, the son, on coming to the possession of
her jointure, of which this seat is a part, had retained
her in the same capacity in which he had found her;
but perceiving he was a young man of very loose
morals, she had determined to quit him.—I was oblig∣ed
<PB N="105" REF="280"/>
to listen to these and a few other unnecessary pre∣liminaries
relative to herself, before she came to that
part of her story which concerned my daughter. I
am entirely ignorant, madam, said she, by what means
Miss Arnold first came into Sir Edward Audley's
hands. She only told me it was by a strange unfortu∣nate
accident; all I know is, that four days ago she
arrived at my master's house late in the evening. She
was alone, in Sir Edward's chariot, which broke (and
as I have since learned, by a contrivance of his) just
before our door. Sir Edward himself had followed
her on horseback. The young lady was quite igno∣rant
of the design; but Mr. Bendish, I am sure, ex∣pected
them, for he had ordered two bed chambers to
be got ready, and a very handsome supper prepared. I
knew not who the expected guests were till after their
arrival, when I heard amongst the servants that the
gentleman was Sir Edward Audley; but they knew not
the lady. I was no sooner told this, continued she,
than I was perfectly convinced there was some base de∣sign
going on, for I was not a stranger to Sir Edward's
principles. The poor creature stopped and wiped her
eyes, into which the tears sprung fast. Are you then
acquainted with Sir Edward, madam? said I. Yes, to
my great sorrow, madam, she replied; I will tell you
my unhappy story another time. I would not then ask
her any questions, and she proceeded. It was my
master's custom to call me into the parlour sometimes
to make tea for his company, when any of them
chose to drink it; but as I was resolved Sir Edward
should not see me, I pretended to be sick that night,
and shut myself up in my own room to avoid appearing:</P>
<P>The next morning my master called me aside, and
ordered me to go into the young lady's room; She is
a perverse silly girl, said he, that Sir Edward Audley
has run away with, and is determined to make her his
wife. If she consents quietly, well and good; if not,
(swearing a vile oath) she may chance to repent her
obstinacy. I know, added he, you women understand
best how to deal with each other; and as I think you
<PB N="106" REF="281"/>
are a discreet sensible girl, I would have you represent
to her the risque she runs of <HI>more</HI> than reputation, if
she refuses to accept of him for a husband. He ad∣ded
to this many other things, and some promises in Sir
Edward's name, to engage me in their unworthy de∣sign;
and I engaged to do as I was directed. I own,
madam, pursued she, that though pity would have in∣duced
me to assist one of my own sex, I had still a
nearer reason for wishing to deliver the young lady
out of her tyrant's hands.</P>
<P>I went immediately to Miss Arnold's chamber; she
unlocked the door on my telling her I was the house∣keeper,
who came to offer her my service. I cannot
express to you, madam, the compassion I felt on seeing
so young and handsome a lady fallen into the hands of
such a profligate. I asked her whether I could be any
assistance to her in dressing? Alas! said she, I have
nothing wherewith to dress myself; I have no cloaths
but what you see on me; I am a poor unfortunate
creature that have been trepanned hither I know not
how. I replied, (by way of founding her disposition)
I understood, madam, that Sir Edward Audley was so
happy as to have your affections, and that you meant
to make him your husband. They deceived you, said
she eagerly; he never had my affections, nor whilst I
have breath (clasping together her hands) will I ever
be his wife. But, madam, you are in his power;
how can you resist, if he should make use of that
power to compell you? He cannot compell me to
<HI>speak,</HI> answered she; nor can I resist if he and the
horrid master of this house are determined on my
death, for that will be the consequence of violence;
but remember I tell you, I am a young person of for∣tune
and condition, and some people may revenge my
death, though they have forsaken me whilst living.</P>
<P>I saw by this, proceeded the young woman, that
the poor lady had been cruelly betrayed, and I
wanted to know no more, to resolve on delivering her
from her persecutor. I took, however, the liberty of
asking her name, if she had no particular reason for
<PB N="107" REF="282"/>
keeping it secret. She informed me of it very
readily, with some other circumstances relative to her
family. Take comfort, madam, said I; I promise to
deliver you safe into your mama's hands before two
days are at an end. She looked at me as if doubtful
of my sincerity. I do not wonder, madam, added I,
that you should mistrust the honesty of every one in
this house; you will find, nevertheless, that I will keep
my word with you. As the keys of the outer doors
are committed to my trust every night, I can with the
greatest ease set you at liberty; it will not be difficult
to provide horses, if you can venture to ride; and
what is more, I will accompany you myself, and see
you safe home.</P>
<P>You look, said she, like an honest young person, yet
you <HI>may</HI> deceive me; but it would be a double crime
in <HI>you</HI> to join with <HI>men</HI> against a poor unhappy crea∣ture
of your own sex. I assured her she might depend
on the truth of what I said. God bless you, said she,
my good young woman. Your virtue shall not be unre∣warded
<HI>here,</HI> no more than it will be hereafter. She even
embraced me, and seemed in an extacy of joy. To
tell you the truth, said she, I had resolved to try if I
could prevail on the chamber-maid, to let me steal out
to-night, when all the family were in bed. I intended
to have offered her all the money I have in my pocket,
and this ring into the bargain (to a handsome diamond
she had on her finger). I was afraid to make the pro∣posal
to you; your appearance, and the station you
hold here, made me think you were not to be cor∣rupted;
but I imagined an ordinary body might be
tempted by such a bribe; and once I got out, I would
have ran till I came to the first house that would have
given me shelter. I told the lady I was very glad she
had no occasion to make the experiment, for besides
the impossibility of any of the servants having it in
their power to let her out of the house at night, she
would have hazarded a discovery of her design, in
having made the proposal of escaping. I then coun∣seled
her to behave less scornfully to Sir Edward, lest
<PB N="108" REF="283"/>
it should provoke him to take any measures that might
frustrate our attempt. I cannot shew him any kind∣ness,
said she, but I will endeavour not to exasperate
him. Perceiving a bundle lying on her table, I open∣ed
it, and found it full of fine linen of all sorts; the
chamber-maid had before told me, she had received
such a parcel out of the chariot which had brought
the lady. I again asked Miss Arnold, would she not
chose to dress? I know not, said she, to whom these
things belong, yet I should like to change my linen,
and since they are here will put them on. I assisted
her; she talked to me all the while, and seemed in
extraordinary spirits; yet I thought now and then she
spoke a little out of the way; but I was at that time
far from suspecting that her head was disordered. I
advised her not to let her joy appear, for fear it should
give suspicions; she promised me she would not, and
having informed her that at four o'clock the next
morning, I should be in readiness to give her liberty
and attend her flight, I left her; taking care for the
rest of the day, (by seigning still not to be well) to
prevent my master from calling me on any pretence
into the parlour.</P>
<P>It was lucky, said I, interrupting her in this place,
that Mr. Bendish did not name you in Sir Edward's
presence; people usually call their house-keepers by
their sur-names, and Sir Edward Audley might pro∣bably
have been alarmed at hearing your's. I had for
a certain reason, madam, said she, changed my name,
when I first hired with old Mrs. Bendish; I called
myself Spillman, but my maiden name is Williams.
You are then married? said I. Her having said her
<HI>maiden</HI> name, suggested this question to me. The
poor thing blushed exceedingly, and answered in a
faltering kind of manner, Yes, madam; but it would
have been happy for me if I never had. Again I
perceived a tear start in her eye; but wiping it off,
she proceeded: I know not what passed between Miss
Arnold and the gentleman for the remainder of that
day; I was only told, that she excused herself from
<PB N="109" REF="284"/>
dining with them, but that in the evening she went
down to the parlour for half an hour, then retired
again to her chamber, where she was suffered to re∣main
undisturbed for the rest of the night.</P>
<P>I took care in the interim to be provided with horses
against the appointed hour; and when all the family
were in bed, I stole softly to Miss Arnold's chamber.
I found her up and dressed. She had even her hood
and gloves on. She ran to me as soon as I entered,
Are we ready to go, my good friend? said she. I
told her it was but little more than midnight; and that
as my master often sat up much later, I had not dared
to order the horses so soon. I could have wished,
madam, said I, that you had continued in bed, that
you might have got a little rest, in order the better to
enable you to undertake your journey. She told me
she had not been in bed at all, having dismissed the
maid who came to wait on her, and made her leave a
candle burning in her chamber. I had no inclination
to sleep, said she, though I do not remember that I
closed my eyes last night.</P>
<P>Her impatience was extreme till the hour of our
departure arrived; and I no sooner told her that the
horses were at the gate (whither she had sent me at
least twenty times before) than clinging to my arm
she rather flew than walked down stairs. We imme∣diately
mounted; Miss Arnold chosing to ride behind
the man, I took the single horse, and cold and dark as
it was, set off joyfully on our journey; but the poor
lady could not divest herself of her fears; she was
every minute apprehensive of being pursued; and
judging Sir Edward Audley would follow her on the
track to Woodberry, she prevailed on her guide, by
the promise of a handsome reward, to strike out of
the high road, and by bye ways make out his journey
to Oxford. I could not pursuade her out of this
whim. The fellow undertook it; but not being well
enough acquainted with the country, he missed his
way, so that after having rid thirty miles without hav∣ing
it in our power to change horses, we found our∣selves
<PB N="110" REF="285"/>
still at the same distance from our journey's
end. Miss Arnold was by this time so extremely
fatigued that she was unable to proceed; her eagerness
to get home was not however abated, and it was with
the utmost difficulty that I persuaded her to stay at the
inn where we then were till this morning, when
the people undertook to procure for us a chaise, and I
promised to set out with her as early as she pleased.
She continued exceedingly pensive and silent all day;
and as I lay in the same room with her, I am sure she
scarcely slept the whole night. She rose, however,
at five o'clock this morning; and notwithstanding the
earnestness she expressed to pursue her journey, she
seemed seized with deep melancholy, and hardly spoke
during the whole time that we travelled.</P>
<P>I thanked Mrs. Spillman as she deserved for the
timely succours she had afforded my dear unhappy
child. It should seem to me, that this is some poor
young person whom that most abandoned of men Sir
Edward Audley has seduced; and probably some
little jealousy, or even remains of love for her betray∣er,
may have mixed themselves with the more chari∣table
motives of her conduct. Be that as it will, my
obligations to her are not the less, Gracious God,
what would have been my state if my daughter had
fallen a victim to the villain's profligacy! But my
mind is easy as to that particular, for she told Mrs.
Spillman that Sir Edward Audley had never in his
whole behaviour towards her exceeded the bounds of
respect. The wretch's views seem rather to have been
on her fortune than her person; for I cannot suffer
myself to believe that either virtue or honour had any
share in restraining his licentiousness. By what wick∣ed
contrivance he first got her into his power, is the in∣explicable
part of the story, for the poor child seems
not now in a condition to inform us. It appears from
all I have learnt, that her first unfortunate step was a
voluntary one; yet who knows what base arts might
have been made use of to ensnare her into it? It is
plain, she had no design of putting herself into this man's
<PB N="111" REF="286"/>
hands; but I must be content to remain in the dark
till she is herself able and willing to clear up the mys∣tery
to me. I dare believe we shall find it a scene of
treachery; at present I will not, by urging her to an
explanation, exasperate the fatal malady which has
laid hold of her, and which this enquiry when I first
made it seemed to aggravate.</P>
<P>I am not of a suspicious nature; yet some things
which my brother threw out when he was here with
regard to lady Audley, joined to this event, has a little
shook the good opinion I had of her. How shocked
should I be to find that either she or her daughter had
any share in this wicked scheme! Yet 'tis not <HI>impos∣sible;</HI>
for I know Dolly was very fond of Miss Aud∣ley.</P>
<P>My daughter Cecilia came in to us again in about an
hour. She said she had persuaded her sister to lie
down, and she was in hopes she had left her in a
slumber; for she had sat the whole time by her bed∣side,
and had not heard her either spake or stir. Sleep,
perhaps, may contribute to settle her poor disturbed
mind. God grant it! yet I dare not indulge myself
in hope; I who now feel the bitterness of being
plunged again into sorrow, at a time when I thought
all the storms of my life were past, must not suffer my
heart to be seduced from its present state of mourn∣ful
submission, by the flattery of my own imaginati∣on.
I have left Cecilia to entertain our new guest,
who, though I know her not, has rendered us services
too important not to merit every mark of friendship
and distinction which 'tis in our power to bestow on
her. She would fain have taken her leave of us; but
I begged of her, if no particular business called her
away to make my house her own, till her affairs were
in a more settled way, than it was probable from the
nature of her situation they could be in at present.
She thanked me with stron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expressions of gratitude;
said she had no other prospect but that of going to
service again; and if I would allow her to remain
<PB N="112" REF="287"/>
in my house till she should find a place to suit her, she
should think herself very happy.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, I am apt to be prepossessed at
first sight; I have taken a liking to this young person,
and if I find no material objection to her character,
should like to take her to supply the place of Nelson,
who is growing so indolent and unwieldy, that she can
but ill discharge the duties of her employment. I do
not mean to part with the poor woman, I think 'tis
time to let her lie by. See how composedly, my
Cecilia, I talk of common matters, whilst I have that
at my heart which weighs me down to the ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland went on a visit this morning to a par∣ticular
friend of his, in order to take his leave, as he
sets out the latter end of next week for Germany.
Friday is the day appointed for his marriage, as I told
you in my last, and he would not after that be willing
to spare so much time from his Cecilia; for the gen∣tleman
whom he is gone to see, lives twelve miles
off, so that we do not expect him home till to-mor∣row.</P>
<P>What a dreadful shock will it be to him, to find
his poor sister in so deplorable a state! Mr. Price thinks
it would be most prudent to conceal, if possible, her
melancholy situation from him, lest he should embroil
himself with that wretched man Sir Edward Audley.
I am entirely of his mind; for who knows what fatal
consequences might follow from Falkland's warmth,
if he should resent as it deserves, and as he certainly
would, this unhappy affair. Yet it will be difficult to
keep from his knowlege that Miss Arnold is returned.
If my poor girl were in a condition to be reasoned with
on that occasion, I am sure she would readily agree to
conceal herself<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the house till after his departure.
The family will then be at liberty to take such mea∣sures
as may be expedient. The laws, I think, on
those occasions are the properest instruments of chas∣tisement;
for I approve not of individuals taking the
rod of vengeance into their own proper hands.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="288"/>
Be so good as to communicate this letter to my
brother, and to lady Sarah. I hope Sir George's sen∣timents
on this subject will agree with those of Mr.
Price and mine. Tell him I would have written to
him, but that I have scarcely strength or spirits to
finish this my long letter to you.</P>
<P>I know, my Cecilia, you will be anxious to learn
every circumstance which passes at this juncture, un∣der
the melancholy roof of your friend; I shall there∣fore
inform you of them as they occur, and as I find
myself able to write. I conclude as I began; join
your prayers with mine, my dear, that it may please
Heaven to restore peace to your disconsolate, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Told you in my letter of yesterday that Mr. Price
and I were of opinion that it would be most ad∣visable
to conceal from Mr. Falkland the knowlege of
my poor daughter's return. Upon consulting Cecilia
on the occasion, we found her exactly of our mind;
it is natural to suppose her tenderness for the man whom
she already looks upon as her husband, would alarm her
fears; yet is she so deeply affected with her sister's situ∣ation,
that she expressed the greatest repugnance at the
thoughts of giving him her hand at so unhappy a
juncture, and urged Mr. Price and me to endeavour to
prevail on Mr. Falkland to postpone his marriage till
after his return to England. We both entered into her
sentiments so far as to agree that this was not a house
for Hymen to revel in; and that it would be impossible,
with so mournful an object in our thoughts, for
any of us to enjoy the satisfaction which would
otherwise result from her nuptials; yet how to ac∣count
for the deferring them was the difficulty. What
<PB N="114" REF="289"/>
pretence could we make to Falkland for so sudden, so
seemingly unreasonable a change in our determinations?
He left us with the certain assurance of seeing his
wishes crowned in three days. What a cruel disap∣pointment
must it then be to him to find all his hopes
overturned; and how could we answer to him such a
flagrant breach of promise? In short, after long can∣vassing
the subject, we found it impossible to acquit
ourselves to Mr. Falkland, without letting him into
the true motives of our conduct; and as that was
the thing of all others we most wished to avoid, we
were obliged to let matters rest as they were, so that
to-morrow remains the day fixed for the wedding.</P>
<P>After having dispatched my letter to you yester∣day,
I returned to the parlour, where I had left Ceci∣lia
and Mrs. Spillman. I found Mr. Price with my
daughter; but the good young woman had begged
leave to be admitted to Miss Arnold's room, that she
might watch by her bed-side till she awoke, for the
poor dear girl was happily then in a profound sleep.
And it was in this interval that we had the conversati∣on
that I have related to you.</P>
<P>The tranquil slumber that the sweet child had now
enjoyed for more than two hours, began to flatter me
with some hope that we might find her in a more set∣tled
state of mind; and in that case we resolved to let
her into our design with regard to concealing her ad∣venture
from Falkland, on which account she would
herself see the necessity of our hiding her from his
sight. But if, on the contrary, we found that her
thoughts continued in the same unhappy frame, we
determined to keep her in her chamber, under pretence
that her uncle Bidulph was come down to look for.
her for Mrs. Spillman had told me that Miss Arnold
had expressed great terrors (she knew not why) at the
thoughts of seeing him, and said she was flying to me
in order to avoid him when she was ensnared to Mr.
Bendish's house. We agreed also to say that Mr.
Falkland was already departed for the army; and
<PB N="115" REF="290"/>
we resolved that Cecilia, Mr. Price, Mrs. Spillman,
and myself, should sit with her alternately till such time
as we should all be at liberty to change our proceed∣ings.</P>
<P>Having thus, in the best manner we could, settled
our measures, and given the necessary orders to the
servants, I desired Mrs. Spillman might be called down
to dine with us. She sent me word that Miss Arnold
was just awakened, and had asked for a dish of choco∣late;
but that if I would allow her to dine in the
young lady's room, she might persuade her to take
something more substantial, as she had eaten very little
for the three last days. I ordered something to be
immediately carried up stairs, and flew myself to the
poor creature's chamber. I found her awake, but still
lying on her bed. She stretched out her hand as soon
as she saw me. I gave her mine. She drew it to her
lips, kissed it several times—but did not speak. How
do you find yourself, my dear? Not quite so ill as I
was, madam, yet I feel myself very feeble. No won∣der,
my child, you have neither slept nor eat for some
days past. I pressed her to take something of what
had been brought up to Mrs. Spillman. She tasted a
little bit; but it seemed in mere complaisance to me,
for she said she had no appetite.</P>
<P>She enquired for her sister. She is below stairs, said
I; she and Mr. Price are at dinner together. She beg∣ged
I would go to them; said she was very sorry I had
disturbed myself to come to her; and that Mrs. Spill∣man
would be so kind as to sit with her till we had
done dinner, when she should be glad to join us in the
parlour. I was delighted to hear her talk so composed∣ly.
I will go down to them, my dear, said I; and
by-and-by we will all attend you in your chamber:
for your spirits seem fatigued, and I would not have
you quit it to-day. As you please for that, madam;
but am I not to see Mr. Falkland? He is not here at
present, my love—Ah, mama! I am afraid all
<PB N="116" REF="291"/>
is not right—Why did poor Cecilia weep to-day,
I believe Falkland has left her. He has not, indeed
Dolly; if your sister wept, it was only at the thoughts
of your sufferings—The dear girl! said she, how kind
that is of her! but I know she loves me. We will
not then, mama, talk of my sufferings, since it gives
her so much uneasiness; pray let them not be men∣tioned
to her or Mr. Falkland; I would not for the
world make them unhappy. How pleased was I to
hear my poor child express herself thus! It was, as
you see, half way meeting our intentions, and spared
me the pain of deceiving her. You judge very right∣ly,
my dear, said I; it would afflict Mr. Falkland be∣yond
measure, if he were to know how you have been
distressed; and perhaps engage him in a quarrel. Ah,
mama, that would be terrible! for God's sake, let him
not know it.—Poor Orlando! I would not hurt
a hair of his head.—Then wringing my hand
tenderly, Pray leave me, mama; you have not dined
yet; you give yourself too much trouble about me.
I dropped a tear of pity, mingled with satisfaction, at
finding her, as I thought, though not recovered, yet
much more calm in her mind, and, to all appearance,
much more reasonable. I left her, and went down
stairs; where I rejoiced the affectionate hearts of Mr.
Price and my Cecilia with the account I gave them of
her.</P>
<P>After dinner we all went up again to her chamber.
She was still lying on her bed; but on Mr. Price's en∣tering,
whom she had not yet seen, she sprung up to
receive him. With what tenderness did the good man
accost her! and how affectionately did she return his
caresses! Mrs. Spillman whispered me, that she had
not spoke a word from the time I left her, but seemed
to be buried in sadness. I told Mr. Price softly that
we must endeavour to divert her, without mentioning
any subject which could make her recur to her own
melancholy thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="292"/>
I believe, my dear, you may remember to have
heard me say that this fine old man has a peculiar
knack at introducing a conversation. Few people
have the art to enter suddenly into any regular series
of discourse without a forced and abrupt, or, at best,
an aukward appearance; yet he is so extremely happy
in his manner, that he can at once engage and interest
you in his subject, without your perceiving how you
had been led into it. He exercised this talent very
successfully on the present occasion, and soon caught
Dolly's attention, who seemed to listen to him with
pleasure. As for Cecilia, she was all ear. I took this
opportunity of beckoning Mrs. Spillman out of the
room, in order to have a little conversation with her.
As it was necessary to conceal <HI>her</HI> from Mr. Falkland's
sight, as well as my daughter, lest the appearance of
a stranger should put him on making any enquiries, I
thought it was proper to apprize her of our design.
After having done this, I told her I hoped she would
excuse my making a prisoner of her in Miss Arnold's
chamber while Mr. Falkland was in the house. She
said nothing could give her greater pleasure than the
being allowed to attend on the young lady. I ob∣served
she coloured at the first mention of Mr. Falk∣land's
name, and seemed very much disconcerted. Af∣ter
I had communicated to her what I had to say with
regard to him, I asked her if she knew him? She
answered, I believe I have seen him, madam; at least
I remember to have seen a gentleman of that name
with Sir Edward Audley, though I did not then know
who he was. 'Tis very likely, replied I; Sir Edward
and he were intimately acquainted. Ah, madam, had
Mr. Falkland known Sir Edward's character, said she,
I think he would have been cautious in forming any
connection with him.</P>
<P>I perceived her heart was open, and that she seem∣ed
inclined to communicate her own story, which she
<PB N="118" REF="293"/>
had promised to relate to me. I expressed some cu∣riosity
to know it, and she told me what follows.</P>
<P>[Mrs. Arnold here briefly gives the substance of this
young woman's unhappy story, with which the reader
is already acquainted in Mr. Main's letters to his sister
Askham. She then proceeds:]</P>
<P>I have given you the purport of this unfortunate
girl's narrative, though in much fewer words than she
employed to relate it. Why, what an accomplished
villain is this Sir Edward Audley! I do not doubt the
truth of what this poor young creature has told me.
The air of candor and simplicity with which she spoke,
and the tears she shed during her recital, convince me
of her veracity. She appealed to Mr. Main (whose
integrity we both know) for the truth of many parti∣culars;
and added, she was sure he was thoroughly
satisfied of her innocence, and the wrongs she had
suffered. What an escape has my poor child had from
this execrable man! and how naturally can Mrs. Spill∣man's
conduct be now accounted for! She said, she
had no hopes of Sir Edward's ever acknowleging her;
yet she owned she could not bear the thoughts of his
marrying another. The account she gave me of her∣self,
has increased my compassion and esteem for her;
yet I cannot think of retaining <HI>lady Audley</HI> (for such she
certainly is) as a servant in my house. I must find out
a more suitable way of shewing her my gratitude. I
asked her, if she thought Mr. Falkland had been any
way privy to the treachery which had been practised
against her? She assured me, that she did not believe
he was; adding, that she supposed Mr. Falkland con∣sidered
her in no other light than that of a woman
kept by Sir Edward Audley. I was very glad to hear
her make this declaration, as it would have given me
a dreadful impression of Falkland, could I have thought
him capable of being an accomplice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so black an af∣fair.
I am not, however, pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was
even so far in his wicked companion's confidence as to
<PB N="119" REF="294"/>
be acquainted with any of his loose secrets. I bless
God that he has not been corrupted by the contagion
of bad example, against which it is so impossible to
guard a young man, once he launches out into the
world. Orlando has been carefully brought up; and
I hope a natural good disposition, co-operating with
a virtuous education, will always prove an antidote
against the poison of vice. I have now double cause
to pray for his continuance in the paths of uprightness
he has hitherto trodden.</P>
<P>On my return to my daughter's chamber, I found
my two children still together. Mr. Price had just
retired to take, as is his custom, his evening's nap.
Dolly was helping Cecilia to sprig some fine muslin
that she is now working for an apron. On my enter∣ing
the room, she ran to me, and whispering me in
the ear, I have not said a word of the matter since,
mama, said she, for fear of making poor Cecilia cry;
I cannot bear to see her tears. I replied, You did
well, my dear; and I have been telling Mrs. Spillman
the precautions we intend to use to keep this whole af∣fair
from Mr. Falkland's knowlege. He leaves us next
week, in order to set out for his regiment; and if, for
the few days that he remains here, you will consent to
keep yourself concealed in your chamber, he need not
know of your being in the house. Oh, with all my
heart, madam, said she, it will be better so; the sight
of me might affect him too much.—Poor Falk∣land!
I would not shock him upon any account. But
when do you expect him here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for I have a notion he
will steal away to the army without seeing any of you.
By no means, my dear, we expect him home to-mor∣row;
for Friday is the day fixed for his marriage with
your sister. Indeed! starting, and looking at Cecilia:
then turning to me, and speaking very low, Do not
believe it, mama, said she: I am certain he does not
mean to marry her till he returns again to England;
for by that time the whole affair will be forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="295"/>
I saw my poor child's imagination, filled with the
idea of her own sufferings, was straying wide from the
purpose of our discourse, and at the same time con∣founding
together circumstances, which were in no∣wise
connected. I was too much affected to be able
to make any answer; and she added, still speaking so
low as that her sister should not hear her, Oh, you do
not know, mama, what dissemblers men are! As near
as you have brought the wedding-day, you will see
Falkland will give you the slip: and she smiled a little;
then added, But I am sure he will have my sister when
he comes back, because he loves her as he does his
life, and there will be nothing then to hinder him.—
Poor dear creature! the villainy of that vile Sir Ed∣ward
has made her distrustful of his whole sex, and
possesses her with a belief that Falkland will deceive
her sister.</P>
<P>We were interrupted just here by the arrival of a
neighbouring lady and her daughter, who came to pass
the evening with us. Cecilia and I were obliged to go
down to receive them, and we left Mrs. Spillman with
Dolly.</P>
<P>The ladies stayed so late, that I saw my poor
daughter but for a few minutes the rest of the evening.
Mrs. Spillman persuaded her to go to bed early, as she
had had so little sleep for some preceding nights. We
have put a little tent-bed into her chamber, in which
this good young body lies. We all breakfasted in her
room this morning. She seems composed, but over∣whelmed
with sadness; and her charming face is so
altered! it almost breaks my heart to look at her.
Cecilia can scarce refrain from tears, even in her pre∣sence.—</P>
<P>They tell me Mr. Falkland is this minute returned.
I will just see him, and then finish my letter. I am
glad of a little relaxation; for I am quite tired with
writing.—</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="296"/>
I found him with his Cecilia. What joy at meeting
again! If a single day's absence has appeared so
grievous, how much are they to be pitied who are so
soon to feel a separation, which may last many,
many tedious months! Nay, heaven knows—but I
will not forebode: 'tis nothing but my own gloomy
thoughts which suggest to me apprehensions, I hope,
without foundation; for does Falkland run any
greater risque than hundreds of other gallant men
who accompany him?</P>
<P>I shall be able to dedicate but little of my time to
my poor girl to-day. Falkland's presence will be a
restraint on Cecilia and me; and we can only see her
by starts.</P>
<P>I intended here to have closed my letter; but upon
second thoughts, I will leave it open till to-morrow,
when I shall have the important article of my daugh∣ter's
marriage to conclude with. It is not the thing
of my choice; yet I hope my children will be happy.
They are both worthy; and for the goods of for∣tune,
they will have more than sufficient.</P>
<P>I endeavour to be chearful, that Falkland may not
have any room to imagine that I repent of having
given a consent, which was indeed wrung from me;
yet my spirits are sadly depressed; and, God knows,
ill disposed to celebrate a festivity so joyful as that of
matrimony <HI>ought</HI> to be.</P>
<P>We are to have no one present at the ceremony but
Mrs. Askham, Nelson, and the butler: for poor
Frederick Hildy would be miserable, if he were not
allowed to see his young master, as he has always
called Mr. Falkland, married to <HI>Madam</HI> Cecilia; for
that is the title which he gives to both my daughters.
These two, therefore, have begged to be admitted
into the chamber, as Mr. Price, you know, is to
perform the office in my house. Adieu then, my
dear, till to-morrow.—</P>
<P>Friday evening, <DATE>March 22d.</DATE></P>
<P>I am writing to you on my knees, Cecilia; for
that posture best becomes one on whom the Almighty
<PB N="122" REF="297"/>
pours out his wrath like a deluge! Yet I will not
ask of Providence why, in the evening of an unhappy
life, not, I think, stained with any peculiar guilt, I
am thus overwhelmed with such tempestuous sor∣rows!
I thought the storm was past; but it re∣doubles
on my head, and I <HI>must</HI> sink under it.—Yet
be comforted, my dear, there is <HI>another</HI> world.
There, there do I look sor recompence for my almost
unprecedented sufferings here.</P>
<P>You will tremble when I tell you, Cecilia, that
Falkland—Oh, God! that boy, whom I have so
tenderly educated, and so dearly loved, that very
Falkland is the viper who now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings me to death!
You cannot credit it, I am sure; but I'll try to recal
my distracted thoughts, so as to enable me to relate
to you what this dreadful day has unravelled.</P>
<P>Dolly had been informed yesterday that Mr. Falk∣land
was returned. She expressed not any desire to
see him; but seemed to have her thoughts extremely
agitated the whole day. Mrs. Spillman asked her the
cause of it, (for Cecilia and I were but little with
her.) Her replies were broken and imperfect; yet
Mrs. Spillman imagined they implied a suspicion that
Falkland would not marry her sister: for she said she
pitied poor Cecilia—yet she must bear her disap∣pointment
for a while—for after the death of a
certain person, there would be nothing to hinder her
nuptials. We attributed this merely to the disorder
of her poor head; little imagining that she had a
fatal reason for talking thus, which she kept con∣cealed
in her heart.</P>
<P>Cecilia thought it would make her easy, if she
were convinced the marriage was really going to be
solemnized. I was of the same opinion: in conse∣quence
of which, this morning, when Cecilia was
dressed in her wedding-cloaths, I led her into her
sister's chamber. You look very pretty, my dear,
said Dolly; white becomes you extremely. Are you
going abroad? (observing her more ornamented than
usual.) You see your sister in her bridal habit, said
I▪ take her by the hand, my love; for she is just
<PB N="123" REF="298"/>
now going to give it away for ever to Mr. Falkland.
Ah, 'tis impossible, mama! said she. I am sure he
does not mean it; though perhaps you have imposed
on him, and he thinks that somebody is already in
their grave. We knew not what to conjecture from
her incoherent words; yet fancied by that <HI>somebody</HI>
she meant Sir Edward Audley, against whom Falk∣land,
believing him dead, no longer entertained any
thoughts of vengeance. This was the idea which,
without having time to reflect, struck me, and, I
believe, entered at the same time into Cecilia's mind.
Oh, how far were we from guessing the true object
at whom the dear unhappy creature pointed! Cecilia
embraced her, to hide her own emotion. Compose
your thoughts, my dear, said she; all your friends
interest themselves equally to make you easy. She
knew not what to say to her. I with difficulty re∣strained
my tears, and thought it best to break away
before I melted quite, lest my disorder should be
observed by Falkland, who was waiting for us in Mr.
Price's study. Come, my Cecilia, said I, we are
expected below stairs; we will return again to Dolly,
after Mr. Price has given you the nuptial blessing.
I took her by the hand; My dear (to Dolly) you will
congratulate your sister presently by the name of Mrs.
Falkland, Dolly made me no reply; but throwing
herself into an arm-chair, seemed for a minute lost in
thought: then lifting up her eyes to heaven, Poor
wretch, said she, what will become of him!—We
referred every thing she said to her own unhappy
adventure; the particular circumstances of which
being ignorant of, we knew not what turn it would
be best to give our replies. Shall I send Mrs. Spill∣man
to you, my dear? said I. She had slipped out of
the room just as we entered, after having spoken a
few words to Dolly, which I did not hear. You
need not, madam, she replied; she said she would
return immediately: she is gone but to put on clean
linen. Poor thing! she confines herself sadly to me.
I had indeed observed that Mrs. Spillman was in
extreme dishabille, being just as she had risen out of
<PB N="124" REF="299"/>
bed. I had given her a closet above stairs to dress
and keep her things in; for she had brought some
cloaths with her. I stepped up to her directly, and
found her combing her hair. Let me beg of you,
my good friend, said I, to hasten down to Miss
Arnold. The poor child must not be lest alone:
her own reflections are but mournful companions.
I did not think, madam, said she, that you would
have made her so short a visit, or I should not have
quitted the room; but I took the opportunity of
your being with her just to slip out for a few mi∣nutes,
in order to make myself a little decent: for I
judged that neither you nor Miss Cecilia could have
much time to spend with her to day; but I will get
my things on as quick as possible, and attend her. I
begged she would; and was returning again to
Dolly's chamber, where I had left Cecilia, when I
met Mrs. Askham in the lobby. She had just come
up stairs. Mr. Falkland is impatient, madam, said
she, smiling, and has sent me to hasten the bride;
and Mr. Price says he will chide her for making them
wait so long. I did not dare to venture my own
firmness again with the sight of my poor child; and
fearful that Falkland himself might take the liberty of
coming to seek her, if she staid any longer, I sent Mrs.
Askham in to lead out Cecilia, and went down stairs
myself; they followed me directly.</P>
<P>We found the good old man in his canonical habit;
Falkland, elegantly dressed, standing by his side.
The agitations of his mind were strongly painted on
his face: I thought then his emotions proceeded
from no other cause but what his present situation
might naturally inspire. Oh, I knew not that a
conscience stained with guilt upbraided him in that
moment of approaching happiness.</P>
<P>Nelson and the butler were the only two servants
that were admitted. I believe, said Mr. Price, rising
and looking at his watch as we entered the room,
that we do not wait for any more company; with
your good leave, madam, we will not delay the
ceremony. I bowed, and all present ranging them∣selves
<PB N="125" REF="300"/>
in the proper order, Mr. Price began the office;
when coming to that part of the exhortation which
says, <HI>I require and charge you both, as you shall answer
it at the dreadful day of judgment when the secrets of
all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know
of any impediment,</HI> &amp;c. which words he pronounced
with that energy which accompanies him in all acts
of devotion, having, by I know not what chance,
cast my eyes at Falkland, I observed he shook from
head to foot; his face was as pale as death, and
I saw he could scarcely support himself on his legs.
I thought he was seized with some sudden illness, and
in my fright was going to interrupt the ceremony, to
ask him how he did, when it was indeed interrupted
in a manner that makes my blood still run cold with
horror! We heard a little bustle at the chamber
door, as if two persons was struggling; it lasted not
an instant, for the door was violently burst open,
and in rushed my dear unfortunate distracted child,
whom Mrs. Spillman in vain had been endeavouring
to hold back. Mr. Price was just then making that
solemn demand of <HI>Wilt thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife?</HI> She gave a piercing shriek, and flying
to Falkland, seized his hand, This hand is <HI>mine,</HI> said
she: Oh, Falkland, you cannot till my eyes are
closed give it to another!—Falkland dropped sense∣less
at her feet.</P>
<P>A general consternation now spread itself through
the little assembled congregation; the servants ran to
the succour of the unhappy wretch who lay extended
on the floor. Dolly still grasping his hand dropped
on her knees by him, then seating herself on the floor,
she laid his head gently on her lap, bathing his face
with her tears. Cecilia stood aghast by their side;
and Mr. Price, with grief and amazement in his
looks, in silence fixed his eyes on this mournful
picture. What were <HI>my</HI> feelings in this dreadful
interval? No, Cecilia, they cannot be described;
my sensations were strange! they were terrible! and
unfelt before! The fatal truth rushed on my ima∣gination
at once, and all my poor child's disjointed
<PB N="126" REF="301"/>
words occurring to my memory, appeared now but
too well explained. She continued weeping over
him, while Mrs. Askham and the servants were
using vain endeavours to recover him. He is dead,
said she, he returns to me no more!—Look,
mama, I have killed your poor Orlando!—Indeed
I did not mean to do so, God knows I would have
given my own life to have preserved his—I thought
but to have saved him from a crime.—I per∣ceived
that Falkland was now coming to himself—
He begins to recover, said I to Mr. Price; perhaps
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sight of these injured faces may make him again
relaple into a fit; let us retire, and leave him to the
care of the servants. Mr. Price, without answering
me, took Cecilia by the hand, and led her out of the
room, Mrs. Spillman and I raised Dolly almost by
force, for she would fain have staid by Falkland,
who now opening his eyes, stared wildly about him
like one awakened from the dead; but we hurried
her out of the room, and almost choaked as she was
with sobs, conducted her to that where Mr. Price
and Cecilia were together.</P>
<P>We let her give a free course to her tears for some
time, in hopes that might lighten the burden of woe
under which her mind had laboured. I was even
pleased to see her weep, it was the first instance she
had shewn since her grievous malady had seized her of
that tender sensibility which was always her cha∣racteristic;
and I was in hopes was an indication of
returning reason, as in effect she soon after appeared
more collected. She had disclosed an important
secret, the concealment of which had so long hung
upon her heart. She had given vent to her sorrow;
and these two circumstances, added to the sudden
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight she had received from the apprehension that
Falkland was dead, had, if not restored her reason,
yet at least called back her recollection.</P>
<P>Having a little composed her by assurances that
Falkland was perfectly come to himself, I thought I
might venture to question her tenderly on the subject
of this amazing event, It seems to me, my dear,
<PB N="127" REF="302"/>
said I, that Falkland has deceived you; was he then
a lover of your's? Ah, mama, I dare not look at
you, (clapping both her hands before her eyes) I
have been a rebel—I have been a disobedient
wretch, and deserved in my turn to be punished by
ingratitude; yet Falkland ought not to have im∣posed
on me. I should not have blamed him for
loving Cecilia; I know she is handsomer and more
amiable than I am.—Did he make love to you
before he addressed your sister? Oh, yes, yes, and
gave me his promise, and had mine in return; I
have been a sad undutiful creature;—but I am
heavily chastised for it.—And did Falkland assign no
cause for thus cruelly forsaking you? Ah, that is
the hardest thing of all. I thought the shame of it
would have killed me. Indeed it <HI>had</HI> like to have
disturbed my reason.—What was it, my dear?
Why, he said he had always been in love with
Cecilia, and that his pretended love to me was but
the returns of gratitude—He had found then
that <HI>you</HI> loved <HI>him</HI> before he declared himself to
you? The dear creature again covered her innocent
face to hide her blushes. Ah, mama, 'tis a disgrace∣ful
story; do not urge me on that head—yet Falk∣land
should never have known it, if it had not been
for Miss Audley. She told it to her brother, and he
assured <HI>her</HI> that Falkland loved me. So you see each
was informed of the other's mind before we came to
any explanations.</P>
<P>I asked her several more questions, and though she
was not very precise in her answers, I could easily
gather that the two Audleys had been the instruments
to encourage and carry on this fatal connection.
Will you inform me, my dear, said I, (since we
know the most material part of your secret) to what
end you went to that house at Brumpton, since it
was owing to that unfortunate step that you fell
into the hands of Sir Edward Audley? She was silent
for a little while, and seemed as if endeavouring
to recollect something that had slipped her memory.
At length, I do not remember, said she, <HI>all</HI> the
<PB N="128" REF="303"/>
circumstances of that affair; but I think I went to
that house to meet Mr. Falkland.—He writ to me to
come to him there; I have his letter still in my pocket.
She immediately produced a letter in Falkland's
hand to that effect. We all examined it by turns: I
thought Cecilia would have expired at the reading of
it. It was plain this miserable wretch had betrayed
her into the hands of his horrid associate! Good
God, what a scene of iniquity was here disclosed!
The whole mystery was now unravelled. I think,
proceeded my poor child, that I was very ill whilst I
was at Brumpton; but I could get no body to come
near me, though Sir Edward Audley told all my
friends the melancholy condition I was in: False,
false man! You see in every instance how the poor
creature was deceived! Lady Sarah, indeed, added
she, threatened to send my uncle to me; and it was
to avoid his terrible anger that I desired to be sent to
my mama; but they catched me in a trap by the
way.—Mrs. Spillman can tell you how cruelly, I was
treated, 'twas a mercy they did not turn my brain
amongst them. Make yourself easy, my beloved,
said I, you are now out of the reach of all harm.—
Do you call me your <HI>beloved!</HI> said she: Oh, mama,
I do not deserve so much tenderness. She dropped
her head on my shoulder, kissing my neck through
my handkerchief. Mrs. Askham entered the room,
and whispered Mr. Price, who immediately went out.
I asked her softly the occasion of it; she told me that
Mr. Falkland had desired to speak with him alone.</P>
<P>Dolly rose up; she approached her sister, and clasp∣ing
her arms about her neck.—Ah, my poor Cecilia,
said she, I am afraid I have broke her heart! but
pray do not die, my love; <HI>I</HI> am the victim who must
fall; and then you may be happy; a promise does not
reach beyond the grave.—What an ill-fated wretch
I am, to have disturbed the happiness of the two
creatures in the world, whom I love best!—Say
rather, my dear, said Cecilia, that you have been the
instrument of providence to prevent the greatest
misfortune that could have befallen me; for how
<PB N="129" REF="304"/>
miserable should I have been, had I married▪ Falkland!
You <HI>could</HI> not, whilst I lived, said Dolly, without
making him commit a great sin; but when I am gone,
indeed, my sister, you must marry poor Orlando; must
she not, mama?</P>
<P>It was not a subject to be argued upon; I thought
it better to change the discourse: We will talk of this
another time, my dear, said I; mean while I think
it will be best that Falkland should absent himself from
us for a while; I suppose you will neither of
you think it prudent to see him before he goes. I
do not desire to see him, said Dolly; the sight of me
perhaps might make him swoon away again, and I
would not willingly distress him. Nor I, said Cecilia.
She saw I wanted to get rid of the conversation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Askham took the hint, and requesting of Ce∣cilia
to shew her some pretty drawings. of which she
had lately made a purchase; my daughter asked her
to come up to her closet, and they took Dolly with
them. I begged of Mrs. Askham, as she went out,
to stay and pass the day with us, and to prevent as
much as possible, the conversation's turning on the
recent miserable event.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Spillman was almost afraid to see me, lest
I should blame her negligence, which had occasioned
so much disorder; but I told her the hand of Heaven
had directed the whole. She said, that after I had
left her, having huddled on her cloaths with all the
expedition in her power, she had immediately gone
down to Miss Arnold's room, when not finding her
there, she ran, in the utmost fright, down stairs, and
overtook the unhappy child, just as she had reached
the door of the chamber where we were, and from
whence all her efforts could not draw her; she had
even pretty severely hurt Mrs. Spillman's hand, whilst
she was endeavouring to hinder her from turning the
bolt of the lock.</P>
<P>I was impatient to see Mr. Price, to know what
had passed between him and his wretched pupil. He
returned into the parlour to me in about an hour;
<PB N="130" REF="305"/>
his venerable countenance clouded with shame and
disappointment.</P>
<P>He told me that Falkland, on his entering the room,
appeared to him like a despairing wretch, surrounded
with the horrors of his own guilt. Do not think, sir,
said he, that I have sent for you, to enter into a justi∣fication
of myself; so far from it, I acknowledge my∣self
the criminal, which I suppose you now know me
to be. I shall reserve to another time the full expla∣nation
of my whole crime; I would only for the pre∣sent
entreat the favour of you to answer me a few
questions.</P>
<P>He then asked when, and by what means, Miss Ar∣nold
had returned home? Mr. Price informed him
minutely, and failed not to enlarge in a manner the
most affecting on the poor creature's frenzy. He said,
Falkland at this recital started off his chair, and, in
an agony of passion, cursed himself as the author of
such dreadful evils as he had brought upon my house.
His tutor then repeated to him word for word the
conversation I had had with Dolly after we had left
him just recovered from his swoon. He listened to
him in a gloomy silence, till Mr. Price relating to
him that passage wherein Dolly had said, that she was
<HI>assured by Sir Edward Audley, that Falkland loved
her;</HI> he cried out, The villain! the arch-fiend!
it was he then was the builder of this vast fabric of
iniquity, whose weight now crushes all beneath it!
Mr. Price then told him of the letter which Miss Ar∣nold
had shewn us, and by which she was betrayed
into that viper's hands. 'Tis true, said Falkland,
'tis all true; I have not an extenuation to offer which
a hair would not outweigh in the balance. Mr. Price
hinted, that as he thought his presence must be very
distressing in a house wherein he had caused so much
affliction, he would advise him to retire to his college,
till the time of his departure arrived.</P>
<P>I mean, said Falkland, to quit this house imme∣diately;
I would not present such a monster even to
the eyes of the menial servants: but what does Ce∣cilia
<PB N="131" REF="306"/>
say to this event? She bears it, said Mr. Price,
with a firmness that does honour to her sex. That's
some consolation, answered Falkland:—And Mrs.
Arnold? He faltered in pronouncing my name▪ Mrs.
Arnold, answered his preceptor, has been long in∣ured
to sorrows; yet this seems to press hard on
her. Falkland burst into tears, and breaking abrupt∣ly
from Mr. Price, ran out of the room; he heard
him call his man in the hall, to whom he gave orders
to saddle his horses; then stepping to his own cham∣ber,
he changed his cloaths, and in a few minutes af∣ter,
attended by his servant, rode away from the house
without attempting to see or speak to any one in the
family. To what place the most unfortunate ill-fated
wretch will retire to hide his shame, Heaven knows!</P>
<P>What a wedding-day has this been for poor Cecilia!
My dear, the strength of mind of that young creature
amazes me, and exceedingly lowers the opinion I had
of my own constancy and resolution. For was not
this a trial, equal, if not superior to many of those
with which my youth was visited? yet with what a
becoming, what a charming fortitude does she support
it! She complains not of her own fate; but wholly
attaching herself to the care of her poor sister, she
seems even more sollicitous than any of us to calm
and divert her troubled mind.</P>
<P>Dolly appears rather more composed than she has
been; yet whenever she recurs (as she often does in
spight of our efforts to prevent it) to the fatal subject
of all our griefs, she shews too plainly that her rea∣son
is far from having re-assumed its seat. What a
painful constraint have I put upon myself since mor∣ning!
I have not shed a tear; yet I think there is suf∣ficient
cause for tears; but the burden is too great to
be relieved by such slight succours; and nature re∣fuses
to offer a resource so trivial and inadequate to
the evil.</P>

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Bagshot, <DATE>March 24th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Think myself very unfortunate in being obliged to
communicate to you a piece of very afflicting news;
but as it is impossible it could be kept long a secret
from you, I thought it my duty to advise you of it the
first. Your poor brother and my worthy friend, Sir
Edward, was killed this morning in a duel, which
he fought with Mr. Falkland, a gentleman whom I
<PB N="133" REF="308"/>
suppose you know. I was ignorant of the whole af∣fair
till it was too late to prevent it.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland came to my house about eight o'clock
this morning; I was;in bed, and knew not of his ar∣rival.
He had half an hour's conversation in private
with your brother; after which they both went into
the garden together, and from thence by a back door
into a retired part of the heath. Sir Edward's man,
who it seems had some suspicion of the business, on
seeing them go out, ran to my chamber, and alarming
me with the danger, begged I would follow them, as
he said he durst not.</P>
<P>I did so immediately, having only thrown on my
night-gown and slippers. Just as I came within fight
of them, Sir Edward discharged his pistol and wound∣ed
Mr. Falkland in the arm; but before I could reach
them, Falkland fired his, and I saw Sir Edward drop
I ran up to him, and found the ball had passed through
his throat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>close by the windpipe. He was not dead;
but said, Bendish, you have, just overtaken me;
Falkland has killed me fairly, you may tell my friends
so; and let my mother and sister know that I am
married. If any female should come to claim my
name after my death, let her take it; for it is all I have
to leave her. He seemed to speak in great agony,
holding his hand over the wound. He attempted to
say something else; but his words were inarticulate,
and he died in about two hours after he was carried
into the house. I am most heartily sorry for his death,
for he was as honest a fellow as ever lived; but we
must all die.</P>
<P>Falkland is now confined in my house, and under
the care of a surgeon, who says his wound is a very
bad one. I find their quarrel was about a young lady
that poor Audley had ran away with, and who, it
seems, is now out of her senses.</P>
<P>Any commands that you or my lady Audley shall
be pleased to honour me with, in regard to my dear
deceased friend, shall be punctually obeyed by, Madam,</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to the Rev. Mr. PRICE.
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Bagshot, <DATE>March 28th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Suppose you may by this time have heard of the
tragic event, which is likely to detain me for some
time in a kingdom, to which as soon as it is in my
power I shall bid an eternal adieu. But before I
banish myself for ever from your sight, (Oh, that I
could as easily banish the memory of my crimes!)
suffer me, most revered of men, suffer me with that
humility with which such a wretch as I am, should
approach a sanctity like your's, to pour out before
you the effusions of a heart pierced with the deepest
sense of its own guilt.</P>
<P>Do not think that my penitence proceeds from the
languors of a sick bed; the dreaded vengeance of an
injured family; or the keen disappointment of all
my hopes in life. No, my venerable friend, (let me
for this <HI>once</HI> call you so) degraded as I am by vice
and shame, my contrition does not arise from motives
so mean, so base as these. My soul still retains un∣extinguished
a little spark of that virtue which your
pious cares first kindled, and which, had it not been
for my own fatal perverseness, might have lit me to
happiness and honour.</P>
<P>The torture of a painful and dangerous wound has
never been able to force a groan from me; the im∣pending
resentment of those whom I have justly made
my enemies, has not robbed me of a minute's repose;
and the total overthrow of all my worldly expecta∣tions,
passes through my imagination like an empty
vision. But when I think of Mrs. Arnold! of her
children! and of you, my good old man, guide
and instructor of my thankless youth, whose reve∣rend
age blushes to own the degenerate wretch who
so disgracefully has baffled all his flattering hopes, I
<PB N="135" REF="310"/>
wish for death, and in the bitterness of my heart curse
the hour that gave me being!</P>
<P>I would not extenuate by a single grain the weight
of my offence. That suits not with a repentance
so sincere as I hope mine is: yet I cannot help ob∣serving,
that as the unfortunate man, whose life I
have to answer for, was the primary cause of my de∣parture
from right; and led me as it were step by step
to the gulph in which I am now swallowed up, 'twas
just that Heaven should in its instrument of punish∣ment
make use of the hand of him whose mind he
had perverted.</P>
<P>I purpose standing my trial for the death of Sir Ed∣ward
Audley, and afterwards (as I have no apprehen∣sions
on that score) I shall throw myself as a volun∣teer
into the army; for I cannot think of availing my∣self
of my lord V—'s bounty to me, nor could I bear
to look him in the face. I have now not a wish left
but to be forgotten (for I dare not hope to be for∣given)
by those to whom I was once so dear.</P>
<Q>P. S. The unhappy deceased owned in his last mi∣nutes
that he was married. I believe it was to
the young woman who you told me had declared
herself to Mrs. Arnold to be his wife. I had
not supposed her such in his life time; but it
may be some consolation to her to know that he
acknowledged her in the hour of death.</Q>

<OPENER>Miss CECILIA ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 28th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am ordered by my mama to thank you, my dear
madam, for your kind and consoling-letter. She
would have answered it herself but for an indispo∣sition,
which, though but a slight one, makes writing
a painful task to her. She would not, however, as
you had desired to hear from us, delay acknow∣ledging
your favour.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="311"/>
These are my mama's own words, which she
charged me to make use of; but oh, my dear Mrs.
B—, we are all dying with apprehensions! her dis∣order,
I am afraid, is worse, much worse than she
will own it to be. There has been a visible change
in her from day to day, since that dreadful one of
which she gave you an account in her last letter.
She has entirely lost her rest and her appetite. A
slow fever seems to consume her, attended with a
constant thirst; yet she retains not a minute in her
stomach the lightest liquids which she takes. She
endeavours as much as possible to hide from us
every sympton of her illness. Doctor Key attends
her, and flatters us with the hope of her soon getting
the better of it; yet I cannot rid myself of my fears.
God preserve her dear and most precious life! If she
should be taken from us, think, ah think, my good
Mrs. B—, what would be the condition, of two poor
desolate creatures like my sister and me! The cause
too! so mournful! 'tis, not to be thought of without
almost dying of grief.</P>
<P>We have had a letter from my uncle Bidulph, in
which he writes word that it was reported, Sir Ed∣ward
Audley had been killed in a duel, and his an∣tagonist
wounded. I suppose you have heard the
account, and therefore I need not name to you his
antagonist. Sir George says he knows not particu∣lars,
nor is certain even of the fact; but I believe
he threw this in only to soften the shock which he
knew this account must give us; and he adds, <HI>if the
news be true, 'twere pity the two associate fiends</HI>
(these were his terrible words) <HI>did not perish by each
other's hand!</HI></P>
<P>My poor mama was exceedingly shocked at this
account, for it appears but too probable. Mrs. Spill∣marn
cried the whole day, though I think Sir Edward
Audley ill deserves to be regretted by her.</P>
<P>We mentioned not the story to my sister; we are
afraid of aggravating her malady, by any thing that
would alarm her tender spirits. She appears pretty
tranquil, yet we are in hourly fears of a relapse, for
<PB N="137" REF="312"/>
it is easy to perceive her poor head is not yet as it
should be. We see no company, and therefore have
not had this frightful news confirmed; but Mrs. Ask∣ham
says she has heard of it from several people.</P>
<P>I divide my cares between my mama and my sister.
My own particular griefs are absorbed in theirs; yet
indeed, my dear madam, your little friend Cecilia
has met with a heavy blow, and she feels it too at
the very bottom of her heart.</P>
<P>We all join in most sincere respects to Mr. B—.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, madam, &amp;c.
P. S. My mama received a letter yesterday from my
lord V—. I know not the contents; but she
says it is full of tenderness and friendship for
her and her family. I doubt it not; he is a most
excellent man.</CLOSER>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>April 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the twenty-eighth past con∣firmed
the account which before had reached us
of your tragic adventure. The unfortunate deceased,
I fear, but too well merited his fate; yet I tremble
to think that you have by this daring action so swel∣led
the grievous account of your offences. I pray
God continue to you that lively compunction with
which, from a just sense of your errors, you seem at
present to be filled. Great indeed has been your fall∣ing
off from virtue! and terrible have been the con∣sequences!
yet the path is not irrecoverable: let that
thought sustain your hope: but take care that it does
not extinguish your repentance. You shall not want
my exhortations and advice; I wish I could add a
word of comfort; but I am afraid there is a woeful
<PB N="138" REF="313"/>
event approaching, which will greatly aggravate
your's, and mine, and all our sufferings.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold is dangerously ill; her fortitude is at
length vanquished; and she is now meekly sinking
under that stroke, which as from a two-edged sword
has at one blow cleft in twain so many hearts!</P>
<P>She is desirous of seeing you, that she may with
her own lips acquit herself of that great duty of our
religion, namely, to forgive those who have sinned
against us. If you are in any wise in a condition to
be removed, I beg you will cause yourself forthwith
to be conveyed to Woodberry. Sorry am I to say,
that this probably may be one of the last acts of
piety, which my excellent friend and patroness may
have it in her power to perform. Do not therefore
let ill-timed and false shame, deprive you of so great
a benefit.</P>
<P>I am, with ardent prayers for your amendment in
this life, and salvation in the next,</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ASKHAM to Mrs. CECILIA B—
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>April 7th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am desired by the mournful family to acquaint
you with a piece of news the most afflicting that
ever you received. I hope you have been prepared
for it, and that the black seal on this letter will make
you guess at its sorrowful contents.</P>
<P>Oh, madam,—my mistress! my benefactress!
my friend! for such she <HI>was!</HI>—but <HI>she</HI> is happy,
and it is the poor survivors who are to be pitied.</P>
<P>Miss Cecilia writ you word how fast her mama's
health was declining. We all saw it, yet the admira∣ble
lady herself struggled against her disorder as long
as she was able; but last Tuesday, finding herself much
<PB N="139" REF="314"/>
worse than ordinary, she was obliged to be put again
to bed after she had risen and dressed herself.</P>
<P>I was with her, as I constantly passed every day▪ at
the house since Miss Arnold's return. Mrs. Askham,
said she, smiling, and taking me by the hand, as I
sat at her bed-side, I'll tell you a secret; then lower∣ing
her voice (for her waiting-maid was in the room)
I am going very fast, said she; this last, blow has
struck home and effectually done its work. I was
obliged to whip out my handkerchief, and could
only answer, God forbid, madam! Do you then
begrudge me my repose, my dear Party? said she;
I thought you would have congratulated me.—
Do not say any thing to the poor children, added
she; they will have time enough to lament me when
all is over. There are two points which I would
wish to accomplish before I die. One of them I
shall not mention to you at present; the other is to
see and be reconciled to Falkland; for indeed, Patty,
Falkland is as much the author of my death, as if he
had dispatched me with a pistol ball, as he has done
Sir Edward Audley. Poor forlorn wretch! I <HI>know</HI>
he will accuse himself of it when I shall not have it
in my power to grant him pardon; 'tis, for this rea∣son
I would willingly accord it to him now, as the
last gift I have to bequeath him, for I have already
taken care of his fortune. You have seen, continued
she, the letter he has written to Mr. Price. I <HI>think</HI>
his repentance is sincere; and in that belief, I would
not wish to leave the world without affording him the
single consolation he can now receive, that of know∣ing
from my own mouth that I forgive him.</P>
<P>She then desired me to call Mr. Price to her, which
I did; and after having given him her reason for de∣siring
it, she begged he would write a few lines to
Mr. Falkland requesting his presence at Woodberry
as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The poor lady complained of a pain in her chest,
and a dizziness in her head. I entreated her to suffer
another physician to be called in to the assistance of
Doctor Key. My good friend, said she, if I thought
<PB N="140" REF="315"/>
I could be relieved by human means, I should think
myself bound to follow your advice; but, indeed,
my dear, my case is out of the reach of medicine, and
though I permit a physician to attend me for form
sake, I <HI>feel</HI> that it is all over with me. Believe me,
Patty, 'tis what I have longed for; and if I had not
thought it a crime, 'tis that for which I should most
earnestly have prayed,</P>
<P>She desired that Miss Arnold might be let to stay
with her as little as possible, lest it should affect her
spirits too much; but Miss Cecilia was almost con∣stantly
at her bed-side. The sweet young lady, what
a dismal time she has had for this fortnight past! but
she takes after her excellent mother in courage, as
well as in every other persection. Mr. Price, Mrs.
Spillman, and myself did all we could to entertain
Miss Arnold, and divert her from going into her
mama's room. We had a hard task to prevent, her,
she <HI>would</HI> attend her mama, was she not as capable
as Cecilia? True, my dear miss, but the doctor has
ordered your mama to be kept extremely quiet; she
is forbid to speak, and one person is sufficient to be
with her at a time. And why cannot <HI>I</HI> be that one
person? for I would sit by her all day without open∣ing
my lips. Ah, Mrs. Askham, I see I am not tho∣roughly
forgiven—We were obliged now and then
to let her go into her chamber. She would enter
softly, peep in at the bed's feet, and after looking
for about a minute sorrowfully at her mama, retire
again without speaking.</P>
<P>The day passed over in this manner. Mrs. Arnold
could not be prevailed on to touch any thing but
a little weak chicken broth; she said she had a loath∣ing
at the thoughts of eating; indeed, her stomach
had not been able to bear any thing solid for several
days before; I would fain have passed the night by
her, but she would not suffer me: You need, not fear
my <HI>escaping</HI> to-night, said she; I shall not accomplish
my journey so soon.</P>
<P>When I attended her next morning, I found her,
as I thought, much better. She told me the pain
<PB N="141" REF="316"/>
in her chest was entirely gone, the giddiness, which
she had complained of the day before, was greatly
diminished, and that she felt nothing but an universal
feebleness, which, without being painful, had re∣duced
her to a state weaker than that of new-born
infancy.</P>
<P>Never was any thing so calm, so tranquil as she
continued the whole day. Mr. Price came in to sit
with her. I have been thinking this morning, said
she, of a circumstance, about which (though I look
upon it as too trivial to mention in my will) I should
nevertheless chuse to leave a memorandum. What
is it, my good madam? said Mr. Price. It was al∣ways
my wish, replied she, to live with as much pri∣vacy
as possible, and to go out of the world with as
little pomp as I came into it; and for this reason, it
has ever been my intention to be laid, without any
noise, and as little ceremony as may be, in the church
of whatever parish I should happen to die in. I
therefore just mention this to you, Mr. Price, as I
think you the properest person to receive such an in∣junction.
I hope, said the good gentleman, the ful∣filling
this injunction is a duty which will never be
paid by me. My dear sir, replied Mrs. Arnold, do
you say that by way of encouraging me with the
hopes of <HI>life?</HI> Ah, I thought you knew me better;
and that I had at least the credit with you of not
being supposed afraid to die. That I am sure you
are not, madam; you are a good woman; your life
has been uniformly pious; and I think, as far as
humanity will admit of the eulogium, you are <HI>blame∣less.</HI>
I would not be guilty of arrogance, answer∣ed
Mrs. Arnold; yet I have the inexpressible satis∣faction
to declare, that, upon taking a survey of my
past life, I do not recollect ever to have been <HI>wil∣fully</HI>
guilty of an action contrary to the duty I owe
my Maker. Mr. Price lifted up his hands and eyes,
as if in thankfulness to Heaven. I know, pursued
Mrs. Arnold, it is more customary, and perhaps
more becoming too, even for good people, when
they find their end is drawing near, to accuse them∣selves
<PB N="142" REF="317"/>
as very sinful persons: but how easy is it to
put on the robe of humiliation, and to assume the
look and tone of penitence! whilst, perhaps, their
heart does not, <HI>can</HI> not feel compunction for tres∣passes,
which in their health and strength they thought
too trivial for atonement, and which now, without
making any real impression on them, they acknow∣ledge
more from supposition than recollection. Let
those whose consciences are really oppressed, seek
for consolation in an humble confession of their faults:
but if the soul, retiring to search into herself, finds
in those solemn hours, when nothing within can di∣vert
her from the awful scrutiny, nor from without
can seduce her to pervert the truth, if then she finds
that she is self-acquitted, let her boldly stand up, and,
like righteous Samuel, declare her own innocence;
not presumptuously to vaunt a superior virtue, but
to give our repining friends, who perhaps may too
tenderly lament us, the greatest and best founded
consolation they can receive: and this, my good
sir, is my only reason for telling you I am not afraid
to die. I know it, madam, answered Mr. Price;
and am as well convinced of your reasons as I am
of the fact itself: yet you are still in the prime of life,
and it is natural for your friends to wish that you
should—What, my dear sir? drag on a few more
miserable years? and have, in all likelihood, the in∣firmities
of age superadded to my misfortunes! No,
no, my worthy friend, they love me not wisely who
would wish to see my days prolonged. This is a fit
season for my departure, when I look upon the sum∣mons
to <HI>quit</HI> life as a greater blessing than any which
could now be bestowed upon me in it. You know
I have suffered a variety of sorrows; and though I
may have (when my impatience got the better of my
submission) in some unguarded minute wished for a
release, yet still, in my calmer hours, I found some
call that drew me back to life; some tie, that I could
not see without regret about to be dissolved; and I
found, upon reflection, that I should have died but
half resigned. But my fate <HI>now</HI> seems to be consum∣mated.
<PB N="143" REF="318"/>
Disappointed in my <HI>last</HI> hopes, what is there
to attach me to this world? Let me quit it then,
whilst my longings after another are alive and warm;
whilst the recent smart of my sufferings makes me
consider my dismission as the tenderest mercy that
my creator (without reversing his own decrees) could
vouchsafe me. This is the use, my good Mr. Price,
that I would fain make of my afflictions; 'tis the use
I would have my friends make of them; and instead
of murmuring that my years were so soon cut off, to
return thanks to God that he did not lengthen them.</P>
<P>I have been enabled, madam, to give you the con∣versation
of this blessed lady by Mr. Price's means,
who having, after he had left her chamber, writ down
every word she had said to him, suffered me to take a
copy of it.</P>
<P>She continued the remainder of that and all the
next day without any visible alteration. We would
fain have flattered ourselves with hope; but we dared
not even to hint it to Mrs. Arnold: <HI>Her</HI> hope and
ours, Mr. Price said, had different centers.</P>
<P>She retained her usual sweet composure; and with∣out
affecting to be chearful, shewed not the least ap∣pearance
of gloominess or impatience. What a hap∣piness
is it, said she, thus to glide so smoothly from
one shore to another! I feel neither pain nor sickness;
and if it were not for certain sensations I have within,
and which I cannot describe, joined to a feebleness
which increases hourly, I should almost doubt whe∣ther
my deliverance were so near at hand: yet I am
sure my task will be accomplished in a day or two.
Whenever the event happens, I would have Mrs. B—
apprized of it tenderly. I have already desired Cecilia
to prepare her for it by a second letter; for when
she writ the first I knew not how long the combat
might have lasted.</P>
<P>She mentioned Mr. Falkland several times; expres∣sing
some uneasiness lest he should not come, or,
what would be worse, should not arrive time enough.
For it is for his own sake chiefly, said she, I wish to
see him.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="319"/>
Mr. Falkland, however, did arrive on Friday night.
He was obliged to be brought in a litter: he had had
a violent fever. His wound, it seems, was so dange∣rous
a one, that the surgeons were for some time in
doubt whether they must not have been forced to
take off his arm. He was reduced extremely low,
and could not bear the motion of any other convey∣ance
than that by which he was carried.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold was told he was come. I am glad of
it, said she; for I think to-morrow it would have
been too late. The two Miss Arnolds happened both
to be in the room, when notice was given that Mr.
Falkland was below stairs. Their mama had before
told them that she expected him; and now asked
them, if they chose to see him, or would rather re∣tire?
They begged their mama's permission to stay.
She requested Mr. Price to go and conduct Mr. Falk∣land
up stairs, in order, I suppose, to give him an
opportunity of preparing the unfortunate young man
for such an interview; for probably he did not ex∣pect
to see either of the young ladies.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold withdrew into a corner of the room,
which being darkened by a screen, it was not easy
to distinguish her. She sat down, covering her face
with her white handkerchief. Miss Cecilia kept her
place by her mama's bed-side; but I could perceive
her colour came and went.—We all waited in silent
expectation. I thought the time appeared long be∣fore
Mr. Falkland came up stairs; yet I dreaded to
see him: and when I heard the chamber door open,
I felt as if my flesh as it were crept. Mr. Price en∣tered
first, Mr. Falkland followed him with a slow
pace; his left arm was slung in a black scarf, and he
looked like one risen from his grave. Miss Cecilia
rose up, making him a kind of salute, but did not
speak. She was the first object that struck his eyes
on entering the room; but he turned them quickly
from her, as if the sight of her were insupportable to
him. Oh, madam, had you seen him, you would, in
spight of his faults, have pitied the unhappy youth!
His countenance so abashed! so mortified! so afflicted!
<PB N="145" REF="320"/>
He approached Mrs. Arnold's bed-side with trembling
steps, where, throwing himself on his knees, he hid
his face on the coverlet, and burst into tears. The
poor lady herself seemed extremely moved. She laid
one of her hands on his head, and was for some time
without being able to utter a word. Miss Cecilia
could not constrain herself any longer, she wept bit∣terly;
and poor Miss Arnold, who from her corner
had observed what was passing, sobbed so loud, that
I was afraid she would have been suffocated, and ran
to her assistance. She put me from her gently; then
rising up, she stepped softly behind the curtain of her
mama's bed, and bending down, with her arms half
stretched out, hung over Mr. Falkland, as if she were
inclined, but afraid to raise him up. His tears were
still gushing abundantly Mrs. Arnold at length
broke her affecting silence; but the tone of her voice
had something still more touching in it. It was in∣terrupted
and unequal; it was the voice of tender∣ness
mixed with grief. I did not send for you, Or∣lando,
to distress you thus—I believe you are sorry
for the misfortunes that you have brought upon my
family—I forgive you from my soul—This is not a
time for reproaches; I would willingly comfort you,
if I could.—Which <HI>way,</HI> madam? said Falkland,
lifting up his head; do you think with such objects
as <HI>these</HI> before my eyes (looking round him) that I
can be comforted? Oh! no, no, though I have lost
my virtue, I have not lost my feelings.—You must
deprive me of memory, of reason, of humanity, be∣fore
you talk of comfort! It becomes you, said Mrs.
Arnold, to have a just sorrow for your misconduct;
but do not let a too lively sense of it transport you
into wild excesses. I would fain attribute your fault
to youth, to passion; but above all, to wicked coun∣sel
and example. Do not, therefore, look upon your∣self
as abandoned to evil; but endeavour rather, in
your future conduct, to make what atonement you
can for the past. I speak this only with regard to
what concerns your own welfare; for as to me and
these two children, you have no reparation in your
<PB N="146" REF="321"/>
power—The evil is past remedy; and the only con∣solation
that I have to offer you, is to tell you that
you are <HI>forgiven.</HI> It was for this purpose only that
I desired to see you, as I thought it might a little
lighten the burden of a wounded conscience. I do
therefore again repeat it to you, that I quit life with
the same sentiments of compassion and maternal love
for you that I felt when your helpless infancy was
by your dear father first committed to my charge.—
I think, added she, after pausing, as if to recover from
the emotion which this last recollection had occa∣sioned,
I think I can venture to promise that my two
daughters grant you as free a pardon as I do. What
say you, my children?</P>
<P>Miss Cecilia was the first to reply; and stepping up
to the bed-side, <HI>I,</HI> madam, am least injured of all,
said she; yet were his offences against me even greater
than they are, <HI>your</HI> example would teach me to blot
them all from my mind; therefore, from hencefor∣ward,
Falkland, you may again look upon me as your
sister; but for any other tie, though you were to∣morrow
at liberty, and all my friends consenting to the
union, I should for ever renounce it. Nor should I
dare to think of it, replied Mr. Falkland. And you,
my dear, said the excellent woman to Miss Arnold,
do not you forgive this poor youth? Ah, mama, I
have no resentment against him—I never had—'Tis
<HI>I</HI> who should demand forgiveness of him; if it had
not been for me he might have been happy, so might
poor Cecilia, so might you: but I have broke all your
hearts! Yet indeed, Orlando, I did not mean to di∣vide
you from your love—I had made a resolution to
die in silence—I know not what tempted me to break
it, unless it be (which I suspect to be the truth) that I
was that day seized with a strange distraction. For∣give
me, sir, pray forgive me! And she held up both
her hands, fixing her sweet eyes with a supplicating
look on Mr. Falkland's face. Oh, God! cried he,
wringing his hands, 'tis just that my punishment should
be proportioned to my crimes! yet I cannot bear
this! He turned from her in an agony of grief. She
<PB N="147" REF="322"/>
followed him—He will not speak to me, mama! I
do not wonder he should be angry, yet I wish he
would not hate me! Speak to her, said Mrs. Arnold,
her voice broken with sobs—Indulge her; you see
how it is with her. Mr. Falkland threw himself at
her feet; No, dearest Miss Arnold, said he, Falkland
is not altogether such a monstrous prodigy as to hate
you! He esteems, he respects, he reveres you more
than ever; and if he shuns your sight, 'tis shame, and
not resentment, that bids him hide his face. Miss
Arnold just lightly pressed with her fingers one of his
hands. I am satisfied then, said she; and, with a
pleased look, quitted him, and retired again behind
the curtain.</P>
<P>We were all deeply moved at this scene. You
may judge, madam, how the poor dying lady was
affected. I drew near to the bed-side. Her spirits
seemed quite exhausted, and her face was in a cold
sweat. I begged of her to take something to refresh
her; and she suffered me to give her a little wine and
water with a few drops in it.</P>
<P>I have now, said she, accomplished one half of my
work; if I can complete the other, I shall die in
peace. Cecilia, my dear, come hither. The young
lady approached her; and Mrs. Arnold drew from
under her pillow a letter. I received this some time
ago, said she, from my lord V—. Let Mr. Price
read it aloud, that you may all hear the contents of
it. Mr. Price did so; and here inclosed, madam, I
send you a copy of it.</P>
<P>I did not chuse, said Mrs. Arnold to Miss Cecilia,
to communicate this letter to you, till I knew how
your heart stood affected to Falkland. I therefore
only told my lord V—, in answer to what he had
written, that I should take a time to recal the subject
to you. This is the time, Cecilia, that I have chosen.
I have just now heard you declare that you renounced
all union with Falkland. He is here present; here
is your sister; and here our two worthy friends.
Will you, my dear Cecilia, will you give your dying
mother the consolation to think that she leaves her
<PB N="148" REF="323"/>
child under the protection of that worthy lord? If
your heart is still repugnant to him, I do not mean
by a <HI>last</HI> request to constrain it; but if you think
you can be happy with lord V—, say you will
be his wife. Miss Cecilia kneeled down, and taking
one of her mama's hands, which she tenderly kissed,
wetting it with her tears, Yes, my beloved mama,
I make you the promise you require, in presence of
all these witnesses. I respect my lord V—, I honour
him above all men; and if he is still willing to offer
me his hand, I will receive it with gratitude. I
thank you, my love, said Mrs. Arnold; my work is
now finished.</P>
<P>She then desired her will might be brought to her,
saying she had a few words to add. She directed me
to a drawer in a little cabinet by her bed-side, where
I found it folded up. I gave it to her, together with
a pen and ink; and having raised her up in bed with
her pillows at her back, she wrote a few lines. Then
folding up the paper again, she put it into Mr. Price's
hands, with these words, let my brother Bidulph
know that this was the last action of my life; and tell
him—She stopped short, as if interrupted by some
sudden and extraordinary emotion; a fine colour
flushed at once into her face, and her eyes, which
were before funk and languishing, seemed in an
instant to have recovered all their fire. I never saw
so animated a figure! She sprung forward with energy,
her arms extended, her eyes lifted up with rapture,
and, with an elevated voice, she cried out—<HI>I come!</HI>
Then sinking down softly on her pillow she closed
her eyes, and expired without a sigh.—Oh, madam,
this was not the exit of a dying woman, it was the
ascension of a blessed spirit to heaven! We were all
surrounding her bed, our looks turned as it were me∣chanically
towards the place where hers had been
fixed; when turning them again towards her, The
saint is at length fallen asleep, said Mr. Price; and
quits life with the same dignity which accompanied
her throughout all her actions!</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="324"/>
I thought not at first that she was dead. Poor
Miss Arnold was in the same error; and seeing her
mama lie so still, What a sweet slumber this is, said
she, and how suddenly it has fallen upon her! My
poor mama! we have fatigued her with our discourse;
but I hope this sleep will do her good. We must
not disturb her. Come, Cecilia, let us leave her to
her repose; Mrs. Asksnam will be so kind as to stay
by her.</P>
<P>Miss Cecilia answered her not; but throwing one
arm round her sister's waist, while with the other she
covered her eyes with her handkerchief, she let her∣self
be led out of the room; Miss Arnold, with a
smiling countenance looking back at her mama.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland stood motionless at the bed's feet,
his eyes fixed in mute sorrow on the lifeless corse of
her, who had been more than a mother to him; of
her whose days <HI>he</HI> had shortened, by a conduct of
which he now felt all the shame and all the guilt.
The suddenness of her departure (for a few minutes
before we saw no symptoms of approaching death)
had amazed and terrified him. He beheld her some
time in silence; then bursting into a passion of grief,
little short of frenzy, he smote his breast, and tearing
his fine curled hair out by the roots, And is this,
said he, the comfort I was bid to hope in coming
hither! to be a witness to the ruin and desolation
that I myself have made! Look at thy handy-work,
Falkland; behold the fruit of thy horrid perfidy!
Was it not enough to drive your child to madness, to
see that accomplished mind quite overturn'd and lost?
Must I have the aggravated crime to answer for of
making her an orphan too! Then throwing himself
down by the body of Mrs. Arnold, 'Tis mine, said
he, my accursed head that should have been laid
low, and not this of the most respectable of women!</P>
<P>Mr. Price took him by the hand, and intreating
him to rise, Have more respect, said he, for these
pious remains, and do not prophane them by use∣less
and outrageous expressions of passion. Let me
beseech you, sir, to withdraw with me. This cham∣ber
<PB N="150" REF="325"/>
must be left unmolested to Mrs. Askham and the
women servants; we must now take our leave of it.
Then by a motion, which appeared almost involuntary,
he bowed to the honoured corse; and laying hold on
Mr. Falkland's arm, drew him, not without difficulty,
out of the chamber.</P>
<P>Thus, madam, have I given you an account of
the last hours of Mrs. Arnold. I believe you know
she was scarce eight and thirty; and she still retained
a large portion of that exquisite beauty, which had
been so much admired in her youth. We did not let
Miss Arnold know of her death till this morning. It
has quite overwhelmed her. Words cannot express
the sorrow that is spread throughout the whole house.
I shall do myself the honour to write to you again in
a few days, as it cannot be expected that poor Miss
Cecilia will be in a condition to do it. Mr. Price
writes this day to inform Sir George Bidulph of our
great loss; and I take the opportunity of sending
this by the servant who carries his letter. May
God preserve you, madam, to Mr. B—and your
dear family. I am, with the utmost respect,</P>

<P>I Have, with unspeakable concern, received from
Sir George Bidulph an account of the fatal event
which has lately happened in your family; and take
the privilege of a man honoured with your friendship,
of mingling my sincere sorrow with yours on so affect∣ing

suggestion my heart might whisper to me at
another time, pity at this juncture, forbids me to

Falkland as a rival, or condemning him as a man, I
cannot withhold from him that compassion to which
his sufferings intitle him.</P>
<P>You are sensible, madam, that I did my utmost to
promote a union, on which I thought the happiness

to her heart; that was denied me; yet she favoured
me with her friendship, her esteem, her confidence.
I shall endeavour to retain those as the corner-stones
on which to build my future hopes.—I dare not at

only beg of you, that if I can, in any respect what∣soever,

<OPENER>Mrs. ASKHAM to Mrs. CECILIA B—.
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>April 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall begin with telling you that the two young
ladies are at present in as tolerable health as can
be expected, considering the cruel blow they have
just received. They neither of them, however, stir
out of their chamber; nor have they seen Mr.
Falkland since the night of their mama's death,
though he is still in the house; for he was seized
the next day with a return of his fever, and has been
confined to his bed ever since; though I hope he is
not in any danger.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph arrived here the day after he
received Mr. Price's letter. He was deeply affected
at entering the house; and when he saw the two
<PB N="152" REF="327"/>
young ladies, he wept bitterly, and with great kind∣ness
endeavoured to console them.</P>
<P>He desired to have a sight of his sister; and I
conducted him into her chamber, where Mrs. Spill∣man,
the house-keeper, and her own maid were
sitting. He fixed his eyes on her, for some time,
with great tenderness. Look, Mrs. Askham, said
he, at that poor little pale piece of clay! We both
remember her once the boast and ornament of her
sex. She sacrificed the happiness of her whole life
to a too rigid duty, and at length her life itself is
sacrificed to ingratitude! Oh, Sidney, thou must be
greatly recompensed, or—He stopped at this
word; and desiring I would preserve for him a lock
of her hair, he retired, the tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>Mr. Price said he had not yet opened Mrs. Arnold's
will: as she had named Sir George Bidulph one of
her executors, he told him he had waited for his
arrival. Sir George requested it might be read. I
was present with the two young ladies. She has
bequeathed her real estate, which is considerable,
equally between them, and has left to Mr. Falkland
a legacy of ten thousand pounds. She has left to
every one of her friends a token of remembrance;
and has not forgot any one of her servants, even
down to the lowest of them. In a little codicil,
dated four days before her death, she bequeaths Mrs.
Spillman three thousand pounds, charged on her
daughters estate, as she had already disposed of all
her personal fortune in a variety of legacies. This,
she says, she leaves her as a token of her gratitude
for the eminent service she rendered Miss Arnold.</P>
<P>Mr. Price having read through the whole will,
which was duly executed, came to those lines which
the admirable lady had written a few minutes before
her death. Here is something added, said he to Sir
George, which Mrs. Arnold desired me to tell you
was the last act of her life; and so indeed it was.
These, madam, were her words.</P>
<P>“My daughter Celicia has given me her promise
to become the wife of lord V—. 'Tis therefore
<PB N="153" REF="328"/>
my desire, that she give her hand to that worthy
nobleman, as soon after my decease as decency will
permit; and that she take her sister Arnold home
to her own house, there to remain under her tender
care, till it shall please Almighty God to restore her
(of which I am not without hope) to the perfect
use of her reason, and thereby enable her to
conduct herself.”</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph listened with pleasure to this
article, looking affectionately at Miss Cecilia, who,
together with her sister, was drowned in tears from
the moment Mr. Price had begun to read. You
have then consented, niece, said he, to marry my
lord V—? I have, sir, replied the young lady.
That's well! answered Sir George; <HI>one</HI> of you, at
least will be happy. He spoke not to Miss Arnold,
but turned the conversation to some other subject.
Mr. Price told me afterwards, that upon Sir George's
being informed that Mr. Falkland was in the house,
and very ill, he replied, “What a mercy it would
be to us all if he were to die! I cannot bear the
thoughts of him, and hope we may never meet.”</P>
<P>When Mr. Price acquainted Mr. Falkland with
what Mrs. Arnold had done for him in her will, it
drew from him the most passionate exclamations of
his own unworthiness, mixed with the tenderest
acknowledgments of gratitude for her memory. He
purposes retiring from hence as soon as he is able to
go abroad, and to remain concealed at some friend's
house, till he is ready to depart from England.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Arnold had desired to be buried privately
in her parish church, she is to be interred to-night
agreeably to her request. Sir George Bidulph intends
returning to town to-morrow. The two young
ladies continue here, neither of them choosing to
accompany him to London; neither indeed does Sir
George desire it, as it is expected the marriage of
Miss Cecilia with my lord V—will very soon take
place.</P>
<P>Thus you see, madam, things are in a more fa∣vourable
<PB N="154" REF="329"/>
train than could be reasonably hoped after
so many disastrous events. I am, madam, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS is the last letter which appears in this col∣lection.
The remainder of Mrs. Arnold's history, or
rather that of her daughters, is drawn up by Mrs.
Askham herself; but as her style is somewhat diffuse,
and the narrative contains many minute and some
immaterial circumstances, I shall endeavour to com∣press
it in as narrow a compass as I can; giving the
readers only such events as they may naturally be
supposed curious to know. I have taken the like
liberty with some of Mrs. Askham's letters, for which
I hope her daughter will pardon me; as, without
altering the sense, I have only here and there changed
the phrase.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CONCLUSION of Mrs. ARNOLD's HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Falkland withdrew from Woodberry a few
days after the interment of Mrs. Arnold, and
retired to the house of a gentleman a few miles from
Oxford. The two Miss Arnolds requested of Mrs.
Askham not to leave them in their present melancho∣ly
situation; and they invited Mrs. Spillman to stay
with them till her affairs were settled. Nothing
could be more amiable than the behaviour of Miss
Cecilia to her sister; her whole time was employed
in soothing and consoling her. She mentioned not
Mr. Falkland's name; or, if she did, it was but to
return thanks to Heaven who had preserved her
from the misfortune of being his wife. She spoke of
lord V—with the highest veneration, and of her
intended marriage with him as of an event which
would make her happy. This was the only topic
from whence poor miss Arnold seemed to draw any
consolation, for her tears perpetually flowed for the
loss of her excellent mother.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="330"/>
Lord V—writ a letter of condolance to miss
Cecilia immediately after Sir George Bidulph's return
to town. He touched with great delicacy, yet with
the warmest acknowledgments, on the concession she
had made in his favour, and hinted his intention of
attending her at Woodberry as soon as her grief
would permit her to receive his visit.</P>
<P>Things were in this situation, when the two young
ladies were surprized one day by a very unexpected
guest. It was miss Audley, who, having come
down to Oxford on some family affairs which her
brother's death made it necessary to settle, took this
opportunity of paying them a visit. She was in deep
mourning, and her looks well corresponded with her
habit. The two miss Arnolds melted at the sight of
a companion whom they had known in their happier
days. Miss Audley mixed her tears with theirs, not
from sympathy, for her heart was pierced with real
grief for the loss of a brother whom (however un∣worthy)
she had passionately loved. The sight of her
two young friends revived her afflicting remembrance
of him. The melancholy appearance of a house
wherein she had passed so many chearful hours, just
deprived of its admirable mistress; the recollection
of poor miss Arnold's frenzy; of Falkland's despair
(of which Mr. Bendish had given her an account);
all these mournful ideas presenting themselves to her
mind at once, joined to the inward consciousness of
having herself but too fatally contributed to so many
dreadful mischiefs, stung her with remorse, and pro∣bably
for the first time in her life, made her reflect
seriously on her own faulty conduct.</P>
<P>Miss Audley's education had been ill calculated to
inspire her with the principles of virtue. Her early
childhood had, in that respect, been totally neglect∣ed;
having been, by the indolence of a mother,
too sond of pleasure, turned over to the care of an
ignorant governess of a boarding-school. Her more
advanced years, under the conduct of that same
mother, had been spent in idleness and dissipation:
always used to expence, and brought up with the
<PB N="156" REF="331"/>
expectations of a fortune, she found herself now by
Sir Edward's death, whose affairs were irretrievably
involved, cut off from all her flattering prospects,
and reduced to a mortifying dependence on her
mother's small jointure. She was not able to sustain
this change; and in proportion as she had been
intoxicated by vanity, was she now abased by
despondence.</P>
<P>She told the two miss Arnolds, that she was come
to take her leave of them; that her mama and she not
being able to endure the living in England after the
tragic event which had so lately happened in their
family, were determined to withdraw into France,
in order to pass there the remainder of their days.
She expressed herself deeply affected at the miseries
which had been brought upon Mrs. Arnold's house
by her brother's means; acknowledged that <HI>he</HI> had
been even more to blame than Falkland, and in the
hurry of her spirits between confusion and remorse,
accused herself bitterly for the part she had acted.</P>
<P>Mrs. Askham, who was present at this conversa∣tion,
seeing the young lady's heart so open, and (as
she hoped) so penitent for her fault, took this op∣portunity
of telling her, that since she had the happi∣ness
to be sensible of her errors, was so good as to be
sorry for them, and so generous as to acknowledge
them, that she hoped she would still go farther; and
as the only compensation she could make was to ren∣der
all the justice in her power to Mr. Falkland, it
would be very acceptable to the family to know by
what means he and miss Arnold had been led into
engagements so contrary to their duty; so contrary to
miss Arnold's reserved and timid disposition; and so
contrary even to Mr. Falkland's own inclinations.
She added, that they had got but very imperfect
lights from miss Arnold, and as it was a subject they
never wished to renew to her, and which indeed she
might not be so well qualified to clear up as miss
Audley herself, they should think themselves obliged
to that lady if she would gratify them with the
explanation they desired. Miss Audley replied, it will
<PB N="157" REF="332"/>
be a very shameful confession for me, Mrs. Askham,
and probably were I to continue here I should not
have the courage to make it; but since I am going to
leave England, <HI>never,</HI> I believe, to return to it, I
will, before my departure, give up some letters,
which, in a light however reproachful they may put
me and my brother, will at least in some measure
justify Falkland: and this is a duty which I think
myself <HI>bound</HI> to fulfil.</P>
<P>Miss Cecilia begged Miss Audley's permission to
introduce Mrs. Spillman to her, as the acknowledged
wife of Sir Edward.</P>
<P>Miss Audley received her with great civility, and
embraced her. She told her politely, how great∣ly
she was afflicted that so unfortunate an events
had brought her to the knowledge of a person,
whom in her brother's life-time she should have estee∣med
herself happy to have called sister. She expres∣sed
her sorrow that her brother had nothing to leave
her but his name; and said that she and her mama
should be extremely pleased to see her in London for
the little time they had to stay there. Mrs Spillman
received her caresses with great modesty; she had put
on deep mourning; but not weeds. She said, with
regard to the first article, it affected her but very
little, as by Mrs. Arnold's goodness she was amply
provided for; and as for the second, You see, ma∣dam,
said she, pointing to her dress, that I meant
not to assume a title after Sir Edward's decease, of
which he did not think me worthy during his life.</P>
<P>Miss Audley took her leave of the two ladies with
the warmest demonstrations of regard, begging of
them to attribute her imprudent conduct to no worse
a motive than the true one, her strong affection to a
brother, whom she had suffered to influence her too
far.</P>
<P>My lord V—and Sir George Bidulph came toge∣ther
to Woodberry a few days after this. Miss Ce∣cilia
had too much good sense, and too much acknow∣ledgment
for her deserving lover, to propose unne∣cessary
<PB N="158" REF="333"/>
delays. She had already yielded her consent,
and Sir George Bidulph availing himself of Mrs.
Arnold's last request, that the marriage should not
be deferred, he prevailed on his niece to fix the time
before he left her; and in a month afterwards my
lord V—had the happiness to receive the <HI>willing</HI>
hand of the most charming of women from her de∣lighted
friends. Lady Sarah and Sir George came
down on purpose to assist at the ceremony, and Mr.
Price had the satisfaction of joining a pair, formed
for, and worthy of each other.</P>
<P>My lord V—set out with his lady the day after
their marriage for V—hall in Kent▪ the antient seat
of his family; the place where Mrs. Arnold's first
acquaintance had commenced with the excellent
parents of this worthy lord. Miss Arnold accom∣panied
them, and seemed to quit with pleasure a
place which served only to remind her of her grief.</P>
<P>My lord and lady V—earnestly sollicited Mr. Price
to take this journey with them, and to continue to
them what he had been to Mrs. Arnold, the friend, com∣panion
and instructor; but the good old man begged
they would dispense with him, saying he wished to
pass the short remains of his life with his beloved and
only child Mrs. Main; from whom nothing but his
gratitude and attachment to Mrs. Arnold could have
drawn him. His noble friends were obliged to acqui∣esce.
He staid but a few days at Woodberry after
their departure, in order to regulate some of their
domestic affairs, that they had left to his care. He
then repaired to London to pass the evening of his
days with a daughter and son-in law, who are highly
deserving of all his tenderness.</P>
<P>Mrs. Spillman, who would never take the name of
Audley, retired about the same time to her friends in
Buckinghamshire.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland had during this interim stood his trial
for the death of Sir Edward Audley, and was, on the
evidence of Mr. Bendish, acquitted. He immediately
withdrew privately from England without bidding
<PB N="159" REF="334"/>
adieu to one of his friends, and as he had before
resolved, joined the army in quality of a volunteer.
My lord V—himself was obliged soon to follow him,
and to quit his amiable lady at a time when he found
himself more than ever passionately devoted to her;
for the title of husband had but served to make him
discover that she deserved his friendship and his confi∣dence,
as well as his admiration.</P>
<P>Lady V—, who determined to remain at her seat
in Kent till his lordship's return, which was at that
time uncertain, recommended with a sweet ingenu∣ousness,
Mr. Falkland to her lord's care. If it be in
your power, said she, advance his fortune, and pro∣mote
his glory; your generosity promised me this at
a time when he possessed the heart that is now wholly
your's; I hope you will not have less attention to him,
now that I consider him only as a brother.</P>
<P>Lord V—returned to England after the close of
the campaign, in which Mr. Falkland had distinguished
himself so as to gain the reputation of singular brave∣ry.
An event had also happened in his own country
during his absence, by which he saw himself very un∣expectedly
restored to the inheritance of his ancestors.</P>
<P>The person who had succeeded to the greatest part
of his father's estate was but a distant relation; he was
an old man and unmarried, and now dying without
heirs, he from a principle of justice bequeathed to
young Falkland the fortune which he had possessed
in consequence of his father's misfortunes.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold was not as yet perfectly recovered from
her former malady; some traces of it still remained,
which her friends, however, had hopes that time would
dissipate. A gentleman of high rank and fortune in
that country, who had casually seen her a few times,
became passionately in love with her, and found means
to acquaint lady V—with his sentiments: who think∣ing
that an amiable and deserving lover would, sooner
than any thing else, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach her sister's heart from its
former unhappy ties, and consequently restore her
mind to its right frame, received with satisfaction his
<PB N="160" REF="335"/>
declaration, and promised at her lord's return that he
should be permited to visit Miss Arnold. She spoke
of him in the mean while to her sister in the most ad∣vantageous
terms; but found her utterly averse to the
thoughts of a new engagement. Lady V—, how∣ever,
was not without hopes of overcoming by de∣grees
a repugnance which she considered only as the
result of disappointment; and on her lord's arrival
she was in haste to communicate the affair to him. She
enlarged, in her sister's presence, on the merit, the
passion, and the considerable proposals of Miss Ar∣nold's
lover; and added, smiling, she hoped he
would have his lordship's interest to promote his suit.</P>
<P>I approve highly of the gentleman, said lord V—,
and should think it a happiness to have a man of his
worth and consideration united to our family; but
before I engage in his cause, I must acquit myself of
a commission which I promised Mr. Falkland I would
faithfully fulfil.</P>
<P>He then informed the two ladies of the acquisition
Mr. Falkland had just received to his fortune. It
was an estate of four thousand pounds a year. Falk∣land,
said he, though I had made it my business to seek
him out, had always avoided me; nor do I believe we
should ever have had any correspondence, had it not
been for this event. He wrote to me a few days before
my departure from Germany, and here is his letter.
My lord V—read it aloud to both the ladies.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland began with beseeching lord V—to
blot from his memory his past ill conduct, for which
he expressed the sincerest contrition; and acknowledg∣ing
with the utmost gratitude his obligations to lord
V—, owned that shame would not permit him
to do it personally. He then informs him of the large
fortune which was just fallen to him, and proceeds
in these words: “Were it not for this event, I should
wish that my very name might be forgotten, and that
Miss Arnold should never more call back to her re∣collection
<PB N="161" REF="336"/>
the man who deserves nothing from her
but contempt and aversion. I acknowledge, my
lord, I <HI>deserve</HI> nothing else from her, and must even
applaud her justice, if the distinction with which
she once honoured me is turned into disdain: but, if
on the contrary the same fatality which first impelled,
should still persist in attaching her inclinations to so
unworthy an object, tell her I lay myself at her feet
not to make her an atonement, it would be a propha∣nation
of the word to use it on this occasion; but to
deliver myself up to her justice, and to endue her
with a power (pardon the boldness of the expression)
like that of Omnipotence, either to pardon and re∣ward
the repenting sinner, or to condemn him to
punishment.”</P>
<P>“If she pronounces the latter sentence, I may com∣plain;
but cannot condemn her. If the former,
tell her, my lord, she shall find that a man whose
heart has been early impressed by principles of vir∣tue,
however he may by passions have been hurried
into vice, cannot remain long a slave to it; and that
her mildness, her sweet patience, and unexampled
tenderness are able to kindle an affection stronger and
more lasting, than her beauty, captivating as it is,
could ever inspire.”</P>
<P>“I have mentioned to you, my lord, the fortune
of which I am now possessed, not as a circumstance
which can give me the least merit with Miss Arnold,
or that I think can in the smallest degree intitle me
to her consideration; but to obviate the lightest sus∣picion
which her friends might entertain, that in∣terest
could have any share in the declaration I now
make. I consider it indeed as the most precious
advantage which I can derive from this unlooked for
benefit, that it permits me to discover those secret
wishes which would otherwise have remained for
ever hid within my own breast.”</P>
<P>He concludes with most earnestly conjuring Lord
V—to acquaint Miss Arnold with his sentiments, and
to communicate to him her's on this important
subject.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="337"/>
Lord V—having finished reading the letter, It
rests on you, madam, said he to Miss Arnold, to give
an answer to Mr. Falkland. I have acquitted my∣self
of my duly; but I would have you take a little
time to consider.—Consult your own heart, my dear,
said lady V—; I believe <HI>that</HI> after all must deter∣mine
you.</P>
<P>Miss Arnold turned towards her sister; and addres∣sing
her with a sober and even commanding air, No,
Cecilia, said she, I <HI>will</HI> not consult my heart, <HI>that</HI> has.
already betrayed me. I will consult my reason, since
Heaven has been pleased to restore it to me) I will
consult my honour; those are the guides that shall
henceforward direct your sister's actions. My lord,
the subject requires <HI>no</HI> consideration; you shall know
my sentiments this moment.</P>
<P>I loved Falkland from my childhood; but conscious
that we were never meant for each other, I endeavour∣ed
to stifle a fatal passion, the consequences of which
I had so much reason to dread. I could not succeed
in my attempt, and then I had no resource left, but
to resolve without divulging it to die a martyr to my
own imprudence. I was baffled in this design too, my
secret was unhappily discovered, and cruelly betrayed.
Yet at the same time was I deceived into a belief that
I was tenderly beloved. This belief, as it mitigated
the shame I suffered from my own acknowledged weak∣ness,
so did it serve to strengthen an affection already
but too deeply rooted in my heart; and when from
Falkland's own lips I received a confirmation of what
I had before been flattered with from others, I had not
resolution enough to defend myself from giving him
(however contrary to my duty) the faith he desired. I
knew not at the time I made it by what means I should
be enabled to perform my promise; but we were both
very young. He was designed for the army. I was
in hopes that time, and his good conduct, might influ∣ence
my uncle Bidulph in his favour; and for my dear
mama, whose natural softness, joined to her fondness
for Mr. Falkland, left her heart as it were open to
<PB N="163" REF="338"/>
the assault, I thought to have engaged you my sister,
Mr. Price, and Mrs. B—to have worked upon her
tenderness; and when you, my good lord V—, first
proposed to us the honour of your alliance, I thought
in you too to have obtained a powerful advocate.
These were my hopes, and upon the strength of these
I ventured to swear I never would be the wife of any
other man—Falkland, I never will! cried she, stretch∣ing
out her arms as if he stood before her. Lord and
lady V—were startled at her action, and looked at
each other; when she proceeded, as if still addressing
herself to Falkland; Yet observe I do not violate my
oath, when I declare I never will be <HI>your's.</HI> I here
(raising up solemnly her hands and eyes) devote
myself in the sight of Heaven and these my friends to
a single life. How truly I have loved you, let my
whole conduct witness. My tenderness was proof a∣gainst
a thousand marks of coldness and neglect. Your
infidelity, avowed even under your own hand, could
not shake my constancy; nay, even madness itself did
not dispossess you of my heart! But the first thing
that my recovered reason dictates me is, that I <HI>ought</HI>
not to be your wife. I owe this sacrifice (for such I
acknowledge it) to all my friends; but <HI>above</HI> all to
the honoured memory of my mama. I cannot <HI>atone</HI>
for my disobedience; 'tis fit I should punish myself
for it. Yet 'tis a great consolation to me, that I have
it in my power to refuse that reparation which you
now offer to make me. Then recovering from the
transport in which she appeared as it were to have
been rapt, and addressing herself to my lord V—,
You have now, my lord, heard my final determina∣tion,
said she; I have only to add, that I beg you
will let Mr. Falkland know what it is.</P>
<P>However lord and lady V—might in their hearts
approve her resolution, they nevertheless said nothing
to strengthen her in it. Lord V—thought he owed
thus much to Mr. Falkland, who had requested his
interposition.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="339"/>
As the declaration Miss Arnold had made on this
occasion, was the first regular explanation she had
ever entered into upon the subject, so was this the
first time since her own misfortune that she had ever
shewed herself thoroughly mistress of her faculties;
but as the loss of the man she had so perfectly loved
had at first deprived her of them, so it seemed as if the
having him restored to her (for that he should be so,
depended entirely on herself) had in a great measure
recalled to her the full possession of them; for it was
observed that from that time she every day appeared
more and more to recover her former judgment and
tranquillity, and in a little while she was perfectly re∣stored,
though she ever retained a soft melancholy,
which time itself could not subdue. She kept her
word faithfully; for she afterwards refused several
considerable matches, preserving in her heart an in∣violable
attachment to her first ill-fated choice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, obliged to submit to this second, and
more affecting disappointment, returned not to En∣gland
for many years. He afterwards rose to a distin∣guished
rank in the army; but ever tenderly regret∣ting
the loss of Miss Arnold, he, in imitation of her,
declared his resolution of continuing single. They<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Askham, dates her Memoirs in the year 1738.</NOTE>
are both so at the time these memoirs are written,
and will probably remain so to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>Miss Audley and her mother made choice of a re∣mote
province in France for their retreat, to which
they withdrew soon after the death of Mrs. Arnold;
not, as Miss Audley had declared, from any disincli∣nation
to remain in England, but because the state of
their affairs made a scheme of frugality absolutely ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>Miss Audley, before her departure, left in the hands
of a friend all those letters that had passed between
her and her brother that have appeared in this collec∣tion,
as well as those which Sir Edward had received
from Mr. Falkland; and Mr. Falkland himself had,
<PB N="165" REF="340"/>
immediately after his leaving Woodberry for the last
time, sent to Mr. Price those which Sir Edward Aud∣ley
had written to him; and it was by this means
that they have been collected together.</P>
<P>Lady Audley died after about three years residence
in France. Her join are reverting to her younger son,
a youth whom she had left in England, Miss Audley
found herself so streightened in her circumstances,
that she thought it prudent to retire into a convent;
where the religious in less than a year prevailed on her
to turn Roman Catholic, and soon after to become
one of their community. Mrs. Askam says she knew
a gentleman who was present when this unhappy
young lady made her profession in a convent of Car∣thusian
nuns, one of the most severe orders in the
Romish Church.</P>
<P>She concludes her history with many serious reflec∣tions,
which though extremely pious and rational,
the editor chuses to omit, thinking it a compliment
due to the judgment of his readers to leave them to
make reflections for themselves.</P>
