<HEAD>GERMANY.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of DIEPHOLT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county lies south of Delmenhorst, between Hoya on the east, and Osnabrug on the west. It is about twelve miles in length, and five in breadth, consisting mostly of moors and heath, with a little arable-land. For fuel the inhabitants make use of turf. The lake, called Dummersee, abounds with fish and wild ducks. In the county are four boroughs, and about one thousand nine hundred fire-places. The inhabitants make a coarse linen, and also a coarse kind of woollen, in which, and black cat∣tle, they have some traffic. Their religion is Lutheranism. In the matricula, the king of Great-Britain is taxed for this county at one horse and four foot, or twenty-eight florins, monthly; but in respect of the chamber-judicatory, it is in∣cluded
<PB N="4" REF="30"/>
in the sum paid for the whole electorate. It has seat and voice in the college of the West∣phalian counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. The taxes are much the same as in the county of Hoya, except that it pays no magazine∣corn money. The districts of Auburg and Wa∣genfeld, in this county, are possessed, at present, by the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel; but his right to them is disputed by the king of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Deepholt, from which the county takes its name, and the only place in it worth mentioning, is a large borough, situated on the Hunte.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of SPIEGELBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This small county makes a part of the principa∣lity of Calenberg; but the prince of Orange, he∣reditary stadtholder of the United Provinces, holds it of the elector of Hanover, as superior. Both the civil and ecclesiastical judicatories are subordi∣nate to those of Brunswic-Lunenburg. The coun∣ty also contributes its quota towards the mainte∣nance of the troops of Brunswic-Lunenburg. The elector, as superior of the county, has a seat and voice in the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. Its quota of the imperial and circle taxes is included in that of Calenberg.</P>
<P>Spiegelberg, from which the county takes its name, and the only place in it worth notice, is an antient castle on a mountain, in which the counts formerly had their residence. Near it is an hospital for old women, and a chapel, to which many pilgrimages are made, on account of an image of the virgin.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="5" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>The COUNTY RIETBERG, or RITTBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the south by the county of Lippe, to the north by that of Ravens∣berg, to the east by the bishopric of Paderborn, and to the west by that of Osnabrug. Its greatest length is about seventeen miles, and breadth about six. The soil, for the most part, consists of heath. Count Kaunitz-Rietberg, who is proprietor of the county, holding it as a fief of Hesse, enjoys both seat and voice in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. His assessment to the empire is six horse, or seventy-two florins, monthly, in lieu of them; and to the chamber-court he pays, each term, seventy rix-dollars, forty-nine kruitzers.</P>
<P>Rietberg, from which the county takes its name, is a small town on the Ems, near which, on the same river, is the castle of Eden.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of PYRMONT.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the north and east by the Hanoverian district of Erzen, to the south and west by the Wolfenbuttel district of Ottenstein, a part of Hanover, the county of Lippe, and the bishopric of Paderborn. It is about twelve miles both in length and breadth, and consists mostly of a beautiful valley, surrounded by high green hills, in which is a salt-work, the celebrated mine∣ral springs, and steel waters. On one of the high∣est of the hills are to be seen the ruins of Hermans, or Harmin's burg, a fort, which took its name from the antient German general Arminius. The inhabitants of this county are Lutherans, and have a superintendent at the new town of Pyrmont. By
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
a stipulation with the bishopric of Paderborn, in 1668, it was agreed, that in case the male-stock of the house of Waldeck, to whom this county belongs, should become extinct, the bishop should succeed, on payment of twenty thousand rix-dollars, to the daughters of Waldeck. At the same time the seigniory of Lugde, or Lude, was ceded to the bishopric. This county entitles its lord to a seat and voice, in the college of counts, at the diets of the empire, and circle. In the ma∣tricula he is assessed at fourteen florins, and to the chamber-court, at seventeen rix-dollars, sixty∣seven kruitzers, each term. His revenue from this county amounts to about thirty thousand rix-dol∣lars, arising chiefly from the mineral-waters and salt-work. The only place in it of any note is the New Town of Pyrmont, near which is a citadel, fortified with a broad ditch, high ramparts, and subterraneous passages and vaults. On the north side of the town is a good stone quarry, and in that a pit, resembling the grotto del Cane near Na∣ples; over which, in 1720, a stone vault was built. But that for which it is most famous are its mineral-waters, issuing from several springs in the neighbourhood. That chiefly used for drink∣ing has a house built over it. Another, called in German the Brodelbrun, or the Bubbling-spring, from the noise it makes, has hitherto been used only for bathing. There is a great resort to these chaly∣beate waters, which are even preferred to those of the Spaw, and exported in large quantities from Bremen, whither they are sent by the Weser, be∣sides what is carried over land, and drank at the fountain-head. Close by the well-house is a ball and assembly-room.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of GRONSFELD.</HEAD>
<P>This little district lying in the duchy of Lim∣burg, not far from the Maes, was first erected into a county by the emperor Rodolph II. Its counts have a seat and voice in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. To the courts of the empire they con∣tribute, each term, ten rix-dollars, sixty kruit∣zers. In this rate the seigniory of Schlenacken is not included.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of RECKHEIM, or RECKUM.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is an imperial female fief, is separated by the Maes from the duchy of Lim∣bourg, being bounded on the other sides by the bishopric of Liege, and the territory of the town of Maestricht. It was first raised to the dignity of a county in the year 1623, and belongs at present to the counts of Aspermont, who, on account of it, have a seat and voice in the Westphalian col∣lege of the counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. Their assessment for it to the cham∣ber-court is fifty-two rix-dollars, forty-five kruit∣zers, each term.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of ANHOLT.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies between the bishopric of Munster, the duchy of Cleve, and the county of Zutphen. It belongs to the prince of Salm, who, on account of it, enjoys both seat and voice in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. This seigniory is not to be found in the matricula of the empire;
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
but in that of the circle of Westphalia, it is rated at twelve florins. It was of old a fief of Guelders, and the low country province of that name still considers it as such.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORIES of WINNEN∣BURG and BIELSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>These seigniories lie in the archbishopric of Treves, of which they are fiefs, between the Mos∣selle and Hundsruck. They belong to the house of Metternich, which, on account of them, enjoys seat and voice, both in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. Their assessment in the matricula is one horse, or twelve florins; and to the chamber-court, eight rix-dollars, nine kruitzers, each term.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOLZAPFEL.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the river Lahn, and is sur∣rounded by the territories of the elector of Treves, and those of Nassau-Dietz. It was raised to the dignity of an immediate imperial county in the year 1643. The prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Hoym, who is proprietor of the county, enjoys, on ac∣count of it, both seat and voice in the Westpha∣lian college of the counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. Its assessment to the em∣pire and circle is fifteen florins, and to the cham∣ber-court thirteen rix-dollars, eighty-six kruitzers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORIES of WITTEM, EYSS, and SCHLENACKEN.</HEAD>
<P>These seigniories lie in the duchy of Limburg, and belong to the counts of Plattenburg. By virtue of the first, which is allodial, the count is a mem∣ber
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
of the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and also has a seat and voice at the diets of the circle. Its assessment to the empire is four∣teen florins.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Eysz, or Eisz, which was pur∣chased by the count in 1722, is so small, that it yields not quite six hundred rix-dollars to its lord annually. The count of Plattenberg, on ac∣count of these seigniories, is taxed at twenty rix-dollars, fifty kruitzers, to the chamber-court of the empire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTIES of BLANKEN∣HEIM and GEROLSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>These counties lie in the archbishopric of Treves, and belong to the count of Manderschied-Blan∣kenheim and Gerolstein, who, by virtue of them, is a member of the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire. They are taxed in the ma∣tricula at two horse and ten foot, or sixty-four florins; and at seventy-two rix-dollars, fifty-four kruitzers, each term, to the chamber-court. Be∣sides these counties, there are some seigniories near them, which belong also to the house of Manders∣chied.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of GEHMEN.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies in the bishopric of Munster, and had antiently lords of its own. It belongs at present to a branch of the house of Limburg-Styrum, and is an immediate free imperial seigniory. The count of Limburg-Styrum, as lord of Gehmen, is a member of the Westphalian college
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
of counts of the empire, and has also a seat and voice at the diets of the circle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of GIMBORN and NEUSTADT.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory is surrounded by the counties of the Mark and Homberg, and the duchies of Berg and Westphalia. It is a free imperial seig∣niory belonging to the count of Swartzenberg, who has confirmed to his protestant subjects the free exercise of their religion, pursuant to an en∣gagement entered into with them in 1658. He has, on account of this seigniory, a seat and voice in the Westphalian college of counts of the em∣pire, and at the diets of the circle. To the army of the empire and circle, his quota for it is two horse and seven foot. The only places worth mentioning in the seigniory are,</P>
<P>Gimborn, a castle on the borders of the duchy of Berg, from which the seigniory takes its name.</P>
<P>Neustadt, a small town, from which this seig∣niory is also denominated. In 1742 and 1746, it was almost entirely destroyed by fire. In the pa∣rish of Gummersbach and the district of Neustadt, are founderies of iron, copper, and lead, and also a manufacture of cotton. In other places of the seigniory, they likewise spin cotton, and trade in iron.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of WICKERAD.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies on the river Niers, and is surrounded by the duchy of Juliers and the bi∣shopric of Cologn. The count of Quadt is its proprietor, who was first raised to the rank of a count of the empire in the year 1752, and as such is a member of the Westphalian college of counts
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
of the empire, and has a seat and voice at the diets of the circle. For the defence of the em∣pire, his assessment is four foot, or sixteen florins.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of MYLENDONK.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies also on the river Niers, not far from the former; it belongs to the count of Ostein, who, on that account, is a member of the Westphalian college of counts of the empire and has a seat and voice at the diets of the circle. His assessment towards the army of the empire, is four foot, or sixteen florins; and towards the chamber-court four rix-dollars each term.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of REICHEN∣STEIN.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies in the duchy of Juliers, and belongs to the baron of Nesselrode, who, on ac∣count of it, was raised in 1702, to the dignity of a count of the empire, and, as such, now enjoys a seat and voice in the Westphalian college of the counts thereof, and at the diets of the circle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of KERPEN and LOM∣MERSUM.</HEAD>
<P>This county consists of the two seigniories of the same name, lying in the duchy of Juliers, and belonging to the count of Schasberg, who is there∣by entitled to a seat and voice in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. His assessment towards the army of the empire is twelve florins. Kerpen, the capital of the county, is a considerable borough with a castle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="12" REF="110"/>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of SCHLEIDEN.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is almost surrounded by the duchies of Juliers and Luxemburg, belongs to the counts of the Mark, who are thereby en∣titled to a seat and voice in the Westphalian col∣lege of counts of the empire, and also in the diets of the circle. Its assessment, for the defence of the empire, is twelve rix-dollars, and for the maintenance of the chamber-court, eighty-seven rix-dollars, forty-five kruitzers. Schleiden, which gives name to it, is a small borough with a castle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of HALLERMUND.</HEAD>
<P>This was antiently an imperial county, but was afterwards incorporated with the principality of Calenberg. However, king George I. having invested the count of Plate and his male-issue therewith, the count, upon that, undertook to furnish two foot to the army of the empire, and was admitted as a member thereof at the imperial and circle diets.</P>
<P>The following seigniories are also reckoned in the circle of Westphalia; but have neither seat nor voice at the diets of the circle, though they are rated in the matricula, viz.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Dyck, which lies in the arch∣bishopric of Cologne, and belongs to a branch of the house of Salm Reifferschied.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Mechernich, which lies in the duchy of Juliers, and belongs to the house of Nesselrod, which, on account of it, contributes each term to the chamber-court, two rix-dollars, four kruitzers.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Schonau, which belongs to the lords of Blauche.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="120"/>
The seigniory of Wylre, which lies in the duchy of Limburg, and belongs to the lords of Bodden.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Richold, which lies also in the duchy of Limburg, and belongs to the barons of Bongard, of Paffendorf.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Dreysz, which lies in the arch∣bishopric of Treves, between the rivers Salm and Liser, and consists of the single village of Dreysz, belonging to the abbey of Echternach, or Epter∣nach, in the duchy of Luxemburg.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Jever, which is bounded to the south by East Friesland, and the county of Oldenburg; to the north by the German sea; to the east by the Jade, and the lordship of Knip∣hausen; and to the west by the Harlingerland and East Friesland. It is upwards of a dozen miles both in length and breadth, and yields excellent pasturage; in consequence of which it has a good breed of cattle and horses, with butter and cheese, not inferior to the Dutch. It is well supplied with turf for fuel, but is much exposed to inun∣dations from the sea; to guard against which, dykes have been erected at a considerable expence. The prince of Anhalt-Zerbst is proprietor of this seigniory, and stiles himself lord of Jever and Kniphausen; but enjoys neither seat nor voice on account of it at the diets of the empire, or cir∣cle. To the chamber-court, its assessment is forty rix-dollars. The town of Jever, from which the seigniory takes its name, is pretty large, standing in a fertile spot, and having a strong castle.</P>
<P>The lordship of Kniphausen, which borders on that of Jever, and consists of good marsh-land, in which a great number of horses and black cat∣tle are bred and fed, belongs to count Bentinck, being a fief of Burgundy, and a free lordship, in∣vested with territorial jurisdiction. Count Ben∣tinck
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
also, in right of his countess, has several manors in the seigniory of Jever.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of COLOGNE, or COLEN,</HEAD>
<P>This city, called in Latin Colonia Agrippina, and Ubiorum, and by the Germans Kewlen, stands on the Rhine, twenty miles south-east of Dussel∣dorp, sixty east of Maestricht, sixty-eight north of Triers, seventy south of Munster, eighty-two north-west of Mentz and Nimeguen, one hundred from Brussels and Antwerp, and one hundred and twenty from Amsterdam. It is one of the oldest and largest, as well as most antient cities in all Germany, and derives its present name from that of Colonia, given it by the Romans, under whom it was the capi∣tal of Germania Secunda. It is a free imperial city, governed by its own senate, in respect to civil mat∣ters and causes; but the criminal jurisdiction belongs to the elector and his chapter. In the magnificent, but unfinished cathedral of St. Peter, is a tomb, in which the three wise men are said to be interred. Besides the cathedral, there are ten collegiate, and nineteen parish churches, four abbies, seventeen monasteries, thirty-nine nunneries, sixteen hospi∣tals, and about fifty chapels. Here is a very flourishing university, re-established by Urban VI. in 1388. Tho' the elector, by his officers, ad∣ministers justice in all criminal causes, yet so jea∣lous are the citizens of him, that they will not per∣mit him, in person, to reside above three days at a time in the city, nor to come into it with a great train. For this reason he commonly resides at Bonne. In 755 Cologne was made an archbishop∣ric, and in 1260 entered into the Hanseatic league. It has the precedence of all the imperial cities, and is fortified, but in the antient manner; so that it
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
might be easily taken by whoever was master of the field. Most of the inhabitants are papists; but there are also many protestants, who repair to the neighbouring town of Mulheim, in the duchy of Berg, for public worship. Its trade, which is considerable, especially in Rhenish wine, is chiefly in the hands of the protestants, and carried on by the Rhine. The ships, wherewith they trade to the Netherlands, are of a particular form, and considerable burthen. In the council-house, which is a large Gothic building, are many fine paintings, together with bows, arrows, bucklers, and all sorts of antique arms, particularly a cross-bow of whalebone, twelve feet long, eight inches broad, and four inches thick. In the church of St. Ur∣sula, they pretend to shew her tomb, and the bones of the eleven thousand pretended virgin-martyrs, tho' that story is entirely owing to a mistake. The heads of some of these imaginary martyrs are kept in cases of silver, others are covered with stuffs of gold, and some have caps of cloth of gold and velvet. Brevat says, he saw between four and five thousand sculls, decked with garlands and coro∣nets, and ranged on shelves. The city swears al∣legiance and homage to a new elector, so long as he continues to protect them in their just rights and privileges. The university is under its juris∣diction. The canonesses of St. Ursula, who must be all countesses, have a handsome income, ex∣clusive of offerings. In their church they pretend to shew three of the thorns of our Saviour's crown, and one of the vessels that contained the water, which he converted into wine, at the marriage of Cana. In the church of St. Gereon are nine hun∣dred heads of Moorish cavaliers, said to have been in the army of Constantine, before it was convert∣ed to Christianity, and to have been beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to idols. Every one of the
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
heads has a cap of scarlet, adorned with pearls. In the Jesuits college are the portraits of the thir∣teen first generals of the order, with Ignatius Loy∣ala at their head, and in their church, which is the finest in Cologne, are many fine statues, with an amazing quantity of rich silver-plate; and the uten∣sils for mass are all of gold, enriched with precious stones. In the Cordeliers-church is the tomb of the famous Duns Scotus, surnamed doctor Sub∣tilis, with this epitaph: <HI>Scotia me genuit, Anglia me suscepit, Gallia me docuit, Colonia me tenet.</HI> The three kings, or wisemen, lie in a large purple shrine, spangled with gold, set up on a pedestal of brass, in the middle of a square mausoleum, faced within and without with marble and jasper. It is opened every morning at nine o'clock, if two of the canons of the cathedral are present, when these kings are seen lying at full length, with their heads bedecked with a crown of gold, garnished with precious stones. Their names, which are Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, are in purple characters, upon a little grate, of the same metal with that before the shrine, which is adorned with an infinite number of large, rich pearls and pre∣cious stones, particularly an oriental topaz, as big as a pigeon's egg, valued at above thirty thousand crowns. Over against them are six large branches of silver, with wax candles, which burn night and day. The bones of these men, we are told, were brought to Constantinople, by Helena, the mo∣ther of Constantine; from thence to Milan, by Eustorpius, bishop of that see, and afterwards hither by archbishop Rainold. The clergy here are vastly numerous, and have plentiful revenues, but very little to do. The city is said to have up∣wards of twenty gates; but the streets, in general, are dirty and badly paved, and the windows com∣posed of small round bits of glass. Baron Polnitz
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
says, that, tho' it is one of the greatest cities, it is one of the most melancholy in Europe, there be∣ing nothing to be seen but priests, friars, and stu∣dents, many of whom beg alms with a song, and nothing to be heard but the tolling of bells. He says also, that there are as many churches and cha∣pels in it as days in the year, that there are very few families of quality, that the vulgar are ex∣tremely clownish, and that the noblemen of the chapter stay no longer in town than their duty obliges them. Mr. Wright, in his Travels, says, that the women go veiled; and that the best gene∣va, or gin, is that distilled here from the berries of juniper-trees, which grow in great numbers in the neighbourhood. As a free imperial city, it has a seat and voice at the diets of the empire and circle. In those of the empire, it has the first place on the Rhenish bench. Towards the defence of the em∣pire, its assessment is eight hundred and twenty∣five florins; and towards the maintenance of the chamber-court, four hundred and five rix-dollars, seventy-two and a half kruitzers, each term. Its militia consists of four companies of foot, who keep guard at the gates.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</HEAD>
<P>This city, called in Latin Aquisgranum, A∣quae, or Urbs Aquensis; by the Germans Aachen, Achen, and Aach; by the French Aix-la-Cha∣pelle, stands fifteen miles north-east of Limbourg, thirteen south-west of Juliers, twenty-eight east of Maestricht, twenty-six east of Liege, twenty-eight south-west of Cologne, and about twenty north-east of the Spaw. Its German and Latin names are probably derived from its warm baths, for which it was famous even in the time of the Ro∣mans.
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
That of Aquisgranum is supposed to be derived from Serenius Granus, lieutenant-general of Gallia Belgica, who having discovered the springs here in 53, built baths after the Roman fashion, and a palace near them; but the city having been destroyed by the Huns, lay in ruins, till it was re∣built by Charlemagne, who made it the seat of his empire on this side the Alps, building a palace, repairing the baths, and ordaining, that the future kings of the Romans should be crowned here with an iron crown, at Milan with one of silver, and at Rome with one of gold; which, tho' observed for a while, hath been long since disused. This city, however, is reckoned the principal of the impe∣rial cities, and is the place where the emperor ought to be crowned, and also where he ought to reside. Accordingly it calls itself, and by the Roman emperors and kings, is called, the Royal Chair, i. e. the throne, or residence, and free city of the Holy Roman Empire, having the keeping, and that properly, in the church of St. Mary, founded by Charlemagne, of a part of the jewels of the empire, which are commonly used at the coronation of a Roman king, or emperor, namely, of Charlemagne's sword, a book of the Gospels, and a golden casket set with precious stones, where∣in is kept some of the earth, on which the blood of St. Stephen dropt at his martyrdom. Here, in 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, was concluded that famous treaty between France and Spain, and another very lately between France and Great-Britain. Many councils were held at this place in the time of Charlemagne and Lewis the Pious. The greatest part of the inha∣bitants are Roman catholics; but there are also many protestants, both Lutherans and Calvinists, who are obliged to go to church to Vaels, about two miles off, in that part of the duchy of Lim∣burg which is subject to the Dutch. The circuit
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
of the whole city is about a league and a half, and that called the inner, or little town, about three quar∣ters. The town house is one of the finest in Germany, being adorned with the statues of all the emperors since Charlemagne, and with curious history-paint∣ings. In the city are about twenty religious orders, whose houses take up almost one-third of that called the Little Town. Every regent Roman emperor is a sworn canon of St. Mary's church, or the cathedral, according to the example and appointment of Charlemagne; and as by the Golden Bull the co∣ronation of the emperors is ordained to be here, whenever they are crowned at Franckfort, as they have been ever since Maximilian I. they protest it shall be without prejudice to the privileges of this city. The cathedral is a large old fashioned Gothic pile, which was consecrated by Leo III. in presence of Charlemagne, and three hundred and sixty-five bishops. Under the altar of the choir lies the body of Charlemagne, with a white marble tomb stone over it. The chief rarities and relics in this church are, 1st, The gown or shift worn by the Virgin Mary at the birth of our Saviour. 2d, A coarse linen cloth, pretended to have been girt about our Saviour on the cross. 3d, A piece of the cord he was bound with. 4th, Some of the blood of the proto-martyr St. Stephen, richly in∣chased in gold and precious stones, on which the emperors are sworn at their inauguration. 5th, A picture of the Virgin Mary, with our Saviour in her arms, embossed on a jasper, about two inches broad, and pretended to be the work of St. Luke. 6th, A manuscript copy of the Gospels, in golden letters, in a cover of silver gilt. Besides these, here is a number of other curiosities, which we have not room to particularize. There are a great many mineral springs, both hot and cold, in and about the city, much frequented by the English, and most other Eu∣ropean
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
nations, and used, some for bathing, and others for drinking. The virtues of the waters are much the same as those of Bath in Somerset∣shire; but the water of some of them is a great deal hotter. They are impregnated with sulphur, salt, nitre, saltpetre, and alum, and give relief in a great variety of maladies. They are unpleasant to the taste at first, and most of them have an offen∣sive smell. The first season for them begins about the middle of May, and the second about the mid∣dle of August, and each continues about six weeks. The baths are, in general, neat and commodious, the accommodations and provisions good and reasonable, and there is a great variety of the best company. The city has for its protectors, the emperor, and the elector Palatine, as duke of Ju∣liers. Its manufactures are those of copper and brass wares, and of cloth. Round the city lies a district, which is under its jurisdiction, and is beau∣tifully diversified with mountains, woods, and vineyards. At a little distance from it is the free imperial foundation of Bortschied, of the Cistercian order, whose abbess has a seat and voice at the diet of the empire. The abbey, with its seigniory, are under the protection of the city of Aix-la-Chapelle, the former standing at the charming vil∣lage of Bortchied, or Portchied, in which are like∣wise many hot springs and baths. These have no disagreeable smell, and are not only bathed in, but drank. The reliques in the great minster-church in the city, are shewn only at the jubilee, once in seven years, or at the request of some great person∣age, when they are taken out, and put in, in the presence of the whole senate and chapter. The windows of this church are curiously gilt, and its pavement is of chequered marble. It contains also an immense treasure of vessels of gold and silver gilt, copes embroidered with pearl, and
<PB N="21" REF="200"/>
other rich vestments. The four first reliques men∣tioned above are kept in a chest of silver and gold, curiously engraved. At the entrance of the choir is a pulpit covered with plates of gold and silver, and adorned with precious stones. The altar also of the choir is covered with plates of gold, repre∣senting our Saviour's passion; and in the upper part of the church is a throne, or chair, of white marble, supposed to have been placed there by the emperor Charlemagne, in which the emperors used to sit, when they were consecrated, and re∣ceived the homage of the electors and chapter. Aix la-Chapelle, being an imperial free city, has a seat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle. Its assessment in the matricula is only one hundred florins; and its quota towards the mainte∣nance of the chamber-court, one hundred and fifty∣five rix-dollars, fifty kruitzers, each term.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of DORTMUND.</HEAD>
<P>This city, in Latin Tremonia, lies in the coun∣ty of the Mark, thirty-four miles south of Munster, and is pretty large, but not very well built. It is an imperial city, and, as such, enjoys both seat and voice at the diets of the circle, and also at those of the empire, on the Rhenish bench of the col∣lege of the imperial cities. Its assessment in the matricula is ninety-six florins, and to the chamber∣court, each term, one hundred and eight rix-dol∣lars, twenty and a half kruitzers. Dortmund was formerly one of the Hanse-towns. Its territory also was formerly a county, and had lords of its own; but since 1504, hath been entirely possessed by the city. Here are four Lutheran churches, one nunnery, two monasteries, and one of the three archigymnasia, as they are called, of West∣phalia. The city is populous and rich, having a
<PB N="22" REF="210"/>
good trade, and a communication with the Rhine, by the river Empser, and being only about six miles distant from the Lippe, on one side, and the Roer, on the other.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>THE CIRCLE of the LOWER RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded by that of Westpha∣lia, the Upper-Rhine, Franconia, Swabia, and Burgundy; as also by Lorrain and Alsace, dividing the circle of the Upper-Rhine. The states thereof are the three spiritual electors, the elector Palatine, the duke of Aremberg, the prince of Taxis, the Teutonic bailiwic of Coblenz, the prince of Nassau-Dietz, on account of the seigniory of Beilstein, the elector of Treves, on account of Lower-Isenburgh, and the count of Sinzendorf, on account of the burgraviate of Rheineck. The independency of the town of Gelnhausen is disputed. The diets of this circle are held at Frankfort on the Maine; and the elec∣tor of Mentz is the summoning prince and director of it. It is one of those called the Anterior-Circles; and its contribution to the empire has generally been equal to that of the Upper-Rhine. With respect to religion, it is reckoned among the mixed.</P>

<HEAD>MENTZ.</HEAD>
<P>The dominions of the elector of Mentz are, in general, fruitful. The proper archbishopric yields corn, cattle, excellent wines and fruits, especially almonds, chesnuts, and filberts; and in some places good salt, flax, and tobacco, iron mines, and plenty of wood. The principal rivers by which it is watered are the Rhine, the Maine, the Jaxt, and the Lhan. In the proper archbishopric there are no provincial states, except on the Eichsfeld, and the nobility belong to the immediate knight∣hood of the empire. The predominant religion of the electorate is the Roman catholic, but in several places there are still many protestants. The Jews are tolerated in every part of it except on the Eichsfeld, and in the territory of Erfurt. As the country is under the dominion of an ecclesiastic, the reader need not be told, that almost the whole property thereof belongs to priests, monks, and nuns; and that all places and offices are possessed by the clergy. For the education of youth, be∣sides the Jesuits colleges, there are the universities of Mentz and Erfurt. The archbishopric is not altogether without manufactures, particularly those of woollen and linen cloth, glass-mirrors, and por∣celain, in which, and in wine, almonds, chesnuts, nuts, flax, and tobacco, a considerable trade is carried on. The present elector endeavours, in the most commendable manner, to make commerce flourish both at Mentz and in all the archiepiscopal countries. This prelate is chosen by the chapter, and swears to a capitulation. He is not only the first archbishop, but also elector of Germany, in consequence of his being arch-chancellor of the
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
empire. He is visitor of all the courts of the em∣pire, director of its posts, and guardian of the ar∣chives and matricula. He crowns the emperor, nominates a vice-chancellor of the empire, and holds a chancery at the imperial court; to him al∣so all foreign princes and states direct what propo∣sitions they make to the empire, as well as apply for the redress of grievances. His assessors in the chamber court are possessed of the first place. For the maintenanee of this court, he pays, each term, nine hundred rix-dollars, twenty-one kruitzers. In spirituals he stands immediately under the see of Rome. The bishoprics still subject to his juris∣diction, are those of Worms, Spire, Strasburg, Constance, Augsburg, Chur or Coire, Wurtz∣burg, Eichstadt, Paderborn, Hildesheim, and Fulda. For the government of the country, and the administration of justice, the chief colleges are the privy-conference, the privy-chancery, the aulic-council, and the reversion-judicatory, to the last of which appeals lie from the inferior judicato∣ries. The revenues of the elector are said to amount to about one hundred thousand pounds, arising chiefly from the tolls on the Rhine and Maine, the tax on wine, and that paid by the Jews. He is able to maintain five or six thousand men at all times; but, to save unnecessary expence, seldom keeps above half that number of regular troops; for his income, when he is only archbi∣shop of Mentz, without commendams, which is seldom the case, will allow of no greater state or expences; and his houshold is suited rather to his sacred than his temporal character. In the city of Mentz, the circle of the Upper Rhine fre∣quently keeps a garrison, and in Erfurt both the emperor and elector keeps one. Of the electoral dominions in this circle, the most considerable places are,</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="240"/>
Mentz, which stands on the Rhine, near where the Maine falls into it, and is the capital of the archbishopric and electorate. It is called in Latin Moguntia and Moguntianum, and in French Mayence, and stands fifteen miles west from Frankfort, twenty north from Worms, forty-eight from Heidelberg, forty-five from Spire, one hundred and eighty-six from Strasburg, sixty from Triers, and seventy-four from Cologne. The city is pretty large and populous; but most of the streets are narrow, the houses old fashioned, and the fortifications remain still unfinished. The elector has several palaces in and about the city, with fine gardens. It was made an archbishopric in 729 by Pepin and pope Gregory III. The ca∣thedral, which is a lofty vaulted building, in the year 1755, was ornamented a-new, and furnished with windows. Besides the cathedral, here are many collegiate and other churches, with several monasteries, nunneries, and hospitals, an univer∣sity founded in the years 1477 and in 1482, by the elector Diether, a bridge of boats over the Rhine, manufactures of stockings and stuffs, and two yearly fairs established by the present elector, who endeavours, in the most commendable man∣ner, as we observed above, to make commerce flou∣rish both here and in the rest of his dominions. This city claims the invention of the art of printing, which if not invented, was at least much improved here by John Faust, or, as others say, by John Guttenburg, about the year 1450. The vestments in which the electors say mass are extremely rich, and the ca∣nopy under which the host is carried in procession, is entirely covered with pearl. There is a beau∣tiful key along the river, defended by cannon. In the cathedral are some fine monuments, and a con∣siderable treasure. On its windows and those of
<PB N="26" REF="250"/>
the palace, are painted a wheel, which is a part of the elector's coat of arms. The charter-house here is one of the finest in Europe, both for its buildings and situation, having apartments large and commodious enough to lodge a sovereign and his retinue, and situated on an eminence fronting the Rhine. At the foot of this house, stands the Favorita, a small but elegant electoral palace, with most charming gardens. Mentz has a flourishing trade, especially in Rhenish wines, of which the vineyards in this neighbourhood yield the best, particularly those of Hockam, whence the finest sort of Rhenish wine has got the name of Old Hock.</P>
<P>Cassel, a small town on the Rhine, opposite to Mentz, with which it has a communication by the bridge of boats.</P>
<P>Hockst, a small town on the Mayne, in which is an Antonite cloister, and a porcelain manufac∣tory. Here also is a toll on the Mayne, and in the district to which the town gives name is another small place called Hofsheim.</P>
<P>Kronberg, a small town, standing on a moun∣tain, the inhabitants of which are partly protes∣tants and partly Roman catholics. It once be∣longed to the landgrave of Hesse. The district which it gives name to contains some fine woods, with great numbers of chesnut and other fruit∣trees.</P>
<P>Eltvil, or Elfeld, a small town five miles west from Mentz, which has a strong castle, and is the capital of the Rheingau, a tract lying along the Rhine, and very fruitful, especially in excellent wines. There are several other small towns and cloisters in the Rheingau.</P>
<P>Lohnstein, or Lahnstein, a small town, with a castle, on the Rhine, where the Lahn falls into
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
it. It gives name to a district, and has a mineral spring.</P>
<P>Steinheim, a small town on the Mayne, which gives name to a district, in which is the Biber Mark, a wood belonging in common to eleven villages.</P>
<P>Dieburg, a small town, containing a castle and cloister of Capuchins, and giving name to a di∣strict.</P>
<P>Alzenau, a borough in the district of Freyge∣richt, part of which belongs to the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.</P>
<P>Haussen, a village which gives name to a bai∣liwic or district, containing some rich salt-works and a part of the wood of Spassart.</P>
<P>Aschaffenburg, one of the best towns in the archbishopric, standing at the conflux of the rivu∣let Aschaff and the Mayne. Here is a fine castle, in which the elector frequently resides during the season for hunting in the Spassart, together with a collegiate church, a college of Jesuits, and a Capuchin-cloister. The town gives name to a bailiwic, in which are also Seligenstadt, a town on the Mayne, with a Benedictine cloister, the abbot of which stiles himself lord of Geiselbach, Omersbach, and Hofstaden, together with Obern∣burg, a small town, and Dettingen, a village on the Mayne, noted for the battle fought near it in 1743, between the English and French, in which the latter were obliged to quit the field, and would have been entirely defeated, had not the field-marshal the earl of Stair's opinion been over∣ruled.</P>
<P>Miltenburg, a small town on the Mayne, con∣taining a castle, a Franciscan cloister, and gymna∣sium, and giving name to a district, in which is Prodzelen, a small town on the Mayne.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="270"/>
Amorbach, a small town, containing an abbey of Benedictines, and giving name to a district, in which is also Buchen, Walthurn, and Burken, small towns.</P>

<P>Amoneburg, a small town on the Ohm, which, in Latin, is called Amana, containing a collegiate church dedicated to John the Baptist, and giving name to a district, in which is also the small town of Neustadt.</P>
<P>Fritzlar, a pretty strong town on the river Edos, containing two collegiate churches, with an Ur∣seline nunnery, and giving name to a territory which lies betwixt Lower Hesse and the county of Waldeck, and has another small town in it called Naumburg, or Numburg.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="280"/>
Bingen, a small trading-town on the Rhine, sub∣ject to the chapter of Mentz, and containing a Capuchin-cloister. A toll is levied here for what∣ever passes up or down the Rhine, which is twice as broad at this place, as the Thames at London. Not far from the town is the celebrated Binger∣loch, where the Rhine is confined between two high rocks, which with the water-fall occasioned by the river Nahe's emptying itself there into the Rhine, makes the passage very dangerous. Hard by, in an island or rock in the Rhine, is the fa∣mous Mause-thurm, i. e. the mice or rats tower, so called, as the people here will have it, from the following accident: an archbishop who had a great antipathy to beggars, and used to call them the rats that eat up the corn, was, by the just ven∣geance of heaven, so pestered with rats and mice, that tho' he fled to this tower to avoid them, yet was pursued across the river, and devoured by them. Others reject this story as fabulous; and think the tower was so called, from the Germans giving the name of rats to the officers that were placed in it, to levy the toll, old buildings being generally called rats-nests.</P>
<P>Hocheim, a market-town, noted for the ex∣cellent wine produced in its neighbourhood.</P>

<HEAD>The CITY of ERFURT, and its TERRITORY.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which is reckoned the capital of Thu∣ringia, lying sixteen miles west of Weymar, sixty of Leipzig, sixty-seven north of Bamberg, and seventy south of Halberstadt, was made a bishopric by St. Boniface in the eighth century. Both the city and its territory, which is of a con∣siderable extent, are subject to the elector of
<PB N="30" REF="290"/>
Mentz; but the inhabitants of both, or at least the greatest part of them, are protestants, and entitled, by express stipulations, to the free exercise and en∣joyment of their religion: the civil and criminal court too consists of an equal number of Roman catholic and Lutheran assessors; and the members of the town-council are partly catholics and partly protestants, the last having likewise a con∣sistory of their own persuasion. The city is large and well fortified, but not very populous, and the buildings are mostly old fashioned. The ter∣ritory is pleasant and fruitful both in corn and wine. The garrison consists of two battalions of imperial and electoral troops. There is a bell here called Susanna, which is said to be the biggest in Germany, weighing above twelve tons. Here also are two citadels, with a great many churches; some collegiate, some Roman catholic, and some Lutheran; together with a rich Benedictine mo∣nastery, seven cloysters, of which one is the Scottish, a college of Jesuits, a Lutheran gymnasium, an university of five colleges, the professors of which are partly Lutherans, and partly Roman catho∣lics, the imperial academy of the Naturae Curio∣sorum, a riding academy, a botanic garden, an astronomical observatory, an anatomical theatre, several good libraries, and an academy of the use∣ful sciences. Several diets of the empire have been held here. In 1664, the city was besieged and taken by the elector of Mentz, with the help of the French and Lorrain troops. But by stipula∣tions with the elector and princes of Saxony, who were protectors of the city, its privileges were in a great measure secured to it. The territory be∣longing to the city contains two small towns, and seventy-three villages, among which are five called the kitchen villages, as being obliged to perform
<PB N="31" REF="300"/>
certain services and liveries to the archbishop's kit∣chen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The EICHSFELD.</HEAD>
<P>That part of the electorate, called the Eichs∣feld, is surrounded by Hesse, Thuringia, the prin∣cipalities of Grubenhagen and Calenberg. It ex∣tends about thirty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, and is divided into the upper and lower Eichsfeld, the former mountainous, but healthy and populous: the latter, tho' not enjoying perhaps so pure an air, is more level, warm, and fruitful, abounding in corn, cattle, flax, and tobacco. Great quantities of linen and serge are made in the upper, in which the rivers Leine, Lutter, Un∣strut, Wipper, and Rume have their source. The Thuringian language is spoken in the upper, but in the under the lower Saxon. In both are four ci∣ties, three boroughs, and one hundred and fifty villages. The diets, which consist of the repre∣sentatives of the abbies, nunneries, and certain towns, with the nobility, are held, if the weather will permit, in the open air, at a place near Jage∣banks-Warte, if not, in the council house at Heiligenstadt. There are a few protestants in the Eichsfeld, but the prevailing religion is the Ro∣man catholic. With regard to ecclesiastical mat∣ters, the country is divided into ten provincial deaneries and eighty-one parishes, in which are two collegiate foundations, two abbies, and six nun∣neries. The right of patronage in some places belongs to the archbishop, in others to the clois∣ters and foundations, and in others to the nobility. At Heiligenstadt are held the supreme temporal courts, and there also resides the lieutenant, or ad∣ministrator; but the seat of the archiepiscopal
<PB N="32" REF="310"/>
commissariate, which has the spiritual jurisdiction over the whole Eichsfeld, is at Duderstadt. The places of most note in this upper district are,</P>
<P>Heiligenstadt, the capital of the country, situate on the river Leine, and containing a fine castle, in which the colleges assemble, a collegiate church dedicated to St. Martin, a Jesuits college, three other churches, and a school.</P>
<P>Stadt-Worbes, a small town with a cloister of Franciscans.</P>
<P>Dingelstadt, a large borough on the Unstrut.</P>
<P>Treffurt, a town on the Werra, which gives name to a district.</P>
<P>Reiffenstein, an abbey of Cistercians.</P>
<P>Beuren, and Anroda, nunneries of Cistercians, the first on the Leine, and the second on the Unstrut. Zell, a nunnery of Benedictines.</P>
<P>The only places in the lower district worth men∣tioning are,</P>
<P>Duderstadt, a town on the Hahle, containing an Urseline nunnery, the superior of which is styled Worthy Mother, and is changed every three years. The inhabitants, many of whom are Lu∣therans, subsist chiefly by beer-brewing, and by the culture of tobacco.</P>
<P>Gieboldhausen, and Lindau, boroughs seated on the Rume.</P>
<P>Geroda or Gerroda, a very rich Benedictine abbey.</P>
<P>Teistungenberg, a Cistercian nunnery, near Du∣derstadt.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ARCHBISHOPRIC of TRIERS, or TREVES.</HEAD>
<P>This archbishopric lies between Cologne, Berg, and Juliers on the north, Lorrain, and
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
the Palatinate on the south, Luxemburg on the west, and the Wetterau on the east. Its ex∣tent fom south to north is about eighty miles, but its breadth is very unequal. On the banks of the Rhine and Moselle, the country is populous and fruitful in corn and wine, but elsewhere moun∣tainous and woody, yet abounding in game and acid springs, and in metals and minerals of various kinds. It is watered not only by the Rhine and Moselle, but also by the Saar and Kyll, and con∣tains twenty-eight towns. The states consist of the prelates or abbots, with the representatives of the clergy, and of certain towns. The inhabitants are all papists except in such places as the elector possesses in common with other princes, where there are some protestants. Under the archbishop are five archdeacons, and, subordinate to these, twenty provincial deans. The antient Treveri from whom the city of Triers and the electorate take their name, were a very warlike people: their general, Ambiorix, cut off a whole Roman army. They worshipped Mars and Apollo, 'till Constan∣tine established Christianity among them: but at what time the bishopric and archbishopric were erected is uncertain. The church of Treves, however, is commonly accounted the most antient of Germany. The chapter which elects the arch∣bishop from among themselves and makes him swear to a capitulation, consists of sixteen capitu∣lary canons, who are all of noble extraction, be∣sides twenty-four others, who are domiceled. At every new election, the pope receives large sums for confirmation, the pallium, and for annats. The archiepiscopal title is, By the grace of God, archbishop of Treves, of the holy Roman empire throughout Gaul and the kingdom of Arles, arch-chancellor and elector, and also administra∣tor of Prum. He is the second elector in rank,
<PB N="34" REF="330"/>
and at the election of an emperor has the first voice. His matricular assessment is twenty six horse and two-thirds, and one hundred and twenty-two foot two-thirds, or eight hundred and six florins, forty kruitzers. In the diets of the circle he has the second place, and nominates one assessor of the chamber judicatory, towards the maintenance of which he contributes, each term, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars fifty-eight kruitzers. The tolls on the Moselle and Rhine, his demesnes, and his office of noble guardian of the Minors, with the taxes he lays on his subjects, are supposed to bring him in about seventy thousand per annum. For the government of this electorate and the ad∣ministration of justice, besides the regency and revision court, there are the two aulic judicatories, to which appeals lie from the inferior courts. There are also two spiritual high courts. The hereditary officers are the marshal, the chamberlain, the fewer, and cupbearer. Among other prerogatives, this elector has power to banish excommunicated persons out of the empire, if they do not reconcile themselves to the church within a year, and to take possession of the estates of minors, till they are of age. He has also a right to reunite all the fiefs of his diocese, upon failure of heirs, to the domains of his church. His subjects may appeal to the cham∣ber of the empire in all causes above a thousand florins. The regular troops he maintains, besides a militia, amount to between eleven and twelve hundred, besides a life-guard of forty men. The archbishopric is divided into the upper and lower, in the former of which the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Triers, in French Treves, in Latin Trevere, Trevers, Treviris, or Augusta Trevirorum, the capital of the archbishopric, standing sixty miles west of Mentz, fifty-two south of Cologne, and eighty two north of Strasburg. This city vies
<PB N="35" REF="340"/>
with most in Europe for antiquity, having been a large and noted town before Augustus settled a colony in it. It was free and imperial 'till the year 1560, when it was surprized and subjected by its archbishop, James III. It stands on the Moselle, over which it has a fair stone bridge. The cathe∣dral is a large building, and near it stands the elector's palace, which not long ago was rebuilt. Here are three collegiate and five parish churches, three colleges of Jesuits, thirteen monasteries and nunneries, an university founded in 1472, a house of the Teutonic order, and another of that of Malta, with some remains of the antient Roman theatre. Roman coins and medals are often found in the ruins of the old city. In the cathedral they pretend to have our Saviour's coat, and St. Peter's staff, to which they ascribe miracles. The private houses here are mean, and the city is neither well fortified, nor inhabited.</P>
<P>Psalzel, in Latin Palatiolum, a small town on the Moselle near Triers, where, in the time of the Romans, stood a palatium. The town gives name to a district, in which is Conz, a borough on the Saar, over which there is a bridge here called Consarbruck.</P>
<P>St. Maximin, one of the oldest and richest ab∣beys in Germany. The abbot is the first among the provincial states here, as well as in the duchy of Luxemburg, and arch-chaplain to the reigning Roman empress. In spirituals he stands imme∣diately under the pope. The yearly revenues of the abbey are estimated at six thousand ducats. Be∣sides the bailiwic of St. Maximin, with the juris∣diction and regalia therein, to the abbey belong also the seigniory and burgraviate of Freudenberg on the Saar, and other estates, with the superiority, jurisdiction, and right of taxation in them.</P>

<P>Zell in Hamm, a small town on the Moselle, but the capital of a bailiwic, in which is Engelport, in Latin Porta Angelica, a nunnery of the order of the Praemonstratenses.</P>
<P>In the lower archbishopric the chief places are,</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="360"/>
Coblenz, in Latin Confluentia, the capital, seated near the conflux of the Moselle and Rhine, thirty-five miles north-west from Mentz, forty south-east from Cologne, and fifty-two north-east from Triers. It is strongly fortified and well built, and has a bridge of boats over the Rhine, and another of stone of fourteen arches over the Moselle. Here also are several collegiate and other churches, besides monasteries and nunneries, a Jesuits college, agym∣nasium, an archiepiscopal seminary, and a castle. The Romans had a fort at this town, and the first kings of the Franks frequently resided in it. It lies in the bailiwic that takes its name from Ehren∣breitstein, a strong fortress opposite to Coblenz, with a well in it two hundred and eighty feet deep, and an electoral palace, just below it.</P>
<P>Arnstein, a celebrated Praemonstratensian abbey on the Lahn.</P>
<P>Conostein-Engers, a small town on the Rhine in the bailiwic of Bergpflege, in which are also an arch∣iepiscopal palace at Karlich, the noble Praemonstra∣tensian nunnery of Marienrode, and the Cistercian nunnery of Warsheim.</P>

<HEAD>The ARCHBISHOPRIC of COLOGNE.</HEAD>
<P>The territories belonging to it lie not all contigu∣ous, but intermixed with the dominions of other states. The principal part of them stretches along the Rhine for near one hundred miles, but the breadth
<PB N="39" REF="380"/>
thereof is hardly any where above seven or eight. Besides this tract, there is the county of Recklink∣hausen, with the duchy of Westphalia, and a di∣strict betwixt the duchy of Juliers and the arch∣bishopric of Triers. That part of the archbishop∣ric which is situated on the Rhine is more fruit∣ful than the others, abounding in corn and wine. The river, besides contributing to its fertility, is of very great benefit to it in other respects. The states of the electorate consist of the prelates, nobi∣lity, and towns; and the diets for the proper arch∣bishopric are held at Bonn. The elector of Co∣logne is more powerful than either of the other two ecclesiastical electors. His dominions con∣tain fifty-two towns, and about seventeen boroughs. He has the second suffrage in the electoral college, and crowns the emperor, when the ceremony is performed in his own diocese, or those of his suf∣fragans. His see was raised from a bishopric to an archbishopric in the eighth century. His suffra∣gans at present are the bishops of Liege, Munster, and Osnabrug, and formerly also those of Utrecht and Minden; but he has no authority in spirituals over the protestants of the bishopric of Osnabrug, even when he is himself bishop thereof. His title is, By the grace of God archbishop of Cologne, and arch-chancellor of the holy Roman empire through∣out Italy, as also elector and legatus-natus of the holy apostolic see, duke of Engern and Westpha∣lia, &amp;c. The right of electing the emperor, ex∣clusive of the other princes, devolved on him and the other arch-officers of the empire, about the end of the thirteenth century. The great chapter of Cologn is one of the noblest in Europe, con∣sisting of forty canons, who are generally princes or counts of the empire. Of these twenty-five chuse the archbishop, and may advance one of their
<PB N="40" REF="390"/>
own body to that high dignity, if they are so in∣clined. The revenues arising from the archbishop∣ric amount to about one hundred and thirty thou∣sand pounds sterling; but the elector is generally possessed of several other great benefices. He has his hereditary officers and his life-guards, consist∣ing of halbardiers and yeomen, besides a regiment of foot-guards, which make a handsome appearance. His matricular quota is sixty horse and two hun∣dred and seventy-seven foot, or one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight florins monthly in lieu of them, and to the chamber-court he contributes, each term, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars, fifty-eight kruitzers. The archbishopric, properly so called, is divided into the Upper and Lower, in the former of which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Bonn, on the Rhine, where the elector resides in a fine palace, but not quite finished. This town lies fifteen miles south of Cologne, in a fruitful country, and which produces, in particular, good wine. It is not large, but well built and fortified. The collegiate church is said to have been founded by St. Helena. The town has been frequently besieged, taken, and retaken. It contains a col∣lege of Jesuits and several cloisters, and in time of war is generally garrisoned by the troops of the empire. A toll is levied here on the Rhine. In the bailiwic, to which the town gives name, are several electoral pleasure-houses, and a small town called Heymertsen, on the Erfft.</P>

Andernach, in Latin Antoniacum, Antunacum, and Antonacense Castellum, a town on the Rhine, which was formerly a free and imperial city. Dru∣sus is said to have built a fort at this place, to awe the Germans, and it is believed that his son Cali∣gula was born in it. There are several monasteries in the town, and in its neighbourhood mineral wa∣ters, much frequented. A toll also is levied here on the Rhine. In the bailiwic to which the town gives name is an abbey called St. Thomas, and Rens, or Rees, a small town on the Rhine, near which is a remarkable piece of antiquity, called the Konigstuhl, in Latin Thronus Regalis. It is a large round vault of free-stone, resting on nine pillars, and furnished with seven seats for the elec∣tors, who used formerly to consult here about the election of an emperor, and other weighty matters, and some emperors have actually been elected here. The ascent to it is by twenty-eight steps. This place was pitched upon for the assemblies of the electors, because it lay near the territories of seve∣ral of them.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of WESTPHALIA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the east by the bishop∣ric of Paderborn, and the territories of Waldeck and Hesse; to the south by the counties of Witgenstein and Nassau, and the duchy of Berg; to the north by the bishopric of Munster and the county of Lippe. It is about forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The lower part of it is very fruitful, yielding plen∣ty of corn and cattle, and some salt-springs. The higher affords iron-ore, calamy, lead, copper, some silver and gold, fine woods, cattle, game, fish,
<PB N="44" REF="430"/>
with a little corn. The rivers, that either pass thro' the duchy, or along its borders, are the Rahr, the Lenne, the Bigge, the Dimel, and the Lippe. There are twenty eight towns in it, besides bo∣roughs and cloisters. The provincial diets are held at Arensberg. In the year 1180, the empe∣ror Frederic I. made a donation of this duchy to the archbishopric of Cologne, which was confirm∣ed by succeeding emperors; and in 1368, the last duke of Arensberg ceded to it also the county of Arensberg. The duchy is governed at present by a bailiff, under the archbishop, and is divided into the Hellwege, the Haarstrank, and the Surland; or otherwise into the Ruden, the Werl, the Bil∣stein, and the Brilon quarters.</P>
<P>In the Rhuden quarter, besides the town which gives name to it, situated on the river Mon, and containing a capuchin monastery and nunnery, are,</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PALATINATE of the RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>This Palatinate is divided into two parts by the Rhine, called the Upper and Lower Palatinate. The former lies in the circle of Bavaria, and belongs to the elector thereof; but the latter, in the circle we are now treating of, belongs to the elector Palatine. The latter part is bounded to the east by the county of Katzenellnbogen, the archbishop∣ric of Mentz, the bishopric of Worms, and part of the territory of the Tuetonic order in Franconia; to the west by Alsace, the duchy of Deuxponts, the county of Sponheim, the duchy of Simmern, and certain districts of the electorate of Mentz; to the south by the duchy of Wurtemberg, and the bishorpric of Spire; and to the north by a part of the archbishopric of Mentz, and the county of Katzenellnbogen. It contains forty-one towns, besides several boroughs; and its greatest extent is about eighty miles. The air is healthful, and the soil fruitful in corn, pasturage, wine, tobacco, and all sorts of pulse, and fruits, particularly walnuts, chesnuts, and almonds. This country also breeds abundance of cattle, and is well watered by the Neckar, the Nahe, and the Rhine. In the last of these, near Germersheim and Selz, is found gold, the exclusive right of searching for which is farm∣ed out by the elector. The state of religion hath varied greatly here since the reformation, Luther∣anism and Calvinism having been uppermost by
<PB N="46" REF="450"/>
turns, till the electorate devolved to the popish branches of the family, when popery, with all its superstition and mummery, was established anew: so that the protestant religion is now on a very pre∣carious footing in the Palatinate, tho' most of the natives are still of that persuasion: but the two sects of protestants, namely, the Lutherans and Calvinists, have greatly contributed to their own ruin, by their mutual jealousy and animosity, being no less ran∣corous against one another, than against their com∣mon adversaries the papists. The Lutherans reckon themselves fifty thousand strong, and are possessed of about eighty-five churches; but not one half of their preachers and school-masters have a compe∣tent maintenance. The number of Calvinist clergy here is estimated at five hundred, and that of the Roman catholics at four hundred. Besides schools and Jesuits colleges in this country, there is one university, namely, that of Heidelberg; but there is very little trade in it except in wine. Authors are divided about the origin of the name Palatines, or Pfalzgraves, as the Germans call them; but it seems most likely to be derived from the palatia, or palaces, which the old Frankish and German kings and Roman emperors were possessed of in different parts of the country, and over which they appointed supreme stewards or judges, who were called Pala∣tines or Pfalzgraves. The countries where these Palatines kept their courts were, from them, called Palatinates, which name came at last to be appropriated, by way of eminence, to this coun∣try, as being the most considerable of them. The antient electoral line failing in 1685, the electorate devolved to Philip-William, duke of Neuburg; and upon the death of his second son, Charles-Philip, to the prince of Sulzbach. This elector has the title of arch-treasurer of the empire, as well as the elector of Brunswic-Luneburg, and is the fifth
<PB N="47" REF="460"/>
in rank among the secular electors. He is also one of the vicars of the empire, alternately with the elector of Bavaria, and enjoys many other preroga∣tives, for which we refer the reader to our general account of Germany. In his own dominions he dis∣poses of all vacant benefices, but allows the eccle∣siastical council, composed of two clergymen and two laymen, to present two candidates, of which he chuses one. He is also master of all the tythes in his dominions; but he either grants them to the clergy, or salaries in lieu of them, out of the re∣venues of the church. His title is pfalzgrave of the Rhine; archtreasurer and elector of the holy Roman empire; duke in Bavaria, Juliers, Cleve, and Berg; prince of Mors; marquis of Bergen∣op-Zoom; count of Veldens, Sponheim, the Mark, and Ravensberg, and lord of Ravenstein. His quota to the army of the empire is thirty horse, and one hundred and thirty-eight foot, or nine hun∣dred and fourteen florins, monthly. To the cham∣ber of Wetzlar he contributes, each term, four hundred and four rix-dollars, eighty-two kruit∣zers. There is an order of knighthood in this country, viz. that of St. Hubert; the badge of which is a quadrangular cross pendant to a red ribbon, with a star on the breast. The whole of the elector's revenue, arising from the Palatinate, the duchies of Berg and Juliers, the seigniory of Ravenstein, and the duchies of Neuburg and Sultzbach, hath been estimated at about three hun∣dred thousand pounds per annum. The military establishment consists of several regiments of horse and foot, besides the horse and Swiss life-guards. All the different courts and councils, usual in other countries for the different departments of govern∣ment, are also to be found here. As to towns and other places in this Palatinate, the most considera∣ble are,</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="470"/>
Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatinate, ten miles from Manheim, twelve from Spire, thirty∣eight from Frankfort, and thirty-five from Mentz. This city is situated near the river Neckar, in a good air, and encompassed on all sides, except to the west, with hills covered with vines. According to some, it takes its name from Heidel, signifying a myrtle, and berg a mountain; there being, or hav∣ing been, plenty of those trees on the mountains in the neighbourhood. It is an antient city, and has been frequently besieged and taken, plundered and destroyed; but the barbarity of the French here in 1689, and 1693, was such, that no person, whose heart is not quite callous and insensible, can think of them, much less describe them, without shud∣dering. How great is the effrontery of these peo∣ple to value themselves upon their politeness and humanity, and to charge other nations, in parti∣cular the English, a nation distinguished for its generosity and sensibility, with cruelty and ferocity. With respect to their behaviour here, our proposed brevity will not allow us to be particular. Let it suffice to say, that it would have degraced those whom they contemptuously call Les sauvages d'Amerique, tho' they have a much juster title to the appellation themselves. What will the reader, who knows their barbarities in these and other countries, think of one of their writers, who had lately the unparalleled assurance to call the Eng∣lish, Les sauvages d'Europe, the savages of Eu∣rope? As to Heidelberg, it is at present a small, but well built city. The electorel palace is an old fashioned building, but standing on a hill, com∣mands a fine prospect. As to the famous library here, many valuable books and manuscripts were taken from it in 1622, when general Tilly made himself master of the town, and sent to Rome, Vienna, and
<PB N="49" REF="480"/>
Munich. The professors of the antiently so celebrated university here, at present, are partly Calvinists, and partly Roman catholics. The Calvinists have also a gymnasium. Of the churches, some belong to the Calvinists, some to the Lutherans, and some to the Roman catholics, the last of whom have also six cloisters in the town, with a college of Jesuits. In the college called the Sapience, which belongs at present to the Calvinists, twelve poor students are provided with lodgings and board. Opposite to Heidelberg is a high mountain, on which the Romans had a castle, and which, by some, is thought to be the Mons Pyrus, men∣tioned by Aminianus Marcellinus. It is now called the Holy Mountain, from a cloister erected on it in 1023, to which frequent pilgrimages are made. The famous tun here, which stood in a cellar, under one of the towers of the electoral pa∣lace, and contained six hundred hogsheads, was emptied, and knocked in pieces, by the French in 1688; but the elector Charles-Lewis caused a new one to be made, which is larger.</P>
<P>Manheim, the residence of the elector, stands on the east side of the Rhine, a quarter of a league from its conflux with the Neckar, and eight miles west of Heidelberg. This is now one of the finest towns of Germany, and strongly for∣tified; but no less than ten thousand men would be required for its defence: besides, it labours un∣der a want of good water and wholesome air. The electoral palace is one of the most magnificent in Europe, and contains a grand collection of paintings, brought hither from Dusseldorp, besides antiquities and curiosities, among which is the crown of the un∣happy Frederic V. king of Bohemia. The three religions tolerated in the empire have churches in this city. Here is also a Jewish synagogue, and a college of Jesuits, with a Capuchin and Carmelite
<PB N="50" REF="490"/>
cloister. Some manufactures likewise, and a con∣siderable trade, are carried on in this town, the latter chiefly by the Jews, some of whom are very rich.</P>
<P>Wreblingen, or Weiblingen, a small town on the Neckar, not far from Heidelberg.</P>
<P>Weinheim, a town situated in the finest part of the Bergstrasz. The neighbourhood produces good wine, and contains a castle on a mountain.</P>
<P>Schonau, Neckar-Gemund, Wiszloch, Dils∣perg, all small towns, situated in the bailiwic of Heidelberg.</P>
<P>Ladenberg, an antient little town on the Neckar, sixteen miles from Heidelberg, of which one half formerly belonged to the elector, and the other to the bishop of Worms; but now the whole is the elector's. In the time of the Romans it was named Lupodunum. Here are churches of the three re∣ligions.</P>
<P>Mosbach, a small town, containing a castle, with churches belonging to the three religions, and a manufacture of cloth. It gives name to a bailiwic, in which are also Halspach, Obreckheim, Eber∣bach, and Sinzheim, the last of which is a large place, with a Franciscan cloister.</P>
<P>Boxberg, a small town, which gives name to a bailiwic belonging to the bishop of Wurtzburg.</P>
<P>Bretten, a small town, noted for being the birth place of Philip Melancthon. The three re∣ligions have churches in this town, which gives name to a bailiwic, containing three other small towns, viz. Heidelsheim, Weingarten, and Ep∣pingen.</P>
<P>Germersheim, a town, with a castle, situated on the Rhine, where it is joined by the Queich, and where is a profitable fishery, and a gold wash. The emperor Rodolph I. of Hapsburg, died in this town, which is supposed to be the Vicus Ju∣lianus of the Romans, and gives name to a baili∣wic,
<PB N="51" REF="500"/>
containing also a commandery of the order of St. John, together with Hagenbach, Selz, and Billinkeim, small towns on the Rhine. At Selz is a gold wash, and at the same place was antiently a noble provostship, the revenues of which are now enjoyed by the Roman catholics.</P>
<P>Neustadt on the Hart, a town, having a college or gymnasium, and giving name to a bailiwic, which yields an excellent wine, and contains Wach∣enheim, Oggersheim, and Lambsheim, small towns. Near Neustadt is a castle.</P>
<P>Lautern, a town on the rivulet Lauter, in which the three religions have churches, and which gives name to a bailiwic, containing also Otterberg, Rockenhausen, and Wolfstein, small towns.</P>
<P>Alzey, a small town on the river Selz, con∣taining a castle, with a church for each of the three religions, and giving name to a baliwic, in which are also Odernheim and Pfeddersheim, small towns. In the neighbourhood of Alzey is a stone monu∣ment, erected in memory of a dangerous leap, which the elector Frederic IV. made over a very broad ditch, on horseback.</P>
<P>Frankenthal, a considerable town, formerly for∣tified, but afterwards miserably laid waste, and dismantled by the French. In 1750, great pri∣vileges were promised to all protestants and Ro∣man catholics who should come and settle in it.</P>
<P>Oppenheim, which stands on a hill near the Rhine, and was once an imperial free city. In 1688, and 1689, it was miserably laid waste by the French, as were all the other towns of the Pa∣latinate; but it has since recovered itself. All the three religions have churches here.</P>
<P>Ingelheim, a borough on the Selz, in which Sebastian Munster, the geographer, and, as some think, Charlemagne, the emperor, were born.</P>
<P>Stromberg, a small place, containing a castle,
<PB N="52" REF="510"/>
and giving name to a bailiwic, in which are found iron, lead, silver, chrystal, and black marble.</P>
<P>Bacharach, a town on the Rhine, the name of which, as some imagine, is a corruption of Bacchi Ara, i. e. the altar of Bacchus; there being a stone opposite to it in the Rhine shaped like an altar, and called by the inhabitants the altar-stone, upon which, it is thought, victims were formerly offer∣ed to Bacchus, the neighbouring country yielding Muscadel wine. The inhabitants here, as in all the other towns of the Palatinate, are a medley of Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. The town contains a cloister, and on a mountain near it stands the castle of Staleck, in which the Pfalzgraves formerly some time resided.</P>
<P>Caub, a small town on the Rhine, where a toll is collected. Hard by it is a castle, called Gu∣tenfels.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of AREMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which is but small, is sur∣rounded by the archbishopric of Cologn, the duchy of Juliers, and the county of Blankenheim. The dukes of Aremberg and Arschot are a branch of the house of Ligne. Till 1576 they were only counts, but were then made princes of the empire, and, in 1644, dukes. They have seat and voice both at the diets of the empire and circle, in the college of princes; and their assessment in the matricula is two horse, and six foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the cham∣ber-court, each term, their quota is eighty rix-dollars and sixty kruitzers. They take their title from Aremberg, which, tho' a small town, has a castle, and is the capital of the principality.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="520"/>
The princes of Thurn, or Tour, and Taxis, tho' they have no immediate estate in this circle, yet have seat and voice in its diets, as also in those of the empire. The first they obtained in conse∣quence of advancing to the circle, in the year 1724, by way of purchase, eighty thousand rix-dollars; and the other in consequence of an imperial de∣cree, founded upon their having had the office of postmaster of the empire erected in their favour into a free mesne estate. They took their seat a∣mong the princes in the diet of the empire, for the first time, in 1754.</P>

<HEAD>The TEUTONIC BAILIWIC of COBLENZ.</HEAD>
<P>The Teutonic order of knights are possessed of a bailiwic, in this circle, named from the town of Coblenz, which entitles them to a seat and voice among the prelates of the empire, and also in the diets of the circle. Its matricular assess∣ment is four horse, and twenty foot, or one hun∣dred and twenty-eight florins, monthly; and to the chamber-court, fifty rix-dollars, sixty-seven kruitzers. To this bailiwic, which has its seat at Cologn, belong seven commanderies, or com∣mendams.</P>

<HEAD>The BURGRAVIATE of REINECK.</HEAD>
<P>This little burgraviate lies on the Rhine, be∣tween the duchy of Juliers, and the archbishopric of Cologn. It had formerly burgraves of its own; but now belongs to the counts of Sinzendorf, of the Ernest - Brunn line, who, on account of it, have seat and voice in the diets of this circle. Its matricular assessment is only one horse, or twelve florins, in lieu of him.</P>
<P>Reineck, from which it takes its name, is a small town on the Rhine.</P>
<P>The elector Palatine was possessed of a part of the town of Glenhausen, in the Witterau, till the year 1746, when he disposed of his share in it to the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, for the sum of twelve thousand florins, to whom the town is now entirely subject; tho', in 1734, it was declared a free imperial city, by a sentence of the chamber judicatory.</P>

<P>THIS circle, antiently much larger than it is at present, a great part of it having been dismembered by France, is now bounded by the Lower Rhine, by which it is almost intersect∣ed, and by those of Westphalia, Lower-Saxony, Upper-Saxony, Franconia, and Swabia, together with Alsace and Lorrain, in the last of which are some lands belonging to it. The states of it are the following: the bishoprics of Worms and Spire; the provostship of Weissenburg; the bishoprics of Strasburg, Basil, and Fulda; the commandery of the order of St. John; the princely abbey of Prum; the provostship of Odenheim; the electoral pala∣tinate of Simmern, Lautern, and Veldenz; the palatinate of Deuxponts, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hersfeld, and Spanheim; the mar∣gravates of Nomeny, Salm with Kirburg, Nassau-Weilburg, Nassau-Usingen, Nassau-Idstein, Nas∣sau-Saarbrucken, and Otweiler, Waldeck, Hanau-Munzenburg, Hanau-Lichtenburg, Solms-Ho∣hensolms, Solms - Braunfels, Solms - Rodolheim, Solms-Laubach, and the electorate of Mentz, on account of Konigstein, Stolberg, on account of Konigstein, Isenburg-Birstein, Isenburg-Budingen, Wachterssbach, and Meerholz; the rhinegraves of Greweiler, Grumbach, Dhaun, Leiningen-Hartenburg, Leiningen-Westerburg, Grunstadt, Munsfelden, Witgenstein of Witgenstein, Wit∣genstein-Berleburg, Falkenstein, Reipolzkirchen, Chriechingen, Wartenberg, Bretzenheim, Dach∣stuhl, and Ollbruck; with the imperial cities of Worms, Spire, Frankfort, Friedberg, and Wetz∣lar, of all which we shall treat in order. The bishop
<PB N="56" REF="550"/>
of Worms, and the elector Palatine, as prince of Simmern, are joint directors and summoning princes of the circle, the latest diets whereof have been held at Frankfort, but the archives are kept at Worms. With respect to religion, this circle is reckoned among the mixed. To the chamber of Wetzlar it presents two assessors.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric being about twelve miles long, and eight where broadest, lies on both sides the Rhine; and, except where it terminates on the county of Katzenellnbogen, and the territory of Mentz, is environed by the Lower-Palatinate. Some parts of it are level, and fruitful in corn and wine; but, in general, it is barren, mountainous, and woody. There are some protestants in this bishopric, but they live in an oppressed state; and indeed as the papists look upon protestants as here∣tics, and think themselves bound to persecute them, in order to enlighten their minds, and save their souls, they have nothing but insult and in∣justice to expect from them. The regency here appoints the protestant pastors and schoolmasters, but has no other authority in their ecclesiastical or matrimonial matters. In antient times the Vangi∣ones inhabited this district, and the bishop was stiled in Latin, Episcopus Vangionum. A bishop of this see, named Victor, is said to have assisted at the council of Cologn, in the year 347. The bishop∣ric was much more considerable before the Refor∣mation, than it is now. The revenue of it at pre∣sent is said not to exceed two thousand five hundred pounds. The chapter, who chuse the bishop, consists of thirteen capitular canons, and nine that are domiciled. In spirituals the bishop is subject to the archbishop of Mentz. His matricular
<PB N="57" REF="560"/>
assessment is two horse and thirteen foot, or seventy florins monthly, in lieu of them; and to the cham∣ber-court he pays, each term, fifty rix-dollars, sixty∣four kruitzers. The cathedral of this bishopric stands in the imperial city of Worms, where the chapter also resides, and of which we shall give an account afterwards. The only places besides in the bishopric, worth mentioning, are,</P>
<P>Stein, a fortress on the river Weschnitz, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Neuhausen, Rhein, Turkheim, Hockheim, Dirmstein, boroughs, the protestant churches in which the catholics use as freely as their own.</P>
<P>Leiningen, a town on a mountain, whose citadel was destroyed by the French.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of SPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric lies on both sides the Rhine, and is bounded every where by the territories of the elector-palatine, and those of the margrave of Baa∣den-Durlach. Some parts of it are woody and mountainous, but others open, level, and fruitful in corn, wine, almonds, chesnuts, &amp;c. It extends about thirty-two miles in length, and twelve in breadth, and is said to have been antiently the seat of the Nemetes. The bishopric seems to have been erected very early, but by whom is uncertain. The bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Mentz, and, as a prince of the empire, has seat and voice in the diets thereof, and of the circle. His ma∣tricular assessment is eighteen horse and sixty foot, or four hundred and fifty-six florins, monthly, in lieu of them; and to the chamber-court he pays one hundred and sixty rix-dollars, eight kruitzers, on account of the bishopric, and the provostship of Weissenburg. The cathedral is in the imperial city of Spire, where the chapter, consisting of
<PB N="58" REF="570"/>
fourteen capitulars, and thirteen domicelli, also resides. The principal places belonging to the bi∣shopric are,</P>
<P>Philipsburg, a town and fort on the east side of the Rhine. Though it belongs to the bishop of Spire, yet it is looked upon as a fort of the empire, by which the governor and commandant are ap∣pointed. It has stood seven memorable sieges in the space of one hundred years. In 1734 it was taken by the French after a long and bloody siege, in which the famous duke of Berwick, na∣tural son of king James II. of England, was killed by a cannon ball betwixt his two grandsons, as he went to take a view of the trenches. The works are said to be at present in a very decayed state.</P>
<P>Bruchsal, a small town on the river Salza, nine miles south-east of Philipsburg, with a castle, which is the ordinary residence of the bishop. It contains also a commandery of the order of St. John, and a secular college or foundation for im∣mediate nobles of the empire, called the priory of Odenheim, because originally founded there. The college has a particular district belonging to it, part of which is independent of the bishop, who is patron of the college, and generally prior. In quality of the latter, he has a seat and vote in the diet of the empire and circle among the prelates.</P>
<P>Rotenburg, Weibstatt, and Eeidesheim, small towns, the first of which has a castle, and the last stands on the Hart, the banks of which yield good wine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVOSTSHIP of WEISSEN∣BURG.</HEAD>
<P>This princely provostship, which was originally a Benedictine abbey, situate in the antient imperial city of Weissenburg, in the Lower Alsace, in
<PB N="59" REF="580"/>
1546, was converted into a temporal provostship, and annexed to the bishopric of Spire. On ac∣count of it, the bishop has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, and pays a matricu∣lar assessment.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of STRASBURG.</HEAD>
<P>Both the cathedral and chapter of this bishop∣ric are in the city of Strasburg; but the bishop commonly resides in the town of Zabern, or Elsas-Zabern. In respect of that part of his diocese ly∣ing in Alsace, the bishop is subject to France; but in respect of his bailiwics on the other side the Rhine, he is still a prince and state of the Ger∣man empire, and as such, has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, paying a matricular and other assessments. In spirituals he is subject to the archbishop of Mentz. His baili∣wics lying on the German side of the Rhine in Swabia, contain no place of any note. We shall take notice of those in Alsace when we come to treat of that country.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of BASIL.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric, which is pretty large, lies partly in this circle and partly in Switzerland, and is bounded by the Sundgau, the county of Mompel∣gard, the county of Burgundy, the principality of Neufchatel, and the cantons of Bern, Solothurn, and Basil. The inhabitants are partly protestants and partly Roman catholics, and their language partly French and partly Patois, the latter of which is a mixture of French and Italian. The states consist of the clergy and nobility, with the towns and bailiwics. The bishop, whose cathedral stands in the city of Basil, is a prince of the empire,
<PB N="60" REF="590"/>
having as such a seat and vote in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, and paying the usual assessments. He is also closely united, in a defen∣sive alliance, with the catholic cantons of Switzer∣land. His chapter consists of eighteen capitulars and domicelli, and his metropolitan is the arch∣bishop of Besançon. In that part of his domi∣nions which belong to this circle, the chief places are,</P>
<P>Bellelay, an abbey of Premonstratenses, whose abbot is mitred, and president of the provincial states.</P>
<P>Seehof, in French Elays, a small place belong∣ing to the provostship of Munster in Granfelden, which, with its subjects, is allied to and under the protection of the canton of Bern.</P>
<P>St. Ursitz, a town on the Doux, in which is a provostship.</P>
<P>Delsperg, in French Delmont, a town on the river Birsa.</P>
<P>Bruntrut, or Pruntrut, in French Porentru, a town on the river Hallen, in which is the bi∣shop's palace, with a college of Jesuits and a Ca∣puchin cloister.</P>
<P>Lauffen, a little town on the Birsa.</P>
<P>Arlesheim, a borough on the river Birsa, where the chapter has its residence.</P>
<P>Schlingen, a market-town on the Rhine, in the Brisgau, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Of the rest of the bishopric we shall give some account when we come to Switzerland, with which it is united, though it owns the bishop for its su∣perior.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of FULDA.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is surrounded by Hesse, the coun∣ties of Isenburg and Hanau, the bishopric of
<PB N="61" REF="600"/>
Wurzburg, the county of Henneberg, and some districts of the knights of the empire; being in its greatest length above fifty miles, and in breadth above forty. Though it is, in general, a moun∣tainous woody country, yet it is not without rich corn fields, and has also several salt-springs. The principal rivers, by which it is watered, are the Ful∣da and the Saal. Of the inhabitants some are Lu∣therans, but most of them Roman catholics. Pope Zachary I. in 751, made the abbot of Fulda in∣dependent of all episcopal jurisdiction, and subject to the see of Rome alone. Pope John XIII. made them primates of all the abbots in Germany, and the emperor Otho I. arch-chancellors to the Roman empress, upon whose head they put on and take off the crown, at the coronation, and on all other solemn occasions. Pope Benedict XIV. raised the abbey to an exempted bishopric; but the bishop, as abbot, was still to be subject to the rules of his order. He is a prince of the empire, and, as such, has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire, and of the circle of the Upper Rhine. His matricular assessment is two hundred and fifty florins monthly, and two hundred and forty rix-dollars, four kruit∣zers, each term, to the chamber-court. He is elected by the high-chapter, consisting of fifteen persons, who, it is said, must be gentlemen by six∣teen descents. At his installation he pays four hundred florins, or forty pounds, to the pope. His revenue is computed at between twenty and thirty thousand pounds sterling, and, it is said, he can raise between four and five thousand men. In the territory belonging to the abbey, which is di∣vided into bailiwics, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Fulda, the capital, situate on a river of the same name, forty-five miles north-east from Hanau, and fifty from Cassel and Frankfort. It owes its ori∣gin to the abbey, which was founded about the
<PB N="62" REF="610"/>
middle of the eighth century by St. Boniface, and Sturm, its first abbot, for Benedictine monks. It is one of the most considerable in Europe, having been endowed with great privileges by several em∣perors. Here is a church dedicated to our Saviour, and another to St. Boniface, which is collegiate, with a palace for the prince, bishop, and abbot, a college of Jesuits, a nunnery of Benedictines, a gymnasium, and a popish seminary. In the year 1734, a university was founded here by the abbot. The abbey is said to be a stately pile, but the town itself to be ill-built and dirty.</P>
<P>Brumzell, a very old town on the river Fulda.</P>
<P>Burghaun, a little town with a citadel, on the river Haun.</P>
<P>Geyss, a little town on the river Ulster.</P>
<P>Dermbach, or Thermbach, a borough with a castle and cloister of Franciscans. It is the capital of the bailiwic of Fischberg, of which the duke of Saxe-Weimar took possession in 1741.</P>
<P>Hunefeld, a town in the bailiwic of Macken∣zell.</P>
<P>Nouhoff, a borough on the Fulda, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Bruckenau, a walled town, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Hamelburg, on the river Sala, containing a convent of Franciscans, and giving name to a bai∣liwic.</P>
<P>Salmunster, a small town on the river Kins, containing a Franciscan cloister, and giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Herbstein, a small town giving name to a bai∣liwic.</P>
<P>The bailiwics of Salzungen and Lichtenberg were alienated in the year 1366 by the then abbot, and are at present possessed by the dukes of Saxe-Meinungen
<PB N="63" REF="620"/>
and Eisenach, tho' the abbey is very desirous of redeeming them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The MASTERSHIP of ST. JOHN, or the PRINCIPALITY of HEITERSHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>This mastership or principality consists only of the town of Heitersheim, and a few villages in the Brisgau, belonging to the order of St. John. The grand-master of the order is a prince of the empire, and as such has a seat and vote among the princes in the diets of the empire and circle. He pretends, as head or representative of the order, to be sove∣reign of the above places; but the house of Aus∣tria accounts him a vassal. Heitersheim, which gives name to this petty principality, and was pur∣chased by the order in the year 1297, is a market∣town, and the residence of the grand-master. To the grand-master belong also certain tythes and other revenues in the vale of Kirchzarten, with a commandery at Freyburg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCELY ABBEY of PRUM.</HEAD>
<P>This abbey lies in the forest of Ardennes, be∣twixt the bailiwics of Schoneck and Schonberg, belonging to the electorate of Triers. It was founded in the eighth century by Pepin, king of the Franks, and his consort, and in 1570 was in∣corporated with the archbishopric of Triers. From that time the archbishops became administrators of it, and, as such, have now a seat and vote in the diets. Their matricular assessment, on account of it, is one horsemen and thirteen foot, and to the chamber of Wetzlar, eleven rix-dollars, five kruit∣zers. The abbey hath lost a great part of the lands and casualties formerly belonging to it. In the year 1361 its revenue was computed at four thousand
<PB N="64" REF="630"/>
gold guldens, or guilders; but now, it is said, does not amount to above fifteen thousand rix-dollars. Prum, near which the abbey stands, and from which it takes its name, is a small place on a ri∣vulet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of SIMMERN.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy lies in the Hundsruck, or Hunsruck, or the Pagus Hunicus of the ancients. It was long possessed by a collateral branch of the Pala∣tine family; but that failing at last, it again devolved to the electors, who, on that account, sit and vote in the college of princes, and are sum∣moning princes for this circle jointly with the bi∣shop of Worms. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Simmern, which gives name to it, and takes its own from the river on which it stands, twenty∣five miles south of Coblentz, and thirty west of Mentz. Here all the three religions have churches.</P>
<P>Laubach, Horrein, Argenthal, Sobernheim, and Montzingen, are all small towns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of LAUTERN.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy or principality, together with that of Simmern, and the anterior county of Sponheim, were bequeathed in 1610, by the elector-palatine Frederic IV. to his second son, Lewis Philip, and his heirs; but upon the death of that prince, with his consort and son, Lewis-Henry, the whole re∣verted to the electoral house, which is thereby en∣titled to a vote in the diets.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="65" REF="640"/>
<HEAD>VELDENZ and LAUTEREN.</HEAD>
<P>The bailiwics denominated from these two small towns or boroughs once belonged to a separate branch of the Palatine family, who, in 1566, were made princes of the empire, with right of a seat and vote in the diets; but are now possessed by the elector. The former lies upon the Moselle, and is surrounded on all sidesby the electorate of Triers; but the latter lies upon the river Glan.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of DEUX-PONTS.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy, at present, consists of the antient county of Deux-Ponts, or Zwey-brucken, as it is called in the German, and some parts of the county of Veldenz. It gives title of duke to a branch of the electoral family, heretofore dukes of Berkenfield, who succeeded to it in 1733, by vir∣tue of a compact with the elector, and who are en∣titled by it to a seat and vote in the diets of the em∣pire and of this circle. Its matricular assessment is ten horse and thirty foot, or two hundred and forty florins, monthly, in lieu of them, and to the chamber of Wetzlar one hundred and seventy-two rix-dollars, thirty-six kruitzers, but a part of this assessment is deducted for the bailiwic of Stradecken, now belonging to the elector. The revenues of the duchy are computed at three hundred thousand flo∣rins. The only places in it worth mentioning are, Deux-ponts, called in German Zwey-brucken, Hornbach, Anweiler, Minfeld, Langenhandel, Kleeburg, Kussel, Meissenheim, Odenbach, Odern∣heim, and Upper Muschel. Deux-ponts gives name to the duchy, and is its capital. It contains also a fine ducal palace and a gymnasium. The rest are small places. Kleburg has a wall and castle, and
<PB N="66" REF="650"/>
once gave title to a branch of the house of Deux-ponts, as Landsberg, now a ruined castle, did to another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HESSE.</HEAD>
<P>The landgravate of Hesse is bounded by the bi∣shopric of Fulda, the principality of Hersfeld, Thuringia, and Eichsfeld, as also by that of Calen∣burg, the bishopric of Paderborn, and Waldeck, the duchy of Westphalia, the county of Witgen∣stein, Nassau-Dillenburg, the county of Solins, and Upper-Isenburg. In the above limits, the county of Katzenellnbogen and some other terri∣tories are not included. The whole country, in its utmost length, is near an hundred miles, and in some places near as much in breadth. The air is cold, but wholesome, and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture. The country abounds also in cattle, fish, and game, salt-springs, baths, and mineral waters. The hills, which are many, yield silver, copper, lead, iron, allum, vitriol, pit-coal, sulphur, boles, a porcelain earth, mar∣ble, and alabaster. In the Eder gold is some∣times found, and at Frankenberg a gold mine was formerly wrought. Besides many lesser streams, Hesse is watered by the following rivers, viz. the Lahn, the Fulda, the Eder or Schwalm, the Werra or Weser, and Diemel. The Rhine also and the Mayne pass through the country of Katze∣nellnbogen. This country, like most others in Germany, has its states, consisting of the prelates, as they are called, the nobility, and the towns. The diets are divided into general and particular, and the latter into the greater and smaller committees. The house of Hesse is divided into two principal branches, viz. Cassel, and Darmstadt, of which Philipsdale, Rhinfels, and Homburg, are collate∣ral
<PB N="67" REF="660"/>
branches, the two first of Hesse-Cassel, and the last of Hesse-Darmstadt. Their rights and pri∣vileges are very considerable. In particular, they have several votes at the diets of the empire, and causes, not exceeding a thousand florins, are de∣termined by the courts of the country, without appeal. The princes of Hesse-Cassel are not of age till they are twenty-five, but those of Hesse-Darmstadt are so at eighteen. The right of pri∣mogeniture hath been established in both houses. The revenues of Darmstadt are said to amount to near an hundred thousand pounds a year, and those of Hesse-Cassel to near two hundred thousand. The small county of Schaumberg alone yields a revenue of ten thousand pounds, and that of Katze∣nellnbogen, with the forests of Richardswalde, it is said, was farmed near two hundred years ago at twelve thousand pounds. The prince of Hesse Cassel has forty or fifty thousand men in his dominions fit to bear arms, and the troops that he hires out have often brought him in large sums, especially from Great-Britain. The branches of Cassel, Homburg, and Phi∣lipsdale, are Calvinists, that of Darmstadt Luthe∣rans, and that of Rhinfelds Roman catholics. The present prince of Hesse-Cassel, indeed, in the year 1749, embraced the Roman catholic religion; but in 1754 drew up, and confirmed by oath, an instru∣ment, of which all the Protestant princes are gua∣rantees, declaring, that the established religion of his dominions should continue in every respect as before, and that his children should be brought up, and instructed therein. Here, as in the other protestant Lutheran countries of Germany, are consistories, superintendents, and inspectors of the church. In the whole landgraviate are three uni∣versities, besides Latin schools and gymnasia, for the education of youth. The manufactures of Hesse are linen cloth, hats, stockings, gloves,
<PB N="68" REF="670"/>
paper, goldsmiths wares, and at Cassel a beautiful porcelain is made. This is supposed to have been the country of the antient Catti, mentioned by Tacitus, &amp;c. who, in after-ages, were called Chatti, Chassi, Hassi, and Hessi. The two chief branches of Cassel and Darmstadt have ma∣ny rights and privileges in common, which we have not room to specify. Both of them have a seat and vote in the college of princes at the diet of the empire, and those of this circle. The matri∣cular assessment of Hesse-Cassel is one thousand and ninety-six florins, forty-five kruitzers, and that of Darmstadt six hundred and sixty-three florins. To the chamber of Wetzlar Hesse-Cassel pays about four hundred and ninety-eight rix-dollars, and Hesse-Darmstadt three hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, eighteen kruitzers. Each of these princes, besides their guards and militia, maintains a consi∣derable body, both of horse and foot. The coun∣try is at present commonly divided into the Upper and Lower-Hesse. The principal places in the former belonging to Hesse-Cassel are,</P>
<P>Marburg, the capital, situate on a hill, near the river Lahn, upwards of forty miles south-west from Cassel. It was once a free imperial city, but after∣wards subject to its own lords, and is now the seat of the joint court of justice for Hesse-Cassel and Darmstadt, and also of the court of appeals for six years, alternately with Giessen. Here is a strong castle on a hill, with other fortifications. The uni∣versity, founded in 1527 by the landgrave Philip the Magnanimous, is one of the most considerable in Germany, and is well endowed. The professors are Calvinists. In this town also is an academy for classical learning, three Calvinist churches, a fine stud, and a house in which the commander of the Teutonic Order for Hesse resides. In the Lu∣theran church of St. Elizabeth, besides the tomb
<PB N="69" REF="680"/>
of the saint plated over with silver-gilt, there is one of alabaster, of Augustus, count von der Lippe, the first Lutheran commander of the Teutonic order for Hesse; for this commander is chosen alternately out of the three religions. In the bailiwic, to which the town gives name, are mines of silver, copper, and iron, with quarries of slate.</P>
<P>Kirchbain, a small town on the Wohra, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Rauschenberg, a small town, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Wetter, a small town, which gives name to a bailiwic, and formerly contained an abbey, the re∣venues of which were allotted, by Philip the Mag∣nanimous, to the portioning the daughters of an∣tient noble families.</P>
<P>Rosenthal, a small town, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Gemunden on the Wohra, a small town, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Frankenberg, a very antient town, situate on the Eder, and giving name to a bailiwic, in which not only lead and copper, but even silver and gold have been found.</P>
<P>Louisendorf, a town in the bailiwic of Geismar, inhabited chiefly by French refugees.</P>
<P>Frankenau, a small town in the bailiwic of Hes∣senstein.</P>
<P>Haina, a town situate on the Wohra, and con∣taining one of the four high hospitals of Hesse, in which four hundred poor and sick are carefully at∣tended, and maintained out of the revenues of a Cistercian convent. The governors of these hos∣pitals are nobles, nominated alternately by the two princes of Hesse.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="70" REF="690"/>
<HEAD>The principal Places in LOWER-HESSE, belong∣ing to Hesse-Cassel, are,</HEAD>
<P>Cassel, the capital and residence of that branch, which is denominated from it, and the seat of their chief courts and colleges. It stands on both sides of the Fulda, being divided by the river into the old and new towns, which have a communication by a bridge. The French or upper new town is very regular and handsome, but the other parts are old∣fashioned. Cassel lies sixty-eight miles south-west from Hanover, forty south-east from Paderborn, and eighty-eight from Munster, eighty-five north∣east from Francfort, and ninety-eight from Mentz. The landgrave's palace, which stands in the old town by the river, is well fortified, and commands one of the finest prospects in the world, no fewer than sixty towns, it is said, being included within it. Here is also a fine arsenal, a mint, an academy, an anatomical theatre, a museum, an observatory, a foundery, and an aqueduct, together with a noble library, green-house, marble bath, and parterre, be∣longing to the prince, barracks for the garrison, and several churches, one of which, viz. that of St. Martin's abbey, is capable of containing four thou∣sand people. In the same church are the monu∣ments of the landgraves, some of which are of very curious workmanship. In the French new-town stands another palace of the prince's, with a fine gal∣lery of pictures. The town gives name to a baili∣wic, in which is Kaufungen, antiently a Benedictine nunnery, whose revenues the landgrave Philip the Magnanimous assigned for portioning the daugh∣ters of antient noble families. In the neighbour∣ing bailiwic of Baune are two pleasure-houses be∣longing to the prince; on a mountain also in the same bailiwic, is a grand cascade, with a pyramid of huge stones, surmounted by a Hercules of cop∣per,
<PB N="71" REF="700"/>
thirty feet high, besides a curious grotto of rough hewn stone, and a giant reclined on his back, ejecting a stream of water six inches in diameter, to the height of forty feet. The cascade, which consists of four platforms, with a spacious bason to each, is supplied with water from several streams on the mountain, collected in a large reservoir one hun∣dred feet deep. The prospect from this place is inexpressibly fine.</P>
<P>Lichtenau, a small town, giving name to a bai∣liwic, in which formerly stood the seat of Reichen∣bach, from which the counts of Reichenbach take their title.</P>
<P>Spangenberg, an antient castle, giving name to a small town and bailiwic, in which are some vine∣yards, with a rock of beautiful white alabaster, near the village of Connefeld.</P>
<P>Melsungen, a small town, containing a seat of the prince's, and giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Friedwald, a small town, in the neighbourhood of which is a seat belonging to the prince. It also gives name to a bailiwic, containing a wood, and quarries of stone.</P>
<P>Vach, or Fach, a little town on the Werra, which gives name to a bailiwic, and is a great tho∣roughfare betwixt Leipzig and Frankfort on the Mayne.</P>
<P>Waldkappel, a small town, giving name to a bai∣liwic, in which are some coal-pits.</P>
<P>Allendorf, a small town, giving name to a bai∣liwic, in which are some salt-works.</P>
<P>Grebenstein, a small town situate on the Esse, and giving name to a bailiwic. On the bridge over the river here is held, in the open air, what is called the bridge-court, where every defendant is obliged to deposite a fine, which, on his acquittal, is returned him, and the plaintiff immersed in double the sum.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="710"/>
Immenhausen, a small town, situate on the skirts of Rheinhard's forest, and giving name to a baili∣wic, in which is an iron mine, and some high mountains.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY and HOUSE of NASSAU.</HEAD>
<P>The principality of Nassau lies mostly in the Wetterau. The length of it is computed at about fifty miles, and the breadth thereof about thirty. Though it is, in general, woody and mountainous, there are some fine pastures and corn-lands in it, besides excellent baths and mineral waters, and several mines of iron, lead, copper, and other me∣tals. Most of the princes and inhabitants are Cal∣vinists. The principality is divided into several counties belonging to the different branches of the family, which is one of the most antient and illus∣trious of Europe, having produced, besides many other great heroes, Adolphus, emperor of Ger∣many, and king William III. of Great Britain. The elder line, or that of Walram, consists, at present, of the branches of Nassau-Saarbruck-Usin∣gen, Nassau-Saarbruck-Saarbruck, and Nassau-Weilburg. The representative of the last of these is married to the present prince of Orange's only sister. The other line, or that of Otho, which consisted formerly of the several branches of Nas∣sau-Siegen, which was popish, Nassau-Dillenburg, Dietz, and Hadamar, is now reduced to that of Nassau-Dietz, the representative of which, Wil∣liam V. prince of Orange, enjoys all the territories that belonged to the other branches, and on ac∣count of them has several votes in the diet of the empire, and those of this circle, and Westphalia. All the branches pay a matricular and chamber taxation; but those of the elder line have no seat or votes in the college of the princes of the empire, being only members of that of the imperial Wette∣rau courts.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of WALDECK.</HEAD>
<P>This county terminates southward on Hesse, northward on the diocese of Paderborn, westward on the duchy of Westphalia, and eastward on Hesse, and the bailiwic of Fritzlar, in the electorate of Mentz. Its length is computed at about twen∣ty-four, and its breadth at twenty miles. It yields iron, lead, copper, marble, slate, mineral springs, and abounds in grain, wood, and cattle. Gold is sometimes found in the river Eder. The inhabi∣tants in general are Lutherans. The states consist of the nobility and towns. There are some woollen manufactures, besides those of iron and paper, in the county. The title of the family of Waldeck runs thus: Waldeck, prince of the sacred Roman empire, count of Pyrmont and Rappolstein, lord of Hoheneck and Gerolseck, &amp;c. The females, notwithstanding, are only countesses. The prince has not yet obtained a seat and voice among the princes in the diet of the empire, but in that of this circle he has. To the empire, his assessment for Waldeck is four horse, and eighteen foot, or an hundred and twenty florins, monthly, in lieu of them, and to the chamber of Wetzlar sixty-seven rix-dollars, seventy-four kruitzers. The county is a fief of Hesse-Cassel, the succession to which was first settled on the eldest son and his issue in the year 1697. Here are the usual high courts and colleges, for the government of the county and the
<PB N="87" REF="860"/>
administration of justice. As to the revenue of the county, it is said to amount to above one hundred thousand rix-dollars per annum, and the prince ge∣nerally maintains five companies of foot. The chief places here are,</P>
<P>Corbach, the capital of the county, divided into the old and new town, which contain a gym∣nasium, with two churches, in one of which is a stately monument of marble and alabaster, erected by the states of the United Provinces to the prinde of Waldeck, who was field-marshal of their forces.</P>
<P>Lower Weldungen, a pretty large well built town, having the epithet of Lower, to distinguish it from Old Weldungen, a small town with a castle, called Frederichstein.

In its neighbourhood also are some mineral springs.</P>
<P>Mengeringhausen, Sachsenhausen, Rhoden, Sachsenberg, Landau, Freienhagen, Waldeck, Zuschen, Furstenberg, all small towns. In Rho∣den is a seat of the prince's. Near Waldeck stands an old castle, which gives name to the county, and title to the prince.</P>

<HEAD>The county of HANAU-MUNZENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This country lies not all contiguous. The greatest part of it is surrounded by the elec∣torate of Mentz, the bishopric of Fulda, the lord∣ships of Reineck, Isenburg, and Solms; as also by the territories of Hesse-Homburg, Burg-Fried∣burg, and Frankfort. Its length is near forty miles, but its greatest breadth not above twelve. It is exceeding fertile in corn, wine, wood, and fruits, yielding also salt-springs, with some silver, copper, and cobalt. The rivers by which it is chiefly watered are, the Mayne, the Kinzeg, and the Nidda. Both the Lutherans and catholics are tolerated, but the prevailing religion is Calvinism. The country is populous, and trade and manufac∣tures flourish in it. In 1736 the whole male-line of the counts of Hanau failing in John Reinard, William VIII. landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, by vir∣tue of a treaty of mutual succession between the families of Hanau and Hesse-Cassel, took possession of the county, satisfaction having been first made to the house of Saxony for their claims, and in the year 1754 transferred it to prince William, eldest son to the then hereditary prince Frederic, now landgrave. The assessment of the county to the empire is two hundred and thirty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar, an hundred and sixty rix-dollars, twenty-nine kruitzers. The revenues of the last count, arising from this and other territo∣ries, is said to have amounted to five hundred thousand florins. The chief places in the county are,</P>
<P>Hanau, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal, standing pleasantly on the river Kenzig, near where it falls into the Mayne. The river divides it into the old and new towns, both of which are
<PB N="89" REF="880"/>
fortified. The new town, which was built at first by Flemish and French refugees, who had great privileges granted to them, is regular and hand∣some. The castle, in which the counts used to reside, and which stands in the old town, is forti∣fied, and has a fine flower-garden, with commo∣dious apartments, but makes no great appearance. The Jews are tolerated here, and dwell in a parti∣cular quarter. The magistracy of the new town, and the disposal of all offices in it, belong to the French and Dutch congregations. Here is an uni∣versity, with several manufactures, particularly that of roll-tobacco, and a very considerable traffic.

<HEAD>TERRITORIES belonging to the princes of SOLMS.</HEAD>
<P>The house of Solms is divided into a great many branches, of which those of Solms-Laubach-Sonne∣wald, and Solms-Laubach-Baruth, with their col∣lateral branches, have their estates in Lusatia and the electorate of Saxony. The matricular assess∣ment of those of this circle is two hundred and fifty-two florins, and, to the chamber of Wetzlar, about an hundred and thirty rix-dollars. In the diet of the empire, and the college of the imperial counts of the Wetterau, they have four votes, and the like number in the diets of this circle. The lines of Braunfels and Hohen-Solms are Calvinist, that of Sonnenwald catholic, and all the rest Lutheran. In the territory of Solms-Braunfels, the places worth mentioning are,</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of KONIGSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies in the Wetterau, along a ridge of mountains called the Hohe. The elector of Mentz at present possesses nearly the whole of the county, a small part only being held by the counts of Stolberg, who however claim the whole; ac∣cordingly a process is depending before the aulic council about the title to it. In the mean time both these princes vote, on account of it, in the diet of the Upper-Rhine, and both are members of the college of the imperial Wetterau counts. Of the matricular assessment for Konigstein, Mentz pays eighty florins, and Stolberg twenty. The only places in the county worth mentioning are,</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of UPPER-ISENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies in the Wetterau, and is called Upper-Isenburg, to distinguish it from the county of Lower-Isenburg, in the Palatinate. It was made a county in 1442, having been only a lordship be∣fore. It is a fine corn country, watered by seve∣ral brooks, contains some considerable woods and vineyards, and belongs partly to the house of Isenburg, of which there are several branches, some princes, and others counts, partly to Hesse-Darmstadt, and partly to the counts of Stolberg. The house of Isenburg has a seat in the diets of this circle, and also among the Wetterau courts, in those of the em∣pire, paying a matricular, and other assessments. The principal places in the county are,</P>
<P>Birstein, a town, which, with its district, belongs to the prince of Isenburg-Birstein. In the district are some iron-mines.</P>
<P>Wenings, a small town, belonging, with its di∣strict, to the same prince.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the WILD and RHINE-GRAVES, and their TERRITORIES.</HEAD>
<P>The wild, or wald, or rau-graves, in Latin comites saltuarii, forestarii silvestres, &amp; hirsuti, were so called from their rough and woody territo∣ries, which, as well as those of the rhine-graves, lay dispersed about the Rhine, between Basil and Bon. In the twelfth century, the territories of the former fell to the latter, from whom are descended the counts of Salm, of whose territory some ac∣count has already been given, the counts of Grum∣bach, the rhine-graves of Stein, and wild-graves of Dhaun and Kirburg. Each reigning house sits and votes in the diets of this circle, and in those of the empire, in the college of the imperial counts of the Wetterau, paying each a matricular assess∣ment, and also to the chamber at Wetzlar. The wild and rhine-grave lands are mostly fiefs.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the TERRITORY of the COUNTS of GRUMBACH the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Grumbach, a town which gives name to a lord∣ship or bailiwic, lying on the river Glan, and afford∣ing
<PB N="96" REF="950"/>
amethysts, agate, cornelians, and mocha-stones. Near the town is the seat of the counts.</P>
<P>Tronecken, a village, standing on the rivulet Tron, and giving name to a lordship which lies on the Hunsruck; and contains also Falfang, a market-town, and fourteen villages.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the TERRITORY of the RHINE-GRAVES of STEIN, the only places of any account are,</HEAD>
<P>Rhingrafenstein, a ruined castle, from which the county, otherwise called the rhingraviate of Stein, took its name. It stood on a high rock, and was exceeding strong, before it was demolished by the French in 1688.</P>
<P>Grehweiler, a little town, where the rhine-graves, in 1747, built a stately seat.</P>
<P>Wildenburg, a castle, which gives name to a lordship and bailiwic, on the Hunsruck, yielding about one thousand seven hundred florins per ann.</P>
<P>Worstall, a large village, giving name to a di∣strict, which brings in about one thousand three hundred florins; there are other estates, which be∣longed to the family of Dhaun, now extinct, of which, or at least the greater part, the princes of Salm, the counts of Grumbach, and the rhine-graves of Stein, are now proprietors.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the Wild-gravate of DHAUN the most considera∣ble places are,</HEAD>
<P>Dhaun, a fine seat, standing on a high hill near the river Simmern, and giving name to the wild∣gravate.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>The TERR TORIES of the HOUSE of LEININGEN.</HEAD>
<P>The territories belonging to the house of Leinin∣gen, in this circle, consist of the county of Leinin∣gen, and the lordship of Westerburg.</P>
<P>The county of Leiningen, which lies partly on the Upper-Rhine, and is almost wholly environed by the Palatinate, is very fertile in corn, yielding also a great deal of wood and game, with mines of iron and copper, and quarries of stone. The counts to whom it belongs are divided into two branches or lines, each of which are subdivided into two others. The first of the two principal lines stile themselves counts of Leiningen, lords of Westerburg, &amp;c. the other, counts of Leiningen and Dachburg, lords of Aspremont, &amp;c. Both lines vote at the diets of the empire, in the college of the Wetterau counts, and also in the diets of this circle; and both are taxed in the matricula, and to the cham∣ber of Wetzlar. The principal places in the coun∣ty are,</P>
<P>Grunstadt, a pretty large and handsome town, in which are seats belonging to the two branches of the elder line, with churches for the three religi∣ons, and a Capuchin convent. The town has a good estate, consisting of corn-lands and vine∣yards, which, with its fairs, render it a thriving place.</P>
<P>Old Leiningen, a castle on a hill, giving name to the county.</P>
<P>New Leiningen, a small town in the vale of Leiningen.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="970"/>
Durheim-ander-Hart, a little town, in which the counts of the younger line reside.</P>
<P>The lordship of Westerburg lies in the Wes∣terwald, and is surrounded by the territories of the elector of Triers, and those of the house of Nassau, being a fruitful soil, and yield∣ing, besides excellent pasture and fruits of all kinds, rye, barley, oats, pulse, and a kind of coal, which, from its colour, filaments, &amp;c. ap∣pears to have been once real wood. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Westerburg, a considerable town, which gives name to the lordship, and contains an old castle, and a feat belonging to one of the branches of the elder line; the two branches of which are jointly, or separately, proprietors of the town and lord∣ship.</P>
<P>Weltersburg, or Waltersburg, a walled coun∣try town, which formerly gave name to a particu∣lar lordship, now reckoned a part of Westerburg.</P>
<P>To the elder line belong also the lordship of Shadec, on the Lahn, opposite the town of Run∣kee, and that of Forbach, lying in Westreich, not far from Saarbruck. In the town of Schadec is a castle, in which the dowagers usually reside; and near it is a place, where the principal civil officers, in the month of May, hold a court in the open air.</P>
<P>To the younger branch of the Leiningen counts belong some places in Alsace, and the lordship of Bruch, in the duchy of Berg.</P>
<P>Munzfelden is an imperial castle and village, ly∣ing between Dietz and Kirchberg, and entitling to a seat and vote in the diet of this circle, to which its quota is fifty-four kruitzers. The elector of Triers, and the prince of Nassau-Usingen, are joint owners of it.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of WITGENSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is about eighteen miles in length, and fourteen in breadth, is environed by the territories of Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau-Dillenburg, and the duchy of Westphalia. It produces little grain, but good pasture, and plenty of wood, with mines of silver, copper, and iron, and is watered by the rivers Lahn and Eder. The counts, who are of the same family as those of Sayn, are divided into the two branches of Sayn-Witgenstein of Witgenstein, and Sayn-Witgenstein of Berleburg. The county entitles both branches to a vote in the college of the Wetterau counts, both at the diet of the empire, and those of this circle. Their matri∣cular assessment is twenty-eight florins, of which each branch pays his proportion. The revenue of the county of Witgenstein, including that of the lordship of Homburg, which lies between the duchy of Berg, and the county of Mark, and be∣longs to the counts of Witgenstein, is computed at fifty thousand rix-dollars. In this county the only places deserving notice are,</P>
<P>Witgenstein, a castle, seated on a high moun∣tain, the residence of the counts of Sayn-Witgen∣stein, of Witgenstein. Near it stands Laasphe, a small town on the Lahn.</P>
<P>Berleburg, a small town on the little river Ber∣len, containing a fine palace, belonging, with the town to the count of Sayn-Witgenstein-Berleburg.</P>

duchy of Lautern; westward by the bailiwic of Landsberg, belonging to Deuxponts; and east∣ward by the county of Wartemberg, and the lord∣ship of Kircheim, in the territories of Nassau-Weilburg. The present emperor, who is propri∣etor of it, is intitled by it to a vote in the college of princes, at the diet of the empire, and in those of this circle, paying, on account of it, an assess∣ment to the empire and the chamber of Wetzlar. The only places worth mentioning are,</P>

<P>This lordship, which takes its name from a castle on the mountain, called the Hunsruck, in the Palatinate, belongs to the count of Hillesheim, whom it entitles to a seat and vote in the diets of this circle, but not in those of the empire. It pays, however, an assessment to the empire, the circle, and chamber of Wetzlar.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LORDSHIP of KIRCHINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This lordship, or county, which takes its name from a little town on the river Nidda, lies in the Westreich, and some part of it is subject to France.

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LORDSHIP of BRITZENHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>This lordship lies on the Nahe, adjoining to the county of Sponheim.

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which stands on the west side of the Rhine, ten miles from Manheim, and as many from Heidelberg, was antiently the capital of the Vangiones, and is called by Marcellinus, Vangio; by Antoninus, Bormilomagus; and by Ptolemy, Borbetomagus. It was at first an archbishopric; but, in 750, pope Zachary made it suffragan to Mentz, whither he transferred the archiepiscopal see. As an imperial city, it has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, paying, as such, an assessment to the empire, and the cham∣ber of Wetzlar: yet the bishops contest its inde∣pendence, and, in several respects indeed, act as sovereigns of it. It stands not far from the Rhine, in a fine spacious plain, abounding with fruit, corn, and wine, and is under the protection of the elector Palatine. The magistrates, and many of the inhabitants, are Lutherans; but the Papists have several convents and churches in it. Among the latter is the cathedral. Here is also a palace for the bishop, a Calvinist church, a Jesuits col¦lege, and a gymnasium under the direction of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order. The neighbourhood of the city is noted for a wine called our Lady's-milk. The bishop is ge¦nerally one of the ecclesiastic electors, and there¦fore seldom resides here. The city is said to be a large as Frankfort on the Mayne, but is now i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inhabited and poor. Several diets have been held and other important matters transacted in it; an here it was that the Reformation in 1525 began Worms has met with many misfortunes; but suf¦fered most in 1689 from the French, who in
<PB N="103" REF="1020"/>
few hours laid in ashes what had been the work of ages.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of SPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This city stands in a delightful plain, on the east side of the Rhine, where it receives the small river Spirebach, twelve miles south-west of Heidelberg, and as many south of Manheim. It is thought to be Julius Caesar's Nemetum Civitas, or Novio∣magum, and to have been built by the Belgae long before our Saviour's time, and conquered by the Nemetes. The see, which is suffragan to the archbishop of Mentz, is said to have been founded in the fourth century. The magistrates of the city are Lutherans, and likewise most of the inhabi∣tants; but the Papists have many churches and convents in it. As a free imperial city it has seat and vote in the diets of the empire, and those of the circle, paying an assessment to the empire and the chamber of Wetzlar. It has been entirely re∣built since the year 1689, when it was totally de∣stroyed by the French, whose brutality was such, that they broke to pieces several fine marble monu∣ments of emperors and empresses, and scattered about the bones of the illustrious dead. Before that fatal year it was the seat of the imperial cham∣ber. The name of protestants took its first rise here at the diet held in 1529. The city will not allow the bishop to reside in it. When a new bishop is chosen, before he enters the city, he re∣dresses all complaints; and afterwards, sitting on horseback in the open air, betwixt the two outer∣most gates, which during the ceremony are shut, with one hand on his left-breast, he pronounces a blessing on the city, then binds himself not to in∣fringe its privileges, but rather to maintain and in∣crease them, and to live in peace and harmony
<PB N="104" REF="1030"/>
with it. After that he makes his public entry, and the citizens pay him homage. It is no better fortified than Worms; and, like that city, is un∣der the protection of the elector Palatine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of FRANKFORT on the MAYNE.</HEAD>
<P>This city is situated on the Mayne, by which it is distinguished from the other of the same name on the Order. It is a large, populous, rich city, and stands in a delightful country. Here the emperor and king of the Romans are usually elected, and crowned; and, in the town-house, in a casket of gold, is kept the famous golden bull, which is written in Latin capitals, on forty-three quarto leaves of parchment, in the form of a book. The magistrates, and a great part of the inhabitants, are Lutherans or Calvinists; but most of the churches are in the hands of the Papists, who have also several convents in the city. The other churches and convents belong to the Lutherans. As for the Calvinists, they are obliged to go to Bocken∣heim, a town at a small distance, for worship. The city has two great annual fairs, and several flourishing manufactures, particularly of silk, por∣celain, and tobacco. A vast number of horses, and great quantities of books, are bought and sold at its fairs. There are many fine palaces and public structures in the city. The Jews, who are numerous, are confined to a particular quarter. The territory belonging to the city, is of a consi∣derable extent; and the trade carried on by the Mayne and Rhine of great importance. The em∣peror is elected in a small chapel, in the cathedral of St. Bartholomew, and crowned in another. After his coronation he dines in the town-house; in which also the states of this circle used formerly to

Frankfort being an imperial city, has a seat and vote in the diets of the empire, and this circle, paying an assessment to the empire and the cham∣ber of Wetzlar. It has a fine bridge over the Mayne of fourteen arches.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of FRIEDBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which lies twelve miles north from Frankfort, on the ridge of hills called the Hohe, was formerly larger than at present. It is a free imperial Lutheran city, having a seat and vote in the diets of the empire and of this circle; and paying an assessment to the empire and the cham∣ber of Wetzlar. However, it is in some respects subject to the burgrave, or, at least, he shares in the administration. The city has suffered much by fires, and is noted for the depth of its cellars, of which there are in some houses two or three, one under another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The IMPERIAL TOWN of WETZLAR.</HEAD>
<P>This town is seated on the Lahn, eighteen miles south-west from Marpurg, and thirty-one north from Frankfort. The magistracy, with the great∣est part of the burghers, are Lutherans. Here the imperial chamber is held, having been removed hither after the destruction of Spire by the French in 1693. Hesse-Darmstadt, as protector of the city, maintains a company of soldiers in it, and has a representative in the council. There are se∣veral churches in the town belonging to the three religions, besides a college of Jesuits, a Francis∣can
<PB N="106" REF="1060"/>
convent, and a house, or commandery, of the Teutonic order. The town, as imperial, has a seat and vote in the diets of the empire, and of this cir∣cle, paying an assessment to the empire, but none to the chamber court.</P>
<P>The lordships of Schaunburg and Oberstein, tho' they are within this circle and pay assessments, have neither vote nor seat in the diets. The former lies on the Lahn in the lower county of Katzenellnbogen, and belongs to a branch of the house of Anhalt, which pays, as an assessment for it to the empire, two florins, forty kruitzers; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, seventy-four rix-dollars. It takes its name from a seat on a high hill, not far from the Lahn. The latter lies on the Hunsruck, along the Nahe, and belongs to the count of Leining-Dachsburg-Heidesheim, taking its name from a little town on the Nahe, and paying to the em∣pire seven florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar ten rix-dollars, seventy-three kruitzers.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of FRANCONIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded by the circles of Bavaria, Swabia, the Upper and Lower Rhine, Upper Saxony, and Bohemia, and is one of the smallest in the empire. The states of the circle are, Bamberg, Wurtzburg, Brandenburg, Bayreuth, Eichstadt, Brandenburg-Anspach, the Teutonic order, Henneburg-Schleusingen, Hen∣neberg-Romhild, Henneberg-Schmalkalden, Schwarzenburg, Lowenstein-Wertheim, Hohen∣lohe-Waldenburg, Hohenlohe-Newenstein, Castel, Wertheim, Rieneck, Erbach, Limburg-Gieldorf, Limburg-Speckfeld, Seinsheim, Rugelsberg, Wie∣senthied, Wilzheim, and Hauzen, with the im∣perial cities of Nurenberg, Rothenberg, Wind∣sheim, Schweinfurt, and Weisenburg. The bi∣shop of Bamberg, and the margraves of Branden∣burg-Bayreuth, and Anspach, are summoning princes for the circle; but the bishop is sole direc∣tor. The diets have, for a long time, been generally held at Nuremberg, but the chancery and archives are kept at Bamberg. In the year 1682, the mili∣tary establishment of the whole empire, in time of peace, having been fixed at forty thousand men, the quota of this circle was nine hundred and eighty horse, and one thousand nine hundred and two foot; and of the three hundred thousand florins granted to the operation-chest of the empire in 1707, its quota amounted to twenty-two thou∣sand six hundred and ninety-six. With regard to religion, it is one of the mixed. Of the assessors of the imperial chamber it nominates two, the one a Roman catholic and the other a protestant.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of BAMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is bounded to the north by the principality of Coburg and the Voghtland; to the south by the principality of Brandenburg-Bay∣reuth, the territory of Nurenburg, or Nurnberg, and the principality of Schwarzenburg; to the west by the bishopric of Wurzburg; and to the east by the territory of Nurnberg and Branden∣burg-Bayreuth. The length of it is about sixty miles, and the breadth forty. The soil is very fertile in corn, wine, saffron, and liquorice, yield∣ing also, in some places, laurel, fig, lemon, and orange-trees, with woods of forest-trees, and some metals. The country abounds likewise in cattle, and is well watered by the Mayne and several other rivers and brooks that fall into it. The inhabi∣tants are all zealous Roman catholics. Here are no states. Before the year 1006, this country was called the county of Babenberg, and had counts of its own; but was then allotted for a bi∣shopric by the emperor Henry II. which pope Be∣nedict VIII. exempted from all archiepiscopal ju∣risdiction. The bishop's privileges and preroga∣tives are very great. He is the only one in Ger∣many, who has the privilege of wearing a cardinal's hat, together with the pallium, the last of which, however, costs him four thousand pounds; and there lies no appeal from his decisions in secular matters to the courts of the empire. The king of Bohemia is his cup-bearer, the elector-palatine his steward, the elector of Saxony his grand-marshal, and the elector of Brandenburg his great chamberlain. These, or their proxies, if summoned must attend, and do the duties of their offices on the day of his installation. He is able to bring into the field four
<PB N="109" REF="1090"/>
or five thousand men. The revenue arising from his bishopric, besides his bailiwics in Carinthia, amounts to above fifty thousand pounds. The chapter, by whom the bishop is elected, consists of twenty capitular canons, and fifteen domicelli, all of noble birth. All his estates, excepting those in Carinthia, are held immediately of the empire. At the diet thereof he has the fourth place on the spiritual bench in the college of princes, and is a summoning prince and director of this circle, as we observed above. His matricular assessment, at present, is only four hundred and thirty-seven flo∣rins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar five hundred and seventy-four rix-dollars, each term. Here are all the usual courts, councils, and offices for the different departments of government, as war, foreign affairs, the finances, &amp;c. and the follow∣ing are the chief places in the bishopric,</P>
<P>Bamberg, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, pleasantly situate near the river Rednitz, about thirty-four miles north of Nurenberg, and in the centre of Germany. It is surrounded with walls and a ditch, and is, in general, well built and populous. Here are two episcopal palaces or castles, one called Petersburg, and the other Gayerswerth, an university founded in 1648, seve∣ral monasteries, nunneries, and churches, besides the cathedral of St. George, in which is the mo∣nument of Henry II. who founded the bishopric, and his consort Cunigunda, with a treasure of jewels and relicks. Several diets both of the empire and circle have been held here. Not far from the town stands the bishop's summer palace, called Mar∣quardsburg. Among other curiosities in the trea∣sury of the church of St. George, is a folio manu∣script of the four Gospels in Latin, upon fine vel∣lum, in a neat Roman character, with some Go∣thic
<PB N="110" REF="1100"/>
letters intermixed, and the most beautiful mi∣niatures to be seen any where. The binding is of wood covered with curious sculptures in ivory of our Saviour's passion, and bordered with a gold edging, on which are the heads of our Lord and his apostles, with those of the evangelists at the four corners. The whole is enamelled, and the intervals between the figures are garnished with pearls and precious stones. The city is a great thoroughfare. A part of the road leading to it from Nurenberg lies through a forest of fir-trees, and is lined with gibbets and wheels, on which are exposed the bo∣dies of such as have been executed for murders and robberies committed in the forest.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of WURTZBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is bounded by the bishopric of Bamberg, the principality of Schwarzenburg, the county of Castel, the Limburg seigniory of Speck∣feld, the principality of Brandenburg-Anspach, the seigniory of Rothenburg, the county of Ho∣henlohe, the Teutonic territory of Mergentheim, the county of Wertheim, the archbishopric of Mentz, the counties of Rieneck and Henneberg, the principality of Coburg, and the territory of Fulda. It extends upwards of eighty miles in length, and sixty in breadth, and is fertile in corn, wine, fruits, plants, and pasture, and well
<PB N="112" REF="1120"/>
watered by the Mayne, the Franconian Saal, the Tauber, and Juxt. There are no provincial states here. The established religion is the Roman catholic, yet there are a few much oppressed and persecuted protestants in the country. Chris∣tianity was first introduced here by St. Kilian, a Scotsman, about the end of the seventh century; and St. Burchard, the first bishop, was appointed and consecrated by St. Boniface, who is also said to have been a Scotsman, and was the chief apostle of the Germans, and first archbishop of Mentz, to which see the bishop of Wurtzburg is suffragan. The bishop's title runs thus: prince of the holy Roman empire, bishop of Wurtzburg, and duke of East Frankenland. His revenue is said to amount to sixty thousand pounds a year, with which he maintains a considerable body of troops even in time of peace, with a splendid court and houshold, horse and foot guards, &amp;c. being absolute in temporals, and living in all the state of a sovereign temporal prince; but in spirituals an appeal lies from him to his metropolitan, or the pope's nun∣cio. His chapter consists of twenty-two capitular canons, and thirty who are domiciled, who must all be of noble birth, and each has an income of three thousand German crowns per annum. The bishop has the honour of the pallium and cross, with a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle. His assessment to the empire is eight hundred and fifty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar eight hundred and twenty-six rix-dollars. The chief places in the bshopric are,</P>
<P>Wurtzburg, which gives name to it, and is its capital. Wurtzburg, in German, signifies a town of herbs, a great variety of which is found about it. It stands in the very centre of Franconia, on the banks of the Mayne, forty miles west of Bam∣berg, and is well fortified. There is also a strong
<PB N="113" REF="1130"/>
fort near the town, containing an episcopal palace, magazine, and a church; but the palace, in which the bishop usually resides, stands in the town, and is a noble structure, the first stone of which was laid in the year 1720. The cathedral, together with a seminary, is dedicated to St. Kilian, the pa∣tron of Wurzburg and Franconia. As this city is under the dominion of an ecclesiastical prince, the reader need not be told, that it contains a great number of churches, monasteries, nunneries, and other religious foundations. Here also is an uni∣versity founded in 1403, a house of the Teutonic order, and another of the order of St. John, a foundery for cannon and bells, a college of Jesuits, and several hospitals. In the bishop's cellar are said to be more than sixty tuns of curious work∣manship, full of excellent old wine. At the en∣trance of the bridge, over the Mayne, is a triumphal arch of hewn stone. Of the abbies, one, large and magnificent, belongs to Scots Benedictines. The cathedral, an antient Gothic structure, is richly adorned within with statues, altars, pillars, &amp;c. of marble and silver, finely executed, besides paint∣ings, sculptures, gilding, and vessels of gold and silver. Every thing almost is carved and gilt in the church; the pulpit, the organs, the benches for the canons, and the altars. Most of the statues also are gilt. The great hospital of St. Julian here, is one of the richest and most magnificent in Europe, having, it is said, a greater estate and income than the bishop himself. In the castle is a fine train of artillery, with all the implements ne∣cessary for gunners, and vast quantities of mus∣quet-balls, bombs, bullets, flints, besides a year's provision for six thousand men at arms, and forty thousand horse and foot. Several diets have been held in this city, which, like most others, has ex∣perienced many calamities, and a great variety of
<PB N="114" REF="1140"/>
fortune. The wine, called Stein wine, from a mountain near Wurzburg, where it grows, is much esteemed.</P>
<P>Kiszingen, a small town on the Saale, near which are medicinal springs.</P>
<P>Munnerstadt, a small town, which gives name to a hundred, and contains a gymnasium, a com∣mandery of the Teutonic order, and a cloister of Augustine hermits.</P>
<P>Neustadt on the Saale, a small town, giving name to a bailiwic, and containing a Carmelite cloister.</P>
<P>Of the other small towns in this bishopric the chief are,</P>
<P>Heydingsfeld, Karlstadt, Rothenfels, Gemun∣den, Eltman, Haszfurt, Volkach, Dettelbach, Homburg, Ochsenfurt, Kitzengen, Laurungen, Bischofsheim, Fladungen, Malrichstadt, Sulzheim, Gerolzhofen, Upper Schwarzach, Schlusselfeld, Markt-Bibart, Iphofen, Arnsteim, Proselzheim, Schwarzach, Butthard, Aub, Rottingen, Jaxtberg, Lauda, Grunsfeld, Hartheim, Heidenfeld, Rip∣perg, Ochsenfurt. Jaxtberg and Hartheim have castles. In Dittelbach is a Franciscan cloister, and a celebrated image of the Virgin. In Schwarzach is a cloister of Benedictines. In Kitzengen is an Urseline nunnery and Capuchin cloister; but most of the inhabitants are protestants. The Cistercian abbey of Eberach, in this bishopric, is one of the most considerable and richest in Germany. Ko∣nigshofen in the Grabfeld, in Latin Regis Curia in Arvis, is a small, but well fortified town, on the Saale.</P>

<PB N="115" REF="1150"/>
<HEAD>Of the FRANCONIAN PRINCIPALITIES of the MARGRAVES of BRANDENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>These principalities constitute the burgravate of Nuremberg, in which city the antient burgraves had their seat. From these burgraves, as we ob∣served already, in our account of the electorate of Brandenburg, the present royal and princely house of Brandenburg is descended. The burgravate is divided into the two principalities of Anspach and Bayreuth. The margrave of Culmbach was a collateral branch of Bayreuth; but, in the year 1726, on the extinction of the latter, became the reigning line. The title of both lines is the same as that of the king of Prussia, excepting the regal. Among other privileges of the margraves, is that of appointing a judge for the jurisdiction of the bur∣gravate of Nuremburg, which was antiently of great extent, but is now much more confined. The judge sits at Anspach four times a year; but an appeal lies from him to the supreme tribunal of the empire, provided the sum in dispute is above eight hun∣dred guldens or guilders. The principality of Bayreuth lies mostly above the mountains called the Gebirg, and that of Anspach below them. Of the former, that part which lies above the Gebirg, is bounded by the bishopric of Bamberg, the seigniories of Giech, and the Vogtland, the seig∣niory, of Asch, Bohemia, the Upper Palatinate, and the territory of the imperial city of Nuren∣burg. The soil, though mountainous and sandy, is tolerably fertile. A great variety of minerals are found in it, as iron, copper, lead, vitriol, sul∣phur, antimony, marble of all colours, chrystals, fine clay and sealed earth, or terra sigillata; and formerly there were gold and silver mines wrought.
<PB N="116" REF="1160"/>
There are also some medicinal springs. Of the mountains, the Fichtelberg, that is, the Pine mountain, one of the largest and highest in Ger∣many, is covered, in a great measure, with pine, fir, beech, oak, elm, and lime-trees, and contains many cliffs, caves, bogs, morasses, and deserts. Out of it also rise many rivers, as the White and Red Mayne, the Nabe, the Eger, the Roszlau, the Franconian Saale, the Pegnitz, and the Rednitz, besides lesser streams, all abounding in fish. Lu∣theranism is the established religion of this country; but the Calvinists and Roman catholics, in some places, are allowed the exercise of theirs. Besides several Latin schools and gymnasia, there is an university at Erlang. The principal manufactures of the principality are, stockings, hats, porcelain, white and brown earthen ware, and woollen cloth. Here are the usual hereditary officers, and also an order of knighthood, stiled the Order of Sincerity, or, more commonly, of the Red Eagle. The margrave has a seat and voice in the college of princes, at the diets of the empire, and those of the circle. His assessment to the empire is three hundred and twenty-nine florins, monthly, and three hundred and thirty-eight rix-dollars, each term, to the chamber-court. For the government of the principality, and the administration of jus∣tice, here are the usual councils, courts, and offices, besides a feudal court, and several mine-offices. The prince's revenues amount to upwards of five hundred and fifty guldens; but, it is said, might be improved to near double that sum. Besides a small body of regulars, there is a well-disciplined and regulated militia, each bailiwic and town fur∣nishing its proportion. The principal places in this principality are,</P>
<P>Bayreuth, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, containing a magnificent palace, built since
<PB N="117" REF="1170"/>
the year 1753; in which the prince resides, a gym∣nasium, two Lutheran, and one Calvinist church, a Roman catholic chapel, and a mint. The seat of the high colleges is also here. In the neigh∣bourhood is a pretty house, in a wood, called the Hermitage, belonging to the prince.</P>
<P>St. Gorgen-am-See, a town on the lake called the Brandenburgh-Weyher, not far from Bay∣reuth, in which the prince has a noble palace, with fine gardens. Here the marble of the coun∣try is polished, and wrought into all manner of forms. White and brown porcelain also is made here, in the latter of which gold and silver are very ingeniously and durably annealed.</P>
<P>Streitberg, a market-town, containing a castle, near which yellow marble is dug, and giving name to a bailiwic, in which are several remarkable caverns.</P>
<P>Culmbach, which gave name to a distinct mar∣gravate till 1726, when the margrave succeeded to that of Bayreuth. It stands on the White-Mayne, in a beautiful valley. Near it is the strong fortress of Blassenburg, in which are kept the archives of the Brandenburg family; and the village of Himmelkron, where is a magnificent palace, pleasantly situated on the White-Mayne, amidst fine meadows, gardens, fields, and woods.</P>
<P>Hof, a considerable town on the Saale, contain∣ing four churches, a gymnasium, and a woollen manafucture, and gives name to a district, in which a red, grey, and black marble is dug. Among the grey is a sort variegated with red spots, like drops of blood.</P>
<P>Neila, a market-town, where are mines of cop∣per and iron, with quarries of green marble.</P>
<P>Wunsiedel, a considerable town on the river Roszlau, and the Fichtelberg, whose inhabitants
<PB N="118" REF="1180"/>
deal in wrought plate, and dyed woollen and inen stuffs. There were formerly tin-mines near it.</P>
<P>Weissenstadt, an old little town on the Eger, near which was formerly mines of tin and chrystal. A large lake takes its name from it, abounding with delicious carp and perch.</P>
<P>Lechtenberg, a market-town, giving name to a bailiwic, in which is a copper and iron mine, be∣sides several sorts of marble, and medicinal springs.</P>
<P>Golderonach, a small town on the river Cro∣nach, where was formerly a gold mine. Marble of various kinds is found hereabouts.</P>
<P>Erlang, one of the six head-towns, as they are called, of the principality, situate at the conflux of the Rednitz with the Schwabach, and distin∣guished into the old and new. The latter, which is also called Christian-Erlang, having been begun by the margrave Christian Ernest, in 1686, is one of the finest towns in Germany. It lies close to old Erlang, being almost environed with a wall of free-stone, and containing a margravial palace, with a fine garden, an university, and several churches. Some manufactures are also carried on here, especially those of hats and stockings.</P>
<P>Neustadt on the Aisch, one of the head-towns of the principality, containing a margravial palace, and giving name to a bailiwic. There are many other small towns, but not worth mentioning, as they contain nothing particular. Besides this principality, the margraves are possessed of con∣siderable fiefs in the archduchy of Austria, of which some account will be given afterwards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of EICHSTETT.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is bounded by the Upper-Pala∣tinate, Upper-Bavaria, the duchy of Neuburg, the county of Papenheim, and the principality of
<PB N="119" REF="1190"/>
Anspach. It is a fruitful country, about forty miles in length; but the breadth is small in com∣parison, and very unequal. The bishop is a prince of the empire, but suffragan of Mentz, and has a revenue of between nine and ten thousand pounds. His assessment to the empire is two hundred and forty-six florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar two hundred and eighty-four rix-dollars, each term. The chapter consists of fourteen capi∣tulars, and fourteen domiciled, who must be all gentlemen by sixteen descents. There are no land∣states here, and the inhabitants are all Roman ca∣tholics. The bishopric was founded by St. Boni∣face, who made his sister's son Wilibald, afterwards canonized by pope Benedict XIII. first bishop thereof in the year 745. Here are the usual here∣ditary officers, and high colleges. The bishop is perpetual chancellor of the university of Ingolstadt, and lord of several fiefs possessed by princes and counts. The most considerable places in the bishopric are,</P>
<P>Eichstett, or Aichstadt, i. e. the town or city of Oaks, so called from the huge oaks that formerly grew near it. Here, besides an episcopal palace, and cathedral dedicated to our Lady, are several cloisters and churches, with a Jesuits college. A pious, but very lucrative fraud, is practised by the monks of this place. In St. Walburg's church is a rock, or altar, as it is stiled, containing the breast∣bones of the saint, from which, what they call an oil, but which, in reality, is only a vapour, for it neither burns, nor swims upon the surface of water, is said to flow, and force itself thro' the stone twice a-year. This holy oil is put up in small vials for the use of pilgrims, and other devotees, who are assured of its miraculous virtues, and for that rea∣son resort hither in great numbers to purchase some of it, and pay their devotions to the bones
<PB N="120" REF="1200"/>
of the saint. In the cathedral is said to be a pyx of pure gold, in form of a sun, weighing forty marks, and adorned with three hundred and fifty diamonds, fourteen hundred fine pearls, two hundred and fifty rubies, and several other precious stones, the whole valued at sixty thousand guilders. A new costly altar was erected in this church in 1745, in honour of St. Willibald, whose bones, it was pre∣tended, were then found. Near the town stands the strong citadel of St. Willibaldsburg, upon a hill called Will baldsburg, where the bishops used for∣merly to reside, and in which are kept the archives, with an arsenal and library. The town stands upon the Altmuhl, thirty miles south of Nurenberg.</P>
<P>Hirschberg, a castle on a mountain, which now gives name to a bailiwic, as it did formerly to a county.</P>
<P>Abenberg, a small town and citadel, which for∣merly gave name to a county, and title to its counts.</P>
<P>Besides these, are several other small towns, castles, and cloisters, but not worth mentioning, as they contain nothing remarkable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of ANSPACH, ANSBACH, or ONOLZBACH.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies all below the Gebirg, and has the domain of the Teutonic order, and the bishopric of Wurzburg on the west; part of the bishopric of Bamberg on the north and east; and the circle of Swabia on the south: but is so inter∣mixed with other dominions, that it is difficult to give its true dimensions. As to the soil and pro∣duce it excels that of Bayreuth, yielding not only several sorts of grain and fruits, but also wine and tobacco, iron-mines, marble, medicinal springs, and woods. Tho' some parts of it are sandy and mountainous, yet these produce good pasture, in
<PB N="121" REF="1210"/>
which abundance of cattle are both bred and fed. The woods are well stored with game, and the rivers with fish. The chief of the latter are the Rednitz, the Altmuhl, the Jaxt, the Wornetz, and the Tauber. This principality, exclusive of that of Bayreuth, is said to bring in five hundred thousand crowns a-year to its sovereign, one of the most considerable princes of Ger∣many next to the electors, having lately suc∣ceeded to the margravate of Bayreuth. The pre∣dominant religion is Lutheranism; but at Schwa∣bach the Calvinists have the free exercise of theirs. At Ansbach is a gymnasium illustre. The princi∣pal manufactures of the country are tapestry, stock∣ings, cloth, stuffs, gold and silver lace, wire, nee∣dles, porcelain, leather, and mirrors. The reign∣ing margrave has a seat and voice in the college of princes, and at the diets of the empire and circle. His assessment to the empire for this principality is three hundred and twenty-nine florins, monthly; and to the chamber-court, three hundred and thirty-eight rix-dollars, each term. His military establishment is a life-guard of horse, and one re∣giment of foot of seven companies. The princi∣pal places in the principality are,</P>
<P>Onolzbach, Ansbach, or Anspach, which gives name to it, and is its capital, standing on the Un∣der-Retzat, and containing a palace, in which the margraves commonly reside. Here the chief courts, councils, and offices are held. There also is a public library here, with a collection of medals, a mint, a gymnasium illustre, a porcelain manufactory, bar∣racks for some companies of foot, besides two gar∣dens, and a fine orangery and green-house belonging to the prince, and several churches. The town is small, but well-built, and surrounded with walls.</P>
<P>Bruckberg, a beautiful pleasure-house belonging to the margrave, and standing on an eminence.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="1220"/>
Friersdorf, a castle and park belonging to the prince.</P>
<P>Schwabach, a town situated on a river of the same name. Tho' not large, it is very populous, and one of the chief of the principality. A great variety of hard wares in gold, silver, steel, iron, and brass, are manufactured here, together with cloths, stuffs, tapestry, gold and silver lace, stock∣ings, and tobacco.</P>
<P>Wendelstein, a well built market-town on the Schwarzach, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Schwandt, a very antient, large, and well-built market-town, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Kornburg and Cadolzburg, large market-towns, containing castles, and giving name to bailiwics.</P>
<P>Hosmark-Furth, a large, populous town, carry∣ing on a great trade. It stands on the Rednitz, near Nuremberg, to which city a part of it belongs, as well as to Bamberg. A third-part of the inhabi∣tants is said to be Jews.</P>
<P>Roth, a small town, which has a manufacture of stockings. Spanish lace and stuffs, gives name to an upper bailiwic, and contains an imperial asy∣lum for such as have been accidentally guilty of manslaughter.</P>
<P>Gunzenhausen, one of the chief towns of the principality, standing on the Altmuhll, and giving name to an upper bailiwic.</P>
<P>Hohentrudingin, a citadel, which antiently gave title to counts, and name to a seigniory, but now to an upper bailiwic.</P>
<P>Wassertrudingen, a considerable town, with a castle on the Wernitz.</P>
<P>The other towns, which are but small, are Winds∣bach; Heilsbrun, which takes its name from a me∣dicinal spring; Merkendorf; Feuchtwang, former∣ly an imperial city; Crielsheim, lying on the Jaxt, and having a castle; Lautershausen, on the river
<PB N="123" REF="1230"/>
Altmuhl; Creglingen, on the Tauber, and having a castle; Uffenheim, on the Gollach, and con∣taining a princely palace; Maynbernheim, on the river Mayn; Brixenstadt, containing an imperial asylum for such as have been accidentally guilty of manslaughter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the TEUTONIC ORDER in GENE∣RAL, but in particular of the MASTERSHIP of MERGENTHEIM, and the bailiwic of FRANCO∣NIA.</HEAD>
<P>This order was founded in the year 1190 in Pa∣lestine, and the knights were at first called knights of the Virgin Mary, or brothers of the Teutonic house of our Lady of Jerusalem. They must be all Germans, and of true antient nobility. They are to bind themselves by vows to defend the Chris∣tian religion, and the Holy-land, and to protect and assist the poor and the sick. In 1226 and 1228, after they had been obliged to quit Palestine, they obtained a grant of all the lands they should con∣quer from the pagan Prussians; whereupon they subdued all Prussia, Courland, Semigallia, and Livonia, but afterwards lost them all again. The superior of this spiritual order is stiled the grand and Teutonic master, administrator of the grand masterdom in Prussia, master of the Teutonic order in Germany and Italy, and lord of Freu∣denthal and Eulenberg. He is a prince of the empire, and, as such, has a seat and vote in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, paying a matricular assessment of one hundred and twenty-four florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, two hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, each term. Both Roman catholics and protestants may be invested with the order, and the protestant knights are permitted to marry. The estates, which they are possessed of in
<PB N="124" REF="1240"/>
Germany were obtained partly by purchase, and partly by donation, and consist of what is properly called the masterdom of Mergentheim, and twelve bailiwics. The grand-master is chosen by the chap∣ter, consisting of the counsellors and commanders, or commenders, the latter of whom are administra∣tors and judges of the bailiwics and commenderies; but in weighty matters, an appeal lies from them to the grand-master. The counsellors also, and the commenders, are chosen by the chapter, the latter out of the former, and confirmed by the grand∣master. Each of the bailiwics is subdivided into commanderies. In what is called the masterdom, and the greatest part of the bailiwic of Franconia, the grand-master acts as a sovereign prince; but the commanders of all the other bailiwics, except∣ing those of Alsace and Coblenz, who are imme∣diate states of the empire, are treated as subjects of those princes and states in whose dominions they reside. Besides the masterdom of Mergentheim, the following bailiwics belong to the order.</P>
<P>That of Franconia, containing nineteen com∣mandries, lying in the circles of Swabia, Bavaria, Upper and Lower Rhine, Silesia, and Moravia.</P>
<P>That of Alsace and Burgundy, containing fifteen commanderies, lying in the circle of Swabia, Swis∣serland, the Sandgau, and Upper and Lower Al∣sace.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Austria, containing eight com∣manderies, lying in Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, and Carniola.</P>
<P>The bailiwic seated on the Etsch and Gebirg in Tyrol, containing five commanderies.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Coblenz, containing seven com∣manderies, lying, most of them, in the electorate of Triers and Cologn.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Old Biesen, containing thirteen

<P>The bailiwic of Saxony, containing six com∣manderies.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Thuringia, containing three commanderies.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Utrecht, of which we can give no athentic account.</P>
<P>In the masterdom of Mergentheim, and the com∣manderies lying in this circle, the only places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Mergentheim, a small town on the Tauber, which gives name to the masterdom, and near which, in the castle of Neuhaus, the grand and Teutonic master resides. It is also the seat of the regency, and a gymnasium.</P>
<P>Ellingen, a small town, on the Swabian Retzat, where the provincial commendator of the bailiwic of Franconia usually resides.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCELY COUNTY of HENNE∣BERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by the principalities of Coburg and Schwarzenburg to the east; by those of Gotha and Eisenach to the north; by the bishop∣ric of Wurtzburg to the south; and by the bishopric of Fulda, and the landgravate of Hesse to the west. It is about twenty-four miles in length, and near
<PB N="126" REF="1260"/>
as much in breadth. Besides considerable quanti∣ties of grain, it yields also tobacco, medicinal and salt springs, with mines of silver, copper, and iron. The chief river by which it is watered is the Werra, into which several smaller streams fall. The inhabitants are all Lutherans, except at Schmal∣kalden, where the Calvinists have a church. The only manufactures of the county worth mention∣ing are those of arms, hard-ware, and fustians. The present proprietors of it are the elector of Saxony, the duke of Saxe-Weimar, Meinungen, Gotha, Cobourg-Saalfeld, Hilburghausen, and the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. Some of these princes are entitled by it to voices in the diets of the empire and circle, and all of them contribute to the payment of its assessment to the empire and chamber-court. The principal places in the coun∣ty are,</P>
<P>Schleusingen, lying on the little river Schleuz, and belonging, with its bailiwic, and several others, to the elector of Saxony. Here is a castle, in which the princes of Henneberg used sometimes to reside. The town is not large, but has a gym∣nasium in it, belonging in common to all the dukes of Saxony, who have any share in the county, and a commandery of the order of St. John. Not far from it is a medicinal spring called Wilhelmsbrun.</P>
<P>Ilmenau, a small town on the Ilm, belonging to Saxe-Weimar, and containing a mine-office, on account of the copper and silver mines in the neigh∣bourhood, which were formerly more considera∣ble than at present.</P>
<P>Meinungen, a town situated on the river Werra, and giving title to a branch of the house of Saxe-Gotha, who have a palace in it, with a library and cabinet of medals. In this palace also are kept the Henneberg archives, belonging in common to the
<PB N="127" REF="1270"/>
princes of Saxony. In the neighbourhood of the town tobacco is much cultivated.</P>
<P>Henneberg, a village, where formerly stood the castle, from which the county took its name, and in which the antient counts commonly resided.</P>
<P>Salzungen, a small town on the Werra, taking its name from its salt springs, and belonging to Saxe-Meinungen. Near it also is a medicinal spring.</P>
<P>Romhild, a town, giving name to a seigniory, and containing a castle, which, with the town and seigniory, belongs to Saxe-Meinungen.</P>
<P>Schmalkalden, a pretty, large, populous, thri∣ving town, having salt springs, and a citadel near it called Wilhelmsburg. A great trade also is car∣ried on here in iron and steel wares, there being mines of iron in the neighbourhood, and forges in the town, which is famous in history, on ac∣count of the meetings held in it by the protestant princes, concerning the Reformation, and the league concluded by them in 1531. This town, together with several bailiwics and districts, be∣longs to the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCELY COUNTY of SCHWAR∣ZENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county is surrounded by the principality of Anspach, the bishoprics of Bamberg and Wurzburg, and the county of Cassel. It is about sixteen miles in length, but very narrow in proportion. The inhabitants are some Roman catholics, and some Lutherans. The prince has a seat and voice in the college of princes in the diets of the empire and circle, paying an assessment of forty-nine florins to the empire, and the chamber of Wetz∣lar, on account thereof, and the seigniory of Seinsheim. He is possessed of other estates be∣sides

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOHENLOHE.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies between the marquisate of An∣spach and the territory of Swabian-Halle, being upwards of twenty miles in length, and near as much in breadth, and taking its name from the antient family seat of Hohenlohe, which stood not far from the town of Uffenheim, in the principa∣lity of Anspach. The county, in general, is hilly, but has some fertile plains and vallies, with woods and vineyards, medicinal springs, and plenty of game and cattle. At Weiszbach is also a salt-work. The rivers Kocher, Jaxt, Tauber, and Wernitz, by which it is watered, abound with fish, as well as the lakes, ponds, and brooks. Some of the princes of Hohenlohe being Roman catholics, their subjects, who are mostly Lutherans, are grievously harrassed and persecuted, in regard to the exercise of their religion. The house of Hohenlohe is divided into the two capital branches of Neuenstein and Waldenburg; and these again into others, who have all a share of the county, with their respective colleges and officers. Those of the Neuenstein line are counts, but those of the Waldenburg, princes, or princely counts; for both belong to the Franconian college of counts in the diets of the empire and circle. Their assess∣ment to the empire is one hundred and forty-four florins, of which the Waldenburg branch contributes
<PB N="129" REF="1290"/>
fifty-six, and that of Neuenstein eighty-eight. To the chamber of Wetzlar the former is assessed sixty-seven rix-dollars, and the latter, eighty-nine. The right of primogenitureship has not yet been establish∣ed, except in the Langenburg-branch of the Neuen∣stein-line. The principal places in the county are,</P>
<P>Oehrengen, the capital of the county, situated on the rivulet of Oehrn, and containing two palaces, belonging one to the Waldenburg-branch, and the other to that which takes its title from the town, with a gymnasium, and several churches. Here also the common archives of the family are kept.</P>
<P>Bartenstein, a fine palace on a mountain, in which a branch of the family resides, and from which it takes its title.</P>
<P>Sindringen, a small town on the Kocher, con∣taining a castle, and giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Psedelbach, a large market-town, in which is a palace belonging to the prince, who takes his title from it, and is lord of it and two bailiwics be∣sides.</P>
<P>Waldenburg, a small town, which gives title to one of the capital lines.</P>
<P>Schillingsfurst, a palace on a mountain, which is the residence of, and gives title to a branch of the Waldenburg-line. Near it is a large market∣town, called Frankenau, belonging to the same branch.</P>
<P>Neuenstein, a small town, with a castle, which gives title to one of the capital lines.</P>
<P>Langenburg, a town which gives title to a branch of the Neuenstein-line, and contains a pa∣lace, in which they reside.</P>
<P>Ingelfingen, a small town, which gives title to, and is the residence of another branch of the Neu∣enstein-line.</P>
<P>Kirchberg, a small town on the river Jagst,

giving title to the third branch of the Neuenstein line, who have a palace, and reside in it.</P>
<P>Some of the branches of this family have estates out of the county.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of CASTELL.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies between that of Schwartzen∣berg, and the bishopric of Wurtzburg, and west from Bamberg. It is about twenty-seven miles long, and eight where broadest, and belongs to its own counts, divided into the two principal lines of Remlingen, and Rudenhausen, and de∣scended from the antient dukes of Franconia. The county is, for the most part, a fief of Wurtzburg, to which the counts are hereditary cup-bearers. They have two voices in the college of the impe∣rial counts of Franconia, both at the diets of the empire, and those of the circle. Their assessment to the empire and circle is eighteen florins; and to the chamber of Wetzlar eighteen rix-dollars, each term. The oldest of the reigning counts is always administrator of the feodal seigniories of the whole house, and cup-bearer to the bishop of Wurtzburg. The places in the county worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Castell, a village, containing a fine palace, in which one of the collateral lines of the principal Remlingen-line resides, and giving name to a bai∣liwic belonging to the same line. Near the village formerly stood a castle, that gave name to the county, and was the residence of the counts.</P>
<P>Remlingen, a market-town, from which one of the principal lines takes its title.</P>
<P>Rudenhausen, a village, which gives title to the other capital line, and contains a palace be∣longing to them.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of WERTHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on both sides the Mayne, be∣tween the archbishopric of Mentz and the bishop∣ric of Wurtzburg, a part of it terminating also on the county of Erbach. It abounds in corn, wine, pasturage, wild-fowl, and venison. The inhabi∣tants are mostly protestants. A part of the coun∣ty came by marriage to the family of Lowenstein, who derive their pedigree from that of the elector Palatine, and are divided into the two branches of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Virnenburg, and Lowen∣stein-Wertheim-Rochefort: the former of which are protestants and counts; the latter Roman ca∣lics and princes, or princely counts. They take the title of Lowenstein from the county of that name, under the jurisdiction of the duke of Wir∣temberg, of which they are proprietors, besides other seigniories in the empire, Bohemia, and the Netherlands. They have two voices in the Fran∣conian college of counts of the empire, and have also seat and voice among the counts in the diets of the circle. Their assessment to the empire, on account of Wertheim, is sixty-two florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, eighty-six rix-dollars, each term. The rest of this county, be∣sides what is possessed by the counts of Lowenstein, belongs to the bishop of Wurtzburg and the counts of Castell. Places of any note in it are,</P>
<P>Wertheim, which gives name to it, and is its capital, lying at the conflux of the Mayne and Tauber. Here each of the abovementioned branches of the Lowenstein family have a palace. The inhabitants are partly protestants and partly papists; but the magistracy is wholly protestant.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of ERBACH.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the south side of the Mayne, betwixt the Lower-Palatinate and the archbishop∣ric of Mentz, being about twenty-seven miles long, and near twenty broad. Tho' mountainous, it is not unfruitful, producing wine, rye, spelt, wheat, barley, oats, buck-wheat, and great quan∣tities of potatoes, besides mines of iron, quarries of marble and stone, good pasturage in the vallies, and woods on the mountains. A great deal of pot∣ash is made in the county, which is in a manner en∣compassed by the Mayne, the Rhine, and the Neckar. The religion of the inhabitants is Lutheranism. The counts are divided into three branches, name∣ly, those of Erbach-Erbach, Erbach-Sohonberg, and Erbach-Furstenau, being counts of the em∣pire,

<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of NUREMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This city stands on the Regnitz, over which it has several bridges, both of wood and stone, at the bottom of a hill, sixty miles from Augsburg, eighty-seven from Munich, forty-six from Wurtz∣burg, and fifty from Ratisbon; and is thought by some to be the Segodunum, and by others the Castrum Noricum, of the antients. It is large and well built, but not very populous. Its forti∣fications are a double wall, flanked with towers mounting cannon, and a deep ditch. The magi∣strates, and most of the inhabitants, are Lutherans. There are a great many churches and chapels in it. In that of St. Sebald is a brass monument of the saint, and a picture, representing the creation of the world, by the celebrated Albert Durer, who was a native of the town: but the finest church in the town is that of St. Giles. In that of the Holy Ghost are kept most of the jewels of the empire, together with the pretended spear, with which our Saviour's side was pierced, a thorn of his crown, and a piece of the manger wherein he was laid. Here are also a great many hospitals, one in parti∣cular for foundlings, and another for pilgrims, with a gymnasium, an anatomical theatre, a gra∣nary, a fine public library, the old imperial fortress or castle, some remains of the old citadel of the
<PB N="136" REF="1370"/>
burgraves of Nuremberg, several Latin schools, an academy of painting, a well furnished arsenal, a Teutonic house, in which the Roman catholic service is tolerated, and a mint. Mr. Keysler says, there are upwards of five hundred streets in it, about an hundred and forty fountains, sixteen churches, forty-four religious houses, twelve bridges, ten market-places, and twenty-five thou∣sand inhabitants; and that its territory, besides the capital and four other towns, contains above five hundred villages, and about an hundred and sixty mills on the Regnitz. The trade of this city, though upon the decline, is still very great, many of its manufactures being still exported to all parts of the world; among which may be reckoned a great variety of curious toys, in ivory, wood, and metal. This city has also distinguished itself in the arts of painting and engraving; in particular, very fine globes and maps have been, and still are, exe∣cuted here. When the emperor Henry VI, assist∣ed at a tournament in Nuremberg, he raised thirty∣eight burghers to the degree of nobility, the de∣scendants of whom are called patricians, and have the government of the city almost entirely in their hands, the whole council, except the eight masters of companies, who are summoned only on extra∣ordinary occasions, consisting of them. On Easter∣day the council-house, in which are a great many fine pictures, particularly an Adam and Eve, as large as the life, by Albert Durer, and other curiosities, is open, together with the castle, to be viewed by every one who has a mind to it. In the town library, among other rare and curious books and manuscripts, is Luther's Bible, said to have been snatched from amidst the flames of a fire, without receiving any damage. Here is also a Mexican idol of gold, called Fizlipuzli, having a face like that of a cat or monkey, and a tail like
<PB N="137" REF="1380"/>
that of the former, with a pearl in each ear, and a mirror on its back, in which all its votaries were to look. Among the fine brass cannon in the ar∣senal, is one that is charged at the breech, and may be fired eight times in a minute; and two that carry balls of eighty pounds. The city keeps, in constant pay, seven companies, consisting each, in time of peace, of a hundred men, but, in time of war, of a hundred and eighty-five; two troops of cuirassiers, each consisting of eighty-five men, and two companies of invalids. There are also twenty∣four companies of burghers, well armed and dis∣ciplined. On the new bridge, which is said to have cost a hundred thousand guilders, are two pyra∣mids, on the top of one of which is a dove, with an olive branch in her bill, and on the other an imperial black eagle. The town cellar is so large, that a coach and six may turn round in it. At the academy of painting, men are often hired to stand naked, that the painters and statuaries may draw and model by them from the life. The com∣mon people here have a custom of decking the graves of their relations, with garlands of flowers, on St. John's day. There are a great many curious collections of rarities in this city. In one of these, belonging to a private family, is kept some unde∣cayed rye and wheat, that was laid up in the city granary in the year 1347, and, in another, is a bowl cut out of a rhinoceros's horn. In Leather-street is the intire petrefied trunk of a tree, standing, with its roots, in the earth. Music also flourishes greatly in Nuremberg; and those who delight in mecha∣nic arts and manufactures, cannot any where bet∣ter gratify their curiosity. As an imperial city, it has a seat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle, paying to a Roman month one seventh part of the common imposts of the circle, and to the chamber of Wetzlar eight hundred and
<PB N="138" REF="1390"/>
twelve rix-dollars, each term. The territory be∣longing to the city is pretty large, containing, be∣sides two considerable forests of pine, called the Sibald and Laurence forests, several towns and vil∣lages. Of the former that of Altorf alone is worth mentioning. In it is a citadel, consisting of twelve large courts, and an university, to which belongs an anatomical theatre, a chymical labora∣tory, a botanical garden, an observatory, and a valuable library. The town, though small, is antient, being mentioned in records so early as the year 912.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of SWABIA.</HEAD>
<P>SWABIA is bounded on the north by the Pa∣latinate and Franconia; on the south by Ty∣rol and Swisserland; on the west by Alsace; and on the east by Bavaria. From the two last coun∣tries it is separated by the Rhine and Lech, and from Swisserland, by the lake called the Bodensee, or lake of Constance and Bregenz, which is about forty miles in length. That end of the lake which lies towards Swabia, being parted into two branches by a long slip of land, one of them, viz. that next Ger∣many, is called the Upper-Lake, or the Bodmer, or Ueberlinger-see, and, in Latin, Lacus Acronius; and the other, or that next Swisserland, the Under or Zeller-see, in Latin, Lacus Venetus, or Inferior. In the former is the island of Meinau, and in the other that of Reichenau. In Swabia are two ridges of high mountains, called the Alb or Alp, and the Schwarzwald, or Black Forest. They tra∣verse the greatest part of the circle, from south to north, and from east to west, and most of the rivers, which, after watering the country, fall into the Rhine or Danube, issue from them. A great part of both is covered with woods, which, on the former, consist mostly of beech, and on the latter of fir. The inhabitants of both subsist chiefly by the breeding and sale of sheep and cattle, wood and pitch. Swabia is distinguished into Upper and Lower, Austrian and Imperial, deriving its name from the Suevi, the antient inhabitants of the country, who are said to have had their own from the custom of plaiting their long hair, like a train, in German Schweiss; a custom, as we are told, still ob∣served by the modern Swabians, men, women,
<PB N="141" REF="1420"/>
and children. Under the Franks the country was governed by dukes. At last the emperor Henry IV. conferred it hereditarily on Frederic of Hohen∣staufen, his son-in-law, in whose family it continued till its extinction in 1268. After that, the stewards appointed by the emperor, and their deputies, with the lords, bishops, barons, and the chief cities of the country, by grant, mortgage, or sale, and other methods, by degrees, became sovereigns of different parts of it, as it happened in the rest of the empire. The circle of Swabia, containing the great∣est part of the country of that name, extends above a hundred miles from east to west, and about a hun∣dred from south to north, and is bounded by the cir∣cle of the Upper-Rhine, Franconia, Bavaria, Au∣stria, and Swisserland. The summoning princes are, the bishop of Constance, and the duke of Wur∣temberg; but the latter is sole director. The diets are commonly held twice a year at Ulm. The states are divided into five benches, viz. that of the ecclesiastical princes and abbots, that of the temporal princes and abbots; that of the prelates; that of the counts and barons; and, lastly, that of the free imperial cities, of all which we shall treat in the order of their rank, and precedence, at the diet. As to its quotas of men and money to the taxes of the empire, they have been reduced to an equality with those of the circles of Upper and Lower-Saxony, the Lower-Rhine, and Westphalia, of which some account hath been given. The troops of the circle consist of several regiments of foot and horse. As to religion it is one of the mixed, and on that account nominates two assessors of the imperial chamber, the one a Catholic and the other a Lutheran. The air is healthy, and the soil, especially in the lower parts of it, fruitful. The principal manufacture is linen cloth. Of the
<PB N="142" REF="1430"/>
rivers, the most considerable are the Danube, Neckar, and Rhine.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular description of the several countries and states contained in the circle.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of CONSTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric, or at least such part of it as be∣longs to this circle, lies in Upper Swabia, on both sides of the Bodensee, or lake of Constance. It derives its name from the city so called, which shall be described afterwards, and to which the see was removed from Windisch in Swisserland in the sixth century, as is generally supposed; but tho' the cathedral is in Constance, the bishop has very little power there, and resides at Mersburg on the other side the lake. The chapter consists of twenty canons and four expectants. The diocese was formerly very extensive, comprehending the greatest part of Swabia and Swisserland; but the protestant religion now prevails in many parts of it. The bishop is a prince of the empire, and, as such, has seat and vote in the diets of the empire and circle, paying for all his estates therein to a Roman month one hundred and sixteen florins, and to the imperial chamber one hundred and twenty rix-dollars. He has his hereditary officers, namely, a marshal, chamberlain, cup-bearer and steward; and also his high colleges. His revenue, arising from his demesnes, is said to amount only to about twenty thousand florins. As bishop he is subordinate to the archbishop of Mentz. The principal places belonging to him in this circle are,</P>
<P>Mersburg, or Morspurg, a very pretty town on the Bodensee, eight miles north-east of Constance, and the residence of the bishop. The depth of the lake, opposite the town, is one hundred and eight
<PB N="143" REF="1440"/>
fathom; but the upper lake, in some places, is said to be three hundred and fifty fathoms deep. In its neighbourhood are many vineyards.</P>
<P>Reichenau, in Latin, Augia Dives, a Benedictine abbey, on the island of that name, in the Zeller∣see. The abbot, before it was united to the bi∣shopric, was a prince of the empire; but the bishop is now abbot, and stiles himself lord of Reichenau, though he has no seat on account of it in the diets of the circle, as the abbot had. The emperor, Charles the Fat, lies buried in the convent, which is said to be possessed of an emerald of an extraor∣dinary size, being two inches thick, and weighing twenty-eight pounds three quarters, the gift of the aforesaid emperor, or, as others affirm, of Char∣lemagne. The island is very pleasant and fertile, especially in wine.</P>
<P>Oehningen, a convent near Stein, of which the bishop of Constance is prior, and of which he stiles himself lord. Both this opulent abbey, and that of Reichenau, were annexed to the bishopric, to ballance the loss it had suffered by the reformation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of AUGSBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric takes its name from the imperial city of Augsburg, where it was founded. That part of it which lies towards Tyrol, is very moun∣tainous, but that which lies on the Lech, is fertile in corn and pasture. The bishop is a prince of the empire, and suffragan to the archbishop of Mentz. He pays the usual assessments to the empire, and chamber of Wetzlar, and has his hereditary offi∣cers, and high colleges. The cathedral is in the city of Augsburg, where the chapter, consisting of forty persons, resides, but the bishop in the town of Dillengen. His revenue is said to amount to one
<PB N="$44" REF="1450"/>
hundred thousand rix-dollars, and that of the canons, one year with another, to about twelve or fourteen thousand guilders, each. The only place in the bishopric worth mentioning is,</P>
<P>Dillengen, where the bishop resides. It stands on the Danube, contains an university and several re∣ligious houses, and had formerly counts of its own. The diocese extends much farther than the tempo∣ral jurisdiction of the bishop, reaching eastward, to those of Ratisbon and Freysingen; southward to those of Brixen and Chur; westward to that of Constance; and northward to those of Eischstatt and Wurtzburg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCELY PRIORY of EWANGEN.</HEAD>
<P>The lands belonging to this priory lie on the frontier of the circle of Franconia, being surround∣ed by the county of Oettingen and Limburg, the duchy of Wurtemburg, and the marquisate of Brandenburg Anspach. The prior is a prince of the empire, and, as such, has seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, paying, for his ma∣tricular assessment, eighty florins; and to the im∣perial chamber one hundred and seventy-five rix-dollars. His chapter consists of twelve persons. The priory has its hereditary officers, and the duke of Wirtemberg is its protector. The only place in its territory worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Ewangen, a little town on the river Jagst, or Jaxt, where the prior and chapter have their re∣sidence, the former stiling himself lord of it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCELY ABBEY of KEMPTEN.</HEAD>
<P>This abbey lies in the imperial town of Kemp∣ten, and its lands on both sides the river Iler, con∣sisting
<PB N="145" REF="1460"/>
chiefly of the princely county of Kempten. The abbot is a prince of the empire, and, as such, has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, paying, for his matricular assessment, one hun∣dred and fifty-two florins, in lieu of six horse and twenty foot; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, one hundred and eighty-two dollars. He is chosen by the chapter, consisting of twenty nobles, has his hereditary officers and high colleges, and is grand∣marshal to the empress. He is also exempt from all episcopal jurisdiction, and subject only to the pope in spirituals, by virtue of a grant from all Adrian I. He was lord of the imperial city and territory of Kempten, till 1525, when the inha∣bitants purchased their liberty of him. In the town, however, there is still a palace, with its offices, belonging to him, besides the abbey church, and some private houses. The only place in the abbey lands worth mentioning, is</P>
<P>Gronenbach, a considerable market-town, having a protestant church in it, and a convent near it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUCHY of WURTEMBURG and TECK.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the north, by part of Franconia, the archbishopric of Mentz, and the palatinate of the Rhine; on the east, by the coun∣ty of Oettingen, the marquisate of Burgau, the territory of Ulm, the bishopric of Augsburg, and several other petty states of Swabia; on the south by the Danube, the principalities of Hohenzollern, and Furstenberg, and the marquisate of Hohen∣berg; and, on the west, by part of the palatinate of the Rhine, the marquisate of Baden, and the Black-forest. It reaches betwixt sixty and seventy miles from east to west, and from south to north; being the most considerable dominion in Swabia, not only in respect of extent, but of fertility and
<PB N="146" REF="1470"/>
populousness. One division of it is into the Unter, or Under-land, the Middle-land, and the Upper∣land; the last of which makes a part of the mountainous tract called the Alb, and Black∣forest. It is also divided into the land above and below the Steig, which is the name of a a ridge of mountains near Stuttgard. This duchy not only abounds in grain of most sorts, but also in flax, hemp, and good wine, commonly called Neckar wine, and fruit, especially pears and ap∣ples; insomuch that cyder and perry are the com∣mon drink of the peasants, when wine happens to be dear. In this country are also mines of silver, copper, and iron, woods of fir, oak, beech, birch, and pine, some salt-springs, abundance of sheep, game, and cattle, coal, and turf, cobalt, sulphur, terra sigillata, fine clays for porcelain, and earthen ware, several sorts of marble, black amber, ala∣baster, millstones, mineral springs, and baths. Silk is also cultivated in it. It is well watered by the Neckar, the Enz, Nagold, Fils, and Rems. The number of the inhabitants amounts to near five hundred thousand; that of the cities and towns to sixty-eight; and that of the boroughs, market∣towns, and villages, to about twelve thousand. On important occasions, diets are called and held at Stutt∣gard, consisting of the Lutheran prelates and abbots, and the representatives of the towns. The esta∣blished religion is Lutheranism; and the dukes, who are now Roman catholics, have engaged not to attempt any innovations in point of religion, but to suffer every thing to remain on its former footing. Before the Reformation there were about a dozen very rich convents in this country, whose revenues are now chiefly applied to the mainte∣nance of churches, schools, and the clergy. Be∣sides Lutherans, here are some Calvinists, Wal∣denses, and Jews. The Waldenses are allowed the public exercise of their religion, but the others
<PB N="147" REF="1480"/>
only in private. The Lutheran clergy are under four general and thirty-eight special superinten∣dents. For the instruction of youth, there are above fifty grammar schools in the duchy, be∣sides a gymnasium at Stuttgard, and an univer∣sity at Tubingen. For a supply of able divines, and schoolmasters, here are excellent regulations; for the schools are not only regularly visited and examined, but the more promising youths are car∣ried successively, at the public expence, from the schools to the gymnasium; from the gymna∣sium to the country convents or academies; and from these to the university of Tubingen, where they are maintained till they are provided for, either as schoolmasters, or ministers, after having under∣gone severe examinations in their progress from one seminary to another. Hence this country is said to have such able and exemplary divines, as are hard∣ly to be found in any other protestant country. It is certain, however, that these divines discovered a very selfish, mercenary, uncharitable spirit, or a very narrow, blind, bigotted zeal, in opposing the reception of the French refugees, after the revo∣cation of the edict of Nantz, and giving out, to their shame and dishonour, that it was better to admit Mahometanism than Calvinism, tho' the latter differs in no material point from Lutheranism. The principal manufactures of this country are, earthen-ware, porcelain, glass-ware, especially mir∣rours, paper, linen cloth, woollen stuffs, hats, stock∣ings, printed cottons, and silks. At Calwe and Urach are trading companies, which are of great service to the country, especially that of the former. The princes of Wurtemburg had long only the title of counts. That of duke was first conferred on Eber∣hard I. in the year 1495, by the emperor Maxi∣milian. The right of primogenitureship was esta∣blished in the family so early as in the year 1473.
<PB N="148" REF="1490"/>
There is a branch of it settled in Silesia, which, from the duchy of Oels, has the title of duke of Wurtemburg Oels. The duke's title at present is, duke of Wurtemburg and Teck, count of Mompelgard, lord of Heydenheim and Justingen. He is hereditary standard bearer of the empire, and grand-huntsman; in allusion to the last of which the order of hunting was founded here in 1702. The ensign of that order is a gold-cross, enamelled red, appended to a broad watered scarlet rib∣bon, passing from the left-shoulder to the right∣side. On the left breast of the coat is a silver star, embroidered, round which is the motto of the order, Amicitiae virtutis{que} faedus. Their grand fes∣tival is on St. Hubert's day. As a prince of the empire, the duke has seat and voice in the college of princes at the diets, paying the usual assess∣ments to the empire and imperial chamber. We have already observed, that he is summoning prince and director of this circle. Causes are de∣termined here in the last resort; no appeal lying from the court-judicature to the aulic-council, or any foreign tribunal. The revenues of the duchy are said to amount to two millions of guilders per annum; and the troops, in time of peace, to four thousand men, including the contingent of the circle, which is eighteen hundred. The duke has a great number of hunting seats. So numerous are the deer and wild boars, that Mr. Keysler says above twenty thousand head perished in the win∣ters of 1731 and 1732, by the severity of the wea∣ther; and no wonder they multiply fast, as no per∣son, on pain of death, dare offer to wound or kill them, unless at the duke's hunting matches; so that the poor peasants, near the forests, are obliged in summer to keep a constant look out, and to be con∣tinually watching their flocks and corn-fields. A very antient custom prevails thro' the whole duchy
<PB N="149" REF="1500"/>
of decorating their apartments with the horns of deer. The principal places therein are,</P>
<P>Stuttgart, or Stuttgardt, the capital and resi∣dence of the duke, delightfully situated on the Ni∣senbach, which, at the distance of four or five miles, falls into the Neckar. A new ducal pa∣lace was begun here in 1746. Near the old pa∣lace are the menagerie and summer house, the latter of which is greatly admired for its architec∣ture. This city was once the see of a bishop, and the church of the Holy Cross is still stiled the ca∣thedral. Here the duke's high colleges are held. Some derive the name of the town from its being antiently a stud for breeding horses; which seems the more probable, as its arms are a colt. There are some natural hot baths near it, which are much frequented. The duke has a good collection of antiquities and rarities; among which is a Jupiter Dolichenus, being a representation of that deity in armour, standing on the crupper of an ox, and the picture of a woman, who had a long beard, when she was only twenty five years old. Here is a theatre for French comedies, an arsenal, and a considerable silk manufacture. The town is not large, nor well built, most of the houses being low, and of wood; and the streets, tho' pretty broad and open, are dirty.</P>
<P>Cantstadt, a small town on the Neckar, in and near which are several salt springs, and an excel∣lent mineral spring. Near it also in a hill are found great quantities of bones, of both great and small animals. In the town is a cotton printing house; and, in a village hard by, a silk manufacture. At no great distance is the antient family seat of Wurtemburg, which gave name to the duchy, and in the neighbourhood of which, the antient counts held their courts in the open air.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="1510"/>
Waiblingen, a little town on the Rems, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Schorndorf, a small, but well fortified town, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Beutelspach, a borough, where the cathedral antiently stood, and the counts resided. It gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Leonberg, a little town, containing a ducal pa∣lace, and giving name to a district, in which is Heimsheim, a small, but antient town.</P>
<P>Coppingen, a town on the river Fils, contain∣ing a ducal palace, with a silk manufactory, and giving name to a district. In its neighbourhood is an excellent mineral spring.</P>
<P>Urach, a little town on the Alb, near the river Erms, which contains a ducal seat, with a linen manufactory, and formerly gave name to a coun∣ty. In its neighbourhood are mills for lead, iron, and paper; and in the district to which it gives name, some fine studs of horses, with a beautiful white earth; and that called the Holzrutsehe, which is a large iron pipe, into which the wood felled on the Alb being put, is conveyed, in an instant, from the top of a mountain into the river Erms, and by that into the Neckar, which brings it to Berg near Stuttgard. Upwards of nine thou∣sand cords of wood are thus yearly conveyed to that town.</P>
<P>Munsingen, a small town, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Nurlingen, a small town on the Neckar, which gives name to a bailiwic, and has a well-endowed hospital.</P>
<P>Upper-Ensingen, a village noted for fine mill∣stones.</P>
<P>Backnang, a town on the Murr, giving name to a bailiwic. Not far from it are the curious glass∣works of Spiegelberg.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="1520"/>
Marpach, a small town on the river Neckar, giving name to a district, which produces excel∣lent wine, and in which an antient town, called Veneria, or Sicca-Veneria, is said to have stood.</P>
<P>Beilstein, a small town, which gives name to a district, and had formerly counts of its own. In the district is a nunnery of Lutheran ladies.</P>
<P>Neuffen, a small town, which had antiently lords of its own, and gives name to a bailiwic. Near it is a castle.</P>
<P>Calwe, a town on the Nagold, in which is a cloth manufacture, and a trading company, and which had antiently counts of its own. It now gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Wildbad, a little town, famous for its warm baths.</P>
<P>Neuenburg, a small town, having a castle near it, and giving name to a bailiwic. Great quanti∣ties of those iron-stones, commonly called blood∣stones, or glass-heads, are found near it.</P>
<P>Brankenheim and Winnenden, small towns, giving name to districts.</P>
<P>Dornstetten, a town in the Black-forest, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Guglingen, a small town on the Zaber, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Marggroningen, a town on the river Glems, in the district of Groningen, which was once im∣perial.</P>
<P>In the same district is Oszweil, a village, in which the duke enjoys what is called the wild-fang, i. e. a right of taking up, and making slaves of all vagrants.</P>
<P>Vayhingen, a town on the Enz, containing a castle, and giving name to a bailiwic, which was formerly a county. In the bailiwic is a quarry of transparent alabaster.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="1530"/>
Tubingen, the second town of the duchy, lying on the Neckar, and having a castle near it on a hill. Here is held the high court, in which all causes are determined in the last resort. At this place also is an university, a seminary of divines, with a collegium illustre, the students of which must be all princes or counts, a Latin school, and a woollen manufacture. In the neighbourhood is a medicinal Bath.</P>
<P>Herrenburg, a considerable town, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Ludwigsburg, one of the chief towns in the duchy, in which is a ducal palace, or castle, with fine gardens, a green-house, and menagerie, and manufactures of cloth, linen, and marbled paper.</P>
<P>This town is the usual summer residence of the ducal court.</P>
<P>The other small towns in the duchy are, Bob∣lingen, Sindelsingen, Heubach, Lauffen on the Neckar, over which it has a long wide bridge, and a castle on a rock in the middle of it; Great-Bol∣war; Tuttlingen, or Duttlingen, in the district belonging to which is an iron manufactory; Dora∣han; Nagold, on the river of the same name, near which is a medicinal spring; Ebingen; Horn∣berg; Schittach, near which is a copper and silver mine work, and a fine clay for making porcelain; Kirchheim under Teck, so called from its situa∣tion below the old castle of Teck, from which the antient dukes of Teck took their title. In the hill, on which the castle stands, is found the ga∣gates or black amber, which has all the qualities of the yellow, the fragrancy excepted; Owen; Weilheim; Murhard, famous formerly for its abbey, now secularized; Bahlingen; Bietigheim; Wild∣berg; Blaubeuren; Sulz, where are two salt-springs, and in its district some iron works; Pfullingen, in the district belonging to which are fine orchards, a
<PB N="153" REF="1540"/>

<P>There are some fiefs and estates belonging to the house of Wurtemburg without the duchy. Among the former, in particular, is the county of Lowes∣tein, of which the princes and counts of Lowes∣tein-Wertham are proprietors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The MARGRAVATE of BAADEN.</HEAD>
<P>This country, which is one of the best in Ger∣many, lies along the eastern banks of the Rhine. It is divided between two princes of the same fa∣mily, who take their titles from the names of the capital towns of their respective shares, the one being stiled the margrave of Baaden-Baaden, and the other of Baaden-Dourlach. The share of the former, as lying south of the other, is distinguished by the name of the Upper; and that of the latter
<PB N="154" REF="1550"/>
by the name of the Lower Margravate, or mar∣quisate. The right of primogenitureship hath been long introduced into both these branches. The whole country is said to be near sixty miles long, and twenty broad, and lies between the duchy of Wurtemberg and the Brisgau. It is fruitful in corn, wine, hemp, flax, and wood, abounding in particular with chesnut-trees. There are also many quarries of marble and free-stone in it, large herds of swine, plenty of fish, fowl, and venison, and the baths and mineral springs are so common, that the chief towns of both marquisates have their names from them. Both princes exercise an absolute au∣thority in their dominions, excepting so far as it is limited by the laws of the empire, and lay taxes on their subjects without assembling any states. The Upper Margravate, or that of Baaden-Baa∣den, is bounded by the Rhine, the Lower Mar∣gravate, the duchy of Wurtemberg, the county of Eberstein, and the Ortenau. Other estates be∣longing to the margrave are the lordship of Mahl∣berg, lying between the Ortenau and Brisgau, the county of Eberstein, a considerable part of the county of Sponheim, two manors in the lordship of Graffenstein, and one in the duchy of Luxem∣burg, with several baronies in Bohemia. He has a vote in the college of princes, both in the diets of the empire and circle. His matricular assess∣ment is twelve horsemen and twenty foot, or two hundred and sixty-four florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, one hundred and seventy-four rix-dollars. His annual revenue is said to amount to four hundred thousand florins. As to religion, both the margrave and his subjects are Roman ca∣tholics. The following are the principal places in the country.</P>
<P>Rastadt, where the prince resides in a magnifi∣cent castle, in which were settled the preliminaries
<PB N="155" REF="1560"/>
of the peace, concluded at Baden betwixt the em∣peror and France, in 1714. The town, which is not large, and belonged formerly to the counts of Eberstein, stands in a fine plain on the rive. Murg, which a little below falls into the Rhine. Not far from it is a palace of the margrave's, called the Favorita.</P>
<P>Baaden, which derives its name from its hot baths, said to be impregnated with salt, alum, and sulphur, and to give relief in the cramp, gout, and other nervous distempers. The town is plea∣santly situated among vineyards, and contains a palace of the margrave's.</P>
<P>Steinbach, a small town, giving name to a di∣strict.</P>
<P>Stollhoffen, a little town situate not far from the Rhine, five miles south-west of Baaden, and fa∣mous for the lines cast up here in the war for the Spanish succession, to guard the empire against the French, who were repulsed, when they attacked them in 1703; but in 1707 they forced them, and raised vast contributions in the adjacent coun∣try. Near the town is a Benedictine abbey.</P>
<P>Beinheim, a little town in Lower Alsace, be∣longing, with the district, to the margrave.</P>
<P>Kehl, a village, of which only a part belongs to the margrave. It gives name to a district, con∣taining the noted fortress, called, from the village, fort Kehl. The fort so called, first stood at the east end of the bridge over the Rhine, at Strasburg, but was afterwards built at the conflux of the Kin∣zig and Rhine, and is now in a ruinous condition.</P>
<P>Mahlberg, a little town, containing a convent of Capuchins, and giving name to a lordship.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="156" REF="1570"/>
<HEAD>The LOWER MARGRAVATE, or that of BAADEN-DOURLACH.</HEAD>
<P>This margravate is bounded by that of Baaden-Baaden, the duchy of Wurtemberg, the Rhine, the Lower Palatinate, and the bishopric of Spire. The marquisate of Hochberg lying in the Brisgau, the lordships of Roteln, Sausenberg, and Baaden-Weiler, lying betwixt the Rhine and the Brisgau, belong also to the margrave, who has two votes in the college of princes in the diets of the empire and circle. His matricular assessment is three hundred and two florins, and to the cham∣ber of Wetzlar one hundred and seventy-four rix-dollars. As to religion, this branch of the family, together with the greater part of their subjects, are Lutherans, the Calvinists, Roman catholics, and Jews, being tolerated only in some towns. The revenue of this is much the same as that of the other marquisate, or about four hundred thousand florins; and the principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Karlsruhe, that is, Charles Rest, a town and palace begun in 1715 by the margrave Charles-William. From the turret, on the palace, is a prospect not only of the chief streets of the town, but of twenty-five walks or vistas, some planted, and others cut thro' the neighbouring woods. Here is also a gymnasium, a synagogue, and churches for the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Catholics. In the garden of the palace, according to Keisler, are upwards of four thousand orange, lemon, and bay trees, with an aviary, and a decoy, in the last of which are two thousand wild ducks.</P>
<P>Muhlburg, a small town in the district of Karls∣ruhe.</P>
<P>Dourlach, the capital of the principality, situate on the river Pfinz, twenty-one miles north-east
<PB N="157" REF="1580"/>
from Baaden. It gives name both to the principa∣lity and a district, part of which is very fruitful in corn, hemp, flax, and wine.</P>
<P>Gretzingen, a village on the Pfinz, where the margrave has a fine palace and gardens.</P>
<P>Pforzheim, a town situate at the conflux of the Entz, Nagold, and Wurm, and giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Hochberg, a very antient castle, giving name to a lordship, in which are Emmendingen and Sulzburg, small towns.</P>
<P>Roteln, a ruined castle, which gives name to a lordship, containing Larrach and Schopfen, small towns.</P>
<P>Sausenberg, another antient castle, which gives name to a landgravate or lordship.</P>
<P>Baden weiler, a castle on a mountain, giving name to a lordship.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The TERRITORIES belonging to the PRINCE of HOHENZOLLERN.</HEAD>
<P>These territories, consisting of the county of Hohenzollern, the county of Sigmaringen, and the lordship of Haigerloch, are almost entirely surrounded by the duchy of Wurtemburg, the principality of Furstenberg, and the county of Hohenburg, being about thirty-four miles long, and ten where broadest. They are tolerably fer∣tile, being watered by the Danube, the Eyach, and Starzell, which fall into the Neckar. The princes are divided into the two lines of Hohenzollern-Hechin∣gen, and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. They are hereditary chamberlains of the holy Roman em∣pire, their pedigree the same as that of the house of Brandenburg, and both branches Roman ca∣tholics. They have but one vote in the diet of the empire, but two in those of the circle, paying
<PB N="158" REF="1590"/>
each an assessment to the chamber of Wetzlar, but Hechingen only to the empire. The revenue of both branches is said to amount to about thirty the find florins. The only places in their territo∣ries worth mentioning are,</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CITY of AUGSBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city, called antiently Vindelica, and Augusta Vindelicorum, or Rhaetorum, from a colony planted here by Augustus Caesar, stands near the conflux of the Lech and Wertach, on the confines of Bavaria, in a pleasant fertile coun∣try, about twenty-five miles from the Danube, be∣ing the metropolis of Swabia, and one of the largest and finest cities in Germany. It is well fortified, has four large, and six small gates, with a great many monasteries, nunneries, and churches, be∣sides the cathedral. Of the churches, some be∣long to the Roman catholics, and some to the Lu∣therans; for here both religions are tolerated, and both have a share in the government. In this city, in 1518, Luther appeared before the diet, to an∣swer for his new doctrine; and twelve years after, he and Melancthon presented their confession of faith to the emperor Charles V. whence the Lu∣therans are said to be of the Augsburg confession,
<PB N="178" REF="1790"/>
tho' their present creed differs widely from that confession. Besides the abovementioned public buildings, here is the finest town-house in all Ger∣many, a great many hospitals well endowed, a Lutheran gymnasium, an academy for arts and sciences, founded in the year 1755, and called the Imperial Franciscan academy, two well furnished armouries, a house of correction, and a work-house, with several beautiful fountains and reservoirs, whence the city is well supplied with water, brought by aqueducts from the Lech to five towers, and from thence, by means of curious water-works, distributed through the whole city. There are several corn, sawing, flatting, and smelting∣mills, on the aqueducts. The palaces of the counts of Fuggar are very magnificent. To these counts belong a great number of small houses in the su∣burbs, called the Fuggery, which are let at a very low rent to poor burghers, and others. The trade of the city, though still considerable, is far short of what it was formerly. At present, exclu∣sive of the bank commerce, and the Tyrol wines, with which it supplies almost all Germany, it consists chiefly in gold and silver-smiths wares, and those of tin; and ivory, clocks, and toys. The government of the city is almost entirely in the hands of the pa∣tricians. The bishop, however, has certain powers and prerogatives in it. The revenue of the city is very considerable, and its garrison consists of three hundred men. In the council-house are some very noble halls, which, with the other apartments, are adorned with fine pictures, sculptures, statues, gilding, &amp;c. Of the fountains, the most beauti∣ful are those of Augustus and Hercules. Betwixt the gates of Gogging and Klenker, is a very curi∣ous wicket for admitting proper persons in the night-time. In the cathedral are fourteen chapels, and the arms of all the countries possessed by
<PB N="179" REF="1800"/>
Charles V. who here laid up his sword, standard, sceptre, and crown, when he bid adieu to this world, and retired to a convent. The abovemen∣tioned wicket is so wonderful a contrivance, that certain engineers and architects, who were sent by the magistrates of Nuremberg to examine it, with a view to have such another made there, declared, that without pulling down the walls, and all the ma∣ry, it was not in the power of the devil himself to find out how it was contrived, or to make one like it in a thousand years. In the library belonging to the gymnasium, are some curious books and manu∣scripts. The abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Ulrichand Afra in this city, has a seat among the prelates of the Rhine, and pays the usual taxes to the empire. The revenue of the abbey is com∣puted at above fifty thousand crowns. It is said to be a privileged place for debtors and criminals for three days, but no longer, without the abbot's permission. In the convent of the Carmelites is a remarkable sun-dial, being a Madona, whose hand holds a sceptre, marking the hours, and whose head is enriched with rays, stars, and all the signs of the zodiac. The public granaries of this city contain great quantities of corn. In one of the ar∣senals is an old battering ram of brass, still pre∣served entire. All orders and degrees of persons here are distinguished by their proper dresses, some of which are very odd and uncommon: prints of them all, done on paste-board, are sold in the town. The hospital of the Holy Ghost is a very noble one, and patients of both religions are admitted into it. The inn, called the Three Kings, is said to be the most superb in Europe. Neither Jews nor Calvi∣nists have a toleration for their worship here. As an imperial city, Augsburg has seat and vote in the diets of empire and circle, paying a matricular
<PB N="180" REF="1810"/>
assessment of five hundred and seven rix-dollars. The territories belonging to it are considerable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ULM.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city, which is said to have derived its name from the groves of elms near it, stands on the Danube, forty-seven miles east of Augsburg, and is pretty well fortified. Its inhabitants are partly Roman catholics and partly Lutherans; but the latter are much more numerous than the former. The magistracy also is Lutheran, and the better half of the members patricians. Here is a Lutheran gymnasium, a Teutonic house, a noble foundation for the daughters of patricians, who are permitted to marry, a handsome town-house, arse∣nal, and cathedral. The last now belongs to the Lutherans, and by some is reckoned the finest in Germany. One of the windows is finely painted with all the lineal descendants of Abraham, down to Jesus Christ. The pipes of the great organ are said to amount to six thousand in number. This town gave birth to the celebrated Freinshemius, so well known to, and so much respected by, the learn∣ed world. It is not near so big as Augsburg, but more populous, and has an extensive territory, consisting of upwards of twenty bailiwics. The bridge over the Danube, consisting of four arches of stone, is strongly fortified, as well as the town; but the latter is so situated, that it could not sustain a long siege. Here are manufactures of iron, linen, woollen, and cotton, stuffs, and fustians, in which, and dressed leather, clock-work, Rhenish, Neckar, and other wines, a great trade is carried on. The garrison, consisting of six companies, are lodged in little houses, or barracks, like that of Augsburg. The archives of all the free cities of Swabia are kept here, and from hence a boat goes weekly to
<PB N="181" REF="1820"/>
Vienna, which carries passengers at the rate of a penny for every four miles, Mr. Polnitz says, the women and burghers of this city and Nuremberg are so oddly dressed, that to see them go and come from church was as diverting as seeing a masque∣rade. The matricular assessment of Ulm is up∣wards of seven hundred florins, and that to the chamber of Wetzlar five hundred and ninety-five rix-dollars. The only places in its territory worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Geiszlingen, a small town, famous for its fine works in bone.</P>
<P>Leipheim, a town and castle not far from the Danube.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ESZLINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city stands on the Neckar, eight miles east of Stuttgard, and thirty-seven north∣west of Ulm. The inhabitants are partly Luthe∣rans and partly Roman catholics; but the magi∣stracy is entirely Lutheran. The town is under the protection of the duke of Wurtemburg, by whose territories those of the town are entirely surrounded. Here is a college and grammar-school, several churches, a fine town-house, a citadel, a chapel for the Roman catholics, a rich hospital, called St. Catharine's, and the arsenal of the circle. The matricular assessment of this city is thirty-seven florins, and that to the chamber of Wetzlar, one hundred and seventy-seven rix-dollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REUTLINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city stands about five miles from Tubingen, on the little river Echetz, which falls into the Neckar. It is entirely Lutheran, and un∣der the protection of the duke of Wurtemberg.
<PB N="182" REF="1830"/>
This city is said to have been first walled, and made free, by the emperor Frederic II. The citi∣zens cannot be summoned before any foreign tri∣bunal, unless justice be denied or delayed by the magistrates. All that are guilty of involuntary murder find a sanctuary in this town, where they may live without molestation, either in regard to their persons or effects. The matricular assess∣ment of Reutlingen, in the year 1728, was only eighty florins; and that to the imperial chamber fifty-seven rix-dollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NORDLINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city stands on the river Eger, eight miles south-west of Oettingen, ten north of the Danube, and twenty-six north-east of Ulm. The magistracy, and most of the burghers, are Lutherans. It is pretty well fortified, and is said to have been the first of the imperial cities that re∣ceived the doctrine of Luther, anno 1524. The chief public structures are the church of St. George, and that which belonged to the Carmelites before the Reformation, the Latin-school, the hospital of the Holy Ghost, the town-house, the arsenal, and merchant's-hall. Here is a considerable year∣ly fair, with a trade in linen, and dressed skins. The matricular assessment of the city is fifty florins; and that to the chamber of Wetzlar two hundred and nineteen rix-dollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HALL.</HEAD>
<P>The free imperial town of Hall, otherwise called Swabian-Hall, lies on the river Kocher, its ter∣ritory bordering on the margravate of Anspach, the duchy of Wirtemburg, and some other lesser states. The town takes its name from its salt∣springs,
<PB N="183" REF="1840"/>
by which its inhabitants, who are Lutherans, chiefly subsist. It was from hence the old German coins, called Hellers, took their name. There are several churches in the town, besides a college and hospital, a house of the order of St. John, and two bridges over the river. Its matricular assessment is one hundred and eighty florins, and to the cham∣ber of Wetzlar, one hundred and forty rix-dollars. The territory belonging to it is considerable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>UEBERLINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial town stands ten miles north of Constance, on the lake. It is built on a high rock, encompassed with vineyards and orchards, and well fortified, having a harbour, whence it sends wine, fruits, and other commodities, to Constance, and other towns on the lake. There are several mineral springs about the town. Its inhabitants are Roman catholics. To a Roman month it pays one hundred and thirty-nine florins; and to the chamber of Wetzlar one hundred and fifty∣seven rix-dollars. Several parishes are under its jurisdiction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROTHWEIL.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial town stands on the Neckar, and its territories are surrounded by the duchy of Wurtemberg, the landgravate of Baar, and the county of Hohenberg. It is very antient, and be∣ing of the Roman catholic religion, contains seve∣ral convents, and a college of Jesuits. Its matri∣cular assessment is only fourteen florins; but to the imperial chamber it contributes one hundred and fifty-seven rix-dollars. It is of note chiefly for being the seat of a chamber, or court of justice, called the imperial tribunal of Rothweil, consist∣ing
<PB N="184" REF="1850"/>
of seven judges, who are nominated by the emperor; only the prince of Schwarzenberg is he∣reditary chief judge, and may appoint a deputy. The jurisdiction of the court extends over the circle of Swabia, Franconia, and the Rhine; but in these are several states, who are exempted from its au∣thority, except in some reserved cases. An ap∣peal, however, lies from it to the supreme courts of the empire. There is a considerable territory under the jurisdiction of the town, which is for∣tified in the antient manner, and encompassed with broad deep ditches.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HEILBRON.</HEAD>
<P>Heilbron, or Hailbron, i. e. the springs of health, so named from its medicinal waters, much frequented formerly both for drinking and bathing, is a well built city, standing in a pleasant fruitful country, on the Neckar, over which it has a fine stone bridge, sixteen miles south-east of Heidel∣berg. It was made an imperial city by Conrad III. The magistracy, with the greater part of the inha∣bitants, are protestants. As to its matricular assessment, it is one hundred and twenty-six florins; but to the chamber of Wetzlar, it pays one hun∣dred and forty-eight rix-dollars.

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MIMMINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>The imperial town of Mimmingen stands on the Aach, a small river, betwixt the Iler and the Da∣nube, twenty miles north of Kempten. The ma∣gistracy is Lutheran; but the inhabitants are partly Lutherans, and partly Roman catholics. Here are several religious houses. Its assessment in the matricula is an hundred and fifty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar two hundred and eighty∣one dollars. Mimmingen was an imperial city so early as the days of Frederic I. and now enjoys great privileges; in particular, an exemption from the jurisdiction of the tribunal of Rothweil. A good trade also is carried on by it with Swisserland, Italy, and other countries adjacent, in hops, Bavarian salt, grain, cotton-stuffs, and paper. Mr. Wright says, storks are as common here, on the tops of houses, as in Holland. The town is pretty well fortified, and almost as large as Ulm, but not so populous or well built. In its district, which is considerable, are manufactures of brass, pewter, wire, and porcelain, together with a warm bath, a chalybeate spring, and a free hunting-ground, in which the several neigh∣bouring lordships enjoy an unlimited privilege of hunting; but the jurisdiction thereof belongs to the town of Mimmingen. In the same district is also found terra sigillata.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>LINDAU.</HEAD>
<P>The imperial city of Lindau stands at the north end of the lake of Constance, on an island which is
<PB N="186" REF="1870"/>
joined to the continent by a bridge, taking its name from the linden trees that grow about it. Its matricular assessment is an hundred and thirty florins. Of the imperial abbey here we have al∣ready taken notice. The castle, and the Heyden∣maur, or Heathen-wall, as it is called, are thought to be Roman works. The greater part of the in∣habitants are Lutherans, as are also the magistrates. The situation of the town occasions so much trade, that Martiniere says, about one thousand five hun∣dred load of merchandize enters it every week, besides what is brought from the lake, Ger∣many being supplied from hence with the com∣modities of Swisserland and Italy, and these again with the produce and manufactures of Germany. The town, notwithstanding, seems to be but a dir∣ty, ill built place, but is tolerably fortified, and has a considerable territory.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DINKELSBUHL, or DINKELSPUHL.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial town takes its name from its stand∣ing on three buhles or hills, on which formerly grew dinkel, i. e. spelt. In Latin and Greek it is called Tricollis Eeacollis, or Zeapolis. It lies not far from the frontiers of Franconia, and the ri∣ver Wernitz, thirty-five miles north east of Ulm. The inhabitants and magistrates are partly pro∣testants, and partly Roman catholics. The town is a great thoroughfare, and well supplied with fish from the river, and with corn and fruits from the neighbouring country; but its territory is inconsiderable. Its matricular assessment is nine∣ty-six florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays an hundred and forty-eight rix-dollars. There are two convents in it, with a Teutonic house.</P>

<HEAD>BIBERACH.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial town is situate about ten miles from the Danube, and twenty south from Ulm, in a valley surrounded with mountains, and watered by a small river.

The Guelphs, counts of Altorf, and ancestors to the illustrious family now on the throne of Great-Britain, were antiently lords of this town. Its matricular assessment is an hundred florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays sixty rix-dollars.

However, in 1525, the town gave the abbey the sum of thirty-thousand gold guldens, in lieu of all its rights and claims. Its matricular assessment is fifty-two florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays forty rix-dollars. Both the magistracy and burghers are of the Lutheran religion.

<HEAD>CIRCLE of BAVARIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle takes its name from the duchy of Bavaria, which is the most considerable part of it, and is bounded by the circles of Fran∣conia, Swabia, Austria, and the kingdom of Bo∣hemia. Its greatest length, from north to south, is about one hundred and ninety miles, and the greatest breadth, from east to west, one hundred and fifteen; but it is much indented on all sides. There are twenty states in it, some ecclesiastic and some secular. The elector of Bavaria, and bishop of Saltzburg, are joint summoning princes, and di∣rectors. The diets are usually held at Ratisbon, though sometimes at Wasserburg, Landshut, and Muldorf. Of the forty thousand men that were to be maintained by the empire, according to a decree of the diet in 1681, the quota of this circle was eight hundred horse, and one thousand four hundred and ninety-four foot; and of the three hundred thousand florins granted by the diet in 1707, its proportion was eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty-two. With respect to religion, it is one of the mixed. Of the assessors in the im∣perial chamber, one is nominated by the directors for this circle. The elector of Bavaria is heredi∣tary-commander of the circular forces. The air here is healthy, but a great part of the country being mountainous, the soil is none of the most fruitful. The principal rivers are, the Danube, the Lech, the Inn, the Iser, the Amber, and the Salz. The people, in general, are said to be exceeding poor, ignorant, and superstitious, yet not so heavy and unpolished as the Swabians. We shall de∣scribe the several territories contained in this circle,

<P>This archbishopric is bounded on the east by Stiria and the Upper Austria; on the west by the county of Tyrol; on the north by the duchy of Bavaria; and on the south by the duchy of Carin∣thia, and the bishopric of Brixen. It is said to be about one hundred miles from east to west, and upwards of sixty from north to south. With re∣spect to the soil, it is very mountainous, yielding however excellent pasturage, and, in consequence of that, abounding in cattle, and horses remarkable for their mettle and hardiness. This country is particularly noted for the great quantities of salt it produces, which it barters chiefly with Bavaria for corn for its Chamois goats, and its strong passes and castles. Here are also considerable mines of gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, and lapis calami∣naris, with quarries of marble, and a natural hot bath. The principal rivers are the Salza, the Inn, the Ens, and Muer, which, as well as the lakes, and other streams, are well stored with fish. The peasants here are all allowed the use of arms, and trained to military duty. There are no nobles in the country, and most of the lands belong to the clergy. The states consist of the prelates, the ci∣ties, and towns. Notwithstanding this country is under the power of a popish ecclesiastic, and the violent, arbitrary, and oppressive manner, in which the protestants have always been treated, great numbers of them still remained in it till the year 1732, when no less than thirty thousand of them withdrew from it, dispersing themselves in the several protestant states of Europe, and some of them were even sent from Great-Britain to the
<PB N="195" REF="1960"/>
American colonies. Besides brass and steel wares, and all sorts of arms and artillery, there are also manufactures of coarse cloth and linen here. The archbishop has many and great preroga∣tives: he is a prince of the empire, and per∣petual legate of the holy see, in Germany, of which he is also primate. He has the first voice in the diet of this circle, and next to the electors, in that of the empire, in the college of princes, in which he, and the archduke of Austria, preside by turns. No appeal lies from him, either in civil or ecclesiastical causes, but to the pope alone; and he is entitled to wear the habit of a cardinal. He has also the nomination to several bishoprics, and the canonicates that fall vacant in the months in which the popes, by virtue of the concordat, are allowed to nominate, are all in his gift. His suffra∣gans are the bishops of Freysingen, Ratisbon, Brixen, Gurk, Chiemsee, Seckau, and Lavant; and of these, the four last are nominated, and even con∣firmed by him, and not by the pope. At the diet of the empire, his envoy takes place of all the princes that are present, under the degree of an elector. His revenue is said to amount to near two hundred thousand pounds a-year, a great part of it arising from the salt-works. He is able to raise twenty-five thousand men; but keeps in con∣stant pay, besides his guards, only one regiment, consisting of one thousand men. His court is very magnificent, and he has his hereditary great offi∣cers, and high colleges. The chapter consists of twenty-four canons, who must be all noble, but are obliged only to four months residence. At his accession to the see, the archbishop must pay one hundred thousand crowns to Rome for the pall. There is an order of knighthood here, instituted in 1711, in honour of St. Rupert, who was the first bishop of Saltsburg about the beginning of the
<PB N="196" REF="1970"/>
eighth century. The chief places in the arch∣bishopric are,</P>
<P>Salzburg, which gives name to it, and takes its own from the river Salza, on which it stands, and over which it has a bridge. It is the capital of the country, well fortified, and the residence of the archbishop. The castle here is very strong, and as strongly garrisoned, and well provided with provisions and warlike stores. The archbishop's palace is magnificent, and in the area before it is a fountain, esteemed the largest and grandest in Germany. The stables are very lofty, and the number of the horses usually kept by the arch∣bishop, is said to be upwards of two hundred. The city, of which one part stands on a steep rock, is well built, but the streets are narrow, and badly paved. Besides the abovementioned, there are two other stately palaces belonging to the archbishop, one of which is called the Neuebau, and the other Mirabella. The latter of these has a very beau∣tiful garden; and the number of trees in the orangery is so great, that Mr. Keysler tells us, twenty thousand oranges have been ga∣thered from them in one year. The river Salza runs close by the walls of this garden. There are a great many other fine structures in the city, pub∣lic and private, such as palaces, monasteries, hos∣pitals, and churches. In the cathedral dedicated to St. Rupert, the apostle of Bavaria, and a Scots∣man by birth, all the altars are of marble of diffe∣rent kinds, and one of the organs has above three thousand two hundred pipes. The winter and sum∣mer riding-schools here are noble structures. The university was founded in 1620, and committed to the care of the Benedictines, Besides it, there are two colleges, in which young noblemen are educated.</P>
<P>Hellbrun, a seat of the archbishop's, about a quarter of a league from Saltsburg, the gardens
<PB N="197" REF="1980"/>
of which are very beautiful. Here is also a mena∣gerie.</P>
<P>Klesheim, another archiepiscopal palace, three∣quarters of a league from Salzburg.</P>
<P>Muldorf, a town on the Inn, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Hallein, a town on the Salza, noted for its salt∣works.</P>
<P>Gastien, a market-town, noted not only for its warm bath, but also for its gold, silver, and lead mines.</P>
<P>There are several towns and districts in Carin∣thia, and the Lower-Austria, belonging to the archbishop.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BAVARIA.</HEAD>
<P>The utmost extent of this electorate, from south to north, is reckoned forty-seven leagues, and from east to west thirty-three; but the duchy extends only about one hundred miles in length, and sixty in breadth; and is bounded on the north by Bohemia and the Upper-Palatinate; on the east by Austria, the bishopric of Saltzburg, and the bishopric of Passau; on the south by the bishopric of Brixen and the county of Tyrol; and on the west by the bishopric of Augsburg, the marquisate of Burgau, and the duchy of Neuburg: containing one hun∣dred and twenty towns, some walled, and some open, and above three million of inhabitants. It is divided into the Upper and Lower Ba∣varia. The former of which lying under the Alps, is mountainous, cold, and barren, producing lit∣tle corn, and no wine; but abounding in woods, great and small lakes, cattle, wild fowl, and game, Besides medicinal springs and baths, salt∣works, mines of copper, silver, lead, and iron.
<PB N="198" REF="1990"/>
The Lower-Bavaria lying on the Danube, is much more level and fruitful, yielding grain, fruit, and pasturage. The principal rivers that water the duchy, are the Danube, the Inn, the Iser, the Lech, the Atmuhl, the Nab, and the Regen; all which, and the lakes, abound with fish. The states of the duchy consist of the prelates, the knights and nobility; the last including not only the counts and barons, but also the burghers. A committee of the states assemble at Munich, as often as the circumstances of affairs requires it. The only religion tolerated here is the Roman ca∣tholics. The clergy, both secular and regular, are very rich, and the convents very numerous; but the peasants wretchedly poor, their chief sub∣sistance arising from the herds of swine, fed in the woods and forests. The principal manufactures of the country are coarse woollen cloth, velvet, tapestry, stockings, woollen and silk stuffs, clocks and watches. The name of Bavaria is a corruption of Boiaria, and that is derived from the Boii, a warlike peo∣ple, that came from Gaul, and settled here about the time of the emperor Augustus. The country was long governed by dukes, both before Charle∣magne, and after. Upon duke Henry the Lion being put under the ban, in 1180, by the emperor Fre∣deric I. the duchy was given to the pfalzgrave of Wittelsbach, descended from duke Arnulph, na∣tural son to Karlman, great-grand-son to Charles the Great. In 1623, duke Maximilian obtained the electoral dignity, together with the Upper-Pa∣latinate, from the emperor Ferdinand II. as a re∣compence for the service he did him in the war against Frederic V. elector Palatine, and king of Bohemia, who was of the same family with the duke. The present elector is Maximilian-Joseph, son of Charles-Albert, who was chosen emperor
<PB N="199" REF="2000"/>
in 1742. The title of the elector is, By the grace of God, duke of Upper and Lower-Bavaria, as also of the Upper-Palatinate; pfalzgrave of the Rhine, arch-steward of the Holy Roman empire, elector and landgraver of Leuchtenberg. He has five he∣reditary officers, viz. a master of the houshold, a steward, marshal, cupbearer, and huntsman. In 1729, the order of St. George was revived by the elector Albert, the ensign of which is a cross en∣amelled blue, and worn pendant to a broad sky∣blue ribbon, with a black and white border. The elector has the fifth seat in the electoral college, and several votes at the diets both of the empire and circle, in the colleges of the princes and counts. For the duchy of Bavaria, his matricular assessment is that of an elector, viz. sixty horse and two hun∣dred and seventy-seven foot, or one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them: and to the chamber of Wetzlar, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars. His ordinary re∣venues, arising chiefly from the monopoly of corn, salt, beer, and tobacco, tolls, mines, and contri∣butions, amount to between six and seven hundred thousand pounds per annum. With respect to his military establishment, he maintains, in time of peace, about twelve thousand regulars, exclusive of ten thousand militia, the expence of which, it is said, does not amount to quite nine hundred thousand imperial guilders. His court, for magnificence and splendor, is exceeded by none in Germany. During an interregnum, he is vicar of the empire, alter∣nately with the elector Palatine, in all places be∣longing to the vicariate of the count Palatine of the Rhine. In our particular description of the duchy, we shall begin with</P>

<PB N="200" REF="2010"/>
<HEAD>UPPER-BAVARIA, of which the prin∣cipal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Munich, the capital of the whole duchy, and the residence of the elector. It stands on the Isler, seventy miles south of Ratisbon, and two hundred and fourteen west of Vienna, being one of the most pleasant and populous cities of Germany, for its bigness. The number of the inhabitants is said to be about forty thousand. Having been built at first on a spot of ground belonging to a convent, it had from thence, in German, the name of Munchen, i. e. Monk's-town, and a monk for its arms. The elector's palace here is a very grand structure, consisting of several courts, furnished and adorned in the most magnificent manner, with tapestry, gilding, sculpture, statues, and paintings. It contains an amazing collection of jewels, anti∣quities, and curiosities. The great hall is one hun∣dred and eighteen feet long, and fifty-two broad; and the stair-case leading to it, from top to bottom, of marble and gold. In the hall of antiquities are three hundred and fifty-four busts and statues of jasper, and porphyry, brass and marble. In this palace also is a library, containing a vast collection of books, and many valuable manuscripts, in most languages, antient and modern, and a cham∣ber of rarities, among which is the picture of a bravo, or assassin, who is said to have committed three hundred and forty-five murders with his own hand, and to have been an accomplice in, or privy to, four hundred more. The treasury in the cha∣pel contains also a vast number of pictures, pre∣cious stones, medals, vessels of gold and silver, &amp;c. Among other curiosities, here is a cherry-stone with one hundred and forty heads distinctly en∣graved upon it. The gardens of the palace are
<PB N="201" REF="2020"/>
also very fine, and, it is said, a secret passage leads from it to all the churches and convents in the town. There is a great number of other fine buildings in this city, public and private, particu∣larly the riding-house, town-house, opera-room, the Jesuits-college, the large edifice for tourna∣ments, the churches, convents, fountains, &amp;c. Its manufactures are those of silk, particularly vel∣vet, woollen cloths, and tapestry; and it has two annual fairs, at which great quantities of salt, wine, &amp;c. are sold. The streets are broad and re∣gular, and most of the houses well built, and paint∣ed on the out-side. The market place is extreme∣ly beautiful. Mr. Keysler says, the servant maids at the great inns here, on holidays, wear a silver chain round their necks, consisting of three rows; and that their breasts are likewise laced with two other chains of the same metal. He further ob∣served, that it was a general custom to place a green garland, on a bundle of straw, before every house containing the corpse of an unmarried person. The common salutation here, and in the other catholic countries of Germany, is, <HI>Praised be Jesus Christ;</HI> and the answer returned, <HI>For ever, Amen:</HI> two popes having granted an indulgence of one hundred days each time to all that use it. Not far from Munich are four other palaces, with fine gardens, belonging to the elector, viz. those of Sleisheim, Nymphenburg, Dachau, and Sta∣renberg. The first and last are about three leagues from the capital; the second about half a league; and the third about two, at a market town of the same name.</P>

It was an imperial town until 1607; but having been then put under the ban of the empire for opposing some popish processions, it was besieged and taken by the elector of Bavaria, to whom the execution of the sentence was committed. Though accord∣ing to the treaty of Westphalia, it ought to have been reinstated in its privileges, it still continues under the dominion of Bavaria.

<HEAD>The UPPER-PALATINATE.</HEAD>
<P>This country is called the Upper Palatinate, to distinguish it from the Lower, belonging to the elector Palatine, to whom this also belonged until about the year 1620, when the elector, assuming the title of king of Bohemia, in opposition to the emperor, it was transferred to the duke of Bavaria, Maximilian I. with the title of elector: both which were confirmed to his family by the treaty of Mun∣ster; but on condition, that, in case of the failure thereof, they should revert to the Palatine branch. Since this country came to the house of Bavaria, the diets have been discontinued. It is bounded by a part of Franconia and Swabia on the west, Saxony on the north, part of Bohemia and Austria on the east, and the Danube on the south, except∣ing a small part of it, which lies on the other side of that river; being about sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, but intersected by the territory of Sulzbach, and the district of Vilseck, belonging to Bamberg. Though it is not unfruitful in grain, its chief riches arise from its mines of silver, cop∣per, and iron. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Amberg, the capital, standing on the river Vils, twenty-eight miles north of Ratisbon. It is the re∣sidence of the governor and regency, contains an electoral palace, with a college of jesuits, and is well fortified. In its neighbourhood is an iron mine.</P>
<P>Neumarkt, a fortified town, with a castle, twen∣ty-six miles north-west of Ratisbon.</P>

<P>Treswitz, or Trausnitz, a castle on the river Pfreimbt, where Frederic, duke of Austria, is supposed to have been confined, when he was taken prisoner by the elector.</P>
<P>Waldsallen, a rich abbey of Cistercian monks, near a market town of the same name, the abbots of which were formerly princes of the empire.</P>
<P>There are several other small towns in this pala∣tinate, with a great number of market-towns and castles, of which Rothenburg gives name to a lord∣ship almost surrounded by the territories of Nu∣remberg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of FREYSINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>That part of this bishopric which lies in the circle of which we are treating, is surrounded by the duchy of Bavaria. The bishopric was founded about the year 710, by St. Corbinia. The bishop, as a prince of the empire, has a seat and vote in the diets thereof, and of the circle, paying the usual taxes to the empire, circle, and chamber of Wetzlar. He is suffragan to the bishop of Saltzburg, and his chapter consists of fifteen canons, and nine do∣micelli. The only places worth mentioning in this part of the bishopric, are</P>
<P>Freysing, which gives name to the bishopric, and stands near the Iser, on two hills, whence there is a very fine prospect. There are several convents and collegiate churches in and about it, besides the cathedral, the bishop's palace, and a gymnasium.</P>
<P>Ismaring, a village, which gives name to a county, and at which is an elegant palace, belong∣ing to the bishop.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="2080"/>
Burgkrain and Werdenfels, two castles, which give name to two lordships.</P>
<P>The bishop has other lands belonging to him in Upper Bavaria, Austria, Steria, Carmola, and Tyrol.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITIES of NEUBURG and SULZBACH.</HEAD>
<P>These principalities lie mostly in the Upper-Palatinate. The former princes thereof were branches of the Palatine family. Of the Neu∣burg branch Philip William became elector; but both his sons dying without male issue, the other branch succeeded to the palatinate, the duchy of Neuburg, and electoral dignity. Thus both prin∣cipalities belong at present to the elector Palatine. On account of the duchy of Neuburg, the elector has a seat and voice in the college of princes at the diets of the empire and circle, and at that of the latter, on account of Sulzbach also, paying an as∣sessment for both to a Roman month, and the chamber of Wetzlar. Each has a regency of its own, and the inhabitants of both, are a mixture of Roman catholics and Lutherans. In the duchy of Neuburg the principal places are,</P>
<P>Neuburg, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, standing on the Danube, forty miles north of Munich, and west of Ratisbon. It is well built and fortified, contains an electoral palace, with a college of jesuits, and is the seat of the regency.</P>
<P>Hochstadt, a small town on the Danube, in Swabia, near which, at the village of Blenheim, the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene ob∣tained a signal victory over the French and Bava∣rians. There are several other small towns in this duchy, as Lauingen and Gundelfingen, on the Danube, both in Swabia; Hemmau; Burg-Leng∣enfeld,
<PB N="208" REF="2090"/>
Velburg, and Schwandorf, on the Nab; Bleistein or Pleystein; Heydeck; and Hippol∣stein.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the PRINCIPALITY of SULZBACH the most remarkable places are,</HEAD>
<P>Sulzbach, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital. It is the seat of the regency, contains an electoral palace, and has an iron mine in its neigh∣bourhood. The inhabitants are a mixture of pa∣pists and Lutherans.</P>
<P>Weyden, a small town on the Wald-Nab.</P>
<P>Besdies these, there are several market-towns; near one of which, called Freyhung, is a lead∣mine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of RATISBON.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric, which takes its name from the imperial city of Ratisbon, is supposed to have been founded, in the eighth century, by St. Boniface; or, as others will have it, by St. Rupert, prelate of Worms. The bishop is suffragan to Saltzburg, and, as a prince of the empire, has a seat and vote in the diets thereof, and of the circle, paying the usual assessments. The chapter consists of twenty-four canons. Though the bishop's domain lies in the neighbourhood of the city, and his cathedral in it, yet he has little or no jurisdiction over it. His diocese contains one thousand three hundred and eighty-three parishes, chapels of ease, and chap∣lainries, with a great number of abbies and prela∣cies; and he has his heriditary officers, and high colleges. The only places under his temporal ju∣risdiction, worth mentioning, are,</P>
<P>Donaustauf, a market-town on the Danube, giving name to a lordship.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="2100"/>
Werth or Worth, a market-town, with a castle, giving name to a lordship.</P>
<P>Hohenburg, a castle on the river Laubrach, in the Nordgau, giving name to a lordship.</P>
<P>Pachlarn, a small town in Lower-Austria, giving name to a lordship. There are some other di∣stricts and villages belonging to this bishopric.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LANDGRAVATE of LEUCHTENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies in the Nordgau. It had formerly landgraves of its own; but now belongs to the elector of Bavaria, who, on account of it, has a seat and vote in the diets of the empire and circle, among the princes, paying the usual assess∣ments. It is under a particular regency, as to the civil government; but, with respect to ecclesiasti∣cal matters, belongs to the diocese of Ratisbon. The only places in it worth notice are,</P>
<P>Leuchtenberg, a castle and market-town, which gives name to the landgravate, and a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Pfreimbt, a small town, with a castle, at the con∣flux of the Nab and Pfreimbt, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of PASSAU.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric lies on the Danube, and is sur∣rounded by Bohemia, Bavaria, and Austria. It was founded in the eighth century, and is imme∣diately dependent on the see of Rome. The bi∣shop, as a prince of the empire, has seat and vote, among the princes, in the diets thereof, and of the circle. His assessment to a Roman month is eighteen horse, and seventy-eight foot; and his quota to the chamber of Wetzlar ninety-four rix-dollars.
<PB N="210" REF="2110"/>
His chapter consists of twenty-three ca∣nons, who must be all gentlemen; and his reve∣nue, though considerably less than it was, before the erection of the archbishopric of Vienna, is said still to amount to about fifteen thousand pounds per an∣num. The principal places belonging to him are,</P>
<P>Passau, which gives name to the bishopric, and is its capital. It stands on the Danube, where it is joined by the Ilz, near the borders of Austria, and is strongly fortified both by nature and art. The river Ilz is noted for its pearls. Besides the bishop's palace and the cathedral, here are several other churches and convents, with a Jesuit's col∣lege. Passau is famous for the peace concluded in it anno 1552, by which the Lutherans obtained the free exercise of their religion. Baron Polnitz tells us, that the meanest of the women here, upon a Sunday, wear gowns of black velvet, and scar∣let petticoats, with gold lace; and that some of them have pearl necklaces of five or six rows, with rings, and ear-pendants of diamonds. Near the town, on a mountain, stand two strong castles.</P>
<P>Windorf, a market-town,</P>
<P>There are several other small towns and districts here belonging to the bishopric, besides those in Upper and Lower-Austria.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCELY COUNTY of STERN∣STEIN.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies dispersed in the Upper-Palati∣nate, and belongs to prince Lobkowitz, who, on ac∣count of it, has a seat and vote among the princes, in the diets of the empire and circle, paying to a Ro∣man month thirty-eight florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar an hundred and twenty-two rix-dollars.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCELY PROVOSTSHIP of BERCH∣TOLSGADEN.</HEAD>
<P>The territory of this provostship, which was founded in 1108, is surrounded by the archbishop∣ric of Saltzburg and Lower-Bavaria. In 1455 it was exempted from the jurisdiction of the archbi∣shop of Saltzburg, and made immediately depend∣ent on the pope. The archdukes of Austria are its protectors. The provost, as a prince of the empire, has seat and vote among the ecclesiastical princes, in the diets thereof, and of the circle, his assessment to a Roman month being two horse and twenty foot, or an hundred and four florins; and to the chamber of Wetzlar an hundred and twenty rix-dollars. His chapter consists of twelve per∣sons. The only place in the territory worth men∣tioning is,</P>

<P>This county, which is about twelve miles in length, and eight in breadth, is almost surrounded by the duchy of Bavaria, and belongs to the elector thereof, who is entitled by it to a seat and vote in the diets among the counts, paying the usual assessments to the empire, circle, and chamber of Wetzlar. It takes its name from Haag, a mar∣ket-town with a castle, and is now governed as a bailiwie.</P>

<P>This little county lies in Lower-Bavaria, and be∣longs to its own counts, who have seat and voice among the counts, in the diets of the empire and circle, and pay the usual assessments; but their im∣mediate dependance on the empire is disputed by the elector of Bavaria.

<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of EHRENFELS.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory lies in the duchy of Neuburg, and belongs to the elector Palatine, whom it enti∣tles to a seat and voice among the counts of the empire and circle, and consequently subject to the usual assessments. It takes its name from a moun∣tain.</P>
<P>The seigniories of Sulzburg, Pyrbaum, Breite∣neck, and Hohen-Waldeck, belong to the elector of Bavaria, who is entitled, by each of them, to a seat and voice, among the counts, in the diets of the empire and circle, and subjected to the usual assess∣ments. The three first lie in the Upper-Pala∣tinate, and most of the inhabitants are protestants; but the last in Upper-Bavaria, and is inhabited by Roman catholics.</P>

<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of RATISBON.</HEAD>
<P>This city, the capital of the circle, by the Ger∣mans is called Regensburg, from the river Regen, which here falls into the Danube. It lies sixty
<PB N="213" REF="2140"/>
miles north of Munich, is pretty large, and well fortified. The magistracy and burghers are Lu∣therans; but the greatest part of the inhabitants are catholics, and have many churches and convents belonging to them. Of the bishopric we have given an account before. The abbot of St. Eme∣rau, here, and the abbesses of Upper and Lower-Munster, have seat and vote in the diets of the em∣pire and circle, and are assessed in the matriculas. In the first of these abbies are two curious manu∣scripts of the gospel, writ in the eighth and ninth centuries. In the same abbey Apollonius, so di∣stinguished for his skill in the Greek tongue, was educated. The abbot is exempted from the juris∣diction of the bishop, and stands immediately un∣der the pope. In the female foundations, the la∣dy-abbesses are elected by the two chapters of la∣dies, who must be all of noble birth, by sixteen generations; and though the abbesses make vows of celibacy, &amp;c. the other ladies may marry. There are two islands in the Danube, near this city, called Oberwerth and Underwerth, i. e. the Upper and Lower-Island, which are inhabited by millers, boatmen, and fishermen. Besides the abbeys men∣tioned above, among other religious houses, here is a cloister for Scotsmen of the Roman catholic re∣ligion. La Forest says, the citizens have a privi∣lege to throw their children that are incorrigible into the Danube, without being called to account for it. The city drives a great trade, exporting by the Danube, Nab, and Regen, large quantities of salt, corn, wood, and provisions of all sorts. Over the first of these rivers is a bridge here of fifteen arches. The diets of the empire have been held in the council-house of this city, almost without interruption, since the year 1662. Though an∣tiently subject to the electors of Bavaria, it is now imperial, paying a matricular assessment of an hun∣dred

and fifty florins; and to the chamber of Wetz∣lar forty-eight rix-dollars, each term.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of AUSTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded to the west by Swis∣serland, to the east by Hungary, to the south by the Adriatic sea and the territory of Venice, and to the north by Moravia, Bohemia, and the circle of Bavaria. It is of all the circles the first in rank, the largest, and one of those that are called catholic. The greater part of it belongs to the illustrious house that bears the name of it, and hath been in possession of the imperial dignity upwards of three hundred years. The archduke is the summoning prince, and director of the circle; but no diets have been held in it for a long time. Of the whole as∣sessments of the empire it contributes about a fifth, both in men and money; having, tho' not obliged to pay any ordinary or extraordinary taxes to the empire, voluntarily taken on itself the rate of two electors. The assessor in the chamber of Wetzlar for this circle, is nominated by the archduke alone.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROPER ARCHDUCHY of AUSTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>The German name of Oestreich, or Eastern Kingdom, whence our Austrasia, and Austria, was given by the Franks to that part of their monarchy which lay to the east of Gaul, in Ger∣many. A part of that was afterwards made a marquisate, and by Frederic I. in the year 1156, was raised to a duchy. About the beginning of the fifteenth century, when the house of Austria began to grow powerful, they dignified it with the title of archduchy. It is divided into the
<PB N="215" REF="2160"/>
Upper and Lower-Austria, the former lying to∣wards the west, and the latter towards the east; and is bounded by Hungary on the east, Bavaria on the west, Bohemia on the north, and Stiria on the south. It stretches, on both sides the Danube, between sixty and seventy miles, from north to south. Except towards Stiria, the Lower-Austria is level and fertile, producing not only corn and pasture, but saffron, wine, wood, alum, silver ore, and procelain earth; but the air would be unwhol∣some, if it was not often purified by strong gales of wind. The mountain in it, called the Kahle Berg, antiently Mons Cetius, extends from near Vienna into Carniola. At Baaden are hot baths. The rivers by which it is watered are, the Da∣nube, Moravia, Leitha, Trasen, Erlebach, Ips, and Kamp, all abounding with fish. Upper-Austria is mountainous and barren towards Sti∣ria; but the rest is more level and fertile, yield∣ing plenty of fruits, game, wood, salt, iron, medi∣cinal baths, and some petrifying springs, but no wine. Its rivers, besides the Danube, are the Ens, Steyer, Traun, which, as well as the lakes, abound with fish. Both Upper and Lower-Austria are po∣pulous, and full of towns, villages, seats, castles, and cloisters. In some places, the dress of the inhabi∣tants is odd enough; in particular, that of the wo∣men on the other side of the Traun, and in the vale of Stoder. The dialect of Austria differs widely from the High-Dutch, and extends from the Adri∣atic to Swisserland. The diets here consist of the bishops, abbots, provosts, princes, counts, barons, knights, and towns; and in them they treat of the contributions, taxes, military affairs, &amp;c. That of Lower-Austria is held at Vienna, and that of the Upper at Lintz. The nobility, who are very nu∣merous, and have great privileges, as well as the other states, are divided into the higher, consisting of the counts and barons, and the lower, compre
<PB N="216" REF="2170"/>
hending the knights. The margraves of Branden∣burg, as well as the archbishop of Saltsburg, have some fiefs in Austria. The protestant religion, af∣ter the reformation, made a gret progress in this country; but by degrees was prescribed, and sup∣pressed. However, there are still many secret ad∣herents to Lutheranism; and, in the year 1751, the empress-queen promised to protect them, while they behaved themselves peaceably. The archbi∣shop of Vienna is a prince of the Holy Roman empire, and has the honour of the pallium and cross. With respect to the character of the Au∣strians, they are said to be more social and polite than their neighbours, and very hospitable to strangers; but proud and haughty, vain and con∣ceited, especially the younger sort, and those who have places about court. According to baron Pol∣nitz, they are exceeding fond of titles, and the greatest epicures in the world. The luxury of the inhabitants of Vienna, in particular, is said to ex∣ceed that of any other place in the world. At the tables of the great are seldom less than nine or ten different sorts of wine; and Polnitz says, that he has sometimes seen eighteen. The women are rather handsome than beautiful, and naturally vain and reserved; but free from coquetry, and more fond of finery and grandeur, than gallantry: ex∣tremely ignorant, superstitious, and credulous; but generous and sincere. They use neither paint nor patches. For the education of youth, and the im∣provement of the arts and sciences, besides Latin schools and gymnasia, there is the university of Vienna, which is now on a better footing than former∣ly, and the Theresian college, with several riding, military, and other academies, as of painting, sculp∣ture, and architecture. The imperial library is one of the most famous in the whole world. As for ma∣nufactures, the principal are silks, gold and silver
<PB N="217" REF="2180"/>
lace, cloths, stuffs, stockings, linen, mirrors, porce∣lain, plate, brass, and other hard wares. The commodities exported are chiefly saffron, wine, alum, and gunpowder. At the same time, the importation of foreign manufactures is either whol∣ly prohibited, or loaded with heavy duties. An exchange and loan-bank were elected at Vienna in 1704, where is also a court of commerce. Ro∣dolph I. count of Habsburg, who flourished to∣wards the end of the thirteenth century, was the founder of the present Austrian family, which, from that time, gained continual accessions of power, dignity, and dominion; till, at last, in the person of Albert II. it arrived at the im∣perial throne, which it hath possessed, almost without interruption, ever since, for upwards of three hundred years. Among the high privileges of this illustrious house are these: The arch∣dukes may appear or not, as they please, at the diets of the empire; yet nothing can be concluded there without their participation. They are not subjected to any taxes of the empire, and yet may claim its protection. They are exempted from the jurisdiction of all the judicatories, and the ban of the empire; receive the investiture gratis, and in their own territories can create barons, counts, and princes, in any part of the empire; and when the male stock of the family becomes extinct, the hereditary succession is to descend to the eldest daughter. As to the hereditary officers, the counts of Wessenwolf are hereditary stewards in the Upper, and the princes of Trautson in the Lower Austria: the princes of Lamberg here∣ditary chamberlains in the Upper, and the counts of Breuner in the Lower: the latter also, as heredi∣tary play-counts, or masters of the revels, have jurisdiction over all jugglers and minstrels. The counts of Stahrenberg are hereditary marshals; the counts of Harrach hereditary masters of the
<PB N="218" REF="2190"/>
horse; the counts of Hardeg hereditary cupbearers in the Lower, and the counts of Zinzendorf in the Upper Austria. The latter are also hereditary carvers, combat-judges, and combat-shield-bearers, both in Upper and Lower Austria, and heredi∣tary rangers in the Lower, but the princes of Lamberg in the Upper. The counts of Kuf∣stein are hereditary masters of the jewel office; the barons of Hegenmuller hereditary purveyors; the lords of Rappach hereditary Stabelmeisters, or disposers of the staffs, both in Upper and Lower Austria; the counts of Theirheim, hereditary fal∣coners in Upper, and the counts of St. Julian in Lower Austria; the counts of Sprinzenstein he∣reditary mint-masters; the counts of St. Hilario hereditary artillery-masters; the counts of Paar hereditary post-masters; the counts of Albens∣berg and Traun hereditary bannerets in both Austrias; the provosts of St. Polten hereditary chaplains in Lower, and the abbots of Steyerger∣stein in Upper Austria. These offices, to which con∣siderable advantages are annexed, though hereditary in the abovementioned families, cannot be held by them unless they are members of the Catholic church. The order of the knights of the Golden-fleece being common to Austria and Spain, we shall give an ac∣count of it, when we come to treat of the last of these countries. Here are also two orders of la∣dies, who are a sort of knights, both founded by the empress-dowager Eleonora, in 1662. The one consists of thirty ladies, part protestants, part pa∣pists, and is called the order of the Slaves of Virtue. The other is that of the United Cross-bearers, who are seventeen in number, and all papists. The badge of the former is a gold medal, representing the sun, encompassed with a laurel crown, and their motto, <HI>Sola ubique triumphat.</HI> The latter wear on their left-side a four-cornered cross, fastened to
<PB N="219" REF="2200"/>
a black ribbon, at the end of which there is a sparkling star, with four eagles about it, and the motto, <HI>Salus &amp; gloria.</HI></P>
<P>For the government of Upper and Lower-Austria there are several colleges, subordinate to one ano∣ther, the chief of which are held at Vienna. The civil law is of force in Austria, where it is not re∣pugnant to the archduke's ordinances, or those made, with their consent, by the land-diets. The revenues of the sovereign arise partly from the sub∣sidies granted by the states, and partly from the crown-lands, tolls, duties, excise, &amp;c. By virtue of a concession of pope Nicholas V. the archdukes may impose taxes on ecclesiastics. The forces of the house of Austria amounted, in the year 1755, to an hundred and eight regiments of infantry, cuirassiers, dragoons, and hussars, besides twelve independent companies, and fourteen thousand invalids. Of the sixteen million three hundred and eighty-seven thousand eight hundred and sixty-three florins, levied on the whole Austrian hereditary countries, (the Netherlands and Italian states excepted) for the maintenance of this army, Lower-Austria pays two million eight thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight florins, and Upper-Austria nine hundred and six thousand two hun∣dred and twenty-eight. We now proceed to a more particular description, beginning with</P>

<HEAD>LOWER-AUSTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>Lower-Austria, in 1753, was divided into four circles, two of which lie on the south, and two on the north, of the Danube. Those on the south side are called the circles, below and above the fo∣rest of Vienna; and those on the north, the circles below and above Manhartsberg, a mountain so named. The chief places in the first of these cir∣cles are,</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="2210"/>
Vienna, the capital of the whole archduchy, stands on the south side of the Danube, forty miles west of Presburg, forty east of Lintz, one hundred north-west of Buda, one hundred and eighty south-west of Cracow, four hundred and fifty north of Rome, five hundred and sixty east of Rotterdam, five hundred from Paris, six hundred from London, and five hundred and seventy west of Constantinople. The Turks call it Beez, the natives Wien, and the Poles Wieden. The an∣tient Vindobena stood in the neighbourhood. The Danube is here very wide, forming several beau∣tiful islands, well stocked with wood. The coun∣try to the east and north is level; but to the west and south there is a range of mountains, cloathed with trees and vines. It seems to have been a con∣siderable place in the time of the Romans, for it was the station of their Classis Istrica, or navy on the Danube; and here the emperor Marcus Au∣relius Antoninus Philosophus is said to have died. In 1192 it was enlarged, beautified, and walled round with the ransom-money which the mar∣quis of Austria obliged Richard I. of England to pay when he made him prisoner in his return from the Holy Land, because he took down the Austrian banner at Joppa, and threw it into the house of office. This ransom was one hundred and forty thousand marks of silver, Cologne weight; so prodigious a sum for those times, that the Eng∣lish were obliged to sell their church-plate to raise it. The city itself is of no great extent, contain∣ing, besides churches and cloisters, which have generally extensive gardens and walks, about twelve hundred houses, from four to seven stories high, eighty streets, and fifteen principal squares. There are many magnificent palaces in it, and in the burghers houses the second story is allotted for the residence of the imperial court officers. It is well
<PB REF="2220"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of the City of Vienna.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="221" REF="2230"/>
fortified after the modern way, and, including the suburbs, may be about a quarter as big as London and Westminster. It is very populous, having al∣ways great numbers of strangers in it, of most Eu∣ropean nations, in their proper habits, and may con∣tain generally about one hundred and eighty thou∣sand souls. The streets are narrow and dirty, and the air would be very unwholesome, were it not for the high wind, which blow here most part of the year: whence the proverb, Vienna vel ventosa, vel venenosa. In most of the squares are beautiful fountains and magnificent monuments, erected by the emperors. The metropolitan church of St. Stephen is a large magnificent Gothic building, with a tower four hundred and sixty Austrian feet high, and a bell upwards of ten feet in height, and thirty-two in circumference. The bowels of the archducal house at their deaths are deposited in a vault of this church; but their hearts in the cloister church of the bare∣footed Augustines, which is the imperial abbey∣church, and their bodies in that of the capuchin∣cloister. The archbishops revenue is near thirty thousand imperial florins per annum. Among the cloisters, of which there are a great number here, both in the city and suburbs, one of the principal is the Schotten, or Scottish Benedictine abbey, whose abbot is mitred, and a state of the country, and to whose jurisdiction the populous suburb of St. Ulrich, together with the Neubau, are subject. This abbey was founded for the Scots, in honour of their countryman St. Colman, who was former∣ly reckoned the patron of Austria. At the entrance of the church of St. Stephen there is a stone placed in the wall, and held in great veneration by the papists, being supposed to be one of those with which St. Stephen was stoned to death. It looks like a pebble, and is worn very smooth, in conse∣quence
<PB N="222" REF="2240"/>
of the superstition of the people, who are continually touching it out of devotion. From the spire of the church is a most noble prospect of the city and adjacent country, and of the course of the Danube, almost to Presburgh, in Hungary. In the tower there is a case of wooden hammers, with which they call the people to church from Good-Friday to Easter-Sunday, because they will not suffer the bells to ring out during the time that our Saviour is supposed to have lain in the grave. Here are many hospitals, one in particular called the Burgher-spital, in which near three thousand persons are maintained. The imperial palace is a mean old building, consisting of two courts; the inner for the imperial family, and the outer, which is the largest, for lodging the courtiers and guards. The imperial cabinet of coins and medals is the largest and grandest in Europe; and the imperial library equals, if not exceeds, that of the Vatican, and the royal library at Paris, being supposed to contain near one hundred thousand volumes. A∣mong other curious manuscripts is one of Livy, above a thousand years old; a Greek manuscript of Dioscorides, above one thousand one hundred; a Greek manuscript of the book of Genesis, above one thousand three hundred, containing many cu∣rious draughts and represen ations in miniature, or water colours; Luther's Bible, with a great many notes in his own hand writing; a Greek manuscript of the New-Testament, above one thousand five hundred years old, in gold letters on purple. Here is a noble university, endowed with large revenues and privileges, and divided into four classes, having each of them peculiar rules and im∣munities, namely, the Austrian class for the stu∣dents of Austria, Italy, and other countries be∣yond the Alps. That of the Rhine, for the western parts of the empire, France, Spain, and the Ne∣therlands.
<PB N="223" REF="2250"/>
That of the Hungarians, for Hungary, Bohemia, with other countries which speak Sclavonic, and some parts of Germany. Lastly, that of the Saxons, taking in Saxony, Sweden, Denmark, the north parts of Germany, with Great-Britain and Ireland. Hence the stu∣dents here are of many nations. The Jesuits are the only professors of divinity and philosophy. The principal, or chancellor, with the other masters of the university, have the power of life and death over the scholars: but the establishments for paint∣ing, sculpture, and the other fine arts, are on a much better footing here than those for the sciences, espe∣cially in respect to philosophy and divinity, which, as taught in the colleges of the Jesuits, are little better than a heap of scholastic chimeras. How∣ever, in the year 1752, an imperial ordinance was issued, with a view to improve the me∣thod of teaching. Vienna is divided into four quarters, one of which is called the Schotten, that is, the Scottish quarter. One of the gates also is called the Scots gate, in remembrance of some notable exploit performed there by the troops of that nation. The ministers of the protestant crown∣ed heads have chapels here, as in other Roman catholic countries; and some protestants held offices, both civil and military, under the late emperor Charles VI. The Jews were formerly tole∣rated; but, at present, neither here, nor in any other part of Austria. The suburbs are much larger than the city itself. To ride round the line, which encloses them at an ordinary pace, would take up about four hours. The largest of them is called Leopold-stadt, from the emperor Leopold. In that of Rossau, is the grand palace of Lich∣tenstein. In that of Wieden, is the new imperial favourita, or summer-palace. In that called Renn∣weg, is the cloister of the female Salerians, or
<PB N="224" REF="2260"/>
English nuns, with the grand palaces of the late prince Eugine of Savoy, and of the prince of Schwarzenberg. In that called Landstrasze, is a fine cloister of hermits of the order of St. Augus∣tine, who wear white ermine. The garrison here consists of one regiment of foot, who are lodged in caserns. The city, by means of the Danube, is well supplied with provisions, and every thing else useful, necessary, or agreeable. As it is the seat of the court, and the supreme colleges and tribunals, there is a prodigious resort to it, especially of the noblesse, from all the hereditary countries, and others, particularly those of the empire. The grandeur of this court exceeds that of most others. All, or most of the officers of state, and of the houshold, of the horse and foot guards, and above one hundred gentlemen of the bed chamber, who wear golden keys at their breasts, are either princes, counts, or barons; but the etiquette, that is an∣tient forms and usages, which are rigidly observed, tho' universally exclaimed against, give it an air of constraint, that is no where else to be seen. Days of Gala, i. e. festivals and holidays, are very wel∣come both to the court and city. They are of three sorts, the court-gala, the grand-gala, and little-gala. The first are the birth-days, name-days, &amp;c. of the emperor and empress. The se∣cond, those of some minister, which are kept in the city. And the third, when any piece of good fortune happens to a family of rank and distinction, or when any great lady is let blood, which, baron Polnitz tells us, is enough to put the whole city in gala. He observes it as a singular custom at this court, that the empress-dowager can never quit mourning, tho' their officers and domestics may: that their apartments must always be hung, and their coaches covered with black: that they cannot be present at a play, ball, or concert: and
<PB N="225" REF="2270"/>
that, by losing their husbands, they lose the plea∣sures of life.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Vienna is the palace of Schonbrun, the finest of all the imperial palaces: also Hetzendorf, Ebersdorf, and Luxemburg plea∣sure-houses. In the village from which the se∣cond takes its name, the empress-queen, in 1725, founded a charity for the daughters of fifty poor officers, who are maintained gratis, and instructed in the languages and female qualifications. Near the same village is the Neu-Gibaude, where all kinds of rare animals are kept. In the Luxem∣burg palace the imperial family resides, while they take the diversion of heron-hunting. Near Vienna is also the fine summer-palace called Belvidere. The other places of any note in this circle are,</P>
<P>Kloster-Neuburg, on the Danube, a rich foun∣dation of regular Augustine canons.</P>
<P>Baden, a small town, famous for its hot baths, which are impregnated with sulphur, salt, and a little alum; and for a mirror and brass foundery.</P>
<P>Neustadt, a small town, where is a military aca∣demy, not long since erected, in which young gen∣tlemen are instructed by officers, appointed for that purpose, in all parts of the art of war, and by other masters in the mathematics and belles-lettres. Of the fine earth found in this neighbourhood beau∣tiful porcelaine is made.</P>

<P>A cloister of the regular hermits of the order of Cameldulians, situated on a point of the Kahlen∣berg, called Joseph's Berg, the wine and water of which are much extolled. The prospect also
<PB N="226" REF="2280"/>
from this mountain, over the city of Vienna, and the circumjacent country, quite to Presburg in Hungary, is extremely fine.</P>
<P>The most remarkable places in the circle above the forest of Vienna are,</P>
<P>St. Polten, where is a cloister of canons regular of St. Austin, whose provost is supreme hereditary aulic chaplain in Lower Austria.</P>
<P>Ips, in Latin Ipsium &amp; Ibissa, a small town, near where the Ips falls into the Danube. The antient Pons Isis, or Isipontum, appears to have stood somewhere hereabouts, though the very spot is not agreed on.</P>

<P>Mank, a borough, much resorted to by pil∣grims on account of an image of the Virgin Mary.</P>
<P>Molk, or Milk, in Latin Melicium, a market-town on the Danube, near which is an exempted cloister of Benedictines, the greatest and richest in all Austria, and so strong by its situation, that, in the year 1619, it held out a siege. The abbot of this cloister is primate of the land-states of Lower Austria, and president of the state of prelates. The abbey is dedicated to St. Colman, and con∣tains the tombs of many celebrated personages, particularly that of St. Colman, who was the apostle of Austria, and, as it is said, of the blood royal of Scotland; but passing afterwards through this country in the habit of a pilgrim, in his way to Jerusalem, was taken and hanged for a spy. The domains of the monastery were formerly of great extent. In one of its cellars is kept some wine, called St. Colman's wine, said to be above three hundred years old.</P>
<P>The chief places in the circle below the Man∣harts berge are,</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="2290"/>
Laa, or Laab, a fortified town, situate on the river Teya, near which many battles have been fought.</P>
<P>Bulka, or Pulka, a handsome royal market-town, situated on a river of the same name.</P>
<P>Durnkrut, a market-town on the river March, belonging to count Hamilton.</P>
<P>Falkenstein, a market-town, the proprietor of which has the privilege of coinage.</P>
<P>Schloszhof, a small place, giving name to a seig∣niory on the river March, which was purchased by the late emperor Francis, who caused a mountain in it, which lay towards Hungary, and obstructed the prospect of Presburg, to be dug through.</P>
<P>In the circle above the Manhartsberge, the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Krembs, a neat, well-built, walled city, having a great trade, especially at its two yearly fairs, which hold each a fortnight, and are frequented by mer∣chants and traders from all parts of Germany, Bo∣hemia, Moravia, Hungary, and Poland.</P>

<HEAD>UPPER-AUSTRIA, or the Country a∣bove the Ens, is divided into the Hausruck, Traun, Mihel, and Blach Quarters.</HEAD>
<P>The principal places in the Hausruck quarter are,</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="2300"/>
Linz, the capital of Upper-Austria, standing on the Danube, one hundred miles west of Vienna, and one hundred and ten south of Prague. Here is a wooden bridge over the Danube; and on a hill in the neighbourhood is a citadel, which is some∣times the residence of the emperor. The town is well-built of white free-stone, and populous, containing several handsome churches, cloisters, squares, and fountains, and is much resorted to by the nobility, who have pleasure-houses in the neighbourhood. It is also the seat of several courts and colleges for Upper-Austria; carries on a con∣siderable trade in gun-barrels and linen cloth; and has handsome suburbs, with two great yearly fairs, at Easter and Bartholomew-tide. In the neighbourhood, likewise, are plantations of hops.</P>
<P>Wels, a well-built town on the river Traun, said to have been founded by the emperor Vale∣rian, after his expedition against the Scythians in Pannonia. Here is a castle, in which the emperor Maximilian I. died. From this town also the neighbouring extensive barren heath of Welsar takes its name.</P>
<P>Gmunden, a town situated on the lake of Gmund or Traun, which abounds with fish. It has a considerable trade in salt, made at Halstadt, in the neighbourhood, brought hither by the lake, and exported as far as Vienna. The salt-pits were first discovered in 1303, by Elizabeth, consort to Albrecht I. On an island in the lake is a royal citadel, called Ort.</P>
<P>Focklabruck, or Voklabruck, a well-built town, on the river Vokl, which enjoys the privilege of granting protection to all slaves, and whose burgh∣ers and merchants, with their wares, are toll-free, throughout all the Austrian dominions. Near it, in 1626, the rebel Bavarians were defeated.</P>

<P>Kainmer, a citadel, in the Attersee, which is the largest lake in the whole country, and abounds in exquisite fish, of which it yields a new species every month.</P>
<P>Stroham, a filial commandery of the order of Malta.</P>
<P>Schaumberg, a citadel, which gives name to a county, now belonging to the family of Stahren∣berg, but formerly an immediate county of the empire.</P>
<P>The county of Neuberg also was formerly an immediate county of the empire, but now belongs to the bishop of Passau. Tho' this county is a part of Austria, it is surrounded on all sides by Bavaria, and has several citadels in it.</P>
<P>The most remarkable places in the Traun quar∣ter are,</P>
<P>Ens, in Latin Anisia, Anasum, or Anassanum, a fair, strong, and well-built town, situated on the river of the same name, fifteen miles east of Linz, and ninety west of Vienna. It was built in the year 990 on the site of Lauriacum, a Roman co∣lony, destroyed by the Huns, about the year 450, and the seat of some Roman emperors. Ens was formerly subject to its own count, till the emperor Rodolph purchased it, and annexed it to the do∣minions of Austria. The river Ens falls into the Danube, two miles below the town.</P>
<P>Steyer, a considerable town, situated at the con∣flux of the two little rivers Steyer and Ens, and
<PB N="230" REF="2320"/>
inhabited chiefly by smiths, cutlers, and other workers in steel and iron, the latter of which is brought hither from the iron works at Innerberg, upon the Ens. The hard-wares made here are conveyed by the Danube to all the neighbouring parts. The town was formerly the capital of a county, and belonged to Stiria; but the Stirian duke Ottocar, having ceded his duchy to his fa∣ther-in-law, duke Leopold of Austria, it was se∣parated from Stiria, and annexed to the country above the Ens.</P>
<P>This quarter, besides the above towns, contains several monasteries, the chief of which are the rich cloister of Benedictines, near Kremsmunster, and that of St. Florian.</P>
<P>The only places in the Michel quarter worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Schlog, a cloister of the order of Praemenstra∣tenses, situated on the river Mihel, to which, be∣sides other places, belong the lordship of Mirotice, in Bohemia, and a great part of the Bohemian forest, together with all the regalia, rights, and jurisdiction appertaining thereto.</P>
<P>The Millack Bad, a noted medicinal bath, lying not far from the Danube. In this quarter are also several market-towns, citadels, and seigniories.</P>
<P>The principal places in the Blach quarter are,</P>
<P>Freystadt, a royal town, situated on the north side of the Danub, near the borders of Bohe∣mia. It is well built, but not very strong, and is noted for a kind of beer greatly admired in the neighbouring country. Among other privileges, it has that of an annual fair, which continues a fortnight, and is much frequented.</P>
<P>Grein, a small town, in which is a Franciscan cloister, a Loretto chapel, a Mount Calvary, and a hermitage. Near it is also a citadel, called Greinburg, and a whirlpool in the Danube.</P>

<HEAD>The INNER AUSTRIAN COUNTRIES.</HEAD>
<P>The Inner Austrian countries consist of the du∣chies of Stiria, Carinthia, and Carniola, together with a part of Istria, and some other districts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of STIRIA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is divided into the Upper and Un∣der Stiria, or Steyermark, and bounded to the east by Hungary, to the west by Carinthia and Salz∣burg, to the south by Carniola, and to the north by Austria. The air of Stiria is said to be unwhole∣some; whence the Hungarian fever, and other dis∣tempers, are frequent here, besides that which is so common among the inhabitants of the Alps, viz. a large swelling under the chin, to which the poorer sort are most liable, supposed to be owing to drinking the snow-water, which comes off the mountains, and mixes with their brooks and rivers. These swellings are sometimes so ex∣traordinary, that they deprive the patients both of sense and voice; and the poor women, when they suckle their infants, are forced sometimes to lift them up, because they hang so low as to cover their nipple. In most of their towns are hospitals for those that are afflicted by this distemper, in a more than ordinary degree. The Upper Stiria, or Steyermark, is full of high and steep mountains, which, notwithstanding, are generally cultivated and inhabited to the very top. These mountains are buried in snow all winter, and exceeding cold; but the inhabitants are habituated to the severity of the weather, and wonderfully hardy. They contain silver, lead, copper, but especially iron; and their summits are covered with forests, which supply wood for smelting these metals. The Sti∣rian
<PB N="232" REF="2360"/>
steel is reckoned the best in Europe. Among these mountains also are many lakes, abounding with fish, hot baths, medicinal springs, and salt∣works They yield, moreover, a fine sort of wheat, feed large herds of cattle and goats, and abound with wild fowl.</P>
<P>The Under or Lower Stiria, or Steyermark, is more champaign than the Upper, yielding corn, and a very good wine, particularly near Rackes∣burg, Cilli and Luetenberg, with hot-baths, and medicinal springs. In the quarter of Cilli, dor∣mice are reckoned a great dainty, as they are in Carniola and Italy.</P>
<P>In the whole duchy are twenty boroughs, near one hundred market-towns, and about five hundred ci∣tadels: the highways are said to be in very good condition. The common people generally speak Wendish, or a very harsh dialect of the German, and the better sort are masters not only of these, but also of Italian and French. The land-states of this duchy consist, as in Austria, of the prelates, lords, knights, and royal towns, and their assemblies are held at Gratz. The Roman catholic is the only re∣ligion tolerated in Stiria. Seckau is the see of a bishop, subject to the archbishop of Salzburg, whose vicar he is in most part of Stiria. At Gratz is an university, and in some other places, gymnasia and colleges of Jesuits. The principal manufactures of the country are iron and steel works, of which there is a considerable exportation. Stiria continued a marquisate, till the emperor Frederic Barbarossa erected it into a duchy. It has been constantly subject to the house of Austria, since Rodolph I. and to this day retains peculiar immunities. The counts of Trautmansdorf are supreme hereditary stewards; the counts of Wilden∣stein chamberlains; the counts of Saurau marshals; the counts of Windish Gratz, masters of the horse;
<PB N="233" REF="2370"/>
the family of Stubenberg, cup-bearers; the counts of Hardegk, sewers; the princes and counts of Dietrichstein, rangers; the counts of Rothal, masters of the jewels; the family of Wurmbrand, purveyors; the counts of Schrattenbach, carvers; and the counts of Steinpeis, falconers. Stiria is governed by a captain general, who represents the sovereign, and resides at Gratz, where are also several high colleges for the whole of the inner Austrian countries. Towards the maintenance of the army, it contributes 1, 182, 545 florins yearly; but, for the most part, only two regiments of foot lie in it.</P>
<P>The principal places in lower Stiria are</P>
<P>Gratz, in Latin Graecium, the capital of the duchy, situate on the river Muehr, over which is a bridge leading to a large suburb, seventy-four miles south of Vienna. It is well built and forti∣fied, and contains a great many churches and cloisters, together with a fort, in which the col∣leges are held, a diet-house, an arsenal, a Jesuits college, an university, and an hospital. The castle or citadel, in which is the archduke's palace, stands on a high rocky-hill, commanding the town and neighbouring country. Here are two annual fairs which continue each a fortnight. In the castle is a great horn, which is sounded every morning and evening, and a vast large bell, which is rung every morning at seven o'clock. The nobility, who reside here in great numbers, have many palaces, and the burghers are wealthy.</P>
<P>Marburgh or Marchburg, which was once the capital of an independant county, stands twenty∣four miles south of Gratz, and is noted for Roman monuments.</P>
<P>Pettau, commonly called Petovium, but more properly Petovio, a pretty little town situate on the river Drave, thirty miles south east of Gratz.
<PB N="234" REF="2380"/>
It has some thriving manufactures, and is very an∣tient, being frequently mentioned as well by the Roman as other antient authors.</P>
<P>Seckau, a citadel, and the usual residence of the bishop, whose see is at the town of that name in Upper Stiria.</P>
<P>Eggenberg, which gives name to a seigniory, belonging to count Lessie, of Scottish extraction.</P>
<P>Rakesburg or Rakelsburg, situate on the river Muehr, and one of the strongest and best towns in Stiria. The neighbouring country produces plenty of grapes, and other fruits. The burghers have the sole privilege to buy all the new wines from Michaelmas to Catharine-tide, after which the peasants may sell to whom they please.</P>
<P>Luetenberg, a market town, noted for the best wine in these parts.</P>
<P>Cilli or Zilli, formerly the capital of an inde∣pendent county, which the emperoror Frederic III. took possession of in 1457, when the last count was killed, leaving no heirs, and incorporated with Stiria. In this county stands the high mountain Bacher or Pacher, rich in all sorts of ores, as the mineral waters that issue from it evedently shew. The highway between Cilli and Pettau was ori∣ginally a Roman causey, and several Roman mile∣stones and other monuments have been found near it. The inhabitants of the county are all Scla∣vonians, otherwise called Wends or Winds. The town, stiled in Latin authors Cilia, Celia, Celeia, and Zelia, is very antient, and by many Roman coins, and other monuments discovered in and about it, appears to have been antiently a place of great consideration.</P>
<P>Gunnawitz, a market-town, near which is a re∣markable spring, being warm in winter and cold in summer.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="2390"/>
Studenitz, a noble female foundation or priory, belonging to the order of Dominicans.</P>
<P>The most remarkable places in Upper Stiria, are,</P>
<P>Judenburg, the capital, situated on the banks of the Muehr, in a plain, surrounded with high mountains, continually covered with snow, fifty miles west of Gratz, and ninety south of Vienna. It is a handsome town, containing a royal fort, two cloisters, and a college of Jesuits. Here also are two great yearly fairs.</P>
<P>Leuben, a neat pleasant town, standing twenty-five miles north-east of Judenburg, and upon the same river. It was once the capital of a county. Here is a college of Jesuits, two cloisters, and a great trade in iron. Near it is the rich nunnery of Goss.</P>
<P>Seckau, a considerable town, forty miles west of Gratz, and an episcopal see, under the arch∣bishop of Salzburg, by whom the bishop is elect∣ed and invested.</P>
<P>Bruck, on the Meuhr, in Latin Muripontium, a royal town, thirty-three miles north-west of Gratz. It is noted for a great cattle fair, a fine public square, and two monasteries.</P>
<P>Eisenartz, a considerable town, situated forty miles north-west of Gratz, and famous for its mines and forges of iron, whence it has its name. It supplies all Germany with steel, and many places with iron; vast quantities of both being disposed of at the great yearly fair, and at other times.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of CARINTHIA.</HEAD>
<P>A part of this country was antiently called Car∣nia, and the inhabitants Carni; but the former afterwards Carinthia, and the latter Carantani, and Carinthi. The country of Carinthia (what
<PB N="236" REF="2400"/>
goes under that name at present) is bound∣ed to the south by the territory of the republic of Venice and Carniola, to the north by Stiria and the archbishopric of Saltzburg, to the west by Ty∣rol, and to the east by Stiria. The air of this country is cold, and the soil in general mountainous and barren; but there are some fruitful dales or valleys in it, which produce wheat and other grain. The lakes, brooks, and rivers, which are very numerous, abound in fish, and the mountains yield good iron, with some lead, and in many places are covered with woods. The river Drave runs across the country, receiving several lesser streams in its passage. In this duchy are eleven boroughs, twenty-one market-towns, and an hundred and seventy-five castles. The inhabitants are partly descendants of the antient Germans, and partly of the Sclavonians or Wends. The states are constituted as in Austria, and their assemblies held at Clagenfurt. The archbishop of Saltzburg, and the bishop of Bamberg, have considerable territories in this country. Christianity was planted here in the seventh century. The only profession tolerated at present is the Roman catholic. The bi∣shops are those of Gurk and Lavant, who are sub∣ject to the archbishop of Saltzburg. At Clagen∣furt there is a gymnasium for the instruction of youth. This country was formerly a part of the duchy of Bavaria. In the year 1282 the emperor, Rodolph I. gave it to Maynard, count of Tyrol, on condition that, when his male issue failed, it should revert to the house of Austria, which hap∣pened in 1331. The hereditary officers here are, the counts of Rosenberg, stewards; the counts of Herberstein, chamberlains and sewers; the counts of Khevenhuller, masters of the horse; the counts of Dietrichstein, cupbearers; the counts of Para∣deiser, rangers; the counts of Seilern, purveyors;
<PB N="237" REF="2410"/>
the counts of Thurn, jewel-keepers; the counts of Wels, staff-bearers; the counts of Sturgk, carvers; and the barons of Hallerstein, falconers. This duchy has its particular governor or land-captain, as he is called, and towards the expences of the mi∣litary establishment contributes annually six hun∣dred and thirty-seven thousand six hundred and ninety-five florins. Only one regiment of foot is usually quartered in it.</P>
<P>The principal places in Lower-Carinthia are,</P>
<P>Clagenfurt, the capital of the whole duchy, standing an hundred and forty miles south-west of Vienna, being antiently called Claudia, and the seat of the dukes. It is well built and fortified, and contains several churches and convents, with a college of Jesuits, a gymnasium, and a provincial house, in which the states assemble. Here is also an equestrian statue of the emperor Theobald, and two pillars of marble, consecrated, the one to the Holy Trinity, and the other to the Virgin. Aeneas Sylvius says, that in his time, if a man was strong∣ly suspected of theft, they used first to hang him, and then try him, three days after. If he was found guilty, they let his body hang till it rotted; if innocent, they took him down, buried him at the public charge, and prayed for his soul. Be∣tween this town and St. Veit are some remains of an antient town, supposed to be Tiburnia, where Roman coins have been found, and other antiqui∣ties. The Lutheran religion was suppressed here anno 1600.</P>
<P>St. Veit, which was once the capital of the duchy and the residence of the dukes.</P>
<P>Freisach, the oldest town in the duchy, be∣longs to the archbishop of Saltzburg, whose vicar resides in the castle.</P>
<P>St. Andrie, a neat town, standing on the river Lavant, in the territory belonging to the bishop of
<PB N="238" REF="2420"/>
Saltzburg, being itself also the seat of a provostship and bishopric.</P>
<P>Wolfsberg, a small town, standing also on the Lavant, and belonging to the bishop of Bamberg, whose vicar resides in the castle.</P>
<P>Gurk, a market-town, situate on a river of the same name, in the territory of Saltzburg, and the see of a bishop, who is nominated twice successive∣ly by the house of Austria, and the third time by the archbishop of Saltzburg; being in temporals subject to the former, and in spirituals to the latter.</P>
<P>Stein, a citadel, standing on an eminence by the river Drau, having a famous church in it, dedi∣cated to St. Laurence, and containing the body of St. Agatha Hildegard.</P>
<P>St. Ulrich, St. Helena, St. Veit, and St. Lau∣rence, four high mountains, which take their names from the churches on them, whither the country people go in pilgrimage on the third day of Easter:</P>
<P>In this country are also many religious founda∣tions, especially in that part of it which belongs to the bishops of Saltzburg and Bamberg.</P>
<P>The principal places in Upper-Carinthia are,</P>
<P>Villach, twelve miles west of Clagenfurt, near the Drave, over which there is a bridge here. This town is a great thoroughfare from Germany to Italy, and near it are mineral waters, which have an acid taste, with two baths, the waters of which are sulphureous, and moderately hot. This town, which stands among high hills, and is noted for the fine paintings in its churches, &amp;c. belongs to the bishop of Bamberg, who nominates the gover∣nor once in three years, and the emperor the other two.</P>
<P>Sachsenburg, a small town situate on the river Drau, and belonging to the archbishop of Saltz∣burg.
<PB N="239" REF="2430"/>
Near it are three citadels, and a strong pass.</P>
<P>Ortenburg, a small place, which gives name to a seigniory on the river Drau, that had formerly counts of its own, but belongs at present to the prince of Portia</P>
<P>Dietrichstein, another small place, whence the princes of that name take their title.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the south by the A∣driatic sea and that part of Istria possessed by the republic of Venice, to the north by Carinthia and Sti ia, to the east by Sclavonia and Croatia, and to the west by Friuli, the county of Gorz or Goritz, and a part of the gulph of Venice, extending, in length, about an hundred and ten miles, and in breadth about fifty. It is called by the Germans Krain or Crania, which, as well as its antient name Carnia, and its modern Carniola, is derived from its antient inhabitants, the Carni, a tribe of the Scythians, otherwise called Japides, whence this and the adjacent countries were also named Japi∣dia. In this duchy a great many different jargons are spoken, the inhabitants being composed of Ger∣mans, Sclavonians, Croatians, Walachians, Ita∣lians, and Dalmatians: but those chiefly in use are, the Sclavonian or Wendish, and German; the first by the common people, and the latter by those of rank and fashion. Carniola is full of mountains, some of which are cultivated and in∣habited, some covered with wood, others naked and barren, and others continually buried in snow. From the summit of the Loibel or Lobel, a very high, steep, and rocky mountain, which separates Carniola from Carinthia, is a prospect of vast ex∣tent, and very striking. The middle Krain is one
<PB N="240" REF="2440"/>
continued chain of mountains, in which, as well as the others, are many remarkable caverns. Not∣withstanding these mountains, Carniola, in general, is a fruitful country, especially in the vallies, which yield yearly several crops; for when the wheat, rye, barley, lentils, pease, and beans are cut down, buck-wheat, and afterwards hemp, flax, and millet, are sown and reaped. Some parts of the country yield also apples and pears, of which cyder and perry is made; together with chesnuts, wal∣nuts, olives, grapes, oranges, citrons, and lemons. Here is, moreover, good pasture, with herds of horned cattle and horses, all sorts of venison and fowl, sea and river fish, metals and minerals, par∣ticularly iron, steel, lead, and copper; but salt they must have from the sovereign's magazines. There are several rivers in Carniola, of which the Sau is the chief, besides medicinal springs, hot-baths, and inland lakes, of which last the Zirk∣nitzersee is the most remarkable.</P>
<P>It is said to contain twenty-one cities, thirty-five market-towns, above two hundred castles, and about four thousand villages. The common Car∣niolians are a very hardy race, going barefoot in winter through the snow, the men always with open breasts, and sleeping on a hard bench, with∣out bed or bolster. Their food also is very coarse and mean. In winter, when the snow lies deep on the ground, the mountaineers bind either small baskets, or long thin narrow boards, like the Lap∣landers, to their feet, on which, with the help of a stout staff or pole, they descend with great velocity from the mountains. When the snow is frozen, they make use of a sort of irons, or skaits. In different parts of the country, the inhabitants, especially the common sort, differ widely from one another in their dress, language, and manner of living. In the Upper and Lower Krain they wear long beards.
<PB N="241" REF="2450"/>
Such as live by exporting the commodities of the country on pack-horses are called Samers, or more properly Saumers. The states of Carniola con∣sist of the clergy, the nobility, knights, and royal towns. Christianity was first planted in this coun∣try about the middle of the eighth century, and, in the sixteenth, Lutheranism made a considerable progress in it; but, excepting the Walachians or Uskokes, who are of the Greek church, and stile themselves Staraverzi, i. e. Old Believers, all the inhabitants at present are Roman catholics. In the whole duchy are three bishoprics, twenty-four cloi∣sters, four commanderies, and one hundred and thirty-four parishes; but to the bishopric of Ley∣bach belong also many parishes in Stiria and Ca∣rinthia. The principal commodities exported from hence are iron, steel, quick-silver, white and red wine, oil of olives, cattle, sheep, cheese, linen, and a kind of woollen stuff called mahalan, Spanish leather, honey, walnuts, and timber, together with all manner of wood work, as boxes, dishes, trench∣ers, spoons, sieves, &amp;c. Carniola was long a mar∣quisate or margravate; but in the year 1231 was erected into a duchy. On the extinction of the margraves, the inhabitants made choice of Frede∣ric II. duke of Austria and Stiria, for their sove∣reign. The arms of Carniola are an eagle crowned, on whose breast and expanded wings is to be seen a diced crescent. The counts of Thurn are su∣preme hereditary stewards in Carniola and the Windish Mark; the house of Aversberg, chamber∣lains and marshals; the prince of Lamberg, mas∣ter of the horse; the count of Cobenzel, cup∣bearer; the barons of Eck and Hohenwart, sewers; the count of Gallenberg, ranger; the count of Katzenstein, keeper of the jewels; the baron of Eck, staff-bearer; count Sauer of Ankenstien, carver; and the count of Lanihieri, falconer. The
<PB N="242" REF="2460"/>
principal officers for the government of the coun∣try are, the land-captain or governor in chief, the burgrave of the citadel of Laybach, the land-lieu∣tenant, and the land-vicar. These preside in the supreme colleges and tribunals. Carniola, as its proportion towards the maintenance of the army, pays annually three hundred and sixty-three thou∣sand one hundred and seventy-one florins; but on∣ly two regiments of foot are quartered in it.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>As this duchy comprizes the Upper, Lower, Mid∣dle, and Inner-Carniola, with a part of Istria, we shall mention the principal places in each. Those in UPPER-CARNIOLA are,</HEAD>
<P>Laybach, in Latin Lublana or Labacum, the ca∣pital of the duchy, standing an hundred and forty-four miles south-west of Vienna, on the site of the antient Aemona, Haemona, or Haemonia, and on both sides of a small river of the same name, which is the boundary between Upper and Lower-Carnio∣la; so that it is partly in the one, and partly in the other. One part of the town is inhabited chiefly by butchers, another by fishermen, and another by mariners. It is the see of a bishop, who stands im∣mediately under the pope; and has an old castle, but is not very strong, especially towards the river. Here are several convents of both sexes, a Jesuits college and gymnasium, a cathedral, a fine diet-house and council-house, three arsenals, and two commanderies, (one of the knights of Malta, and the other of the Teutonic order) with a learned society, called Academia Operosorum. The town carries on a good trade, and the river is said to breed the largest cray-fish in Europe.</P>
<P>Bischoflack, in Latin Locopolis, a town belong∣ing to the bishop of Freysingen, with a ci∣tadel. The seigniory annexed to it extends about
<PB N="243" REF="2470"/>
ten German, or forty English, miles in circuit, and contains two hundred villages.</P>
<P>Krainburg, a royal town on the river Sau, de∣fended by a citadel, and formerly the residence of the margraves of Krain or Krainburg. It is sup∣posed to have been a Roman colony, coins, me∣dals, and other Roman antiquities, having been found about it.</P>
<P>Ratmansdorf, a small but royal town, with a citadel. Here also Roman coins have been found.</P>
<P>Stein or Kamneck, in Latin Lithopolis, an old town on the Feistritz. Near it are two castles.</P>
<P>Asling or Jessenize, a market-town on the Sau, where a fine marble is dug. Near it also, on the Sau, are batteries, and furnaces, in which iron and steel are smelted and worked.</P>
<P>Neumarktl, Tersezch, or Tershizh, a market-town, in which a great deal of Spanish leather, with a stuff called Masalan, and vessels of copper and iron, are manufactured.</P>
<P>Watsch, a market-town, near which is a quarry of hard stone, full of the shells of sea-muscles and periwinkles.</P>
<P>Feuchting, in Latin Bitina, the largest village in Carniola, being a mile in length, and inhabited mostly by sieve-makers.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The principal places in LOWER-CAR∣NIOLA are,</HEAD>
<P>Gurkfeld or Kersko, a royal town on the Sau, where Noviodunum is supposed to have stood, many Roman coins, and other antiquities, having been found about it.</P>
<P>Landstrasz, a royal town, but small and ill built, situate on an island in the river Gurk. In the neighbouring country are great numbers of chesnut
<PB N="244" REF="2480"/>
trees, and the inhabitants are chiefly Walachians, of the Greek church, who, it is said, pay the emperor no tribute, but own him for their sove∣reign, and, upon occasion, furnish him with men.</P>
<P>Rudolphswerth or Neustadtlein, a royal town on the river Gurk, which the archduke, Rodolph I. founded in 1365, endowed with many privileges, and called after his name. It is well fortified, and famous for the baths in its neighbourhood, and the best wine in these parts.</P>
<P>Weichselburg, a small but royal town, with a citadel. Near it is a Cistercian cloister, and the village Dobravaa, in which is the antient and cele∣brated church of Our Lady's Ascension, whither many pilgrimages are made.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MIDDLE-CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This division contains that tract commonly called Dry-Carniola, from its want of water, which, notwithstanding, is pretty well inhabited; but its greatest curiosity is a lake, denominated from a small town in the neighbourhood, the Zirknitz or Cirk∣nitz-see. This lake is about one German, or four English miles, in length, and half as much in breadth, contains three beautiful islands, and is encompassed at some distance with mountains and forests. But what is most remarkable, is, that it disappears generally once a-year, about St. John or St. James's day, running off through holes or pits in the bottom; sometimes it will disappear twice or thrice a-year; and sometimes even in winter, if the weather be dry. On the other hand, it has been known to continue two or three years without running off. Of the holes or pits, there are five much larger than the rest, each of which successively, when the water runs off, stands empty
<PB N="245" REF="2490"/>
five days; so that the whole lake becomes dry in twenty-five. As soon as the beginning of the ebb is observed, the fishing in the pits begins, which belongs to five seigniories. The fish, which are carp, tench, pike, eels, and two other sorts, called schleien and ruten, are caught by laying nets over the holes. Mr. Keysler tells us, that upon the ringing of a bell at Zirknitz, when the waters begin to fall, the peasants, both men and women, run to the pools quite naked, notwithstanding both the clergy and magistrates have used their utmost endeavours to suppress so indecent a custom. When the water runs off early in the year, in about three weeks af∣ter it is gone, there is good grass on the bot∣tom, which is mowed down, and the bottom after∣wards ploughed, and sowed with millet. If the water runs not off early, nothing can be sown; and if it returne soon, the seed is lost. With respect to its return, the water, at first, bursts out of some pits on the south side with great violence, a little rain always falling at the same time; but af∣terwards, (when the rain falls heavier, and it thun∣ders at the same time so loud, as to shake the earth) it breaks out through all the apertures with great force, insomuch that the lake is filled in eighteen or twenty-four hours, at which time it is in a man∣ner covered with wild fowl, such as geese, ducks, &amp;c. After the millet-harvest, all manner of game is hunted, caught, or killed in it. On the south side are two caverns, out of which, when it thun∣ders, water issues with astonishing violence; and, if it happens in harvest, a great many naked, black, and blind, but fat ducklings, are brought up with the water, which in fourteen days receive their sight, and are covered with feathers.</P>
<P>The principal towns in Middle-Carniola are,</P>
<P>Gottschee, which, though small, is the capital of a county, and contains a large citadel.</P>

Laas, a small but royal town, with a citadel.</P>
<P>Mottling, a royal town on the river Culp, in the Windish Mark. Here is a Teutonic house or commandery, with a citadel, and seigniory an∣nexed to it. The inhabitants subsist chiefly by fattening hogs, in two neighbouring woods, of chesnuts and oaks.</P>
<P>Tschernembl, a royal town in the Windish Mark, with a citadel, to which a seigniory is annexed, and a commandery of the Teutonic order.</P>

</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>INNER-CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This division contains many mountains and vine∣yards, but little corn-land or fresh water. There are also many grottos or caverns in it, some of which extend several miles, and have open spaces in them, in which villages might stand, with many curious natural representations in stone, as of thea∣tres, bridges, &amp;c. The grotto of St. Mary Mag∣dalen, near the market-town of Adlsberg, is un∣commonly beautiful. A person would imagine that he walked round the ruined walls of an old magnificent palace, of which the still in part un∣damaged, and partly broken ruined columns strike the eye. Of the rivers here, the Timavus hath been celebrated of old. It issues from seven aper∣tures in a rock between Tybein and St. John. The only places worth mentioning in this part of Carniola are,</P>
<P>Tybein or Duin, in Latin Duinum, a town si∣tuate on the Adriatic, and containing a small har∣bour, with a cloister and citadel. In the neigh∣bourhood a beautiful black marble is dug. In the rocks on the sea is found a kind of snail, about the
<PB N="247" REF="2510"/>
thickness of a man's fist, and eatable. That part of the rock, which incloses them, has always several apertures in it.</P>
<P>Alben, in Latin Planina, a market-town, envi∣roned on all sides with high mountains, large fo∣rests, and dark deserts.</P>
<P>Lueg, i. e. the hole, otherwise Jamma, a cita∣del so situated under a rock, in the centre of a high craggy mountain, that no rain falls upon it; but it has a roof to defend it against the water, that trickles from the rock. There is no other prospect from it but that of the heavens.</P>
<P>St. Serf, a citadel, on a mountain about a mile from Triest, which takes its name from St. Ser∣vulus, whose hermitage was in a neighbouring cavern, where white and grey drop-stones form ma∣ny curious figures. The steps that lead to the castle are hewn out of the rock, and the entry to it, lying through the mountain, is so dark, that a light is necessary. It contains a riding-school, which is also hewn out of the rock.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ISTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>That part of Istria which belongs to the house of Austria is very fertile in corn, wine, and oil, and is divided into the county of Metterberg, and the seigniory of Castua; the former of which is the pro∣perty of the house of Aursberg, and is governed by a captain. It contains twenty-eight parishes, of the churches of which five are collegiate, with two ca∣thedrals, four cloisters, and several seigniories, ci∣tadels, and towns. Of the last the most considera∣ble are,</P>
<P>Metterberg, which gives name to the county, and is its capital. It is an open place, but has a castle, with a cloister, and several churches.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="2520"/>
Biben, the see of a bishop, to whose jurisdiction belongs fourteen parishes, containing two towns, and eleven villages; but the bishop himself is suf∣fragan to the prelate of Gorz.</P>
<P>Antignana, a pretty large town, but not very populous.</P>
<P>Berschetz, a little town on the Adriatic, with a small harbour. In the neighbourhood is made a thick and very sweet wine, of a dark red colour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The SEIGNIORY of CASTUA.</HEAD>
<P>This seigniory fell to the house of Austria in the year 1400, and was incorporated with the duchy of Carniola. It belongs to the Jesuits of St. Veit on the Pflaum, who govern it by a captain, from whom lies an appeal to the court in Carniola. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Castua, which gives name to it, and lies on the Adriatic. In a castle here resides the captain of the seigniory.</P>
<P>Volonska, a market-town on the Adriatic. Near it is a very fine large harbour, in which a whole fleet may lie, and many thunnies are taken.</P>
<P>Moschenize, a small place, near which a fine marble is dug.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The other towns and territories subject to the re∣gency of Inner-Austria are, the town of St. Veit on the Pflaum, the territory of Triest, the Idrian-Bottom, the captainship of Tulmino, the coun∣ty of Gorz, the county of Gradisca, and the ter∣ritory of Aquileia.</HEAD>
<P>The town of St. Veit, by the Italians called Fiume, lies on a bay of the Adriatic, called Il Golfo de Carnero, at the mouth of the river Pflaum, otherwise called Reka and Fiumara, in Latin Flu∣men
<PB N="249" REF="2530"/>
S. Viti. This town is well fortified, and has a castle, with a small harbour, from which large quantities of goods are exported, brought partly from Hungary, and the other Austrian countries. The neighbouring dale yields good wine, figs, and other fruits. Formerly this town was incorporated with the duchy of Carniola, and bore a share of all its imposts; but now it is neither reckoned a part of Carniola, nor is subject to its taxes. The go∣vernor of the town is stiled captain, and resides in the castle. Near the town, on the other side of the river, is a celebrated chapel of Mary of Loretto, on the spot where the Sancta Casa is said to have stood for three years, seven months, and four days, before it was conveyed by the angels to Loretto, in Italy, in the year 1294. The gulf on which the town stands abounds in fish, among which is a sort called gatta, whose skin, forming a sort of shagreen, is used for the cases of watches, caskets, telescopes, &amp;c. In the same bay also are found large stones, of a kind of brown marble, contain∣ing often living muscles, which are smooth and brown, and resemble the kernels of dates, much more than those found on the strand, in the mar∣quisate of Ancona.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The TERRITORY of TRIEST.</HEAD>
<P>The only place in this territory worth mention∣ing, is the town which gives name to it.</P>
<P>This town, in Latin Tergestum, is situate on a bay of the Adriatic, called II Golfo de Triesté, and on the side of a mountain, on the top of which is a castle. It stands sixty-three miles from Venice, and is a small, but strong and populous place, with a large harbour. It hath been lately much improved, and declared a free port, in con∣sequence of which no duties are paid for goods
<PB N="250" REF="2540"/>
brought hither, either by land or water, in or out of the time of the fairs, except for iron, steel, copper, quicksilver, salt, gunpowder, mirrors, and crystal. Triest is the see of a bishop, who is suf∣fragan to the archbishop of Gorz, and bears the title of count of Triest. The sovereign-captain, who governs the town and its territory, resides in the castle. Great quantities of salt are made here, and exported; but the German merchants have nei∣ther sufficient capitals, nor a proper assortment of goods and manufactures for exportation, to make trade flourish to any considerable degree. Near a village in this territory, called Prossegk, the antient Puzinum, an excellent wine is produced, called reinfall.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The IDRIAN-BOTTOM.</HEAD>
<P>This bottom lies between Carniola and the county of Gorz. It takes its name from Idria, a royal market-town, which is immediately subject to the Inner-Austrian aulic chamber of Gratz, and lies in a deep valley, amidst high mountains, on the little river Idria. This town has a castle, and is famous for its quicksilver mines. The virgin∣quicksilver is found in numerous small drops, in many ores, upon beating them to pieces, and sometimes trickles down through the veins of the mountains; but the common sort is extracted by fire out of the ore. The virgin is much dearer than the common sort, which is sold for two florins a pound. Sometimes two thousand six hundred centners or hundred-weights, of the common sort, are extracted in a year, and an hundred of the vir∣gin collected.</P>

<PB N="251" REF="2550"/>
<HEAD>The CAPTAINSHIP of TULMINO</HEAD>
<P>Is a pretty large, but mountainous territory, be∣longing to the counts of Coronini, and enclosed by the Upper and Inner Carniola, Carinthia, the Idrian-Bottom, and the county of Gorz. The principal place in it is,</P>
<P>Tulmino, a market-town, with a castle, on a mountain, near the little river Tulmin.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The COUNTIES of GORZ and GRADISCA.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Gorz, in Latin Comitatus Goritiae, is by geographers, but falsely, made a part of Carni∣ola, has the captainship of Tulmino to the north; Carniola, and the Venetian territory of Mosacolne, to the south; Carniola and the Idrian-Bottom to the east; and to the west the Venetian Friuli. This county abounds in wine, red and white, silk, corn, fruit, and goats, but has little oil, and few horses or oxen. The river Lisonzo, antiently the Son∣tius, and in Italian II Sontio, traverses it, and falls into the Adriatic. People of note here speak Ita∣lian and German; but the lower sort either Sclavo∣nic, or a jargon made up of Italian and French, called Furlan, or Friulian. The Roman catholic is the only religion of the country. As to the ec∣clesiastical jurisdiction, it belonged not long ago to the patriarch of Aquileia, but now to the archbi∣shop of Gorz, who, with his chapter, is possessed of all the estates, revenues, and jurisdiction in this county, that formerly belonged to the patriarch. Count Leonhard of Gorz dying, in 1500, without male heirs, the emperor Maximilian I. by virtue of certain antient stipulations, took possession of the county, and, ever since that time, it has con∣stantly remained in the house of Austria. It is
<PB N="252" REF="2560"/>
governed by a lord-lieutenant; and, for the ad∣ministration of justice, there is a tribunal, from which an appeal lies to the Inner Austrian regency at Gratz. Towards the maintenance of the army, the two counties of Gorz and Gradisca, contribute yearly forty-one thousand five hundred and two florins. The chief place in the former is,</P>
<P>Gorz, in Latin Goritia, which gives name to it, and has been ever since the year 1751, the see of an archbishop It lies fifty eight miles north-east of Venice, in the middle of a wood, and is divided into the Upper and Under Town, being pretty large and strong, and the residence of the go∣vernor.</P>
<P>As to the county of Gradisca, the lord lieute∣nant of the county of Gorz is at the same time captain of Gradisca. The only place worth men∣tioning in it is that from which it takes its name, viz. Gradisca, which is a little, but well-fortified town, on the river Lisonzo.</P>
<P>The territory of Aquileia also is governed by the lieutenant of Gorz. With respect to the patri∣archate of Aquileia or Aglar, an agreement was made in 1751, between the house of Austria, and the republic of Venice, which was confirmed by the pope. By virtue thereof, the patriarchship is quite abolished, and instead of it, two archbi∣shoprics erected, viz. one at Gorz, and another at Udine. To the jurisdiction of the former be∣long the Austrian countries, before subject to the patriarch; and to the latter, those of Venice that were subject to him. As to the town of Aquileia or Aglar, it is now an inconsiderable place, with an unwholesome air, containing, besides the an∣tient patriarchal church, another, with a cloister of nuns.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="2570"/>
Those called the Anterior Austrian Countries com∣prehend the county of Tyrol, under which may be included the territories belonging to the bishops of Brixen, Trent, and Chur, Tuetonic Order, and the prince of Dietrichstein, the Au∣strian seigniories before the Arlberg, and the Austrian districts in Swabia.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of TYROL.</HEAD>
<P>This county, with regard to the face of it, is very mountainous. Of these mountains, some have their tops always buried in snow; others are covered with woods, abounding with a va∣riety of game; and others are rich in metals, and marble of all colours. Of the lower, some yield plenty of corn, others wine, and woods of chesnut trees. The vallies are exceeding fertile also and pleasant. In some places considerable quanti∣ties of flax are raised, in others there is a good breed of horses and horned cattle, and, among the mountains, abundance of chamois and wild goats. In this country are also found precious stones of se∣veral sorts, as granates, rubies, amethysts, emeralds, and a species of diamonds, agates, cornelians, chal∣cedonies, malachites, &amp;c. nor is it without hot∣baths, acid-waters, salt-pits, mines of silver, cop∣per, and lead, mineral colours, alum, and vitriol. The principal river of Tyrol is the Inn, which after traversing the country, and receiving a number of lesser streams into it, enters Bavaria, in which, at Passau, it falls into the Danube. The men here are very tall, robust, and vigorous; the women also are stout, and generally fair: and both sexes have a mixture of the Italian and German in their tempers and characters. As there is little trade or manufacture in the country, except what
<PB N="254" REF="2580"/>
is occasioned by the mines and salt works, many of the common people are obliged to seek a sub∣sistence elsewhere. A particular kind of salu∣tation is used all over Tyrol. When a person comes into a house, he says, <HI>Hail! Jesus Christ:</HI> the answer is, <HI>May Christ be praised, and the Holy Virgin his mother.</HI> Then the master of the house takes the visitor by the hand. This salutation is fixed up in print at all the doors, with an adver∣tisement tacked to it, importing, that pope Cle∣ment XI. granted an hundred days indulgence, and a plenary absolution to those who should pro∣nounce the salutation and answer, as often as they did it. The emperor has forts and citadels so advantageously situated on rocks and mountains all over the country, that they command all the val∣lies, avenues, and passes that lead into it. The inhabitants, however, to keep them in good hu∣mour, are more gently treated, and not so highly taxed, as those of the other hereditary countries. As to the states, they are much the same in this coun∣try as in the other Austrian territories, except that the peasants here send deputies to the diets. Tyrol came to the house of Austria in the year 1363, when Margaret, countess thereof, bequeathed it to her uncles the dukes of Austria. The arms of Tyrol are an eagle gules, in a field argent. The counts of Trap are hereditary stewards; the lords of Glosz, chamberlains; the princes of Trautson, marshals; the counts of Wolkenstein, masters of the horse and carvers; the house of Spaur, cup∣bearers; the counts of Kunigl, sewers, and rangers; the counts of Brandis, keepers of the jewels; the house of Welsperg, purveyors and staff-bearers; and the counts of Coalto, falconers. Besides the governor, here are three sovereign colleges, subor∣dinate to the court at Vienna, which sit at Inspruck,
<PB N="255" REF="2590"/>
and have their different departments. Towards the expences of the military establishment of this county, the proportion is one hundred thousand florins, yearly; but no more than one regiment of foot is generally quartered in it.</P>
<P>Tyrol is divided into six quarters, as they are called, namely, those of the Lower and Upper Innthal, Vintsgow, Etsch, Eisack, and Puster∣thal.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The most considerable places in the LOWER INN-THAL QUARTER are,</HEAD>
<P>Inspruck, or Ynsbrug, in Latin Oenipons, or Oenipontium, the capital of the county, situated on the river Inn, fifty-seven miles south of Mu∣nich, and two hundred and twenty-five west of Vienna. Its name is compounded of that of the river, and the German word pruck, prugg, bruck, or brugg, signifying a bridge. It is a little, but handsome and agreeable city, with large suburbs, standing in a pleasant valley, surrounded with mountains, of which the lower parts are well cul∣tivated, but the tops continually covered with snow. Formerly it was the residence of the arch∣dukes, and at present of the governor and sove∣reign colleges. In the city and suburbs are many fine palaces, churches, convents, fountains, mar∣ket places, &amp;c. The castle, where the antient counts, and princes of the Austrian family, used to reside, is stately, large, and convenient, but not very regular or beautiful, as having been built at several times. It is adorned with some fine paintings, particularly the labours of Her∣cules in fresco, and a picture of Mary, queen of Scots. Here also is a cabinet of curious rarities, with natural and artificial fountains, statues, plea∣sant gardens, groves, walks, and covered galleries,
<PB N="256" REF="2600"/>
that lead from it to five different churches. Adjoin∣ing to it is a wooden palace, whither the court used to retire when an earthquake happened, to which the city, by being shut up among so many mountains, is frequently subject. The fortifications, it is said, are not extraordinary; but, about a mile off, is the strong castle of Amras, or Ambras, which commands the town. In the Franciscan church is a noble monument erected by Ferdinand I. to his grand-father Maximilian; and a chapel, called the silver chapel, because there is an image of the Virgin of solid silver, as big as the life, in the middle of the altar, together with many other images of saints, all of the same metal. This is held to be one of the most sacred and venerable chapels in the world, by the Roman catholics, on account of the indulgences granted to it by several popes, so that one mass said in it is thought suffi∣cient to deliver a soul from purgatory. In this city Christina, queen of Sweden, first abjured the protestant religion in 1655; and, in 1719, the princess Sobieski was detained here by the empe∣ror's orders, when she was going to Italy, to be married to the pretender: however, she soon made her escape, and was married to him.</P>
<P>Hall, which stands a league north-east of In∣spruck, on the Inn, and is reckoned the second city in Tyrol. It is famous for its salt-works, there being, in this neighbourhood, a salt-mine, out of which large blocks of salt are dug, and thrown into pits filled with fresh water; from whence the salt, when melted, is conveyed by wooden troughs to Hall, and there boiled in huge pans or cisterns. A great number of pea∣sants are continually employed in felling trees in the woods of fir, with which the double range of mountains along the Inn are covered. These being rolled down from the mountains into the river,
<PB N="257" REF="2610"/>
are conveyed by it to Inspruck and Halle. The saltworks and the mint (in the last of which a great deal of money is coined of the copper and silver dug out of the mines of Tyrol, wherein, it is said, seven thousand men, women, and children, are constantly employed) with the great trade driven on in copper and tin by means of the Inn, make this a very flourishing place, tho' in the neighbourhood of Inspruck.</P>
<P>Kuffstein, a fortified little town on the Inn, near which is a strong castle, hewn out of a rock, and called Gerolzeg.</P>
<P>Rattenberg, a small, but strong town, with a castle, on the Inn.</P>
<P>Kitzbichl, the capital of a seigniory, belonging to the count of Lamberg, and containing one hun∣dred and fifty-seven villages and hamlets.</P>
<P>Schwatz, a very fine market-town on the Inn, near which is a mine of copper, mixed with silver. This mine yields about twenty thousand marks of silver in a-year, at the rate of one mark for every forty pounds of copper. Blue and green mineral colours are also found here.</P>
<P>Ambras, or Ombras, a royal palace and castle on an eminence in the neighbourhood of Inspruck and Halle, containing an arsenal with a prodigious collection of curiosities, consisting of a vast num∣ber of medals, precious stones, suits of armour, rich trappings, statues of several princes on horse∣back, in their old rich tilting accountrements, a great variety of spoils and trophies, taken in some of the most important victories obtained by the house of Austria, for two or three hundred years. In particular here are the statues of Francis I. on horseback, representing him and his horse, just as they were taken in the battle of Pavia; and of two Turkish bashaws, with the costly habits and har∣nesses with which they were taken, embellished with
<PB N="258" REF="2620"/>
gold, silver, and precious stones. Here is also a very extraordinary natural curiosity, namely, an oak inclosing the body of a deer. The prospect from the castle is very striking and agreeable.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The most remarkable places in the UPPER INN∣THAL QUARTER are,</HEAD>
<P>Cirl, or Zirl, on the river Inn, near which is the steep rock of Martinswand, where Maximilian I. in the too warm pursuit of a chamois, very nar∣rowly escaped with his life. On the top of the rock a wooden cross hath been erected, which, tho' forty feet high, appears from below to be scarce two feet in height, so lofty is the rock. Near the cross are also the images of St. John and the Virgin Mary as big as the life.</P>
<P>Hartenberg, the capital of a seigniory, which had formerly counts of its own.</P>
<P>Scharnitz, a frontier town towards Bavaria, for∣tified in the modern manner.</P>
<P>Stambs, a Cistercian cloister, where the antient counts of Tyrol and Gorz, and all the sovereigns of the Tyrolian race, down to Maximilian I. with their consorts and children, lie interred.</P>
<P>Lermosz, a village, where, according to some historians, the emperor Lotharius II. died in a peasant's hut.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the QUARTER of VINTSGAW, or VINTSCHAU, in Latin Vallis venusta, antiently inhabited by the Vennones, the chief places are,</HEAD>
<P>Glurnz, a small town, but pleasantly situated.</P>
<P>Matsch, in Latin Amasia, the capital of a seig∣niory, which had formerly counts of its own.</P>
<P>This quarter contains several other seigniories, in which are divers cloisters and castles.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="259" REF="2630"/>
<HEAD>In the QUARTER of ETSCH the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Meran, on the river Passer, formerly the capital of the county, and still a handsome town, and a place of good trade, lying thirty miles south of Inspruck. Near it formerly stood a town, called Maja, or Urbs Magiensis, which was overwhelm∣ed by the fall of a mountain, now well inhabited, and yielding a good wine, called Hochhutter.</P>
<P>Tyrol, antiently Terioli, a small market-town, whence the country takes its name. It stands in a pleasant valley, and contains a stately antient castle, in which resides a burgrave, who has a large ju∣risdiction. Its neighbourhood is noted for a good wine, called Kirchlberger wine.</P>
<P>Zenonberg, a citadel, in which the antient so∣vereigns of Tyrol often resided.</P>
<P>Trautmansdorff, a citadel and seat, whence the counts of Trautmansdorff derive their title.</P>
<P>Bozen, in Italian Bolzano, an open, but large and populous market-town, on the river Eysak. It is famous for its four yearly fairs, much fre∣quented by Italian and German merchants, and for some good wines.</P>
<P>Salurn, a market-town, and the capital of a seigniory.</P>
<P>Arch, or Arco, a small town on the river Sarca, and the capital of a county.</P>
<P>Rovereith, otherwise Roveredo, in Latin Robe∣retum. Here is a strong citadel, with a manufac∣ture of silk, and a considerable trade. The wine which is made hereabouts, and towards Trent, is called Goccia d'oro, or Golden-drops.</P>
<P>One of the dales, or vallies, in this quarter, is called Sugan, in Latin Vallis Euganea, from its antient inhabitants the Euganei. At the extremi∣ty
<PB N="260" REF="2640"/>
of this valley, on the borders of the territory of Venice, is the pass of Kofel, in Italian Covelo, and in Latin Claustrum. One side of it is formed by the steep shore of the river Brent, and the other by a prodigious high rock, which rises up like a wall, and has a fort upon it, with a spring. In the fort is a small garrison, which must be wound up and let down by ropes; and the pass below is so narrow, that two carriages can scarce go a-breast. Not far from hence is a lazaretto, in which travel∣lers, in the time of a plague, must perform qua∣rantine. The situation of it is very lonesome and romantic, amidst cliffs and mountains, of an un∣common height. In this quarter are also some good iron mines.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The QUARTER of EISACK,</HEAD>
<P>This quarter, which was antiently inhabited by the Hisarci, contains a great many jurisdictions, seig∣niories, and citadels, besides some cloisters and mar∣ket-towns. Near Wiltau, Wilthan, Wilden, or Wiltheim, a famous cloister of Praemonstratenses, stood antiently the Roman town of Veldidena, which was reckoned the capital of all Rhaetia.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The QUARTER of PUSTERTHAL,</HEAD>
<P>This quarter, which came to the house of Austria in the year 1500, on the decease of the last count of Gorz, contains fifteen parishes, two boroughs, three market-towns, above thirty citadels, and a∣bout forty villages. Here are also several warm baths, a good breed of cattle, and plenty of corn. A part of it belongs to the bishopric of Brisgau: The only places meriting particular notice are,</P>
<P>The citadel of Ehrenburg, near which, on the Venetian frontier, is the strong citadel of Peitlstein,
<PB N="261" REF="2650"/>
in Italian Bottestano, or Putestagno. Not far from hence the river Piave, in Latin Plavis, and Anas∣sus, has its source, running immediately into the Venetian territories.</P>
<P>Welsperg, a mountain, which gives title of count to the antient house of Welsperg.</P>
<P>Innichen, a market-town, antiently called Agun∣tum, near which is the spring-head of the Drab or Drau.</P>
<P>Tilliach, or Dilliach, a small place, in the juris∣diction of which rises the Gayl, in Latin Julia, and Zea, on the high mountains, called the Julian Alps.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The AUSTRIAN SEIGNIORIES be∣fore the ARLBERG.</HEAD>
<P>These seigniories constitute a part of the antient Rhaetia, and the Arlberg, which separates them from Tyrol, a part of the antiently famous Mons Rhaetius. Under them are comprehended the county of Bregenz, the county of Sonneberg, the county of Bludenz, or Pludenz, the county of Montfort, or Faldkirch, and the seigniory of Hoheneck.</P>
<P>The county of Bregenz, which had once counts of its own, but came afterwards to the house of Austria by purchase, is very woody, and the only place of any note in it is, Bregenz, a small town, giving name to it, and containing a citadel. Near it are some iron works, and a strong pass, called Bregenz-Claus, with Mehreraa, in Latin Augia∣major, or Brigantia, a fine abbey of Benedictines.</P>
<P>The county of Sonneberg takes its name from a citadel.</P>
<P>The county of Bludenz, or Pludenz, takes its name from a small town, with a citadel, on the river Ill.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="2660"/>
The county of Montfort, or Feldkirch, takes the first of these names from a small but well-built town on the river Ill; and the second from a ruinous citadel, where the antient counts used to reside, and from which they took their title.</P>
<P>The seigniory of Hoheneck, takes its name from a citadel seated on a mountain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The AUSTRIAN TERRITORIES in SWABIA.</HEAD>
<P>These territories, on account of which the arch∣dukes stile themselves princes of Swabia, and which, towards the expences of the military establishment, contribute annually an hundred and twenty thou∣sand florins, comprehend, the imperial landvog∣tey in Swabia; the town of Costnitz, Costanz, or Constance, with its territory; the margravate or marquisate of Burgau; the county of Kirchberg, or Weissenhorn; the county of Hohenberg; the landgravate of Nellenburg; the Austrian Brisgaw; the four forest towns, lying on the Rhine; the landvogtey of Ortenau; with several small towns and seigniories.</P>
<P>The extent of the landvogtey of Swabia cannot be easily determined, being so much intersected by other territories. It is divided into the Upper and Low∣er, and is tolerably fertile, producing corn, and in some places wine. The peasants here are little better than slaves, having hardly any thing that they can call their own, and no other religion but the Roman catholic is tolerated. The only place in the territory of any note is,</P>
<P>Altorf, a market-town, endowed with consider∣able privileges and immunities, and the seat of the chief tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="2670"/>
Constance, Costanz, or Cosnitz, in Latin Constan∣tia, an antient city on the lake to which it gives name, was formerly an imperial city, but Ferdinand I. in the year 1549, brought it under the power of the house of Austria. It is well fortified, and the see of a bishop, who does not, however, reside in it, but at Mersberg. Diets of the empire have been often held in this city; but of all the assem∣blies held in it, that stiled the council of Constance, is the most famous. It was called by the emperor Sigismund, when there was a great schism in the church, and no less than three popes, one set up by the Italians, a second by the French, and a third by the Spaniards; who were all three de∣posed, and a new one, viz. Martin V. chosen. This council likewise condemned the doctrines of Wickliff, John Huss, and Jerom of Prague, causing the bones of the first to be dug up and burnt, and the two last to be burnt alive, though the former had a safe-conduct granted him by the emperor. This was the greatest oecumeni∣cal synod that was ever held, and continued from the year 1414 to 1418. It is said there were an hundred thousand foreigners in and about Con∣stance at that time. Of these the ecclesiastics, with their retinues, made upwards of eighteen thousand. There were also, it is said, three hundred and forty-six jugglers and stage-players, and fifteen hundred harlots. Some will be apt to wonder, how the latter could find any custom or encouragement, on so so∣lemn an occasion. The council, one would ima∣gine, must have had a great deal of spare time on their hands; for, though they sat several years, all they did was the deposing three infallible popes, setting up a new one, and burning two honest men, because they had the audaciousness and impiety to attempt to shake off the yoke of ecclesiastical ty∣ranny,
<PB N="264" REF="2680"/>
to open the eyes of the laity, and to expose the monstrous corruptions and impositions of the church of Rome. These councils were never of any real service to Christianity and true religion; they only served to rivet the chains of the laity, and to ruin and extirpate all those who had the courage and honesty to attempt to break them. We had al∣most forgot to mention that infamous canon made here, namely, that faith is not to be kept with he∣retics, nor those suspected of heresy, which was neither more or less than establishing villainy and perfidiousness by law; for what was that they called heresy, against which these spiritual thunders were levelled, but integrity, honour, virtue, and reli∣gion, every thing, in fact, that is noble, generous, great, and good? But to return to Constance. It is a very pretty city, pleasantly situated on the south side of the lake, where the Rhine issues out of it, three hundred and twenty-five miles west of Vienna. Some ascribe the founding of it to Con∣stantine the Great, or his father Constantius Chlo∣rus; but others think it more antient. The house of Austria, under the title of protector, maintains a governor and garrison here, and allows the city most of its antient privileges; for, as we observed already, it was once a free imperial city; but on refusing to conform to the Interim, a religious re∣gulation formed by Charles V. it was besieged, taken, and subjected to the Austrian family. A considerable trade is carried on here by means of the lake, and the Rhine which runs out of the lake, about a musket-shot below the town. The build∣ing, where the above council met, is still shewn to strangers, together with the wicket through which they conveyed victuals to the venerable fathers, who composed it. The bishop has no authority at present in the town.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="2690"/>
The margravate of Burgau lies between the Danube and the Lech. It came to the house of Austria in 1283, upon the death of its last mar∣grave Henry. There are only two towns in it of any note, viz.</P>
<P>Burgau, and Gunzburg. The former is the capi∣tal, has an old castle, and stands on the river Min∣del: the latter stands on the Danube, is a great thoroughfare, and has a magnificent castle, the re∣sidence of the Austrian governor.</P>
<P>The county of Kirchberg, or Weissenhorn, is possessed as a male-fief by the Raymund branch of the noble family of Fuggers. The only place in it worth mentioning is,</P>
<P>Weissenhorn, a small town and citadel on the river Roth.</P>
<P>The county of Hohenberg was purchased in the year 1381, by the Austrian duke Leopold, of count Rudolph, for sixty-six thousand florins. It contains several small towns, cloisters, and castles.</P>
<P>The landgravate of Nellenburg came to the house of Austria by purchase. It is about twenty-seven miles long, and twelve broad, and the inha∣bitants are Calvinists, under the protection of the Swiss cantons.</P>
<P>The Austrian Brisgaw came to the house of Austria, by purchase, in the year 1367. The prin∣cipal places in it are,</P>
<P>Friburg, the capital, which is situate on the river Treisam, on the edge of the Black-Forest, and was founded in 1118, by duke Berthold of Zahringen, and endowed with many immunities. It was former∣ly
<PB N="266" REF="2700"/>
very strong, and had stood many sieges; but its fortifications were demolished by the French, in 1745. The town is large, populous, and wealthy, having an university, a college of Jesuits, and se∣veral cloisters. The lapidaries here are famous for polishing the granates, jaspers, and other precious stones, that are found in Lorrain and the neigh∣bouring countries. The tower of the great church is so high, so curiously carved and constructed, that there is nothing of that kind in Germany to be compared to it, except that of Strasburg.</P>
<P>Brisack, or Old Brisack, to distinguish it from the New, which was built and strongly fortified by the French on the other side the Rhine, in Al∣sace. Old Brisack came to the house of Austria by mortgage, and was once an imperial city. It was reckoned very strong until 1741, when its fortifications were razed, by order of the queen of Hungary.</P>
<P>Neuburg on the Rhine, which was formerly an imperial town, but in the fourteenth century fell under the dominion of the house of Austria.</P>
<P>Zahringen, a desolate castle near Freyburg, from which the antient dukes of Zahringen took their title.</P>
<P>The abbey of St. Blase, whose abbot, in 1747, was made a prince of the empire. He is also hereditary arch - aulic - chaplain of the house of Austria, in the Anterior Austrian countries, but subject, in spirituals, to the bishop of Con∣stance.</P>
<P>The four forest towns are Rheinfelden, Seckin∣gen, Laufenburg, and Waldshut. The first is the capital of a county, and was once a free impe∣rial city, but was mortgaged in 1410, by the em∣peror Lewis of Bavaria, to the dukes of Austria.
<PB N="267" REF="2710"/>
Hard by is the village of Kaisars-Augst, on the Rhine, where antiently stood the Augusta Raura∣corum. The second is a small town, and held in fee of its abbess. The third is the capital of an antient county, well fortified, and seated on both sides the Rhine. It is held as a fief of the foundation of Seckingen, and came to the house of Austria in 1409, when the line of the counts of Habsburg-Laufenburg became extinct. The fourth is a small but strong town, being, as its German name imports, a key to the Black Forest. It was built and fortified, in 1249, by Albert, count of Habsburg, who granted it se∣veral privileges.</P>
<P>The landvogtey of Ortenau belongs partly to the house of Austria, and partly to the imme∣diate imperial knighthood of the circuit of the Ortenau.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of TRENT.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric lies in the county of Tyrol, to the diets of which the bishop sends deputies, bearing also a share of its taxes and imposts; yet, as an immediate prince of the empire, he has both seat and voice at the diets thereof, and also at those of the circle of Austria. The emperor, as count of Tyrol, is protector of the bishop; and, when extraordinary taxes are imposed by the empire, answers for him. In spirituals, the bishop is subject to the archbishop of Gorz. The bishopric is about sixty miles long, and forty where broadest, having the river Adige running through it from north to south, and producing a good pale-red wine, oil, fruit, and pasture, but not much corn. German and Italian are the languages commonly spoken in it. The bishop, who has a revenue of about for∣ty thousand crowns, is chosen by the chapter, consisting of eighteen canons, out of their own body. Several princes, both of Germany and Italy, pay him homage and quit-rents, for estates which they hold of his see. The inhabitants are
<PB N="269" REF="2730"/>
generally bigotted Roman-catholics, and in their persons, air, and manners, resemble the Italians more than the Germans. The places of most note in the bishopric are,</P>
<P>Trent, its capital, in Latin Tridentum, which name it is supposed to have had from three mountains, or peaks, that hang over it, resembling three teeth. It stands sixty-five miles south of Inspruck, as ma∣ny west of Venice, two hundred and fifty-five south-west of Vienna and north-west of Rome, on the river Adige. Ever since the year 1377 it hath been subject to its own bishop, who is nevertheless a vassal to the house of Austria, as counts of Tyrol. The high mountains about it make the air excessive hot in summer, and cold in winter, and expose the town to inundations, the torrents that descend from the mountains being sometimes so impetuous, as to roll large pieces of rock along with them into the town. It is not very large, but pretty popu∣lous, is defended by an old castle and a single wall, and contains several stately palaces, churches, and re∣ligious houses. The cathedral, dedicated to St. Vigil, is a magnificent Gothic structure. The episcopal pa∣lace is a large old-fashioned building, but adorned with some fine paintings. The church of St. Mary Major is noted for a prodigious large organ, which will counterfeit all sorts of musical instruments, to∣gether with the singing of birds, the cries of several beasts, and the sound of drums and trumpets, so exactly that it is hard to distinguish them; but it is still more noted for the famous council of Trent, which was held in it, concerning the reformation, &amp;c. at which four thousand persons of a public character, laymen or ecclesiastics, assisted. The first eighteen years nothing material was done; but at last the pope and cardinals got the ascendant, which made the Hungarian bishops say, "That
<PB N="270" REF="2740"/>
the Holy Ghost had been sent thither from Rome in a cloak-bag." However, after sitting, debating, and deliberating so long, not only the protestants, but the whole German and French nations, refused to receive its decrees. Near the town, on the A∣dige, is an old tower, called the Green Tower, in∣to which the river used to be conveyed formerly, for drowning such of the clergy as were convicted of having been too familiar with their neighbours wives and daughters. The clocks, it is said, strike twelve here, and at Basil in Swisserland, an hour before the true meridian or mid-day, and that this was owing to the councils which sat there. The in∣habitants, who are partly Germans and partly Ita∣lians, Dr. Nicholson represents as friendly and hu∣mane, very obliging to strangers, and faithful to their promises.</P>
<P>Reif, in Latin Ripa, in Italian Reva, a small town on the Lago de Garda, defended by two castles. Here is a celebrated image of the Virgin, and a considerable trade. In the neighbourhood grow excellent lemons and oranges.</P>
<P>The river Brenta, in Latin Meduacus, and the Sarca, in Latin Mincius, have their source in this bishopric. The mountain called the Nonsberg, in Latin Anania or Anaunia, is very fertile, and full of villages, citadels, and seats of many noble and antient families. In particular here is the citadel of Spaur, whence the counts of that name derive their name and origin; and the market-town of Glosz, whence sprung the noble family of that name, who are hereditary chamberlains of Tyrol. The valley also called the Sulzthal, in Latin Vallis Solis, i. e. the Valley of the Sun, is very fruitful.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="271" REF="2750"/>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of BRIXEN.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is about forty-five miles long, and thirty broad. Tho' it lies among the Alps, it is very fruitful, especially in excellent wine. The bishop has an income of about thirty or thirty-five thousand crowns, and is a prince of the empire, and a state of the circle of Austria, but subject, in spirituals, to the archbishop of Salzburg, and, in temporals, to the house of Austria, as counts of Tyrol, to the diets of which he sends deputies, bearing also a share of its taxes and imposts; but with respect to the extraordinary taxes of the em∣pire, the house of Austria answers for them. The chapter consists of eighteen canons, of which nine are nobles, and has a representative at the assem∣blies of the county of Tyrol. The principal places in the bishopric are,</P>
<P>Brixen, the capital, in Latin Briximum, or Brixina, in the Italian Brissanone, standing at the foot of mount Brinner, on the Eysack, where the Rienz joins it, in a fine country, abounding with vineyards, and only a post-stage from the territo∣ries of Venice. It was formerly an imperial city. It has a castle, two convents, a handsome episco∣pal palace and cathedral, two other churches, and some spacious squares. The houses in this town are generally well-built, uniform, and curiously painted on the outside. In its neighbourhood are mineral waters. Mount Brinner, at the foot of which it lies, tho' very high, and covered with snow for nine months together, is cultivated and inhabited to the very top, where is a post-house, a tavern, and chapel. The passage over it is very difficult and tiresome; and when it snows, or rains, im∣practicable. The people here are staunch Roman
<PB N="272" REF="2760"/>
catholics, and the principal objects of their wor∣ship are, the Virgin Mary and St. Christopher; the latter of whom is painted in all their houses, and the former has many chapels on the road dedi∣cated to her.</P>
<P>Seben, Clausen, and Branneggen, or Brauneck, small towns. The two first are situated on the Ey∣sack. To the bishop, besides this bishopric, be∣longs also the lordship of Vildes, and the isle of Notre Dame, in the lake called the Frauensee, in Carniola, which were granted to this see, in the eleventh century, by the emperor Henry II.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of CHUR, or COIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric, by the Germans, is usually rec∣koned in the circle of Austria, and an immediate state of the empire; tho' the contrary is maintain∣ed by the Grison League of the House of God. Be that as it will, the bishop, tho' he furnishes no contingent, calls himself, and is acknowledged to be, a prince of the empire, and sends a deputy to the diets, when he pleases. Neither he, or his chapter, pay much regard to the pretensions of the House of God, particularly to this, That no bishop ought to be chosen without their privity and consent. As a bishop, he is under the arch∣bishop of Mentz; and tho' he is himself a Roman catholic, yet most of the inhabitants of the lands subject to his temporal jurisdiction, are protestants. His chapter consists of twenty-four canons, of whom some are nobles. Both he and they reside on an eminence near the town of Chur, called Hoff, where a is spacious and well-built castle. He has the right of coinage, and is possessed of several fine estates and fiefs, not only among the Grisons, but in some foreign countries, as Tyrol and Alsace.
<PB N="273" REF="2770"/>
Before the Reformation, he had also some jurisdic∣tion over the city of Coire. His title is thus: By the grace of God, elected bishop of Chur, or Coire, prince of the Holy Roman empire, lord of Fursten∣burg, Furstenau, &amp;c. The see is very antient, and its power, both temporal and spiritual, before the Reformation, was very great. At present its episcopal, or spiritual jurisdiction, extends partly into the hereditary countries of the house of Au∣stria, and partly into Swisserland.</P>
<P>The Teutonic Order has two bailiwics in the circle of Austria, on account of which it is reckon∣ed a state thereof, namely, one in the archduchy of Austria, and another on the Etsch, and the Ge∣birge in Tyrol.</P>
<P>Of the places and estates in the Brisgau belong∣ing to the order of St. John, we have given some account under the circle of the Upper Rhine, to which they are more usually reckoned to belong, tho' the Austrians account them a part of this circle.</P>
<P>The little seigniory of Trasp, belonging to the prince of Dietrichstein, lies on the borders of Ty∣rol, in the valley of Engedein. The emperor Leopold made a present of it, together with the supreme jurisdiction, to prince Ferdinand-Joseph of Dietrichstein, who on that account, in 1668, obtained a seat and voice in the college of princes, at the diet of the empire.</P>

<HEAD>BOHEMIA.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its NAME, BOUNDARIES, and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>BOHEMIA, in German Boierheim, Boiheim, Boheim, and Bohmen, takes its name from its antient inhabitants, the Boii, whose seat or a∣bode it signifies. Bohemia Proper is bounded to the north by Misnia, Lusatia, and Silesia; to the west by the circle of the Erzgebirge, the Voight∣land, the margravate of Culinbach, and the Up∣per-Palatinate; to the south by Bavaria and Au∣stria; and to the east by Moravia, Silesia, and the county of Glatz. Its extent is about nine hundred square German miles, or near four thousand English.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, AIR, SOIL, and PRODUE.</HEAD>
<P>Bohemia is surrounded by high mountains and woods, and every province divided from another by a chain of mountains. It enjoys but an indif∣ferent air, for tho' it is warm and pleasant, it is not accounted very wholesome; and this is sup∣posed to be partly owing to the large thick woods with which it abounds. The soil is said to be rich in general, tho' in some places sandy. It is well watered by the rivers Muldaw, Egra, Oder, Vis∣tula, Moraw, Teyn, and Igla. It produces corn, buck-wheat, and millet, fruits, excellent hops, saffron, ginger, calamus, a sort of pannick, or fox∣tail, good red wines, and pasture, flax, wool, and timber. They have a strong large breed of horses, great numbers of which are often bought up to remount the French cavalry. Its mountains are
<PB N="275" REF="2790"/>
the richest in Europe in gold, silver, precious stones, copper, quicksilver, iron, lead, tin, sulphur, and saltpetre. This country yields also terta sigillata, or sealed earth, Muscovy-glass, stone, or pit-coal, alum, vitriolic water, marble, mineral waters, and hot baths. Lastly, here are numerous herds of cattle, plenty of game and wild-fowl, with bears, lynxes, wolves, foxes, martens, badgers, beavers, otters, and in the rivers and ponds are well-tasted fish of all sorts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>Their principal manufacture is linen, of which they export great quantities, together with corn, malt, hops, and mineral waters. They have also considerable manufactures of copper, iron, glass, earthen-ware, and paper, of which also a part is exported.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Bohemia, for a considerable time, was governed by dukes, and afterwards by kings, who were li∣mited in their power, and elected by the states; tho' they usually kept to the family of the deceased monarch. After the battle of the White Moun∣tain, in 1620, the crown was made hereditary in the Austrian family; so that, from that time, the states have had nothing more to do with respect to the right of succession. The states, indeed, are summoned every year by the command of the em∣press-queen, and meet at Prague; but it is only for form's sake. They consist of the clergy, nobi∣lity, gentry, and representatives of the towns. Here a commissioner from the sovereign lays be∣fore them the necessity of granting such supplies as the court demands, which usually amounts to a
<PB N="276" REF="2800"/>
very great sum; and these are granted, without hesitation, or examination: only they sometimes express their concern at the absence of their prince, and seem grieved, that their country is exhausted to enrich the Austrians, for whom they have an im∣placable aversion. The peasants here are bond∣men to their lords, and to the hard yoke which galls them is doubtless owing, in a great measure, both their perverse obstinate disposition, and their indolence; the latter of which, among other things, is evident from the wretched condition of the vil∣lages, which, tho' wood is to be sound here in great plenty, and building is far from being ex∣pensive, are very mean and despicably. In the year 1679, a great part of them took up arms on ac∣count of the heavy bondage they laboured under. The clergy are composed of the archbishop of Prague, several bishops, provosts, and abbots, besides the inserior clergy. The nobility are di∣vided into princes, counts, and barons; and the next degrees to these are knights, burghers, hus∣bandmen, and peasants. Bohemia is divided into twelve circles; but the city of Prague, on account of its dignity, is not included in any circle. Each of these circles has two headmen or captains, one out of the state of lords, and one out of the state of knights. The county of Glatz was ceded in the year 1742 to the king of Prussia, and by him add∣ed to Silesia. Bohemia is generally considered as a part of Germany, but with very little reason, for it is not in any of the nine circles, neither doth it contribute any thing towards the forces, or re∣venues of the empire, or is subject to any of its laws.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="277" REF="2810"/>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The language of the Bohemians is a dialect of the Sclavonic, but somewhat harsher than that of their neighbours, who speak the same language, as the latter change the consonants more into vowels. Most people of fashion, however, through their intercourse with the court of Vienna, speak High Dutch, or German; with which the language of the common people is also intermixed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Bohemians are supposed to have received the Christian faith so early as the sixth century; but if not then, it is certain they did in the ninth, and their religion was that of the Greek church, till Boleslaus, surnamed the Good, introduced po∣pery among them. John Huss and Jerom of Prague were burnt at the council of Constance, in the fifteenth century, for endeavouring to bring about a reformation in religion. This occasioned a bloody war, which continued for many years; but the Hussites were worsted, and, in 1547, the greater part of them was obliged to quit their country; upon which they withdrew to the neigh∣bouring dominions, especially Poland and Prussia. However, when Luther appeared, great numbers of the Bohemians embraced his doctrine, and these at first had a toleration; but afterwards, being persecuted, they took up arms, and, in 1618, chose Frederic V. elector Palatine, for their king: but the war ended unfortunately, both for the king and the protestant Bohemians. In consequence of this, they were deprived, in 1627, of all their rights and privileges; and such as would not submit to the Roman catholic church, were compelled to quit the country. However, there are a few Lutherans
<PB N="278" REF="2820"/>
still remaining here; but they are obliged to be upon their guard, and to conceal themselves as much as possible. The Jews at Prague are more indulged, and have a very open toleration. The archbishop of Prague is born legate of the holy apostolic see of Rome, and crowns the king of Bo∣hemia. He is also a prince of the Holy Roman empire, though he has no seat in the diets, primate of the kingdom, and perpetual chancellor of the university of Prague. His suffragans are the bishops of Leutmeritz, and Konigingratz. The government of the church and clergy is vested in the archiepiscopal consistory, from which an appeal lies either to the queen or pope.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenues are raised by the states of the king∣dom, who are assembled annually at Prague, to provide such sums as the empress demands of them, over and above the customs and duties to which she is entitled by her prerogative. The revenue of Bohemia is said to amount to near one million sterling a-year. The wealth and grandeur of the nobility form a very striking and affecting contrast with the poverty and slavery of the peasants. The latter, in a rich and plentiful country, are starving, both their persons and effects being entirely at the mercy of their lords, without whose permission they cannot so much as earn a morsel of bread to them∣selves. The standing militia of the Austrian he∣reditary countries is twenty-four thousand men, towards which Bohemia furnishes nine thousand. In time of war these serve to fill up the marching regiments.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="279" REF="2830"/>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the BOHEMIANS.</HEAD>
<P>The inhabitants are a mixture of Sclavonians and Germans; the former of which live in the vil∣lages, and are slaves. The inhabitants of the towns are not fond either of arms, arts, or trade; but prefer an idle, indolent life. They are generally of a large size, and well-set, subtle, courageous, and true to their words. Their gentry are natu∣rally brave, and more inclined to arms than arts. They are of an open and agreeable conversation; but the boors, or peasants, are said to be a brutish, thievish generation, so that it is dange∣rous going into the country, without being well attended; and even in the towns, it is not very safe being abroad in the streets after sun-set. The whole nation is charged with intemperance and credulity; but such charges must not be taken in their utmost latitude, nor without many excep∣tions.</P>
<P>Learning is at a low ebb among them; tho' they have one university, namely, that of Prague, which is under the inspection of the Jesuits, toge∣ther with some academies, colleges, and schools.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE TOWNS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Bohemia being divided into twelve circles, ex∣clusive of Prague, and the territory of the Eger, we shall first describe that city, and then the chief of those in the several circles, and the territory of the Eger.</P>
<P>Prague, the capital of the whole kingdom, is situate in 14 deg. 40 min. of long. and 50 deg. 5 min. of lat. an hundred and twenty miles north-east of Ratisbon, an hundred and forty-three east of Nuremberg, seventy-four south of Dresden, an hundred and forty north-west of Vienna, an hun∣dred
<PB N="280" REF="2840"/>
and fifty south of Berlin, and an hundred and forty-seven north-east of Munich. It stands on both sides the Mulda, over which there is a stone bridge; but the river, though of great breadth here, is nevertheless shallow, and not naviga∣ble. On both sides the bridge are several statues, and, among others, that of St. John of Nepomuck, whom king Wenzel caused to be thrown from the bridge into the river, for venturing to reprove him upon some occasion; but in 1720 he was canonized as a saint, and is at present held in such veneration in Bohemia, that all the other saints seem, on his account, to be forgotten. The houses of this city are wholly built of stone, and consist for the most part of three stories. Here are near an hundred churches and chapels, and about forty cloisters. The number of its Christian inhabitants is said to be seventy thousand, and of Jews about twelve thousand. The principal branch of its trade consists in brewing of beer. It is divided into the Old and New Towns, and that called the small side; the former lying on the east side of the Mulda, and the latter on the west. The whole is about twelve miles in circumference, and but thinly inhabited. The fortifications are not of great importance, as it may be flanked and raked on all sides. However, the king of Prussia was not able to make himself master of it in the late war, though he almost destroyed it with his bombs, &amp;c. It stands in a pleasant and fruitful country, in the midst of gardens, fine fields, palaces, and pleasure-houses. It hath suffered greatly by sieges, and hath been often taken and plundered. The university was founded by Charles IV. in the year 1347. The Jesuits here have two very large col∣leges, with a fine library and observatory. In 1409, when John Huss was rector of the university, there were no less than forty-four thousand stu∣dents,
<PB N="281" REF="2850"/>
and when the emperor Charles V. would have retrenched their privileges, twenty-four thou∣sand are said to have left it in one week, and sixteen thousand in a short time after. The Jews have the trade of this city almost entirely in their own hands. They deal in all sorts of commodities, especially the precious stones found in the Bohemian mines, and, by receiving all old-fashioned things in payment, quite ruin the Christian handicraftsmen. In 1744 they nar∣rowly escaped being expelled the kingdom, having been suspected of corresponding with the Prussians, when they made themselves masters of the city. The grand prior of the order of Malta, for Bohe∣mia, Moravia, and Silesia, resides here; and the church and hospital of the Holy Ghost is the seat of the general and grand-masters of the holy order of Knights of the Cross with the red Star, residing in the above-mentioned countries, and in Poland and Hungary. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Veit, and adorned with many magnificent tombs of great personages. On Ratschin-hill, in Upper-Prague, most of the nobility have houses, and the emperor a very magnificent palace, with a summer-house, commanding one of the finest prospects in the world. Here the tribunals of the regency meet, and the halls, galleries, and other apartments, are adorned with a multitude of noble pictures. The great hall, where the coronation-feast is kept, is said to be the largest of the kind in Europe, next to that of Westminster. The castle stands on the above-mentioned mountain, called Ratschin, or the White Mountain, and is very strong. It was from a window of this castle that the emperor's counsellors were thrown in 1618; but tho' they fell from a great height, yet they were not kill∣ed, nor indeed much hurt. On the same moun∣tain stands also the archiepiscopal palace. In the New Town is an arsenal, and a religious founda∣tion for ladies, called the Free Temporal Eng∣lish

Foundation, over which an abbess presides. In the lesser side or town, the counts Colloredo and Wallenstein have very magnificent palaces and gardens. The stables of the latter are very grand, the racks being of steel, and the mangers of marble, with a marble pillar betwixt each horse; over each horse also is placed his pic∣ture, as big as the life. Though the inhabitants of Prague in general are poor, and their shops but meanly furnished; yet, it is said, there are few cities where the nobility and gentry are more wealthy, and live in greater state. Here is much gaming, masquerading, feasting, and very splendid public balls, with an Italian opera, and assem∣blies in the houses of the quality every night. On the White Mountain, near the town, was fought the battle, in which the protestants, with the elector Palatine Frederic, their king, were de∣feated. The lustres and drinking glasses made here of Bohemian chrystal are much esteemed, and vended all over Europe. These chrystals are also polished by the Jews, and set in rings, ear-pendants, and shirt-buttons. The chief tribunal consists of twelve stadtholders, at the head of whom is the great burgrave, governor of the kingdom and city, immediatly under the emperor, and the chan∣cery of Bohemia.</P>

<P>Wary, or Carlsbad, i. e. Charles's-bath, in Latin Thermae Carolinae, a royal borough, celebrated for its baths and medicinal waters. They are of two sorts, differing both in heat and strength; the one being boiling-hot, and the other little more than lukewarm. The source of them is in the middle of a river, formed by torrents from the neighbouring mountains, whose waters are exceed∣ing cold, yet those of the mineral springs, espe∣cially of the hottest, are seen to smoke in the river. They are recommended for various disorders, par∣ticularly the gravel and barrenness in women, and are both drank and bathed in, sometimes by the same persons, and at one and the same time. Their virtues have been described by Hoffman and other physicians. It was in the year 1370, during the reign of Charles IV. that they first began to be used. The town itself is but a dirty place, inhabited chiefly by armourers, and other artificers in iron.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Circle of RACOWNITZ.</HEAD>
<P>This circle, comprehending, since the year 1714, that of Slan or Slansko, is in some parts woody and mountainous, and in others fruitful in corn, containing an hundred and six seigniories, estates, and seats. The places of most note are,</P>

</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Territory of EGER.</HEAD>
<P>This territory has its name from its capital. It is no part, properly speaking, of Bohemia, tho' it hath long belonged to the kings thereof, namely, since it was mortgaged, in the year 1322, by the em∣peror Lewis IV. to John, king of Bohemia, for forty thousand marks. The only place of any note in it is,</P>
<P>Cheb, Eger, or Egra, a beautiful and well for∣tified town, situated on the river Eger or Egra, whence both it and the territory have their names, ninety miles west of Prague. Frederick I. made it an imperial city, in 1179, for its fidelity to him against the duke of Bavaria. In consequence of this, the town has the privilege of coining money; and from the judicial sentences of its council, there lies no appeal, but to the king. Here are three cloisters and a college of Jesuits, and in the
<PB N="293" REF="2970"/>
neighbourhood is an acid spring, which is purga∣tive, and famous for removing disorders in the eyes, ears, and other parts of the head. Accord∣ingly, it is sent to all parts in flasks, sealed with the arms of the town. Here is an arsenal, with several cloisters and churches, courts of judicature, hospitals, baths, and store houses for corn. In the neighbourhood also are mines of silver and gold; but they do not seem to be wrought at present. In 1742 it was taken by the French; but, in 1743, surrendered to the queen of Hungary's forces.</P>

</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MORAVIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS marquisate derives the name of Mahern, as it is called by the Germans, and of Mo∣rawa, as it is called by the natives, from the river of that name, which rises in the mountains of the county of Glatz, and passes through the middle of it. It is bounded to the south by Austria; to the north by Glatz and Silesia; to the west by Bohe∣mia; and to the east by Silesia and Hungary: be∣ing about one hundred and twenty miles in length, and one hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>A great part of this country is over-run with woods and mountains, where the air is very cold, but much wholesomer than in the low grounds, which are full of bogs and lakes. The mountains, in general, are barren; but the more champaign parts tolerably fertile, yielding corn, with plenty of hemp and flax, good saffron, and pasture. Nor
<PB N="294" REF="2980"/>
is it altogether destitute of wine, red and white, fruits, and garden stuff. Moravia also abounds in horses, black cattle, sheep, and goats. In the woods and about the lakes there is plenty of wild fowl, game, venison, bees, honey, hares, foxes, wolves, beavers, and a beast of prey, called Rysowe, about the size of a dog, having its belly and feet spotted, and leaping suddenly on its prey, from rocks or trees. In this country are likewise quarries of marble, bastard diamonds, amethysts, alum, iron, sulphur, salt-petre, and vitriol, with wholesome mineral waters, and warm springs; but salt is imported. Its rivers, of which the March, Morawa, or Morau, are the chief, abound with trout, crayfish, barbels, cels, jack, perch, and many other sorts of fish.</P>
<P>The language of the inhabitants is a dialect of the Sclavonic, differing little from the Bohemian; but the nobility and citizens speak German and French.</P>
<P>Moravia was antiently inhabited by the Quadi, who were driven out by the Sclavi. Its kings, who were once powerful and independent, after∣wards became dependent on, and tributary to the German emperors and kings. At last, in the year 908, the Moravian kingdom was parcelled out a∣mong the Germans, Poles, and Hungarians. In 1086, that part of it properly called Moravia, was declared a marquisate by the German king, Henry IV. and united with Bohemia, to whose dukes and kings, it hath ever since been subject. Tho' it is not very populous, it contains about forty-two greater or walled towns, seventeen smaller or open towns, and one hundred and ninety-eight market-towns, besides villages, &amp;c. The states of the country consist of the clergy, lords, knights, and burgesses; and the diets, when summoned by the regency, are held at Brunn. The marquisate is
<PB N="295" REF="2990"/>
still governed by its own peculiar constitutions, under the directorium in publicis &amp; camera∣libus, and the supreme judicatory at Vienna. It is divided into six circles, each of which has its captain, and contributes, to its sovereign, about one∣third of what is exacted of Bohemia. Towards the expences of the military establishment of the whole Austrian hereditary countries, its yearly quota is one million eight hundred and fifty-six thousand four hundred and ninety florins. Seven regiments of foot, one of cuirassiers, and one of dragoons, are usually quartered in it.</P>
<P>Christianity was planted in this country in the ninth century, and the inhabitants continued at∣tached to the church of Rome till the fifteenth, when they espoused the doctrine of John Huss, and threw off popery; but after the defeat of the elector Palatine, whom they had chosen king, as well as the Bohemians, the emperor Ferdinand II. re-established popery. However, there are still some protestants in Moravia; and not long since a set of enthusiasts, called Hernhutters, or Mora∣vian Brethren, headed by one of the counts of Zinzindorf, appeared among them, who, at first, met with great encouragement in England, but af∣terwards, when their tenets and practices came to be better known, fell into contempt; though they have still some followers among the lower sort. The bishop of Olmutz, who stands immediately under the pope, is at the head of the ecclesiastics in this country. The supreme ecclesiastical juris∣diction, under the bishop, is vested in a consistory. In Moravia, Poland, and Bohemia, the priests are called Knez, which, in the Sclavonic, signifies a prince; and, though originally used only as a compliment, shews the abject submission and re∣spect paid to them.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="3000"/>
The commerce of this country is inconsiderable. Of what they have, Brunn enjoys the principal part. At Iglau and Trebitz are manufactures of cloth, paper, gunpowder, &amp;c. There are also some iron-works and glass houses in the country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Moravia, in general, are open-hearted, not easy to be provoked or pacified, obedient to their masters, true to their promises, but credulous of old prophecies, and much ad∣dicted to drinking; tho' neither such sots, or bigots, as they are represented by some geographers. The boors, indeed, upon the river Hanak, are said to be a thievish, unpolished, brutal race. The sciences now begin to lift up their heads a little among the Moravians, the university of Olmutz having been put on a better footing; and a riding academy, with a learned society, have been lately established there.</P>
<P>Moravia being divided into circles, we shall give some account of the chief places in each of them.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The principal places in that of OLMUTZ are,</HEAD>
<P>Holomauc, or Olmutz, the capital of the mar∣quisate, a small, but neat, well-built, populous city, on the river Morawa, eighty miles north of Vienna. It is divided into the Old and New Town, in which are some spacious, regular streets, with fine houses, all painted on the outside, two great squares, a cathedral dedicated to St. Wenzel, (where it is said St. Cyril is interred) several hospi∣tals and cloisters of monks and nuns, a college and seminary of Jesuits, an university, riding academy, learned society, and twenty-six churches. It is a royal borough, and the see of a bishop; and, by means of its river, carries on a considerable trade
<PB N="297" REF="3010"/>
with Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Silesia, and Austria. In the neighbourhood is a cloister of canons regular, of the order of Praemonstratenses, whose abbot is mitred.</P>
<P>Uniczow, Littau, Zwittawy, Muglitz, and Pro∣stniz, walled towns. The first is a royal town, and has a manufacture of salt-petre, glass, and gun-powder.</P>
<P>Hohenstadt, Schumberg, Tobitchau, walled towns, with citadels. Ferdinand II. made a pre∣sent of the second to the prince of Lichtenstein; but it pays its lord only a certain sum of money yearly. In its neighbourhood is a medicinal spring.</P>
<P>Sternberg and Gewiczko, walled towns, with cloisters; in the first, of canons regular of St. Augustine, and, in the second, of hermits, be∣longing to the same order.</P>

<P>Hochwald, Hustopicz, and Kilcz, market-towns, with citadels.</P>
<P>On the frontiers of this circle, towards Hungary and Silesia, stands the mountain Radhost, on which the antient pagan Moravians paid adoration to the idol Radgost.</P>
<P>The district of Kotcher, lying also in this circle, was ceded to the king of Prussia in 1742, and by him incorporated with Upper Silesia.</P>

<HEAD>In the Circle of BRUNN, which is divided into the Upper and Under, and contains about twenty iron mines and works, besides glass-houses, mi∣neral springs, quarries of marble, alum, bastard diamonds, and amethysts, subterraneous cavities, and great numbers of rare plants, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Brunn, or Brinn, the second royal borough of the marquisate, situated twenty-eight miles south-west of Olmutz, fifty north of Vienna, and one hundred and thirteen south-east of Prague. It is well-built, fortified, and inhabited, and the place of the greatest trade in Moravia. Here the courts of judicature and the diets are held. There are six cloisters, a collegiate church, the bishops pa∣lace, and a college of Jesuits in the town, with an hospital of the knights of Malta in the su∣burbs. The cloister of Augustine hermits is famous for an image of the virgin Mary, made, as they pretend, by St. Luke, and a foundation for young ladies. The citadel is called Spielberg, or Spilmberg, and stands on a mountain close to the town.</P>
<P>Wiskow, or Wischau, a walled town, which, about a dozen years ago, was almost entirely burnt down. Without the town is a Capuchin cloister.</P>
<P>Slakow, Austiz, and Kostel, walled towns.</P>
<P>Dubnian, a small town, famous for an appari∣tion of the Virgin.</P>

Raygeern, Tisznow, Wranow, small towns, of which the first has a cloister of Benedictines; the second of Cistercian nuns; and the third of Minims belonging to the order of St. Francis of Paulo, where adoration is paid to a celebrated image of the Virgin.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Circle of ZNOYMO besides mines of iron, me∣dicinal springs, and some vineyards, contains the following places worth mentioning.</HEAD>
<P>Znoymo, Znain, or Znogmo, a royal borough, on the river Teya, and in the road from Prague to Vienna, which makes it a great thoroughfare. Here is a strong castle; but the town being over∣looked by a mountain within cannon shot, is inca∣ble of holding out long. There are four cloisters, with a college of Jesuits in it; and in the neigh∣bourhood two cloisters, and a great many vineyards. Here in 1145 died the emperor Sigismund.</P>
<P>Budweis, a strong walled town.</P>
<P>Krumlaw, a walled town, with a cloister of hermits, of the order of St. Paul.</P>
<P>Gemnice, or Jamniz, Evancice, and Great Bitesch, walled towns. Evancice was once noted for the number of its sects, viz. Hussites, Luther∣ans, Calvinists, Jews, the Holy Brethren of Swis∣serland, who denied baptism, thought it damnable to wear a sword, and received the communion only at Whitsuntide, Photinians, who denied the resur∣rection, and were thought atheists, Quakers, and Anabaptists.</P>

This was the first town of Moravia that received the Augsburgh confession. The principal buildings in it are the Jesuits col∣lege and gymnasium, with two monasteries, one of Dominicans, and another of Franciscans. The trade of the town is chiefly in beer, and a coarse woollen cloth. Besides being situated on the borders of Bohemia, and the high road to Hungary, it is much frequented by travellers.</P>

<HEAD>The Marquisates of UPPER and LOWER LUSATIA.</HEAD>
<P>LUSATIA is bounded to the east by Silesia, to the west by Misnia, to the south by Bohe∣mia, and to the north by the marquisate of Bran∣denburg. Till towards the middle of the fifteenth century, the Upper Lusatia was called the Mark, i. e. the marquisate or the land of Budiszin and Gorlitz; and the Lower only Lusatia, which, it is said, in the Sclavonic, signifies a woody, or marshy country. The air of the Upper Lusatia, which is hilly and mountainous, is better than that of the Lower, a great part of which is moorish and boggy. Both abound in wood, especially the Lower, and turf for fuel. The heathy and moun∣tainous tracts are generally barren; but the lower champaign and marsh lands, are tolerably fertile, producing pasture, wheat, rye, oats, barley, buck wheat, peas, lentils, beans, and millet; together with flax, hops, tobacco, some white and red wine, and what is called manna. Of several of these ar∣ticles, however, considerable quantities are im∣ported. In this country are found also quarries of stone, medicinal springs, bastard diamonds, agates, and jaspers, earths, and clays for tobacco pipes, and all sorts of earthen ware, alum, good iron, stone, vitriolic and copper water; nor is it destitute of cattle, fish, and venison. The rivers Spree, the Schwarze, or Black Elster, and the Pulznitz, have their sources in the Lusatias, which are also watered by the Neisse and Queis. The antient in∣habitants of this country were the Saxons, who were succeeded by the Vandals, and these by the Sorber-Wends, a Sclavonian people. The present
<PB N="303" REF="3070"/>
inhabitants, the descendants of the Wends, have an odd dress, and the language is so inarticulate and guttural, that it hath been said, it might be pro∣nounced without lips, teeth, or tongue; but the towns are almost wholly peopled by Germans.</P>
<P>In the Upper-Lusatia are six towns which appear at the land diets, sixteen smaller country towns, and four market-towns. In the Lower are four diet-towns, thirteen country-towns, and two market ones. Both marquisates were formerly subject ei∣ther to the kings of Bohemia, the archdukes of Au∣stria, or electors of Brandenburg; but, in 1636, both were absolutely ceded to the elector of Saxo∣ny, in lieu of the seventy-two tons of gold, which he expended in assisting the emperor Ferdinand II. against the Bohemians.</P>
<P>Christianity was first planted in Lusatia in the se∣venth century, but it was several centuries after that before popery was fully established. In the eleventh century many cloisters were erected in the country; but at the reformation such numbers embraced Lu∣theranism, that it became the predominant reli∣gion, and still continues, though there are still se∣veral Roman catholic foundations, churches, mar∣ket-towns, and villages. The enthusiastic sect of Herrenhuther's unhappily possesses a great influence and esteem here. There are considerable manu∣factures of woollen and linen stuffs in the Lusatias, especially the Upper. At Budissen, and in the adja∣cent country, prodigious quantities of stockings, spatterdashes, caps, and gloves are made. The linen manufactures also flourish here, chiefly in the Upper-Lusatia, where all sorts of linen are made, printed, and dyed. Exclusive of these, there are considerable manufactures of hats, leather, paper, gunpowder, iron, glass, bleached wax, &amp;c. Tho' the demand and exportation of these commodities, particularly linens and woollens, is not so great as
<PB N="304" REF="3080"/>
formerly, yet it is still considerable, and more than overbalances their importations in wool, yarn, silk, wines, spices, corn, fresh and baked fruits, garden stuff, and hops. Disputes of many years standing have subsisted between the country artificers and li∣nen-manufacturers on the one side, and the diet-towns on the other; the latter unjustly seeking to exclude the former from any share in the linen trade. The natives of this country are said to have quick natural parts, but to be sordidly penurious. We are told they observe the Saxon laws much better than they did the Bohemian. Learning hath been much esteemed and encouraged in both marquisates since the reformation. The schools in the six diet-towns of Upper-Lusatia, particularly at Gorlitz, Budissen, and Zittau, greatly distinguish them∣selves, having handsome stipends. In Lower Lu∣satia also are some good schools, with stipends for the maintenance of students. Printing is said to be much followed, and brought to great perfec∣tion in this country.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>UPPER-LUSATIA.</HEAD>
<P>In Upper-Lusatia the states consist, 1st, of those called state-lords; 2dly, of the prelates; 3dly, of the gentry and commonalty, under which are comprehended the counts, barons, nobles, and bur∣gesses, possessors of fees and fief-estates; and, 4thly, of the representatives of the six principal towns. Without the consent of these states no taxes can be imposed, not any thing of importance, that regards the public, transacted. The diets are ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary meet once in three years, and the extraordinary when summoned by the sovereign upon particular emer∣gencies. As to ecclesiastical matters, the dean of Budissen and his consistory exercise all manner of
<PB N="305" REF="3090"/>
episcopal jurisdiction; and, among the protestants, the jurisdiction belongs either to the superior, the upper-office, or the patrons. The revenues arising to the superior or sovereign, from Upper-Lusatia, consist partly of the subsidies granted by the states, among which, at present, are reckoned capitation and estate-money; and partly of the beer-tax, ex∣cise, tolls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upper-Lusatia is divided into two great circles, viz. those of Budessen and Gorlitz, which are again divided into lesser circles.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the Circle of BUDESSEN the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Budessen or Bautzen, which gives name to it, and is the capital not only of the circle, but of the whole marquisate. It is also the seat of the land-diets, and of the chief offices and tribunals, being pretty large, well built, fortified, and inhabited, and standing on the Spree, twenty miles north-west of Gorlitz, twenty-seven east of Dresden, and six∣ty north of Prague. Its castle is strongly situated upon a high rock, but within the town-walls. In one part of the cathedral the Lutherans perform divine service, and the Roman catholics in the other. There are several other churches here for the two religions, with a fine council-house and library, an orphan-house, a house for spinning, a house of cor∣rection, three hospitals, a gymnasium, and two diet-houses. The revenues of the town, and its trade in linen, hats, stockings, gloves, Turky manu∣factures, glazed leather, cloth, fustian, &amp;c. are very considerable.</P>
<P>Camenz, on the Elster, one of the six towns that have a seat in the diets. Here are eight churches, three hospitals, and a Latin school, with a manu∣facture of linen and woolen cloths.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="3100"/>
Lobau or Liebe, another of the six state-towns, which hold their several meetings in the council house here. It is small, but antient and pretty well built, and has a good trade in linen and yarn. Near it also is a mineral spring.</P>
<P>Pulsnitz, a small town belonging to the family of Maxen, and having a citadel.</P>
<P>Weissenberg, a small free town, but subject to the jurisdiction of the office of Budeszin.</P>
<P>Marklissa, a small town, having a Latin school, and a great trade in linens and fustians.</P>
<P>Baruth, a small town, with a citadel, in a spot so pleasant and fertile, that it is called the Golden Au, or Meadow. It belonged, so early as the thirteenth century, to the very antient family of Gorsdorff, which, besides, is proprietor of thirteen knights∣fees, all in Upper-Lusatia.</P>
<P>Konigswarta and Uhyst, small towns, with castles, the latter on the Spree.</P>
<P>In this circle lie the districts belonging to the dean and chapter of St. Peter in Budissen, and the cloister of Marienstern, with the two state-seignio∣ries of Hoyerswerda and Konigsbruck, the latter of which is the property of the count of Triese, but the revenues of the former, at present, are paid into the electoral chamber.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Circle of GORLITZ.</HEAD>
<P>This circle is subject to the office-captain of Gor∣litz, and subdivided into the circles of Gorlitz, Zittau, and Lauban. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Gorlitz, the capital of the circle, and one of the six state-towns. It is said to be the largest and most populous town in the whole marquisate, standing twenty miles east of Budissen, and hav∣ing, within the walls, three churches, a gymnasium, an orphan-house, the bailiffs seat, the circle-office,
<PB N="307" REF="3110"/>
and a house of correction; and, without the walls, an hospital, and five churches, in one of which is a model of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, which George Emerich, the burgomaster, caused to be e∣rected in the year 1480. The town is fortified in the antient manner, has considerable revenues, with a trade in beer, and in making, dressing, and dying woollen and linen cloth.</P>
<P>Zittau, one of the six state towns, situate on the river Neisse, thirteen miles south-east of Gorlitz. It is well built, fortified in the antient manner, and has a considerable revenue, with a good trade in beer, and manufactures of cloth, linen, and blue paper. Here are several churches and hospitals, within and without the walls, and a council-library, gymnasium, and orphan-house.</P>
<P>Laubau, another of the six state towns, standing on the river Queis, and having a good trade in woolen and linen cloth. Here is a cloister of Ci∣stercian nuns, of the order of Mary Magdalen de penitentia, whose prioress is of the states, and to which several villages belong. The town is pretty well fortified.</P>
<P>Muska, a small town on the Neisse, with a fine citadel. It has an alum-work near it, and gives name to one of the state-seigniories of the circle be∣longing to count Calenberg.</P>
<P>Great Radmeritz or Rathmeritz, a small town, in which is a noble free temporal foundation for twelve ladies. Their house is called Joachimstein, being a stately structure, with a great estate annex∣ed to it.</P>
<P>Herrenhuth, a small place, near the village of Berthelsdorff, belonging to count Zinzendorff. It was first founded, in 1722, by some Moravian bre∣thren, and is now the chief nursery and seat of that sect, denominated from thence Herrenhuthers.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="3120"/>
Sydenberg, a small place, giving name to the other state-seigniory, possessed at present by the count of Einsidel.</P>
<P>Marienthal, a Cistercian cloister, whose abbess is of the states, and which has a large estate.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LOWER-LUSATIA.</HEAD>
<P>The land-states of this marquisate consist, like those of the Upper, of prelates, lords, and knights, and the representatives of the state-towns, which are Luckau, Gubben Lubben, and Kalau. Two land-diets are yearly held at Lubben, called volun∣tary diets; but when the superior causes the states to be summoned together at his discretion, and pro∣positions to be laid before them by commissaries de∣puted for that purpose, such convention is called a great land diet. The marquisate is divided into five circles, each of which holds a circle-assembly in its circle town. The chief officers appointed either by the superior or the states are, the president of the upper-office, the land-captain, and the land-judge. The principal tribunals are, the land-court, and the upper office, to which lie appeals from the infe∣rior judicatories. There are also officers for the several circles. Spiritual matters here belong to a consistory, erected in 1668. The ordinary taxes are paid into the chest of the circle, and from thence consigned to the general chest, of which the upper tax-receiver is superintendant. By him an annual account of the receipts is made out. which is examined and passed by the deputies of the states.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the Circle of LUCKAU the only place worth mentioning is,</HEAD>
<P>Luckau, which gives name to it, and is the ca∣pital of Lower-Lusatia. It is walled, and has a Latin school, with a correction and poor house, two
<PB N="309" REF="3130"/>
hospilals, and several churches. To the council jurisdiction belong twenty-two villages.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The principal places in the Circle of GUBEN are,</HEAD>
<P>Guben, which gives name to it, and is the chief town. It stands on the river Neisse, is pretty large and well fortified, and has several churches, with an hospital and Latin school. Here also some cloth, and a good deal of wine is made. To the council jurisdiction belong six villages.</P>
<P>Neu-zell, where is a Cistercian foundation, the abbot of which is the principal prelate and first land-state in Lower-Lusatia. To this foundation belong thirty-six villages, besides the little town of Furstenberg, upon the Oder, where a toll is paid.</P>
<P>Schiedlo, a village in an island of the Oder, where another toll is paid. These tolls are very disagreeable to the king of Prussia, who would have the navigation of the Oder free.</P>
<P>Schenkendorf, a small place, where is the seat of a commandery belonging to the order of St. John at Sonneburg, and containing several vil∣lages.</P>
<P>Forsta, a small place, having both an old and new citadel, with a manufacture of linen, fine woollen cloth, and tapestry. It also gives name to a seigniory belonging to count Bruhl, and con∣taining, besides this town, thirty-five villages, eighteen of which are possessed by vassals. Here is a peculiar chancery, fief-court, and consistory.</P>
<P>Pforten, the chief place of a seigniory, contain∣ing twenty villages.</P>
<P>Sorau, a small town, which gives name to a seigniory belonging to the counts of Promnitz. Here is a castle, in which the counts reside, several churches, a good school and hospital, with a ma∣nufacture of woolen cloth, linen, and yarn.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="3140"/>
Triebel and Amtitz, small places, having cita∣dels, and giving name to seigniories.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the Circle of LUBEN the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Lubben, on the Spree, which is the seat of the diets, and of the chief tribunals and offices, and has several churches, with a noble land-house and hospital.</P>
<P>Friedland, which gives name to a seigniory, be∣longing to the master of the order of St. John at Sonnenburg, and containing also several villages. In this circle are also the seigniories of Leuthel, Lieberose, Straupitz, and Neuen-Sauche.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The chief places in the Circle of KALAU are,</HEAD>
<P>Kalau, which, though it gives name to the cir∣cle, and is one of the state-towns, is but a mean inconsiderable place.</P>
<P>Dobrilugk, a small town, which gives name to a seigniory belonging to the elector. Henry, the last duke of Merseburgh, died here in the year 1738.</P>
<P>Lubbenau, a small town on the Spree, with a castle. It gives name to a seigniory belonging to the counts of Lynar, and containing, besides this town, about twenty villages.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the Circle of SPREMBERGH the only place worth mentioning is,</HEAD>
<P>Sprembergh, which gives name to it. Though the chief town of the circle, it is not represented in the diets; but has a citadel, and gives name to a seigniory, belonging to the elector, and containing, besides itself, thirty-two villages.</P>
<P>There is a part of Lower-Lusatia, exclusive of these circles, that belongs to the king of Prussia.</P>

<HEAD>SILESIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS duchy is bounded to the east by Po∣land; to the west by Moravia, Bohemia, Lu∣satia, and the county of Glatz; to the north by a chain of mountains, and a thicket of considerable extent, which separates it from Hungary; and to the north by the mark of Brandenburg. From north-west to south-east it is about two hundred and twenty-five miles, and about an hundred where broadest; but it is much contracted at both ends. Upon the frontiers of this country, to the west and south, are very high mountains, and some likewise in other parts of it. One of the ridges upon the frontiers is stiled the Riphaean Mountains, ano∣ther the Moravian, another the Bohemian, and another the Hungarian, Crapack, or Carpathian. A branch of the Bohemian is called the Giant Mountains. The winter on these hilly tracts is more severe, sets in sooner, and lasts longer, than in the low lands. The inhabitants use a kind of skaits when the snow is deep, as they do in Carniola. Little or no grain is raised in the mountains, and some sandy tracts; but the rest of the country is abundantly fruitful, not only in grain, but fruits, roots, pasture, flax, hops, madder, tobacco, and hemp, yielding also some wine, with considerable quantities of silk and honey. In many places are great woods of pines, fir, beech, larch, and other trees, affording tar, pitch, rosin, turpentine, lamp-black, and timber for all uses. In this country also is found marble of several sorts, some precious stones, limestone, millstone, pit-coal, turf, vitriol, some silver ore, cop∣per,
<PB N="312" REF="3160"/>
lead, iron, and mineral springs. Great num∣bers of black cattle and horses are brought hither from Poland and Hungary for sale, those bred in the country not being sufficient; but of sheep, goats, game, and venison, they have great plenty. As for wild-beasts, here are lynxes, foxes, weasels, otters, and beavers. The rivers, lakes, and ponds, yield fish of several sorts, particularly sturgeons several ells in length, and sal∣mon. Besides a number of smaller streams to water this country, there is the Oder, which traverses it almost from one end to the other, and the Vistula, which, after a pretty long course through it, enters Poland. The number of the cities and market-towns is said to be about two hundred, the county of Glatz included, and that of the villages five thousand. The inhabitants, who are computed to be about a million and an half, are a mixture of Ger∣mans, Poles, and Moravians. The language ge∣nerally spoken is German, but in some places the vulgar tongue is a dialect of the Sclavonic. The states consist of the princes and dukes, and those called state-lords, with the nobility, who are im∣mediately subject to the sovereign, and the repre∣sentatives of the chief cities; but since the coun∣try fell under the dominion of the king of Prussia, no furstentage or diets have been held. The king however, when he took possession of the country, confirmed all the other privileges of the inhabi∣tants. With respect to religion, not only protestants, but papists, Jews, and Greeks, enjoy full liberty of conscience. The greatest part of Silesia lies in the diocese of Breslau, but some part of it in the Polish dioceses of Posen and Cracow. The bishop of Breslau stands immediately under the pope with regard to spirituals, but all ecclesiastical benefices, not excepting the see of Breslau, is in the king's gift. Besides Latin schools, colleges, and semina∣ries,
<PB N="213" REF="3170"/>
at Breslau is an university, and at Lignitz an academy for martial exercises. The principal ma∣nufactures here are woollens, linens, and cottons of several sorts, with hats, glass-ware, gunpowder, and iron manufactures. Of these, and the manufac∣tures of the country mentioned above, there is a considerable exportation. Accounts are generally kept in rix-dollars, silver groschens, and deuaren. With respect to its revolutions and present govern∣ment, it was long a part of the kingdom of Poland; afterwards it had several dukes and petty princes for its sovereigns, who by degrees became subject to the kings of Bohemia, until, at last, king Charles IV. incorporated the whole duchy with Bohemia; and thus it continued in the possession of the house of Austria, until the present king of Prussia, taking advantage of the troubles that ensued upon the death of the emperor Charles VI. and pretending a kind of claim, wrested a great part of it, together with the county of Glatz, from his daughter and heiress, Maria Theresa, the present empress dowa∣ger; so that now only a small part of it is possessed by the house of Austria, and connected with the empire, the rest being governed by the king of Prussia, without acknowledging any sort of de∣pendence on the crown of Bohemia or the empire. For the administration of justice in all civil, cri∣minal, and feudal cases, and such as relate to the revenue, the king of Prussia has established three supreme judicatories, to which an appeal lies from all the inferior ones, and from which, when the sum exceeds five hundred rix-dollars, causes may be moved to Berlin. The Lutheran churches and schools are under the inspection of the upper-con∣sistories, and those of the papists under that of the bishop's court at Breslau; but from both an ap∣peal lies to the tribunal at Berlin. As to the re∣venue, the excise here is levied only in the walled towns, being on the same footing as in the mark
<PB N="314" REF="3180"/>
of Brandenburg; but in the rest of the country the contributions are fixed, and the same both in peace and war. The several branches of the revenue are under the management of the war and domain offices of Breslau and Glogau. The whole revenue arising to the king of Prussia from Silesia, and the county of Glatz, amounts to about four millions of rix-dollars per annum.</P>
<P>Silesia is divided into the Upper and Lower, and each of these again into principalities and lordships; of some of which, both the property and jurisdic∣tion belong immediately to the sovereign, but of others to his subjects and vassals. In regard to the character of the people, the boors are accounted very dull and silly; but of those of a higher rank, many have distinguished themselves by their wit and learning, as well as by their military and poli∣tical talents. However, in general, like their neighbours the Germans and Bohemians, they have more of Mars than Mercury in their composition, and their parts are more solid than shining. In our more particular description of the duchy, we shall give a short account of the several principa∣lities and districts into which it is divided, begin∣ning with those of</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LOWER-SILESIA.</HEAD>
<P>The principalities of Lower Silesia are those of Breslau, Brieg, Schweidnitz, Jauer, Lignitz, Wo∣lau, Glogau, Neusze, Oels, Sagan, Munstersberg, Traehenberg, and Carolath; and the lordships of Wartenberg-Militsch, and Goschietz.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Principality of BRESLAU.</HEAD>
<P>This principality being every where level and flat, is an excellent corn country, yielding also
<PB N="315" REF="3190"/>
good-pasture, and abounding with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, but is destitute of wood, ex∣cept in one district or circle; and the roads, in ge∣neral, are very bad. It is an immediate principa∣lity, that is, one of which both the property and jurisdiction belong to the king, forming a part of one of the three bailiwics into which all the im∣mediate principalities are divided. The chief town not only of it, but of the whole duchy, is</P>
<P>Breslau, situated at the conflux of the Oder and Ohlau, one hundred and twenty miles north-east of Prague, and north-west of Cracow; about one hundred fifty-four north-east of Berlin; and one hundred and forty-seven north of Vienna. In∣cluding the suburbs, it is of great extent, having many large, regular squares, broad streets, stately public and private edifices; but the fortifications are of no great importance. Here are in particu∣lar a great many churches and convents belonging to the Catholics, of the former are also several belonging to the Lutherans, one to the Calvi∣nists, and one to the Greeks. The Jews have likewise two synagogues here, and the Jesuits a college; the bishop a stately palace, and the Lutherans two gymnasiums. The popish uni∣versity is a noble structure, nor is the exchange destitute of magnificence. This city is the seat of all the high colleges, and the third in rank, next to Berlin and Konigsberg, in all the Prussian domi∣nions. The magistracy of it is Lutheran, and its trade and manufactures very considerable. Seve∣ral of the monasteries and nunneries are very mag∣nificent; and there are also some good public libra∣ries in it, with two armories, a college of physicians, and a mint. Breslau is very populous, and much frequented by Hungarian, Bohemian, Polish, and other foreign merchants, having several yearly fairs.</P>
<P>There are ten other towns in this principality; and the villages are so numerous, that they stand
<PB N="316" REF="3200"/>
within cannon shot of one another. Of the towns, the principal are Neumarkt, Cauth, and Nam∣slau, each of which give name to a circle, as well as Breslau. At the village of Leuthen, in the circle of Neumarkt, the Prussians, in 1757, ob∣tained a signal victory over the Austrians.</P>

<HEAD>The Principality of BRIEG.</HEAD>
<P>This is one of the largest and most fruitful in all Silesia, and is watered by the Oder and Ohlau.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of GLATZ.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by Bohemia, Silesia, and Moravia, from all which it is separated by moun∣tains, so that it is of very difficult access. Its length is upwards of thirty miles, and its breadth of twen∣ty, being beautifully diversified with hills, dales, meadows, fields, streams, towns, villages, and yielding wheat, pasture, wood, game, and fish, especially trout; quarries of stone, pit-coal, mar∣ble, jasper, topazes, cornelians, mineral springs, and warm baths. It is also well watered by the Neysz, and a number of lesser streams. Since it fell under the dominion of Prussia, the landtage, or diets, have been discontinued. The language usually spoken is the German, and the principal manufactures are thread and linen; but the inha∣bitants live chiefly by tillage and grazing. Till the king of Prussia got possession of the county, popery alone was tolerated in it; but now the Lu∣therans have the free exercise of their religion. From 1561, to 1742, this county continued an∣nexed to the crown of Bohemia, when it was ceded to the king of Prussia, his heirs and descendants, for ever, by the peace of Berlin. For the govern∣ment of it, there is a regency at Glatz. From the tribunals, whether civil or ecclesiastical, an appeal lies to the courts at Breslau, and from them to the tribunal at Berlin. The several offices here also are subordinate to the war and domain chambers at Breslaw. Places of most note in the county are,</P>
<P>Glatz, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal, standing by the Neysze, on the declivity of a hill. It is strongly fortified, and contains an old castle, or citadel, of great extent, which hath been much improved, and strengthened by the

<PB N="333" REF="3370"/>
a governor over it. The inhabitants are a mixture of French, Germans, and Swissers, and most of them protestants; but the churches belong to the Roman catholics. The county extends twenty-two miles east and west, and as many south and north, yielding corn, wine, wood, cattle, wild fowl, and venison in abundance; but the sove∣reign's revenue arises chiefly from the iron-mines. The only place in it worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, and is its captital, viz.</P>
<P>Mumpelgard, called by the French Montbei∣lard, standing near the conflux of the Alaine and Le Doux, and containing a palace, in which the governor resides, several churches, and a gymna∣sium.</P>
<P>The lordship of Asch is surrounded by the prin∣cipality of Culmbach, the Vogtland, and the king∣dom of Bohemia. It belongs to baron Zedwitz, and, besides the market-town of Asch, contains about twenty villages.</P>
<P>There are a great many lordships, market towns, and villages in the empire; that belong to the free nobility thereof, who are mostly counts and barons, and form a society under certain regulations, and endowed with divers privileges, though they have no seat in the diets of the empire and circles. They are divided into the circles of Swabia, Franconia, and the Rhine, and generally hold their estates im∣mediately of the emperor and empire. In the time of a general war, or other pressing exigency, instead of personal service, to which they are bound, they contribute a sum of money to the emperor, but pay nothing to the chamber at Wetzlar. There is no place belonging to the nobility of the circles of Franconia and the Rhine worth mentioning, and the only place belonging to a member of the no∣biliar circle of Swabia, that deserves our notice, is

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HUNGARY, And its incorporated COUNTRIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its NAME, SITUATION, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom, or at least the greatest part of it, was antiently called Pannonia, from the Pannonians, who were descended of the Sclavi; but it took the name of Hungary from the Huns, a Scythian, or Tartar nation, who took possession of it in the ninth century. It lies between the 18th and 22d degrees of east long. and betwixt the 45th and 49th degrees of north lat. being bound∣ed to the north by the Carpathian mountains, which separate it from Poland; to the south by Servia, and the river Drave, which separates it from Scla∣vonia; to the west by Moravia, Austria, and Sti∣ria; and to the east by Walachia and Transylvania. It is about two hundred and forty miles in length,
<PB N="336" REF="3400"/>
and two hundred and thirty-five in breadth, and it divided into the Upper and Lower Hungary, the former being that part which lies towards the east, and the latter that which lies towards the west.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The northern parts of the kingdom are moun∣tainous and barren, but healthy; the southern, on the contrary, are level, and exceeding fruitful, but not very healthy. The country along the Danube, from Presburg to Belgrade, for upwards of two hundred miles, is one continued plain, and no soil can be more fertile; but the air, by reason of the many swamps and morasses, is not so wholesome, as on the higher and drier grounds. Here are mines of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, quick∣silver, cinnabar, antimony, yellow orpiment, sul∣phur, vitriol, marcasite, salt native, and factitious, saltpetre, magnets, asbestos, or stone-flax, marble of several colours, alabaster, with diamonds, and all sorts of precious stones. Corn is in such plenty, that it is sold for one-sixth of its price in England. Their grapes are large and luscious; and their wines, especially those of Tockay, preferred to any in Europe. They have vast numbers of cattle and horses, the latter mostly mouse coloured, with buffaloes, deer, wild fowl, game, and fish, and many species of wild beasts, particularly chamois goats, bears, and lynxes. Of vegetables, besides vines, and the common sorts, here are tobacco, saffron, buck-wheat, millet, melons, and chesnuts. Here also are excellent warm baths, and springs of various kinds and qualities. The chief mountains of Hungary are the Crapack, or Crapathian, which is the general name for all those that separate this kingdom from Poland, Moravia, Silesia, and some part of Austria. The sides of most of them
<PB N="337" REF="3410"/>
are covered with wood, and their tops with snow. The chief rivers are the Danube, the Drave, the Save, the Wag or Waag, the Gran, the Temes, the Raab, and Theiss, all well stocked with fish; especially the last, the carps of which have been sold for a crown the thousand. There are several lakes among the Carpathian mountains, and some also in the lowlands.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORIGIN, CHARACTER, and MANNERS of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The inhabitants are a mixture of the descendants of the antient Huns, Sclavonians, Camani, Ger∣mans, Walachians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, and a wandering people, called Zigduns, said to be of uncertain origin, but, probably, the same as those we call gypsies. The Hungarians are said to be of a sanguine choleric temper, and somewhat fierce, cruel, proud, and revengeful. They have been always reputed good soldiers, being much more inclined to arms, martial exercises, and hunting, than to arts, learning, trade, or agriculture. The nobility affect great pomp and magnificence, and are much addicted to feasting and carousing. The men, in general, are strong and well proportioned. They shave their beards, but leave whiskers on the upper-lip; wearing fur caps on their heads, a close-bodied coat, girt with a sash, with a short cloak, or mantle over all, so contrived, as to be buckled under the arm, and leave the right hand at liberty. Their horse are called hussars, and their foot heydukes. The former wear a broad∣sword, or scymeter, and carry a hatchet or battle∣ax. Their horses are fleet, but not near so large as the German horses, and therefore they stand up on their short stirrups, when they strike. The heydukes usually wear feathers in their caps, ac∣cording
<PB N="338" REF="3420"/>
to the number of the enemies they pretend to have killed. Both horse and foot are an excel∣lent militia, very good at a pursuit, or ravaging and plundering a country, but not equal to regu∣lar troops in a pitched battle. The women, when they go abroad, wear short cloaks, and a veil.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, and SEMINARIES.</HEAD>
<P>There are four languages spoken in this country, viz the Hungarian, which, like the people, is of Scythian origin, and has little or no affinity with any European tongue; the German, Sclavonian, Wallachian, and Latin. The last is spoken not only by the better sort, but also by the common people, though very corruptly. The people call∣ed Zigduns have also a particular jargon. Christi∣anity was planted in Hungary in the ninth and tenth centuries. In the sixteenth the reformation made a great progress in it; but at present, tho' the Roman catholics hardly make a fourth part of the inhabitants, their religion is predominant, the protestants enjoying only a bare toleration. Be∣sides several sects of protestants, here are also great numbers of the Greek church and Jews; the last pay double taxes of all kinds. Besides Jesuits colleges and other convents, there are several uni∣versities for the Roman catholics. The Lutherans also and Calvinists have their gymnasiums and schools, but under divers restrictions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>As to the traffic of this country, it is almost wholly in the hands of the Greeks and Jews. The exports consist chiefly of wine, horses, cattle, metals, minerals, saffron, wool, and leather. Hungary, in particular, furnishes Austria, and
<PB N="339" REF="3430"/>
other countries west of it, with vast droves of cattle, as well as variety of excellent wines, of which those of Tockay are reckoned the best. The prin∣cipal manufactures are those of copper, brass, iron, and other hard wares. Great quantities of brass and iron are exported, wrought and unwrought.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Hungary at first, like most other countries, was divided into many little principalities and states, which at length were united under one head, who had the title of duke. The last of these dukes was Geysa, who becoming a proselyte to Christianity, was baptized; after which he resigned the government to his son Stephen, who took the title of king, anno 1000: but as the throne was filled by election, though generally out of the same family, the disposal of the crown was dis∣puted between the Turkish and German em∣perors for near two hundred years; but after the year 1527, when Ferdinand, archduke of Austria, was advanced to the throne, the Austrians found means to influence the elections in such a manner, as to keep the crown in their family till 1687, when it was settled hereditarily on their heirs male; and now, in consequence of an act made by the diet at Presburg, in 1723, in case of the failure of heirs male, it is to descend to females. The states of the kingdom consist of the prelates, the barons, the gentry, and the royal towns. To the first class be∣long two archbishops, about a dozen bishops, near as many abbots and provosts, with the Pauline &amp; Praemonstratensian Jesuits. To the second, the stadtholder or palatine, who represents the king, the court-judge, the ban or viceroy of Dalmatia, Croatia, and Sclavonia, the stadtholder of Tran∣silvania, the great treasurer, the great cup-bearer,
<PB N="340" REF="3440"/>
the steward of the houshold, the master of the horse, the lord-chamberlain, the captain of the yeomen of the guards, and the grand-marshal of the courts, who are stiled the great barons, together with the inferior bans, or counts and barons. To the third class belong the gentry, some of whom have noble manors, and others only the privileges of nobles. To the fourth class belong the royal free cities, which are not subject to the counts, but hold immediately of the king. The gentry also, who hold of the archbishops and bishops, have the same privileges as the Hungarian nobility. The common people are vassals to the lords, on whose lands they live, whether these lands belong to the crown, the clergy, nobility, or gentry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The ordinary revenue of this kingdom is said to exceed a million sterling, arising from the mines, duties on cattle, royal demesnes, salt-works, con∣tributions, customs, &amp;c. The fortifications and garrisons canstantly maintained on the frontiers a∣gainst the Turks, are a great expence to the go∣vernment. Hungary can easily bring into the field one hundred thousand men, regulars and militia; for there are fifty thousand in actual pay, and the provinces furnish the other fifty thousand, when they are wanted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIVISION and CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Hungary, as we observed above, is divided into Upper and Lower, which are subdivided each into two circles, and these again into counties, called by the natives Varmegye.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="341" REF="3450"/>
<HEAD>The principal places in LOWER-HUNGARY are,</HEAD>
<P>Presburg, the capital of the kingdom, called by the inhabitants Posony and Presporen, situ∣ated on the Danube, about forty-six miles east from Vienna, and seventy-five from Buda. The castle, in which the regalia are kept, stands on a hill above the town. Here the states assemble; and in the cathedral, dedicated to St. Martin, the king is crowned. The town is not very large, nor well built, but is very antient, and pleasantly situated, and enjoys a good air. Its fortifications are only a double wall and ditch. In the lower suburbs is is a hill, where the king, after his coronation, goes on horseback, and brandishes St. Stephen's sword towards the four cardinal points, intimating, that he will defend his country against all its enemies. Besides the cathedral, there are several other popish and one Lutheran church, with a Jesuits college, three convents, and two hospitals. It gives name to a county, and is the residence of the archbishop of Gran, who is primate, chief secretary, and chan∣cellor of the kingdom, legatus natus of the papal see, and prince of the Holy Roman empire.</P>
<P>Tirnau, a handsome royal town on the river Ti∣na. Hither the archiepiscopal chapter of Gran was removed, when that city fell into the hands of the Turks, in 1543. There are a great many churches and convents in this town, besides an aca∣demy of Jesuits.</P>
<P>Modra, a royal free-city, at the foot of the Car∣pathian mountains, with vineyards on one side.</P>
<P>Bozin, a small but handsome royal-city on a rising ground. Near it is a castle belonging to count Palfy.</P>
<P>St. George, a small town, at the foot of a mountain, noted for the fine flavour of its wine.
<PB N="342" REF="3460"/>
These four towns are all in the county or pro∣vince of Presburg, which lies on the north-side of the Danube, and is upwards of forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. Count Palfy is hereditary∣palatine of it. The crops in this county are often greatly damaged by mildew.</P>
<P>Nitra, a well peopled, but meanly built town, on a river of the same name. It is the see of a bishop, whose palace and cathedral are in the castle that stands above the town. The water here is said to be unwholsome. The town gives name to a pro∣vince or county about forty-eight miles in length, and from eight to twenty-four in breadth, of which the bishop is palatine, and in which is some good corn land, with mineral springs, warm baths, and vineyards.</P>
<P>Leopoldstadt, a strong regular fortification on the Wag, and the only place in the county of Ni∣tra capable of making head against an enemy.</P>
<P>Trentschin, a royal free city on the Wag, and the capital of the county to which it gives name, and which extends along the Wag to the frontiers of Moravia and Silesia. Here is a castle, standing on a steep rock.</P>
<P>Welicona, the capital of the county of Arva, which lies between Silesia and the Carpathian mountains, and extends as far as Poland.</P>
<P>Lepto-Ujvar-Hradek, a castle which gives name to a county every where full of mountains and rocks, higher than those of the Alps; one in parti∣cular, called Benikova, is three thousand paces per∣pendicular height. They abound in metals, mine∣rals, and medicinal springs, with caverns, in which are many curious figures in drop-stone. The exhalations from some of the mineral springs suffocate birds in their flight over them. The chief towns in this county are Botza and Rosenberg.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="3470"/>
Szent, a pretty large populous town, and the capital of the county of Thurotze, which is level and fertile, and contains some mineral springs and baths.</P>
<P>Neusohl, the capital of the county of Altsohl, which is mountainous, and abounds in cattle and sheep, ores, minerals, medicinal springs, and warm baths. At the village of Herrengrund are vast copper-works; for out of the earth here oozes a vitriol by which iron is changed into copper. The effluvia of some of the warm springs in the county kill both beasts and birds; yet the water may be drank, and the birds and beasts killed by the efflu∣via safely eaten.</P>
<P>Cremnitz, one of the chief of the mine-towns, and the capital of the county of Bars. It lies in a deep valley, betwixt high mountains, in which are many gold and other mines; but so exhausted are those of gold, that the ore got from them scarcely answers the expence of working them. There is a mint in the town for the coinage of gold ducats, &amp;c. to which all the other mine-towns bring their gold and silver. Both the air and water here are very unwholsome. Above the town is a castle, with a church. There are many other towns in the county, of which those of Skleno and Eisenbach are famous for their hot baths.</P>
<P>Schemnitz, a pretty large town, and the capital of the county of Hont. Two-thirds of the in∣habitants are protestants. This is the principal mine-town in Hungary; the gold and silver mines here still producing a considerable quantity of ore, though far short of what they did formerly: a∣bout a thousand workmen are still employed in the mines and mine-works. Mr. Keysler says, the expence of working all the mines in Hungary is above a million of guilders. Here are two castles. In the county are several warm baths and medi∣cinal springs, with load-stone, iron, and lead ore;
<PB N="344" REF="3480"/>
but the air about the mines and mine-towns is ac∣counted very unwholesome.</P>
<P>Neograd, a large village, giving name to a coun∣ty which is mountainous and woody, but in some parts yields excellent wine, together with medicinal springs, of which some are warm in winter, and cold in summer.</P>
<P>Pesth, a royal free town, in a plain, on the Da∣nube, over-against Buda, where the supreme court of appeals is held. Here also is a large military hospital, with several churches and convents, and a bridge of boats of great length over the Da∣nube. The town is surrounded by a wall and moat, and gives name to a county, which is united to those of Pilis and Solth, yields an excellent red and white wine, but is mostly mountainous, woody, and barren, and has little good water. Near it is a field in which many diets have been held, and kings chosen.</P>
<P>Vaitz, a considerable city on the Danube, being the see of a bishop, and having a great annual fair, and beast-market, with several convents.</P>
<P>Buda, called Ofen-Buda by the inhabitants. There are two towns of this name, the Old and New Old Buda is but a poor mean place, but the New is a royal free town, standing on the Danube, seventy-five miles from Presburg, and an hundred and six from Vienna. It is well fortified, and was the capital of the kingdom and residence of the king, until it was seized by the Turks in 1529, in whose hands it continued till 1689. Here is a castle situated at the extremity of the town, on the east side, commanding the greatest part of it. Here also are several warm baths, of which some are so moderate, that they are immediately fit either for bathing or drinking; but others are so hot, that they cannot be used until mixed with cold water, or conveyed to cool in other baths. The town has
<PB N="345" REF="3490"/>
considerable suburbs. The neighbouring country yields a good red wine, and excellent melons. Hard by the town is the island of St. Andrew, in the Da∣nube, eight miles long, and eight broad: and near it, on the banks of the river, is the town of St. Andrew, which makes a better figure than Buda itself. A few miles also below Buda is another island, called Esepel, which formerly belonged to prince Eugene, who had a seat in the neighbour∣hood, where he often resided. From the same prince a pleasant mountain, that runs into the Da∣nube and is covered with woods and vineyards, is called Eugene Promontory. The Danube here is a∣bout a quarter of a league in breadth.</P>
<P>Coloesa, the see of an archbishop, standing for∣ty eight miles south-east from Buda. The town was destroyed by the Hungarian rebels in 1602, and afterwards by the Turks; but now begins to thrive again.</P>
<P>Szent-Miklos, the capital of the province of Lit∣tle-Cumany, taking its name from the Cumani, who formerly dwelt betwixt the Nieper and the Black Sea; but being expelled by the Tartars, in 1237, went and settled in Hungary. Among other places in the county is Pandour, a village, from which those well-known irregulars called Pandours take their name.</P>
<P>Batz, formerly an episcopal city, but now, with its bishopric, united to Coloesa. It gives name to a county in which, near the village of Zeuth on the Theis, prince Eugene, anno 1697, defeated the Turks, with great slaughter. The above places are in the circle, as it is called, beyond the Danube.</P>
<P>In the other, called the circle below the Danube, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Oedenburg or Edenburg, the capital of the coun∣ty to which it gives name. It lies thirty-four miles
<PB N="346" REF="3500"/>
south-west from Presburg, is well built and popu∣lous, and has large suburbs. The neighbourhood is noted for good wine. Several diets have been held here; one in particular, anno 1601, in which the emperor Leopold granted the protestants the free exercise of their religion.</P>
<P>Wieselburg, a large town, giving name to a county, in which is also Altenburg or O-Var, a beautiful town on a branch of the Danube, with Gabo, Kopsin, and Neusiedel, considerable towns. The last gives name to a lake twenty miles long, and nine broad.</P>
<P>Raab, a town strongly fortified, at the conflux of the Danube, Raab, and Rabnitz. It is the see of a bishop, and has an university, with a strong garri∣son. In the county to which it gives name, is the chief Benedictine abbey in Hungary, situate on a hill, called Martin's-berg, from the saint to which the convent is dedicated.</P>
<P>Comorra, a royal free town, at the conflux of the Danube and Wag, near which is a very strong for∣tress, and a large island in the Danube, called Schul. It gives name to a county, in which are quarries of white and red marble, and some other considerable towns, besides the remains of the old town of Bre∣getium, where many curious antiquities have been found.</P>
<P>Gran, a royal free town on the Danube, where it is joined by the river Gran, thirty-five miles from Presburg, and ninety-two from Vienna. Here are some natural warm baths. When this city was be∣sieged by the Imperialists, in 1596, Sir Thomas Arundel, of Wardour castle, distinguished himself in such a manner, that the emperor Rodolph created him a count of the empire, and king James I. made him a baron of England, which honours are still enjoyed by his posterity. The neighbouring country is very pleasant and fruitful, and yields
<PB N="347" REF="3510"/>
excellent wine. The town is well fortified, gives name to a county, and has a castle, on a high rock, in which is the cathedral; but the archbishop, who is primate of Hungary, resides at Presburg, and the chapter at Tirnau.</P>
<P>Alba-Regalis, a royal free town, situate in a marsh, on the river Sarwitz. Here the kings of Hungary were formerly crowned and interred; but though it is still a considerable place, including its suburbs, it is much fallen from what it was for∣merly.</P>
<P>Tolna, a pretty large town on the Danube, giving name to a county, in which are several other towns. The red wine of Sexard is much esteemed.</P>
<P>Pets, otherwise called Five-Churches, an episco∣pal see, pleasantly situated, and the capital of the county of Baran, which yields a good wine, and contains some other towns, particularly Siklos, where the emperor Sigismund was imprisoned.</P>
<P>Szigeth, a strong town in the county of Samegy-Var, in which is also Platten-lake, thirty-five miles long, and seven or eight broad, abounding with fish, otters, and beavers, and surrounded with vine∣yards.</P>
<P>Strigova or Sidova, a town in the county of Szala-Var, seated in a pleasant valley, supposed to be the ancient Stridonium, where St. Jerom was born.</P>
<P>Glussingen, a walled town in the county of Ei∣senburg. It has a castle on a high rock, and is de∣lightfully situated amidst corn-fields, woods, and vineyards.</P>
<P>Steinam-Anger, another large populous town in the same county, where St. Martin, bishop of Tours, was born. Here also stood the Roman Sabaria.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="3520"/>
Gunz, a considerable town on a river of the same name, and in the same county as the two former. It has a castle, and is the seat of the high-court for the circle below the Danube. Its neighbouring hills are covered with vines.</P>
<P>Veszprin, a considerable open town, which is the see of a bishop, and gives name to a county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In UPPER-HUNGARY, which lies towards the east, on the borders of Poland, Transilvania, and Wa∣lachia, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Skepus, a castle, which gives name to a county of great extent, abounding in some parts with fruit∣ful corn fields, rich pastures, pulse, and flax, and in others with woods and mountains, some of which are among the loftiest of the Carpathian chain. No wine is made in any part of it, but it has some iron and copper mines. Near the castle of Ske∣pus is a cavern, in which all the winter the water is fluid, but in summer large quantities of ice is brought from it for cooling their liquors. The principal towns in the county, besides the mine∣towns, are Leutschau, Kasmark, and Lublyo. The two first are walled. Vitriol, or copperas, not only gushes out from the mines of this county, but breaks forth also from the surface of the ground. The village of Vockotz is fa∣mous for its medicinal springs.</P>
<P>Saros, a considerable town, having a castle, and giving name to a county, in which is also Eperies, on the river Tartsa, a large and well fortified town, with a Lutheran college. Here also is held the court of appeals for the circle on this side the Theis.</P>
<P>Zemplin, a town on the river Bodrogh, giving name to a county, in which are several other
<PB N="349" REF="3530"/>
towns, and a great many vineyards, yielding ex∣cellent wine, particularly that which takes its name from Tokay, a considerable town, plea∣santly situated near the conflux of the Theis and Bodrogh. Though the wine properly called To∣kay grows only on one mountain, yet that of the neighbouring country is very little, if at all, in∣ferior to it, and generally passes under the same name.</P>
<P>Ungh-Var, a strong town and fortress on the river Ungh, giving name to a county in which are some other towns.</P>
<P>Caschau, a royal free town on the river Hun∣dert, well fortified and built, but the air and wine are very bad. It is the capital of the coun∣ty of Aba-Ujvar, in which are several other large towns and castles.</P>
<P>Torna, an open little town, giving name to a county at the foot of the Carpathian mountains, in one of which, near the village of Szelitze, is a vast cavern, where the air is warm in winter, but cold in summer, in proportion to the heat and cold without. Hence, in winter it is the re∣treat of gnats, flies, bats, and owls, and even of hares and foxes; but in summer there are isicles in it as large as a cask, which begin to melt and waste away in Autumn.</P>
<P>Gomor, a small town on the river Sajo, giv∣ing name to a county, in which are Tsetneck, a large opulent town; Dobschau, noted for its iron, asbestos, cinnabar, and paper; Rosenau, a populous mine-town, and others.</P>
<P>Borsod, an open town, giving name to a coun∣ty, the capital of which is Miskoltz, a large popu∣lous town, noted for excellent wine.</P>
<P>Erlau or Eger, the see of a bishop, and a consi∣derable city, standing forty-five miles north-east of
<PB N="350" REF="3540"/>
Buda, and ninety-two east of Presburg. Here is a castle and warm bath, and in the neighbourhood are vineyards. The town is surrounded with old walls and bulwarks, and is the capital of the county of Heves, in which are several other towns. To this county is united that of the Jasi or Philisti, with Great Cumania. The principal town of the former is Jasz-Bereny, which is large and well built, and stands in a fertile country. The in∣habitants of Great-Cumania are descendants of the Cumani mentioned above, and enjoy parti∣cular privileges, as well as the Jasi. In Cuma∣nia are several towns, of which Kartzag seems to be the most considerable.</P>
<P>Poroslo, a large town, and the capital of the county of Szolnok.</P>
<P>Csongrad, a large town at the conflux of the Koros and Theis, giving name to a county, in which is also Szeged, a royal free town, at the con∣flux of the Maros and Theis, well fortified, and enjoying a good trade.</P>
<P>Munkats, a considerable town on the river La∣tortza, in the county of Boregh, with an almost impregnable castle.</P>
<P>Nagy-Szolos, a pleasant town, not far from the Theis. It is the capital of the county of Ugots.</P>
<P>Huszt, the principal town in the county of Maramarus, having a strong castle on a high rock above it. In the same county is another pretty good town called Szigeth, and some salt-works.</P>
<P>Kobar, the capital of a district on the frontiers of Transilvania.</P>
<P>Hadad, the capital of the county of Middle-Szolnok, having a castle.</P>
<P>Kraszna, an open town on a river of the same name, from whence a county is denominated.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="3550"/>
Szathmar, a town on an island in the river Sa∣mos, giving name to a county, and well fortified. Opposite to it is Nemethi, which in 1715 was united to it. Nagy-Karoly is another large town in this neighbourhood, with a stately castle.</P>
<P>Bathor, a considerable town in the county of Szabolts, in which are also seven towns, belonging to the Heyducks, and enjoying particular privi∣leges.</P>
<P>Great-Varadin, or Waradin, a well fortified city in the county of Bihar, being the see of a bishop, situate on the river Koros, an hundred and ten miles east of Buda. It has a strong castle on the east side, and the epithet of Great, to distinguish it from Little-Wara∣din, in the county of Chege. In that of Bihar is also Debretzen, a royal free town, large and populous. A heath extends from it upwards of thirty miles.</P>
<P>Halmogy, a town, with a small castle, on the river Koros. It is the capital of the county of Zarand.</P>
<P>Bekes, a town standing also on the river Koros, and giving name to a county.</P>
<P>Thurn, the capital of the Turuntal county.</P>
<P>Arad, the name of two towns, the Old and the New. The county in which they stand is denomi∣nated from them.</P>
<P>Csanad, an episcopal city on the river Maros, giving name to a county.</P>
<P>Temes-Var, a strong town on the river Beg, being the capital of the Bannat, or territory to which it gives name, and which (one small district ex∣cepted, that was ceded to the Turks, at the treaty of Belgrade, in 1739) belongs entirely to the em∣press-queen. There is another strong town in the Bannat, called Lugos, situated among mountains, besides others of less note.</P>

Mr. Keysler observes in regard to Hungary, that its tobacco is nearly equal to that of Turkey, and that there is a manufacture of it near Presburg, belonging to the imperial chamber at Hanburg, which brings in a very considerable revenue; not only the tobacco growing in the neighbourhood, but also that of the rest of Hungary being brought thither. He says, that blue is the most usual co∣lour worn by both sexes; that the dress of the Hun∣garian gentry is very becoming; that in the mine-towns the women's shifts are trimmed with rib∣bons, while others hang from their head-dress, down their backs; but that the clowns and pea∣sants, generally speaking, are meanly dressed; that the Hungarian horses are exceeding hardy, but have not strength sufficient for drawing a carriage in heavy soils, deep ways, or up an ascent; that the country in general is populous, and well culti∣vated, but the air in many places unhealthy; that the protestants are very numerous in Upper-Hun∣gary, especially in the country; and lastly, that there is a particular species of sheep there, with large twisted horns, about two feet in length, which are kept separate from the common sort.</P>

<HEAD>TRANSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country, a part of the antient Dacia, had its modern name from its situation, trans sylvas, i. e. beyond the woods or forests, which divide it from Hungary. The Germans call it Sie∣benburgen, from seven celebrated castles in it; and the Hungarians Erdely, which signifies a woody, mountainous country. It is said to be about an hundred and sixty miles from north to south, and an hundred and fifty from east to west, being bounded on the north by Hungary, Poland, and Moldavia, on the south by Walachia and the Ban∣nat of Temesvar, on the east by Moldavia, and on the west by Hungary. Its mountains yield gold, silver, iron, lead, copper, quicksilver, rock-salt, cinnabar, sulphur, vitriol, salt-petre, antimony, red ochre, isinglass, and other minerals, and several of them are clothed with vines. Many petrifying, salt, and medicinal springs, cold and hot, with a great variety of plants, are also found among them. The fields and vallies are rich and fertile, yielding corn, pulse, and fruits, and the forests abound with buffaloes, elks, stags, wild-goats, bears, fox∣es, martins, lynxes, ermines, beavers, wild-asses, wolves, bees, &amp;c. Vast numbers also of black cattle and horses are bred here. Of the latter there is a wild sort, with manes hanging down to the ground. The principal rivers are the Szamos, the Maros, and the Aluta. As to the inhabitants, they are of several sorts, as Hungarians, Saxons, Walachians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Rascians or Ser∣vians, and a people of Tartar origin, called Sekli. Here are also Jews and Zigduns, or gypsies, as in Hungary. In regard to religion, Roman catholics, protestants, Greeks, and Armenians, are all tolerated
<PB N="354" REF="3580"/>
here. The protestants are much more numerous than the Roman catholics. For a long time this country was chiefly governed by waywodes, set up and supported sometimes by the Turks, and sometimes by the emperors of Germany. In 1713 Michael Apaffi, the last of these waywodes, dying without issue, Transylvania was annexed to Hun∣gary, without regard to the claims of the Rakotzi family; and, since 1722, hath been made hereditary to the princes and princesses of the house of Au∣stria, whereas before the prince succeeded by free election. The states, like those of Hungary, con∣sist of the prelates or clergy, nobility, gentry, and royal towns: but each of the three nations, i. e. the Hungarians, Sikli or Sekli, and Saxons, have not only their separate districts, but differ widely in respect of their internal government, laws, cus∣toms, and constitutions: all, however, are sub∣ordinate to the prince and diet. The executive power is chiefly in the governor, and the council, appointed by the empress-queen out of the three nations above mentioned; for the others have no share in the government, nor such as are not of the Roman catholic, Calvinist, or Lutheran reli∣gions. The military establishment of Transylva∣nia consists, at present, only of six regiments, un∣der a commander in chief. The empress-queen draws a considerable revenue from it. In 1733 it paid no less than seventy thousand pounds to the extraordinary subsidy demanded by the emperor, which was double the sum paid by Stiria. The chief tribunal is that called the royal table, to which appeals lie from the inferior courts, and from it to the governor and council, and from thence to the sovereign. In church affairs, ap∣peals lie from the bishop to the archbishop of Co∣lotza, the pope's nuncio, and the court of Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="3590"/>
The principal places in the Hungarian districts, which comprehend the western parts of Transyl∣vania, are,</P>
<P>Clausenburg, a town, large, populous, and well fortified. Many of the inhabitants are Socinians.</P>
<P>Forda, an open, but large well built town, on the river Koros. The Hungarian language is said to be spoken here in great purity.</P>
<P>Vets, a fine town in the county of Tarda, in which is a plain where the emperor Trajan gained a signal victory over the Dacians under Decibalus.</P>
<P>Szent-Miklos, a fine town on the river Kukol∣lo, with two castles.</P>
<P>Torotzlo, a town famous for its iron and silver mines.</P>
<P>Karlsburg, a strong well built town, and the see of a bishop, on the river Maros. It was antiently a Roman colony, called Alba Julia, from Julia Au∣gusta, mother to the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.</P>
<P>Great-Schlatten, the chief of the metal-towns, as they are called, being seated amidst mines of gold and silver.</P>
<P>Varhely, antiently Sarmitz or Sarmizagefuza, where Trajan planted a Roman colony, calling it Ulpia Trajana. It was then the capital of Dacia, but is now inconsiderable. Coins, and other anti∣quities, are often found among the ruins.</P>
<P>Posteni, a strong fortification, defending the narrow pass, called the Iron-Gate.</P>
<P>In the territory of the Sikli, which lies in the north-east part of Transylvania, the principal places are, Csik-Szereda, Szent-Niklos, Kaszony, Kesdo-Va∣sarhely, Zabola, Szent-Gyorgy, Kereztur, Bar∣dutz, Udvarhely, Maros-Vasarihely, Bagyon, Szent-Mihaly.</P>
<P>In the five Saxon districts the chief towns are, Bistritz, Schesburg, Birthelm, Medwis, Raismark, Mullenbach, Bros, Hermenstadt, and Kronstadt.
<PB N="356" REF="3600"/>
The two last of these are large well fortified towns, especially Hermenstadt, which is reckoned the capital of the whole country. It stands on the river Cibin, an hundred and ninety-six miles east of Buda, and an hundred and fifty north-east of Bel∣grade. The air here is said to be very unhealthy. Kronstadt is forty-eight miles east of Hermenstadt, and a place of great trade. Birthelm is the resi∣dence of the protestant bishop.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>SCLAVONIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE country antiently comprehended under this name, extended from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, the Sclavi having over-run all these pro∣vinces; and, to this day, the languages spoken in them are all dialects or corruptions of the Sclavonic. Modern Sclavonia has the Drave on the north, and the Save on the south, terminating eastward on the Danube, and westward on Carniola, and extending about three hundred miles from east to west, and seventy from north to south, where broadest. It takes its name from the Sclavi, a Scythian nation, who, about the time of the emperor Justinian, possessed themselves of this and the neighbouring countries. The inhabitants are a mixture of Scla∣vonians, Croats, Walachians, Germans, Venetians, Turks, Servians or Rascians, and Hungarians. Sclavonia was long subject to the Venetians, after∣wards to the Turks, by whom the greatest part of it was ceded to the house of Austria, at the treaty of Carlowitz. In 1746 it was united to Hungary by the empress-queen. The states send representatives to the diets of Hungary, and have also diets of
<PB N="357" REF="3610"/>
their own. A viceroy, or ban, presides over Sclavonia, jointly with Croatia and part of Dalma∣tia. Some say that the word slave took its rise from the tyranny exercised by the Venetians to∣wards the people of this country, when under their dominion. The air is pleasant and temperate, the face of the country level, and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, and pasture. The only religion pub∣licly tolerated, is the Roman catholic; yet there are many of the Greek church. To the extraor∣dinary subsidies granted to the emperor it pays as much as Tyrol, viz. ten thousand pounds. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Essek, a considerable town on the river Drave, near its influx into the Danube, eighty-seven miles north-west from Belgrade, and an hundred and three south-east from Buda. It was particular∣ly remarkable once for a wooden bridge, erected by the Turks over the Danube and some morasses, which was near eight miles in length, and thirty yards in breadth, with rails on each side, watch∣towers at every quarter of a mile's distance, and stairs leading down to the marshes; but this bridge was destroyed by the Imperialists in their late wars with the Turks, who used to invade Hungary by it.</P>
<P>Zalankemen, a walled town, with a castle, op∣posite to which the Theis falls into the Danube.</P>
<P>Peterwardein, a strong town on the Danube, op∣posite to Belgrade. In its neighbourhood prince Eugene obtained a great victory over the Turks in 1716.</P>
<P>Carlowitz, on the banks of the Danube, six miles north-west of Peterwardein, and thirty-four of Belgrade. It is noted for a treaty of peace con∣cluded here, in 1698, betwixt the emperor, the czar of Muscovy, the king of Poland, and the Vene∣tians, on the one part, and the Turks on the
<PB N="358" REF="3620"/>
other. Here the Greek bishop of Sclavonia resides, and the neighbourhood is noted for good red wine.</P>
<P>Mitrowitz, a town on the Save, where antiently stood Sirmium, the capital of Illyricum.</P>
<P>Gradisk, a strong town on the Save.</P>
<P>Several regiments of horse and foot are quartered in this country to guard the frontiers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CROATIA.</HEAD>
<P>CROATIA, a part of the antient Illyricum, is bounded on the east by Sclavonia and Bosnia; on the west by Stiria and Carniola; on the south and south-west by Morlachia; and on the north by the Drave, which parts it from a part of Sclavonia. It is about eighty miles in length, and seventy in breadth, and was once di∣vided between the Hungarians and Turks, but now the greatest part of it is subject to the house of Austria. The Croats derive their origin from the Sclavi, and their language is a dialect of the Scla∣vonian, approaching very near to that of the Poles. The country is divided into two parts, viz. that under, and that beyond the Save. In the late wars between the empress queen and the king of Prussia, it is said that no less than fifty thousand men were raised in this country, and twenty thousand in Scla∣vonia. Both horse and foot are good soldiers, es∣pecially the former, serving for much the same purposes as the hussars, pandours, and other ir∣regulars. The soil, where cultivated, is fruitful in wine and oil, and many other products; but be∣ing
<PB N="359" REF="3630"/>
a frontier country, and much exposed to in∣roads, it is not so well cultivated as it otherwise would be, which is also the case with Sclavonia. Here is one bishopric, but no universities, and the only towns worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Warasdin, a royal free town on the Drave, near which is a castle and warm bath.</P>
<P>Zagrab, a royal free city on the Save, being the capital of the whole country, and the see of a bi∣shop.</P>
<P>Kartstadt, a fortified town between the rivers Kulpa and Corona.</P>
<P>Petrina, a fortified town between the Kulpa and Petrina.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>DALMATIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country had its name from its antient capital Delmium, or Delminium, which was destroyed by the Romans in the year of the city 597. In the fifteenth century the Venetians re∣duced the whole country, but at present are masters only of the chief maritime places. The Austrians, Turks, and Ragusans, share the rest of it amongst them. The language and customs of the inhabitants are Sclavonian, and their religion the Roman catholic. The mountains are covered with olives, vines, and myrtles, or flocks of sheep, and lined with gold and silver ore. The plains are fertile, and feed abundance of cattle. Under Dalmatia is included Morlachia, a country full of high mountains, in length about sixty miles, and in breadth eighty, being a part of the antient Liburnia. The inha∣bitants are of Walachian extraction; for the name
<PB N="360" REF="3640"/>
of the country is a contraction of Mauro-Walachia, that is, Black Walachia; and the Walachians, it is said, are the descendants of the Roman colonies that were antiently planted in these countries. There is a people in this country and Carniola, called Us∣cocks, a rough savage race, much addicted to ra∣pine, and noted for their agility, skipping like goats among the mountains, from rock to rock. Their language is Walachian, and their religion the Greek, or something like it. The principal places belonging to the Austrians in Dalmatia are,</P>
<P>Bukari, a pretty good town, with a harbour, on bay of the Adriatic.</P>
<P>Zengh, a royal free town, and the see of a bi∣shop, situate near the Adriatic, and having two forts or castles, with a governor and garrison, but a very indifferent harbour. Towards the land are some bleak barren mountains. The bishop is suf∣fragan to the archbishop of Spolatro.</P>
<P>Modrus, an antient well built town on the Leako, and the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>The principal places belonging to the Venetians are,</P>
<P>Nona, which is a well fortified town, and a bishop's see, and has a harbour, being almost sur∣rounded by the sea. In the neighbourhood is a lake.</P>
<P>Lara, the see of an archbishop, and the capital of Venetian Dalmatia. It stands one hundred and fifty miles from Venice, on a small peninsula or island, for it is separated from the land only by a deep ditch, into which the sea flows at high water, un∣der a draw-bridge. Here is a capacious harbour, and a citadel in which the proveditor, or governor, of Dalmatia resides, and the town is otherwise so well fort fied, that it is deemed impregnable. To supply the want of fresh water, the rain is care∣fully
<PB N="361" REF="3650"/>
preserved in cisterns. The cathedral is dedi∣cated to old Simeon, who took the child Jesus in his arms, and whose body, they pretend, is still preserved in it. The city is very antient, and contains many magnificent structures, particularly the archbishop's palace, the arsenal, the magazines, convents, hospitals, barracks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Aurana, a fortified town, and one of the most delightful in Dalmatia, being situate on a lake of the same name, and having large suburbs.</P>
<P>Novigrad, a small town, with a castle, on a bay of the Adriatic.</P>
<P>Tenen, a fortified town, and a bishop's see, near the frontiers of Bosnia.</P>
<P>Sebenico, a very strong town on the Adriatic, one hundred and ninety miles from Venice. It has a spacious port, and four castles, and is also the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>Trau, a well fortified town, and the see of a bi∣shop, pleasantly situated on a peninsula, which is joined to the island of Bua, on one side, by a stone bridge, and to the continent, on the other, by three wooden ones, over a canal cut across the isthmus. Here is a fine harbour, and a Venetian provedi∣tor.</P>
<P>Clissa, a strong town on an eminence. In the neighbourhood are a great many vine and olive∣yards, with a very important pass, leading from Turkey into Dalmatia.</P>
<P>Salona, or Salonae, at present a small place on the gulph, but antiently the capital of Illyricum, and a Roman colony, noted for its purple, its helmets, coats of mail, &amp;c. It was also the sta∣tion of the Roman fleet for the Adriatic, and the place to which Dioclesian frequently retired. The Roman colony was sent hither by Tiberius, who named it Martia Julia.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="3660"/>
Spolatro, a well fortified town, and the see of an archbishop, primate of Dalmatia and Croatia. The remains of Dioclesian's palace here are worth seeing. It has a spacious harbour, and is the place whence all the merchandize brought from Turkey, is exported to Venice and other parts of Italy.</P>
<P>Almissa, the antient Peguntium, stands at the mouth of the Tettina, and is the see of a bishop. It was formerly noted for piracy.</P>
<P>Narenta, or Narenza, antiently called Naro, Nerona, Narbona. It is now an inconsiderable place, but was formerly a strong town, governed by a pro-consul.</P>
<P>Citluch, a well fortified town, with large suburbs.</P>
<P>Castel Nuovo, a strongly fortified town, on a high rock, adjoining to the sea.</P>
<P>Rhisano, the see of a bishop, with a castle on an almost inaccessible rock.</P>
<P>Cattaro, a town well fortified, and a bishop's see.</P>
<P>The principal islands belonging to the Venetians on the coast of Dalmatia are,</P>
<P>Osero, Cherso, Vegia, Arbe, Pago, Lantano, Pasma, Isola Longa, Brazza, Lesina, Lissa, and Corzola Nigra, or Corcyra. Most of them take their names from the principal place in them, enjoy a good air, have some commodious harbours, and are fruitful in wine, olives, melons, and figs. Corcyra abounds in wood and wine, and its capital of the same name is well fortified, and has a fine harbour. Pago is noted for salt.</P>

<HEAD>RAGUSA and its TERRITORY.</HEAD>
<P>RAGUSA is a small republic, which, in its constitution, much resembles Venice, the government being almost entirely in the hands of the nobles. The chief magistrate is stiled rector, answering to the Venetian doge, except that he is changed every month. Here also are several coun∣cils, of which that of the pregadi has the chief direction of affairs. To guard the city against contagious distempers here is a board of health, consisting of five nobles. It is said of the Ragu∣sans, that they pay tribute to the Turks out of fear, to the Venetians out of hatred, and to the emperor, Spain, the pope, and Naples, out of re∣spect, and from political views. They are so jealous of their neighbours, that the gates of the city are allowed to be open only a few hours in the day. Their chief protector is the grand seignior, to whom they pay an annual tribute of twenty thou∣sand zequins. The languages spoken here are the Italian and Sclavonian. The established religion is the Roman catholic; but those of the Turks, Greeks, and Armenians are tolerated. The only place of any note in their territory is that from which the republic takes its name, which was antiently called Epidaurus. At present it is a small, but well built town, standing on the sea∣coast, in a wholesome air, but barren soil, and hav∣ing a good harbour, with several manufactures, and a considerable trade. It is also the see of an archbishop, and some small fertile islands in the Adriatic belong to it.</P>
<P>In Turkish Dalmatia are several considerable towns, viz. Scardona, Kliuno, Herzegowina, Ma∣ster, Medon, and Alessio, antiently Lissus or Lis∣sum,
<PB N="264" REF="3680"/>
where the brave Scanderbeg died, and was buried, in the year 1467. Medon stands on the Lago de Scutari. Scardona stands on the river Kerka, is well fortified, and the see of a bishop, but was antiently more considerable than at pre∣sent. Herzegowina also is well fortified and spa∣cious, and the residence of the Turkish beglerbeg. Trebigne, though the see of a bishop, and formerly the capital of a province, is but a mean place; and so are Great and Little Melanto, which lie upon the sea coast.</P>

<P>THIS country is bounded to the south by Savoy, the Milanese, and the territories of Venice; to the north by Swabia; to the east by the county of Tyrol, a part of Austria and Swabia; and to the west by the Sandgau, Burgundy, and the country of Gex; lying between the 6th and 11th degree of east long. and between the 45th and 48th degree of north lat. being about two hundred and sixty miles in length, and one hundred in breadth.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>That part of the canton of Bern, to the east of the lake of Geneva, together with the cantons of Uri, Switz, Underwald, Glaris, Appenzel, and part of the canton of Lucern, consist of stupen∣dous
<PB N="366" REF="3700"/>
mountains, whose tops are said to be from nine to twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea, consisting of craggy inaccessible rocks, of which some are quite bare, while others are always covered with ice and snow. Among the mountains are many excellent medicinal and other springs, cold and warm baths, water-falls, craggy precipices, deep narrow vallies, and ca∣verns. They yield also a great variety of herbs, thickets, and bushes, in the upper parts; and, in the lower, rich pastures and woods. The highest are those in the canton of Uri. Many of the vallies are covered with lakes, or watered by brooks and rivers. In some of them are towns, villages, woods, vineyards, and corn lands. Both on the moun∣tains, and in the vallies, the air is extremely cold in winter; but in summer it is very pleasant, cool, and refreshing on the former, but excessive hot in the latter. Sometimes it is winter on the north∣side of a mountain, when it is summer on the other; nay flowers may be gathered sometimes with one hand, and snow with the other. Prodigious masses of ice and snow often fall from them in winter, and do a great deal of damage; and most of the streams and rivers take their rise from the thawing of the ice and snow on their sides and tops. From the rising or descending of the clouds, with which they are commonly enveloped, the inhabitants can, for the most part, pretty exactly foretel the changes of the weather, so that they serve them instead of weather glasses. The other and lower parts of Switzerland are very pleasant and fertile, being diversified with vineyards, corn-fields, meadows, and pasture-grounds. The mountains in these are but mole-hills in comparison of the others: there is neither snow nor ice on them in summer, and they frequently afford not only good pasturage, but arable ground. Many petrifactions are found both
<PB N="367" REF="3710"/>
among these and the others, with a variety of fos∣sils, as chalk, mundic, several sorts of clay, terra sigillata, sulphur, slate, marble of various colours, common gypsum, spar, chrystal, sandstone, salt∣petre, rock-salt, turf, and pit-coal. The sands of the rivers yield gold-dust, particularly those of the Rhine, the Emmet, the Aare, the Reusz, the Adda, and the Goldbach. The metals of this country being generally found to be brittle, the only mines that are worked are a few iron ones. In the lower parts of Switzerland they sow rye, oats, barley, spelt, flax, and hemp. Wines of various sorts are also produced in some of them, with apples, pears, nuts, cherries, plumbs, and chesnuts; and those that lie towards Italy abound in peaches, morels, almonds, figs, citrons, and pomegranates. Of wood for fuel, and other uses, there is generally plenty; in some places, however, they are obliged to burn sheeps dung, and in others a kind of heath and small shrubs. In the vallies, they cultivate saffron with good success. The Switzers derive their princi∣pal subsistence from their flocks and herds of cattle, which in summer graze upon the mountains. Their cheese is much esteemed, especially that of Bern and Griers, in the canton of Freyburg. Great numbers of horses also are bred here, and bought up for the French cavalry. Chamois goats are common on the mountains and also marmousets, which in Latin are called mures alpini, i. e. Alpine mice, but in reality are a kind of badgers. There are wild fowls of several sorts, particularly a large kind of eagle. The foxes are white or yellow; and of the hares some turn white in winter, so that they can scarce be distinguished from the snow. Be∣sides the abovementioned rivers, the Rhone and the Tesin have their sources in this country. The lakes are very numerous; but the chief are those of
<PB N="368" REF="3720"/>
Geneva, Neufchattel, Biel, Zurich, Thun, Brien, Constance, and Lucern. Both rivers and lakes abound with fish, and afford a cheap water-car∣riage. Switzerland is not so populous as many other countries in Europe; and the popish cantons less so than the protestant. The total number of the inhabitants is computed at two millions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The language generally spoken here is the Ger∣man, in which also all public affairs are transacted; but in those parts of the country that border on Italy or France, a corrupt French or Italian pre∣vails. The two predominant religions are Cal∣vinism and popery. Of the former are the cantons of Zurich and Bern, the towns of St. Gall, Ge∣neva, Muhlhausen, and Biel, the principality of Neufchatel, the greater part of Basil, Schaff∣hausen, the country of the Grisons, the Thurgau, Toggenburg, Glaris, and the Rhine valley, the fron∣tiers of Appenzel, with a small part of Solothurn, and some places in the countries of Baden and Sar∣gans. The rest of the Swiss cantons, allies, and dependants are popish. For the education of youth there is an university at Basil, and aca∣demies at Zurich, Bern, Lausanne, and Geneva, besides gymnasiums and scholae illustres, both in the popish and Swiss cantons. There are also so∣cieties among them for the improvement of the German language, and the sciences. Some Swit∣zers have distinguished themselves in the fine arts, especially in painting and engraving; but there are but few of them that have been remarkable for their extensive learning and deep erudition, or their fine taste for polite literature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="369" REF="3730"/>
<HEAD>MANUFACTURES and TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to manufactures, the principal are snuff and tobacco, linen of several sorts, lace, thread, silk and worsted stockings, neckcloths, cotton stuffs, gloves, handkerchiefs, silks of several sorts, gold and silver brocades, a variety of woollen manu∣factures, hats, paper, leather of all sorts, earthern wares, porcelain, toys, watches, clocks, and other hardwares, &amp;c. The trade of Switzerland is greatly promoted by many navigable lakes and rivers. In some of the above manufactures, and in cheese, butter, sheep, horses, black cattle, hides and skins, the exports are considerable; and as the imports are chiefly grain and salt, with some American and Asiatic goods, there is probably a large balance in their favour. In some parts of Switzerland dress is restrained by sumptuary laws.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>The Swiss were antiently called Helvitii. After they were defeated by Marius they retired into their own country, where they lived peaceably till the time of Julius Caesar, who obliged them again to submit to the Roman yoke, under which they con∣tinued till the declension of that empire, when they became a part of the kingdom of Burgundy. After that they fell under the dominion of the Franks; then of the Germans; but being op∣pressed by the latter, they threw off the yoke, and erected several states or republics, which, at the treaty of Westphalia in 1648, were recognized as free and independent. The cantons of Switz, Uri, and Underwald, having, so early as the year 1308, entered into a confederacy in the canton of Switz, and having also obtained their first victory
<PB N="370" REF="3740"/>
in 1315, over Leopold, archduke of Austria, in the same canton, its name was given to the whole con∣federacy, which it still retains. The other can∣tons successively acceded to this association, but some of them not until upwards of an hundred years after. With respect to the government and con∣stitution of these cantons, some of them are aris∣tocracies, and some democracies. In the former both the legislative and executive power is lodged in the burghers or citizens of the capital of each canton; and of these there are seven, viz. Zurich, Bern, Basil, Friburg, Solothurn, and Schaff hausen. In the others the legislative power is lodged in the whole body of the people; and every male above sixteen, whether master or servant, has a vote in making laws, and in the choice of magistrates. For what concerns the whole Helvetic body, there are diets ordinary and extraordinary: the former are held annually and the others upon particular emergen∣cies; and both are summoned by the city of Zurich, which appoints the time and place of their meetings. Besides the general diets, since the reformation, there have been particular diets of the two religions, at which all public affairs of consequence, that regard the two parties, are treated separate∣ly; for tho' a sense of their common interests obliges them to study to maintain the league and union, yet it is certain, that the mutual confidence between the cantons is in some measure lost, through the zeal of each party for their particular opinions, especially of the Roman catholics. The annual general diets are held always at Frauenfeld, or Baden, principally to regulate the affairs of the common bailiages. Lucern takes the lead of the Roman catholic cantons, being the most powerful of that deno∣mination; but Zurich, though less powerful than that of Bern, takes the precedence of all the other cantons, both protestant and popish. These can∣tons
<PB N="371" REF="3750"/>
do not make one commonwealth, but are so many independent states, united together by strict alliances for their mutual defence. The extraordinary diets or congresses are held at Al∣dorf. Each canton usually deputes two envoys, both to the ordinary and extraordinary; to which also the abbot and town of St. Gall, and the town of Biel, send representatives as allies. To the thirteen cantons belong, in common, twenty-one bailiages, two towns, and two lordships. The allies or incorporated places, as they are call∣ed, are the abbot and town of St. Gall, the three Grison Leagues, the republic of the Valais, the towns of Muhlhausen and Biel, the principality of Neuenberg or Neufchatel, Geneva, and the bishop of Basil. Of these the abbot and town of St. Gall, and the town of Biel, are regarded as members of the Helvetic body, but the rest only as allies.</P>

<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the public revenues, they are in general very inconsiderable, arising chiefly from the usual regalia, appropriated every where to the sovereign, the demesnes, and public granaries, vo∣luntary contributions, the sale of salt, and a land∣tax; in the protestant cantons from the church∣lands also that were seized at the reformation. Ex∣cept in Zurich, Bern, Basil, and Schaffhausen, where the people are more industrious, have a greater trade, and are richer than in the others, they defray the ordinary charges, and that is all.</P>

<HEAD>FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The cantons never kept any standing troops, except for a few garrisons; but their militia is reckoned to be the best regulated of any in Europe.
<PB N="372" REF="3760"/>
Every male from sixteen to sixty is enrolled, and about one third of them regimented. They must all provide themselves with arms, cloathing, and accoutrements, and appear on the stated days for exercise; and the several cantons and districts must be furnished with a sufficient train of artillery, and all the other implements of war. The Switzers of the several cantons are allowed to engage in the service of such foreign princes and states as are in alliance with those cantons, or with whom they have made a previous agreement. Such states, paying an annual subsidy to the respective cantons, are al∣lowed to make levies. Every man enlists voluntari∣ly, and for what number of years they please; at the expiration of which they are at liberty to return home. A great many thus always returning from foreign service, Switzerland is never unprovided with able and experienced officers and soldiers. With respect to their character, they are a brave, honest, hospitable, hardy people; very true to their engagements, friendly, and humane. In short, there is not a people in Europe whose national character is better. In their persons they are generally tall, robust, and well made, but their com∣plexions are none of the best, and those that live in the neighbourhood of the mountains are subject to wens. The women are said to be generally hand∣some and well shaped, sensible and modest, yet frank, easy, and agreeable in conversation. Few of the peasants are miserably poor, and many of them rich, especially in the protestant cantons, and that of Bern in particular. We now proceed to a particular description of the several cantons, accord∣ing to their rank, after which will follow that of their common bailiages and incorporated territories.</P>

<HEAD>ZURICH.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is bounded to the north by Swabia and the canton of Schaff hausen, to the south by the town and territory of Rapperschweil and the cantons of Switz and Zug, to the east by the Thur∣gau, Toggenburg, and Utznach, and to the west by the free bailiages and county of Baden. It is about sixty miles from north to south, and forty-eight from east to west. This canton, with respect to its face, air, and soil, is said to be an epitome of all Switzerland, as containing in it hills, vallies, plains, corn-lands, vineyards, lakes, and rivers. Their wines have a tartness at first, but the longer they are kept the more agreeable they are. The other products are excellent fruits, corn, pasture, fine clay, chalk, several coloured earths, pit-coal, turf, and sulphur. There are also some mineral springs in the canton, and of the lakes that of Zurich is the most conside∣rable. The reformation was introduced here by Zwinglius, in the year 1517. Religious matters are under the direction of an ecclesiastical council, and a synod. There are an hundred and fifty ministers in the canton, divided into ten deanries. It is the first in rank, and inferior only to that of Bern in extent, power, and wealth; in conse∣quence of which, its representatives preside in the general diets, when held in any place belonging in common to the cantons, and the affairs relating to the whole confederacy are transacted in its offices. Its quota, for the defence of the several members of the confederacy, is fourteen hundred men. Of one of the two armies raised on these occasions, it nominates one of the commanders in chief, as Lu∣cern does the other. Its revenue is said to be about an hundred and fifty thousand crowns a-year, of which, one year with another, two-thirds are expend∣ed
<PB N="374" REF="3780"/>
in the charges of government, and the rest laid up in the treasury. It can bring fifty thousand fighting men into the field, at a very short warning. Of the bailiwics into which it is divided, eighteen are called the inward, and eighteen the outward. Over each of the former there are two bailiffs, who hold their employments during life, officiate by turns, and reside in the city, visiting their baili∣wics only at certain times, for the holding of courts. In the latter the bailiffs reside constantly, and hold their office only for six, nine, or at most twelve years. Here are also twenty secularized convents that are called bailiages, but without any jurisdiction annexed to them. The principal places in the canton are,</P>
<P>Zurich, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal, standing in a pleasant country, near where the river Aa issues from the lake that takes its name from the town, twenty-three miles from Schaff∣hausen, and an hundred and fourteen from Geneva. After having been ruined by Attila, the Hun, it is said to have been restored by Thuricus, son of The∣odoric, king of the Goths, from whom it took the name of Thuricum, corrupted afterwards into that of Zurich. The river divides it into two parts, and has two bridges over it. It is fortified in the mo∣dern way, and has wide ditches, faced with free stone. There are five arsenals in it, well stored with arms and artillery; an academy or college, having fifteen professors; a museum, or chamber of rarities; a stately town-house, the pillars in the front of which are of black marble, streaked with white; and a town-library. The Platz and Lindenhof are two pleasant walks, planted with lime-trees. The sovereignty and administration of all affairs are lodged in the greater and lesser council, out of which are chosen the city-officers, as the councils are out of the thirteen companies of
<PB N="375" REF="3790"/>
burghers. There are several other councils or col∣leges, each of which has its particular department. Here are a great variety of silk, woollen, linen, cot∣ton, and other manufactures, this being the place of the greatest trade in all Switzerland. Before the reformation, there was an abbey for ladies in this town, whose abbess had the title of princess; the large revenues of which are now applied mostly to pious and charitable uses. The town is well supplied with provisions by and from its lake. The streets are neat, and houses well built, but not magnificent. The college here hath produced some learned men, particularly Zwinglius and Bullinger. In the town∣library are several letters to Bullinger, from lady Jane Gray, daughter to the duke of Suffolk. In one of the arsenals is the figure of William Tell, dressed and armed in the antient Swiss manner, with the cross-bow, whence he shot the arrow that struck the apple off of his child's head. The unmarried women here are distinguished from the married, by a particular knot of ribbons on their heads, and the men are generally dressed in black; for the young only are allowed to wear coloured stuffs, and those quite plain, gold, silver, and jewels, being forbid, and luxury and vanity, of every kind, carefully guarded against. When they go to church, the men all wear bands, and, when in mourning, bonnets made of pasteboard, covered with crape. Both men and women are so fond of music, that there is few of them that cannot play on some instrument. If a burgher goes out of town, or a peasant enters it, without a sword, they are liable to be fined. No persons, whatever their rank or office may be, are exempted from the sumptuary laws. The burgomasters, who are the same as the advoyers at Bern, have the title of ex∣cellence. The hospitals here are very neat, and well endowed; but they do not affect the ridicu∣lous
<PB N="376" REF="3800"/>
vanity of lodging the poor in palaces. Not only in this town and canton, and other parts of Switzerland, but also among the Grisons, the mi∣nisters all preach covered. The country about the town is very pleasant and fruitful, for both which it is not a little indebted to the lake, that extends twenty-four miles in length, and about two or three in breadth. The water is of a green colour, supposed to be owing to the melted snow that falls into it from the adjacent mountains. That part of it next Zurich, is called the Lower-lake, and the other end, the Upper. The cathedral, or great church here, is collegiate. Among the archives of the dean and chapter are many folios of letters, to and from Bullenger, relating to the Reforma∣tion. The present city is said to owe its origin to a nunnery, founded by the emperor Lewis I. near where the antient Tigurum stood. At the village of Waugen near it is a spring, called Hunger∣brunn, which is said to flow plentifully before a scarcity, though dry at all other times.</P>
<P>Horgen, a large market town on the lake, with a good harbour.</P>
<P>Regenstorf, a village, which gives name to a bailiwic, in which stood formerly the castle of Old Regensberg, the original seat of the barons of Re∣gensberg, who are so famous in the history of Swit∣zerland, and were proprietors of the greatest part of the country about Zurich.</P>
<P>Meilen, a town on the lake of Zurich, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Kyburg, a castle, which now gives name to a bailiwic, as it did antiently to a county, the counts of which were very powerful, and resided here.</P>
<P>Pfeffikon, a large market-town, situated on the lake that takes its name from it.</P>
<P>Elg, a large country town, giving name to a bailiwic, which was antiently a lordship.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="3810"/>
Regensberg, Bulach, Andelsingen, and Eglesau, small towns, giving names to bailiwics. The last is situated on the north side of the Rhine, and rec∣koned a very important pass.</P>
<P>Lauffen, a village on the Rhine, about a league below Schaffhausen, where the river precipitates itself from rocks an hundred and twenty feet in height. Goods therefore that are brought down the Rhine, are taken out above Lauffen, and em∣barked again below it.</P>
<P>Greiffensee, a small town, but the capital of a bailiwic, situated on the lake to which it gives name, which is about five miles long, and half as broad.</P>
<P>Gruningen, a small town, but the capital of a bailiwic. Here is a fine castle, in which the bai∣liff resides, and the church has several beautiful tombs in it. At the village of Babiken, in this bailiwic, is a house of the Teutonic order.</P>
<P>Lower-Lunneren, a small village, in the baili∣wic of Knonau, where, in 1741, many curious re∣mains of Roman antiquities were found. In the same bailiwic, Albis, a very lofty mountain, has its beginning, whose sides are covered with woods, and on whose top are two watch-towers.</P>
<P>Stein-am-Rhein, a town on the Celler-Lake, where the Rhine issues from it. This town, in 1484, put itself under the protection of Zurich, but with a reserve of all its liberties and privileges. It stands on the Swabian side of the Rhine, over which it has a bridge. Above it, on an eminence, is a watch-tower. Before the Reformation there was also a rich Benedictine convent here, whose revenues are now collected by a bailiff appointed by Zurich.</P>
<P>Winterthur, a town in a pleasant plain on the river Eulach, fifteen miles north-east of Zurich. Like Stein, it is governed by its own burgomaster and laws, under the sovereignty of Zurich, which,
<PB N="378" REF="3820"/>
in case of a war, it furnishes with two hundred men. It is noted for a beautiful earthen ware, and painted stoves.</P>
<P>Among the lakes in this canton is a small one, called Widensee, which produces little turtles, the flesh of which is not disagreeable.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BERN.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is bounded to the north by the cantons of Basil and Solothurn, and the Austrian Forest-towns; to the south by the lake of Geneva, the Valais and duchy of Savoy; to the east by Uri, Underwald, Lucern, and the county of Baden; and to the west by Solothurn, Neufchatel, Franche-Comté, the district of Biel, and the land of Gex. It is the most fruitful, the richest, and by much the largest of all the cantons, extending in length about sixty leagues, and about thirty where broadest. It yields not only plenty of grain, fruit, and pa∣sture, but also a good wine, a variety of coloured earths and clays, sand-stone, mundick, gypsum, pit-coal, sulphur, and iron-ore. Here likewise are large herds of cattle, great and small; and, in consequence of that, great quantities of milk, but∣ter, and cheese. The rivers that water this canton are the Aar, the Emmat, the Wigger, the Aaa, the Rusz, the Limmat, the Sanen, the Sensen, and the Kandel. The principal lake is that of Geneva, the length of which is about eighteen leagues, and the greatest breadth between three and four. The depth in some places is near four hundred fathom, in others not above forty. The Rhone enters it at the east end, near Bouveret, and issues out again at the west, close by Geneva. In summer its waters are much swelled by the melting of the snow on the mountains. This lake, however, is not entire∣ly surrounded by the territory of Bern, but partly
<PB N="379" REF="3830"/>
by Savoy and the country of Gex; the former of which belongs to the king of Sardinia, and the latter to France, and the territory of Sion. Its bor∣ders are extremely fertile and beautiful, being much embellished with vineyards, which yield excellent wine, and interspersed with towns and villages, be∣twixt which a considerable commerce is carried on. The other great lakes, that are wholly or partly within this canton, are those of Neufchatel, Biel, Murte, Thun, Brien, and Halwyl, which all abound in fish, particularly that of Geneva, where trouts are sometimes caught weighing forty or fifty pounds. In that of Biel, called also the Nydau∣lake, are two small islands, one of which is very beautiful. This lake is about three leagues in length, and one in breadth. Along the whole west and north-west sides of the canton runs that chain of mountains, called by the general name of Jura; but the several mountains of which it is com∣posed, have all their particular names. This can∣ton is well cultivated, and very populous, the number of its subjects being computed at four hun∣dred thousand. German is the prevailing language, but almost all the people of fashion speak either French or Italian; even the common people in the Pais de Vaud, and other places, that lie towards France or Italy, speak a corrupt French or Italian, or a jargon composed of both. The established reli∣gion here, and the other protestant cantons, is Calvinism, the same both in doctrine and disci∣pline as in Holland; nor is any other tolerated, except in the common bailiages, and the vale of Frick. The ministers are divided into deaneries and classes, and hold yearly chapters or synods. They are kept in a greater dependence on the civil power here, than in the other cantons, and not suffered to interfere with matters of state. The city of Bern first joined the consederacy in the
<PB N="380" REF="3840"/>
year 1353. Towards the defence thereof the can∣ton now furnishes two thousand men. Every male, from sixteen to sixty, is inrolled in the militia, and about a third of them regimented. There are of∣ficers for every district, whose province it is to see that the men be regularly exercised; that their arms, ammunition, and cloathing, be in good condition; and that they be kept in a constant readiness to march. Once a-year they are drawn out to a gene∣ral review. The same attention is paid to those that belong to the train of artillery. Some regiments con∣sist of married, and some of unmarried men; some of foot, others of dragoons. There is also one regi∣ment and a troop of cuirassiers. The latter con∣sists entirely of burghers of Bern. Both the horse∣men and footmen find their horses, arms, and ac∣coutrements. Besides the arms and artillery in the arsenal at Bern, all the castles, where the country governors or bailiffs reside, are well furnished with them. At Bern is a constant guard or garrison of two hundred men, and a small garrison at fort Arburg. In the same city is also an office, which grants licences for levies to foreign powers, and where the recruits make their appearance, and are registered. The bailiffs have the chief direc∣tion of affairs in their several districts, being gene∣rals of the militia, and presiding in the courts of justice; but, in civil causes, above a certain value, an appeal lies from them to Bern; and, in capital causes, their sentence must be confirmed by the great council before it can be executed. When any bailiwic is to be disposed of, as many balls as there are competitors are put into a bag, whereof one is gilt, and he that draws that has the bailiwic.</P>
<P>Mr. Keysler observes, that the wealthiest pea∣sants in Switzerland are those of Bern; it being difficult to find a village without one, at least, who is worth between twenty and thirty thousand guil∣ders,
<PB N="381" REF="3850"/>
and sometimes even sixty thousand. He says, the common people of both sexes wear straw hats, and that the women's petticoats are tied up so near their armpits, that hardly an hand's-breadth is left for their shape; that the inns, not only in this canton but throughout Switzerland are in general, very good; that the manners of the people were, in many respects, greatly changed within fifty years before he visited them, which was about thirty years ago, and consequently must be much more so now; that, instead of the plainness and honest simplicity of their ancestors, the love of superfluities and high living greatly prevailed; that luxury, pomp, and that infatuation for foreign productions, which had infected most parts of Europe, had also extended its contagious influence to Switzerland, though not to such a degree as in many other countries. Dr. Burnet says, that drinking is so common, and produces so many quarrels and disorders, that the bailiffs not only subsist by the fines payable for them, but often get estates, carrying, perhaps, twenty thousand crowns, at the end of five years, to Bern; that their law is short and clear, insomuch that the most intricate suit is ended after two, or perhaps three hearings, either in the first in∣stance, before the bailiff, or in the second, at Bern; that the civility expressed in this country to women, at first meeting them, is not by saluting them, but shaking them by the hand, and that none but strangers take off their hats to them. Mr. Addison says, that the peasants are generally cloathed in a coarse kind of canvas, the manufacture of the country, and that their holiday cloaths go from father to son; so that it is not uncommon to see a countryman in his great grandfather's doublet and breeches; that the belief of witchcraft prevailed among them so much, that there were some exe∣cutions on that account while he was in the country;
<PB N="382" REF="3860"/>
that the question, or torture, is used not only is this canton but all over Switzerland; that though the subjects of the state are rich, the public is poor; and though they could oppose a sudden invasion, yet that their unkindly soil requires such a number of hands to cultivate it, that they could not spare the reinforcements and recruits that would be neces∣sary in a long war. Upon extraordinary occasions, however, they boast that they could raise eighty thousand men in twenty-four hours. This can∣ton is divided into the German country, that is, that part of the canton in which the German tongue is spoken, and which is also called the antient can∣ton, extending from Morat to the county of Ba∣den; and the Roman, called also the Waal, and Pais de Vaud. In the former of these, which con∣tains thirty-five bailiwics, and about three hun∣dred parishes, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Bern, which gives name to the whole canton, and is its capital. It is said that the taking of a bear on the day on which the foundation of this city was laid, gave occasion to its name, hence it is often in Latin called Arctopolis, i. e. the city of the Bear, and has a bear for its coat of arms. It is almost surrounded by the river Aar. The houses are mostly built of white free-stone, and, in the principal streets, have piazzas, or arches, under them, for the conveniency of walk∣ing dry in wet weather. Most of the streets are paved with flints and traversed by a canal lined with free-stone, which is brought from a con∣siderable distance, and is very useful in carry∣ing off the filth of the city, extinguishing fires, and other purposes. The city is large, standing almost in the middle of the canton, and containing several churches, of which one is called the Great Church, and the first minister thereof, the dean, who is the head of the city-clergy. From an inscrip∣tion near the great door of this church, it appears,
<PB N="383" REF="3870"/>
that the first stone of it was laid in 1421. Over the same door is a representation of the last judge∣ment, in which the sculptor hath placed the pope among the damned. In this city is also a college with eight professors, a large public library, and a museum; a stately granary, in which a great quan∣tity of corn is always kept; a guildhall; a well stored arsenal; and several hospitals. In the arse∣nal is a wooden statue of the famous Tell, which ropresents him as taking aim at the apple placed on the head of his son. There is also the sta∣tue of Berch told von Zahringen, the founder of the city; and two large horns of buffaloes or wild bulls, called in Latin Uri, such as are used in war by the canton of Uri instead of trumpets, and taken from it in the year 1712. Hard by also hang the grotesque dresses of those who blew them. The inhabitants of Uri, who boast their descent from the old Tau, bear a buffalo's head in their risci, coat of arms; and the person who blows the great horn in time of war, is called the bull of Uri. In the Dominican church, a hole in the wall is always shewn to strangers, by means of which, it having a communication with the cell of a monk in an adjoining monastery, the pious fraud of mak∣ing an image of the Virgin appear to speak, was once carried on, which for a while answered the purposes of the monks very well; but they were at last detected and punished. This city, though larger, is not so populous nor so well built as that of Zu∣rich. On the east side of it is a handsome stone bridge; and near the great church is a very fine platform some hundred feet in height, which makes a most delightful walk, being planted with limes, and commanding a charming prospect, particularly of the mountains of the Grisons, covered with snow in the midst of summer. In 1654 a student of divinity, being on horseback, and in liquor,
<PB N="384" REF="3880"/>
leaped over this terrace without receiving any other hurt than breaking a leg, and lived many years af∣ter, but the horse was killed. In the upper part of the city are always kept a number of bears in two inclosures, with fir-trees for them to clamber and play upon. Of the burghers of Berne, only those are qualified for the government and magistracy of of the city, who are the descendants of such as were made burghers before the year 1635. Other qualifications are also necessary, in particular they must not be under thirty years of age, and must be enrolled in one of the twelve companies. To obtain a country government, or to hold any con∣siderable employment, the candidate also must be married. The great council, in which the sove∣reignty of the canton is vested, consists, when full, of two hundred and twenty-nine, but is generally much short of that number, eighty or more often dying before their places are filled up. The lesser council senate, or, as it is called, the daily council, because it meets every day, Sundays and holydays excepted, consists of twenty-seven members, in∣cluding the two praetors, or advoyers, the four tri∣bunes of the people, the two treasurers, and the two heimlichers, or secrecy-men, so called, because to them all secrets relating to the state are disco∣vered. The members of the great and little coun∣cils mutually fill up the vacancies that hap∣pen in these two colleges. How the bailiffs are chosen we have already taken notice. Our limits will not permit us to enter into any fur∣ther detail with respect to the government, only it is to be observed in general, that all the officers of any note are chosen out of the great or little councils; and that all the bailiffs and caf∣tellans of the canton continue six years in office. The trade of the city is not very great, but was less before the French refugees settled therein; some, however, doubt whether it has been a gainer
<PB N="385" REF="3890"/>
by them, as by their introduction of French modes and luxury, they have helped to banish the antient Helvetic simplicity and frugality. The territory immediately under its jurisdiction is divided into four governments, with which the four venners, or standard-bearers, are invested. It declared for the Reformation in 1528, after a solemn disputa∣tion. Here the British envoy to the cantons re∣sides.</P>

<P>Unterseen, a small town on the river Aar, be∣tween the Thun and Brienz lake.</P>
<P>Wimmis, a large village or town in the Simmen vale, where the Saan cheese, so much esteemed, is made. The inhabitants of the vale live chiefly on cheese, potatoes, and barley cakes; and their ordi∣nary drink is milk or whey. There is a warm bath of great virtue in the valley, called Weiszen∣burgerbad.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="3900"/>
Ratzli, a high hill in the castellany of Upper Simmenthal, commanding a view, which, at first sight, is apt to excite terror, over an eismeer, or icy lake, and several gletschers, or hills, covered with ice and snow, all lying below it.</P>
<P>Frutigen, a village which gives name to a cas∣tellany, consisting of a long valley. Throughout all Switzerland, there is no where such plenty of sulphur veins, nor such rich ores, as in the neigh∣bourhood of Kandelstag in this valley.</P>
<P>Haszli, a village, giving name to a territory or valley of considerable extent, in which are fine woods of beech and pine, excellent roots, wild fowl of all kinds, chamois, and other mountain animals, together with mines, particularly of lead and iron, and fine chrystals. Over a high moun∣tain here called the Grimsel, or Grimslen-hill, lies a road, which is practicable only in summer, and is even then very difficult and dangerous, on account of the ice and snow: in some places there are bridges laid from one rock to another, in others, the road is hewn out of the solid rock, and in others guarded with walls. The inhabitants of this district, with great labour and expence, keep it in repair. On the top of the mountain is a lake, and at the foot of it, on the highway, stands a house, called an hospital, though properly speaking it is only an inn. The innkeeper, or hospitaller, as he is called, is appointed every five years by the land∣holders of the Haszli vale, and continues there as long as the road is practicable, accommodating travellers with victuals and drink. Such as are able pay for what they have; but the poorer sort are entertained gratis, and the expence is defrayed by an annual collection made throughout the can∣tons. Round the mountain runs an eisthal, or ice valley, called Grimselthal, in a part of which, named Zinkenberg, a crystal pit was discovered in
<PB N="387" REF="3910"/>
1719, wherein was found chrystal to the value of upwards of thirty thousand rix-dollars; many pieces dug out of it weighing from four to seven and eight hundred pounds, most of which were without a flaw, and perfectly transparent. The inhabitants of this district have a particular dialect of their own. They put themselves under the sovereignty of Bern in 1333, but with a reserve of their antient rights and usages.</P>
<P>Fraubrunnen, a village, in Latin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons beatae Vir∣ginis, on the high road between Bern and Solothurn. Near it, as we are told by travellers, is a stone pillar with an inscription, importing, that in the year 1375, a body of English were defeated there by the Berners. The real fact, it would seem, was this: one Coucy, a nobleman of Picardy, mar∣ried the daughter of Leopold, the Magnani∣mous, of Austria, and, by way of portion, ob∣tained a right to some imperial cities in Switzer∣land; but he died in 1349. It is probable there∣fore, that a son, or some other relation of his, marched some troops into Switzerland to assert his claim; and as a great part of France was then subject to the English, the army he brought with him was, no doubt, partly composed of that na∣tion.</P>
<P>Grindelwald, a village in the bailiwic of Inter∣lachen, or Interlappen, giving name to a vale, in which are several ice-mountains and lakes. Here, in particular, are a great many bluish ice-hills, formed by the masses of ice and snow that have fallen from the more lofty Gletschers, or ice-moun∣tains, that surround them, which, from the verdure and contrast of other mountains, are very striking to the spectator, and draw a great resort of strangers to see them.</P>

<P>Vevay, or Vivis, a pretty large flourishing town on the lake of Geneva, twelve miles from Lau∣sanne. Here is a college for the instruction of youth, the most considerable of any in the Pais de Vaud, next to that of Lausanne. In one of the churches is a monument of Edmund Ludlow, esquire, one of king Charles I's judges, who died here in the seventy-third year of his age. Over the door of the house in which he lived is this in∣scription:</P>
<P><HI>Omne solum forti patria, quia patris.</HI></P>
<P>Here is likewise the monument of one Broughton, who is supposed to be the same person who was
<PB N="389" REF="3930"/>
clerk to the pretended high court of justice. This town gives name to a bailiwic, in which is also La Tour de Pelie, and Villeneuve, small towns, the latter at the head of the lake; and Chillion, once a seat on the lake, but now an arsenal and gra∣nary.</P>
<P>Lausanne, the capital of the Pais de Vaud, and the second city of the whole canton, standing one long mile from the lake, twenty-six from Geneva, and forty from Bern. Before the Reformation it was a bishop's see: the bishop then retired to Fribourg in the Brisgau, where his successors have resided ever since, with the title of bishop of Lau∣sanne, which was once also a free imperial city, and still enjoys great privileges, being possessed of the criminal jurisdiction, and also of the civil, except in causes above the value of twelve hundred flo∣rins, which are carried before the council of Bern. Here is a college founded in 1537, for the in∣struction of youth intended for the ministry. The cognizance of criminal affairs belongs entirely to one quarter of the town, called St. Francis, and in that is one street, of which, if any of the inhabitants is guilty of a capital crime, the others have the sole power of condemning or acquitting him. The whole town consists of steep ascents and descents, and takes its name from its situa∣tion betwixt the brooks Laus and Anna. It gives name to a bailiwic, the bailiff of which re∣sides in the castle, which was formerly the bishop's palace, and has some jurisdiction in the town. In the college here, Theodore Beza translated the Psalms into French verse; and the first professor of law established in it, was the late learned Barbey∣rac, who died a professor in one of the Dutch uni∣versities. The great church, which was antiently the cathedral, is a large Gothic structure, said to have been two hundred years in building: there
<PB N="390" REF="3940"/>
are two hundred and seventy-two marble columns in it, some or which, we are told, are of one piece. In the wall is a fissure, once large enough for a man to creep through, which was occasioned by an earthquake in 1634, and, ten years after, was closed up by another. On the east side of the town is a very pleasant walk, with a charming prospect of the city, and the lake, which, though half a league off, seems to be hard by: the view is much the same from the terrace by the great church. In short, such is the beauty of this country, the charming contrast of hills and vallies, corn fields, meadows, vineyards, and woods, with the additional recommendation of a noble lake and mild government, that persons of all ranks and countries flock hither, and to the other towns in the Pais de Vaud. The bailiwic to which this town gives name, is the largest in the whole country, and contains several other small towns, as St. Saphorin, noted for its wine, Cu∣illi, Lustry, and Vilette, all on the lake; Corzi sus Vevay, or Corsier, situated in Rys-vale, which is celebrated for its wine, known by the name of Ryftwein.</P>
<P>Morsee, in French Morges, a small but pleasant town on the lake, a league and half south-west of Lausanne. It gives name to a bailiwic, in which is St. Prix, a walled market-town, having a fa∣mous mineral spring in its neighbourhood; Cos∣sonay, a small town, in a valley on the river Ve∣noge; L'Isle, a market town; Rolle, a town on the lake, giving name to a barony; and other small places.</P>
<P>Aubonne, a small town, at a little distance from Geneva, giving name to a bailiwic, and containing a castle, whence there is a most enchanting prospect of the lake and neighbouring country.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="3950"/>
Nyon, a small town on the lake, with a castle. It gives name to a bailiwic, and is supposed to be the Colonia Equestris of Julius Caesar. There are still some remains of Roman antiquities about it; in particular, at the distance of about five miles, are to be seen the ruins of Caesar's wall, which extended from mount Jura to the borders of the lake.</P>
<P>Coppet, a small town on the lake, with a beau∣tiful castle belonging to a burgher of St. Gall. It gives name to a barony famous for its red wine.</P>
<P>Yverdon, a pretty town, at the head of the lake of Neuschatel, where the Orbe falls into it, twenty miles from Lausanne. It gives name to a bailiwic, in which is Esclees, a mean little town, with St. Croix, and several other villages.</P>
<P>Milden, a small town on the Broye, which gives name to a bailiwic, containing La Serra, a small town; Lucens, a castle; and several villages.</P>
<P>Wifflisburg, in French Avenche, and antiently Aventicum, a small town, five miles south-west of Bern, near the lake of Murat. In Julius Caesar's time it was the capital of all Switzerland, and ma∣ny Roman coins, and other antiquities, are still found about it: here also are the remains of se∣veral Roman works. The town gives name to a bailiwic, in which is also Cudresin, a small town on the lake of Neufchatel; and Grandcourt, a small town, with a castle.</P>
<P>Petterlingen, in French Payerne, a pretty little town, two leagues from Avenche, on the river Broye, over which it has a stone bridge. Its reve∣nue and privileges are considerable, and it gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Romainmotier, in Latin Romani Monasterium, a small town on the river Noson, among high mountains. It gives name to a bailiwic, in which is the lac de Jou, or lake of Jour, about two
<PB N="392" REF="3960"/>
leagues in length, and half a league in breadth. The inhabitants of this bailiwic, and indeed of all the parts of Mount Jura dependent on the canton of Bern, go to church not only with their swords, but also with their muskets and screwed bayonets, which they keep, during divine service, either be∣tween their legs, or place in a corner of the church.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>In the district called the ARGAU, from its situation on both sides the Aar, are the four towns of Brugg or Bruck, Lenzburg, Arau, and Zof∣fingen, which submitted to this canton in 1415, but are independent of any bailiwic, and enjoy great privileges under the immediate sovereignty of Bern.</HEAD>
<P>Brugg or Bruck, in Latin Pons Arulae, is so called from its fine stone bridge, over the Aaar or Aren. Here are several councils, from which an appeal lies to the German council at Bern. It is a pretty large well built city, and has a hand∣some town-house, with a public library, college, and granary. In the neighbourhood of this town formerly stood Vindonissa, a town of Helvetia, de∣stroyed by Constantius; and the rich abbey of Ko∣nigsfelden. The celebrated old castle of Habsburg, the original family seat of the counts of that title, from whom descended the august house of Au∣stria, stands high, on the river Aar, about a league from Brugg, and was built in the eleventh century, by Werner, bishop of Strasburg.</P>
<P>Lenzburg is a neat little town, with a castle, seated on a mountain, in a pleasant fertile country, and giving name to a bailiwic of great extent; but the bailiff has little or no authority in the town.</P>
<P>Arau is not a very large but a very pleasant town, seated on the Aaar, from which it takes its name,
<PB N="393" REF="3970"/>
and on which it has a covered bridge. It stands thirty miles north-east of Bern, and is noted for being the place where the protestant towns and cantons hold their assemblies. Here also an end was put to the war that broke out, in 1712, between some of the protestant and popish cantons. The inhabitants are so jealous of their franchises, that if a burgher, condemned by his judges, ap∣peals to Bern, he loses his freedom. To the town also belong the high and low jurisdiction within its district.</P>
<P>Zoffingen is a small town, seated on the river Wigger, and under its own regency. Here is a public library, enriched with some curious ma∣nuscripts, and increasing every day. Nicholas Dut, who was advoyer of this town, and as such carried its colours at the battle of Sempach, in 1386, finding himself surrounded by the enemy, tore the colours in pieces, and crammed them into his mouth, where they were found after his death, and carried back to the town-house.</P>

<HEAD>LUCERN.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is the largest and most powerful of the popish cantons, its greatest length being about forty-eight miles, and its greatest breadth about thirty-two. It is bounded on the east by the can∣tons of Zug and Schweiz, and the free provinces, towards the north and west it terminates on the canton of Bern, and towards the south on the can∣ton of Underwalden. A part of the canton is mountainous, yet yields good pasture, both for sheep and cattle: the more level parts are fruit∣ful in corn, so that it has not only enough for itself, but also to spare to its neighbours, the lesser and more barren cantons. There are several lakes in it, great or small, abounding with fish, and also
<PB N="394" REF="3980"/>
rivers, of which the Rusz, the greater and lesser Emmat, and Goldbach are the chief; the two last are said to be aurifluous. Pilate's Hill, in this canton, is one of the highest in Switzerland, and has a lake on the top. Lucern acceded to the Hel∣vetic alliance in the year 1322: its government is aristocratical, and its chief revenue arises from the estates of the extinct nobility: it is said to be able to raise fifteen hundred men, and is noted for its inveteracy against protestantism. The places of most note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Lucern, from which it has its name, standing on a branch of the four forest-towns lake, called also the lake of Lucern, where the Rusz issues from it; twenty-two miles from Zurich, and twenty-four from Bern. It is a considerable thoroughfare to Italy, and contains an arsenal, a magnificent Jesuit's college and town house, several convents, with a ca∣thedral or collegiate church, in which is an organ so large that an ordinary man may creep into the greater pipes. A nuncio from the pope usually resides here. The town is supposed to have had its name from a lucerna, or lantern, set up here to direct passengers on the lake in the night. The government of the town and canton is lodged in a great and little council, chosen out of the burgh∣ers. The catholic cantons usually have their par∣ticular diet here. Both town and canton are in the diocese of Constance.</P>
<P>Willisau, a small town on the Wigger, with a mansion-house, or castle, for the bailiff, it being the capital of a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Sempach, a town on the lake, to which it gives name. The inhabitants are mostly fishermen, and independent of the bailiwic.</P>
<P>Baldeck, a seat and village, giving name to an adjacent lake in the bailiwic of Rotenburg.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="3990"/>
Munster, a large market-town, owing its name and origin to a Benedictine monastery. The prior of St. Michael here, though appointed by Lucern, is joint lord with it of the town and its precinct.</P>
<P>Ruszweil, a market-town, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Sursee, a small free-town, not far from the Sem∣pach lake, on the river Suren.</P>
<P>St. Urban, a rich Cistercian abbey, on the little river Rott, between Upper and Lower Tuntweil.</P>
<P>There are in all fifteen baliwics belonging entire∣ly to this canton, besides those that it holds in common with other cantons, and the lordships of Russeck and Heidec, in the free provinces.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>URI.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is bounded to the north by the canton of Schwitz; to the south by some of the Italian bailiwics; to the east by the Grisons, and the canton of Glaris; and on the west by the can∣tons of Bern and Underwald. Its length is about sixty miles, and its breadth upwards of twenty. It consists almost every where of high mountains and deep vallies. The mountain called St. Gotthards∣berg, is the highest in Switzerland, if not in Eu∣rope. A road lies over it to Italy, which ascends continually for eight hours, or twenty-four miles, and is practicable not only to horses, but carriages. The height of the mountain, the snow and ice, woods, naked rocks, precipices, cascades, green pastures, lakes, the noise of the river Rusz, and other torrents, heightened by the echoes among the hollows of the mountain, present altogether, both to the eyes and ears of a traveller, a very ro∣mantic, awful, and majestic scene. In a certain part of the mountain, near the highway, is a Ca∣puchin convent, in which two fathers constantly
<PB N="396" REF="4000"/>
attend, and, for a small consideration, accommo∣date travellers with whatever is wanted. Many thousand head of cattle graze on this, and the other mountains here, in summer; and great quan∣tities of cheese are made on them. The vales be∣tween these mountains are excceding hot in sum∣mer, and yield the most luxuriant crops of grass: most beautiful chrystals also are often found among them. The inhabitants are a hardy, vigorous, and brave people, but noted for their blind zeal and bigotry. Most part of the income of this state arises from the imposts on goods carried betwixt Italy and Germany, and the annual pensions they receive from the kings of France and Spain. They have no wine, little corn, and few or no manu∣factures; but plenty of wood, fish, black cattle, butter, and cheese, with which they purchase what necessaries they want. They are reckoned about twenty thousand in number, of which those of better fashion live by the flocks and herds they keep in their grounds; and the meaner sort by tending these herds, or hawking and peddling Ger∣man and Italian wares. The government here is democratical, as in all the other petty cantons, where they have hardly any towns, but live dis∣persed in villages. The landes gemeine, or gene∣ral assembly of the canton, is held annually on the first Sunday of May, and in that every male, above sixteen, has a vote. The landrathe or council ordi∣narily consists of six persons, deputed from each of the communities into which the conton is di∣vided, who are nominated from among the prin∣cipal officers and magistrates. The president of the council is called the Landamman. Some of their magistates are generally innkeepers. In ec∣clesiastical matters, they are subject to the bishops of Constance, Coire, or Como. The only places in the canton, deserving the name of towns, are,</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="4010"/>
Altorf, i. e. the Old Village, standing twenty-three miles south-east of Lucern, not far from the Reusz, and the Vier Waldstadtersee, or lake of the four forest towns. It is well built, being the seat of the government, and the place where most of the gentry reside; containing an arsenal, a gra∣nary, a handsome town-house, with a house for cutting and polishing chrystal, three churches, and two convents.</P>
<P>Geornico, in German, Irnis, a pretty large market town, standing on both sides the Tessin.</P>
<P>The most remarkable vallies are,</P>
<P>Meyden, a very wild vale, containing a chapel, and some scattered habitations.</P>
<P>Livinirthal, in Latin, Vallis Lepontina, lying on the other side of St. Gotthardt's mountain, to∣wards Italy, with the Tesin running through it. Galeazzo Maria, duke of Milan, ceded this valley to the canton in 1446. Its inhabitants are Italians, dependent in spirituals on the bishop of Camo, and governed by a bailiff sent from Uri.</P>
<P>Urserenthal, or Urseren valley, which is about three leagues in length, and one in breadth, and yields good pasturage, but wants wood; so that the inhabitants have no other fuel, but wild rose∣trees, and a kind of heath or broom. These inha∣bitants are a free people, and rather allies, than subjects of the canton of Uri. In ecclesiastical mat∣ters, they are subject to the bishop of Coire. The valley begins a little beyond a bridge over the Reusz, on St. Gotthardt's mountain, called the Devil's-bridge, being of such a height, with its founda∣tions laid on rocks, almost as low as the bed of the river, which is here very impetuous, that every one who sees it, is astonished how it was erected.</P>

<PB N="398" REF="4020"/>
<HEAD>SCHWEIZ.</HEAD>
<P>This canton to the south borders on Uri; to the north on the Zurich see; to the east on Glaris; and to the west on Lucern, Zug, and Zurich. It is above thirty miles in length, and twenty in breadth. With respect to its soil, government, and religion, they are much the same as those of Uri: its inhabitants too, like those of that canton, are hardy, bold, and vigorous: their land, for the most part, is pasture ground, yielding little corn, and no wine; but they have plenty of fish from their lakes and rivers, with black cattle, game, butter, and cheese. In spirituals they are subject to the bishop of Constance. Though this is one of the petty cantons, and only the second in rank among these, yet it has the honour of giving name to the whole confederacy. The inhabitants are descended from the Cimbrians, who, after being defeated by Marius, the Roman general, fled to these mountains. In 1308 they threw off the Austrian yoke, and united with Uri and Underwald, for the defence of their common rights; and by these three, Leopold, duke of Au∣stria, was totally defeated at Morgart, in this can∣ton. The principal places in it, or under its sove∣reignty, are,</P>
<P>Schweiz, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal, and the seat of the regency. It stands ten miles from Lucern, in a pleasant valley between hills, that are generally covered with snow, and contains, besides a parish church, three convents, a town house, a mint, an hospital, an arsenal, and several handsome private houses.</P>
<P>Brunnen, a village on the lake of the four can∣tons, commonly called the lake of Lucern, where in 1315, the cantons of Uri, Schweiz, and Under∣wald, entered into a perpetual alliance, and there∣by
<PB N="399" REF="4030"/>
laid the foundation of the Helvetic confede∣racy.</P>
<P>Unterart, a free borough on the Zug-lake, which gives name to one of the six parts or districts, into which the canton is divided.</P>
<P>Lachen, a small place, with a harbour, on the lake of Zurich, and in the district of March or Mark. That district, which is fruitful, and lies along the lake, belonged to the house of Austria, till 1405, when being reduced by the people of Appenzel, it was transferred by them to this can∣ton, as an acknowledgment for their assistance. The inhabitants have great privileges.</P>
<P>Einsidlen, a small town, near the river Meuse, ten miles north-east from Schweiz. Here is a rich Benedictine abbey, the abbot of which has the title of prince, and is lord of the town and its territory, under the sovereignty, or rather the protection of the canton. Paracelsus, the famous physician, was born here, and died at Saltzburg in 1540. It was owing to the prodigious resort of pilgrims to the abbey, to pay their vows or devotions to the Virgin, that the neighbouring country, which was formerly a gloomy forest, is now full of villages and farm houses. Over the door of the chapel of the Virgin is inscribed, in large characters, these words, <HI>Hic est plena remissio peccatorium a culpa &amp; a poena;</HI> i. e. Here is full remission both of the guilt and punishment of sinners. The treasure of the abbey is of immense value: in particular, here is a large pyx, which, besides one hundred and sixty ounces of gold, is adorned with one hundred and seventy-four large pearls, three hundred and three diamonds, thirty-eight sapphires, one hundred and fifty-four emeralds, eight hundred and sixty rubies, forty-four garnets, twenty-six hyacinths, and nineteen amethysts. The abbey was rebuilt in 1704, and is a large splendid edifice, contain∣ing
<PB N="400" REF="4040"/>
magnificent apartments for the abbot, with a library, and convenient rooms for the recluses, and the entertainment of strangers. The church of our Lady is embellished with masterly paintings, rich guildings, and most delicate stucco-work. In the district belonging to the abbey is also a nun∣nery, containing a treasure of great value, and de∣pendent on the abbey, which is also possessed of the Aufnau, a small delightful island in the Zurichsee, with lands, jurisdictions, and preroga∣tives, in many other places.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>UNDERWALD.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is divided by a forest into two parts, denominated Ober and Underwald, i. e. above and below the forest; but the canton bears only the name of the latter. Northward and west∣ward it is bounded by the canton and part of the lake of Lucern; southward by the cantons of Uri and Bern; eastward by that of Uri; being eighteen miles from north to south, and fifteen from east to west. Here is little corn or wine, but fine fruits, pastures, woods, and cattle, with lakes, mi∣neral springs, and quarries of marble. One of its vallies is called the Melchthal, or Milk-Vale. The two parts mentioned above make two com∣munities, which have each their respective chief, diet, council, seal, banner, and officers; but as they both constitute only one canton, they have also a common-council. Both are of the popish religion, and in the diocese of Constance: as the Oberwald has two thirds of the public re∣venue, it pays also two-thirds of the public ex∣pences. Though both send a representative to the general diet of the cantons, yet they have but one voice: this canton shook off the Austrian yoke at the same time as the two last described. The capital of the vale above the forest is Sarnen, on
<PB N="401" REF="4050"/>
the river Aar, and of that below Stanz. The diet of the last is held annually, in a meadow; and every male in it above twenty has a vote, not only in the diet, but also in the criminal courts.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ZUG.</HEAD>
<P>This canton, in Latin Pagus Jugiensis, is bound∣ed on the east and north by that of Zurich, on the south by Schweiz and Lucern, and on the west by the canton of Lucern and the Freye-Amt, or Free Provinces. It is not above twelve miles either way, but much more populous and fruitful than any of the three former, yielding wine, wheat, chesnuts, and other fruits, in its vales, and ex∣cellent pasture on its mountains. The inhabitants of this canton are as staunch Roman catholics as those of the four last mentioned. It lies in the dio∣cese of Constance, and its government, like that of the three last, is democratical. There are two lakes in it, abounding in fish, particularly large carps, pikes, and a species of trouts, called rotels; as well as several woods, full of game. The only places in the canton worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Zug, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It stands on the east side of a lake of the same name, about seven miles long, and is a strong neat town, containing a priory, and two convents.</P>
<P>Walterschwyl, in Latin Villa Gualteriana, a seat at the foot of Mount Barbourg, having a noted hot bath near it.</P>
<P>Frauenthal, in Latin Vallis beatae Mariae, or Val∣lis Dominarum, a rich Cistercian abbey on the river Loretz, under the protection of Zug.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="402" REF="4060"/>
<HEAD>GLARIS, or GLARUS.</HEAD>
<P>This canton, in Latin Pagus Glarenensis, is bounded on the east by the county of Sargans and the Grisons; on the west by the canton of Schwitz and Uri, on the south by the Grisons and Uri, and on the north by the bailiwic of Gaster and the March. It is surrounded on all sides, except to∣wards the north, with lofty mountains, one of which, called Todiberg, is almost impassable. The principal valley extends from north to south, above twenty miles, and is said to be very subject to earth∣quakes. The other vales yield good pasturage, but little corn or pulse. Vast numbers of horses, black cattle, goats, and sheep, graze both on the mountains and in the vallies, and great quantities of butter and cheese are made in both. The mountains yield also wood, slate, chrystal, mineral waters, and baths, and the rivers and lakes abound with fish. The government, like that of the pre∣ceding petty cantons, is democratical; but the greater part of the inhabitants are protestants. Their principal business is grazing. About some of the lakes, the winds are remarkably regular in their rising, falling, and shifting; for in the morning an easterly breeze sets in, and continues until ten, when a calm ensues until noon, then a westerly breeze springs up until sun-set, when, if the weather is fair, it shifts to the east. Dr. Bur∣net tells us, that in all suits at law here, betwixt those of different religions, two-thirds of the judges must be of the religion of the defendant. Matri∣monial causes, among the protestants or Calvinists, are determined by the consistory. Besides the ge∣neral diet of both religions, held annually in a field without the town of Glaris, there are particular diets of each religion, held also annually; that of
<PB N="403" REF="4070"/>
the Calvinists at Schwanden, and that of the papists in a field between Netstall, and Naffels. Here, as in the other democratical cantons, besides the diets called landesgemeine, there is a landrathe, i. e. a council or regency, with several courts of justice, for civil, criminal, and ecclesiastical affairs. The principal officers are the amman, stadtholder, and banneret. The militia consist of seven companies. The places of most note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Glaris, which gives name to it, is a large hand∣some town on the river Linth, having a week∣ly market, and several annual fairs.</P>
<P>Elm, a village, so hemmed in with high moun∣tains that the inhabitants, for several weeks in the year, never see the sun.</P>
<P>Naffels, a pretty little town upon the Linth, near which, in the year 1308, three hundred and fifty Switzers defeated eight thousand (some say fifteen thousand) Austrians.</P>
<P>Schwanden, a country town, giving name to a parish entirely protestant, and the largest in the canton, next to that of Glaris.</P>
<P>Werdenburg, a small town, giving name to a county on the Rhine, belonging to this canton. The inhabitants of the county are all protestants, and their bailiff is also always such. There is a chain of hills here called the Freyberg, or Free Mountain, because none but twelve sworn hunters are allowed to hunt upon it, and that only in sum∣mer, and for a marriage-feast, when they must ne∣ver kill more than a couple of Chamois goats.</P>
<P>The above described eight cantons are called the old ones, because they were the only members of the Helvetic body for an hundred and thirty years. The next in rank to these is,</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="404" REF="4080"/>
<HEAD>BASIL.</HEAD>
<P>This canton was no part of the antient Switzer∣land, or Helvetia, but was even then an ally, as it is now a member of the laudable Helvetic body. It is bounded to the south by the canton of Solo∣thurn, to the north by a part of the margravate of Baden-Dourlach and the territory of Rheinfelden, to the east by the Frickthal, and to the west by Solothurn, the diocese of Basil, and the Sundgau, being upwards of twenty miles in length, and about eighteen in breadth. It is entirely pro∣testant, and contains twenty-seven parishes, and seven bailiwics. The lower parts of it are fruit∣ful in pasture, corn, and wine, but the mountains extremely barren. There are many medicinal springs and baths in it, and the air is wholesome and temperate. Both men and women, for the most part, wear the French dress; but the lan∣guage commonly spoken is High-Dutch, though the French also is much used. This canton join∣ed the confederacy in the year 1501. Its govern∣ment, like that of Bern, Zurich, and Lucern, is aristocratical; and its revenues arise chiefly from secularized abbeys, and imposts on goods carried through the country, to and from France, Italy, and Germany. Besides the military establishment of the city of Basil, there are two provincial regi∣ments, consisting each of ten companies, and a troop of dragoons. The places of most note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Basil, which gives name to it, and is its capital. This is the largest city in all Switzerland, having two hundred and twenty streets, and six market-places or squares. Its environs are exceeding beautiful, consisting of a fine level tract of fields and meadows. The city is divided into two parts
<PB N="405" REF="4090"/>
by the Rhine, over which there is a handsome bridge. It is thought to have risen on the ruins of the old Augusta Rauracorum. For its name of Basilia, it is indebted to Julian the Apostate, who would have it so called, in honour of his mother Basilina. It is fortified with walls, moats, towers, and bastions, and contains several churches, besides the cathedral, which is an old Gothic structure; a commandery of the order of St. John, and another of the Teutonic order; a public granary, and arse∣nal; a stately town-house, in which is an exquisite piece of the sufferings of Christ, by Holbein, and a statue of Munatius Plancus, a Roman general, who, about fifty years before Christ, built the antient city of Augusta Rauracorum; an university, which was founded in 1459, and has a curious physic∣garden, library, and museum; a gymnasium; a stately palace, belonging to the margrave of Baden-Dourlach; besides a chamber of curiosities, se∣veral hospitals. &amp;c. In the arsenal is shewn the ar∣mour in which Charles the Bold lost his life, with the furniture of his horse, and the kettle-drums and trumpets of his army. On the stair-case of the council-house, is a picture of the last Judgment, in which, though drawn before the Reformation, popes, cardinals, monks, and priests, are represent∣ed in the torments of hell. Over-against the French church, on a long covered wall, is painted the dance of death; where the king of Terrors is represented as mixing with all ranks and ages, and complimenting them, in German verses, on their arrival at the grave. St. Peter's square, planted with elm and lime-trees, makes a pleasant walk; but a spot regularly planted with trees, close by the river, and near the minster, makes still a finer, as commanding a most beautiful and extensive pro∣spect. The celebrated Erasmus died here, in 1536, in the seventieth year of his age, and was buried in
<PB N="406" REF="4100"/>
the great church. He left his library and cabinet of rarities to one Amberbach, a learned lawyer of this city, of whose heirs they were purchased by the university. Besides this cabinet, there are several other curious private ones. The clocks of this city go an hour faster than elsewhere, except at Constance, a circumstance, which some ascribe to the famous councils held there, when it was thought the best expedient to bring the fathers earlier to the assem∣bly, for the quicker dispatch of business; but others say, that, in Basil, it was owing to a conspiracy being defeated by that means. Trade still flourishes here, especially in silk, ribbons, and wines; and the police is under excellent regulations. Most of the offices are bestowed, by lot, among well qualified persons. No person, without the city, must wear lace of gold or silver. All young women are pro∣hibited from wearing silks; and the nearest rela∣tions only are to be invited to a marriage-feast. For the government of the city there are several councils or colleges, and officers. Of the last the two burgomasters, and two wardens of trades, are the chief. The great council is composed of the representatives of the several companies of the greater and lesser city. Basil was the see of a bishop till the Reformation; but though there is one that still bears the title, he has now no juris∣diction here, and lives at Porentru, near the Upper Alsace. The two Buxtorffs, father and son, and the famous painter, Holbein, were natives of this place. The council held here, in 1431, sat in the vestry of the cathedral.</P>

<HEAD>FRIBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is near forty miles in length, and above twenty in breadth. It is encompassed on all sides by the canton of Bern, a few places excepted, which lie on the lake of Neufchatel, and the bailiwics of Murten and Schwarzenburg. It is partly mountainous, and partly champaign, and, besides some wine, yields plenty of pasturage, grain, fruit, cattle, and cheese. France supplies it with salt, and the Pais de Vaud with wine. It is divided into three inner bailiwics, and sixteen outer, besides the territory of the city. A medley of French and German is spoken in some places,
<PB N="408" REF="4120"/>
but in others German only. The canton is entirely popish, and contains an hundred and four parishes, under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Lausanne, who resides at Freyburg. It became a member of the Helvetic body in 1481. The government is aristocratical, and its militia consists of eleven re∣giments, besides the burghers of Freyburg. The places of most note are,</P>
<P>Freyburg, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital. It is called Freyburg in Uchtlande, to di∣stinguish it from Freyburg in the Brisgaw, stands among rocks, in a valley, on the river Saone, six leagues south-west from Bern. Here are seve∣ral churches, convents, and hospitals, with a col∣lege of Jesuits, a mint, a granary, an arsenal, a commandery of St. John, and a council-house, which stands on a rock, and commands a grand prospect. The government is much the same as that of Bern; except that here it is confined to se∣venty families of patricians, exclusive of all others. The town is tolerably fortified. May the second, and the twenty-second of June, are observed here as great festivals, for two signal victories gained on these days over Charles the Bold. It is said, if a debtor in this town does not pay at the time ap∣pointed, the creditor sends his servants and horses to a public inn, where the debtor is obliged to maintain them, till he pays the debt. At the di∣stance of a league from Freyburg, in a wilderness of woods and rocks, is a remarkable hermitage, consisting of a church and steeple, with an oratory, a hall, dining-room, kitchen, several chambers, and stairs, a cellar, well, and other conveniences, all hewn out of a rock, not excepting the chimney and steeple, notwithstanding the latter is fifty-four feet high. A part of the rock was also cut into a flat for a garden, covered with earth, and planted with fruit and dwarf-trees of all sorts, and
<PB N="409" REF="4130"/>
pot-herbs. Besides all this, the water of a cry∣stal spring was conveyed, by several channels, into small reservoirs, for watering the garden, and other purposes. A work like this cannot fail of filling the mind of every spectator with astonish∣ment; but that must be greatly increased, when it is known, that it was wholly performed by only one man and a boy, in the space of twenty-five years. The ingenious architect was unhappily drowned, in the year 1708, in the river Sane, as he was conveying back some young people, that had attended the consecration of his little church, in a small boat, by the help of which he used, every week, to bring provisions, and other necessaries, from the city. The place of the deceased hermit is said to be now supplied by a priest, who subsists by the charities of strangers that come to see the hermitage, whom he generally regales with bread, wine, and a nosegay.</P>
<P>There are several other small towns in the can∣tons, but they contain nothing remarkable.</P>

<HEAD>SOLOTHURN.</HEAD>
<P>This canton, called by the French Soleurre, is bounded on the east and south by that of Bern, and on the north and west by the bishopric or canton of Basil; extending on both sides the river Aar, about twelve miles from north to south, and ten where broadest. This canton, though part of it consists of the mountain of Jura, is tolerably fertile, yielding corn, wine, fine woods, fruits, and pa∣stures. The religion professed in it is the Roman catholic, except in one bailiwic; and the govern∣ment is aristocratical. It became a member of the Helvetic body in 1481, and is said to be able to raise ten thousand men. In spirituals it is subject partly to the bishop of Lausanne, and partly to
<PB N="410" REF="4140"/>
those of Basil and Constance. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Solothurn, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, standing on the river Aar, seventeen miles north of Bern, and thirty-one south of Basil. It was a place of strength in the time of the Romans, and several of their medals, inscriptions, and other antiquities have been found here. It is situated in a pleasant, fertile country, and well fortified. In the collegiate church dedicated to St. Ursina, are several fine tombs and monuments; but some of the images are very gross, particularly one represent∣ing God the father as an old man, with a black beard, having our Saviour on his knees, and a pi∣geon over his head. The church and college of the Jesuits are reckoned the finest in all Switzerland, and are said to have cost above four hundred thou∣sand livres. Here also is a well furnished arsenal, and two convents, one which, namely, that of the Cordeliers, is the residence of the French envoy to the cantons. The government is much the same as that of Bern and Friburg, for here is a greater and lesser council, with other subordinate colleges, courts, and offices, two advoyers, a banneret, and treasurer. The language spoken here is the French. Eleven bailiwics are subject to this town, besides those that it possesses in common with other cantons.</P>
<P>Balstal, a considerable town in the bailiwic of Falkenstein.</P>
<P>There are several other little towns in the canton, as Clus, or Closen, Olten, Schonenwert.</P>
<P>Dr. Burnet says, that the Benedictine abbey of the pilgrimages of the Virgin Mary at Stein, in this canton, has a revenue of one hundred thousand livres; and that the people kneel down in the streets, long before they come near the doors of a church, where mass is celebrating.</P>

<HEAD>SCHAFFHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This is the most northern of all the cantons of Switzerland, and lies entirely on the German side of the Rhine. It is bounded on the south by the canton of Zurich, from which it is separated by the Rhine; on the west by the Black Forest; and on the north and east by Swabia: its greatest length being about twenty miles, and its breadth twelve. It is abundantly fertile, yielding corn, fruit, pa∣sture, plenty of fish, mineral springs, and good red wine. It was admitted a member of the Hel∣vetic body in 1501. The inhabitants are Calvin∣ists, and the government aristocratical. As for towns, the only one in it worth describing is,</P>
<P>Schaffhausen, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It is pleasantly situated in a plain on the Rhine, and is very handsome, the streets being broad, and the houses magnificent. Here are several churches (of which that of St. John is said to be the largest in all Switzerland, and that of All-Saints esteemed a very fine structure) an arsenal, an academy, of which the city pastors are professors, a noble cabinet of rarities, collected by the learned Charles Patin, who was a professor at Padua, with a fortress, which stands on the high∣est ground in the town, called the Emmersberg, and consequently commands it. The city carries on a good trade by the Rhine, over which it has a hand∣some stone-bridge. As its name, in German, signi∣fies a sheepfold, so it has a sheep for its coat of arms, and upon its coin. The fountains here, and in other parts of Switzerland, have generally pillars in the midst of their basons, with statues on them of William Tell, and the other deliverers of their country. Here also, as in the other aristocratical cantons, is a greater and lesser council, which are
<PB N="412" REF="4160"/>
chosen out of the twelve companies of burghers, and from which all the town-offices are filled up. In the suburbs is a spring of water in a cellar, so plentiful, that it supplies above one hundred pipes, and, in the neighbourhood, is a fine free-stone quarry. The town was originally called Scaph∣hausen, i. e. the barge or boat-house, from a ferry that was here formerly over the river.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned the lofty cataract in the Rhine, about a quarter of a league from this city, and called the cataract of Laufen.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>APPENZEL.</HEAD>
<P>This is the last, and one of the least of the thir∣teen cantons. It consists only of three or four val∣lies, having the town and abbey of St. Gall on the north; the county of Toggenburg on the west; the lordship of Sax, in the canton of Zurich, and that of Gambs, in the canton of Schweiz, on the south; and the Rheinthal, or Rhine valley, on the east. Its greatest length is about thirty miles, and its breadth about twenty. It yields good pa∣sturage, and consequently is not destitute of cattle, milk, butter, or cheese. Considerable quantities also of wheat, rye, barley, oats, beans, peas, flax, and wine, are produced in it; besides a great deal of fruit, wood, and turf, with mineral waters, and warm baths. There are many mountains in the canton, the highest of which is that called the Hohesantis, or the Hohe-Meszmer, which com∣mands a prospect of a prodigious extent. There are also several lakes and rivers. The inhabitants, who are partly protestants, and partly Roman ca∣tholics, subsist chiefly by their manufactures of linen, crape, fustian, and thread, or by bleaching, and the sale of their cattle, butter, cheese, horses, wood, and coal. Of the twenty-three parishes in
<PB N="413" REF="4170"/>
the canton, four are popish and nineteen protestant. Before the Reformation, the inhabitants were subject to the abbot of St. Gall, but they then shook off his yoke, and united themselves with the other can∣tons; after that, however, there were violent ani∣mosities between the papists and protestants, the former continually persecuting the latter, till at last, in 1587, by the mediation of the other cantons, the two parties came to an accommodation, by which certain districts were assigned to each party: whereas before they lived promiscuously together, and though these two divisions now constitute but one canton, yet each forms a distinct community or free state, sending its particular representatives to the diets of the confederacy, and having its se∣parate councils and officers. In spirituals the pa∣pists are subject to the bishop of Constance, but the protestants to their own consistory. The mi∣litia of the former does not exceed three thousand, whereas those of the latter amount to ten thousand. The places of most note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Appenzel, in Latin Abbatis Cella, i. e. the Ab∣bot's Cell, which gives name to the canton, and is its capital. It stands on the bank of the river Sit∣ter, twelve miles south of St. Gall, and thirty-one east of Zurich, being a considerable town, pleasantly situated in a delightful valley, in the popish di∣strict.</P>
<P>Herrisau, a large handsome borough, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Trogen, a large village or country-town, noted for its annual linen fair, and its warm bath, which is impregnated with sulphur, alum, and copper.</P>

<HEAD>The Bailiwic of the THURGAU.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic, of which the eight old cantons are sovereigns, is bounded to the south by the ter∣ritories of the prince and abbot of St. Gall; to the north by Swabia and the lake of Constance, by which it is also bounded to the east; and to the west by the cantons of Zurich and Schaff hausen. It is a very large, populous bailiwic, and takes its name from the river Thur, which traverses it. Though somewhat mountainous towards the south, it is, in general, a fruitful country, yielding grain and wine, with good pasture, and fruits of all kinds. About a third of its inhabitants are papists under the bishop of Constance, and the rest Calvi∣nists. The Switzers took it from Sigismund, arch∣duke of Austria, in the year 1460. The eight old cantons, viz. Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Uri, Schweiz, Underwald, Zug, and Glaris, who are sovereigns of it, alternately appoint a bailiff every two years: but a great part of it is immediately subject to certain lords, spiritual or temporal, par∣ticularly the bishop and chapter of Constance, and the abbot of St. Gall. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Frauenfeld, the capital, in Latin Gynopedium, that is, the Women's Field, which stands on the river Murk, eleven miles west of Constance, the greatest part of the inhabitants being Calvinists. The bailiff of the Thurgau resides here in a castle, on a rock, at one end of the town; and here the deputies of the eight cantons meet to audit the an∣nual accounts of their common bailiwics. Of the town-councils, two thirds are Calvinists, and one Papists. The provincial court also, which is com∣posed of four judges, nominated by the bailiff, from among the principal burghers, and determines ap∣peals
<PB N="415" REF="4190"/>
from the inferior courts, is held here. The magistrates are possessed of the high and low juris∣diction both in the town and its district.</P>
<P>Arbon, or Arben, a small town on the lake of Constance, supposed to be the Arbor Felix of An∣toninus. Most of the inhabitants are protestants; but the town-council is composed of an equal num∣ber of papists and protestants. The town has great privileges, yet is in part subject to the bishop of Constance; the civil and criminal jurisdiction in all its branches belong solely to the town; but the bishop has a bailiff in it, with certain rights and prerogatives. St. Gall died here in the old castle, anno 640. In time of war the cantons have a right to place a garrison in the town.</P>
<P>Bischoffzell, in Latin Episcopi Cella, standing at the conflux of the Sitter and Thur. The inha∣bitants are mostly Calvinists, but the town de∣pends, like the former, partly on the bishop of Constance, for the bishop's bailiff receives two∣thirds of the fines; but his authority, in other re∣spects, is very limited. Here is an abbey dedi∣cated to St. Pelagius, and founded by a bishop of Constance.</P>
<P>Dissenhosen, a considerable town on the Rhine, over which it has a bridge. It enjoys great privi∣leges; for the bailiffs have no authority in it, or its precinct; but appeals, in civil causes, lie from it to the cantons, or their deputies. The magistracy is composed partly of papists, and partly of protes∣tants. Several districts in the Thurgau, with the lower jurisdiction, belong to convents, some of which are within, and some without the bailiwic. In time of war, this and the other common bailiwics are obliged to send their militia to serve under the banners of the cantons to which they belong, and to maintain them at their own charge.</P>

<HEAD>The Bailiwic of the RHEINTHAL.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic has its name from its situation along the Rhine, by which it is bounded to the east. To the south it has the barony of Sax, be∣longing to the canton of Zurich; to the north the lake of Constance; and to the west the canton of Appenzel. It is about twenty miles long, and five where broadest, and is fruitful both in corn and wine, especially the latter. There is a chrystal pit in it, in which a vast deal of yellow, brown, and white transparent chrystal is found. Most of the inhabitants are protestants, and their ministers are always taken from the academy at Zurich. The sovereignty of it belong to nine cantons, viz. Bern, Zurich, Lucern, Schweiz, Glaris, Uri, Underwald, Zug, and Appenzel, who alternately appoint a bailiff every two years; but the abbot of St. Gall has not only a share of the jurisdiction, but a great revenue from it. It is divided into five communities, which have each two chiefs or am∣mans, of whom the cantons nominate one and the abbot the other. The places in it worth mention∣ing are,</P>
<P>Rhenick, a small town on the Rhine, but the capital of the bailiwic, and the residence of the bailiff.</P>
<P>Altsletten, a small town, belonging to the abbot of St. Gall, who has a bailiff, and other officers in it. An appeal also lies from its courts to the ab∣bot's council; but of the fines only one third be∣longs to him; of the other two-thirds, one goes to the town, and the other to the cantons. Both reli∣gions are tolerated here.</P>

<HEAD>The Bailiwic of SARGANS.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic has the Rhine on the east, separat∣ing it from the Grisons; the canton of Glaris and the county of Gaster on the west; and Toggen∣burg, with the lordship of Werdenburg, on the north. It is about eight leagues in length, and five or six in breadth. Its mountains feed great numbers of cattle, and its vallies produce corn and fruit. The inhabitants are partly papists and partly protestants. The latter have their ministers from the academy at Zurich, and the former are under the bishop of Coire. The bailiwic belongs to the eight old cantons, who send a bailiff to it in their turns, and is divided into the Upper and Lower Sargans, in which the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Sargans, situate near the Rhine. Though small, it is the capital of the bailiwic, and the resi∣dence of the bailiff.</P>
<P>Ragatz, a large borough on the river Jammin, not far from the Rhine.</P>
<P>Pfeffers, a rich Benedictine abbey, whose abbot is a prince of the empire. About a mile and a half from the convent is a famous hot-bath be∣longing to the abbey, the water of which is hot in the second degree, and good for many distem∣pers, being impregnated with spirit of sulphur, nitre, vitriol, and divers metals, particularly gold.</P>
<P>Wallenstadt, which, tho' a small town, situate not far from the lake to which it gives name, is a great thoroughfare for goods and travellers, to and from Italy. The lake is about five leagues in length, and half a league broad.</P>
<P>Flumbs, a small town on the river Seetz, where is a smelting-house, in which steel is made by the
<PB N="418" REF="4220"/>
fusion and mixture of three species of ore, black, red, and ash-coloured, dug out of the lofty moun∣tain of Gunz, in the neighbourhood. Of these two only serve to make iron.</P>

<HEAD>The Bailiwic of GASTER.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic is bounded to the south by the Wal∣lenstadt lake, and the cantons of Glaris and Schweiz; to the north by the territory of Toggenburg; to the west by the county of Sargans; and to the east by the bailiwic of Utznach. Though moun∣tainous, it is not unfruitful. As to religion, it is entirely popish, under the bishops of Coire and Constance, and belongs to the cantons of Schweiz and Glaris; but the inhabitants enjoy many privi∣leges, which every new bailiff swears to maintain. When it comes to the turn of Glaris to nominate the bailiff, it is only by and from among the pa∣pists that he is chosen. This district has a diet held every two years, and council, with two courts of justice, one for civil, and another for cri∣minal causes, in all which the bailiff presides. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Schanis and Wisen. In the former there is an abbey for ladies, the abbess of which is reckoned a princess of the empire, and is obliged to lead a sin∣gle life, though her nuns, if they chuse it, may marry.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Bailiwic of UTZNACH.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic is environed by Gaster, Toggen∣burg, the cantons of Zurich and Schwiez, and the territory of the town of Rapperschwiel. It was purchased, in 1469, by the cantons of Schwiez and Glaris, by whom a bailiff is appointed alternately, every two years; but when it is the turn of Glaris,
<PB N="419" REF="4230"/>
he is nominated by the papists alone, the inhabi∣tants being mostly of that persuasion. It takes its name from its capital, a small town.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Bailiwic of GAMBS.</HEAD>
<P>This is a small bailiwic, surrounded by the counties of Werdenburg and Toggenburg, and the lordship of Sax. It is subject to the same can∣tons as the two former, and enjoys much the same privileges. One bailiff also serves for it and Gaster.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>The Town of RAPPERSCHWEIL, with its District.</HEAD>
<P>This town lies thirteen miles south-west from Zurich, on the lake, towards Chur. It was an∣tiently called Ruprechtsweil, in Latin Ruperti Villa, i. e. Rupert's Village, from its founder St. Ru∣pert, duke of Swabia. It is a pretty town, and tole∣rably well fortified, having also a strong castle. The inhabitants, who are Roman catholics, still retain their antient privileges, under the sovereign∣ty of Zurich and Bern. Glaris also has some rights and prerogatives in it. The wooden bridge, ex∣tending from hence to a point of land in the lake, is said to be near two miles in length, yet, which is very surprising, has no rails.</P>

<HEAD>The County and Bailiwic of BADEN.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies in the Argau, being almost in∣closed by the Aar on the west, the Rhine on the north, the Reusz on the south, and the canton of Zurich on the east. The county, in general, a∣bounds with fruit and grain, and in some places yields wine and iron. Most of the inhabitants are papists. By the treaty of peace, at the conclusion of the war, that broke out in 1712, between the
<PB N="420" REF="4240"/>
protestant and popish cantons, this county, which is as big as some of the little cantons, and before the war was the property of the eight old cantons, was yielded to the protestant cantons of Zurich and Bern; that of Glaris however, which had taken no part in the war, still retaining, with the consent of both parties, its former rights. It is well watered by three navigable rivers, the Limmat, the Reusz, and the Aar, which abound with fish. The can∣tons of Bern and Zurich appoint a bailiff succes∣sively, each for seven years, and then Glaris, for two. Places of any note in the county are,</P>
<P>Baden, which gives name to it, and is its capital, standing on the Limmat, and being otherwise called Upper-Baden, to distinguish it from the town of the same name in Swabia. In Latin it is called Castellum or Vicus Thermarum, Aquae Helveticae, Thermopolis, Thermae Helveticae, Bada, Badena, Badenia, all which names, as well as its origin and increase, it owes to the warm-baths, for which it was famous, according to Tacitus, long before his time. They lie a little out of the town, on both sides of the Limnat, and are distinguished by the names of the great and small baths. The waters are hot in the third degree, being strongly impregnated with sul∣phur, and a mixture of alum and nitre. They are used for many distempers, particularly sterility in wo∣men, either by bathing or drinking. Here are also two castles, an old and a new, the latter of which is the residence of the bailiff; a bridge over the river, but without rails; a council-house, in which the ge∣neral assemblies of the cantons are sometimes held; with several churches and convents; the inhabi∣tants being partly protestants, and partly papists. A great many Roman coins, and other antiquities, have been found here, which is a kind of proof that the bath waters were known and used in antient times. The imperial ambassador generally resides in this
<PB N="421" REF="4250"/>
town, near which are some visible remains of a Ro∣man way, made by order of Trajan. Within its pre∣cinct, Baden is possessed of both jurisdictions; some branches of the revenue also belong to it. In the war in 1712, the popish cantons placed a garri∣son in this town; notwithstanding, it was besieged by the cantons of Zurich and Bern, and obliged to surrender. The harbour on the river belongs to the town, but the customs to the regent-cantons. In its neighbourhood are found small square stones, called Baden-dice, which were once thought to be natural, but are now found to be artificial, and of bone.</P>
<P>Klingnau, a small town on the Aren, belong∣ing, with its district, to the bishop of Constance, under the sovereignty of the two cantons. Two other small towns, viz. Zurzach and Kaiserstuhl, with their districts, belong to the bishop of Con∣stance. Certain convents also have districts and jurisdictions belonging to them in this county.</P>

<HEAD>The FREE AMTS or ProVINCES.</HEAD>
<P>These are divided into Upper and Lower, and bounded to the south by the canton of Lu∣cern, to the north by the county of Baden, to the east by the cantons of Zurich and Zug, and to the west by those of Bern and Lucern. The soil is very fruitful, and the inhabitants all Ro∣man catholics, under the bishop of Constance. Of the Upper the eight old cantons are joint so∣vereigns; but of the Lower, the cantons of Zu∣rich, Bern, and Glaris. The only place in them worth mentioning is Muri, an opulent and cele∣brated Benedictine abbey, on the river Bunz, the abbot of which is a prince of the empire, and immediately under the pope.</P>
<P>Under the joint sovereignty of Zurich, Bern, and Glaris, are also the towns of Bremgarten and
<PB N="422" REF="4260"/>
Mellingen. Bremgarten stands on the river Reusz, eight miles south of Baden. It is a pleasant town, rich and well built, having a great trade, especially in the manufacture of paper. The inhabitants who are papists, under the bishop of Constance, are possessed of the high and low jurisdiction, and even of the privilege of trying capital causes, and of hanging and beheading; but appeals, in civil causes, lie to the regent cantons. Mellingen is a small town, about six miles from Baden, and four∣teen from Zurich, on the river Reusz, over which it has a bridge. Mr. Addison says, that, when he was there, the landlord's son of the inn, where he lodged, was an avoyer, and that his appointments amounted to about thirty pounds: and that the se∣veral councils met every Thursday, on affairs of state, as the reparation of a trough, or pavement, the church, or bridge. The inhabitants, who are papists, are not above a thousand in number, and the men are almost all blacksmiths, farriers, or locksmiths.</P>
<P>Of the common bailiwics in Switzerland, the re∣maining four, viz. those of Schwarzenburg, Mo∣rat Grandson, and Eschalons, are under the joint sovereignty of Bern and Freyburg. The inhabi∣tants of the three first are protestants; but those of the last are some protestants, and some papists. They take their names from the principal places in them: of these Morat and Grandson are conside∣rable towns. The former stands on a large lake, to which it gives name, near which, in 1746, the army of Charles, duke of Burgundy, was defeated, with great slaughter. In the bailiwic of Eschalons is a small town called Orbe, standing on a little ri∣ver of the same name, and commanding a view of the lake of Yverdun. It is said to be the antient Urba, where the Urbegeni dwelt.</P>

<P>These bailiwics lie in Italy, at the foot of the Alps. The inhabitants are all papists, and speak the Italian language. There are seven of them, viz. Bellenz, Riviera or Polese, Valle di Bregno, Lauis, Luggarus, Meynthal or Val Maggia, and Mendris. The three first belong to the cantons of Schweiz, Uri, and Underwald; but the other four to the cantons in general, excepting Appenzel. They are bounded on the west and south by the duchy of Milan, on the east by the Milanese and the Grisons, and on the north by the canton of Uri, and were antiently a part of the Milanese; but most of them were ceded to the Switzers, in 1512, by Maximilian Sforza, duke of Milan, for assisting him against France, and confirmed to them by Francis I. king of France, when he was was master of the Milanese: but Appenzel has no share in them, because it was not a member of the confederacy at the time when they were ceded. Every two years the regent cantons alternately nominate a bailiff over them.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Bellenz yields excellent pasturage for cattle, abundance of chesnuts, and some good wine. Its capital, Bellenz, is a considerable town, not far from the conflux of the Ticino and Maesa. The town, and most of the bailiwic, are in the dio∣cese of Como, the rest in that of Milan.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Riviera is watered by the Ticino, and contains nine parishes, but no town, nor other place of any note.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of the Valle de Bregno or Blegno, is environed by lofty mountains, but yields several kinds of grain and fruit, especially chesnuts, and some wine. It abounds also in cattle. Most of the male inhabitants go to work all summer in Italy,
<PB N="424" REF="4280"/>
and other countries, and return towards winter with their gains. This district submitted to the canton of Uri about the year 1500, but with a re∣serve of its liberties. In spirituals it is under the bishop of Milan.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Lauis, or Lagano, contains no less than an hundred and six populous small towns and villages, with the greatest part of the lake which gives name to it. It was ceded to the cantons by the duke of Milan, in 1512, for reasons already as∣signed. Most of it is in the diocese of Como, and a small part in that of Milan. Dr. Burnet, speaking of this bailiwic, says, it is owing to the mild go∣vernment the country is under that it is so popu∣lous, though naturally very barren and unfruitful. He observes also, that the bailiffs of the reformed or protestant cantons, must be contented with private devotions in their own house, because the Spa∣niards, when they confirmed the right of the can∣tons to these territories, expresly provided, that no religion should be tolerated but the Romish.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Luggarus contains forty-nine parishes, and a part of the Lago Maggiore, in La∣tin, Lacus Verbanus. It has three or four fruitful vallies, and is watered by some fine rivers, which all run into the lake. The mountains yield plenty of wine, and in the vallies they have a crop of wheat and rye in June, and another of millet, panick, or other grain, in October. They have also plenty of cattle and goats, butter, cheese, and chesnuts, of which last they make bread; besides figs, apples, pomegranates, olives, oranges, quinces, and woods of larch and fir trees, which they transport by the lake to Pavia, Milan, &amp;c. In this bailiwic is a valley called Centovalli, i. e. the Hundred Vallies, as consisting of a great number of small ones, which form a very wild romantic scene.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="4290"/>
The bailiwic of Meynthal, or Val Maggia, takes its name from the river Maggia, which traverses it. It is about twenty-eight miles in length, but contains no place of any note.</P>
<P>Mendris, the last of the seven Italian bailiwics, takes its name from a small inconsiderable place, and is almost surrounded with the duchy of Milan.</P>
<P>Under the protection of the four forest towns, namely, Lucern, Uri, Schweiz, and Underwalden, are Engelberg abbey, and the borough of Gersau. The abbey, with its annexed barony, lies between the cantons of Underwald, Uri, and Bern; and in spirituals is subject to the bishop of Constance. The high and low jurisdiction in the barony be∣longs to the abbey, which, in many other places, has considerable incomes and privileges. The title of the abbot is baron of Engleberg. As to the borough of Gersau, and its district, they lie towards the lower part of the lake of Lucern, or of the four forest towns, in German, Vierwald∣stadtersee. The inhabitants of the borough are absolutely free, and amount to about a thousand. The district, which is about six miles in length, and three in breadth, contains two small places, one called the Rothen-Schuh, i. e. the Red Shoe; and the other Rothen-Schuh-am-see, or the Red Shoe on the lake.</P>

<HEAD>Of the ALLIES of the CANTONS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus described the thirteen can∣tons, with their common bailiages and sub∣jects, we next proceed to treat of the allies of the Swiss, and their subjects. By allies are here to be understood, those only who are united to the can∣tons by a solemn league, in consequence of which they are always summoned to the legislative diets, and have a vote in those assemblies.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Abbey of St. GALL.</HEAD>
<P>The abbot of St. Gall is sovereign of that called the patrimony of St. Gall, situated between the canton of Zurich, and the lake of Constance, with other districts. The abbey, which is of the Bene∣dictine order, and lies in the town of St. Gall, is said to have been founded by Gallus, a Scotsman, who after having converted the Suevi, or Swabians, with the assistance of his countryman, Columba∣nus, retired to Switzerland. It is surrounded by high walls, and has one gate opening into the town, and another towards its territory. Within the walls is also the abbot's palace, with a conven∣tual church, in which are preserved the bones of St. Gall, and a library, famous for its an∣tient and rare manuscripts. The number of the monks is sixty, by, and from among whom, the abbot is chosen, who is immediately subject to the pope, and a prince of the empire; but he has no seat nor vote in the diet thereof, nor furnishes any quota or tax, though he takes the investiture of his territories, and the regalia, from the emperor. As an ally of the cantons, his deputies have a seat and voice in the general diets and meetings of the
<PB N="427" REF="4310"/>
confederacy. He has his hereditary steward, mar∣shal, cupbearer, and chamberlain; and, besides the county of Toggenburg, and what is called the Old Territory, with his possessions in the Thurgau, and Upper Rheinthal, he has some lordships in Swabia, with certain rights and jurisdictions in other parts of Germany. In these his territories he has the disposal of all benefices, and the nomi∣nation of all judges and officers, and, it is said, can raise five or six thousand men. The old district, and the county of Toggenburg, are subject in spirituals to the bishop of Constance, under certain limitations; but many of the inhabitants are pro∣testants. The county was formerly purchased by one of the abbots, at a very low rate.</P>
<P>The Old Territory, as it is called, is about twenty-seven miles long, and half as much in breadth; and is bounded on the east by the lake of Constance, on the south by the canton of Appenzel, and on the north and west by the Thurgau. The soil here is good, and the inhabitants Roman catholics. Appeals lie from its courts to the Aulic coucils, as they are stiled, at St. Gall, or Weil. The only places in in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Rorschach, a considerable well built town, near the lake of Constance, over against Lindau. Here are two convents, and a gymnasium, with a great manufacture and bleachery of linen, besides a large trade in corn, fruits, cattle, and wine.</P>
<P>Wyl, or Weil, a small town, with considerable privileges. Here is a court, at the head of which is the landeshauptman, appointed by the four pro∣tecting cantons, for determining all appeals from the inferior country courts. Near the town are also two convents.</P>
<P>The county of Toggenburg stretches from north to south between the canton of Appen∣zel
<PB N="428" REF="4320"/>
on the east, and that of Zurich and the county of Gaster on the west. It is about thirty miles in length, and nine in breadth; and the inhabitants are some papists and some protestants. The militia amount to about nine thousand men. The county abounds in cattle, and lies partly in the diocese of Coire, and partly in that of Con∣stance. It came to the abbey of St. Gall, by purchase, in the year 1468. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the inhabitants, to deliver themselves from the exactions and op∣pressions of the abbot Leodger, the son of a shoe-maker, took up arms, which, at last, drew on a war, in which the cantons of Zurich and Bern sided with the county, and those of Schweiz and Glaris with the abbot; but the protestant cantons having gained two battles, the abbot, in 1718, was fain to come to an accommodation, by which the liberties of the Toggenburgers were so∣lemnly confirmed. All fines and forfeitures be∣long to the abbot, who appoints most of the judges and officers; but there is a council nomi∣nated by the people, for the maintenance of their liberties, and for imposing and levying taxes, and other purposes. One half also of the judges, in the lower courts, are nominated by the county parishes. The only religions tolerated are the po∣pish and Calvinism; the professors of which are en∣titled to an equal share in all offices, courts, and councils. Lichtensteig, a small town on the river Thur, is the capital of the county.</P>

<PB N="429" REF="4330"/>
<HEAD>The Town of ST. GALL.</HEAD>
<P>St. Gall is a fine large town, in the Upper Thurgau, near the river Steinach, six miles from the lake, and thirteen from the city of Constance. It owed its origin to the abbey; but the inhabitants are now Calvinists. Here are several churches, with a gymnasium, in which is the city-library, a town-house, alms-house, and arsenal. Though the territory belonging to the town is barren, the inhabitants are generally rich, and live at their ease, having a great trade in linen, with eight bleaching∣grounds, and several fulling-mills along the river Sittern; besides, the town is a great thorough∣fare betwixt Germany and Italy. Its situation near the lake also is very advantageous to it, and tho' it was formerly subject to the abbot, yet it is now a republic, and sends deputies to the general diet; but the government is aristocratical. Here are se∣ven companies of citizens, one of which consists of gentlemen and traders of good families; two councils, a greater and lesser; three burgomasters, and other officers, and several courts of justice. Besides the burghers, who are well disciplined, there is a company of matrosses and bombardiers, one of light infantry, two of granadiers, and a troop of horse. In 1454 it entered into a perpetual al∣liance with the cantons of Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Schweiz, Zug, and Glaris. The precinct depen∣dent on the town is small, but it has a lordship in the landgravate of the Thurgau, over which it ap∣points a bailiff every sixth year.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Town of BIEL.</HEAD>
<P>This town stands upon the lake to which it gives name, and is under the sovereignty of the bishop
<PB N="430" REF="4340"/>
of Basil; but that prelate, at his accession to the regency, and the chapter, sign an instrument, by which they engage to maintain the inhabitants in all their rights and liberties. Having entered at different times into a perpetual union with the towns of Bern, Freyburg, and Salothurn, it is con∣sidered as an associate of the confederacy, and has a vote in all the general diets. There is a small district under its jurisdiction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GRISON LEAGUES.</HEAD>
<P>The country of the Grisons is bounded on the north by the counties of Surgans and Blu∣denz, the canton of Glaris, and the principa∣lity of Lichtenstein; on the south by the cantons Italian bailiwics, the county of Chavenne, and the Valteline; on the east by the territories of Venice and Milan; and on the west by some of the Italian bailiwics, and the canton of Uri. It is divided in∣to three leagues, viz. the Grison or Grey league, the league of the house of God, and that of the ten Jurisdictions. The two first lie towards the south, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above seventy miles, and the breadth about sixty. The inhabitants are said to have had the name of Grisons from the grey coats they wore in former times. This country, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous; but the mountains yield good pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats, with some rye and barley: in the vallies there is plenty of grain, pulse, fruits, and wine, with mineral springs; good hay also is made there. This country also abounds with hogs and wild fowl; but there is a scarcity of fish and salt, and their horses are mostly purchased of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are also several lakes, most of
<PB N="431" REF="4350"/>
which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Grisons is either a corrupt Italian, or the German. About two-thirds of the inhabitants are Calvinists, and the rest papists; the latter of whom in spirituals, are under the bishop of Coire, ex∣cept a few that are in the diocese of Como. Each of the leagues is subdivided into several lesser com∣munities, which are so many democracies, every male, above sixteen, having a share in the go∣vernment of the community, and a vote in the election of magistrates. Deputies from the seve∣ral communities constitute the general diet of the Grison leagues, which meets annually, and alter∣nately, at the capital of each league; but they can conclude nothing without the consent of their con∣stituents. This country was antiently a part of Rhetia. After the extinction of the Roman em∣pire in the west, it was sometime subject to its own dukes, or those of Swabia. Then the bishop of Coire, and other petty princes, dependent on the emperors of Germany, became masters of great part of it: at last, by the extinction of its lords, purchase voluntary grants, and force the Refor∣mation, it got rid of all its lords, and erected itself into three distinct republics, each of which, as we observed already, are subdivided into a certain number of communities, which are a sort of re∣publics, exercising every branch of sovereignty, except that of making peace or war, sending em∣bassies, concluding alliances, and enacting laws relating to the whole country, which belong to the provincial diets of the several leagues. The communities may be compared to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the several leagues to the provincial states. The particular diets are com∣posed of a deputy from each community; and both in them, and the communities, every thing is determined by a majority of votes. In the com∣munities
<PB N="432" REF="4360"/>
every male, above sixteen, has a vote. Besides the annual provincial diets for chusing the chiefs, and other officers, and deliberating on the affairs of the respective leagues, there are general diets for what concerns all the three leagues, or whole body. In both these, the representatives can do nothing of themselves, but are tied down to the instructions of their principals: however, as all resolutions are decided by the plurality of votes, and as the protestants are at least two-thirds of the people, this republic may be deemed a pro∣testant state. There is a general seal for all the three leagues; and each particular league has a separate seal. Besides the stated times of meeting, extraordinary diets are sometimes summoned, when either the domestic affairs of the state, or any fo∣reign minister require it. In the general diets, the Grey league has twenty-eight votes, that of the house of God twenty-three, and that of the Ten Jurisdictions fifteen. These leagues, at different times, have entered into close alliances with the neighbouring cantons, and their associates. The bailiwics belonging in common to the three leagues are those of the Valteline, Chieavene, Bormio, Meyenfeld, Malans, and Jennins; the officers of which are nominated successively by the several communities, every two years. The yearly re∣venue arising to the Grisons from their bailiwics is said to amount to about thirteen thousand five hun∣dred florins. The public revenues altogether are but small, though there are many private per∣sons in the country that are rich. However, in case of any extraordinary emergency, they tax themselves in proportion to the necessity of the ser∣vice, and the people's abilities. They have no re∣gular troops, but a well disciplined militia, and upon occasion, it is said, can bring a body of thirty thousand fighting men into the field: but their
<PB N="433" REF="4370"/>
chief security arises from the narrow passes and high mountains by which they are surrounded.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GREY LEAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>This league is divided into eight great di∣stricts, called councils, and twenty-three commu∣nities, of which eighteen are popish. The inha∣bitants are said to amount to fifty thousand, and of these ten thousand are able to carry arms. The principal places in the league are,</P>
<P>Ilanz, a small town, at the foot of a hill, but the chief place in the league, in which every three years the general diet of the Grisons is held. It gives name to a community, the inhabitants of which are Calvinists.</P>
<P>Disentis, a market-town on the Hither Rhine, giving name to another community. Here is a famous Benedictine abbey, the abbot of which is a prince of the empire, and has great privileges and authority in this league.</P>
<P>Truns, a village, in which the annual diet of this league is held.</P>
<P>Rezuns, a village, which gives name to a lord∣ship, belonging to the house of Austria.</P>
<P>Tusis, a market town, deriving its name and origin from the Tusci, or Tuscans, who formerly settled here.</P>
<P>Splugen, a small town on the Hither Rhine, in the vale of the Rheinwald. Dr. Burnet says, it is so great a thoroughfare betwixt Germany and Italy, that not less than one hundred pack-horses, at a me∣dium, go through it every day; and that the inha∣bitants, who are almost all carriers, drive a great trade, and seem to live very happy.</P>
<P>The valley of Calankerthal, in this league, is so barren, that the men of it stroll about in troops, hiring themselves out to the most sordid drudge∣ries,
<PB N="434" REF="4380"/>
whilst the women and children beg for a livelihood.</P>
<P>In this league is the source of the Rhine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LEAGUE of the HOUSE of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>This league is thought to derive its name from the cathedral of the bishopric of Chur, which stands in it. It is upwards of eighty miles in length, and sixty in breadth where widest, and contains some very high mountains. The chief of this league has the title of president, and like those of the others, is elected annually. Its diet is held at the same time and place as the general diet, namely, at Coire, and, in both, it has twenty-three votes. It lies in the south-east part of the Grisons country, and is divided into two great communi∣ties, and these again into twenty-one smaller, called jurisdictions; the inhabitants of which are mostly protestants. About Coire, and the banks of the Rhine, they have fruit of all sorts, except oranges and olives. The number of the inhabitants is said to be about forty thousand, of which seven or eight thousand are fit to bear arms. Places of most note in this league are,</P>
<P>Coire, or Chur, the capital not only of the league, but of the whole republic. It is called in Latin Curia Rhetorum, and stands on the river Plessur, which a little below falls into the Rhine, where that river begins to be navigable, and conse∣quently of great service to the trade of the place. The neighbourhood of the town is beautifully di∣versified with hills, plains, vineyards, corn-fields, and orchards. The inhabitants are all Calvinists. The town is very populous, and pretty large, con∣taining several churches, with the arsenal, and re∣cord office of the whole republic, a college be∣longing in common to the three leagues, a gram∣mar-school,
<PB N="435" REF="4390"/>
a granary, and a town-house, in which is held, once in three years, the general diet, and also the extraordinary diets, and the congresses. It has also, from time immemorial, been possessed of the right of coinage. The bishopric, to which it gives name, is very antient, and, before the Re∣formation, had great power, and a large revenue annexed to it. The bishop has still a revenue of upwards of a thousand pounds sterling, and is a prince of the empire, though he furnishes no con∣tingent. According to the rights and privileges claimed by this league, no bishop ought to be chosen, nor any of the episcopal effects and pos∣sessions allienated, without its consent and appro∣bation, nor any employments dependent on the see conferred on any but members of the league; yet those claims have not of late been much re∣garded by the bishop and chapter. For the government of the city, there is a greater and lesser council, besides several courts of justice, bur∣gomasters, and other officers. The bishop, in spi∣rituals, is subject to the archbishop of Mentz. His chapter consists of twenty-four canons, but of these only six have salaries, who live together with the bishop on an eminence just without the city of Coire, called the Hoff, which is enclosed with walls and gates, and in which also stands the cathedral. The bishop has estates and incomes, not only among the Grisons, but elsewhere, par∣ticularly in Tyrol. The greater part of the inha∣bitants of his diocese are now protestants.</P>
<P>Poschiavo, a handsome town, which gives name to a pleasant valley, lying between high mountains, and containing a lake. The road to and from the Valteline and Engaden passing through it, occasi∣ons a great deal of business.</P>
<P>The valley of Engaden, in this league, is di∣vided into the upper and lower, being large and
<PB N="436" REF="4400"/>
populous, and, in general, very fertile. The in∣habitants are all Calvinists, and their language is called Laden, from its near affinity to the Latin. In the valley of Upper Engadin, and the commu∣nity of St. Moritz, is a mineral water, which sur∣passes even that of Pyrmont.</P>
<P>The valley of Munsterthal takes its name from a rich abbey of nuns that stands in it.</P>
<P>There are some estates and royalties in this league belonging to the house of Austria.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The League of the TEN JURISDICTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>This is the smallest of the three, is divided into seven great communities, out which the chief is annually chosen by turns. To make up the ten jurisdictions, Dr. Burnet says, that three of the great communities are subdivided each into two jurisdictions. In the general diet this league has fifteen votes. It purchased for itself, in the year 1649, all the prerogatives which the house of Au∣stria was possessed of in the country. The greater part of the inhabitants are protestants; and the language of all, except a village or two, is Ger∣man. The public is very poor, though particular persons are generally very rich. The country is about twenty-five miles in length, and the same in breadth, and consists, for the most part, of rugged desert mountains, yielding neither corn nor fruit, except on the banks of the Rhine, and a few other places, but abounding in horses, cattle, fish, milk, butter, and chese, of all which there is a considera∣ble exportation. Bleau reckoned the men about fifteen thousand, of whom four thousand were fit to bear arms. In the community of Davos are said to be mines of silver, lead, and copper, but none of them are wrought. In the great church of the same community is held the general diet every
<PB N="437" REF="4410"/>
three years, and there also the archives and ban∣ners of the league are kept. In the community of Castels, and others, are mineral waters and baths. The only town in the league is that of</P>
<P>Mayenfeld, which gives name to a great com∣munity, and contains a large warehouse for mer∣chandize, going to or from Italy by the way of St. Lucius Steig, which is a very narrow pass, leading from the country of the Grisons into Germany. The district of Mayenfeld belongs to all the three leagues, having been purchased by them in common, and produces a pretty good wine.</P>
<P>Malix is a large parochial village, in the com∣munity of Churwalden.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The countries or territories subject to the three GRISONS leagues lie at the foot of the ALPS, near the entrance of Italy, and consist of the Valteline, and the counties of Bormio and Chiavenna.</HEAD>
<P>The Valteline, in Latin, Vallis Tellina, is upwards of thirty miles in length, and from eight to twenty in breadth. It is exceeding fruit∣ful and pleasant, being watered by the Adda, which abounds with fish, screened from the northern blasts by high mountains, and beautifully inter∣spersed with corn-fields, meadows, vineyards, chesnut, and other fruit trees. There is a red wine produced here, of a most delicious flavour, and so strong a body, that it will keep a whole cen∣tury, improving both in taste and wholesomeness, and gradually turning paler, till at length its red∣ness totally disappears. The culture of silk and wine cheifly engrossing the attention of the inha∣bitants, grazery is too much neglected, and even a part of the corn consumed in the country is im∣ported. Here are several baths and mineral waters,
<PB N="438" REF="4420"/>
with some iron works. So fertile is the country, where duly cultivated, that they have sometimes three crops in a year; the first of wheat, the second of millet, and the third of turnips, or other garden∣stuff. The strength of the wine is in a great mea∣sure owing to the situation of the mountains, which running east and west, the vineyards have the be∣nefit of the sun the whole day. The trouts of the Adda are fat and delicious, and so large, that they weigh from fifty to sixty pounds. The language of the country is a corrupt Italian, and the religion popery; there were formerly many protestants here, but they were all massacred, in the year 1620, without regard to age, sex, or quality. This country, as well as those of Bormio and Chia∣venna, belonged antiently to the see of Chur; but having been wrested from it by the dukes of Milan, and recovered again with the assistance of the three leagues, the bishop, in 1530, transferred all the rights of his see to the leagues, on condition, that every two years, five hundred and seventy-three florins should be paid to the bishop for the time, being out of the customs levied at Chiavanna. The principal officers in the Valteline are appointed every two years by the Grisons. Every two years also, each league sends three deputies, with two clerks and a lawyer, to hear the complaints of the people against the officers set over them, and to redress their grievances. The inhabitants are pos∣sessed of particular privileges, and have the choice of certain officers. The name of the county is de∣rived from the village of Tell, situated on the top of a hill. There are vessels used in the kitchens here and almost all over Lombardy, made of a stone called lovege, which feels oily and scaly, and is somewhat of the nature of slate. This stone is dug out of three mines, one near Chiavenna, another in this country, and a third in that of the Grisons.
<PB N="439" REF="4430"/>
Dr. Burnet says, that the pots made of this stone boil meat sooner than those of metal, though their bottoms are twice as thick at the other. The pas∣sage into the mine here is not above three feet wide, for near half a mile, through a rock; so that they who draw out the stones creep all along on their bellies, having a candle fastened to their foreheads, and the stone laid on a sort of cushion made for it on their hips. This country is defended by mountains, through which there are narrow passes, where a few men may withstand great armies. Bleau computed the inhabitants at about twenty-five thousand, of which four thousand were fit to bear arms. Their chief trade is in wine, cattle, hides, tallow, butter, and cheese. Travellers ob∣serve, that there is scarce a people upon earth that live under a milder government, and enjoy greater privileges, than those of the Valteline. It is a pleasant valley, stretched out between the lake of Como on the west, and Tyrol on the east, with the country of the Grisons on the north, and the dominions of Venice on the south; and is divided into three terzeros, or thirds, which are subdi∣vided into communities. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Sonders, or Sondrio, the capital; and the re∣sidence of the bailiffs and vicario, standing on the Maler, which, a little below, falls into the Adda.</P>
<P>Tirano, a large, populous town, situated nine miles south-east of Sondrio, on the Adda.</P>
<P>Morben, a considerable town, situated on the river Bitto, eight miles from the lake of Como, and sixteen from Sondrio, and containing several convents.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="440" REF="4440"/>
<HEAD>The Country of BORMIO, called by the Ger∣mans WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>This country is environed on all sides by high mountains, of which there are also many within it. The air is pure and healthy, and the soil, though it yields no wine, and little fruit, yet is fruitful in corn, honey, iron ore, and rich pastures, which feed great numbers of cows, sheep, and goats. The Adda has its source in this country. The inhabitants are all papists, and amount to about fourteen thousand. They have a governor, ap∣pointed by the Grisons, and stiled a podestat; but enjoy all their antient rights and privileges. The only place in the country of any note is that from which it takes its name, which stands near the Adda, twenty-two miles from Sondrio, forty from Chiavenna, and fifty from Coire. It is the resi∣dence of the governor, sent hither every two years from the Grisons, and is a pretty large populous place. One of the vales here is called Maglia Vaccha, or Eat Cow, from the many cows killed in it by falls from the neighbouring mountains; and another is stiled the Freel Valley, in Latin Vallis Fera, or Ferrea, from the iron-ore, smelting houses, and forges in it. A narrow defile between two high mountains, through which the Adda passes, is named Serra, or Seraglio.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The County of CHIAVENNA.</HEAD>
<P>This county is upwards of twenty miles long, and about eighteen in breadth. Though very mountainous, it is well peopled, and yields good pasture, fruits, and wines, but not a sufficiency of corn. The air in summer is excessive hot, but not unwholesome, except when loaded with vapours
<PB N="441" REF="4450"/>
from the lake of Como. The inhabitants employ a great number of pack-horses, and carry on a good trade in cattle, wine, silk, butter, cheese, and kitchen utensils, made of the stone or slate mentioned above. Besides the rivers Mera, or Maira, and Lira, here is a lake, called the Lago de Chia∣venna. The number of the inhabitants is said to be about five thousand, and their religion is the Roman catholic. The county is divided into two districts, over each of which an amtmann, or stew∣ard, is appointed by the Grisons every two years. The only place of any note in it is,</P>
<P>Chiavenna, a pretty large well built town, stand∣ing on the river Maira, eighteen miles from Son∣drio, and thirty-two from Coire. In the adjacent mountains are caves, in which the inhabitants lay up their wines; and in the town is a large ware∣house for goods consigned to Italy or Germany. Here one of the stewards resides, with the title of commissary. A part of the town was formerly de∣stroyed by the fall of a mountain.</P>
<P>There is a district here named Piuri, Piuro, or Plurs, from a town which, in the year 1618, was so overwhelmed by the fall of a mountain, that not the least trace of it hath since appeared. Over a hill, called the Splug-hill, there is a serpentine road hewn out among such rocks and precipices, that many who pass along it are seized with a vertigo.</P>
<P>In all the three countries above described, ches∣nuts are the ordinary food of the common people, and vines are said to thrive to such a degree, that there are sometimes near five hundred grapes on a small branch; and though land, in some places, sells for eighteen pence a yard, yet it produces five percent. profit.</P>

<HEAD>The Barony of HALDENSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>Haldenstein is a free independent barony, about three miles below Chur, on the Rhine. It is under the protection of the Grison Leagues, and takes its name from the village of Haldenstein, which has a palace in it, and a small castle above it. For the protection granted it by the Grisons, it is obliged, when required, to furnish them a certain number of men. The inhabitants are Calvinists. Its lord, stiled baron of Haldenstein and Lichtenstein, has all the prerogatives of a sovereign within the barony, together with the great and small tythes, the pa∣tronage of the churches, &amp;c. Until the year 1701 the inhabitants were under villenage, but were then released from it. Out of three persons recommended by the vassals, the baron nominates one for judge.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>VALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>Another ally of the Swiss cantons is the county of Valais, by the Switzers called Wallis, and in Latin Valesia. It is a valley among the Alps, hav∣ing Swisserland on the north and east, the Milanese and the duchy of Aosta on the south, and Savoy on the west, extending near an hundred miles in length, from east to west, and about thirty in breadth, be∣tween high mountains. It is exceeding fertile, yielding wheat, barley, rye, wine, saffron, apples, pears, plumbs, cherries, chesnuts, mulberries, small nuts, and, in some places, almonds, figs, pomegra∣nates, and other fine fruits. It abounds also in cat∣tle, game, and venison, has some hot baths and pits of coal, and is well watered by the Rhone, which traverses it from east to west. A great part of it formerly belonged to the bishop of Sion, who still
<PB N="443" REF="4470"/>
presides in the councils of the commonwealth, and has great influence in the management of their af∣fairs. Not only the German, French, and Italian, but even the Latin is spoken here, and that too by the common people, though very corruptly. The Valais is entirely popish, forming the diocese of Sion; and is divided into the Upper and Lower. The Upper, in the year 1475, having made a conquest of the Lower, the latter has ever since been subject to the former, though not without many privileges. A diet is held twice a-year, to which the seven communities, or tithings of Upper-Valais, send deputies. The government, excepting that of the Sion, which is aristocratical, is much the same as that of the Grisons. Most of the in∣habitants, we are told, have large wens, and are of a very diminutive size. The country is very popu∣lous, and contains thirty five parishes. The har∣vest generally begins in May in the vallies, but is not over on the mountains till October. Two sorts of crystal are found in the Valais, one very fine and clear, and the other duskish, or of a violet colour. Their woods abound with larch trees, which fur∣nish them with rozin and agaric. The air, though very hot in the vallies in summer, is so pure, that those who are temperate live to a great age. Most of the houses are of wood, especially of that of the larch tree, which is very durable, and grows at last as black as ebony. The chief places in the Upper-Valais are,</P>
<P>Sitten, in French Sion, the capital of the whole Valais, standing not far from the Rhine, on the river Sitten, from which it takes its name. It contains several churches and convents, and is the see of a bishop, who has no less than three palaces in the town, and stiles himself count and prefect of the Valais. He is chosen by the chapter, and the representatives of the seven tithings, and is subject
<PB N="444" REF="4480"/>
in spirituals to the archbishop of Moustiers, in Sa∣voy. The bishopric is very antient. The town is twenty miles from the lake, and fifty-four from the city of Geneva, eighty-five from Milan, and fifty from Bern.</P>
<P>Brug or Brig, which before the year 1755, when the greatest part of it was destroyed by an earthquake, was accounted the handsomest place in the whole Valais. It stands on the river Sal∣tana, not far from the Rhone, twelve miles south∣east of Sion. About three miles from it, and close by the Rhone, is a warm bath, of great virtue.</P>
<P>Naters, a large well built borough, which gives name to a parish.</P>
<P>Aernen, a considerable town, walled in.</P>
<P>Visp, a large village, standing twenty miles from Sion, and noted for its mines of chrystal, and for the birth of Dr. Felix Plater, a famous physi∣cian.</P>
<P>Leuck, a handsome village, giving name to a tything, in which is a warm bath much resorted to in summer, even from very distant parts. The diets are sometimes held here. At the end of the village begins Mount Gemmi, which, it is said, measures above ten thousand feet in height, yet there is a road over it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the LOWER-VALAIS, whose inhabitants are vas∣sals of the Upper, the only places of any note are,</HEAD>
<P>St. Maurice, a handsome borough on the Rhone, over which it has a stately stone bridge, which is a great thoroughfare for all goods and passengers go∣ing to or from the lake of Geneva, through the country of the Valais, and over the lofty moun∣tain called St. Bernardsberg. This place is sup∣posed to be the antient Agaunum, where, about
<PB N="445" REF="4490"/>
the end of the third century, the Theban legion, consisting entirely of Christians, suffered mar∣tyrdom.</P>
<P>Martigny, supposed to be the antient Octodu∣rum, a Roman colony, by Caesar called Vera∣grorum Vicus, is a great thoroughfare, standing on the river Dranse, which falls, a little below, in∣to the Rhone. Its neighbourhood is noted for two sorts of excellent wine, and it gives name to a castellany belonging to the bishop of Sion.</P>
<P>On the top of the mountain mentioned above, called St. Bernardsberg, is a convent, where all poor travellers, whether papists or protestants, are lodged and maintained three days gratis.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Town of MUHLHAUSEN,</HEAD>
<P>Another ally of the Swiss cantons, stands on the river Ill, in the Sundgau, about eighteen miles from Basil, being a large, well-built, populous town, adorned with several churches and other fair structures, both public and private. The in∣habitants are Calvinists. The town sends no de∣puty to the general diet of the Helvetic body, tho' it is still in alliance with the protestant cantons. The government and jurisdiction are entirely in the hands of the citizens.</P>

<HEAD>The Principality of NEUFCHATEL and county of Valangin</HEAD>
<P>Extend from north-east to south-west, be∣tween the Franche Comté and the lakes of Neuf∣chatel and Biel, being about thirty miles in length, and fifteen in breadth. The lower parts of them yield wine, fruits, corn, hemp, and flax, and those which lie on Mount Jura afford not only pasture for sheep and cattle, and woods, abounding with
<PB N="446" REF="4500"/>
deer and other game, but also metals, marble, pe∣trefactions, and chalk-pits. Here are also some celebrated mineral waters. The country is very populous, and the greatest part of the inhabitants are protestants. The current language is the French, but none of the purest, nor spoken with the true accent. Mary, duchess of Nemours, dy∣ing in 1707, several illustrious families put in their claims to these territories; but the high tribunal of Neufchatel, after a mature and impartial exami∣nation of the several claims, passed a decree in fa∣vour of the king of Prussia, on the third of No∣vember 1707, who immediately took possession of the principality, confirming to the inhabitants all their liberties and privileges, together with their alliances and communiy of rights with the can∣tons. Though the king stiles himself sovereign prince of Neufchatel and Valangin, yet his autho∣rity is pretty much limited by the privileges of the people; his edicts being of no force until they are confirmed by the assembly of the states. The ordinary administration of affairs is vested in the governor and council, appointed by the king. The revenue of the principality amounts to about forty thousand florins per annum, and its militia to between eight and nine thousand men. This country is called the key of Switzerland, on account of six passes, which lead from the former into the latter, and may be defended by a handful of men against the greatest armies. The only places worth notice in it are,</P>
<P>Neufchatel, which gives name to it, and is its capital, being stiled in Latin Neocomum, Novi∣castrum, or Neoburgum, and in German Neuen∣burg and Welsch-Neuenburg. It stands on the side of the lake, which takes its name from it, about twenty-seven miles long, and six broad,
<PB N="447" REF="4510"/>
and abounding in fish, but not very deep. The town, which is pretty large and tolerably well built, is commanded by a huge old castle on a hill, in which the governor resides. Its neigh∣bourhood is adorned with vineyards, gardens, and seats, and it enjoys great privileges, being ex∣empted, in particular, from all imposts and tithes. It is said to have been built by the emperor Con∣rade, in 1034. In 1406 its first alliance was con∣cluded with Bern, which hath been frequently re∣newed since that time; and, in 1530, it embraced the Reformation.</P>
<P>Landeron, a town seated at the influx of the Zil or Thielle into the Biel lake.</P>
<P>Boudry, a small town, which, as well as the former, gives name to a district.</P>
<P>Valangin, a small town and castle at the foot of Mount Jura, which gives name to the county. In one of the summits of Mount Jura, in this county, near a village called La Cote aux Fees, is to be seen a very superb Pagan temple, hewn out of a rock, in which Mercury was consulted by means of certain prophetesses, called in French Fees.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The City of GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P>The republic of Geneva consists of the city and a small territory. The city, called in Latin also Geneva, but in German Genf, and in French Ge∣nevé, is situated where the Rhone makes its exit from the lake, sixty-five miles from Bern, seventy-five from Lyons, and an hundred and six from Turin. A part of it stands on an island in the Rhone, and part on the banks on both sides, being a handsome well fortified city, and pretty large. In some of the streets are arched walks or piazzas. The Treille is a most charming place, planted with linden trees, and commanding a fine prospect
<PB N="448" REF="4520"/>
of the lake, and of several ranges of mountains and rocks, rising behind one another; some co∣vered with vineyards and herbage, and others with snow, with openings betwixt them. Immediately below the city the Rhone is joined by the Arve. Over the former of these rivers are four bridges. The inhabitants of Geneva are mostly Calvinists. Of the six churches, the cathedral of St. Peter is the principal, in which is a monument to the memory of Henry duke of Rohan. The service in some of these churches is in French, in others in Italian, and in others in German. The guildhall is a stately free∣stone edifice, situated on an eminence, the ascent to which is without any steps, so that a person may not only walk, but ride from the top to the bot∣tom. Here is an arsenal, which is said to contain arms for twelve thousand men; and an university, which has twelve professors belonging to it, with a very valuable library. Several learned men have either been natives, or professors and ministers of this city; particularly Calvin, Theodore Beza, the Diodati, the Turretines, the late Mr. Le Clerc, and others. As the quantity of corn produced in the territory of the city is not sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, the republic has erected large granaries, which always contain a quantity sufficient to supply the inhabitants two years. The bakers, the inn-keepers, the garrison, and the artificers employed by the city, are obliged to take what corn they want from these granaries, at a small advance of the prime cost. Besides the re∣venue arising from hence, the city has other in∣comes, amounting to about an hundred and thirty thousand dollars, with part of which it maintains a garrison consisting of eight hundred men, well dis∣ciplined, and cloathed in a blue uniform, turned up with red. The environs of the city are ex∣tremely pleasant, which, with the goodness of the
<PB N="449" REF="4530"/>
air and provisions, the mildness of the govern∣ment, the politeness of the inhabitants, the num∣bers of foreign gentlemen always residing here, or passing from France, Germany, and other countries to the north of the Alps, to Italy, and others lying south of them, render it a most agree∣able place: hence Mr Addison stiled it, very just∣ly, the court of the Alps. In all the streets are fountains and canals to supply the inhabitants with water, which is raised by engines from the Rhone. The trade of the city is very considerable, it being a great thoroughfare, and having a variety of ma∣nufactures, with a number of industrious and in∣genious artificers, particularly in the watch-making branch. The library belonging to the city is well furnished with excellent books, besides a curious collection of medals and petrefactions, and some antient manuscripts. They are not so rigid in keeping the sabbath here as the Calvinists in Eng∣land and Scotland; for they tolerate, and even au∣thorize, all manner of manly exercises on Sundays, after divine service; and then it is that the militia also are exercised. The sun rises later here, and sets sooner, than in most other places of the same latitude, which is owing to the Alps. Mr. Addison says, that there are merchants in Geneva that are reckoned worth two millions of crowns, though, perhaps, not one of them spends five hundred pounds a-year. At the general hospital, besides the city poor, poor travellers are maintained for one day, and then dis∣missed, with some money in their pockets, to pro∣ceed on their journey. As to the government, it is much like that of Zurich and Bern. The number of burghers is about fifteen hundred, and the prin∣cipal magistrates are the four syndics. There are no less than four councils, viz. the general council of the citizens and burghers, the council of two hundred, that of sixty, and that of twenty-five.
<PB N="450" REF="4540"/>
Of the last, two persons of the same family cannot be members at the same time. A son here, who refuses to pay his father's debts, is incapable of any office in the state. No marriages are permit∣ted unless both parties are of the protestant reli∣gion. A woman of forty years of age must not marry a man of less than thirty; if she exceed forty, her husband must at least be thirty-five: nor must a man above sixty marry a woman who is not, at least, thirty. A widow must not alter her condi∣tion in less than six months after her husband's de∣cease. The kings of France and England are con∣stantly mentioned in their public prayers here. It is said that Calvin lies buried in that part of the church-yard called the Plain-palais; but the parti∣cular spot is either not known, or pretended not to be known. Before the Reformation, this city was the see of a bishop, who was possessed of the so∣vereignty thereof at first, jointly with its counts, and afterwards with the dukes of Savoy; but it got rid of both, about the period above-mentioned, and entered into alliance with several of the can∣tons: at present, however, those only with Bern and Zurich continue in force. The king of France always keeps a resident here. So much are the magistracy afraid of opening a door to luxury and licentiousness, that no theatre is per∣mitted in the city. The lake, to which it gives name, resembles a half-moon, whose convex side lies towards Switzerland. On that side it extends eighteen leagues, reckoning along the shore, but on the Savoy side not above twelve; and its great∣est breadth is upwards of seven. As for its depth, in some places it is said to be unfathomable. Con∣trary to most other lakes, it decreases in winter, and increases in summer, which is owing to the melting of the snow on the neighbouring moun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans. It is hardly ever frozen over, and has the ter∣ritories
<PB N="451" REF="4550"/>
of no less than five different states border∣ing on it, viz. the kingdom of France, the duchy of Savoy, the canton of Bern, the bishopric of Sion, and the republic of Geneva.</P>
<P>The bishop of Basil is also in alliance with the seven popish cantons, on account of a part of his territories which, having embraced the protestant religion, detached itself from the empire, and made an alliance with some of the cantons, though it still acknowledges the bishop as sovereign. In this part the principal places are, Biel, which we have given some account of already, and which is in al∣liance with Bern, Freyberg, and Solothurn; and Neuenstadt, a small town on the Biel lake, in al∣liance with Bern, where is a castle, which is the residence of the bishop's castellan.</P>

<HEAD>NAME, ORIGIN, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>BY the United Netherlands we understand those parts of them that belong to the States General. We shall describe those belonging to the house of Austria and Prussia separately; and of those pertaining to France, we shall give an account when we come to that country. These provinces had the general name of Netherlands, Low Coun∣tries, or Pais-Bas, from their situation in respect of Germany. Antiently they formed a part of Gal∣lia Belgica, and afterwards of the German empire and circle of Burgundy, being subject to several petty princes. In the sixteenth century all the pro∣vinces became subject to Charles V. of the house of Austria. Under his son Philip II. of Spain, being grievously oppressed and persecuted, they took up arms to assert their liberty, and were sup∣ported
<PB N="453" REF="4570"/>
and assisted in the struggle by the prince of Orange and his brother, and afterwards by queen Elizabeth of England, till at last those, now called the United-Provinces, formed themselves into a separate state by a solemn league and union, and, in the year 1609, were acknowledged by Spain to be free and independent. These provinces, in∣cluding the Generalité Lands, are bounded to the south by Austrian Flanders and Brabant; to the north and west by the Northern-sea or German∣ocean; and to the east by the duchies of Gueldres and Cleve, the bishopric of Munster, the county of Bentheim, and the principality of East-Fries∣land.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, FACE of the COUNTRY, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>A great part of them being surrounded by the sea, lying low, and abounding in marshes, the air, in consequence thereof, is damp and unwholesome, rains and fogs frequent, and the gout, scurvy, rheumatism, and agues, both rife and inveterate. The effects of human industry here are wonderful in the dykes and dams erected for defending the country against the inundations of the sea, and in the ditches, canals, mills, and sluices, for draining the marshes. The quantity of grain produced here is not suffi∣cient for home consumption; but the pastures in the marshes are so rich, that they can spare a great deal of butter and cheese for exportation. They have also a good breed of sheep, whose wool is highly valued, with turf, madder, tobacco, some fruit, and iron; but all the pit-coal and timber used in it, and indeed most of the comforts, and even the necessaries of life, are imported. All the provinces either lie upon, or communicate with the North-sea, by means of that called the Zuyder, or South-sea, which was formed partly
<PB N="454" REF="4580"/>
by the Rhine's right branch, then increased by the Vecht, which has now another outlet, over-flow∣ing the low swampy grounds through which it passed, and partly by the sea's breaking in, in the thirteenth century, and overflowing a large tract of ground contiguous to that before laid under water by the Rhine. The principal rivers are, the Rhine, the Maes, the Scheld, and the Vecht. The first is divided into several branches, one of which joins the Old Issel, and after that falls into the Zuyder-see; another named the Leck, at the village of Krimpen, mingles with the Maes; a third, called the Crooked Rhine, is branched out at Leyden into canals, of which one runs into the lake of Harlem, and another loses itself in the sand hills between Catwyk on the Rhine, and Catwyk on the sea; and a fourth, called the Waal, falls into the Maes over-against Workum. The Maes, after dividing itself into two branches, and again uniting these, falls into the North-sea, below Rotterdam. The Scheld below Antwerp divides itself into two branches, called the Western and Eastern Scheld; the first separating Flanders from Zealand, and the other running north by Bergen-op-Zoom, and af∣terwards east, between the islands of Beveland and Schowen, falls into the sea a little below. The Vecht runs from east to west through the province of Overyssel, and falls into the Zuyder-see. There are many smaller rivers that join these, and a vast number of canals; yet there are few good harbours in the provinces. The best are those of Rotterdam, Helvoetsluys, and Flushing. As to the harbour of Amsterdam, it is indeed one of the largest and safest in Europe; but there is a bar at the entrance of it, over which large vessels cannot pass, without being lightened, or unloaded. There are no mountains in these provinces; and the only lake, properly so called, is that of Harlem. The provinces are ex∣tremely
<PB N="455" REF="4590"/>
well cultivated, and very populous, espe∣cially that of Holland, which, in this respect, per∣haps has not its equal in the universe. The towns are very agreeable, being kept very clean, and having canals in the middle of the streets, planted with trees. The number of inhabitants is compu∣ted at about two millions. The animals here are much the same as in England; but their horses and horned cattle are of a larger size. Storks build and hatch on their chimnies; but, being birds of pas∣sage, they leave the country about the middle of August, with their young, and return the February following. It is said there are some wild boars and wolves here; and that neither oysters nor herrings are to be found upon the coast: but of other fish, they have the several sorts, both in their seas and rivers, that we have in England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION, UNIVERSITIES, and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The established religion here is the presbyterian, or Calvinism: none but presbyterians are admitted into any office or post in the government, except∣ing the army; yet all religions and sects are tole∣rated, and have their respective meetings or assem∣blses for public worship, among which the papists and Jews are very numerous. There are five uni∣versities in the provinces, viz. those of Utrecht, Leyden, Franeker, Groningen, and Harderwic; but the three last are inconsiderable. The dissen∣ters in England often send their children to these universities for education. Before the Reforma∣tion there was an archbishop at Utrecht, who had for his suffragans the bishops of Deventer, Gronin∣gen, Middleburg, Harlem, and Lewarden. The language here is a dialect of the German, but French is much spoken by the better sort.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>Their East-India company have had the mono∣poly of the fine spices for more than an hundred years, and is the most opulent and powerful of any in the world Though the country itself pro∣duces very few things, yet almost all the products and commodities of the globe may be found here, and nearly as cheap as in the countries where they are made or produced. A vast variety of manu∣factures are carried on in the provinces, and with extraordinary skill and diligence; and a great num∣ber of hands are employed, and much wealth ac∣quired by the herring, cod, and whale fisheries; though they are not so considerable, or advantage∣ous, as formerly. No nation has hitherto equalled them in the cure of herrings; those cured at Glas∣gow, in Scotland, are thought to come the nearest to them. About a hundred and fifty sail are annu∣ally employed in the whale fishery, and about two hundred in the herring. The profits of the latter, in a good year, after all deductions, are thought to amount to two millions of Holland guilders. The principal manufactures here are those of linen, paper, and earthen-ware of all sorts. Ship build∣ing also employs vast numbers of hands. The trade of this country, however, upon the whole, is said to be upon the decline, owing partly to a decline of their antient parsimony and industry, but chiefly to the improvement of manufactures, trade, and navigation, in other, countries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the coin here, every province being a sovereignty of itself, has of course the right of coinage; but all the pieces must be of the
<PB N="457" REF="4610"/>
same intrinsic value. The coins, real or imaginary, are a deut, worth about half a farthing; a grot Flemish, two farthings; a stiver, equal to a penny English; a dubbelchin, to two pence; a schilling, to six-pence; but there are schillings worth only five pence half-penny; a guilder, to twenty pence; a gold guilder, to fifty-eight; a thaler, or dollar, to thirty; a rixthaler, or rixdollar, to fifty; a lowenthaler, or lion-dollar, to forty-two; a du∣catoon, to sixty-three. The gold ducat is worth about eight shillings and eight pence; and the ruy∣der is almost equal in value to a guinea. Besides these, there are half and three guilder pieces, and half and quarter rixdollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the political constitution, most of the towns in the several provinces are little republics, whose deputies, with the nobility, compose the states thereof; and the deputies of provinces, in like manner, compose the states-general. Every town or province may send as many deputies as they please to the assemblies of the provincial states, or states-general; but those of each town or province have but one voice, and preside by turns. No resolution taken by the states-general is of any force, till it is confirmed by the several provinces. The legislative power in the towns is vested in the senates, and the executive in the burgomasters, syndics, &amp;c. The states of the provinces are stiled noble and mighty lords; but those of Holland, noble and most mighty lords; and the states-general, high and mighty lords, or the lords the states-general of the United-Netherlands, or their high mightinesses. Besides the states-general, there is also a council of state, consisting of deputies from the several provinces,
<PB N="458" REF="4620"/>
making twelve in all, of which Holland sends three, Gelderland, Zealand, and Utrecht, two a∣piece, and Friesland, Groningen, and Overyssel, one. In this council every deputy presides a week by turns, and the stadtholder has a decisive voice when the votes happen to be equal. The principal af∣fairs that come under their deliberation, are those relating to the army and finances. The stadtholder is also president of the states in every province, but has no seat in the states-general. One dissenting voice in the provincial states prevents their coming to any resolution. From the death of William III. prince of Orange and king of England, there had been no stadtholder, at least for the provinces of Holland, Zealand, and West-Friesland; but these also, in 1747, upon the French breaking into Dutch Flanders, made choice of William-Charles-Henry-Friso, prince of Orange, and father of the present stadtholder, William V. The stadtholdership was at the same time made hereditary to his heirs male and female, provided the latter did not marry the son of a king, or a papist. The stadtholder's powers and prerogatives are very considerable: in particular, he seems directly, or by his influence, to have the no∣mination of the magistrates, deputies, and most of the officers, civil and military. In short, though he has not the title, he has more real power and authority than many kings; for besides the influence and revenue he derives from the stadtholdership, he has several principalities, and large estates of his own. With respect to the administration of justice in this country, every province has its tribunal, to which, except in criminal causes, appeals lie from the petty and country courts; and it is said, that justice is no where distributed with more im∣partiality.</P>

<HEAD>TAXES and REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>The taxes in these provinces are so many, and so heavy, especially in Holland, that it is not with∣out reason that a certain author asserts, that the only thing that has escaped taxation there is the air they breathe. The ordinary revenues of the re∣public are computed at between two and three mil∣lions sterling annually. Out of a hundred guilders, the province of Holland contributes fifty-eight, and, consequently, above one half of the whole pub∣lic expences. For the encouragement of trade, the duties on goods and merchandize are said to be exceeding low. Notwithstanding the number and greatness of the taxes, every province is said to labour under very heavy debts, especially Hol∣land, and the public credit is not in the most flou∣rishing condition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORCES, by SEA and LAND.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to their land forces in time of peace, they seldom exceed forty thousand, and very often fall short of that number. They employ a great many foreigners, especially Swiss and Scots, in their service; and, in time of war, hire whole regiments of Ger∣mans. The chief command of the army is vested in the stadtholder, under whom is the field-marshal-general. In 1756 the expences of the army a∣mounted only to nine million seven hundred and sixty-five thousand and four guilders. No nation in the world can fit out a more formidable fleet than the Dutch, having always vast quantities of timber prepared for building of ships, and such numbers of ship-carpenters and mariners: howe∣ver, in times of peace, they usually have no more than thirty in commission, for the protection of
<PB N="460" REF="4640"/>
their trade in the Mediterranean, and to convoy the homeward-bound Indiamen, &amp;c. Their navy is under the direction of the five admiralty col∣leges, who, to defray the charges thereof, levy the duties on exports and imports.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER of the DUTCH.</HEAD>
<P>As to the character of the Dutch, the boors or husbandmen are industrious enough, but heavy, and slow of understanding. The seamen are a plain, blunt, but rough, surly, and ill-mannered sort of people. Their tradesmen are something sharper, and make use of all their skill to take advantage of the ignorance of those they deal with. Every class of men are extremely frugal. All appetites and passions run lower and cooler here than in other countries, avarice excepted. Quarrels are very rare, revenge is seldom heard of, and jealousy scarcely ever known. It is very uncommon for any of them to be really in love, or even to pretend to it; nor do the women seem to care whether they are or not. People converse pretty much upon a level here; nor is it easy to distinguish the man from the master, nor the maid from the mistress, such liber∣ties do they allow their servants, or rather are obliged to allow them, for they may not be struck or corrected by them, but the dispute must be left to the magistrate. The Dutch are tall and strong∣built; but both men and women have the grossest shapes that are to be met with any where, or rather no shape at all. Their garb, except among the of∣ficers of the army and some few others, is exceed∣ing plain, and the fashions change as seldom as in Spain. The men are addicted to drinking, which some think necessary in this foggy air, both for their health, and the improvement of their understandings. Among their diversions, that of
<PB N="461" REF="4650"/>
skaiting in winter is one of the chief. It is amaz∣ing to see the crowds in a hard frost upon the ice, and their great dexterity in skaiting; both men and women darting along, or rather fly∣ing, with inconceivable velocity. The Dutch are remarkable for their cleanliness: nothing can ex∣ceed the neatness of their houses, towns, and villages. Many of them have distinguished themselves by their learning, and some even by their wit and in∣genuity, witness Erasmus, Grotius, &amp;c. The Dutch excel also in painting and engraving, and some of them have been no contemptible statuaries. In our particular description of the seven provinces, we shall begin with Gelderland, as the first in rank.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GELDERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, (called North Gelderland, to di∣stinguish it from Upper Gelderland, belonging to Prussia) together with its appurtenance the county of Zutphen, is bounded to the west by Utrecht and Holland, on the east by the bishopric of Munster and the duchy of Cleve, on the north by the Zuy∣der-see and Overyssel, and on the south it is separated from Brabant by the Maes. Its greatest extent from north to south is about forty-seven miles, and from west to east near as much; but its figure is very irregular. The air here is much healthier and clearer than in the maritime provinces, the land lying higher. Excepting some part of what is called the Veluwe, the soil is good and fruitful. The county of Zutphen, in particular, yields great quantities of apples, pears, and cherries; nor is it without meadows and arable lands, though the soil in general is heathy. Gelderland is watered by the Rhine, and its three branches, the Waal, the Yssel, and the Leck, besides lesser streams. In 1079, it was raised to a county by the emperor Henry IV.
<PB N="462" REF="4660"/>
and in 1339 to a duchy, by the emperor Lewis of Bavaria. It had dukes of its own till 1528, when it was yielded up to the emperor Charles V. That part of it which at present constitutes the province of Gelderland, acceded, in 1579, to the union of Utrecht. It is divided into three districts, each of which has its states and diets. Those for the whole province are held twice a-year, at the capital towns. The deputies sent by the province to the states-general are nineteen. As to religion, here are two hundred and eighty-five Calvinist ministers, fourteen Roman catholic con∣gregations, and four Lutheran, besides three others of remonstrants and anabaptists. The places of most note in the province are,</P>
<P>Nemmeguen, in Latin Noviomagum, which stands on the Waal, nine miles from Cleves, and fifty-two from Amsterdam, and is the capital of the quarter to which it gives name. It is a large an∣tient city, strongly fortified, and pleasantly situated, where the Oppidum Batavorum is supposed by some to have stood. It was formerly an impe∣rial and hanse town. On the east side of it stands an old castle, called the Falkenhof, where are pleasant walks of lime-trees, and it contains several churches, belonging to different sects. The provincial states, and those of the district, assemble in the stadthouse. This city is famous for the peace concluded here, in 1678, between the French and the confederates. It carries on a good trade with the duchy of Cleves, and makes great profit by its white beer, which is much esteemed through∣out the provinces. In the town-house is kept the sword with which the counts Egmont and Horn were beheaded by the duke of Alva's order. The burgrave, who resides in the castle, is one of the chief nobles of the province, and pre∣sides in its diets.</P>
<P><PB N="463" REF="4670"/>
Tiel or Thiel, a town on the Waal, seventeen miles from Nemeguen, to the west. Tho' much fallen from what it was formerly, yet it is still pretty well inhabited, and has a tolerable trade, by means of the Waal and Maes.</P>
<P>Bommel or Salt Bommel, a town on an island in the Waal, called, from the town, Bommelwaard.</P>
<P>Batenburg, a country town on the Maes, having a stately castle, which, with the town, belongs to the counts of Bentheim-Steinfurt.</P>
<P>Panderen, a village in the bailiage of Upper-Be∣tuwe, where begins the new canal, through which the Rhine at present passes. In the same bailiage stood formerly the Schenken-Schanze, a very strong and spacious fort, built, in 1586, by general Martin Schenk; and the Tolhaus, a castle where the dukes of Gelderland frequently resided, and where vessels still pay toll, as they did formerly. The Betuwe is that tract of land lying between the Rhine and the Waal. It is divided into two bailiages, called the Upper and Lower, or Eastern and Western Be∣tuwe.</P>
<P>Zutphen, a town on the right bank of the Yssel, giving name to a county, which constitutes ano∣ther of the three quarters into which the province is divided. The town is large and strongly forti∣fied, and has a bridge of boats over the Yssel, which divides the town into two parts. The whole neighbouring country may be laid under water by means of the Borkel, a river which here joins the Yssel. There are several churches here, belonging to different sects; with hospitals for the aged, sick, orphans, and strangers; and a gymna∣sium. The town was formerly one of the Hanse, and more flourishing than at present. There are pleasant walks about it, especially on the ramparts. The citizens are noted for their courtesy and po∣liteness, to which the many gentlemen who
<PB N="464" REF="4680"/>
live here greatly contribute. Gerard van Zutphen, master to the famous Thomas á Kempis, and other learned men, were born in this city: and the great Sir Philip Sidney died of the wounds he received at the siege thereof. Its name, in the Dutch, sig∣nifies the South Fen.</P>
<P>Doesburg, a small but well fortified town, at the conflux of the Old and New Yssel, the latter of which is the canal cut by Drusus to bring the Rhine into the Old Yssel. This town stands six miles from Zutphen, and, by some, is supposed to derive its name from Drusus. A great deal of tobacco grows in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Deutichem, a small town on the Old Yssel. Here great quantities of bombs, bullets, and gra∣nadoes, are cast out of iron dug in this county.</P>
<P>Lochem, a small open town on the Borkel.</P>
<P>Grol, a small open town, on a branch of the Borkel named the Slink, near the borders of the bishopric of Munster, fifteen miles from Zutphen. It is a great thoroughfare for waggons, laden with goods from Germany, which pay toll at this place.</P>
<P>Borkelo, a small town on the Borkel, giving name to a lordship which had once lords of its own, and occasioned the war betwixt the states and the bishop of Munster, in 1665 and 1672, the latter claiming a right to it, upon the failure of the male issue of its lords.</P>
<P>Breedevoort, a small but well fortified town, near the borders of the bishopric of Munster, be∣longing to the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>Heerenberg, a small town, which gives name to a lordship belonging to the prince of Hohen∣zollern-Sigmaringen.</P>
<P>Arnheim or Arnem, which gives name to the third quarter, and is the capital not only of that, but of the whole province. It stands on the Rhine,
<PB N="465" REF="4690"/>
at the foot of the Veluwe hills, six miles from Ni∣meguen, and forty-eight from Amsterdam, and is strongly fortified. It has also a commodious har∣bour, and is the seat of the supreme council of Gelderland, and the chamber of accounts. Here is an antient palace, in which the dukes of Gelder∣land, and after them the stadtholders of the pro∣vince, used to keep their court. The walls, being delightfully planted with lime-trees, make a plea∣sant walk. In the great church are the monu∣ments of several counts and dukes of Gelder∣land; and near the city is the village of Ooster∣beck, where the emperor Henry III. was born, in 1027.</P>
<P>Harderwyk, situate on the Zuyder-see, twenty-six miles from Arnheim, and thirty from Amster∣dam. Here is an university, which, till 1648, was only a Schola illustris. The trade of the town is considerable, especially in fish, of which its red herrings are much admired. The steeple of St. Mary's church, a most stately structure, is so high that it serves for a land-mark, being seen at a great distance, both by sea and land. Prodigious quan∣tities of blue-berries are gathered in the neighbour∣ing woods, and carried to Amsterdam, and other towns. The provincial mint is in this city, the for∣tifications of which are in the antient manner. The famous lawyer Gerardus Voetius is said to have been a native of this place.</P>
<P>Wageningen, a small town on the Rhine, with a commodious harbour. In the neighbourhood to∣bacco is much cultivated.</P>
<P>Elburg, a small town on the Zuyder-see, whose ramparts, planted with lime trees, form a delight∣ful walk. Its inhabitants subsist chiefly by fishing, and catching wild-ducks.</P>
<P>In that tract of land called the Veluwe is the lordship of Loo, belonging, with a beautiful seat
<PB N="466" REF="4700"/>
on it, to the prince of Orange. In the same di∣strict, at the village of Dieren, is another seat be∣longing to the prince. Between the Nimmegen quar∣ter and the provinces of Holland and Utrecht, lie the counties of Buren and Kuilenburg, which are also the property of the prince of Orange, and take their names from two small towns in them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which is the largest of the seven, is divided into South and North Holland, the lat∣ter of which is also called West Friesland; and bounded on the west by the German ocean, or North Sea; to the east by the Zuyder-see, the pro∣vince of Utrecht, and part of Gelderland; to the south by Dutch Brabant and Zealand; and to the north by the Zuyder-see. Its greatest extent from north to south, including the island of Texel, is about ninety English miles; but from east to west its extent varies from forty to twenty-five. To defend it against the sea, dykes have been erected at an immense expence, and innumerable cana's cut to drain it, as being naturally very low and marshy. Some parts of the province are very fruitful in corn; but the greater part consists of rich pastures, wherein are kept large herds of kine, which supply them with incredible quanti∣ties of butter and cheese. Of the latter, that of Edam, in North Holland, is highly esteemed. The many rivers and canals that intersect the pro∣vince are of great advantage to its commerce, but contribute to render the air foggy and unwhole∣some. There is a communication by water be∣twixt almost every town and village. Towards the middle also of the province are great numbers of turf pits. It is so populous, that the number
<PB N="467" REF="4710"/>
of the inhabitants is computed at one million two hundred thousand. In point of cleanliness, no country surpasses, and few come up to it, especially in North Holland, and that even in the villages. From the counts of Holland this province de∣volved, in 1436, to the dukes of Burgundy, and from them to the house of Austria, along with the other provinces. The states of Holland and West Friesland are composed of the nobility and depu∣ties of the towns: of the latter there are eighteen that send deputies to the assembly of the states, which is held at the Hague. The grand pensionary is a person of great dignity and weight in this as∣sembly, and his office requires extraordinary abilities. There are also two councils composed of deputies, one for South, and another for North Holland, who have the cognizance of the revenue and military affairs. The whole province sends one deputy from among the noblesse to the states-general, who takes precedence of all others, together with three or four more. There are two supreme courts of ju∣dicature for Holland and Zealand, viz. the great council of Holland and Zealand, and the hof, or court of Holland. To these appeals lie from the towns; but the causes of noblemen come before them in the first instance. With respect to the ecclesiastical government, there is a synod held annually both in South and North Holland, of which the former contains eleven classes, and the latter six; and the ministers of both together amount to three hundred and thirty-one. In the whole province are thirty-seven towns, eight bo∣roughs, and four hundred villages, of which the most considerable in South Holland, taking them according to their rank, are,</P>
<P>Dort, which stands nine miles from Rotterdam, and thirty-four from Amsterdam, on an island that was formed by the overflowing of the Maes and
<PB N="468" REF="4720"/>
Merwe, in 1421. It is so strong by nature, that it has little or no need of art. Here is the mint for South Holland, a gymnasium, a commodious harbour, and a considerable trade, especially in grain, linen, thread, Rhenish wine, and timber, the two last of which are brought down the Rhine from Germany. The apartment in the Guildhall, in which the famous synod which condemned the Arminians in 1618 and 19, was held, is still shewn to strangers. Here the counts of Holland for∣merly had their usual residence.</P>
<P>Harlem, situate on the river Sparen, not far from the lake to which it gives name. It is a large, populous, and pleasant city, ten miles from Amsterdam to the west, and fourteen from Leyden towards the north. The papists here far out-num∣ber the protestants. Vast quantities of linen and thread are bleached here, the waters of the lake having a particular quality that renders them very fit for that purpose; but neither the manufactures of silk, cloth, or linen, are in so flourishing a condition as formerly. This city, as is well known, claims the honour of the invention of printing, which some think more justly due to John Gotten∣berg of Mentz. The magistrates keep in their town-house the first book printed by Coster, about the year 1440. Before the Reformation Har∣lem was a bishop's see. It is famous for the siege which it held out against the Spaniards for ten months in 1573; the townsmen, before they capi∣tulated, were reduced to eat leather, grass, and the vilest animals. They kept a correspondence with the prince of Orange, for a considerable time, by means of carrier pigeons. There is a com∣munication with the lake, and with Amster∣dam and Leyden, by means of several canals. Schemes have been often formed for draining the lake, but never put in execution. To the south of the town lies a wood, cut into delightful walks
<PB N="469" REF="4730"/>
and vistas. A sort of phrensy in regard to flowers, particularly tulips, once prevailed here, in conse∣quence of which the most beautiful sorts were bought and sold at an extravagant price. The aca∣demy of sciences was founded at Harlem in 1752.</P>
<P>Delft, a large, handsome, stately city, four miles from the Hague, towards the south-east. There is little stir here, the city being chiefly inha∣bited by rich people, who have retired from busi∣ness. In the great church is a magnificent mauso∣leum, erected in 1609, at the expence of the states-general, to the memory of William I. prince of Orange, who was basely assassinated by an emis∣sary of Philip II. king of Spain. At the feet of the prince's statue lies a dog, who is said to have died of grief when his master was murdered. Among other stately monuments in the old church is that of the renowned admiral Van Tromp. Delft is famous for its fine earthen ware made in imitation of china, and known by the name of Delft ware. The town house is adorned with several statues, as those of Justice, Prudence, and Mercy, and over the gate is this distich:</P>
<Q>Haec domus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat, Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.</Q>
<P>i. e.</P>
<Q>This house hates wickedness, loves peace, punishes crimes, preserves the laws, and honours the good.</Q>
<P>Here, as in most of the other towns of the pro∣vinces, are chimes, extremely harmonious: they play one tune at the first quarter after every hour, two at the next, three at the next, and four before the hour strikes. The arsenal for the province of Holland, together with two powder-magazines for the same province, and two for the Generalité, are kept here. Here also lie the yachts, which bring
<PB N="470" REF="4740"/>
the deputies of the several provinces to the assem∣blies at the Hague. These yachts are exquisitely beautiful and rich, the provinces and cities vying with each other which shall have the best accom∣modation for their representatives. They are from thirty to fifty tons burthen, being adorned with streamers, and carrying guns, with trumpets, and other music. To this town belongs Delfshaven, a beautiful village on the Maes, about eight miles from Delft, to the south-east. It is a flourishing place, having a good harbour, in which lie the East-India ships, and herring-busses, with other vessels be∣longing to the merchants of Delft.</P>
<P>Leyden, in Latin, Lugdunum Batavorum, one of the largest and finest cities in Holland, abounds with canals, along which are rows of lofty trees, that afford very pleasant walks. An arm, or small branch of the Rhine, runs through it. Over the canals are one hundred and forty-five bridges, most of them of stone or brick. The university here is the oldest in the United-Provinces: it has large privi∣leges, a library well furnished, and particularly rich in manuscripts, a physic garden well stocked with all sorts of plants, many of which have been brought from the Cape of Good Hope and the East-Indies, an anatomy-hall, well provided with skeletons, and an observatory. The professors, who are ge∣nerally very eminent, read public lectures four times a week, for which they take no money; but about three guineas are paid for a course of private lectures, which lasts a whole year. The students have no distinct habit, but all wear swords, though they generally go to the public and private lectures in their night-gowns and slippers. The salaries of the professors are from one hundred to two hundred pounds a-year: they wear gowns only when they preside at public disputations, read public lectures, or meet in the senate; and their lectures are always
<PB N="471" REF="4750"/>
in Latin. The students do not lodge in the uni∣versity, but where they please in the town. The cloth manufacture here is much decayed, which formerly flourished to such a degree, that one hun∣dred thousand pieces, it is said, have sometimes been made in a year. The city is famous for the long and severe siege it maintained in 1573 against the Spaniards. We cannot help mentioning the reply of that illustrious magistrate, Adrian de Verf, when the citizens represented to him the havock made by the famine during the siege, and insisted upon his surrendering: "Friends, said he, here is my body, divide it among you, to satisfy your hunger, but banish all thoughts of sur∣rendering to the cruel and perfidious Spaniard." They took his advice, in regard to their not sur∣rendering, and never would listen to any overtures; but told the Spaniards, they would hold out as long as they had an arm to eat, and another to fight. There are some fine churches here, and many long, broad, handsome streets; but the papists, as at Harlem, are more numerous than the protestants.</P>
<P>Amsterdam, or Amsteldam, derives its name from the Amstel, on which it is situated, and the dam, or dyke, built there, to prevent the inunda∣tion of the river. It is the first city in the pro∣vinces in point of trade, extent, and wealth, though not in rank. The Amstel divides it into two parts, and fills its fine canals, before it joins the Y, which is an arm of the Zuyder, or South-sea, that almost entirely divides South from North-Holland. The soil being marshy, the buildings are founded upon oaken piles, or stakes, driven at a great expence, into the ground. The canals, which are very nume∣rous, divide the town into a multitude of islands, which are joined again by a vast number of bridges. The ships lying in the Yare in such numbers, that their masts look like a forest. Amsterdam stands
<PB N="472" REF="4760"/>
ten miles from Harlem, twenty from Leyden, twenty-eight from the Hague, and twenty-nine from Rotterdam. In the thirteenth century it was only a small fishing town; it now appears in the form of a crescent, or half-moon, on the Y, and is well fortified on the land-side with ramparts and bastions. On each of the latter is a windmill, besides a vast number of others, all round the town. The gates of the city are very fine, especially that of Harlem. On the side next the Y, it is defend∣ed by a double row of piles driven into the water, with openings for ships to pass in and out; the lesser lying within, and the greater without the piles, and some even between them. The Plan∣tagie is a place laid out into beautiful walks, and planted with trees. On the Y is also a very de∣lightful walk, commanding a fine prospect. A∣mong the public buildings most deserving the at∣tention of a traveller, is the stadthouse, which stands in a large square on the Damme, and cost the city above thirty millions of guilders. It is admi∣rably adorned with marble, sculpture, statues, painting, and guilding. Underneath are prisons for criminals, and large apartments, where the treasures of the famous bank are kept. Here also the assemblies of the senate are held, and causes, both civil and criminal, are tried, and, in general, all public business transacted. The chimes of the tower are extremely fine, and it commands a de∣lightful prospect of the city and its environs, as far as the Zuyder-see. The exchange too is worth view∣ing, as well as the arsenal; the inn called The Three Waggons, the gymnasium illustre, the East and West India houses, the lombard and loan bank, the theatre, the physic-garden, the chirurgical and anatomical college, the naval store-houses, the docks, sluices, churches, hospitals, houses of cor∣rection, harbour, towers, warehouses, weighing-houses,
<PB N="473" REF="4770"/>
&amp;c. The lombard is a corporation em∣powered by authority to lend money upon pledges at a moderate interest. When the sum wanted and the pawn are considerable, as in the case of the elector of Bavaria's jewels, it is thought the bank both advances the money, and receives the interest. The bank here was founded in 1609. All payments, exceeding the sum of three hundred guilders, must be made in bank. Bank money is generally about five per cent. better than current, and the difference is termed the agio. Instead of drawing an interest, every proprietor pays consi∣derably for keeping his money in the bank, the credit of which is very great, as depending not so much upon the treasure actually deposited there, as upon the security of the city, and even of the republic: but it is said to be a mistake, that the whole business of this bank is managed by trans∣fer, and no money ever issued. It is under the care and inspection of the burgomasters. As to the trade of this city let it suffice to say, that it has a great share not only of that carried on in Europe, but in all the rest of the world; and in particular, that it is in possession of one half of that vast com∣merce carried on by the Dutch to the East-Indies, and governs the whole. The industry of the inha∣bitants of Amsterdam is amazing; all are employ∣ed in some trade, manufactures, or business, and none are idle, but such as either want hands, or strength to use them. The number of inhabitants is computed at about two hundred thousand, of which a great part are papists and Jews. The number of foreigners here is also generally very considerable. The greatest disadvantages this city labours under is the want of good air and water, and perhaps conversation. At the mouth of the harbour is a bar, which cannot be passed by large ships, till they are lightened.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4780"/>
Gauda, commonly called Ter-Gow, is seated on the small river Gow, from which it has its name, and which falls into the Yssel below the town, about twenty-three miles from Amsterdam to∣wards the south-east. The inhabitants, by their sluices, can lay the adjacent country all under water. The paintings on the windows of the church of St. John the Baptist are said to be the finest, of that kind, in the world; they consist of several pieces both of sacred and profane history. The trade of this place, at present, is chiefly in cordage, thread, and tobacco pipes, in the last of which they sur∣pass all others; but the clay is brought from the bishopric of Liege. Vast quantities of bricks and tiles are also made in the neighbourhood of the town; and most of the barks employed in the trade between Holland, Zealand, and the Au∣strian Netherlands, pass through it. The gene∣rality of the inhabitants, however, are said to be such as have quitted business, to spend the remain∣der of their days in peace and retirement. The archives of Holland are kept here.</P>
<P>Rotterdam, standing at the conflux of the Maes, or Merwe, and the Rotter, from the latter of which, and Dam, its name is formed. It is thirteen miles from the Hague, twenty-eight from Amsterdam, and fifteen from Leyden; and, next to the two last, it is said to be now the greatest city in Hol∣land. Its streets are spacious, adorned with lofty trees, and noble canals; by the last of which ships of the greatest burden run into the heart of the city, and lade and unlade at the merchants doors. The trade here is very great, especially to Eng∣land and Scotland. Over the Maes, which is here very broad, is a bridge, on which is placed a brass statue of Erasmus. The Haaring-Vliet, and the Boom-quay, are very fine streets. The latter lies along the Maes, and on one side has a magnificent
<PB N="475" REF="4790"/>
row of trees and houses, or rather palaces, extend∣ing above half a mile; and on the other the river, where ships are continually sailing up and down, or at anchor. This charming key, being very broad and clean, serves instead of a mall. The principal buildings in the town are the exchange, the East and West-India houses, the bank, the ar∣senal, and the great church, or that of St. Laurence, near which is the little obscure house in which Erasmus was born, with his picture, and this distich over the door:</P>
<Q>Aedibus his ortus, mundum d coravit Erasmus, Artibus ingenuis, religione, fide.</Q>
<P>i. e.</P>
<Q>Erasmus, who adorned the world with arts and sciences, religion and virtue, was born in this house.</Q>
<P>There are three high tribunals in this city, viz. that of the admiralty of the Maes; of the high-bailiff, or dyke-graaf of Schieland; and that of the judges of Schieland. On the east and west sides of the city are docks, where they are continually build∣ing, repairing, or launching vessels; but the largest ships belonging to the admiralty of Rotterdam lie at Helvoetsluys; and, as there is not a sufficient depth of water at the mouth of the Maes for ships that draw above fifteen feet, they are obliged to come hither by the way of Helvoetsluys, and the Haaring Vliet. The glass-house here makes a∣bundance of glass-toys, and enamelled bowls, which are sent to India, and exchanged for China ware, and other oriental commodities.</P>
<P>Gorkum, situated at the conflux of the Merwe and Linge, on the frontiers of Gelderland, car∣ries on a good trade in corn and salmon, (the latter of which is taken in the Merwe) and in but∣ter,
<PB N="476" REF="4800"/>
cheese, poultry, and wild-ducks, brought down the Linge from Gelderland. From the steeple of the church may be seen twenty-two walled towns, with a vast number of villages. It is a neat well built city, and, being one of the keys of Holland, is strongly fortified, especially on the side next Gel∣derland, as on the others the country may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Schiedam, so called from its situation on the Schie, which a little lower falls into the Maes. It is a small but populous city, and the third in rank among the small cities that send deputies to the provincial states. In its neighbourhood grow great numbers of juniper trees. The inhabitants sub∣sist chiefly by the herring fishery, and by making nets.</P>
<P>Schoonhoven, at the conflux of the Leck and Vliet, about eleven miles from Rotterdam. It is well fortified, has a good harbour, and trade, especially in salmon, paper, and herrings. The adjacent country may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Briel, situated in the island of Voorn, on the left-side, and near the mouth of the Maes. It has a good harbour and trade, and is strongly for∣tified. Here the famous admiral Tromp was born. On the ramparts are pleasant walks of trees. The island, in which it stands, is fruitful in corn, but the air is too moist. It is the last of the towns in South-Holland that send deputies to the states; and one of those that, in 1585, was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth. Of the other towns, the prin∣cipal are,</P>
<P>The Hague, in Latin Haga Comitis, in French La Haye, in Dutch der Haag, or 'S-Graavenhage, i. e. the Earl's Grove or Wood, from the wood near which it is built, and in which the earls of Holland had a country-house. Though it sends no deputies to the states, it is one of the most con∣siderable
<PB N="477" REF="4810"/>
towns in Holland, pleasantly situated, and exceeding beautiful. The inhabitants also breathe a better air than those of the other cities, as it stands on a dry soil, somewhat higher than the rest of the country. It has no gates or walls, but is surrounded by a moat, over which there are many draw-bridges. Two hours are required to walk round it, and it contains about forty or fifty thou∣sand souls. It is a place of much splendor and bu∣siness, being the seat of the high colleges of the republic and province of Holland, and the resi∣dence of the stadtholder, and foreign ambassadors; and there are a great many fine streets and squares in it. In the Inner-Court all the high colleges and courts of justice hold their assemblies: there also the foot-guards do duty, as the horse-guards do in the Outer, when the states are sitting. De Plaats is an open airy place, in form of a triangle, adorn∣ed with neat and beautiful buildings: the Vyver-berg is an eminence, laid out into several fine shady walks, with the Vyver, a large bason of water, at the bottom: the Voorhout is the most celebrated part of the Hague, and consists of the mall, and three ways for coaches on each side, planted with trees, being much the same as St. James's park at London: the palace of Opdam, or Wassenaar, is built in a very elegant taste: the Prince and Princess Grafts are fine streets: the Plain, in Dutch Het Pleyn, is a beautiful grove, laid out in several cross walks, and surrounded with stately houses: the Jewish synagogue is well worth being seen by a curious traveller; and also the palaces of the prince of Orange, the Hotel of Spain, the New Voor∣hout, the mausoleum of the baron of Opdam in the great church, and the several hospitals. The environs of the Hague are exceeding pleasant. Among other agreeable objects are the wood, with the palace of Orange at the extremity of it,

called the House in the Wood; the village of Scheveling; and the sand hills along the North Sea; with the village of Voorburg, and the charming seats and fine gardens round it. Two miles from the Hauge is Ryswick, a village; and, a quarter of a mile from that, a noble palace belonging to the prince of Orange, famous for the treaty of peace concluded there in 1697. Loosduynen, where Margaret, countess of Henneburg, and daughter of Florence IV. count of Holland and Zealand, is said to have been delivered of three hundred and sixty-five children at a birth, in 1276, is about five miles from the Hague. Five miles beyond Loosduynen, and not far from the beauti∣ful village of Gravesande, is Honslardyck, another palace belonging to the prince of Orange, and one of the finest structures in the Low-Countries.</P>
<P>Naorden, a town on the Zuyder-see, strongly for∣tified, and a kind of a barrier to Amsterdam. Here are some woollen and velvet manufactories.</P>
<P>Muyden, a well fortified town at the mouth of the Vecht, on the Zuyder-see. Great quantities of salt are made here; and the adjacent country, in case of need, may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Wezep, the chief business of whose inhabitants is to carry fresh water from the Vecht to Amster∣dam; Nieuwersluice, on the Vecht; Woerden, on the Old Rhine; Oudewater; Nieuwpoort on the Leck, Gertruydenberg, and Der-Klundert, belong∣ing to the house of Nassau; Helvoetsluys, which has a small, but commodious harbour, where the packet boat from England usually arrives; Goree, on an island of the same name; Vianen, on the Leck; Williamstadt, on the frontiers of Dutch Bra∣bant; Workham; Heusden; Vlaardingen, a pretty large place, from which more busses go, one year with another, to the herring fishery, than from all the other ports of the Netherlands put together;

and Catwyk-op-Zee, where is a most stately seat belonging to the Wassenaar family. Near the last stood formerly the Arx Britannica, a fort or castle, said to have been erected by the emperor Caligula.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are still some other small towns and forts, and a great number of villages, superior to many towns, in other countries, in trade, wealth, extent, and beauty. Among the forts is Lovestein, on the borders of Gelderland, in which the celebrated Grotius was confined, in 1619.</P>
