<HEAD>ISAIAH, Chapter XIV. Verse 4.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. — HOW hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!</P>
<P N="5">5. The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.</P>
<P N="6">6. He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted and none hindereth.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="22" REF="21"/>7. The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.</P>
<P N="8">8. Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.</P>
<P N="9">9. Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</P>
<P N="10">10. All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="24" REF="23"/>11. Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</P>
<P N="12">12. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!</P>
<P N="13">13. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:</P>
<P N="14">14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.</P>
<P N="15">15. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.</P>
<P N="16">16. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying,</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms?</P>
<P N="17">17. That made the world as a wilderness, and destroy∣ed the cities thereof, that opened not the house of his prisoners?</P>
<P N="18">18. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.</P>
<P N="19">19. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abomin∣ble branch; and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase troden under feet.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="28" REF="27"/>20. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned.</P>
<P N="21">21. Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.</P>
<P N="22">22. For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son and nephew, saith the Lord.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="30" REF="29"/>23. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts.</P>
<P N="24">24. The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:</P>
<P N="25">25. That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.</P>
<P N="26">26. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.</P>
<P N="27">27. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?</P>
