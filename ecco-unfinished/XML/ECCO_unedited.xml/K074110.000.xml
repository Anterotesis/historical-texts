<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following <HI>Essay</HI>
had occasion, in writing on <HI>Taste,</HI>
to consider its connexion with <HI>Genius.</HI>
The attention which he bestowed on this
latter faculty, in that one point of view,
convinced him, that its Nature and its
Principles admitted and required a fuller
investigation than had ever been at∣tempted,
and determined him to enter
on that investigation immediately after
finishing his former work. Accordingly
his plan was formed, the first part com∣posed,
and some progress made in the
second part, so long ago as the year
1758. He was then in an office which
favoured enquiries of this nature; his
continuance in it would have afforded
him the opportunity of compleating the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
design in a short time; and the indul∣gent
reception given by the Public to his
<HI>Essay on Taste</HI> would have encouraged
him to it: but being soon after removed
to an office which necessarily directed
his chief attention to subjects of a dif∣ferent
kind, and fully occupied his time,
he has been able to prosecute his de∣sign,
with long and frequent interrup∣tions,
only as the immediate duties of
his profession allowed him leisure. In∣tervals
of such leisure have put it in his
power to reduce his thoughts to the form
in which they now appear. The <HI>subject</HI>
is curious; of the <HI>execution</HI> the Public
are the proper judges.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarked by those who have consi∣dered
the state of human knowlege with
greatest attention, that the subjects of
men's enquiries have been, in most cases, de∣termined
by accident, and not pursued with
regular application, according to their dignity
or their natural connexion. On this account,
some subjects of the greatest importance have
been totally neglected, and many more have
been imperfectly examined, and prosecuted
no farther than superficial observations spon∣taneously
occurred, and casual inclination dis∣posed
men to attend to them. This has hap∣pened
in all the sciences, but especially in the
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
science of human nature. It has seldom
been explored with that care which is requi∣site
in a subject so subtile and abstruse. Far
from taking a complete survey of this curious
region, men have satisfied themselves with
some random incursions, visiting only a few
tracts which happened to engage their curio∣sity,
and penetrating even into these, only so
far as some present view required.</P>
<P>ALL the same causes which produce such a
superficial and fortuitous method of investiga∣tion
with regard to other subjects, produce it
likewise with regard to the human mind:
and some circumstances render our enquiries
on this subject, slight and accidental, which
do not extend their influence to the others.
The phenomena of the mind have not so great
steddiness of existence, as the qualities of bo∣dies.
It is impossible to make experiments so
purposely on the understanding or the pas∣sions,
to pursue them so deliberately, or to
repeat them so easily, as on material things.
It is necessary to catch appearances as they
happen to discover themselves, either imme∣diately
to a man's own consciousness, or by
their effects in the conduct or conversation of
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
other men. For this reason it requires long
time, favourable opportunities, and incessant
attention, to collect such a number of facts
concerning any of the mental powers, as will
be sufficient for deducing conclusions concern∣ing
them, by a just and regular induction.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty which attends the investiga∣tion
of the principles of human nature, has
contributed much to check the progress of
men's enquiries concerning them, and to pre∣vent
some of the most important of them from
being at all professedly analysed. Genius
itself, the leading faculty of the mind, the
grand instrument of all investigation, has
scarce ever been examined with care. In the
writings of those who treat with greatest ac∣curacy
of the intellectual powers, we find
only a few incidental observations concerning
Genius. It is confessed to be a subject of ca∣pital
importance, without the knowlege of
which a regular method of invention cannot
be established, and useful discoveries must
continue to be made, as they have generally
been made hitherto, merely by chance. But
it is reckoned a subject which can be reduced
to no fixt or general principles; its phenome∣na
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
are almost universally regarded as anoma∣lous
and inexplicable. It is however worth
while to enquire, whether this be really the
ease, and to make an attempt at least, to ex∣plain
the nature and varieties of Genius from
the simple qualities of the human mind.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nature of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be proper to begin our enquiries,
by ascertaining, what it is that properly
constitutes Genius as distinguished from our
other intellectual powers. This will both
render our conception of it precise, and lead
us to discover, what other operations of the
understanding, attend it in its exertions, or
assist it, and in what manner.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Province and Criterion of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE powers of the human mind, how∣ever
distinct in themselves, are gene∣rally
complicated in their energies. Scarce
any of them can be exerted in perfection,
without the assistance of many others. On
this account, it is very difficult to collect the
phenomena which belong to each, to distin∣guish
precisely one faculty from the rest, and
to ascertain its peculiar nature and province.
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
The habit of confounding our mental powers
with one another, is so strong as to render the
closest attention necessary for making a sepa∣ration;
and the natural subtlety of the sub∣ject
makes it hard to reflect upon it with close
attention. But without determining, in this
manner, the proper nature of each faculty,
and marking its real difference from those
which most resemble it and are often combin∣ed
with it, our conception of it will be im∣perfect
and indeterminate.</P>
<P>THE exertions of Genius can never be com∣plete
or regular, when any of the intellectual
powers is remarkably defective. It receives
assistance from them all. But Genius is not∣withstanding
<HI>one</HI> of the intellectual powers,
and distinguishable from the rest. There are
many productions which are far from satisfy∣ing
reason, or altogether approving themselves
to taste, in which we yet acknowlege conspi∣cuous
marks of real genius. Their faults
discover a defect, not of this, but of some
other power. Few competent judges will
now-a-days assert that the dialectics of Aris∣totle,
are of any considerable utility for the
end which he proposed to answer by them,
the discovery of truth: but that work, per∣haps
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
more than any other of his works, dis∣plays
the compass of his genius. It will be
generally allowed that the writings of Shake∣spear
have almost as great faults as beauties;
but it will be as generally asserted, that his
genius is so original and immense as to place
him at the head of modern poets. What then
is the precise criterion of genius? If we can
determine what it is, we shall the more easily
form a distinct conception of the nature of
this faculty.</P>
<P>THE difficulty in determining the province
of genius, which arises from the natural in∣tricacy
and mutual connexion of the intellec∣tual
powers, is increased by the confused ap∣plication
of names, to which that has given
occasion. Genius is confounded, not only by
the vulgar, but even sometimes by judicious
writers, with mere capacity. Nothing how∣ever
is more evident, than that they are to∣tally
distinct. A capacity of learning, is very
general among mankind. As birds are by
nature made fit for flying, a horse for the
course, or a wild beast for fierceness, so doci∣lity
is congenial to man. A human creature
in every respect unteachable, were one of the
greatest and rarest of monsters. Most chil∣dren
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
promise some abilities, though the want
of culture and other causes often blast them,
and frustrate the kind intentions of Nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sicut aves ad volatum, equi ad cursum, ad saevitiam ferae gignuntur: ita nobis propria est mentis agitatio, atque solertia.—Hebetes vero et indociles non magis secundum na∣turam hominis eduntur, quam prodigiosa corpora, et monstris insignia: sed hi pauci admodum. Fuerit argumentum, quod in pueris clucet spes plurimorum: quae cum emoritur aetate, manifestum est non naturam defecisse, sed curam. QUINTIL. <HI>Institut. Orat.</HI> lib. i. cap. 1.</NOTE>.
Mere capacity, in most subjects, implies no∣thing
beyond a little judgment, a tolerable
memory, and considerable industry. But true
genius is very different, and much less fre∣quent.</P>
<P>GENIUS is properly the faculty of <HI>inven∣tion;</HI>
by means of which a man is qualified
for making new discoveries in science, or for
producing original works of art. We may
ascribe taste, judgment, or knowlege, to a
man who is incapable of invention; but we
cannot reckon him a man of genius. In order
to determine, how far he merits this charac∣ter,
we must enquire, whether he has disco∣vered
any new principle in science, or invent∣ed
any new art, or carried those arts which
are already practised, to a higher degree of
perfection, than former masters? Or, whe∣ther,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
at least, he has, in matters of science,
improved on the discoveries of his predeces∣sors,
and reduced principles formerly known,
to a greater degree of simplicity and consist∣ence,
or traced them through a train of con∣sequences
hitherto unknown? Or, in the
arts, designed some new work, different from
those of his predecessors, though not perhaps
excelling them? Whatever falls short of
this, is servile imitation, or a dull effort of
plodding industry, which, as not implying in∣vention,
can be deemed no proof of genius,
whatever capacity, skill, or diligence it may
evidence. But if a man shows invention, no
intellectual defects which his performance
may betray, can forfeit his claim to genius.
His invention may be irregular, wild, undis∣ciplined;
but still it is regarded as an infalli∣ble
mark of real natural genius: and the <HI>de∣gree</HI>
of this faculty, that we ascribe to him,
is always in proportion to our estimate of the
novelty, the difficulty, or the dignity of his
inventions.</P>
<P>THESE observations, when barely mention∣ed,
are so agreeable to our natural sentiments,
that a long illustration of them would be su∣perfluous.
They would be amply confirmed
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
by an examination of the characters of those
whom the voice of all ages has pronounced
most eminent for genius, and of the particu∣lar
grounds on which this eminence has been
assigned them. But a few examples shall
suffice in so clear a case.</P>
<P>ALL the ancients who are most celebrated
for genius in the greater kinds of poetry, ei∣ther
invented some new species, or brought a
species already invented, to higher perfection;
or at least produced compositions distinguished
from those of others, by a diversity of sub∣ject,
or by a peculiar and original manner.
Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, not only
composed several tragedies, by which they
displayed invention, in the contrivance of the
fable, in imagining incidents, in forming cha∣racters,
in conceiving sentiments adapted to
them; but each of them made some consider∣able
improvements in the construction of the
drama<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Tragedias <HI>primus</HI> in lucem Aeschylus protulit.—Sed <HI>longe clarius</HI> illustraverunt hoe opus Sophocles atque Euripides. QUINTIL. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 1.

<L>Et docuit magnamque loqui, nitique cothurno.</L></Q>
HOR. <HI>Ars Poet.</HI> ver. 278.</NOTE>. The genius of Homer has been
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
always held in veneration. His Iliad, his
Odyssey, and even his more trivial produc∣tions,
display so much of rich and original
invention in almost every possible way, as
would have secured to the author an acknow∣legement
of very uncommon genius, though
he had lived in the most enlightened age, and
possessed all advantages for improving his
natural talents. But our idea of his inven∣tion
is immensely raised, when we consider,
that he lived in times of ignorance, when
poetry remained almost in its first rudeness;
that he had no model, by which he could di∣rect
his conceptions, or from which he could
receive so much as a hint of his grand de∣signs;
and that he notwithstanding, merely
by the force of his own abilities, brought the
noblest species of poetry all at once to its just
perfection, and comprehended also in his works,
the rudiments of every other species of com∣position,
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
the seeds from which, in Aristotle's
judgment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, succeeding writers reared both
tragedy and comedy, and from which, in the
opinion of Quintilian<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hic (quemadmodum ex oceano dicit ipse amnium vim, fontiumque cursus initium capere) omnibus eloquentiae parti∣bus exemplum et <HI>ortum</HI> dedit. <HI>Instit. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 1.</NOTE>, even orators might
produce all the virtues of their art. On ac∣count
of original and extensive invention,
thus amazingly displayed, his title to the first
rank of genius, has been acknowleged by all
capable and impartial judges. The Eneid is
perhaps more correct and faultless than the
Iliad; but few have pretended that Virgil is
the greater poet. He does not show such co∣pious
and boundless invention, as his master.
Besides, Virgil derives from imitation, many
things for which Homer is indebted solely to
his own penetration. Were we to compare
the Eneid with Paradise Lost, merely in re∣spect
of the genius which they manifest, we
might justly prefer Milton to Virgil. For
though we know that Milton was perfectly
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
well acquainted both with the Mantuan and
with Homer, had the works of both in his
eye, and scrupled not to imitate them; yet
the nature of his plan, and the peculiarity of
many of the incidents and characters in his
poem, require greater and more original in∣vention,
than there was room for displaying
in a subject so similar to Homer's, as that of
the Eneid is. It will be generally allowed,
that Shakespear is, in point of genius, supe∣rior
to Milton. The preference arises from
the superiority of his invention. In the lower
accomplishments of a poet, he is often defec∣tive:
but the richness of his descriptions, the
multiplicity and justness of his characters; the
variety, the compass, and the propriety of
his sentiments, bear the deepest marks of their
being original: and at the same time that the
internal excellences of his works display a lux∣uriance
of invention, we know that his edu∣cation
gave him but slender opportunities of
being acquainted with those ancient masters,
from whom he could have borrowed any of
his beauties, or by whose example he could
have even improved his natural powers.
There were many English rhymers before the
time of Chaucer; but he is justly reckoned
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
the father of English poetry, because he first
displayed invention in any considerable de∣gree.
If it were necessary to multiply ex∣amples
on this head, we might show that in
all the arts, invention has always been re∣garded
as the only criterion of Genius. Even
wildness and extravagance of invention, some∣times
procures higher praise, than the utmost
nicety and correctness. We ascribe so great
merit to invention, that on account of it, we
allow the artist who excels in it, the privilege
of transgressing established rules, and would
scarce wish even the redundancies of his na∣tural
force and spirit to be lopt off by culture:
this, we are afraid, might check the vigour
of his invention, which we reckon so capital
an excellence, that nothing could make
amends for the want of it.</P>
<P>IN science too, as well as in the arts, inven∣tion
is the proper province of Genius, and its
only certain measure. Socrates owes his re∣putation
for genius, to his being the inventor
of moral philosophy, and of a peculiar and
proper manner of communicating it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Socrates mihi vi∣detur, id quod constat inter omneis, <HI>primus</HI> a rebus occultis, et ab ipsa natura involutis, in quibus omnes ante eum philo∣sophi occupati fuerunt, avocavisse philosophiam, et ad vitam communem adduxisse. CIC. <HI>Acad. Quaest.</HI> lib. i. A quo haee omnis, quae est de vita et moribus, philosophia manavit. <HI>Tusc. Quaest.</HI> lib. iii. Socrates autem <HI>primus</HI> philosophiam de∣vocavit e coelo, et in urbibus collocavit, et in domos etiam in∣troduxit, et coegit de vita, et moribus, rebusque bonis et malis quaerere. Cujus multiplex ratio disputandi, rerumque varietas, et <HI>ingenii magnitudo</HI>—plura genera effecit diffentien∣tium philosophorum. <HI>Ibid.</HI> lib. v.</NOTE>. Ari∣stotle
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
is esteemed one of the greatest geniuses
of antiquity: it is because he made the most
extensive discoveries in philosophy. In phy∣sics,
in morals, in logic, in criticism, in po∣litics,
he has displayed a penetrating and
inventive mind, capable of remarking circum∣stances
and investigating general laws, which
lay concealed from others<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Diogenes Laertius introduces an account of his nu∣merous writings, amounting to near four hundred treatises, by remarking that it is proper to enumerate them, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and concludes his catalogue with ob∣serving the extensive invention which they evidence, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
of Bacon's genius will ever be admired. It
is the immensity of his discoveries, that leads
us to form so exalted an idea of it. In con∣tradiction
to the spirit of the philosophy in
which he had been educated, without assist∣ance
from those who had gone before him,
he was able to discover, what sciences had
been hitherto neglected, and what they should
contain; to add them to the sciences already
cultivated; to convert philosophy from an
art of disputation, into an instrument of sub∣jecting
the works of nature to the dominion
of man, and of producing useful arts; to
establish rules, formerly unknown, by which
genuine and inductive philosophy might be
cultivated, and raised to perfection; and to
make considerable progress in applying these
rules to the actual production of that stupen∣dous
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
edifice of knowlege, of which his com∣prehensive
mind had formed the plan.</P>
<P>IN every art and science, then, the praise
of genius is bestowed on invention, and is
proportioned to the degree of it. In general,
the first rank is assigned to those who have
invented, when there was no example or mo∣del
of which they could avail themselves,
when their predecessors had made no prepara∣tion
for their discoveries, nor given any hint
which could suggest them; and who have,
notwithstanding these disadvantages, brought
their designs to a considerable degree of per∣fection.
It is on this account, that Homer
stands without a rival in the poetic world.</P>
<P>THEY who prosecute the hints, or improve
the discoveries of those who have gone before
them, are ordinarily entitled only to the se∣cond
rank. It sometimes happens, however,
that an improvement or addition is so consi∣derable,
as to evidence invention equal to what
was displayed in the first essay. In that case,
we find the genius of the improver rated as
high as the person's who gave the hint. Aes∣chines,
Hyperides, and above all Demost∣henes,
who brought eloquence to perfection,
are celebrated for genius, at least as much as
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
Lysias, Isocrates, and Isaeus, who are consi∣dered
as the inventors of so many peculiar
stiles<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. Before the time of Archimedes,
geometry had been carried to a very consider∣able
degree of perfection; but he made so

disregarded, and the very names of those who
made them, totally forgotten. They who
made the first essays in painting, only circum∣scribed
their figures with a single line: their
works and themselves were soon buried in
oblivion. Their immediate successors in the
art, added but a few other lines by way of
shading; Cleophantus first daubed the figures
with a single colour, laid on every where
alike: but neither have these acquired fame<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Alii apud Sicyonem, alii apud Corinthios repertam [affirmant picturam] umbra hominis lineis circu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducta; ita∣quc talem primam suisse: secundam singulis coloribus, et monochromaton dictam, postquam operossor inventa erat: duratque talis etiam nunc.

<P>IT is acknowleged that the Greeks receiv∣ed
the beginnings of their knowlege in philo∣sophy
and mathematics, from the Egyptians;
but there is reason to suspect, that among the
Egyptians, these sciences were in a very im∣perfect
state: it is certain that the earliest
Greek philosophers learned, in Egypt, only
the first elements of mathematics. In Greece,
the sciences made rapid progress, and reached
a very high degree of improvement. If the
Egyptians were the inventors, this proves
them to be ingenious; but the Greeks shewed
themselves to possess superiour genius, and
are acknowleged to have possessed it, for
greater invention was necessary for the perfec∣tion
to which they rose. Arts and sciences
have been known to the Chinese for many
ages, held in the highest veneration, and stu∣died
with great ardor; yet they have not
gone beyond the elements of most of them.
This is an evidence that real genius is not
frequent among them. They are defective in
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
invention; they have some lucky ideas, but
they are incapable of pursuing them.</P>
<P>IT is worth while to remark, that some∣times
we are necessarily liable to error in
comparing the genius of different authors,
from the impossibility of our ascertaining, in
many cases, the degree of invention which
truly belongs to them. At one time we may
reckon that original, which is only imitation,
or even a servile copy; at another, what we
brand with these epithets of reproach, may
be really invention. This circumstance is
often of peculiar disadvantage to modern au∣thors;
and it leads us, perhaps, to ascribe
greater genius to the ancients, than they are
entitled to. The former are accused of bor∣rowing
from their predecessors, many prin∣ciples,
sentiments, or images, for which they
are indebted solely to their own genius. In
the latter, every thing is reckoned original,
because we know not, who had occupied it
before. We can form no objection against
the oldest authors extant, for the works of
those who wrote before them, are long since
lost. Aristotle had not, even in his time, the
means of discovering, in every particular,
how far Homer owed the perfections of his
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
works, to the lessons of others, and how far
to the excellence of his own genius<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Speaking of the entire unity of Homer's fables, he leaves it undetermined, whether he was directed in this by instruction, or by his own natural parts:<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To what Faculty of the Mind, Genius properly
belongs.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE invention is the infalliable crite∣rion
of Genius, we cannot better investi∣gate
the nature of Genius, than by enquiring,
what power of the mind it is, that qualifies
a man for invention? Invention is the capa∣city
of producing new beauties in works of
art, and new truths in matters of science;
which can be accomplished only by assembling
ideas in various positions and arrangements,
that we may obtain uncommon views of
them. Our intellectual powers, so far as it
is necessary to consider them at present, may
be reduced to four; Sense, Memory, Imagi∣nation,
and Judgment. By recollecting the
proper offices of these, we shall be able to de∣termine,
from which of them Genius derives
its origin.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35"/>
SENSE only perceives those objects which
are really existent, and actually exhibited to
the mind. It can, therefore, lead us to no
discovery beyond the objects that happen, in
the course of nature, to occur to it. It can∣not
carry us a step farther than the real things
which present themselves to its notice at any
one individual moment. Its sphere is thus
by much too narrow, to render it the parent
of invention<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It is obvious that we here use the word <HI>sense</HI> in an exten∣sive meaning, so as to include not only the external senses, but also that internal sense or consciousness, by which we attend to the operations of our own minds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEMORY is confined to a review of those
objects which have once been present to sense.
It gives a sort of duration to the perceptions
which sense has conveyed, but it can create
no new perceptions. Like a mirrour, it re∣flects
faithful images of the objects formerly
perceived by us, but can exhibit no form with
which it is not in this manner supplied. It
is in its nature a mere copier; it preserves
scrupulously the very position and arrange∣ment
of the original sensations, and gives us
along with this, a perception of their hav∣ing
been at some past time present to the
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
mind<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. It is thus precisely the reverse of
invention.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION is much less confined in its
operations. Even when it exerts itself in the
simplest manner, when it seems only to pre∣sent
ideas unattended with remembrance, it
in some degree displays its creative power.
It does not, like memory, professedly copy
its ideas from preceding perceptions of sense,
nor refer them to any prior archetypes. It
exhibits them as independent existences pro∣duced
by itself. It may be questioned, whe∣ther,
in some very peculiar cases, its power
extends not even to the formation of a simple
idea<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Treatise on Hum. Nat.</NOTE>. But it is certain that, when it only
exhibits simple ideas which have been deriv∣ed
from the senses, it confers something ori∣ginal
upon them, by the manner in which it
exhibits them. Light and heat are ideas
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
which memory retains exactly at all times,
and whenever we please, we can recollect our
having formerly perceived them by our senses.
But imagination can present these ideas, not
as copies, but as originals. We often form
them in a cold day, or in a dark night, with∣out
reflecting on our having perceived them
before; and consider them only as objects
which would be agreeable at present, or
which we may hereafter experience.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION is still more inventive in all
its other operations. It can lead us from a
perception that is present, to the view of
many more, and carry us through extensive,
distant, and untrodden fields of thought. It
can dart in an instant, from earth to heaven,
and from heaven to earth; it can run with
the greatest ease and celerity, through the
whole compass of nature, and even beyond its
utmost limits. It can transpose, vary, and
compound our perceptions into an endless
variety of forms, so as to produce numberless
combinations that are wholly new<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Quae est enim forma tam inusitata, tam nulla, quam non sibi ipse animus possit effingere? ut, quae numquam vidi∣mus, ea tamen formata habeamus, oppidorum situs, hominum figuras.—Nihil est enim, de quo cogitare nequcamus. CIC. <HI>de divinat.</HI> lib. ii.</NOTE>. Even
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
in sleep, when the senses are locked up, and
when the exercise of memory is totally sus∣pended,
imagination eminently displays its
inventive force; which is then so great, that
“the slow of speech make unpremeditated
harangues, or converse readily in languages
that they are but little acquainted with; the
grave abound in pleasantries, the dull in re∣partees
and points of wit. There is not a
more painful action of the mind, than inven∣tion;
yet in dreams it works with that ease
and activity that we are not sensible when
the faculty is employed, and we read without
stop or hesitation, letters, books, or papers,
which are merely the instantaneous sugges∣tions
of our own imaginations<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See SPECTATOR, No. 487.

<P>To the imagination, invention is accord∣ingly
referred, even by the generality of
mankind. If a poet or an orator only repeat
the sentiments of others, or be unable to
illustrate his subject with proper images, in∣cidents,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
characters, or observations, every
person imputes this defect of invention, to
the barrenness of his <HI>fancy.</HI> All genuine
productions in the arts, are marked with
strong signatures of a bright and lively imagi∣nation:
and every original work in science,
will be found, on examination, to proclaim a
force and vigour of the same power, though
the traces of it may not be so obvious at first
view. Imagination is, therefore, a source of
invention. Whether it be the only source,
will appear immediately.</P>
<P>JUDGMENT, in which we comprehend <HI>rea∣son,</HI>
from the comparison of ideas and sensa∣tions,
discovers relations which are not the
objects of sense. But many subjects admit of
the most copious invention, where the things
invented are not relations. Whatever influ∣ence,
therefore, judgment may have in some
kinds of invention, and however necessary for
perfecting the operations of Genius in every
kind, its assistance may be, it cannot be reck∣oned
properly the inventive power, as there
are many objects of invention, to which it
has not an immediate respect. Besides, even
in science, where relations are what we want
to discover, judgment cannot search out or
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
bring into view, the perceptions that are to
be compared. They must be suggested by
some other power, as we have occasion for
them; and till they are suggested, judgment
has nothing about which it may employ itself;
it must remain inactive, and can make no
comparison or deduction. Its sole business is,
to observe the relations of those perceptions
with which it is supplied by sense, memory,
or imagination, and to produce conviction by
its exertion.</P>
<P>OF all the kinds of judgment, <HI>reason</HI> has
most the appearance of an inventive power,
as it not only perceives the connexion of the
several parts of a proof, but also infers the
conclusion from all the parts together. Mr.
Locke analyses reason into two powers, Saga∣city,
and Illation; and ascribes to it four
different exercises. “The first and highest
degree of reason, says he, is the discover∣ing
and finding out of proofs; the second,
the regular and methodical disposition of
them, and laying them in a clear and fit
order, to make their connexion and force
be plainly and easily perceived; the third
is, the perceiving their connexion; and
the fourth, a making a right conclu∣sion.
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Essay concerning Human Understanding. B. iv. c. 17. § 2, 3.</NOTE>.” He might have justly given
this as an enumeration of all the steps which
the <HI>mind</HI> takes in the discovery of new con∣clusions:
But they are not all to be ascribed
to <HI>reason.</HI> The first of them, the finding out
of ideas or experiments which may serve for
proofs, is the province, not of reason, but of
imagination. It is imagination likewise, that
can be most properly said to order and dispose
the proofs. It arranges them in a certain
disposition; then reason surveys them, and
examines, whether this disposition is such as
can enable it to perceive their connexion. If
it does not, reason rejects that disposition;
and imagination is again set a working, ar∣ranges
them in a different manner, and con∣tinues
to vary the disposition, till it either
suggests one which reason finds sufficient for
its purpose, or till, after having wandered
through all the arrangements of its materials
that occur to it, it is wearied with the repeti∣tion
of unsuccessful attempts, and gives over
the work as desperate and impracticable. The
disposition, therefore, of the proofs must be
ascribed to imagination, though reason always
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
follows in its foot-steps, keeps pace with it,
and recalls it when it has made an useless ex∣cursion.
It follows, that the two last opera∣tions
which Locke assigns to reason, are the
only ones which properly and strictly belong
to it. Its business is, to perceive the connex∣ion
or force of the proofs, after they are di∣scovered
and arranged; and from the whole
train of them to infer a just conclusion. This
is performed by every man who learns a
science from the writings or instructions of
others. It must be performed before a per∣son
can comprehend a demonstration in Eu∣clid,
or the proof of any conclusion in philo∣sophy.
It implies, not genius, but mere
capacity; and is daily accomplished by mul∣titudes
who are not able to make any original
discovery in the sciences. Indeed, without
this, no invention in science can be <HI>compleat∣ed;</HI>
but without an imagination capable of
finding out and ordering the proofs, no inven∣tion
could be even <HI>begun.</HI> The chief diffi∣culty
in inventing new truths, regards that
part which is the work of imagination, the
discovering of fit intermediate ideas, or appo∣site
experiments, and the disposing of them
in such a manner that they may lead to just
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
and important conclusions. It is this that
requires genius, and is regarded as its proper
province. The rest demands, not invention,
but the same abilities which are necessary for
apprehending the discoveries of other men.
A person may be able to perceive, with the
greatest ease and certainty, the connexion
and force of proofs which are presented to
him in due order, who could not have con∣trived
or arranged these proofs. He may
possess reason in perfection, and yet be totally
destitute of invention, originality, and ge∣nius<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">In this enumeration, we have not mentioned <HI>taste,</HI> a faculty which confessdly has great influence on genius. The reasons will readily occur. It influences only some kinds of genius, not all the kinds; but we have here confined ourselves to the consideration of genius in general. Taste is not a sim∣ple, but a derived faculty. In respect of its principles, it is a compound of judgment and internal sense; <HI>(Essay on Taste,</HI> part 11. sect. 2.) and its effects on genius resemble, some∣times those of the one of these powers, and sometimes those of the other.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM these observations, it would appear,
that genius of every kind derives its imme∣diate
origin from the imagination. Mere
imagination, it is true, will not constitute
genius. If fancy were left entirely to itself,
it would run into wild caprice and extrava∣gance,
unworthy to be called invention. A
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
man who throws out indigested notions,
contradictory positions, trite and vulgar sen∣timents,
or foolish whimsies, is not said to
have invented them, but is rather blamed for
not having avoided them. As fancy has an
indirect dependence both on sense and me∣mory,
from which it receives the first ele∣ments
of all its conceptions, so when it exerts
itself in the way of genius, it has an imme∣diate
connexion with judgment, which must
constantly attend it, and correct and regulate
its suggestions. This connexion is so inti∣mate
that a man can scarce be said to have
invented till he has exercised his judgment<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ego porro ne invenisse quidem credo eum, qui non ju∣dicavit: nec▪ enim contraria, communia, stulta invenisse dicitur quisquam, sed non vitasse. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. iii. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
But still it is true that imagination invents,
and judgment only scrutinizes and determines
concerning what it has invented. It is ima∣gination
that produces genius; the other in∣tellectual
faculties lend their assistance to rear
the offspring of imagination to maturity. It
is also true, that in matters of speculation,
imagination resigns its discoveries into the
hands of reason, sooner than in the arts, and
leaves it more to finish. Yet it always sup∣plies
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
the subject on which reason is to work.
Without judgment, imagination would be
extravagant; but without imagination, judg∣ment
could do nothing. A bright and vigo∣rous
imagination joined with a very moderate
judgment, will produce genius, incorrect, it
may be, but fertile and extensive: but the
nicest judgment unattended with a good ima∣gination,
cannot bestow a single spark of
genius. It will form good sense, it will en∣able
a man to perceive every defect and error
in the discoveries of others; but it cannot
qualify him for supplying these defects, or
for being himself the author of any new in∣vention.
A man of mere judgment, is essen∣tially
different from a man of genius. The
former can employ his reason only on subjects
that are provided by others; but the latter
can provide subjects for himself. This abi∣lity
is owing solely to his possessing a com∣prehensive
imagination, which the former
wants.</P>
<P>IT is the imagination, therefore, with its
operations and laws, that we must especially
examine, in order to explain the nature of
Genius. The other faculties which assist it,
particularly judgment, which is more inti∣mately
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
connected with it than any of the rest,
will need to be considered, but are to be re∣garded
only in a secondary view.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Genius arises from the Imagination.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN memory presents ideas, it an∣nexes
to them a conviction that the
ideas themselves, or the objects from which
they are copied, were formerly perceived;
and it exhibits the ideas in the same form and
order in which the things themselves appear∣ed.
In time remembrance fails, ideas are
perceived without being referred to any prior
sensations of their originals, the order of the
parts is forgotten. But even then, ideas do
not lie in the mind without any connexion or
dependence. Imagination can connect them
by new relations. It knits them together by
other ties than what connected the real things
from which they are derived; and often be∣stows
an union upon ideas whose archetypes
had no relation. In this operation, it is far
from being capricious or irregular, but for
the most part observes general and established
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
rules. There are certain qualities which ei∣ther
really belong, or at least are supposed to
belong to all the ideas that are associated by
the imagination. These qualities must be
considered as, by the constitution of our na∣ture,
rendering ideas fit to be associated. It
is impossible to give a reason, why these qua∣lities
unite ideas: it is not necessary at pre∣sent
to explain particularly what they are.
Experience informs us, that the influence of
association is very great. By means of it,
multitudes of ideas originally distinct and un∣connected,
rise always in company, so that
one of them cannot make its appearance,
without introducing all the rest. On this
account, human thought is perfectly restless.
It requires no labour to run from one idea to
others. We have so great a propensity to do
it, that no resolution has force enough to re∣strain
us from it, nor will the strongest efforts
be able to confine us long to the contempla∣tion
of a single idea. We are incessantly
looking round to every side, without intend∣ing
it; we employ ourselves about many ob∣jects,
almost at the same instant<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Natura humani ingenii ita est agilis et velox, sic in omnem partem, ut ita dixerim, spectat, ut ne postit quidem aliquid agerc, tantum unum, in plura vero, non eodem die modo, fed eodem temporis momento vim suam impendat. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. i. cap. 20.</NOTE>. Nay,
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
association is often so strong, that it bestows a
sort of cohesion on several separate ideas, and
makes them start up in numberless combina∣tions,
many of them different from every
form which the senses have perceived; and
thus produces a new creation. In this ope∣ration
of the imagination, its associating
power, we shall, on a careful examination,
discover the origin of genius.</P>
<P>ASSOCIATION being an operation of fancy,
common to all men, some of its effects are
universal. In every individual, it displays
itself in many instances. Not to mention
such cases as are totally unconnected with our
present subject, scarce any person is so stupid,
as not to have sometime in his life, produced
a bright flash of imagination, though sur∣rounded,
it may be, with a wide extent of
darkness. But such transient blazes do not
necessarily imply real genius. It is something
more permanent and uniform. It requires a
peculiar vigour of association. In order to
produce it, the imagination must be compre∣hensive,
regular, and active.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="49"/>
GENIUS implies such <HI>comprehensiveness</HI> of
imagination as enables a man, on every occa∣sion,
to call in the conceptions that are neces∣sary
for executing the designs or compleating
the works in which he engages. This takes
place, when the associating principles are
strong, and fit for acting in an extensive
sphere. If they be weak, they will call in
memory to their aid. Unable to guide our
steps in an unknown country, they keep in
the roads to which we have been accustomed;
and are directed in suggesting ideas, by the
connexions which we remember. Every pro∣duction
of a man who labours under this de∣bility
of mind, bears evident marks of barren∣ness,
a quality more opposite to true genius
than any other. Nothing appears in it un∣common
or new; every thing is trite and
unoriginal. Or, if he attempts to quit the
beaten path, and start new game, he can
find out but a few ideas, he is exhausted by a
short excursion, and must either make a stop,
or return to the tracks of memory. Industry
endeavouring, in this manner, to supply the
want of a copious imagination, by accurate
remembrance or diligent observation, will
produce, instead of a philosopher, a devoted
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
follower, or a dull laborious commentator;
instead of a poet, a servile imitator, or a
painful translator. But when the associating
principles are vigorous, imagination, consci∣ous
as it were of its own strength, sallies
forth, without needing support or asking
assistance, into regions hitherto unexplored,
and penetrates into their remotest corners,
unfatigued with the length of the way. In
a man of genius, the power of association is
so great, that when any idea is present to his
mind, it immediately leads him to the con∣ception
of those that are connected with it.
No sooner almost is a design formed, or the
hint of a subject started, than all the ideas
which are requisite for compleating it, rush
into his view as if they were conjured up by
the force of magic. His daring imagination
traverses all nature, and collects materials fit
for his purpose, from all the most distant
corners of the universe; and presents them
at the very instant when they become useful
or necessary. In consequence of this, he
takes in a comprehensive view of every sub∣ject
to which his genius is adapted.</P>
<P>THUS, when the associating principles are
strong and have an extensive influence, they
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
naturally form, in proportion to the degree
of their strength, that boundless fertility, that
inexhaustible copiousness of invention, which
is not only one necessary ingredient in true
genius, but the first and most essential con∣stituent
of it. The smallest production will
in some measure discover, in what extent this
power is possessed. A work of real genius
always proclaims, in the clearest manner,
that immense quantities of materials have
been collected by fancy, and subjected to the
author's choice. There is no particular, per∣haps,
in the works of Homer, that has been
more universally remarked and admired,
than the prodigious compass of imagination,
which they show. His penetration has gain∣ed
him access to all the magazines of ideas,
and enabled him to draw materials from every
part of nature, and from the whole circle of
human arts. Knowlege of them was pre∣requisite,
but could have been of no service
after it was obtained, without the liveliest
fancy, suggesting them readily, and applying
them on suitable occasions. A comprehensive
imagination gave Newton so great command
over the natural and the intellectual world,
that, in his philosophical enquiries, he misses
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
no experiment which is necessary for pro∣moting
his investigation, and, in his mathe∣matical
researches, discovers every idea which
can be a proper medium for inferring his
conclusion, and includes in his problems
almost every case that can occur.</P>
<P>THIS extensive compass of thought enables
a man to derive from his own treasure, what
they who want it, are indebted for to the
works of others. He who possesseth a fertile
imagination, is under no necessity of arrogat∣ing
to himself the discoveries of others, or of
adorning his own productions with the beau∣ties
which he has pilfered from them. He
will not decline to use, on proper occasions,
the inventions of his predecessors, either in
science or in the arts; but in using them, he
will display his own genius. He will at least
preserve the full spirit of the original, not
contented with merely transmitting its form:
the propriety with which the imitation or the
theory is introduced, and the force, with
which it is applied, will show that it was not
merely copied from memory, but appositely
suggested by a vigorous imagination: and
frequently he will give farther proof of ge∣nius,
by improving on the borrowed hint,
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
by adding new beauties, or delivering a known
truth with greater elegance and justness.</P>
<P>GENIUS implies <HI>regularity,</HI> as well as
comprehensiveness of imagination. Regula∣rity
arises in a great measure from such a turn
of imagination as enables the associating prin∣ciples,
not only to introduce proper ideas,
but also to connect the design of the whole
with every idea that is introduced. When
the design is steddily kept in view, and the
mind so formed as to be strongly affected by
that associating quality by which the design
is related to the means of executing it, the
imagination can scarce fail of being regular
and correct. Any conception that is present,
will introduce most readily those ideas which
are related to the main design, as well as to
itself, though there should be a thousand
others bearing the same relation to itself, but
unconnected with the general subject. These
latter have only one tie, but the former have
a double relation, and will therefore rush into
the thoughts with double violence. They
will occur and be observed, while the rest ne∣ver
come into view, or, if they make their
appearance, are rejected so quickly that we
instantly forget our ever having thought of
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
them. No sooner does the imagination, in
a moment of wandering, suggest any idea not
conducive to the design, than the conception
of this design breaks in of its own accord,
and, like an antagonist muscle, counteracting
the other association, draws us off to the
view of a more proper idea.</P>
<P>IN this manner an attachment to the de∣sign
naturally produces that regularity of
imagination, that capacity of avoiding fo∣reign,
useless, and superfluous conceptions,
at the same time that none necessary or pro∣per
are passed by, which is always most per∣fect
in the greatest geniuses, and constitutes
no inconsiderable part of their excellence.
As acuteness of smell carries a dog along the
path of the game for which he searches, and
secures him against the danger of quitting it,
upon another scent: so this happy structure
of imagination leads the man of genius into
those tracks where the proper ideas lurk, and
not only enables him to discover them, but,
by a kind of instinctive infallibility, prevents
him from turning aside to wander in impro∣per
roads, or to spend his time in the con∣templation
of unapposite ideas. As the bee
extracts from such flowers as can supply
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
them, the juices which are proper to be con∣verted
into honey, without losing its labour
in sipping those juices which would be perni∣cious,
or in examining those vegetables which
are useless; so true genius discovers at once
the ideas which are conducive to its purpose,
without at all thinking of such as are unne∣cessary
or would obstruct it. The extent of
Homer's imagination is not more remarkable
than its regularity. Poets of inferiour genius
would have comprehended a history of the
Trojan war in one of his poems, and all the
events of the life of Ulysses in the other:
but his correct imagination admits no detail
inconsistent with the unity of the fable<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This is remarked particularly by Aristotle, as one of Homer's chief and distinguishing virtues. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>,
no shining episode that can be deemed uncon∣nected
with the subject, nor a single image
unsuitable to the nature of his work. In the
writings of Newton, we scarce find any ob∣servation
that is superfluous, any experiment
whose force is fully implied in any other,
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
any question or problem which has not some∣thing
peculiar.</P>
<P>NEITHER fertility nor regularity of ima∣gination
will form a good genius, if the one
be disjoined from the other. If fertility be
wanting, the correctest imagination will be
confined within narrow bounds, and will be
very slow in its operations; there can be no
penetration or copious invention. If regula∣rity
be absent, an exuberant invention will
lose itself in a wilderness of its own creation.
There is a false fertility, which arises from a
disordered and irregular fancy. As the same
idea bears some relation to an infinite num∣ber
of other ideas, the associating principles
may lead us, after a very few steps, to such
ideas as are connected with the last that was
present, yet have no connexion either with the
former ones, or with the main design. A
man, therefore, who follows any association,
however trivial or devious, that hits his fancy,
may show a great deal of imagination without
displaying any real genius. The imagination
produces abundance of glaring, brilliant
thoughts; but not being conducive to any fixt
design, nor organized into one whole, they
can be regarded only as an abortion of fancy,
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
not as the legitimate progeny of genius. A
multitude of ideas, collected by such an ima∣gination,
form a confused chaos, in which in∣consistent
conceptions are often mixt, concep∣tions
so unsuitable and disproportioned, that
they can no more be combined into one regu∣lar
work, than a number of wheels taken
from different watches, can be united into
one machine. Were it necessary to produce
instances of a fruitful imagination unproduc∣tive
of true genius, we might find enough
among those pretenders to poetry, who can,
through many lines, run from one shining
image to another, and finish many harmo∣nious
periods, without any sentiment or de∣sign;
or among those pretenders to science,
who can devise a hundred experiments, coin∣ciding
in all their material circumstances,
without a view to any conclusion, and with∣out
advancing useful knowledge a single step.
Such imagination is like a tree so overcharged
with fruit, that no part of it can come to full
maturity.</P>
<P>BUT even when a false luxuriance of fancy
does not extinguish true genius, it very much
diminishes its force and beauty. Sometimes
it overloads every subject with a superfluity of
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
illustration or of ornament, which either
wearies by introducing prolixity, or dazzles
too much to give entire satisfaction. A painter
who indulges this exuberance of fancy, will
multiply figures which increase the compo∣sition
of his work without adding to its ex∣pression,
which embarrass the spectator with∣out
having any share in the action, and which
seem to be introduced only that they may
aukwardly fill up an empty space upon the
canvas. Marini, says a French critic<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cavalier Marin ne s'est jamais veu une imagination plus fertile ne moin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reglie que la sienne. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il parle d'un rossignol on d'un rose, il en dit tout ce qu'on en pet imaginer; bien lain de rejetter ce qui se presente, il va chercher ce qui ne se presente pas, il <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>puise toujours son sujet. 4 <HI>Entret. d' Arist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> et <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE>, if
he mentions a nightingale or a rose, says
every thing on the subject that he can ima∣gine;
far from rejecting any idea that oc∣curs
to him, he goes in search of such as can∣not
naturally occur; he always lavishes on
his subject, every thing that can be thought
or said. Sometimes luxuriance of imagina∣tion
produces an irregular conduct in works
of genius, carrying the author every now
and then out of sight of his design, into di∣gressions
which have a very slender connexion
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
with it. This is remarkably exemplified in
Ariosto. He possesses great readiness and
quickness of genius; his inventions are sur∣prisingly
various; but that vivacity and agi∣lity
of fancy from which he derives these
virtues, has betrayed him into continual dis∣order
and incoherence, and unnatural inter∣ruptions
of his story. The <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> dis∣covers
inexhaustible richness of invention,
but is chargeable with the like irregularity.
It would be possible to bring instances of
both these kinds of vicious redundance from
the writings of a very great philosopher; we
might point out many passages in <HI>The Essay
on Human Understanding,</HI> in which Mr. Locke
has indulged both a tedious diffuseness in the
illustration of his subjet, and unseasonable
digressions from it.</P>
<P>A MAN is sometimes so entirely under the
power of accidental associations, that he seems
scarce to have proposed any end, but to have
designed to begin with one idea, to go from
that to any other which it happened by any
means to suggest, and so from this to others,
yielding up the mind to follow passively what∣ever
associations chance to affect it. This is
in an eminent degree the case of Montaigne
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
in many of his essays. He says justly of
himself, “What are these essays of mine but
grotesques and monstrous pieces of patch∣work,
put together without any certain
figure, or any order, connexion, or pro∣portion,
but what is accidental<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Liv. i. ch. 27.</NOTE>?” This
style of composition, carried to the utmost de∣gree
of incoherence, has been lately intro∣duced:
novelty, along with a great degree
of wit, humour, and fine feelings, procured
the first attempt considerable success; and this
success has raised a multitude of insipid imi∣tators.
It is only uncommon merit in the
parts, that can gain indulgence to such writ∣ings:
the total want of design is an essential
defect, and shows a capital imperfection in
the genius of the writer, an irregularity of
imagination.</P>
<P>THERE is in the human mind a strong
propensity to make excursions; which may
naturally be expected to exert itself most in
those who have the greatest quickness and
compass of imagination. If it be indulged
without reserve, it will produce incoherent
medleys, fantastical rhapsodies, or unmeaning
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
reveries. Often, however, the bye-roads of
association, as we may term them, lead to
rich and unexpected regions, give occasion to
noble sallies of imagination, and proclaim an
uncommon force of genius, able to penetrate
through unfrequented ways to lofty or beau∣tiful
conceptions. This is the character of
Pindar's genius, the boldness of which more
than compensates for its irregularity. The
truest genius is in hazard of sometimes run∣ning
into superfluities, and will find occasion
to prune the luxuriance, and rectify the dis∣order
of its first conceptions. But this fa∣culty
can never be reckoned perfect, till it
has acquired a capacity of avoiding them in
most cases. It must supply a large stock, and
at the same time manage it with economy.
While it produces all that is necessary, it must
evite all that is superfluous<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This is well expressed by Quintilian: speaking of rhe∣torical common-places, he observes, that they will be hurt∣ful, rather than beneficial; “Nisi et animi quaedam ingenita natura, et studio exercitata velocitas, recta nos ad ea quae conveniunt causae, ferant.” <HI>Instit. Orat.</HI> lib. v. cap. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS to render genius complete, fertility
and regularity of imagination must be united.
Their union forms that boundless penetration
which characterises true genius. By their
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
union they will be both improved: the one
will give us an ample choice; the other will
prevent our choice from being perplexed with
needless multiplicity. An extensive imagi∣nation,
impressed with a strong association of
the design, and regulated by it, will draw out
from the whole compass of nature, the suit∣able
ideas, without attending to any other.
In studying the works of a great genius, we
can scarce avoid supposing, that all possible
conceptions have been explicitly exposed to
his view, and subjected to his choice. The
apposite materials are collected in as great
abundance, and presented with as great pro∣priety,
as if this had been the case: and yet
perhaps, no other ideas have occurred to him,
but those which he has used. They, and
they alone, have been presented with entire
propriety, by the regularity of a compre∣hensive
imagination retaining sight of the de∣sign
through all the steps of its progress.
This effect, which results from the union of
these two virtues, is conspicuous in the great
poet and in the great philosopher whom we
have already mentioned, as eminently pos∣sessing
both. It may be observed by contrast∣ing
a single description of Shakespeare or
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
Thomson, with the laboured delineations of
a poetafter, who would supply the want of
genuine fancy by the industry of observation:
in the former, all the striking features of the
object, and none else, are strongly marked;
in the latter, every circumstance seems to be
taken notice of with the minuteness of a na∣tural
historian; but after all, those features
are omitted, which are fittest for making an
impression on the fancy. Compare Euclid
with his commentators; the opposition that
may be remarked between them, will set the
character of real genius in a strong light: the
train of Euclid's propositions is simple, yet
complete; his laborious expositors appear to
have intended to amass all possible propo∣sitions,
however trifling or unnecessary. One
can scarce read a paragraph in Butler's <HI>Ana∣logy,</HI>
or a chapter in Montesquieu's <HI>Spirit of
Laws,</HI> without being struck with the notion,
that the whole course of Providence was di∣rectly
in the view of the one, and the whole
history of mankind in the view of the other:
with so great appearance of readiness do they
observe even the remotest and least obvious
circumstances which can any wise affect their
argument. In studying a work of true ge∣nius,
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
when we attend to the multitude and
variety of the materials, we wonder how the
author could have found them all; and when
we reflect how proper and apposite every part
is, we are apt to think that it must have oc∣curred
to almost any person. Such is the
effect of copiousness and regularity of ima∣gination,
united and harmoniously exerted.</P>
<P>GENIUS implies likewise <HI>activity</HI> of ima∣gination.
Whenever a fine imagination pos∣sesses
healthful vigour, it will be continually
starting hints, and pouring in conceptions
upon the mind. As soon as any of them ap∣pears,
fancy, with the utmost alertness, places
them in every light, and enables us to pursue
them through all their consequences, that we
may be able to determine, whether they will
promote the design which we have in eye.
This activity of imagination, by which it
darts with the quickness of lightning, through
all possible views of the ideas which are pre∣sented,
arises from the same perfection of the
associating principles, which produces the
other qualities of genius. These principles
are so vigorous, that they will not allow the
mind to be unemployed for a moment, and
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
at the same time constantly suggest the design
of the work, as the point to which all this
employment tends. A false agility of ima∣gination
produces mere useless musing, or
endless reveries, and hurries a man over large
fields, without any settled aim: but true ge∣nius
pursues a fixt direction, and employs its
activity in continually starting such concep∣tions
as not only arise from the present idea,
but also terminate in the general subject: and
though a thousand arrangements of the con∣ceptions
which it starts, should fail of answer∣ing
the intention, it is indefatigable in trying
new arrangements, till it can happily accom∣plish
one that answers it. Whenever an image
or a sentiment occurs to the poet or the ora∣tor,
imagination sets it in every possible light,
enables him to conceive its genuine effect,
and thus puts it in his power to judge, whe∣ther
it ought to be rejected or retained. A
philosopher no sooner thinks of an experi∣ment
or an argument, than imagination, by
representing it in every attitude, enables him
to determine, what will be its force, and
whether it will be to his purpose. In this
manner the restless activity of imagination
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
quickly constructs a sort of model by which
we may form some idea of the work, before
we proceed to execute it.</P>
<P>THIS activity of imagination is of great
importance to genius. Genius may indeed,
in some degree, exist without it; ima∣gination
may be comprehensive when it is
exerted, and correct, and yet not active. But
without activity, genius will never exert it∣self,
except when excited and pushed for∣ward
by some external cause; activity of
fancy is like an internal stimulus, which will
not allow genius to lie idle or dormant, but
makes it operate spontaneously and with con∣stancy.
Without it, invention would at best
be very slow. Even after materials were sug∣gested,
their propriety could not be judged of,
till actual trial were made of their positions
and effects, at a great expence of time and
labour: and as such trial would be extremely
tedious and difficult, we would either take up
with the first view or position that occurred,
or relinquish all attempts, discouraged by the
prospect of that fatigue which must attend
the improvement of our plan. But when
fancy is expeditious in exhibiting every pos∣sible
arrangement of our conceptions, it
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
quickly puts it in our power to perceive all
their consequences and relations to our sub∣ject,
and enables us easily to make a choice,
and soon to finish our invention.</P>
<P>THUS the force of the imagination, or the
vigour of the associating principles, produces
genius, so far as it regards the collection,
and even the choice of fit materials for the
discovery that is proposed.</P>
<P>BUT invention is not completed by merely
depositing a sufficient quantity of proper ma∣terials,
in any order, as in a magazine or
store-house. In every case, some degree of
regular disposition is implied in the very no∣tion
of invention, and comes within the pro∣vince
of genius<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Collocare autem, etsi est commune, tamen ad inveni∣endum refertur. CIC. <HI>partit. Orat.</HI></NOTE>. It is not sufficient for a
builder to collect stones, timber, and what∣ever
else is necessary for the edifice, except
they be also properly disposed and united in
the fabric; so in the arts and sciences, a huge
collection of conceptions which bear some
relation to one another and to the main sub∣ject,
will form only a confused heap, if they
be not, by a proper disposition, united into
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
one regular work<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sed ut opera extruentibus satis non est, saxa atque ma∣teriam, et caetera aedisicanti utilia congerere, nisi disponendis iis collocandisque artificum manus adhibeatur: sie in dicendo quamlibet abundans rerum copia, cumulum tantum habeat atque congestum, nisi illas eadem dispositio in ordinem di∣gestas, atque inter se commissas devinxerit.

cannot be said to be designed, though all the
figures were conceived in their due propor∣tions,
till the artist has also formed a distinct
idea of the economy of the whole. If the
order of the notes in a musical composition
were altered, it would destroy the harmony,
which was the sole object of invention. As
an animal body will become monstrous, though
it has all its essential members, if one of
them be transferred to the place of another;
so a poem will become perfectly disagreeable
and fantastical, by the transposition of its
parts. A dislocation destroys the vigour of
any member of the body, and unfits it for
its proper function; and an oration will lose
its whole effect, if arguments, instead of be∣ing
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
distinctly urged, are blended together
without articulation. In science too, a mul∣titude
of ideas, if they be not arranged in
such a manner that their connexion may be
perceived, instead of leading us to discover a
conclusion, will only involve us in perplexity,
as an army thrown into disorder, can make
no advantage of its numbers, but, on the
contrary, obstructs its own motions. In every
case, disposition is so intimately connected
with invention, and even interwoven with
it, that it is impossible to separate them even
in idea. If therefore imagination contribute
nothing to the disposition of the materials, it
will follow, that genius must, in a consider∣able
degree, derive its origin from some
other power of the mind. But it will ap∣pear
upon enquiry, that imagination contri∣butes
very much to the disposition of every
work.</P>
<P>WHEN a person starts the first hint of a
new invention, and begins to meditate a
work either in art or science, his notion of
the whole is generally but imperfect and con∣fused.
When a number of apposrte concep∣tions
are collected, various views of their
connexions open to him, and perplex his
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
choice. But by degrees the prospect clears.
As related ideas are apt to be associated, so,
by the very same constitution of our nature,
those that are most nearly related will be
most strongly and intimately associated toge∣ther.
The operations of genius in forming
its designs, are of a more perfect kind than
the operations of art or industry in executing
them. A statuary conceives all the parts of
his work at once, though when he comes to
execute it, he can form only one member at
a time, and must during this interval leave
all the rest a shapeless block. An architect
contrives a whole palace in an instant; but
when he comes to build it, he must first pro∣vide
materials, and then rear the different
parts of the edifice only in succession. But
to collect the materials, and to order and ap∣ply
them, are not to genius distinct and suc∣cessive
works. This faculty bears a greater
resemblance to <HI>nature</HI> in its operations, than
to the less perfect energies of <HI>art.</HI> When a
vegetable draws in moisture from the earth,
nature, by the same action by which it draws
it in, and at the same time, converts it to
the nourishment of the plant: it at once cir∣culates
through its vessels, and is assimilated
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
to its several parts. In like manner, genius
arranges its ideas by the same operation, and
almost at the same time, that it collects them.
The same force of association which makes
us perceive the connexion of all the ideas
with the subject, leads us soon to perceive
also the various degrees of that connexion.
By means of it, these ideas, like a well-dis∣ciplined
army, fall, of their own accord, into
rank and order, and divide themselves into
different classes, according to their different
relations. The most strongly related unite of
course in the same member, and all the mem∣bers
are set in that position which association
leads us to assign to them, as the most na∣tural.
If the principles of association should
not at first lead readily to any disposition, or
should lead to one which is disapproved on
examination, they continue to exert them∣selves,
labour in searching for some other
method, project new ones, throw out the
unapposite ideas which perplex the mind and
impede its operations, and thus by their con∣tinued
efforts and unremitted activity, con∣duct
us at length to a regular form, in which
reason can find scarce any idea that is mis∣placed.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72"/>
THUS imagination is no unskilful architect;
it collects and chuses the materials; and
though they may at first lie in a rude and
undigested chaos, it in a great measure, by
its own force, by means of its associating
power, after repeated attempts and transpo∣sitions,
designs a regular and well-propor∣tioned
edifice.</P>
<P>A WEAKNESS of this methodising power
may arise either from a want of activity in
the imagination, or from our having a slight
association of the design. The former pre∣vents
our turning our conceptions readily into
different forms, and thereby leads us to take
up with the first that offers, however incor∣rect.
The latter prevents our being affected
by the different connexions of the parts,
which arise from their having different re∣spects
and subordinations to the general de∣sign.
From whatever cause this weakness
proceeds, it is a great imperfection in genius.
It renders it slow in forming its productions,
as the confusion of the materials occasions
difficulty in applying them to use: it also
renders them less valuable when they are
formed, as they retain, in some measure, the
appearance of disorder, intricacy, and dis∣agreeable
perplexity. Aristotle considers the
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
irregularity of disposition in Euripides as a
capital imperfection, for which nothing al∣most
but his singular power of interesting
and affecting could have made atonement<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. quoted above, Sect. i. Note <HI>(b).</HI></NOTE>.
In every art, the disposition of the subject
into a consistent plan, is indeed one of the
most important offices of invention; nor is
it a less momentous article, in discoveries
which respect the sciences. It is not more
absolutely necessary in an algebraical investi∣gation,
to ascertain the several quantities by
distint symbols, than to dispose these sym∣bols,
and the equations which are composed of
them, in a regular and convenient order.</P>
<P>ENTHUSIASM has been generally consi∣dered
as a very common, if not an insepa∣rable
attendant of genius. Poets have been
looked upon as inspired, both by themselves
and others. No man can be an accomplished
orator, who is not possessed of such sensibility
of heart, as to be actuated, at pleasure, by
the passions which he would excite in others.
Even the speculative philosopher and the cool
mathematician have often displayed a very
high degree of ardor in the exertion of their
genius. The explication which has been
given of the nature of genius, will not only
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
enable us to account for this, but incline us
also to reckon it impossible that ever an high
degree of genius should be unaccompanied
with something of that elevation and warmth
of imagination, which we term enthusiasm<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, who will not be suspected to be too great a favourer of enthusiasm, seems to assert, That it alone can dis∣pose men to search for new inventions in philosophy: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.
Genius turns our thoughts habitually to such
subjects as are adapted to it; habitual applica∣tion
to any subject, enables us to form strong
and lively conceptions of every thing relating
to it; a strong conception naturally invigo∣rates
and elevates the imagination in contem∣plating
it; and while this frame continues,
all the actions of the mind will be strong and
vehement. Such is the disposition with which
a man of genius turns his view to any sub∣ject;
as soon as he begins to think how it
may be compleated, he eyes it as a rich trea∣sure,
with delight and conscious pride; he
triumphs in the prospect of forming
<Q>“—he knows not what excelling things,”</Q>
and pursues all the associations which it pre∣sents,
with incredible eagerness and spirit.
When an ingenious track of thinking pre∣sents
itself, though but casually, to true ge∣nius,
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
occupied it may be with something else,
imagination darts alongst it with great rapi∣dity;
and by this rapidity its ardor is more
inflamed. The velocity of its motion sets it
on fire, like a chariot wheel which is kindled
by the quickness of its revolution. As a
sprightly courser continually mends his pace,
so genius, in proportion as it proceeds in its
subject, acquires new force and spirit, which
urges it on so vehemently, that it cannot be
restrained from prosecuting it. Difficulties in
the execution only excite its vigour, rouse its
keenness, and draw out its utmost efforts to
surmount them. Its motions become still
more impetuous, till the mind is enraptured
with the subject, and exalted into an extasy.
In this manner the fire of genius, like a di∣vine
impulse, raises the mind above itself,
and by the natural influence of imagination
actuates it as if it were supernaturally inspired.
The ardor which thus springs from the ex∣ertion
of genius, has sometimes risen to a
degree of fervour perfectly astonishing. Ar∣chimedes<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Quem ardorem studii censetis fuisse in Archimede, qui, dum in pulvere quaedam describit attentius, ne patriam qui∣dem captam esse senserit? CIC. <HI>de Fin.</HI> lib. v.</NOTE>, Protogenes<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Erat Protogenes in suburbano hortulo suo, hoe est De∣metrii castris.

<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
are said to have been so totally en∣tranced,
the two latter in painting, and the
former in the less enthusiastic investigation of
mathematical truth, as not to be diverted from
their works by all the terrors of hostile ar∣mies
taking by storm the places where they
were employed. It is reported of Marini,
that he was so intent on revising some stan∣zas
of his Adonis, that he suffered one of his
legs to be burnt for a considerable time, be∣fore
he was sensible of it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eloges des Sçavans, <HI>tom.</HI> 2.</NOTE>.—We may
remark farther, That as a kind of enthusi∣astic
ardour naturally arises from the exertion
of genius, so this ardour greatly assists and
improves the operations of genius. By ele∣vating
and enlivening the fancy, it gives
vigour and activity to its associating power,
enables it to proceed with alacrity in search∣ing
out the necessary ideas; and at the same
time, by engrossing us wholly in the present
subject, preserves us from attending to fo∣reign
ideas, which would confound our
thought, and retard our progress<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Les Peintres et les Poetes ne pouvent inventer de sang froid.

WE have now explained, how genius arises
from the perfection and vigour of the <HI>imagi∣nation.</HI>
However capricious and unaccount∣able
this faculty may be often reckoned, yet
it is subject to established laws; and is ca∣pable,
not only of such extent as qualifies it
for collecting ideas from all the parts of na∣ture,
but also of such regularity and correct∣ness
as is in a great measure sufficient for
avoiding all improper ideas, for selecting such
as are subordinate to the design, and for dis∣posing
them into a consistent plan, or a dis∣tinct
method. It is the first author of all
inventions, and has greater influence in car∣rying
them to perfection, than we are ready
to suspect. It forms what we properly call
genius in every art, and in every science.
It is always necessary indeed, that <HI>judgment</HI>
attend it in its operations, and assist it in dis∣covering
truth or beauty. In what ways it
does so, we shall next enquire.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the influence of Judgment upon Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH genius be properly a com∣prehensive,
regular, and active imagi∣nation,
yet it can never attain perfection, or
exert itself successfully on any subject, except
it be united with a sound and piercing judg∣ment.
The vigour of imagination carries
it forward to invention; but understanding
must always conduct it and regulate its mo∣tions.
A horse of high mettle ranging at
liberty, will run with great swiftness and
spirit, but in an irregular track and without
any fixt direction: a skilful rider makes him
move straight in the road, with equal spirit
and swiftness. In like manner, a fine ima∣gination
left to itself, will break out into
bold sallies and wild extravagance, and over∣leap
the bounds of truth or probability: but
when it is put under the management of
sound judgment, it leads to solid and useful
invention, without having its natural spright∣liness
in the least impaired.</P>
<P>IT is the union of an extensive imagina∣tion
with an accurate judgment, that has ac∣complished
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
the great geniuses of all ages.
In matters of science, the necessity of judg∣ment
is obvious: all the collections and ar∣rangements
of ideas which imagination makes,
are immediately subjected to reason, that it
may infer truth. If we be not careful to
distinguish those operations of the mind which
are performed in conjunction, we shall be
apt to refer philosophical genius wholly to
reason, overlooking the influence of imagina∣tion.
The assistance of reason is as truly ne∣cessary
in the fine arts as in science, though
in these it has not the appearance of being so
constantly applied. It is very remarkable
that all the fine arts have been cultivated, and
even brought to perfection, before the rules
of art were investigated or formed into a sys∣tem:
there is not a single instance of any art
that has begun to be practised in consequence
of rules being prescribed for it. The first
performers could not have explained the
several rules which the nature of their work
made necessary; but their judgment was not∣withstanding
so exact and vigorous as to pre∣vent
their transgressing them. Their correct∣ness
is so wonderfully perfect, that critics
discovered the rules which they prescribe,
only by remarking those laws by which true
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
genius, though uninstructed, had actually
governed itself. Aristotle does not invent
new rules of composition, but only points
out those which Homer had formerly observ∣ed
in the Epos, Sophocles in the Drama, and
many of the Grecian orators in Eloquence.
The same observation may be extended to
painting, music, and every other art. The
great geniuses who invented and improved
them, have possessed the acutest judgment,
which has faithfully attended them, and care∣fully
guarded their steps in those distant and
unfrequented regions which the boldness of
their fancy led them to explore: and judg∣ment
has sometimes exerted itself with so
great success, that the person who attempted
the first production in an art, has exhibited a
perfect model, in which posterity could find
no fault, and the excellence of which none of
their attempts could equal. The Iliad is at
once the first, and the best of Epic poems,
the admiration and the standard of all suc∣ceeding
ages. Had Homer, along with his
rich imagination, possessed inferior judgment,
his poem must, like the works of Shakespear,
have had great defects, excusable indeed,
but conspicuous and undeniable. A perfect
judgment is seldom bestowed by Nature,
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
even on her most favoured sons; but a very
considerable degree of it always belongs to
real genius. It may be remarked in the most
incorrect and irregular artists; even when it
has not force enough to discern every fault,
or when the violence of imagination is too
great to suffer it to be exerted with sufficient
severity, yet still it prevents perfect absur∣dity,
and restrains imagination from frantic
excursions. Pindar is judicious even in his
irregularities. The boldness of his fancy, if
it had been under no control from reason,
would have produced, not wild sublimity,
but madness and frenzy. Shakespear's judg∣ment
was not enough improved to enable him
always to avoid improper subjects, unnatural
and improbable incidents, forced and quib∣bling
expressions, or to perceive the regula∣rity
and simplicity which best suits the nature
of the drama; but in supporting the propriety
of character, in marking the fit expressions
and the natural effects of the several passions,
and in many other particulars, he displays
such an uncommon accuracy of judgment, as
leads us to impute his blemishes, rather to
the bad taste of those for whom he wrote,
than to any defect in his own understanding.
Judgment is of so great importance, that,
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
though we must often acknowlege genius in
works in which judgment has not been scru∣pulously
exercised, yet this circumstance never
fails to render them far less valuable than
they would have been, if they had been
finished with correctness. The irregularity
of Rubens's designs, and his injudicious
mixture of incongruous personages in many
of his pictures, throw a shade over those ex∣cellencies
which he possessed in perfection.
Nothing less than the highest degree of genius
can obtain lasting and thorough approbation,
when judgment has not been accurately exer∣cised.
Shakespear's unequalled genius has secur∣ed
him admiration. But very great genius was
not able to preserve Dryden from the ridicule
of those who were far his inferiors, on ac∣count
of incorrectnesses into which his unfor∣tunate
circumstances betrayed him; nor has
it obtained from impartial posterity, so great
attention and applause as much less abilities,
more judiciously exerted, would have certainly
commanded.</P>
<P>IN a man of genius, imagination can scarce
take a single step, but judgment should attend
it. The most luxuriant fancy stands most in
need of being checked by judgment. As a
rich soil produces not only the largest quan∣tity
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
of grain, but also the greatest profusion
of such weeds as tend to choak it; so a fertile
imagination, along with just and useful ideas,
produces many trifling, false, and improper
thoughts, which, if they be not immediately
examined by reason, and speedily rejected,
will over-run and obstruct the truth or the
beauty which the others might have pro∣duced
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nihil est feracius ingeniis, iis praesertim, quae discipli∣nis exculta <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt. Sed ut segetes faecundae et uberes, non solum fruges, verum herbas etiam effundunt inimicissimas frugibus; sic interdum ex illis locis, aut levia quaedam, aut causis aliena, aut non utilia gignuntur, quorum ab oratoris judicio delectus magnus adhibebitur. CIC. <HI>Orator.</HI></NOTE>.
Judgment cannot collect ideas, but it revises those which fancy has collected, and either adopts or rejects them, as it finds cause. Though a bright and comprehensive fancy be the principal ingredient in genius, yet nothing is so dangerous as to affect to display it constantly, or to indulge it without any control from reflection; nothing is pro∣ductive of greater faults. This leads philoso∣phers to construct whimsical hypotheses, in∣stead
of constructing just theories. This leads
poets to describe improbable events and unna∣tural
characters, and to search for unseason∣able
wit and ill-timed splendour, when judg∣ment
would have directed them to imitate
nature with exactness, and to study simplicity
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
of expression. This leads painters caprici∣ously
to create imaginary decorations, instead
of inventing natural and consistent embellish∣ments.
Imagination must set all the ideas
and all the analogies of things, which it col∣lects,
before the discerning eye of reason, and
submit them absolutely to its sovereign deci∣sion.
It is justly observed by Quintilian,
that every fiction of the human fancy is ap∣proved
in the moment of its production<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Omnia nostra, dum nascuntur, placent. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
The exertion of the mind which is requisite
in forming it, is agreeable; and the face of
novelty which infant conceptions wear, fails
not to recommend them promiscuously, till
reason has had time to survey and examine
them. Were reason never to scrutinize them,
all our ideas would be retained indiscrimi∣nately,
and the productions of fancy would
be perfectly monstrous. While a man is en∣gaged
in composition or investigation, he
often seems to himself to be fired with his
subject, and to teem with ideas; but on re∣vising
the work, finds that his judgment is
offended, and his time lost. An idea that
sparkled in the eye of fancy, is often con∣demned
by judgment as false and unsubstan∣tial.
A more rigid exercise of this latter
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
faculty, would have preserved Tasso from
introducing sentiments which have show
without justness, and figures which surprise
and dazzle, but are unsuitable to the purpose
to which they ought to have been subservient;
and would have enabled him to escape the
censure of having overspread his work with
tinsel, and thus sullied the lustre of the pure
gold which it contains<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">An ingenious critic, speaking of the rich poetic vein of Ariosto, says, Elle l'emporte véritablement sur la poösie de la Jerusalem délivréc, dont lcs figures ne sont pas souvent conve∣nables á l'endroit où le Poëte les met en oeuvre.

<P>A FERTILE imagination is apt to overload
a work with a superfluity of ideas: an accu∣rate
judgment rejects all that are unnecessary.
Shakespear was not always able to keep the
richness of his fancy from displaying itself in
cases where judgment would have directed
him to control it. That very exuberance of
imagination which commands our admiration,
is sometimes indulged so far as necessarily to
incur our censure. We need not be at a loss
for an example. In the Midsummer Night's
Dream<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Act. 3. scene 8.</NOTE>, Helena upbraiding Hermia, de∣scribes
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
the closeness of their early friendship
in the most natural manner, by expressive
circumstances suited to the state of childhood;
<Q><L>Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,</L>
<L>The sisters vows, the hours that we have spent,</L>
<L>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</L>
<L>For parting us; O! and is all forgot?</L>
<L>All school-days friendship, childhood innocence?</L>
<L>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</L>
<L>Created with our needles both one flower,</L>
<L>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion;</L>
<L>Both warbling of one song, both in one key;</L>
<L>As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds</L>
<L>Had been incorp'rate.——</L></Q>
But here the Poet's own imagination takes
fire, and he goes on:
<Q><L>——So we grew together</L>
<L>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</L>
<L>But yet an union in partition,</L>
<L>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</L>
<L>Or with two seeming bodies, but one heart,</L>
<L>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</L>
<L>Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.</L></Q>
And his imagination has crouded together
more images than would have been proper
though he had been describing infant friend∣ship
in his own person, not to mention that
some of them are frigid and far-fetched.
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
But the redundance is the more faulty, as the
description is put into the mouth of Helena,
who was too little at ease, too much distract∣ed
with vexation, to be at leisure to search for
a multitude of similitudes.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION will be often led by slight
and incidental associations, to suggest ideas
which, when canvassed by judgment, are
discovered to be foreign and improper.
When a man is no longer affected by the
association which conducted him to them, he
wonders how he ever could have thought that
pertinent, which he once admired. Painters
of considerable rank have represented friars
in the habit of their order, as present at some
of our Saviour's miracles. Judgment must
perceive this to be totally absurd; but their
religion prevented their exercising judgment
in the case. No less an artist than Michael
Angelo introduces Charon and his boat into
the solemnities of the future judgment paint∣ed
according to the Christian revelation.
The slightest exertion of judgment, would
have made him sensible of so great an incon∣gruity.
An idea may often likewise, in one
point of view, be adapted to a work, which,
if set in another light, would be unsuitable,
or less apposite. While fancy conceives the
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
various attitudes in which the idea may be
placed, judgment is wakeful and observant,
that it may chuse the properest.</P>
<P>REGULARITY of imagination, which is of
the greatest importance in genius, could ne∣ver
be acquired without the aid of judgment.
It is only judgment constantly exerting itself
along with fancy, and often checking it and
examining its ideas, that produces by degrees
a habit of correctness in thinking, and enures
the mind to move straight forward to the end
proposed, without declining into the bye∣paths
which run off on both sides. Imagina∣tion
is a faculty so wild in its own nature,
that it must be accustomed to the discipline of
reason before it can become tame and manage∣able
enough for a correct production. Nor
will it be capable of this even after it has ac∣quired
the greatest possible regularity, except
judgment attend it and perpetually curb its
motions. The most regular imagination will
sometimes make an unnatural excursion, and
present improper ideas; judgment must there∣fore
be ready to review its work, and to re∣ject
such ideas. Many of Bacon's conjectures
concerning subjects which he had not oppor∣tunity
to examine perfectly, are false though
they be ingenious, and would have been dis∣avowed
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
by judgment, when it had canvassed
them. Newton's imagination was more cor∣rect
than his, and more constantly under the
control of judgment; yet reason would have
perhaps, on examination, rejected some of
the suppositions which he makes in his que∣ries.
The first sketch of every work of ge∣nius,
is always very different from the finish∣ed
piece. Not only are many things added
by the posterior essays of imagination, affect∣ed
by new associations in repeated views of
the subject, and thus penetrating deeper into
its nature; but also many things are re∣trenched
or altered by judgment on a revisal,
which it had not force enough to prevent
fancy from exhibiting in the course of the
invention. Association could not recal the
idea of the design, in order to bring back
fancy when it has wandered from it, if judg∣ment
did not inform us that it had wandered,
by perceiving the tendency of the ideas which
it has suggested. The finest imagination,
totally destitute of assisstance from judgment,
would in some measure resemble a blind man,
who may be very dexterous in groping the
right road, but cannot know certainly, whe∣ther
he continues in it, and has no means of
recovering it. if he once stray.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90"/>
No degree of correctness can hinder imagi∣nation
from introducing different ideas that
are all conducive to the proposed design. But
some of them may promote it more than
others. In this case, judgment alone can de∣termine
which is fittest, and enable us to make
a choice. If it did not exert itself, fancy
must continue for ever at a stand, distracted
with the variety, and undetermined where to
fix. Sometimes again it happens, that tho'
each of the ideas is subservient to the end in
view, yet they are so incongruous that they
cannot be all adopted with propriety. Shake∣spear<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Measure for Measure.</NOTE> describes the terrors of death, by a
variety of very striking and poetical images;
<Q><L>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,</L>
<L>To live in cold obstruction, and to rot,</L>
<L>This sensible warm motion to become</L>
<L><HI>A kneaded clod;</HI> and the dilated spirit</L>
<L>To bath in fiery floods, or to reside</L>
<L>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,</L>
<L>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,</L>
<L>And blown with restless violence round about</L>
<L>The pendant world.—</L></Q>
All the ideas here introduced are conducive
to the poet's design, and might have been
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
suggested by the correctest fancy. It is only
judgment that can disapprove the uniting of
them in the same description, as being here∣rogencous,
derived partly from Christian
manners, and partly from pagan notions.
This faculty would have directed the poet to
retain only the former, as being most con∣gruous
to Claudio the speaker, or, if he
thought not these sufficient, to set fancy again
to work, to finish the description with con∣sistent
images.</P>
<P>EVERY work of genius is a whole, made
up by the regular combination of different
parts, so organized as to become altogether
subservient to a common end. The different
degrees of relation which the parts bear to
one another and to the end, affecting imagi∣nation
in proportion to their closeness, lead it
to assign to each its proper place, and thus
lay the foundation of a natural disposition.
But however perfectly the associating princi∣ples
perform this part of their office, a person
will scarce reckon himself certain of the pro∣priety
of that disposition, till it has been au∣thorised
by judgment. Fancy forms the plan
in a sort of mechanical or instinctive manner:
judgment, on reviewing it, perceives its rec∣titude
or its errors, as it were scientifically;
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
its decisions are founded on reflection, and
produce a conviction of their justness. The
same qualities which form natural relations
among the parts of a work, affecting the
imagination, produce correspondent philoso∣phical
relations among these parts, which
judgment can contemplate, in respect of which
it can compare the several parts, and discover
their influence on one another, and on the
whole, and can by this means perceive, with∣out
danger of error, the situations that ought
to be assigned them. For instance, in a fable
fit for tragedy, there are some incidents
which are properly causes, and others which
are their effects or consequences: causation
operating on the fancy as an associating qua∣lity,
will lead imagination, in the most rapid
career of invention, even though it should
outrun judgment, to place these incidents for
the most part in their natural situation, accord∣ing
to the relation which subsists between
them: and causation is at the same time a
philosophical relation, by contemplating which
judgment can determine, what incidents are
sit to form the beginning, what to form the
middle, and what the end. Thus even when
fancy is most successful in contriving a na∣tural
disposition, it is from the review of rea∣son
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
we derive assurance of its being natural
and just. But it often happens that fancy
throws its materials into disorder. In this
case it is only judgment that can perceive the
error. An accidental or trisling association
may mislead fancy; but judgment is not sub∣ject
to the impulse, it surveys deliberately
the connexions of the parts, it remarks their
mutual influence, it convinces us of the im∣propriety
of their position, and puts fancy
upon making efforts to imagine others, which
it attends to as they rise, and either rejects,
or apporves them.</P>
<P>To form a proper plain in any extensive
work of genius, is a matter of such difficulty
as to require the union of imagination and
reason in their greatest strength. Imagination
must exhibit all the various positions of the
parts, and conceive the effect of every part in
each of these positions. Judgment must at
the same time survey them with a piercing
eye, compare readily the effect of each part
in one position, with its effect in another,
and from the result of its comparisons, quickly
pronounce, which is the best arrangement.
Fancy could not have formed the regular
plan of an epic poem, though Homer had had
the strongest and most constant perception of
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
the end at which it aimed, if judgment had
not, from the consideration of this end, and
the repeated comparison of it with the means
which imagination proposed for accomplishing
it, discovered, in what situation every inci∣dent
would produce the very greatest effect.
One needs only read over the curious series
of experiments by which Newton has investi∣gated
the laws of light and colours, to be con∣vinced
that it required the nicest judgment,
as well as the most comprehensive imagina∣tion,
to conduct them in such a manner that
every succeeding one should confirm and ex∣tend
the conclusions to which the preceding
ones had given rise.</P>
<P>IT deserves also to be remarked, that every
difference in the nature of an invention, re∣quires
a correspondent variety in the disposi∣tion.
A fine imagination will in some mea∣sure,
by its own power, diversify the arrange∣ment
agreeably to the nature of the inven∣tion;
but it may reap great advantage from
the aid of judgment. When this faculty has
considered all the circumstances of the sub∣ject,
it can determine with certainty, which
of the plans suggested by fancy, will most
promote the perfection of the work. De∣mosthenes
and Aesehines have adopted dispo∣sitions
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
perfectly opposite, in their orations at
the trial of Ctesiphon. The opposite ends at
which they aimed, suggested this contrariety
of the means; but it was judgment perceiv∣ing
the one disposition fittest for impressing
the judges with a sense of Ctesiphon's guilt,
and the other fittest for convincing them of
his innocence, that determined the rival ora∣tors
to chuse the opposite roads which they
have taken.</P>
<P>THUS, while imagination is active in con∣ceiving
all the various combinations and ar∣rangements
of the ideas which it has collect∣ed,
judgment must be as indefatigable in sur∣veying
them, and determining concerning
their real force and consequences. It must
remark in an instant those positions of them
which are unfit for answering the purpose,
and be able, without losing much time in
scrutinizing them, to pitch upon those that
are sit. Fancy throws out both the worthless
earth and the rich ore; judgment, like a skil∣ful
refiner, distinguishes the one from the
other, and purifies the gold contained in the
latter, from the dross with which it is inter∣mingled.
The restless efforts of the most
healthful imagination would be both useless
and endless, if they were not subjected to the
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
cognizance of reason. To imagine all the
possible arrangements of a set of ideas, were
an unmeaning play of thought, if they merely
passed through the mind, like the images that
are said to succeed one another in the brown
study, without reason being able to arrest
such of them as it approves. Were reason
only slow in her determinations, in compari∣son
with the quickness with which fancy
conceives, like Una's dwarf, <HI>lagging behind
her far away,</HI> even this would greatly impede
the work of genius, retard its progress, or
stop it altogether by constantly curbing the
impetuosity of fancy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Atque plerosque videas haerentes circa singula, et dum inveniunt, et dum inventa ponderant. Quod etiam si idcirco fieret, ut semper optimis uterentur, abominanda tamen haec infelicitas erat, quae et cursum dicendi refrenat, et calorem cogitationis extinguit mora et diffidentia. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. viii. proem.</NOTE>. Or if its spirit were
too hardy to be wholly broken, it would out∣run
its companion; it would dispose a man to
take up with the first conception that occur∣red,
rather than weary himself in attempts to
procure better, when judgment were so dull
as not to distinguish readily which deserves
the preference.</P>
<P>IN this manner judgment assists, moderates,
and guides the exertions of imagination thro'
the whole course of the invention. But after
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
imagination has desisted from its work, judg∣ment
reviews, corrects, and finishes it. In
science, the work cannot receive even its rude
form till reason has compared the several
ideas and observations which fancy had sug∣gested,
and perceived their connexions, and
inferred their consequences. And in the arts,
where fancy is able to accomplish a sketch of
the whole, the review of reason is absolutely
necessary, to polish and improve the work.
Whenever fancy happens to stray, judgment
alone can perceive that it has strayed; and
though it has attended fancy during the whole
series of its investigations, observing its errors
and drawing it off from them, it is also re∣quisite
that it renew its examination when
the work is finished. It can then take a
more deliberate survey of the whole, and will
be able to reject or alter many things which
it formerly allowed to remain untouched,
either because it did not perceive them on a
transient view, or because it was unwilling to
chill the ardor of fancy by so long a delay as
would have been necessary for amending
them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. The end leads a person to the dis∣covery
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
of the means which are adapted to it;
and the mutual relations of these means de∣termine
the form and the situation into which
each of them should be thrown as it occurs;
judgment will pronounce concerning these
with considerable justness, during the forma∣tion
of the work: but after the work is finish∣ed,
when it has the whole in its view at once,
it has an opportunity of pronouncing many
decisions on points concerning which it had
not formerly the means of determining. A
view of the whole directs it to retrench one
part as superfluous in respect of the general
design, to enlarge another as defective, to
soften some features, to heighten others, to
brighten this part, and to cast that into a
shade.</P>
<P>IN the exertion of genius, judgment not
only regulates imagination, in the ways which
have been hitherto pointed out, but often
likewise supplies it with new materials.
Judgment cannot by its own power suggest a
train of ideas, but its determinations often put
fancy into a new track, and enable it to ex∣tend
its views. Imagination can introduce
ideas only by means of their connexion with
some present perception from which it sets out
in search of them: and this perception is in
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
many cases no other than a decision of judg∣ment.
Every review that judgment takes of
the productions of genius, discovers some re∣lation
of the parts. This relation is a new
perception which may transport fancy to
others that are connected with it, and thus
conduct it into regions which it did not for∣merly
think of exploring, and from which it
may bring home many conceptions fit for
perfecting its work. A few experiments will
enable a philosopher to exercise his judgment
so far as to guess at the conclusions to which
they lead, or to determine the different ways
in which the phenomena that they exhi∣bit,
may be accounted for. And this exer∣tion
of reason will lead him to imagine the
farther experiments that are necessary for
bringing the question to a decision, experi∣ments
of which he never would have thought
if this judgment had not intervened. It is
only a judgment that can be the occasion of
suggesting what is called an <HI>experimentum
crucis,</HI> in philosophical enquiries. Had not
judgment been properly exercised, M. Azout
could never have contrived an experiment of
this kind, for determining the cause of the
ascent of fluids in exhausted tubes, nor Sir
Isaac Newton for evincing indisputably that
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
the inequality of refraction in the prismatic
image, arises from an original difference in
the rays of which the light of the sun is com∣posed.
When a poet has, by the exercise of
judgment, determined the general nature and
qualities of the incidents which will be pro∣per
for promoting the end of his poem, this
determination will assist him in finding out
such incidents. Homer having discovered by
judgment, that the design of an epic poem
would be best accomplished by a series of inci∣dents
rising naturally from one another, and
by means of their mutual dependence consti∣tuting
one action, doubtless found many inci∣dents
suggested to him by this view of the
economy of the whole, which might have
otherwise escaped his notice. Spencer having
neglected to form such a previous judgment
of the nature of his work, needed all the
force of his amazing fancy, along with the
numerous fictions of romance, to furnish him
with such a variety of unconnected adventures
as might continually engage the soul and fill
it with surprise by their extravagance and
boldness. All the assistances in invention,
which orators have contrived, by means of
topics and common places, are founded on
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
this principle; That judgment, by surveying
the work directs imagination to many quar∣ters
where it may find conceptions adapted to
its purpose: and Quintilian justly observes,
that these artificial helps are no farther useful
than as they enable imagination to take the
hint from the decision of judgment, and by
its own force run directly forward to those
topics which suit the present case<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Illud quoque studiosi eloquentiae cogitent, neque om∣nibus in causis ea quae demonstravimus, cuncta posse reperiri: neque cum proposita fuerit materia dicendi, scrutanda singula, et velut ostiatim pulsanda, ut sciant an ad probandum id quod intendimus, forte respondeant, nisi cum discunt, et adhuc usu carent. Insinitam enim faciet ipsa res dicendi tarditatem, si semper necesse sit, ut tentantes unumquodque eorum quod sit aptum atque conveniens, experiendo noscamus. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. v. cap. 10.</NOTE>. Judg∣ment
will likewise give a new impulse to
fancy, and prompt us in invention, by per∣ceiving
an error, either in the matter or in the
disposition. The very same view of these
which serves to detect the fault, will often
suggest the means by which, not only it may
be rectified, but new truth or beauty also may
be produced. It is in this way that an exa∣mination
of the imperfect or faulty produc∣tions
of others, often enables a man of genius
to make advances in art or science, and leads
him on to new discoveries. In such ways as
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
these, judgment assists the imagination, by
putting it in the track of invention, as well
as by controling and regulating its opera∣tions.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Dependence of Genius on other intel∣lectual
Powers.</HEAD>
<P>IT was formerly observed, that all our in∣tellectual
powers may be reduced to four
classes, sense, memory, imagination, and judg∣ment.
We have found that Genius is the im∣mediate
offspring of the imagination, and
that it is attended by judgment in all its exer∣tions.
Its relation to sense and memory, is
more distant, and its dependence on them
more indirect. What is the precise nature of
this relation and dependence, will appear
from the following observations.</P>
<P>THE associating principles of the mind
would never exert themselves if they were not
excited into action by the impulse of some
object already perceived. It is only when
thus excited, that imagination runs out in
search of those ideas which are related to that
object. On this account, in analysing the
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
operations of genius, we must at last have re∣course
to some perception giving rise to them,
which was not itself suggested by imagination,
but exhibited either by sense or by memory<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Quicquid porro animo cernimus, id omne oritur a sen∣sibus. Cic. <HI>de sin.</HI> lib. i. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.
These faculties give therefore in a manner
the first hint of every invention; a hint per∣haps
inconsiderable in itself, but which may
in some sense be considered as the source of
the whole discovery that genius makes by
means of it. The largest river takes its rise
from some small fountain; issuing from this,
it rolls its streams over a long extent of coun∣try,
and is enlarged during its course by the
influx of many rivulets derived from springs
no more considerable than its own, till at last
it becomes an impassable torrent, liker to the
ocean than to the pitiful rill which purled
near its source. In like manner, even those
works of genius which appear most stupen∣dous
when they are compleated, spring at first
from some single perception of sense or me∣mory,
obvious, it may be, and trifling, and
become stupendous only by the gradual acces∣sion
of ideas suggested by perceptions equally
trivial and common. We admire with rea∣son,
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
the genius displayed by Newton in the
discovery of the laws of gravitation which the
celestial bodies observe in their revolutions.
It was perhaps his perceiving by sense a stone
or an apple fall to the ground, without any
visible force impelling it, or the remembrance
of this common appearance, that excited his
genius, and directed it to that train of thought
which conducted him at last to the investiga∣tion
of these laws. It is affirmed by an anci∣ent
author<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MACROB. lib. ii.</NOTE>, that the accidental hearing of
the noise of a smith's hammers of different
weights, gave Pythagoras the first hint of the
cause of the variety of musical sounds, and
led him by degrees into a complete theory of
music<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">An <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legant modern writer relates this remarkable story, to the following purpose. “Who would have thought that the clangorous noise of a smith's hammers should have given the first rise to music? Yet Macrobius, in his second book, relates that Pythagoras, in passing by a smith's shop, found that the sounds proceeding from the hammers were either more grave, or acute, according to the different weights of the hammers. The philosopher, to improve this hint, sus∣pends different weights by strings of the same bigness, and found in like manner that the sounds answered to the weights. This being discovered, he finds out those numbers which pro∣duced sounds that were conso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: as that two strings of the same substance and tension, the one being double the length of the other, gave that interval which is called <HI>diapason</HI> or an eighth; the same was also effected from two strings of the same length and size, the one having four times the tension of the other. By these steps, from so mean a beginning, did this man reduce, what was only before noise, to one of the most delightful sciences, by marrying it to the mathematics; and by that means caused it to be one of the most abltract and demonstrative of sciences.” SPECTATOR, No. 334.</NOTE>. No philosopher would ever go in
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
search of a theory, if some phenomenon sub∣jected
to his immediate observation, did not
dispose him to consider in what manner it
may be accounted for. It is the subject in
which a poet is engaged, and which he has
already conceived, that leads him, by resem∣blance,
to find out an image proper for illus∣trating
it. In every case, sense or memory
sets imagination at first in that road, by pur∣suing
which it arrives at important inven∣tions.</P>
<P>THE brightest imagination can suggest no
idea which is not originally derived from
sense and memory. In many cases, even in
such as very much display its power, it does
no more but call in seasonably the very con∣ceptions
which sense has conveyed, and which
memory retains. A philosopher is often led
to an important conclusion, by recollecting in
its proper place a phenomenon which he re∣members
to have very commonly observed.
A great part of poetry consists in descriptions
properly introduced, of those external objects
which the poet has actually observed, or in
the expression on suitable occasions, of the
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
sentiments and passions which he has himself
been conscious of, or which he has discovered
in other men on similar occasions. It is no
reproach to genius to receive its materials
thus wholly prepared, from sense and me∣mory.
Its force appears sufficiently in its
laying hold on them at the proper time, and
arranging them in regular order. Homer's
comparisons have ever been and will always
be admired as indications of surprising genius:
the immense variety of them, the facility with
which they appear to occur, the perfect cor∣respondence
of the images with the subject
for the illustration of which they are pro∣duced,
and the majestic simplicity with which
they are expressed, leave no room to doubt of
the poet's genius. But the images themselves
are generally drawn from such objects as he
well remembered to have seen. The frag∣ments
of true history which the fame poet
has related, are to be referred wholly to me∣mory;
imagination was employed only in the
introduction and application of them. In this
manner, as a master-builder has his materials
prepared by inferiour workmen, or as a his∣tory
painter is provided with his colours by
the labour of others, so the faculty of inven∣tion
often receives the entire ideas which it
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
exhibits, from the inferiour faculties, and
employs itself only in applying and arrange∣ing
them. Hence it proceeds that poets of
original genius always express the manners
of their own age, and the natural appear∣ances
which have occurred to themselves. It
was Homer's extensive observation of men
and things that supplied him with so immense
a field of thought. The customs of the age
directed Spenser, at least in part, to form his
plan on allegorical adventures of chivalry<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>WARTON's</HI> Observations on Spenser, p. 218.</NOTE>,
and induced Tasso to found his poem on a
holy war. Ossian's imagery is so different
from what would be suggested by the present
state of things, that a modern writer could
scarce bring himself to run into it, much less
to preserve it uniformly, by the utmost efforts
of study, or even by designed imitation; but
it is perfectly agreeable to all that we can con∣ceive
of the face of nature and the state of
society in the times when that author is sup∣posed
to have lived.</P>
<P>BUT even when imagination does not sug∣gest
conceptions which have been received
entire from sense and memory, but creates
such as are properly its own, it must still not∣withstanding
derive from these sources, the
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
ingredients of which it compounds them.
The parts and members of its ideas have
been conveyed separately by the senses, and
deposited in the memory, though fancy has
united them in a manner in which they were
never observed to be combined. The power
of fancy is subjected to the same limitation as
our power over the natural world. Give it a
stock of simple ideas, and it will produce an
endless variety of complex notions: but as
we can create no new substance, so neither
can we, except perhaps in a few very pecu∣liar
instances, imagine the idea of a simple
quality which we have never had access to
observe. When a philosopher attempts a new
experiment, he only places bodies already
known, in a situation in which these bodies
never were observed, but of which he has an
idea by having seen other bodies placed in
that or a like relation; and if he be able,
previous to actual trial, to guess what appear∣ances
the experiment will disclose, the ability
arises only from his remembering the result of
another experiment in some measure similar
to the present. The boldest fictions of the
poets, which least resemble any thing in na∣ture,
are yet composed of parts which really
exist in nature. When Homer formed the
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
idea of <HI>Chimera,</HI> he only joined into one ani∣mal,
parts which belonged to different ani∣mals;
the head of a lion, the body of a goat,
and the tail of a serpent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></BIBL></NOTE>. Phidias is said
to have formed his celebrated statue of Jupiter,
merely by the force of his imagination, from
Homer's description of that deity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></NOTE>. Yet
still he only varied a little the ordinary fea∣tures
of a man. Even those painters who
have been most celebrated for invention, have
generally satisfied themselves with inventing
the action, and have derived the particular
figures and their attitudes from observation
of several individuals, and sometimes even
from the imitation of one individual.</P>
<P>INDEED though it were possible for fancy
to create ideas wholly unlike to those things
which men have access to observe, the attempt
would prove entirely useless. The artist
might amuse himself with the forms of his
own creation, but they would produce no
effect either on the taste or on the passions of
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
others. Men can be touched only by ideas
which they are able readily to conceive; and
they can conceive only those ideas, the mem∣bers
of which sense has already deposited in
the memory. On this account we find it dif∣ficult
to enter into manners very different
from our own. The refinement to which
we are accustomed in modern times, renders
the simplicity of manners which Homer attri∣butes
to his heroes, an object of surprise.
That simplicity of manners prevailed in his
time, and prevented his contemporaries from
affixing an idea of meanness to many actions
and appearances in common life, from which
he derives comparisons to illustrate the su∣blimest
objects. But modern luxury has raised
the polite into a sphere so distinct from what
is termed low life, that we must put a sort of
force upon our minds, in order to separate
ideas of meanness from such things as can
now occur only in a shepherd's cottage or a
country village. Critics more delicate than
judicious, are so entirely under the insluence
of this prejudice, that they stigmatise the pas∣sages
of ancient authors which refer to cus∣toms
very different from those of the present
age.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="111"/>
MEMORY assists genius in another respect.
To recollect instead of inventing, shows a de∣fect
of genius; but it were faulty to be so
intent upon invention, as studiously to avoid
recollection on all occasions. If we lose sight
altogether of the beaten road of memory, we
shall be in danger of missing our way in the
winding paths of imagination. So bold an
adventurer will come at last to regions inha∣bited
only by monsters. It is not sufficient
for rendering a production natural, that its
separate parts be copied from real things;
the order and connexions of the real things
must likewise be in some measure imitated.
If the parts of a work be put in a situation
totally unlike to that which corresponding
objects in nature possess, it will give the same
kind of disgust as if the parts themselves had
been perfectly fantastical. If a philosopher
should deduce any phenomenon from a known
cause, by a process opposite to what we have
observed in similar cases, we would suspect
for this very reason, that his explication were
rather a whimsical hypothesis, than a legiti∣mate
invstigation, and we would readily
pronounce that his imagination might have
been corrected by his memory, and led into a
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
much juster train of thinking. If a number
of events natural in themselves, were com∣bined
in the action of a poem so as to succeed
one another in an order and by relations per∣fectly
dissimilar to every series which history
or our own observation had exhibited, we
could not but be disgusted with this deviation
from what memory informs us is the reality
of things. The course of nature is so steddy
and regular, that a certain analogy runs thro'
all the parts of it. Whenever any series of
events is exhibited to the mind, memory re∣collect
some other part of the course of na∣ture;
and if the ordinary analogy be want∣ing,
that series is pronounced unnatural and
improbable. On this account, even in cases
where the greatest latitude is allowed to in∣vention,
care must be taken that the offspring
of genius bear some resemblance to the por∣trait
of nature, which memory retains: and
this resemblance cannot be produced unless
memory is consulted while genius exerts
itself, and this latter faculty in this manner
vouchsafes to take its model from the former.
This is the foundation of Horace's rule:
<Q><L>Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris:</L>
<L>Ne, quodcunque volet, poscat sibi fabula credi<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ars Poet. v. 338.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
In a word, Genius is often led to its inven∣tions
by a train of ideas suggested to it by a
similar train which memory retains, and it
is only the remembrance of the latter that
enables judgment to determine concerning the
justness of the former.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the general Sources of the Varieties
of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>GENIUS always arises from those prin∣ciples
of the human mind which we
have pointed out; but it derives considerable
diversities of form from the different modifi∣cations
of these principles. Imagination be∣ing
that faculty which is the immediate source
of genius, we must search for the origin of
the varieties of genius, chiefly in the several
modifications of which imagination is suscep∣tible.
But because imagination is attended
and assisted in all the exertions of genius, by
other faculties, without the co-operation of
which its effects would be extremely imper∣fect,
some of the varieties of genius are no
doubt partly owing to the peculiar force or
modification of these other faculties. On this
account, an examination of the different
forms which all the powers combined in per∣fect
genius assume, and of the different laws
by which they are guided, will be necessary,
in order to prepare us for an investigation of
the different kinds of genius.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sources of the Varieties of Genius in the
Imagination; particularly of the Qualities
of Ideas which produce Association.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been remarked already, that imagi∣nation
produces genius chiefly by the
tendency which it has to associate different
perceptions, so that one of them being pre∣sent,
it may introduce others to our view
without our being conscious of any design or
our needing any effort to call them up. This
tendency of imagination has been often taken
notice of. Some late philosophers have ob∣served
that imagination does not act at ran∣dom
in associating ideas, and have, with con∣siderable
success, traced out the laws by which
it is governed, or ascertained those qualities
of ideas, and those relations subsisting between
ideas, which fit them for being associated or
for introducing each other into the mind<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Treatise on Human Nature, <HI>vol. i. part</HI> 1. <HI>sect.</HI> 4. Elements of Criticism, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.</NOTE>.
In examining this subject, so far as is necessary
for unfolding the principles of genius, I shall
not scrupulously avoid repeating what has
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
been observed by others; but shall endeavour
to throw all that occurs, into that form which
will be most subservient to the particular pur∣pose
which I have in view.</P>
<P>IN searching for the laws of association, it
is natural to enquire, first, what are the qua∣lities
or relations of ideas themselves, which
fit them for being associated; and next, whe∣ther
there be any principles in the human
constitution, which affect the association of
ideas, so as to make some to unite more rea∣dily
than others which yet are equally possess∣ed
of the associating qualities or relations.</P>
<P>AMONG those qualities or relations of
ideas, which fit them for being associated,
there is an obvious distinction: some of
them are <HI>simple,</HI> others are <HI>compounded.</HI> The
simple principles of association may be re∣duced
to three, <HI>resemblance, contrariety,</HI> and
<HI>vicinity.</HI></P>
<P>PERCEPTIONS may resemble one another
in different manners, and in very different
degrees; but whenever they at all resemble,
one of them being present to the mind, will
naturally transport it to the conception of the
other. When we look at a picture, we are
naturally led by resemblance, to think of the
person whom the picture represents. Per∣ceiving
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
any individual, we naturally think of
any other individual of the same species, with
which we happen to be acquainted. The
mention of any phenomenon or event, rea∣dily
brings into our view another phenome∣non
or event similar in its cause, its nature,
its circumstances, or its consequences. “It
hath been observed, says Lord Verulam<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sylva Sylvarum,</HI> Cent. 9. Exp. 83.</NOTE>,
by the ancients, that salt water will dissolvesve
salt put into it, in less time than fresh wa∣ter
will dissolve it.—Try it with sugar put
into water formerly sugared, and into other
water unsugared.” Here one fact suggests
an analogous or similar trial. Shakespear
represents Northumberland as guided by this
associating quality, when he saw Morton
come in haste from the battle where his son
had been engaged, pale, trembling, agitated,
at a loss what to say; and represents him very
naturally as led by this occasion to think of a
like event:
<Q><L>Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek</L>
<L>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</L>
<L>Ev'n such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</L>
<L>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-be-gone,</L>
<L>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</L>
<L>And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd;</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="118"/>
But Priam found the fire, ere he his tongue;</L>
<L>And I my Piercy's death, ere thou report'st it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Second part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 1. scene 3.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
Any one quality or circumstance common to
two perceptions, forms a resemblance between
them, sufficient to connect them in the ima∣gination:
it is generally such an imperfect
resemblance as this, that suggests similitudes
and images<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Non enim res tota toti rei necesse est, similis sit, sed ad ipsum, ad quod conferetur, similitudinem habeat oportet.<HI>Ad H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ren.</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CONTRARIETY is a word commonly used
with considerable latitude. There are some
perceptions which do not readily introduce
their contraries: but in very many instances
a perception does suggest another which is in
some sense contrary to it; and therefore con∣trariety
may justly be considered as a princi∣ple
of association. “The sun-beams, says
Verulam<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Inquisitio de Calore et Frigore.</NOTE>, do turn wine into vinegar;
but <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether they would not sweeten
verjuice?” In this case, one effect of the
sun-beams leads him to conceive a contrary
effect in a contrary subject. When light is
perceived, it does not easily suggests the idea
of darkness; but the perception of darkness
very quickly suggests the idea of light. In
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
health we are not ready to think of sickness;
but sickness forcibly introduceth the idea of
health. When we feel cold, we very natu∣rally
think of heat, and of the pleasure of those
who enjoy it. When we are warm and com∣fortably
lodged in a stormy night, it is not
uncommon to reflect with pity on the oppo∣site
condition of those who are abroad: here
however the association is assisted by, and is
perhaps chiefly owing to the perception of the
storm, suggesting ideas of its effects. Re∣markable
dangers or distresses in which a per∣son
has some time been involved, dwell on
his imagination, and are brought into his
view by every thing of an opposite nature, in
his after situation. A person raised suddenly
to prosperity, riches, or power, will some∣times
find his former poverty, meanness, or
obscurity forcing itself into his thoughts; and
they will much oftner be suggested to specta∣tors,
by the view of his present elevation. A
person fallen into adversity of any kind, will
find himself still more strongly disposed to
recollect the prosperity which preceded it;
the imagination of a spectator also is naturally
led to the thought of this. Old men oppressed
with infirmities, and become incapable of
enjoyment, naturally dwell on the strength,
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
the activity, and the pleasures of their youth.
A monarch groaning under the cares of go∣vernment,
and kept awake by his disquietude,
will readily think on the ease of the peasant,
and reflect,
<Q>How many thousands of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep!—<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Second Part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 3. scene 1.</NOTE></Q>
The reflection is suggested by a twofold con∣trariety,
that between the meanness of the
subject and the elevation of the king, and
that between the ease of the former and the
restlessness of the latter. A person's disposi∣tion
or conduct at one time, will put us in
mind of a contrary disposition which he has
possessed, or of a contrary conduct which he
has pursued, at another time. Friendship be∣tween
persons who have been reconciled, na∣turally
puts us in mind of their former en∣mity.
Enmity arising between old friends,
suggests the idea of their intimacy in times
past. Shakespear introduces King Henry as
saying, when he heard of Northumberland's
rebellion,
<Q><L>'Tis not ten years since Richard and Northum∣berland</L>
<L>Did feast together; and in two years after</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="121"/>
Were they at wars: it is but eight years since</L>
<L>This Piercy was the man nearest my soul,</L>
<L>Who like a brother to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd in my affairs,</L>
<L>And laid his love and life under my foot;</L>
<L>Yea, for my sake, ev'n to the eyes of Richard,</L>
<L>Gave him defiance.—<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Second part of Henry IV. act 3. scene 2.</NOTE></L></Q>
In like manner any species of behaviour in one
person, will sometimes suggest contrary or
very different conduct in another. Thus
King Henry, on hearing the exploits of
young Piercy, naturally says,
<Q><L>Yea there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin</L>
<L>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</L>
<L>Should be the father of so blest a son,</L>
<L>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,</L>
<L>Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</L>
<L>Who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride;</L>
<L>Whilst I by looking on the praise of him,</L>
<L>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</L>
<L>Of my young Harry.—<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">First part of Henry IV. act 1. scene 1.</NOTE></L></Q>
The same poet furnishes us with a compli∣cated
example of the influence of contrariety
in suggesting ideas, in a passage of Clifford's
speech to Henry VI. York's ambitious care
of his son, suggests the King's faulty indif∣ference
about his son; and this again sug∣gests
the care of brute creatures about their
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
offspring, their irrational nature forming at
the same time another contrast between them
and a human being:
<Q><L>He but a Duke, would have his son a King,</L>
<L>And raise his issue like a loving sire;</L>
<L>Thou being a King, blest with a goodly son,</L>
<L>Did'st yield consent to disinherit him;</L>
<L>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</L>
<L>Unreasonable creatures feed their young,</L>
<L>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,</L>
<L>Yet in protection of their tender ones</L>
<L>Who hath not seen them (even with those wings</L>
<L>Which sometimes they have us'd with fearful
flight)</L>
<L>Make war with him who climb'd into their nest,</L>
<L>Off'ring their own lives in their young's de∣fence?<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Third part of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. act 2. scene 3.</NOTE></L></Q>
Here two birds using their wings for repelling
danger, suggests to the poet the opposite pur∣pose
of flying from danger, for which they
commonly employ them. Thus many per∣ceptions
naturally introduce such others as
are in some sense contrary to them. Indeed
so much does contraricty influence the train
of our ideas, that a great part of common
conversation, especially that of old men, con∣sists
in remarking the changes, vicissitudes,
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
and reverses which they have had occasion to
observe in persons and in things.</P>
<P>VICINITY is likewise a principle of asso∣ciation
among ideas. The conception of any
object naturally carries the thought to the idea
of another object which was connected with it
either in place or in time. Mention one
house in a city, or one seat in a country with
which we are acquainted, we naturally think
and talk of others adjacent; and frequently
when we are not acquainted with them, we
even make an effort to imagine them. Bring
us to a place where we have formerly been,
or only speak of it, immediately ideas of per∣sons
whom we have seen, of conversations in
which we have been engaged, of actions
which we have done, or of scenes which we
have witnessed, in that place or near it, croud
into our mind.</P>
<Q><L>Nemo libenter recolit, qui laesit locum<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">PHAEDR. lib. i. fab. 18.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>If any event be mentioned, the mind very
naturally sets out from it, and goes on recol∣lecting
a whole series of successive events.
Nothing is more common than for an histo∣rian
to introduce the relation of an event no∣wise
related to his subject, with this observa∣tion,
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
that it happened in the place or about
the time of which he is writing. The pro∣lixity
of circumstantial and involved story∣tellers
often arises wholly from this, that
they croud into their narration, a multitude
of circumstances which have no connexion
with the thread of it, but have happened to
be contiguous in place or in time to some
particular incidents, and are continually sug∣gested
to the speaker, by means of this rela∣tion
“A gentleman,” says one of the
authors of the Spectator, “whom I had the
honour to be in company with the other
day, upon some occasion that he was pleas∣ed
to take, said, he remembered a very
pretty repartee made by a very witty man
in King Charles's time upon the like occa∣sion.
I remember, said he, much about
the time of Oates's plot, that a cousin∣german
and I were at the Bear in Holburn,—Jack
Thomson was there,—I am sure it
was spoken somewhere thereabouts, for we
drank a bottle in that neighbourhood every
evening<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">SPECTATOR, No. 138.</NOTE>.” The occasion of the story is suggested by means of resemblance; all the
circumstances of the story which we have
transcribed are suggested only by vicinity.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125"/>
THERE are other qualities or relations of a
compound nature, which fit ideas for being
associated and for introducing one another.
They are produced by the union of the simple
relations already mentioned, with one another
or with other circumstances. Such are <HI>co∣existence,
the relation of cause and effect,</HI> and
<HI>order.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN qualities are co-existent in any ob∣ject,
they are conceived by the mind as con∣nected
both in time and in place, and this
connexion is regarded as constant and per∣manent
These relations of the parts have so
great influence on the mind, and connect the
ideas of the parts so strongly in the imagina∣tion,
that we conceive them all with almost
as great facility as we could conceive any one
of them. On this account we bestow unity
on the whole collection, and consider them all
as making but one perception. We have so
strong a propensity to this, that it costs us
some trouble to analyse a complex perception
into its parts; and indeed this is seldom at∣tempted
by the generality of mankind. A
number of distinct perceptions being thus
united, by co-existence, in the imagination,
any one of them occurring to the mind, sug∣gests
the rest. If we sinell any fruit at a dis∣tance,
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
we immediately conceive its colour,
shape, and taste. If we should find one wheel
of a watch, or one part of a machine in a
desert, it would call up the idea of the ma∣chine
to which it belongs.</P>
<P>THE relation of cause and effect, which
likewise fits ideas for being associated, is a
compound relation: it includes conjunction in
place, for the cause is always conceived as
contiguous to its effect; it includes conjunc∣tion
in time, for the cause is always prior to
the effect; and the cause is always supposed
to exert power or energy in producing the
effect, or at least to have somehow a fitness to
produce it, so that the effect has a depend∣ence
upon that cause<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Causa autem ca est, quae id efficit, cujus est causa, ut vulnus, mortis; cruditas, morbi; ignis, ardoris. Itaque non sic causa intelligi debet, ut, quod cuique antecedat, id ei causa sit, sed quod cuique efficienter antecedat. Cic. <HI>de Fato.</HI></NOTE>. The conception of
a cause naturally leads us to think of the
effect; and the conception of an effect as na∣turally
conveys our thought to the idea of
the cause. The sight of a wound leads us
immediately to conceive both the pain which
it occasions, and the weapon by which it was
produced. Thinking of any person, we na∣turally
recollect some action of which he was
the author. Thinking of any transaction, we
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
naturally recollet the persons who were con∣cerned
in it, and even reflect on other parts
of their behaviour. The presence or the men∣tion
of the son of a friend, naturally intro∣duces
the idea of the father.</P>
<P>IT was remarked formerly that in every
work of genius, all the parts are connected
with the design, and that the strength of that
associating principle by which they are con∣nected
with it, produces <HI>regularity</HI> of imagi∣nation.
We may now observe that this con∣nexion
which subsists between the parts and
the design, and in general the connexion be∣tween
all means and their end, is a species of
the relation of cause and effect. Every part
of a regular work, both in science and in the
arts, either immediately promotes the design,
or is subservient to some other part which
promotes it. When a person has a distinct
view, and a strong and steady perception of
the design, it will lead him to conceive all the
subordinate ends which must be attained in
order to accomplish the main design, and
which, in respect of it, are means or imme∣diate
causes. Each of these subordinate ends
will suggest the means by which it may be
effected, keeping the ultimate design at the
same time constantly in view. Thus, by the
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
associating force of cause and effect, the whole
out-lines of the work will be at once presented
to the mind; and partly by means of this
relation, and partly by means of other rela∣tions
they will introduce all the conceptions
which are requisite for finishing it. What∣ever
conception is introduced, first the subor∣dinate
ends, and next, by their influence,
the ultimate end will recur to the thought,
and dispose us either to adopt the conception
as suitable, or to reject it as unserviceable.
When a person has a lively and consant view
of the end of a work, it will produce an ha∣bitual
sense that he is in search of means fit
to promote that end, though perhaps he does
not often explicitly reflect upon it. The
sense of this will keep his imagination in a
preparation and disposition for being peculi∣arly
affected with the relation between the
means and the end. In consequence of this,
not only does the end suggest the natural
means of promoting it, but moreover what∣ever
idea almost occurs to the mind, the per∣son
has a tendency to view it on all sides, on
purpose to see whether it can in any way con∣tribute
to that end, the perception of which
dwells continually on his imagination. The
effects of a strong association of the design,
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
were formerly pointed out; the observations
now made, explain what this association of
the design is, and how it is fitted for produ∣cing
these effects.</P>
<P>ORDER evidently produces a strong con∣nexion
between ideas, and gives one great
power to introduce others. It is a com∣pounded
relation which may take place either
between the parts of the same thing or be∣tween
different things. Order arises from
things being united or placed together, ac∣cording
as they are more closely related.
When the parts of a machine are properly
combined, they have order; if they be either
laid in a heap, or any of them misplaced, the
order is destroyed. In a regular treatise on
any subject, order is preserved through the
whole; in a set of aphorisms there is no order.
In the former case, one part very readily
suggests the rest; in the latter, it is not so.
It is this principle of order that gives the parts
of any regular syste a peculiar power to
sugges ideas both of the other parts and of
the whole. By means of it, the parts of an
edifice have a stricter union in the imagina∣tion,
than the parts of a heap of stones; the
parts of a plant or of an animal body in their
united sate, are more closely associated than
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
they would be if they were disunited and yet
huddled into a narrower compass. By means
of the same principle, an event will suggest
another on which it had an influence, much
more easily than one with which it had no
connexion, though contemporary or immedi∣ately
successive. We run with great facility
over a train of perceptions in order; but if
we neglect their order, the mind finds great
difficulty in passing from one of them to the
others.</P>
<P>ALL the relations of ideas, which fit them
for being associated, are reducible to those
that have been mentioned. We often ima∣gine
that some of these relations belong to
ideas to which they do not belong: but in
this case, as we are not sensible of our mis∣take,
they produce, though they be merely
imaginary, as strong association as if they had
been real.</P>
<P>BEFORE we finish this part of the subject,
it will not be improper to observe, That these
seveal relations or qualities of ideas operate
upon the imagination in an instinctive or me∣chanical
way, that is, without our reflecting
that they belong to the ideas. When one
idea has suggested another, we discover on
comparing them, that they do, for instance,
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
resemble each other: but it was not a pre∣vious
perception of their resemblance that
made the one to suggest the other; it sug∣gested
it instinctively without our perceiving
at the time, how or wherefore it suggested it.
Hence, though association of all the kinds
that have been mentioned, is natural to all
men, yet every man is so far from knowing
distinctly the qualities and relations of ideas
which produce association, that the enumera∣tion
of them is but a recent discovery among
philosophers themselves. Before two percep∣tions
can be compared, they must be both
present to the mind; but except it happen
that both are exhibited together by sense or
memory, one of them becomes present to the
mind only by its being suggested by the
other, by means of some of the relations
which subsist between them, operating mecha∣nically
on the imagination. In most cases
indeed, the relations of the ideas have been
often perceived; and the oftener they have
been attended to, and the more disinctly they
are apprehended, the more strongly will the
ideas be associated and the more readily will
one of them suggest the other. Imaginary,
groundless, and unnatural associations of ideas,
always presuppose an opinion, though a false
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
opinion, somehow imbibed of their being re∣lated;
but after this opinion is formed, the
supposed connexion operates on the imagina∣tion,
mechanically, and without our reflecting
on its original foundation. In the same me∣chanical
manner the real relations of ideas,
even such as have been most frequently re∣flected
upon, act on the imagination in sug∣gesting
one another; the previous compari∣sons
of the ideas, and perceptions of their
relations, are only causes which contribute to
their acting with the greater force.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Influence of Habit on Association.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall next enquire, What other
principles there are in the human
constitution, which affect the association of
ideas so as to make some to unite more readily
than others, equally possessed of the associating
qualities or relations just now enumerated.
There are two principles of this kind, whose
influence is very evident; <HI>habit,</HI> and <HI>the pas∣sions.</HI>
Any present perception introduces
such ideas related to it, as we have been ac∣customed
to, and such as are congruous to
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
the passion which influences us at the time,
much more readily than others which are
equally related to that perception. Both these
principles not only affect in this manner the
introduction of ideas which are associated by
means of relations subsiting between them,
but are likewise themselves distinct and sepa∣rate
causes of association: habit, or a present
passion, often suggests trains of ideas which
derive their connexion, not from their rela∣tion
to one another, but chiefly from their
congruity to the habit or the passion.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider habit as determining
some related ideas to be more readily associat∣ed
than others equally related, its effects are
chiefly the three following.</P>
<P>FIRST, An idea which custom has render∣ed
familiar to us, will be more easily intro∣duced
by any present perception, than an∣other
idea which is equally related to that
perception, but which we are little accustomed
to think upon. This effect of habit is very
conspicuous, not only in common life, but
likewise in all works of genius. It was re∣marked
before, that persons in the habits of
the modern religious orders are introduced
into many pictures representing parts of the
gospel history, and that a very little exercise
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
of judgment would have directed the painter
to reject this absurdity as soon as it came into
his thoughts: but glaring as the absurdity is,
it is by no means surprising that it should
come into the thoughts of a popish painter.
He is so much accustomed to see the religious
of his church, and they are so invariably
bearing a part in every action of a sacred na∣ture,
of which he can be a specator, that ha∣bit
can scarce fail to bring them into his
view, whenever the subject of his work has
any the slightest relation to them. There are
some objects and appearances of objects in
nature, open and obvious to the observation
of all, and therefore rendered by custom fa∣miliar
to all. These objects and appearances
supply the similitudes and images which have
been most early appropriated, and most fre∣quently
used by poets and orators. The rea∣son
is plain; because resemblance and habit
united their force in suggesting them, they
occurred more readily than images which
were suggested by resemblance alone. When
a writer abounds in images of this kind, and
in them only, we are apt to pronounce with∣out
hesitation, that he is a mere imitator.
But this judgment is too hastly: the same
cause which has rendered these images trite
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
and common, will always make a person of
indifferent genius to run into them, even
without imitation. Images from objects and
appearances which are not very common, can∣not
be suggested to a person, except his ima∣gination
be lively, so that the associating
principle of resemblance be vigorous enough
to introduce them without any assistance from
habit; and therefore a person who has a weak
imagination, is almost necessarily confined to
images taken from things whose familiarity
has made them already occur to many. Thus
the most common defect of genius in poets
and orators, is a striking instance of the power
which habit has to assist the operation of the
associating qualities of ideas. Its power is
likewise evident in authors and artists of the
greatest genius. A painter of real genius will
always represent, and a poet of real genius
will always draw his images from that state
and face of nature which occurs in the places
he is acquainted with, and those objects and
appearances which he himself has had occasion
to observe; and by this means he often dis∣tinguishes
himself from imitators, who not
having genius sufficient for observing the
great original, Nature, the real appearances
of things exhibited to themselves, describe
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
them as they have been already described by
others in situations totally different. But in
these imitators too, the force of custom in
facilitating the introduction of ideas, is ob∣servable:
they have often attended to the de∣scriptions
of others, they have seldom been
struck with the originals in Nature; by this
means the representations of others are more
familiar to them than any images of their
own; and that is the reason why they more
readily occur to them.</P>
<P>WHEN a person is intent on a particular
study, or meditating any work of genius,
when in consequence of this his thoughts
customarily dwell upon it, every thing that
occurs to him in reading, in conversation or
in life, immediately brings his present work
or study into his view, and sets him on think∣ing,
whether, and in what manner, it may
be accommodated to that work or study, and
rendered useful in them. Had the same thing
occurred to a person engaged in a different
pursuit, it would have led him, by the same
principle, to apply it to a quite different pur∣pose.
The example that was last produced,
suggests an illustration of this remark. An
ingenious modern critic being employed in
ascertaining the marks of imitation, took no∣tice
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
that some of the English poets describe
the Spring, not as they have observed it in
their own climate, but as they have been ac∣customed
to see it described by the poets of
warmer regions, who painted what they really
experienced: this, in conformity to the design
which occupied his thoughts, suggested to
him one mark of imitation, “That where the
local peculiarities of Nature are to be de∣scribed,
there an exact conformity of the
matter will evince an imitation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>HURD's</HI> Letter to Mr. Mason, on the Marks of Imitation.</NOTE>.” The
writer of this essay finding this observation in
that ingenious critic, it occurred to him, that
it might be applied in both its parts, for ex∣emplifying
the force of custom in promoting
the introduction of ideas connected by some of
the associating qualities. To a third person it
might have suggested something totally dif∣ferent,
but suitable to the particular purpose
which happened to be most familiar to him at
the time.</P>
<P>EVERY profession or way of life renders a
correspondent set of ideas familiar to a per∣son;
and in consquence of this, the fame
object frequently leads different persons into
totally different tracks of thinking. A plant
which suggests an image or description to a
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
poet, will engage the botanist in determining
to what class it belongs, the chemist in think∣ing
of the process by which it may be ana∣lysed,
and the physician in considering its
virtues as a medicine. The view of the hea∣vens
in a fine evening will lead the thoughts
of the astronomer to the system of the uni∣verse,
will make the painter conceive a land∣scape,
will supply the poet with noble image∣ry,
and engage the divine in a train of
religious meditation. Mention an event or
tell a story in a mixt company, it will suggest
to, perhaps, every individual of the com∣pany,
different thoughts or reflections; but
what it suggests to each, will generally be
something which his own habitual course of
life or a present accident renders familiar to
him. Tell the news of a battle, or speak of
a person who has fallen in it; the ladies ex∣press
their sympathy with the wives or mo∣thers
of the slain; the merchant takes notice
in what manner trade is affected by the war;
the soldier speaks of the glory of dying in the
field, or relates his own campaigns, exploits,
and wounds; the politician instructs the com∣pany
concerning the origin of the war, the
motives to it, and the advantages or the losses
to be derived from it; the scholar recollects
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
some battle rendered famous by classical de∣scription,
or traces the revolutions in the art
of war; and if there be a poet in the circle,
he will perhaps, inattentive to all that passes,
be employed in forming silently a lively con∣ception
of the scene.</P>
<P>IN all these instances it is plain that custom
gives great assistance to any of the associating
qualities with which it happens to co-operate,
and makes them introduce an idea that is fa∣miliar
to us rather than another less familiar,
though to this latter these qualities equally
belong. Conceptions to which we are not
accustomed, are shy to enter into the mind;
it requires a sort of force to bring them into
view; they must have a very strong relation to
the present perception before it be able to in∣troduce
them. But custom gives the ideas
which it has rendered familiar, a tendency to
occur; they stand ready, as it were, to enter
on the slightest occasion; we have a strong
propensity to think of them; any relation to
the present object of thought, however weak,
will be sufficient to introduce them; and a
strong relation to it, will suggest them with
the greatest ease and quickness. The disposi∣tion
of our mind towards familiar ideas, is
thus analogous to our inclination towards our
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
acquaintance; it is with a sort of reluctance,
or not without some ceremony, that we go
into the company of strangers; but we need
small inducement to seek the company of an
old friend; we enter into it with perfect ease,
nay cannot without difficulty be restrained
from entering into it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, custom renders us more apt to
be affected with one of the associating qualities
than with others. We shall have occasion to
observe afterwards, that by the original con∣stitution
of nature, the imagination is often
more apt to be affected with one of the asso∣ciating
qualities than with the rest. This
natural propensity may give occasion to a ha∣bit
of following chiefly one of them. But
though the mind were by nature equally open
to the influence of all the associating qualities,
yet various accidents may lead a person to be
influenced for a considerable time together,
by one associating quality only, or by one
much oftener than by others. Whenever
this happens, a habit will be acquired of pas∣sing
from one perception to another, by
means chiefly of that associating quality; and
that habit once formed, will produce a pro∣pensity
to continue still to trace perceptions
principally by that particular quality, or will
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
add strength to the propensity which was de∣rived
from nature. This observation might
be confirmed by a multitude of instances.
Let a person who has been much accustomed
to mathematical studies, write on the most
dissimilar subjects, he not only throws his
treatise as much as possible into the mathe∣matical
form, but is disposed to seek for and
conceive relations between his ideas, resem∣bling
the mathematical relations. It was per∣haps
the habit of attending to the mathe∣matical
sciences, that disposed Dr. Clark to
explain the foundation of morals, in the
manner in which he has explained it, to
place it in fitness or congruity, and to deduce
that congruity from abstract relations, instead
of referring it to the constitution of man, or
to the moral nature of God. If a person has
confined his reading for a considerable time to
the works of poets, he will find a disposition,
especially if his own stile be not yet perfectly
formed, to write on every subject in a figura∣tive
and poetical manner. In general, a per∣son's
manner of writing is formed in a great
degree, by the manner of those authors whom
he has been most accustomed to study: he
pursucs his thoughts in the same paths, dis∣poses
them by means of similar relations, and
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
even arranges his expressions, without reflec∣tion,
upon the same principles. This obser∣vation,
is equally applicable to painters, and
artists of every kind.</P>
<P>BUT we need not multiply examples of the
power of custom in disposing us to follow one
associating quality in preference to others;
for many of those which we have produced
under the former head, are apposite to our
present purpose. It is not only the familiarity
of the ideas which are suitable to our situation
and manner of life, that renders them sit to
be associated with any present perception, but
also their being connected with that percep∣tion
by a relation which our situation or man∣ner
of life has made familiar, and given us a
habit of being affected by. When the same
object suggests different ideas to different per∣sons,
these ideas are sometimes connected with
that object by the same relation; but gene∣rally
they are connected with it by different
relations, and the idea suggested to a particu∣lar
person, is such as bears that relation to
the present object, which he is by habit or
otherwise most prone to follow. By bestow∣ing
a very small degree of attention, this may
be observed in almost all the examples already
given of the force of custom in facilitating the
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
introduction of familiar ideas: I shall point
it out only in one of them. The same plant,
it was remarked, may suggest different ideas
to persons of different professions: it is by
resemblance that it suggests an image to the
poet, and resemblance is the relation by which
he is most accustomed to be affected; it is by
the relation of cause and effect that it suggests
the consideration of its elements to the che∣mist,
and of its virtues to the physician, and
that is the relation which their studies render
most familiar to them.</P>
<P>THUS, if nature has given a person a pecu∣liar
proneness to follow some one of the asso∣ciating
relations, the impulse of nature will
gradually produce an habit of following that
relation most frequently; and as soon as that
habit is produced, it will strengthen the natu∣ral
proneness: or if such a habit be produced
by accidental causes, it will of itself, without
any affistance from the natural constution of
the mind, beget a suitable propensity. Rela∣tions
which we are accustomed to follow in the
train of our thoughts, are like roads with
which we are acquainted, and in which we
therefore pursue a journey without any con∣cern,
hesitation, or deviation.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="144"/>
IT will not perhaps be superfluous to re∣mark
farther, that it is not only long custom
which produces this effect: the shortest cus∣tom,
such as cannot with propriety be said to
amount to a habit, is sufficient. When a per∣son
has been occasionally, for ever so short a
time, affected by one associating quality, he
acquires a propensity to continue to be affect∣ed
by that quality. When one has been any∣how
led to use several images or similitudes in
a composition, he is prone for some time to
run into the same figures. A metaphor once
employed, gives a person a disposition to pur∣sue
it, by means of which it is sometimes so
long continued as to produce an allegory. A
few contrasts or antitheses naturally and of
course lead an author into more. An exam∣ple
formerly produced of association by means
of contrariety<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The example from Clifford's speech to Henry VI. p. 115.</NOTE>, affords a plain proof of the
influence of a very transient custom.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Custom not only renders one
associating quality more ready to affect us,
than other qualities; it likewise renders the
same quality readier to operate on the imagi∣nation
after one particular manner than after
another manner. We shall hereafter have
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
occasion to examine the different forms which
the same associating quality assumes, or the
different ways in which it operates in intro∣ducing
ideas. In general, it is evident that
there are very different forms or species of
each of the associating qualities; for instance,
things <HI>resemble</HI> one another in many different
ways. Now one sort of resemblance may be
a powerful principle of association, to a par∣ticular
person on whom other sorts of resem∣blance
have very little influence; and the
propensity of that person to be affected chiefly
by this one sort, often proceeds, at least in
part, from his having acquired a habit of
being affected by it. An example formerly
made use of, may be applied for the illustra∣tion
of this. A plant suggests an image to a
poet, and leads a botanist to think of the class
to which it belongs; it operates on the ima∣ginations
of both, by <HI>resemblance;</HI> on the
poet, by the resemblance of its general ap∣pearance,
or of some of its particular quali∣ties,
to a distant subject; on the botanist, by
the exact resemblance of its parts to indivi∣duals
of the same kind. But these two sorts
of resemblance are almost as different from
one another as resemblance is from vicinity:
no two turns of imagination are more unlike
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
than that of the poet and that of the natural
historian. Both are in this instance affected
by the resemblance which the idea suggested
bears to the present object; but the one of
them is in no degree affected by the particu∣lar
species of resemblance which affects the
other. Every one almost of the associating
qualities is capable of as great variety as re∣semblace.
Now as a person may derive
from nature, a propensity to be influenced by
any of the associating qualities in one particu∣lar
way rather than in another way, so by
his being accustomed to be thus influenced,
that propensity will be increased. After the
observations which have been already made,
little needs to be said for confirmation of this.
It is as easy to conceive how a person may
acquire a habit of being affected by an asso∣ciating
quality in one particular manner, as
to conceive how he may acquire a habit of
being affected by one quality more than by
others: and when it has been proved that in
the latter case the habit begets a facility in
tracing ideas by that one quality to which a
person has been accustomed, it will easily be
allowed that the habit must have equal force
in disposing us to a particular mode of associ∣ation
by any quality. To recur to a former in∣stance,
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
there can be no doubt that it is partly
by their customary studies, as well as by the
natural turn of their imaginations, that the
poet and the botanist are led by the plant pre∣sented
to them, to ideas connected with it by
very different sorts of resemblance; and that
the chemist and the physician, though both
influenced by the relation of cause and effect,
are yet influenced by very different species of
that relation, and led, one to think of the ele∣ments
of which the plant is composed, and
the other to trace its effects on animal bodies.
Both in similitude and in metaphor, the
image is connected with the subjet by resem∣blance;
but a person may be rendered by
custom readier to express himself in one of
these figures than in the other.</P>
<P>IT is a necessary consequence of these effects
of habit, that it frequently opposes and over∣balances
the insluence of the associating qua∣lities.
A perception is present to the mind;
one idea is very strongly connected with it by
resemblance, or by some other relation; an∣other
idea is weakly related to it, but is ei∣ther
familiar to us, or is related by a tie or a
modification of a tie which we have been
much accustomed to follow: the relations of
ideas would introduce the former, but custom
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
often overpowers them, and gains the pre∣ference
to the latter. Custom sometimes co∣operates
with relations; and in that case it
augments their force: but sometimes it coun∣teracts
them; and whenever it does so, it
weakens or totally destroys their influence.
By this means the mind is often prevented
from pursuing a train of thought through
the strongest connexions, as it naturally would
if it were not influenced by habit. This is
the cause of many transitións in authors and
in conversation, which appear unnatural, and
are unaccountable to those who have not the
same habits.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have supposed the percep∣tions
which introduce one another, to be really
related by some of the associating qualities
formerly enumerated, and have shewn how
habit assists or obstructs the operation of these
qualities, or in what ways it affects the suc∣cession
of perceptions. But custom will like∣wise
produce an union between perceptions
which are not otherwise related. Though
two perceptions have no natural bond of
union, yet if they have happened to be pre∣sented
often together, one of them can scarce
ever appear afterwards without introducing
the other. In this case, as the connexion arises
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
wholly from the force of habit, so the degree
of that connexion is in proportion to the
strength of the habit, or to the number of in∣stances
in which the perceptions have occurred
together. Many examples of the power of
custom to beget an association of ideas, have
been often taken notice of: but though there
were no other, language alone would be a suf∣ficient
proof of this. The words of any lan∣guage
have no natural connexion with the
perceptions which they express. They owe
their signification wholly to compact: yet by
custom they acquire so firm a connexion with
sentiments, that no sooner is a word in a
known language pronounced, than it excites
the idea which it has been used for expressing,
and no sooner does a thought start up in the
mind, than it suggests a word correspondent
to it. Custom has bestowed upon them an
indissoluble connexion; and the most igno∣rant
scarce imagine that they have any con∣nexion
except that which custom has be∣stowed.
In language we perceive likewise,
that the strength of the association is in pro∣portion
to the strength of the habit. If a
person be but imperfectly accustomed to a
language, or have been long without the habit
of using it, the words of that language, though
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
he be acquainted with them, do not, by being
pronounced, suggest so quickly the ideas sig∣nified
by them, nor are themselves so readily
suggested, when he wants to express his own
sentiments, as the words of a language to
which he has been much and constantly ac∣customed.
A person for some time speaks
with hesitation, and understands with diffi∣iculty
a foreign language, though he knows
the words that are employed; but he speaks
his mother-tongue readily, and understands it
with ease<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The connexion established by custom, between ideas and the words of a language, being mutual, it may perhaps be thought, that the ideas should suggest the words, and the words the ideas, with equal quickness and ease. But this is not the case. The transition from the words to the ideas, is generally much easier than that from the ideas to the words. A person who is learning a strange language, will be able to understand a book or a conversation in that language long before he can write or speak it. Even in one's native tongue, one can rea∣dily understand what is written or spoken in the best and pro∣perest terms, though he could not have used these terms for ex∣pressing the same ideas; and many write or speak with difficulty and hesitation, who understand what they read or hear, with perfect ease. This proceeds from the first principle which we have established concerning the influence of custom upon asso∣ciation, and is a new instance for confirming and illustrating that principle. The ideas are more <HI>familiar</HI> to us than the words; they are often raised by their proper objects, or sug∣gested by other words; they often make their appearance in the mind, and are applied to various purposes, when the names of them are not thought upon; and their <HI>familiarity</HI> makes them to be suggested readily. That this is the true cause, is confirmed by observing that where it does not take place, ideas are not suggested more readily than words are in ordinary cases. When the ideas expressed are such as we have been little accustomed to attened to, a discourse or composition is understand by us with difficulty, as well as when ideas are expressed by unusual words: they are not familiar to us, and therefore are not redily suggested.</NOTE>. There is scarce any person but
has some favourite words and phrases, which
continually occur both in his conversation and
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
in his writings, though there be many others
in the language, equally fit for expressing the
same thought. The former having by some
means or other been frequently used by him,
and on that account become familiar to him,
rush into his mind of their own accord, when∣ever
the idea to which they correspond, is
present. But if at any time, disgusted with
the frequency of these terms, he be desirous
of diversifying his stile, it requires some time
and studied efforts to recollect the synonymous
terms that are less familiar to him, though he
knows them perfectly well. They are but
weakly connected by custom with his ideas,
and therefore they come not quickly into his
mind. Thus habit not only assists the associ∣ating
qualities in introducing ideas, but like∣wise
itself unites ideas to which none of the
associating qualities belong.</P>
<P>WE may farther remark an effect of habit
on the imagination, different from both these.
If a person has accustomed himself to any
particular object or action while he was em∣ployed
in pursuing a train of ideas, that ob∣ject
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
or action becomes absolutely necessary for
his pursuing any train. Without it, ideas,
though connected by relations as strong as
possible, cannot introduce one another; by
means of it, they are readily suggested: yet
the accustomed object or action has no more
connexion with any one train than with any
other, nor seems capable of either assisting
the relations which already unite the ideas,
or bestowing any new relation upon them. A
person may by custom become unable to think
or discourse of a subject, without keeping his
eye fixt in a particular direction, or indulging
himself in some usual posure or motion. De∣prive
some persons of a snuff-box, imme∣diately
fancy is extinguished, and a regular
or fluent succession of ideas can no longer
take place. “I sat by an eminent story-teller
and politician,” says an ingenious writer;
“I observed this gentleman t'other day in
the midst of a story diverted from it by
looking at something at a distance, and I
softly hid his box. But he returns to his
tale, and looking for his box, he cries, <HI>and
so, Sir</HI>—Then when he should have taken
a pinch, as <HI>I was saying,</HI> says he,—<HI>Has no
body seen my box?</HI> His friend beseeches him
to finish his narration: then he proceeds,
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
<HI>and so, Sir,—Where can my box be?</HI> Then
turning to me; <HI>Pray, Sir, did you see my
box?</HI> Yes, Sir, said I, I took it to see how
long you could live without it. He resumes
his tale, and I took notice that his dulness
was much more regular and fluent than
before<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">TATLER, No. 35.</NOTE>.” “I remember,” says Mr.
Addison, “when I was a young man, and
used to frequent Westminster-hall, there
was a counsellor who never pleaded with∣out
a piece of pack-thread in his hand,
which he used to twist about a thumb or a
finger, all the while he was speaking: the
wags of those days used to call it the thread
of his discourse, for he was not able to utter
a word without it. One of his clients, who
was more merry than wise, stole it from
him one day in the midst of his pleading;
but he had better have let it alone, for he
lost his cause by his jest<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">SPECTATOR, No. 407.</NOTE>.” The effect
of habit in these instances is very strange and
unaccountable. The custom has no greater
fitness for introducing any one set of ideas
than any other; the particular ideas which are
introduced, have no sort of connexion with the
circumstance which custom has rendered ne∣cessary
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
for their introduction, and perhaps
have never formerly been conjoined with it;
it seems to contribute to their introduction
only by preventing an uneasiness which would
indispose the mind for exerting its faculties.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Influence of the Passions on Association.</HEAD>
<P>THE other principle in human nature,
which has an influence on the associ∣ation
of ideas, which either promotes the in∣troduction
of such as are linked together by
some of the associating qualities, or introduces
ideas unconnected with each other, merely by
means of their relation to itself, is a present
passion.</P>
<P>A PASSION in strict propriety means only
such an emotion as is produced by some one
particular cause, and directed to some one de∣terminate
object. There are several emotions,
as remorse, self-approbation, and the like,
which may perhaps be reckoned sensations
rather than passions: but our present design
does not render it necessary to attend to that
distinction. A passion is something different
from an habitual temper or turn of mind: the
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
latter may in some instances have derived its
origin from the frequent returns or the long
continuance of a particular passion; but once
formed, it subsists without the operation of
any particular cause, and without being fixt
on any precise object, and produces a perma∣nent
propensity to any sentiments or passions
which are congruous to it. But a passion and
an habitual temper have so many things in
common, that we may without any incon∣venience
include both in the cause of associ∣ation
which we are now examining: it will
be sufficient to distinguish them in particular
instances, when such shall happen to occur,
in which their influence on the introduction
of ideas is different, or in which they run
counter to one another.</P>
<P>IN general, that the train of ideas suggested
to the mind, has a very great dependence on
the passions, is obvious. Mention some actions
of a person whom we love; our love will sug∣gest
such circumstances as tend to make us ap∣prove
these actions. Mention the very same
actions to another who entertains resentment
against the person who did them; and his
imagination will immediately clothe them
with such circumstances as destroy their merit,
or render them blameable. Let us barely
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
think of any person: if we love him, we rea∣dily
recollect and dwell upon the fair and
worthy parts of his character; if we hate
him, his wrong or suspicious actions croud
into our thoughts. The joyful heart runs
easily into a gay and pleasant train of think∣ing,
but does not naturally recollect any thing
that is gloomy, and instantly rejects it if it be
suggested by peculiar causes. The observa∣tion
holds of every emotion, passion, and dis∣position.</P>
<P>IT will be proper, however, to attempt a
fuller explication of the manner in which the
passions influence the association of ideas. To
understand this, is of great importance in a
theory of the varieties of genius; for to give
a just representation of the passions, is one of
the greatest efforts of genius; and it can be
accomplished only by following those paths
into which the passions naturally direct the
thoughts. But the influence of the passions
on the succession of our ideas, though thus
important, relates only to one species of ge∣nius
for the <HI>arts.</HI> It would therefore
be improper to enter on a full discussion of it
at present, when we are tracing out the <HI>gene∣ral</HI>
sources of the varieties of genius. In the
observations which we are now to make on
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
this subject, some examples will be necessary
both for illustrating and for confirming our
principles. It may perhaps be thought most
proper to draw these from our own experi∣ence
in real life. But to be able to select ex∣ample
from real life, and to set them in a
striking light, would require no small degree
of one of the highest and rarest kinds of poeti∣cal
genius. It will therefore be both the safest
and the best way, to take our examples from
such representations of the passions in poetry,
as are confessedly natural, and will approve
themselves natural to the taste of the reader.
Such examples have as great authority as in∣stances
which a person himself observes in or∣dinary
life. Shakespear alone will almost sup∣ply
us with as many as are necessary.</P>
<P>IN taking a general view of the influence
of the passions on association, it will be neces∣sry,
first, to point out the manner in which
they affect the <HI>nature</HI> of the ideas selected and
introduced.</P>
<P>THERE are some ideas intimately connected
with a passion, as the object of the passion, its
cause, what is sit for supporting it, or what
gratifies it. Every passion has a strong ten∣dency
to suggest sch ideas, to force them
into our view, to make us prone to conceive
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
them. We naturally continue fixt in atten∣tion
to such ideas, or recur often to the con∣templation
of them. A passion leads us to
them, solely by its own force, without any
assistance from a present perception connected
with them. When a person is under the in∣fluence
of any passion, the difficulty is not to
recollect the objects closely connected with it,
but to prevent their haunting him continually.
An angry man, for example, can scarce avoid
thinking of the person who has offended him,
and of the injury which he has done him, re∣collecting
every thing he can dishonourable
to that person remembering with pleasure the
misfortunes which have happened to him,
even imagining distresses into which he may
fall, and in a word dwelling on the concep∣tion
of every thing immediately relating to
his anger. Angelo's description of his own
disposition when he was under the power of
love, is perfectly natural;</P>
<Q><L>When I would pray and think, I think and pray</L>
<L>To several subjects: heav'n hath my empty words,</L>
<L>Whilst my intention hearing not my tongue,</L>
<L>Anchors on Isabel: heav'n's in my mouth,</L>
<L>As if I did but only chew its name,</L>
<L>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</L>
<L>Of my conception.—<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Measure for Measure, <HI>act 2. scene</HI> 10.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P><PB N="152" REF="159"/>
DIFFERENT ideas are in different ways
closely connected with the same passion; the
passion tends to introduce all these. On this
account it often happens that the mind does
not rest on any one of them, but conceives
them all by turns. Every passion often occa∣sions
an abruptness of thought; this is one
cause of that abruptness; different ideas being
connected with the passion, in different re∣spects,
but with almost equal closeness, the
passion introduces them all, or several of them
at least, in alternate succession. Sebastian over∣whelmed
with fear and grief by the prospect
of immediate shipwreck, exclaims,</P>
<Q><L>—Mercy on us!</L></Q>
<P>We split, we split! farewel my wife and children,
Brother farewel! we split, we split, we split!<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tempest, act 1. scene 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>His passion leads him to think of himself, its
most immediate object; but without suffering
him to rest a moment on this, it hurries him on
to a conception of the cause of his passion, the
splitting of the ship; it allows him to make
but a very short stop here; it causes his family
and friends, objects which were likewise nearly
related to his grief, to croud into his view;
and from these, it forces him back to the
thought of the immediate cause of his passion,
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
and makes his mind to dwell upon it. It
suffers him not to think of any thing that has
not an intimate relation to itself, and it makes
his imagination to vibrate between those
which have such relation. Isabel being in∣formed
that her brother had been put to death
by Angelo's command, her resentment imme∣diately
suggesest some means of revenging
his death; but without suffering her to rest
on these means, or to take any notice of the
impossibility of her employing them, even
though it is mentioned to her, resentment
brings into her thoughts in an instant, her
brother, herself, the wickedness of mankind,
and the baseness of Angelo, all objects natu∣turally
connected with her passion:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I will to him and pluck out his eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall not be admitted to his sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Measure for Measure, <HI>act</HI> 4. <HI>scene</HI> 10.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<P>IF a passion can thus introduce ideas suitable
to it, merely by its own force, it will much
more introduce them when there happens to
be a perception present to the mind, to which
they bear any of the associating relations.
Either the passion alone, or that relation alone
would have been sufficient for the effect:
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
when both therefore operate together, they
are like mechanical forces acting in the same
direction, which produce a double effect, or
produce the same effect with half the diffi∣culty.
When any passion prevails in the
soul, ideas strictly connected with that pas∣sion
are in a continual readiness to rush into
the thoughts on every the slightest occasion.
Hence it is commonly observed that the most
distant hint is sufficient to direct the imagina∣tion
to an object which is congruous to the
present disposition of the mind. We have a
very natural and strong representation of this
in Lear's grief and indignation on account of
the unkindness of his daughters. When he
sees Edgar's dismal situation, he says,
<Q><P>“Did'st thou give all to thy daughters? and art
thou come to this?”</P>
<P>On hearing his raving, the same thought
again rushes into Lear's mind,</P>
<P>“What! have his daughters brought him to this
pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Did'st thou
give'em all?”</P>
<P>The fool's interruption could not divert the
thought; he goes on,</P>
<P>Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated o'er men's faults, light on thy
daughters!</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="162"/>
“He hath no daughters, Sir,”</P></Q>
says Kent: but still the object before him,
keeps the same idea rivetted in his imagina∣tion;
<Q><L>Death, traitor, nothing could have subdu'd nature</L>
<L>To such a lowness, but his unkind daughters.</L>
<L>Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers</L>
<L>Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?</L>
<L>Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot</L>
<L>Those pelican daughters.—<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>King Lear,</HI> act 3. scene 6.</NOTE></L></Q>
There are ordinarily many occasions which
have a powerful tendency to suggest to a per∣son
possessed by a passion, objects altogether
unrelated to that passion: the mind is always
disposed to reject these, and in consequence of
this, it pursues one of two courses. Some∣times
it takes a handle from the objects that
occur, whatever they be, to recollect some∣thing
suitable to the present passion, it ima∣gines
those objects related to this passion,
though their analogy to it be very remote,
as in the example just now given, nay tho'
they have not even a shadow of connexion
with it. Harpagon going out of his garden
in quest of the officers of justice, after he had
missed his casket of money, and seeing the
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
people in the street, is naturally made to
say;</P>
<P>“ What a croud's here got together! I can
cast my eyes on no body who gives me not
suspicion, every thing seems my thief. Heh!
what are they talking of there? Of him that
robbed me? What noise is that above? Is it
my thief that's there? For heaven's sake, if
you know tidings of my thief, I beseech you
tell me. Is he not hid there amongst you?
They all stare at me, and fall a laughing.
You'll see that they are certainly concerned
in this robbery committed upon me. Here,
quick, commissaries, archers, provosts, judges,
racks, gibbets, and executioners<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Que de gens assemblés! Je ne jette mes regards fur personne qui ne me donne des soupçons, et tout me semble mon voleur. Eh! de quoi est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce qu'on parle la? de celui qui m'a dérobé? Quel bruit fait-on la haut? Est-ce mon vo∣leur qui est? De grace, si l'on sait des nouvelles de mon vo∣leur, je supplie que l'on m'en dise. N'est-il point caché là parmi vous? ils me regardent tous, et se mettent à rire. Vous verrez qu'ils ont part sans doute au vol que l'on ma fait. Allons vîte, des commissaires, des archers, des prévots, des juges, des gênes, des potences, et des bourreaux. L'Avare DE MOLIERE, act 4. scene 7.</NOTE>.[endq;]</P>
<P>This happens when the passion is violent,
and when the tendency of the present objects
to suggest ideas unsuitable to it, is not very
strong. But when the passion is not so vio∣lent,
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
or when it is an habitual disposition that
prevails in the soul, and when at the same
time the present objects have a strong ten∣dency
to lead the thoughts to ideas unrelated
to that passion or disposition, the mind takes
a different course: it goes backward and for∣ward
between the ideas suggested by the pas∣sion,
and the ideas suggested by the present
objects; there is a constant struggle between
these, and a quick and frequent variation of
thought. This is another cause of abruptness
and unconnectedness in the sentiments of a
person under the power of any passion; his
mind vibrates between conceptions suitable to
his passion and dissimilar conceptions arising
from different circumstances in his situation.
Moliere has represented this strongly in Har∣pagon;
however he is engaged, his avarice
makes the thought of the money which he
had hid in his garden, to intermix itself with
his present employment.</P>
<P>THOSE objects which are closely connected
with any passion, are likewise connected by
some of the associating qualities with other
objects, which therefore they have a natural
tendency to suggest. Now as it appears from
what has been said, that every passion exerts
itself in confining our thoughts to the objects
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
immediately connected with it, it would seem
to follow, that a passion must hinder these
from suggesting any other objects, however
nearly related to themselves, and thus to put
a stop to all succession of ideas. It has plainly
a tendency to this; and the tendency takes
effect in some degree. A passion never fails
to confine our attention very much to the ideas
which are most immediately related to itself.
But such is the constitution of the human
mind, that it cannot confine its attention
altogether to one unvaried object for any con∣siderable
time. The passions being opposed
by this law of our constitution, cannot keep
the mind long fixt on one view of the object
which it has first suggested. Yet it endea∣vours
to do so; and the first effect of the en∣deavour
is, that the mind averse from quitting
that object, turns it to every side, and views
it in various lights. In the following exam∣ple,
this effect appears very strikingly with
respect to the passion of love:</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as easy to count atoms as to re∣solve
the propositions of a lover<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>As you like it,</HI> act 3. scene 6</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<P>We have already discovered two sources of the
abruptness of thought occasioned by passion;
and we may now perceive another source of
it. Different views of the same object are
very unlike; a passion brings these different
views before the mind, in a rapid succession
and in an irregular groupe.</P>
<P>IN this way the passion prevents a change
of object for some time. But the different
views of the same object are not inexhaustible.
The passion therefore yielding to the impulse
of our constitution, allows the present object
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
to suggest ideas related to it. Hence it arises
that, under the influence of any passion, we
conceive not only the objects which are inti∣mately
related to it, but also such others as
are strongly connected with these by any of
the associating qualities. The former objects
would suggest these latter, if we were not
under the influence of any passion, these
therefore will occur more readily than any
others, when, notwithstanding the influence of
the passion, we must have some ideas on
which to employ our thoughts. Besides, an
idea connected with objects closely related to a
passion, may by its presence gratify the pass∣ion,
or support it, or fall in with it in other
ways; and in this case such an idea is often
suggested even when the mind is under no
necessity of being relieved from a conception
which has long occupied it. The Countess of
Rousillon parting with her son Bertram, who
is going to the army, the grief which this
produces, suggests to them both, an event
related by resemblance, and in some measure
also by causation, to the occasion of that grief;
the loss of her husband and his father:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>In delivering up my son from me,
I bury a second husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
<SPEAKER>Bertr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in going, Madam, I weep o'er
my father's death anew<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">All's well that ends well, <HI>act 1, scene 1.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<P>The mother does not say, the delivering up
of my son reminds me of my burying my
husband; she expresses it much more strong∣ly;
the son speaks in a manner equally for∣cible,
the imagination of both converts the
present event into the similar event suggested
by it. This figure is felt by every person to
be perfectly natural and proper; and its be∣ing
so, shows that, when an object strictly
connected with a passion introduces another
object associated with itself, the passion im∣pells
the mind to conceive this other object
very strongly, and to bestow upon it as inti∣mate
a relation to the passion, as possible.</P>
<P>BUT though a passion does not hinder an
object from suggesting others, it has a great
influence on the nature of the ideas suggested.
An object which has been brought into view
immediately by a passion, may be related, by
one or other of the associating qualities, to a
great multitude of ideas of very different
kinds: but it will not in this case introduce
any of these indiseriminately; the passion,
which brought itself into view, will direct it
to introduce such of these only as are suitable
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
to that passion. The perception present to
the mind, considered simply in itself, has an
equal fitness to bring into view any one of a
hundred ideas; but itself was introduced by
a passion which still continues to exert its
power, and indisposes the mind for thinking
on any thing unsuitable to it, and which thus
diverts the associating force of the present
perception from the direction it might have
otherwise taken, and leads the imagination to
select and take notice of only such ideas as
are suitable to the passion, as well as to the
present perception, overlooking many others
which are equally connected with the latter.
The associating forces of these two, have
some similitude to compound powers in me∣chanics,
which by their joint action produce
motion in a direction different from that in
which either acts, and lying between the se∣parate
directions of the two. Or, to set the
matter in a different light, those ideas which
are not only associated with the present per∣ception,
but also suitable to the passion that
introduced it, are dragged into the mind by
a double force; whereas the present percep∣tion
alone tends to draw in other ideas asso∣ciated
with it, and the passion opposes their
entrance, often with superior strength. The
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
latter cannot therefore fail to be neglected; the
former must be introduced in preference to them.
Thus, though a passion allows an object imme∣diately
connected with it, to introduce ideas, yet
it always moulds those which are introduced,
into its own likeness, or into a form agreeable
to itself, and it suffers none to enter which
are not susceptible of this form. When Alon∣zo's
companions are endeavouring to alleviate
his grief for the supposed loss of his son, by
diverting his thoughts to his daughter's mar∣riage
with the King of Tunis, in their return
from which they now suffered shipwreck, he
answers them,
<Q><L>You cram these words into mine ears against</L>
<L>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</L>
<L>Married my daughter there! for coming thence</L>
<L>My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,</L>
<L>Who is so far from Italy remov'd,</L>
<L>I ne'er again shall see her: O thou mine heir</L>
<L>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</L>
<L>Hath made his meal on thee?<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tempest,</HI> act 2. scene 1.</NOTE></L></Q>
This example illustrates and confirms almost
every observation we have had occasion to
make concerning the influence of the passions
upon association. His grief keeps his atten∣tion
fixt on the loss of his son, an object im∣mediately
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
connected with it as being its cause,
and that in spight of every thought by which
his companions endeavoured to divert it.
This object suggests an idea related to it by
causation, his daughter's marriage at Tunis,
the event which occasioned that loss. This
event carries his thoughts back again to the
death of his son; which, when thus again
presented to his imagination, suggests a se∣cond
time his daughter's marriage, by means
of its resemblance to it in one particular, that
her distance deprived him of all intercourse
with her, as much as if she too had been
dead. But sorrow for his son allows him not
to rest long upon this thought, suitable as it
is to his passion, or to pursue any others
which this might have introduced; it makes
his imagination instantly to recur to the loss
of his son, to view it in every light, to con∣ceive
many circumstances relating to him,
his being his heir, his being entitled to large
dominions, his being devoured by fishes.
This example is thus a new illustration of the
principles formerly explained, That a passion
tends to fix the view on objects intimately
connected with it, or to make it often recur
to them, not only on the slightest hint, but
even without any occasion, and that these
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
objects suggest ideas related to them. It is
likewise a direct illustration of the principle
now under consideration, and for the sake of
which we have cited it. It is a striking in∣stance
of the power of a passion to enable a
perception connected with it, to introduce not
indiscriminately any ideas related to itself,
but only such as are at the same time suitable
to the nature of the passion. No ideas are
conceived, but such as are perfectly suitable
to Alonzo's sorrow. Claribel's marriage was
in itself fully as fit for suggesting ideas of the
mirth or pomp which attended it, or of the
circumstances which rendered it desirable,
and moved Alonzo to urge it, as for suggesting
ideas of its disagreeable circumstances and
consequences. It had actually suggested ideas
of the former kind to the rest of the compa∣ny;
but Alonzo's sorrow hinders them from
occurring to him, and forces into his view
such thoughts as are unpleasant, and excite
regret.</P>
<P>FURTHER, a passion has an influence on
the <HI>number,</HI> as well as on the nature of the
ideas introduced. It tends so strongly to keep
the attention fixt on the objects strictly con∣nected
with it, that it suffers not these to sug∣gest
a long train of ideas, successively related
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
to each other. It generally allows us to go
only one step or two beyond them; after we
have been led by means of them to conceive
one idea, we go not forward to the view of
others associated with that; still the passion
makes the object nearly allied to it, to dwell
upon the thought; we recur to the contem∣plation
of this object, and it suggests a new
idea, related to itself but not to that idea
which it had introduced formerly. In other
cases, after the imagination has once received
an impulse, it readily goes on from one per∣ception
through a number of others, till it
arrive at a great distance from that with which
it began: and it would be difficult to stop its
career, to bring it back to the object from
which it set out, or to make it enter into a
different track. But when the mind is occu∣pied
by a passion, the difficulty lies wholly
on the other side; the passion directs the view
to things closely connected with it, so power∣fully
and so constantly, that the imagination
is drawn backward to repeated conceptions of
them: when our natural propensity to vary
the object of our thought, indisposes us for
dwelling longer on them alone, they yet re∣tain
their hold of us so far that we enter ea∣sily
into another track pointed out by them:
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
we cannot without a painful effort, often
we cannot at all, proceed so long in one path
as to leave them far behind us; all the ideas
introduced after a few removes, are but
slightly connected with the object which the
passion disposes us to rest upon, and that passion
checks all propensity to go through or attend
to many ideas but slightly connected. The
imagination resembles a person attached to
home, who cannot without reluctance under∣take
a long journey, but can with pleasure
make short excursions, returning home from
each, and thence setting out anew. Opposite
forces in mechanics tend to destroy one ano∣ther.
This is analogous to the case before us.
The objects strictly connected with a passion
are naturally fit for introducing ideas related
to themselves; the passion acts in a contrary
direction, and endeavours to keep the mind
from running off to these: there is a perpe∣tual
struggle between the two. The passion
having kept the attention fixt for some time
on an object intimately connected with it, its
force begins to flag: that object is conceived
in a lively and vigorous manner, by reason of
its relation to the passion, and therefore very
powerfully draws in ideas associated with it.
But the conception of all the succeeding ob∣jects
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
drawn in by it, is still weaker and
weaker; on this account their power of intro∣ducing
ideas becomes continually less and
less; so that after a few steps they give us a
very inconsiderable propensity to go forward.
The passion exerts a force superior to their's;
it therefore prevails, it prevents farther asso∣ciation,
it brings back the attention to some
object closely connected with it, it invigorates
the conception of that object so as to enable it
to suggest a new idea; but it hinders us from
going to a greater distance than before. Here
we discover a new cause of that abruptness of
thought which a passion occasions. It arises
partly, we have seen, from the mind's divid∣ing
its attention between several objects all
closely and almost equally connected with the
passion; partly from the rapidity with which
the mind takes in dissimilar views of any one
of these objects; and partly from the struggle
between objects suggested by the passion, and
objects suggested by other means: but it also
arises partly from the constant vibration of the
thought between the objects immediately con∣nected
with the passion, and the ideas which
they tend to introduce. The mind leaves
any of these ideas as soon as it has conceived
it, it lays hold of an object more closely con∣nected
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
with the passion, it runs from it to an
idea suggested by it, but wholly unrelated to
the former. This alone must produce a great
want of connexion, and many breaks, in the
expression of sentiments resulting from a pas∣sion.
These principles now laid down, are
sufficiently illustrated by the last example
which we cited. Alonzo's grief made the loss
of his son to suggest the distance of his daugh∣ter,
and the consequence of that distance, the
improbability of his ever seeing her; but
without allowing him to pursue that thought,
hurries him back to the loss of his son, and sets
him a thinking on new circumstances con∣nected
with it. The marriage of his daugh∣ter,
the loss of his son, the loss of his daughter,
her distance, the little chance for his seeing
her again, the loss of his son, his being heir
to extensive territories, his being devoured by
fishes, all succeed one another in his thoughts,
with great abruptness and rapidity.</P>
<P>THERE is a fault very common in drama∣tic
poetry: persons are made to express their
passions, not as if they were really actuated
by them, but as if they were spectators of
them in others; the poet gives not a natural
<HI>representation</HI> of the passion, but a laboured
<HI>description</HI> of it. The observations just now
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
made, lead us to a discovery of the source of
this fault. An object which is in a particular
instance strictly connected with a passion, and
forced into the mind by it, may be considered
not only in this particular point of view, but
also simply in itself, as a present perception.
Its influence on association is very different,
according as it stands in one of these situations
or the other. When it is in the mind simply
as a present perception, it tends to suggest
any ideas whatever that are connected with it
by any of the associating qualities, and to
cause the mind run from one of these through
a long train of ideas successively introducing
one another. But when it is brought into the
mind by a passion to which it is intimately
related, it receives a tincture from that pas∣sion,
it is wholly under the direction of that
passion, it exerts its power of association only
in such ways and so far as the passion permits,
it introduces such ideas alone as are suitable
to the passion, and it introduces no long
trains of ideas, but suffers the mind to return
quickly to the conception of itself, or of some
other object as intimately related to the passion.
For example, a person may think of the dis∣tress
of another without feeling pity: in this
case, the thought of that distress may lead
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
him to conceive any of the actions of the per∣son
who suffers it, any other persons who have
had a concern in these actions or a connexion
with the actor, any particulars of the conduct
or fortunes of these persons; and may thus
open a boundless field of thought. But when
the distress excites pity, this passion extin∣guishes
all propensity to such excursions, it
fixes our view on the distress by which it is
produced. This distress may suggest, by
means of resemblance, other instances of dis∣tress
in other persons; it may suggest, by
means of contrariety, such circumstances of
former prosperity, as aggravate the present
distress; it may lead us to think of the cause
of it, or to trace out its consequences; in a
word, it may introduce any ideas strictly con∣nected
with it, and congruous to the passion
of pity: but it has no tendency to suggest any
others, or to lead the imagination into a re∣mote
or extensive wandering. Did it attempt
this, and did the mind follow it without re∣serve,
it must quickly come to some ideas re∣pugnant
to the passion, and fit for producing
an opposite disposition: but this cannot na∣turally
or easily happen to a person under the
power of any passion. A passion leaves no
inclination for going through a long train of
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
ideas, and if the mind should run off to any
distance or to unsuitable ideas, the passion
would immediately check it, and recall the
attention to ideas congruous to itself, as well
as related to the object immediately suggested
by it. Now an indifferent poet having con∣ceived
some of the objects strictly connected
with a passion, considers that object only in
general, and abstractly as a present percep∣tion;
he therefore allows himself to run into
such a train of thought, as that object present
to the mind would dictate, if it were uncon∣nected
with any passion; he goes on coolly
imagining such ideas as it suggests by means
of any of the principles of association; and he
makes the person possessed by the passion, to
express all these ideas. He feels not the pas∣sion,
he has not force of genius or sensibility
of heart sufficient for conceiving how it would
affect a person who felt it, or for entering
into the sentiments which it would produce
in him. The sentiments which he makes him
utter, might all be very proper in a descrip∣tion,
a discourse, or a meditation, occasioned
by the view of such an object; but they are
not natural to a person in whom that object
produces a suitable passion. In order to con∣ceive
sentiments natural to him, the poet ought
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
to have consined himself to the consideration
of the object in this one point of view, as
strictly connected with a passion and suggested
by it; he ought to indulge only such a train
of thought, as it would lead to in these cir∣cumstances,
or such a train as the passion with
which it is presently connected, would intro∣duce
into the mind of a person under the
power of that passion.</P>
<P>This is indeed so difficult, that the best poets
cannot always perfectly attain it. Shakespear
makes the dutchess of Gloucester, in parting
with John of Gaunt, to express her grief in
this manner:
<Q><L>Yet one word more; grief boundeth where it falls,</L>
<L>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:</L>
<L>I take my leave before I have begun;</L>
<L>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</L>
<L>Commend me to my brother, Edmund York;</L>
<L>Lo, this is all—nay yet depart not so;</L>
<L>Though this be all, do not so quickly go:</L>
<L>I shall remember more. Bid him—oh what?</L>
<L>With all good speed at Plashie visit me.</L>
<L>Alack, and what shall good old York see there,</L>
<L>But empty lodgings, and unfurnish'd walls,</L>
<L>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</L>
<L>And what hear there for welcome, but my groans?</L>
<L>Therefore commend me,—let him not come there</L>
<L>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where;</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="181"/>
All desolate will I from hence, and die;</L>
<L>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Richard</HI> II. act 1. scene 3.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The latter part of the speech is a natural ex∣pression
of grief, and of violent grief; the
first four lines are a description, not an exs∣pression
of it, and therefore unsuitable to the
dutchess's state of mind; the reflection which
they contain is just, but too cool for the tem∣per
of the speaker.</P>
<P>IT follows from the observations which have
been made, that a passion tends to hinder the
mind from running into the conception of
such ideas as have no connexion with that
passion. Since a passion fixes the view on ob∣jects
immediately connected with it, since it
continually draws the mind back to the con∣ception
of these objects even from ideas sug∣gested
by themselves, since it prevents their
introducing many ideas naturally connected
with them, the necessary consequence is, that
it will much more exclude ideas which have
no relation either to these objects or to the
passion, and will render a very strong effort
requisite for bringing them into view. A di∣rect
proof of this arises from the difficulty
which we experience in diverting any passion
which has taken firm possion of the soul, by
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
application to such subjects as have a tendency
to banish it: the strongest resolution and the in∣tensest
endeavours are often insufficient for
bringing the mind to fix on these subjects.
Nay, so great is the force of the passion, that
when other subjects are most powerfully urged
upon us, when we have the strongest calls to
give application to them, yet we cannot enter
into them with spirit; the passion mixes with
all our thoughts, and continually disturbs the
course of them.</P>
<P>IT often happens that two different passions,
or that a present passion and an habitual dis∣position,
occupy the mind together. Each of
these having a tendency to fix the mind on
objects strictly connected with itself, or to di∣rect
it to such ideas as these objects suggest,
the mind turns quickly from thoughts intro∣duced
by the one passion, to those which are
introduced by the other, and runs constantly
backward and forward between them, with∣out
resting a moment on either. In this case,
the thoughts must have an uncommon degree
of abruptness: each of the passions singly
would have occasioned abruptness in the ways
already taken notice of; but to this is super∣added
the unconnectedness which arises from
the view being successively directed to objects
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
associated with different passions. Shakespear
affords us a striking instance of this, when he
represents Shylock agitated by avarice, by
grief for the loss of his daughter, and by rage
at her having married a Christian and stolen
his money, and in consequence of that agita∣tion
exclaiming,
<Q><L>My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!</L>
<L>Fled with a Christian? O my christian ducats!</L>
<L>Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter!</L>
<L>A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,</L>
<L>Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!</L>
<L>And jewels, two stones, rich and precious stones,</L>
<L>Stol'n by my daughter! justice! find the girl;</L>
<L>She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats!<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Merchant of Venice, <HI>act</HI> 2. <HI>scene</HI> 9.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>IT was evinced, that <HI>habit</HI> not only pro∣motes
the introduction of such ideas as it has
rendered familiar, but also gives the mind, in
some cases, a propensity to associate ideas by
one relation rather than by others. It does
not appear that <HI>the passions</HI> give an absolute
preference to any one relation. An object
immediately connected with a passion, suggests
indiscriminately ideas connected with itself by
any of the associating qualities. Some of
these qualities may, however, be considered as
in some sense more suitable to the passions than
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
others; and that in two respects: a passion
introduces ideas connected with its immediate
objects by some of the associating qualities,
more commonly and frequently than such as
are connected with them by other associating
qualities: and some of the associating quali∣ties
lead the mind to a greater distance from
the objects strictly connected with the passion,
than others of them. Ideas introduced by
some associating qualities, have a less perfect
relation to the passion, than ideas introduced
by others: the former ideas are rarely sug∣gested
by a passion, the latter often: the qua∣lities
which give ideas introduced by them but
an imperfect relation, scarce ever lead the
mind more than one step beyond the objects
strctly connected with the passion; the others
may lead it several steps, introducing a series
of ideas successively associated with one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>RESEMBLANCE is a quality of the former
kind: there are many ways in which ideas
may resemble an object intimately connected
with a passion, that will not lead that object
to suggest these ideas. The resemblance must
be of a peculiar kind, must be such as fits an
idea to affect the passion in the same way
with the object which suggests it, else the pas∣sion
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
will check its operation. When the re∣semblance
is thus peculiar, the association is
indeed very strong; there are few ideas which
occur more readily either to a person suffering
any distress, or to aspectator moved with pity
for his suffering, than the idea of a similar
distress. But other sorts of resemblance have
no such effect: hence it is universally allowed,
that similitudes are in general unsuitable to
the language of passion, and that even me∣taphors
ought to be admitted into it with
great reserve. In this respect, what Shakes∣pear
puts into the mouth of the queen, when
she sees her husband king Richard a prisoner,
is faulty and unnatural;
<Q><L>But soft, but see, or rather do not see,</L>
<L>My fair rose wither; yet look up; behold,</L>
<L>That you in pity may dissolve to dew,</L>
<L>And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.</L>
<L>O thou the model where old Troy did stand,</L>
<L>Thou map of honour, thou king Richard's tomb,</L>
<L>And not king Richard; thou most beauteous inn,</L>
<L>Why should hard favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee,</L>
<L>When triumph is become an ale-house guest?<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Richard II. <HI>act</HI> 5. <HI>scene</HI> 1.</NOTE></L></Q>
Besides, resemblance leads the mind only one
step; an idea suggested by means of its re∣semblance
to any of the objects strictly con∣nected
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
with a passion, seldom suggests another
idea resembling itself. A passion occupies the
mind too much, to leave it leisure or inclina∣tion
for hunting after similitudes. One re∣sembling
idea is often suitable to the passion,
and fit to influence it; but by conceiving ano∣ther
idea resembling that, much more by go∣ing
through several ideas, each of which is
suggested by its resemblance to the preceding,
we must come to such as are no ways related
to the passion, as are wholly unfit for influ∣encing
it, and as bear no likeness to any of
the objects closely connected with it. But the
nature of passion permits us not to indulge
ourselves in the conception of such ideas.
Richard giving vent to his grief in prison,
might naturally say, on hearing time broke
in music,
<Q><L>And here have I the daintiness of ear,</L>
<L>To check time broke in a disorder'd string;</L>
<L>But for the concord of my state and time,</L>
<L>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke:</L>
<L>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me.</L></Q>
But he could scarce naturally add,
<Q><L>For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:</L>
<L>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</L>
<L>Their watches to mine eyes the outward watch;</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="187"/>
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</L>
<L>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Richard II. <HI>act</HI> 5. <HI>scene</HI> 10.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>OBJECTS strictly connected with a passion,
often suggest <HI>contrary</HI> objects; but they sug∣gest
only such as are contrary in some particu∣lar
ways, which render them fit for influen∣cing
the present passion: objects in all other
ways contrary, the passion leads the mind to
reject.</P>

<P>Contrariety seldom leads the mind more than
one step from the object immediately sug∣gested
by the passion: a short contrast may
very much enliven our conception of that ob∣ject;
it thus naturally falls in with the passion:
but a series of contrasts would produce a very
different effect; a multitude of antitheses in
writing of any sort, show an imagination dis∣posed
to seek amusement, not a mind intensely
engaged by its subject.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188"/>
OBJECTS strictly connected with a passion,
often suggest likewise the ideas of other ob∣jects
associated with them by <HI>vicinity.</HI> In∣deed
contiguous objects are frequently con∣nected
together by other relations, and in that
case a passion leads us strongly to conceive
them. But vicinity alone is sufficient for
producing this effect: a view of the contigu∣ous
objects renders our conception of a thing
determinate and lively, and thus when that
thing is intimately related to a passion, tends
to invigorate and support the passion. A pas∣sion
makes us prone to this, and naturally
assists vicinity in introducing such ideas as
can promote it. But vicinity never intro∣duces
a long train of ideas: it would be un∣natural
for a person actuated by any passion,
to run along a multitude of objects contigu∣ous
to one another either in place or in time,
for this would tend to divert the passion by
variety.</P>
<P>CO-EXISTENCE and the relation of <HI>cause
and effect,</HI> are the principles of association
which the passions employ most frequently,
and which suggest the longest trains of ideas.
These give ideas the most perfect relation to
a passion; and almost every idea introduced
by means of these principles, really influences
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
the passion. Co-existence suggests the quali∣ties,
the circumstances, the acoessories, and
the concomitants of those objects which are
closely connected with the passion; and the
more of these we have in our view, the stronger
and livelier is our conception of those objects.
All the objects almost which the relation of
cause and effect can suggest, contribute either
more immediately or more remotely to the
production of the passion itself; and therefore
are strongly connected with it. Accordingly,
in most of the examples which have been
produced, the ideas suggested by objects strictly
connected with the passions, are such as are
suggested by means of these two principles of
association.</P>
<P>IT is a natural inference from the obser∣vations
which have been already made, that
the passions, far from disposing us to follow
order in the train of our ideas, render us in∣capable
of preserving order. The inference
is so obvious, that it is not necessary to spend
time in confirming it. Abruptness, incohe∣rence,
fluctuation of thought, are the conse∣quences
of passion; and these are the re∣verse
of order. But it is worth while to ob∣serve,
that a passion even inverts the natural
order of our ideas. As the imagination passes
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
from one idea to another connected with it,
so a passion once excited does not confine
itself to its first object, but readily extends it∣self
to other objects connected with that; love
or hatred to any person, seldom fails to pro∣duce
some degree of love or hatred to such as
are connected with him. It has been shown
by philosophers, that the imagination passes
most readily from a less considerable to a more
considerable object; but that a passion, on the
contrary, passes with greatest ease from the
more to the less considerable object<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Treatise of Human Nature, Vol. II. Part ii. Sect. 2.</NOTE>: and
what we would now observe is, that a passion
prevailing in the mind, causes the imagina∣tion
to proceed in this latter direction. In∣deed
if it did not, the passion itself could not
be extended to the inferior and subordinate
objects; for it cannot be directed to them till
we have formed ideas of them. When the
mind is cool, and not under the influence of
any passion, the idea of a son or of a servant
suggests the idea of the father or the master,
more naturally and more certainly than the
idea of the father or the master would sug∣gest
that of the son or the servant. On the
contrary, love, hatred, resentment, towards a
father or a master, very readily extend them∣selves
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
to the son or the servant, though we
might feel the same passions towards these
latter, without conceiving any degree of them
towards the former. At the same time the
passion towards the superior, gives the imagi∣nation
an irresistible propensity to run into
the conception of the inferior or dependent:
eager to extend itself, it forces upon us the
idea without which it could not be extended.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reflections on the Principles of Association.
Ideas suggested either by Sensations, or by
other Ideas.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the account which has been al∣ready
given of the principles of associ∣ation
it is easy to collect, That there is a
broad foundation laid in the nature of the
human imagination, for great extent and va∣ricty
of genius. There are many relations of
ideas, which fit them for being associated;
almost every perception bears some of these
relations to many different ideas; habit and
the passions multiply and vary the instru∣ments
of association: by these means there
are innumerable handles by which the imagi∣nation
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
may seize such ideas as it has occasion
for. Genius has, in some men, great force
and compass: but a vigorous construction of
the associating principles is sufficient to account
for it, however great it be; for if they be vi∣gorous,
any one perception may introduce a
great multitude of others, and that by means
of many different relations. The principles
of association likewise being so various, can∣not
but admit many distinct combinations and
modifications, by which genius will be mould∣ed
into a great diversity of forms. In order
therefore to prepare the way for a discovery
of the varieties of genius, it will be proper to
make some reflections on the principles of
association, which have been separately illus∣trated</P>
<P>THE present perception which introduces
others, by means of the relations that they
bear to it, may be either a sensation of an
object, or only an idea of it. In whichever
of these ways the object be perceived, it has
the very same relations to others; and there∣fore
in both cases it has a tendency to suggest
the very same ideas. But it will not always
suggest them with the same force or certainty
in these two cases.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193"/>
THAT a perception may introduce others,
it is necessary that itself take some hold of the
mind, and be attended to; and the stronger a
perception is, it takes the firmer hold of the
mind, and excites the closer attention. The
actual sensation of an object is always much
stronger than any conception of it, which
memory or imagination can exhibit. On this
account, a sensation of an object will often
introduce ideas which the mere conception of
that object would not have force to suggest;
it gives a stronger impulse to the mind, and
renders less intimate relations to the present
object, sufficient for bringing these ideas into
view. Merely to think of darkness, does not
lead us so readily or so necessarily to the con∣ception
of its opposite, light, as our being
actually involved in darkness. The sight of
a ship perishing in a storm, not only raises
stronger emotions, but likewise introduces a
much greater variety of ideas into the mind,
than barely reading or hearing of a ship∣wre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k:
in the latter case, it sometimes makes
so little impression upon us, as not to give
rise to any train of ideas. The mention or
the accidental recollection of a place where we
have spent a considerable part of our lives,
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
will bring to mind occurrences which hap∣pened
there; but every person has felt, that
visiting that place reminds him of many
more, and makes them rush into his thoughts
with much greater rapidity. The mention
of a person often makes us recollect that there
is some purpose for which we want to see
him; but sometimes, when we cannot call to
mind what it particularly is, the sight of
that person brings it quickly into our thoughts.
In consequence of the superior force of sensa∣tions
which enables them to suggest concep∣tions
by means of much weaker relations
than ideas can, it often happens, that an ob∣ject
occurring to the senses, gives a very quick,
and seemingly unaccountable turn to the course
of the thoughts. It makes a man cease to
pursue a train of sentiments connected with
his former ideas by the strongest relations,
and run into such as are much more weakly
related to the object which he perceives by
sense.</P>
<P>BUT, on the other hand, there are cases in
which the idea of an object will suggest such
thoughts as the sensation of that object could
not have suggested. This happens chiestly
when objects are of such a nature, that the
sensation of them is exceeding strong and in∣terests
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
us very deeply, when, for instance, it
is in a high degree pleasant or painful, or
when it produces any strong or violent pas∣sion.
In these cases, it engrosses our whole
attention, and by doing so, prevents ideas
from occurring, which would have been na∣tually
suggested by a mere idea of that object
because the idea would not have occupied the
mind so much. Many of the observations
which we have already made concerning the
passions, may be easily applied to the illustra∣tion
of this postion. To confirm it by a
separate example, relations of tortures some∣times
suggest a variety of conceptions of different
kinds; but it is remarked, that the
sight of tortures chills the whole soul, and
produces almost a total stagnation of thought.</P>
<P>A PERSON has always sensations of those
objects which belong to his own state and
condition; others, who observe his situation,
conceive the same objects only in idea. Hence
there arises often a great difference between
the train of thoughts which are raised in a
person by the sense of his own situation, and
that train which observation of his situation
introduces into the minds of others. The
thoughts, reflections, and sentiments of a
person who actually feels pain or sickness, are
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
generally different in several respects, from
those of the persons who visit him; these often
engage in conversation, even relating to his
distress, into which he can by no means enter.
Suppose a person raised from meanness to
great prosperity or dignity; his own senti∣ments
are very unlike to the reflections of
spectators. The vivacity with which he per∣ceives
it, the force with which it lays hold of
him by means of the senses, leads him into
many thoughts which the idea of it has not
power enough to suggest to others. But at
the same time it scarce at all leads him to
think of some things which most readily occur
to the rest of the world. The contrast be∣tween
his present and his former situation, is
one of the first and most natural reflections
that the world makes: but there are many
reflections into which the man himself runs
more easily and more frequently. His pre∣sent
situation makes so strong an impression
on him, that he attends chieftly to such ideas
as are suitable to it; it excites many agree∣able
passions, these increase his propensity to
attend only to agreeable perceptions: his for∣mer
meanness is in the main mortifying, and
therefore the whole of his temper opposes his
running into the contemplation of it. Many
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
regard both the present and the past state of
another with great indifference; neither af∣fects
them much, neither raises any passion;
they consider both without any emotion,
merely as objects exposed to their view: these
objects can suggest ideas to them, only by
their natural relations to other objects; and
therefore they run freely into whatever
thoughts these relations suggest: contrariety
is one of these relations; its force is the
greater in this case, because the opposite con∣ditions
belong to the same person; and by
means of it, the man's former condition is
readily brought into view. Some again ob∣serve
such a change of fortune happening to
another, not without some emotion. When∣ever
for instance, the idea of it occurs to one
person, it is attended with envy, and this
passion augments its power to suggest his for∣mer
meanness, and turns it when it is sug∣gested,
into such a form as makes it seem to
fully or obscure his present elevation. On
the contrary, in the mind of the benevolent,
such good fortune produces joy; the person's
former obscurity, by rendering the good for∣tune
the greater, tends to support and raise
that joy, and therefore finds ready access to
the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198"/>
IN a word, the train of sentiments intro∣duced
by an object, varies considerably accord∣ing
as a person has himself a sensation of that
object, or only observes one who has; and
that both because the immediate effect of
<HI>sensations</HI> on association, are different in many
respects from those of <HI>ideas,</HI> and because they
give rise to different passions and emotions.
Every one who would give a natural repre∣sentation
of thoughts and sentiments, must
attend to this principle: it has therefore a
near relation to every species of genius which
is conversant about characters. It has likewise
a more extensive influence upon genius: sen∣timents
suggested by a man's own situation,
mix with all the exertions of his genius, on
whatever subjects it be employed; and his
situation thus gives it some peculiarity, and
distinguishes his productions from those of
another man possessed of the most similar ge∣nius,
but placed in dissimilar circumstances.</P>
<P>THUS association is susceptible of great va∣rieties
according as it is produced by a sensa∣tion
or by an idea: it is likewise susceptible
of varieties arising from other causes, which
we shall next proceed to consider.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Combination of the associating Prin∣ciples.</HEAD>
<P>THE several principles of association
which have been enumerated, are dif∣ferent,
and some of them are very unlike to
others of them: every perception whatever is
connected with some ideas by some of these
principles, and with some ideas by other prin∣ciples;
but often also a perception is connect∣ed
with another by two or more of these
principles at once.</P>
<P>IT was impossible to consider the associat∣ing
principles so much separately, as to pre∣vent
many instances of this combination from
occurring in what has been already said, or
to avoid mentioning some of the consequences

of passion concurring with some of the rela∣tions
of ideas, in suggesting the same thought.
Different relations of ideas may be combined
in like manner. A thing which resembles
another, may at the same time be contiguous
to it, or be its cause, or its effect. Morton,

The several images here employed; <HI>steel
losing its temper; heavy things moving faster
than light things, when they are projected
with sufficient force; arrows flying to a mark;</HI>
have such a degree of resemblance to the de∣jection
and flight of brave soldiers, as is suffi∣cient
to render them proper similitudes: but
in this case, they are not suggested to the
poet by resemblance alone; being things em∣ployed
in war, they have all a kind of vici∣nity
to what happened in the field of battle;
the use that is made of them in war, connects
them with it by a species of causation; and
therefore they have a stronger relation to the
subject described, than images which only re∣semble
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
it, though in the most perfect man∣ner.
The power of these complicated rela∣tions
has hurried on the poet to pursue and to
accumulate the images, more than is consist∣ent
with perfect simplicity and correctness.
Justin was led by the same co-operation of
principles, to the choice of the similitude by
which he illustrates the effect of the death of
Epaminondas, on the spirit of the Thebans,
a similitude too remote to have otherwise
come into his mind: “For as, if you break
off the point of a weapon, you take from
the rest of the iron the power of hurting,
so that General of the Thebans, being taken
away, like the point of the weapon, the
power also of the state was deadened<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nam sicuti telo si primam aciem praefregeris, reliquo ferro vim nocendi sustuleris; sic illo, velut mucrone teli, ab∣lato duce Thebanorum, rei quoque publicae virea he∣betatae sunt. <HI>Hist.</HI> lib. vi. cap. 8.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is not necessary to multiply examples of
the combination of different associating quali∣ties;
to conceive this, is not a matter of any
difficulty. But it will be proper to make an
observation which serves to render some of our
former conclusions more precise and determi∣nate.
We could scarce avoid mentioning
<HI>contrariety</HI> as an associating quality, because
it sometimes connects ideas by itself, and be∣cause
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
often when it is assisted by other rela∣tions,
it is notwithstanding the chief and
prevalent relation. But from a review of the
examples which were given, it will appear,
that for the most part, when contrariety
unites ideas, it is combined with some other
relation. One thing, for instance, suggests
its contrary when both belong to the same
subject, in many cases where it would not
suggest it, if they belonged to different sub∣jects.
It is when opposite fortunes happen
by a remarkable reverse, to the same person,
that they irresistibly suggest each other.</P>
<P>ONE effect of the combination of different
associating principles, has been often hinted at
already. That combination produces a closer
and stronger relation between perceptions, than
either of the principles alone: one of the
perceptions introduces the other with a double
force, and therefore in preference to those
which are connected with it only by a single
tie.</P>
<P>THIS combination likewise contributes
greatly to the <HI>force</HI> and extent of genius.
It supplies the imagination with many means
of apprehending the conceptions for which it
has occasion. If a person be not affected by
one of the relations which subsist between a
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
prsent perception and an idea which suits his
purpose, he may be affected by another of
them. If neither of the relations singly have
force enough to operate upon his imagina∣tion,
they may derive sufficient force from
their union, and be able together to lead him
readily to the discovery of such apposite ma∣terials
as otherwise he must have missed.</P>
<P>THIS combination contributes not only to
increase the force of genius, but also to diver∣sisy
its <HI>form.</HI> The separate principles of asso∣ciation
being so numerous as they are, must
be susceptible of an almost infinite number of
combinations; and every possible combina∣tion
of them constitutes a new ground of
union among perceptions, which will be sub∣servient
to genius. Any present perception
will suggest a thousand different ideas to as
many different persons, according to the dif∣ferent
associating principles or combinations
of principles by which they are affected;
and this will produce a correspondent diver∣sity
both in the substance and in the structure
of their works.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Modifications of the associating Prin∣ciples.</HEAD>
<P>AS the principles of association may be
combined with endless variety, so each
principle is susceptible of different forms or
modifications. This was hinted before; it
will now be proper to explain it.</P>
<P>VICINITY admits degrees; for objects do
not suggest those only which are properly
contiguous; but it admits not any diversity
in kind, except what was already taken no∣tice
of, that it may be referred either to place
or to time. But all the other principles of
association are susceptible of much greater
varieties.</P>
<P>RESEMBLANCE not only takes place in
different <HI>degrees,</HI> but also is of different
<HI>kinds.</HI> The difference is only in degree, when
the same quality of an object is the ground of
its resemblance to several different things:
one thing may resemble several others, in co∣lour,
suppose; but resembles them more or
less, according to the different shades of that
colour, which belong to them. Again, the
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
difference is only in degree, when it arises
from things possessing the same qualities in
common, but possessing more or fewer of
them. One quality common to two objects,
forms a real resemblance between them; but
the resemblance is much more perfect when
they have several common qualities: all ani∣mals,
or all vegetables, have some degree of
resemblance; animals or vegetables of the
same class, have a greater resemblance; those
of the same genus, still a greater; the indi∣viduals
of the same species, yet a greater;
and some of the individuals have a much more
perfect resemblance than others.</P>
<P>BUT farther, one thing may resemble several
others, by means of its different qualities; it
may resemble some by its colour, others by its
smell, others by its figure, others by its size:
each of these forms a different kind of resem∣blance;
for neither the qualities themselves,
nor the similitudes arising from them, can
admit comparison in respect of degree. Hence
any one thing is capable of as many sorts of
resemblance to other things, as it possesses
distinct qualities. It is capable of many
more.</P>
<P>IT not only resembles some things by its
particular, definite, constituent qualities, as
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
in the instances already given: it may re∣semble
other things by some general charac∣ter
belonging to some of its qualities. Sweet∣ness
originally and properly belongs to tastes;
but in a figurative sense we speak of sweet
colours, sweet sounds, sweet dispositions; we
intend to express some character common to
these distinct qualities, which produces a re∣semblance
among them, so obvious that it has
rendered the figure ordinary in all languages,
if not strictly universal.</P>
<P>A THING may likewise resemble others, by
a sort of general appearance resulting from
all its qualities, or from several of them. Of
this kind are the general likenesses which are
often observed between the faces and the airs
of different persons.</P>
<P>IT may resemble other things, by bearing
the same relation to some object, which they
bear to the same object, or even to kindred
objects, nay to objects in no way connected;
by proceeding from the same cause, or by
proceeding from a similar cause, or by pro∣ceeding
from a totally different cause in a
somewhat similar manner; or by producing
similar effects, or by producing its peculiar
effects in a similar manner. Resemblances of
this sort, however slight or remote they may
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
be thought at first sight, are so close and just,
that they are sufficient for producing a tran∣sition
from one object to another, which can∣not
be reckoned unnatural, even when a per∣son
is under the influence of a passion: Bassanio
overjoyed at Portia's having accepted his love,
says,
<Q><L>Madam, you have berest me of all words,</L>
<L>Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;</L>
<L>And there is such confusion in my pow'rs,</L>
<L>As, after some oration fairly spoke</L>
<L>By a beloved Prince, there doth appear</L>
<L>Among the buzzing, pleased multitude,</L>
<L>Where every something being blent together,</L>
<L>Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy</L>
<L>Exprest, and not exprest.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Merchant of Venice,</HI> act 3. scene 2.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The cause of his joy is compared to what
resembles it in no respect except in pro∣ducing
a similar effect upon the mind, a like
confused sensation of joy. If that comparison
should by any be thought not entirely natural
in a person's expression of his own passion,
yet it will be acknowledged by all, that in a
description of that passion, the comparison
would be unexceptionable; and this is a suffi∣cient
proof, that the resemblance is a proper
ground of association. The justiness of these
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
sorts of resemblance appears farther from this,
that they have given rise to comparisons and
metaphors which show themselves to be natu∣tral
by being adopted in all ages and nations:
it is in some of the indirect ways now men∣tioned,
that light resembles knowlege, joy,
goodness, and perfection; yet light is one of
the most beautiful and natural emblems of all
these. The resemblance which takes place
between simple perceptions of the same class,
between different smells, for instance, seems
to belong to some of the kinds now under
consideration. Simple perceptions being void
of composition, can scarce have some qualities
in common, and other qualities which distin∣guish
them; our notion of their resemblance
must proceed from their affecting the mind in
ways, the similarity of which we perceive,
though we cannot perhaps explain it, or from
our presuming that they proceed from causes
somehow closely related.</P>
<P>IN a word, there is no quality, no relation,
no action of an object, no point of view in
which we can consider it, but may be the foun∣dation
of a resemblance between it and some
other. The resemblance is often of a very
delicate nature, and yet very obvious and
strong; we readily feel it, but sometimes we
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
can scarce at all define whence it arises, or of
what kind it is.</P>
<P>CONTRARIETY, in the extent in which it is
generally understood, and in which it pro∣motes
association, is reducible to several dif∣ferent
species. By contrariety is sometimes
meant only great diversity, dissimilitude or
distance; as when bitter is said to be contrary
to sweet; and in this sense it admits many
degrees. In another sense, objects are called
contrary, when one is only the negation or
absence of the other; thus darkness and light,
health and sickness, are contraries<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cicero takes notice of these two kinds, though under different names; Contrarium est, quod positum in genere di∣verso, ab eodem cui contrarium esse dicitur, plurimum distat, ut frigus calori, vitae mors. Disparatum autem est id, quod ab aliqua re per oppositionem negationis separatur, hoc modo, sapere et non sapere. <HI>De Invent.</HI> Lib. 1. But the examples which he gives are not apposite, except in the mere expression.</NOTE>. Other
objects are contraries in a still more proper
sense, as pleasure and pain, hope and fear, love
and hatred. Very often the two former of
these kinds of contrariety, and sometimes all
the three, run into one another by an easy
gradation: rich and poor are terms of contra∣riety,
but they express, at different times, all
the three species of contrariety; poverty some∣times
signifies only a very inferior degree of
riches, and then the contrariety is of the first
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
kind; sometimes it denotes total indigence,
in which case the contrariety is of the second
kind; but if the person to whose condition
the word is applied be in debt, the contrariety
is of the third kind.</P>
<P>OBJECTS which, considered simply in them∣selves,
could not be reckoned contraries, yet
come to be regarded as such, when either
their causes or their effects are contrary in any
of the senses that have been mentioned. Heat
and cold are perhaps termed contraries, ra∣ther
on account of the contrariety of their
causes and of their effects, than of any oppo∣sition
between the two sensations themselves.
Acids and alkalis, astringents and laxatives,
septics and antiseptics, are denominated con∣traries,
merely on account of the contrariety
of some of their effects.</P>
<P>OF <HI>co-existence</HI> also there are many different
modifications. Those qualities which are
united in any natural whole or individual, are
in the properest sense co-existent; yet they
are not all co-existent in precisely the same
degree or manner. The qualities which are
common to one individual with several others,
which together form the character of the spe∣cies,
and would be enumerated in a just defi∣nition
of it, seem to have a co-existence some∣what
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
what different from those which are peculiar
to one or a few individuals. These two sorts
of qualities influence association differently:
a quality of the former sort most readily sug∣gests
the idea of the species; one of the latter
sort, the idea of the individual. Some qua∣lities
of the latter sort are permanent in the
individual; others are temporary: these are,
at a particular time, really as inseparable from
it, as those are; yet they can scarce be con∣sidered
as belonging to it by a co-existence
equally close, though it is so strong as very
readily to produce association.</P>
<P>NOT only the essential qualities of a thing,
but circumstances also which are not con∣sidered
as entering into its substance, may
acquire a sort of co-existence with it, which
shall act very powerfully on the imagination.
Thus whatever belongs to the condition of a
person, his possessions, his prospects, all by
which he is distinguished from others, all that
can render the conception of him more deter∣minate
or more striking, acquire a connexion
with him, which produces association. Nay,
things which have belonged to the state of the
same person at different times, as poverty and
riches, meanness and elevation, acquire, by
means of their relation to him, a connexion
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
with one another, which there would be an
apparent impropriety in terming co-existence,
but which affects the imagination in a man∣ner
perfectly analogous. Whatever is closely
or long connected with a thing, as an adjunct,
or a concomitant, or belongs to it in any way,
comes naturally to be considered as in some
sense co-existent with it, and they will suggest
one another. If we have seen a person at
any one time in a remarkable attitude, or
situation, or dress, we can scarce ever think
of him without conceiving it also. On the
other hand, a garment, a ring, the most tri∣fling
piece of dress, will produce a lively con∣ception
of the person to whom it belonged.
Ovid gives us a natural picture of this in
Pyramus:
<Q><L>—Ut vero vestem quoque sanguine tinctam</L>
<L>Repperit; una duos nox, inquit, perdet amantes;</L>
<L>E quibus illa fuit longa dignissima vita.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Metamorph.</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>SEVERAL distinct substances are often com∣bined
into a system; and in that case they are
considered as parts of one whole, and are
united in the imagination by the principle of
co-existence. An army, a nation, a church,
is a whole, including several individuals, in a
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
manner similar to that in which an individual
includes many different qualities.</P>
<P>WHAT we have said, does not perhaps
amount to a complete enumeration of all the
forms which co-existence assumes; but it suf∣ficiently
evinces that this relation does assume
a very great variety of forms.</P>
<P>IT would not be easy to pursue the relation
of <HI>cause</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> through all the forms in
which it operates on the imagination; but
many of the principal ones are very obvious.
What gives existence to any thing, what makes
any change in it, what influences any of its
powers or virtues, what contributes to its pre∣servation,
or to its destruction, a mean for
answering any end, an argument for proving
any conclusion, a proposition from which a
corollary may be deduced, a motive to any sort
of conduct; all these are called causes, but
plainly in very different senses; and they all
are, in the imagination, associated with their
several effects or consequences. In the ex∣amples
which we have had occasion to pro∣duce,
most of these modifications of causation
have occurred. This relation makes a per∣ception
of the cause, or of the effect, to in∣troduce
the idea of its correlative, whether
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
the effect be a substance or a mode, whether
the cause give existence to the effect, or only
alter it, or in any way affect it, or have a
power of affecting it. But the relation has
greatest force when it is most perfect: a ser∣vant
will not so readily suggest the idea of
his master, as a son that of his father.</P>
<P>OBJECTS may be connected as cause and
effect, when one of them does not immedi∣ately
produce or influence the other. What
is, in any of the senses now mentioned, a
cause, is connected not only with its imme∣diate
effects, but also with the remotest effects
of any thing produced or affected by it. In
a series of things where each is the imme∣diate
cause of what succeeds it, the last effect
really-depends upon the first cause. Some∣times
we are ignorant of many of the inter∣mediate
steps, and regard that as the nearest,
which is only a remote cause: an ordinary
man reckons the motion of his hand the im∣mediate
effect of his volition, because he knows
nothing of the muscles by which his hand is
moved. But even when we are acquainted
with the whole chain of causes and effects,
the effect will sometimes suggest a remote
cause, without our ever thinking of the inter∣vening
links; or the remote cause will di∣rectly
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
introduce the idea of the effect which
springs from it by the mediation of many sub∣ordinate
causes, while to these we do not at
all attend. Thus when there has been one
among a person's ancestors very eminent,
though at a great distance of time, it is natu∣ral
both for the person himself and for others
to direct their thoughts to that one. Horace
in addressing his patron, mentions not his fa∣ther,
but much remoter ancestors;
<Q><L>Maecenas, atavis edite regibus.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. Od. 1.</NOTE></L>
<L>Tyrrhena regum progenies.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lib. III&gt; Od. 29.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>This principle is sometimes so powerful, that
a person finds himself disposed to give a fa∣mily,
or even a nation, a name formed from
that of their founder, many ages after his
death. Such is the epithet which Virgil gives
his countrymen long after the time of Romulus;
<Q><L>—Subitoque novum consurgere bellum
Romulidis.—<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aeneid.</HI> Lib. VIII.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>As the same cause sometimes produces many
different effects, all these effects, however dis∣similar,
are connected with one another by
means of their relation to the common cause,
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
and by virtue of this connexion one of the
effects will lead us to think of the other. Heat
and light are both effects of fire; and one
of them being perceived, naturally suggests
the other. Sometimes one effect suggests the
idea of the cause, and this introduces the idea
of the other effect. The sight of a son will
lead us to think of the father, and the thought
of him will introduce a discourse or enquiry
concerning his other children. Sometimes
again one effect will introduce the idea of
another effect, without first suggesting the
idea of their common cause. The sight of a
person may dispose us to think of a brother,
without our once thinking of the parents, by
means of whom they are related to each other.
In this case, it seems to be a species of resem∣blance
that produces the association; the two
effects are like in this particular, that they
are derived from the same cause. In like
manner, when two or more objects are joint
causes of the same effects, they are related to
one another, and the perception of the one
readily carries the thoughts to the other.</P>
<P>ORDER, as well as the other relations which
promote association, may be distinguished into
different species.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217"/>
THERE is an order in place. The or∣der
of things in place may seem sometimes
to promote association almost only by the in∣fluence
of vicinity. Thus the thinking of
one of a company, will first lead us to think
of the person who sat contiguous to him, then
of another who was next to this second, and
so on, till we have gone through the whole
company in the order in which they happened
to be placed. Here the order of the persons,
by which the imagination is affected, appears
to be little different from vicinity. But it
really is somewhat different: we may sup∣pose
the same number of persons of which
the company consisted, standing together in
a confused crowd: in this situation, they may
be more closely contiguous than before; but
they have not order, and therefore one of
them will not so readily suggest the rest, nor
will it be so easy to recollect them all. What
then is the difference between these two situ∣ations?
Formerly these persons did compose
a regular figure, now they do not. Order,
therefore, even of the simplest kind, includes
regularity of figure, as well as vicinity; and
by means of that regularity, order associates
ideas more strongly than vicinity alone. But
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
order in place often implies more; it arises
from those things or parts of things being
placed contiguous, which are connected by
other relations. Thus a number of persons
may be placed, not only in some regular
figure, but in a farther order, according to
their sex, age, or dignity. In this case, the
associating force of order, is made up of the
united forces of contiguity, and of the rela∣tions
which the things or parts bear to one
another, independent of their contiguity.
The parts of a watch are placed in order,
when each part is contiguous to those from
which it receives, and to which it communi∣cates
motion. In consequence of this, the
idea of any one part will lead us to conceive
the part next to it, or to conceive all the parts,
or will suggest an idea of the whole, much
more easily and quickly than it could, if we
only considered that part as laid in a heap
along with the rest: yet in a heap, the parts
might have had closer contiguity, than in the
machine.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise an order in time. It
arises from placing those things in immediate
succession, which are related by resemblance
causation, or any other relation. Succession
alone would associate the ideas, though their
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
objects were not otherwise related; these re∣lations
would associate them, though the things
had not been successive; both being combined
in order, it must have great power to produce
association. In a regular procession, persons
not only follow one another, but are disposed
according to their rank and dignity: in con∣sequence
of this, either the view, or a descrip∣tion
of a small part of a procession, is enough
to enable the imagination to pass along all the
other parts, and to take in a conception of the
whole. Successive events are generally con∣nected
as causes and effects: when they are,
they will readily occur to every person in the
order in which they happened, and influenced
one another; every narration may suggest
examples of this. But when successive objects
happen not to be thus connected, they are
slightly associated by mere succession. In a
chronological table, events are connected by
succession alone; in a regular history, by or∣der;
in this last case, there is a much greater
union of the parts, than in the former. The
other relations which, in order, are joined
with succession, have so considerable force,
that an historian often gives the most perfect
order to his narration, by bringing together
events in it, which have a natural connexion,
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
though they did not happen in immediate suc∣cession,
and is, without reflection or design,
led to adopt this order.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise what may be called an
order of nature. This has often a great ana∣logy
to order in place and in time. It is no
wonder that it should, since we conceive all
things as connected both with place and with
time. Order in both seems to be, in some in∣stances,
established by nature; our thoughts
move easily in tracing descent, or in following
the course of time, but with difficulty in tra∣cing
ascent, or in going backward in time. But
still the species of order now under considera∣tion,
is different from the other two. In
many cases, there is a natural order in things
themselves: hence one manner of considering
them, is according to order, and another con∣trary
to it; our thoughts must proceed in that
natural order, else their progress is obstructed.
In conceiving a man, our thoughts pass rea∣dily
from the head downwards; it is in many
respects the principal part of the body, and
by it that nourishment is conveyed, which
sustains the whole. In conceiving a tree we
proceed upwards from the root to the stem
and the branches: it is from the first that
these latter parts derive their nourishment,
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
and by it they are supported; there is also a
succession in their first production, they grow
up gradually from the root: both these causes
have an influence on the course of our
thoughts. In conceiving a house, the mind,
in like manner, naturally ascends from the
bottom to the top, and for the same reasons;
the inferiour parts support the superiour; the
building proceeds from the foundation up∣wards:
besides, if we would go into the house,
we must ascend from the ground towards the
roof; the mind takes the same course.</P>
<P>THERE are perhaps some cases in which
custom alone fixes a certain order; but after
custom has fixt it, it operates as strongly on
the mind, as if it had been established by na∣ture.
Writing from right to left, or from
left to right, is determined merely by custom;
but in consequence of that custom, an Euro∣pean
finds difficulty in tracing the combina∣tion
of letters in the former direction, and an
Oriental finds equal difficulty in tracing that
combination in the latter direction.</P>
<P>THUS every one of the associating princi∣ples
assumes many different forms; and every
distinct form which any of them can assume,
may be considered as a separate relation, and
necessarily produces a correspondent peculia∣rity
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
in the exertion of genius, which is di∣rected
by it. The several modifications of
these principles must contribute both to in∣crease
the force, and to diversify the form of
genius, in the very same ways, as it has been
already shown that the variety of their com∣binations
does.</P>

<P>THE observations which we have hitherto
made, show that there must be great
differences and dissimilitudes in the effects of
genius; for they lead us to perceive that it may
proceed from one conception to another in an
infinite variety of ways. But in order to ex∣plain,
in what manner the multitude of the
associating qualities lays a foundation for per∣manent
diversities of genius, some farther ob∣servations
will be necessary.</P>
<P>ALL the associating principles have some
degree of force in every man. There is per∣haps
no person on whom any one of them has
no influence at all. But in almost every man,
some one of them is predominant: on every
subject, a man is apt to follow one relation;
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
rather than any other, and to conceive chiefly
such ideas as are, by that relation, connected
with the present perception. Whence this
proceeds, is perhaps inexplicable; it must,
in a great measure, be resolved into original
differences in the constitution of the mind:
but the thing itself is evident in the most sim∣ple
and common instances. If different per∣sons
set themselves to recollect a company, one
naturally recollects it by running over the
places occupied by those who composed it;
another enumerates them according to their
several professions, conditions, ages, or sexes;
another according to their respective families
and connexions: in the first person, vicinity
or order; in the second, resemblance; in the
third, the relation of cause and effect, is the
predominant principle of association.</P>
<P>WHEN any object is conceived by a person,
all its qualities are in some measure present to
his view: but in consequence of original dif∣ferences
in the turn of men's imaginations,
one man's attention is fixt chiefly on one of
these qualities, and another man's attention
on a different quality. This is, in many
cases, the immediate cause of the predomi∣nance
of one associating principle. The dif∣ferent
qualities of an object not only lay a
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
foundation for a connexion between it and
different objects, but also connect it with those
different objects by means of different rela∣tions;
and each person is affected by that re∣lation;
which belongs to the quality on which
he most readily fixes his attention. A few
persons can scarce engage in a conversation
on any subject, without affording an example
of this. Whatever it be that is first intro∣duced,
almost every person considers it in a
different point of view, and in consequence
of this runs into a different train of thinking
and a different set of reflections. When dia∣logue
is conducted naturally, the several asso∣ciating
qualities by which the speakers are af∣fected,
may be easily traced out: each of
them goes on in a train suited to his own turn
of imagination, and one of them sometimes
in a train even opposite to that which is pur∣sued
by another. By care to preserve this va∣riety,
dialogue-writing is rendered natural;
and it is on account of the difficulty of pre∣serving
this variety, that so few succeed in that
manner of writing.</P>
<P>AN original constitution of mind is not the
only cause of a person's being influenced by
one associating principle more than by others:
it was formerly observed, that this may pro∣ceed
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
from habit. But the habit generally
takes its rise from an original propensity to
follow chiefly one relation; it always takes
its rise from this, when its effects are perma∣nent.
A diversity in the predominant prin∣ciple
of association, is often observable very
early in children, previous to the possibility
of their having contracted habits of thinking,
and must therefore be natural. If the origi∣nal
propensity be weak, it may be over∣powered
by other causes: but if it be strong,
it will frequently exert itself; by frequent
exertion it will beget a habit of being influ∣enced
by it; and by the formation of the
habit it will be confirmed. Still, therefore,
the predominance of one associating principle
or another, is, in most cases at least, ultimately
resolvable into an original constitution of the
mind.</P>
<P>HERE is a direct foundation for a perma∣nent
variety of genius. In some man of ge∣nius
or another, each of the associating prin∣ciples
is predominant; and whichever of them
is, it forms a turn of genius suitable to it, and
different from what the prevalence of any
other would have produced. Invention in
different arts and sciences, is dependent on
very different relations of perceptions: genius
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
for a particular art or science, will therefore
be formed by the prevalence of that principle
of association which chiefly leads to invention
in it. In comparing the works of men of ge∣nius,
we may find numberless illustrations of
this: we may often find the same fact or the
same object present to the minds of the philo∣sopher,
the historian, the poet, the orator,
the painter; we may observe that it leads each
of them a different road, or that they pass
from it to other ideas by different relations;
and by attending to these, we may be able to
ascertain and describe the peculiarity of genius
in each of them.</P>
<P>WHAT has been now said of the different
principles of association, is equally applicable
to all the different forms or modifications of
which it has been shown that every one of
these principles is capable. There are various
kinds of resemblance, for instance, of contra∣riety,
of causation; one man is naturally in∣fluenced
chiefly by one kind, another by ano∣ther
kind; the turn of genius in each is suit∣able
to that kind by which he is most affected.
Hence must arise many diversities of genius.
Whether a person pass from causes to effects,
or from effects to causes, his imagination is
influenced by the same relation: yet all men
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
are not equally fitted for both. In mathema∣tics,
one man is most turned for algebra,
another for geometry. One excells in the
analytical part of philosophy, in resolving
phenomena into their causes, and reducing
them to general laws; and another excells in
explaining the phenomena, in applying ge∣neral
principles to a number of cases, and in
accounting for them elegantly and success∣fully.
Many of the false systems of philoso∣phy
which have made a figure in the world,
certainly display very considerable genius, but
genius of different kinds. Des Cartes de∣duced
his whole philosophy from a few ge∣neral
principles: he showed a propensity to
pass from causes to their effects. Gilbert en∣deavoured,
in a manner not at all destitute of
ingenuity, to resolve all the phenomena of
nature into magnetism: the prevailing turn
of his imagination was to proceed from effects
to causes.</P>
<P>MOST commonly, the great divisions of ge∣nius
arise from the prevalence of one <HI>principle</HI>
of association or another; and the more mi∣nute
varieties from the prevalence of different
<HI>modifications</HI> of the same principle. Yet these
modifications are sometimes so dissimilar, that
the predominance of one or another of them
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
produces a difference of genius as great as
could be produced by the predominance of
principles totally distinct. In a mere recital
of facts, there is scarce any room for genius:
but the true historian does not consine himself
to such recital; he places facts in connexion,
he rises to the sources of actions, and he pur∣sues
them through their consequences: it is
in this that historical genius appears; and in
this the historian is plainly actuated by the
relation of cause and effect. The same actions
which the historian relates, may be also con∣sidered
by the philosopher, their motives at∣tended
to, and conclusions deduced from them,
concerning the constitution of human nature:
in this he is influenced by the same relation
of cause and effect, but by a different species
of it; and accordingly he shows a kind of ge∣nius
totally distinct from that of the historian.
I shall give an example which is still more
striking. In reducing bodies to regular divi∣sions
and subdivisions, the natural historian is
conducted altogether by the principle of re∣semblance;
in adorning a subject with similes
and metaphors, the poet is likewise under the
influence of the principle of resemblance:
yet no two sorts of genius are perhaps more
different than that for natural history, and
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
that for poetry. In accounting for the phe∣nomena
of bodies, the philosopher follows a
quite different relation, that of cause and ef∣fect;
but the genius of a natural historian,
is much more akin to philosophical, than to
poetical genius.</P>
<P>BUT farther; Not only the prevalence of
different forms of the same associating prin∣ciple,
is sufficient for producing very dissimi∣lar
turns of genius; but also one of these
forms only operating in somewhat different
manners, has force enough to mark genius
with a perceptible peculiarity. An image is
always connected with a subject by resem∣blance:
but the image may be applied either
in a comparison or in a metaphor; and one
person is led by the turn of his imagination
chiefly to the use of the one, and another per∣son
chiefly to the use of the other of these
figures. Here a diversity of genius, so consi∣derable
that it may become in some degree
characteristical, arises from a very small dif∣ference
in the manner in which two persons
pass from one perception to another by means
of the very same relation, from their only
passing with different degrees of rapidity, and
considering the resembling object with diffe∣rent
degrees of deliberation. Nay, though two
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
poets illustrate their subjects by the same com∣parison,
they may display a variety of genius
by their different manners of pursuing it:
one is happy at setting the main image full in
view by one bold stroke; the other traces the
likeness minutely, and thus introduces ele∣gance
into his work. When differences so
minute in the form of the same associating
principle, and even in the manner of our
yielding to the same form of any of the asso∣ciating
principles, can give a peculiar turn to
the imagination, there must evidently be room
for a prodigious variety in genius.</P>
<P>WE would be apt to take it for granted,
that the associating force of any relation must
be in proportion to the degree of that relation.
The more perfect the relation is between two
perceptions, the more closely, we would ex∣pect,
they shall be united in the imagination,
and the more readily shall one of them suggest
the other. If resemblance, for instance, be
what gives one perception a tendency to in∣troduce
another, it is natural to think that this
tendency will be strongest when the resem∣blance
is greatest. Doubless this is generally
the case: but it is far from holding univer∣sally;
there are several limitations and excep∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231"/>
FOR example, Though the relation which
one object bears to another be very strong,
yet if it be common, if it be such as that ob∣ject
bears likewise to many other objects, it
will not operate so strongly on the imagina∣tion,
as a weaker relation which is special and
distinguishing. Number distracts the atten∣tion,
and hinders any one of the objects from
making a striking impression. A nobleman
attracts less notice in a crowd of persons of his
own rank, than a man of much lower note,
would command in a company where he has
no equal. Singularity is always striking.</P>
<P>AGAIN; If it be asserted that the stronger
relation will prove the most powerful princi∣ple
of association, the assertion must be con∣fined
to one form or modification of that
relation. Of the various forms or modifica∣tions
which, it has been shown, every rela∣tion
admits, some may be considered as
greater in degree than others: but different
men are chiefly affected by different modifi∣cations
of a relation; and therefore some will
be most affected by a weaker relation, because
it is of that form from which they are most
susceptible of an impression. Indeed, some of
the peculiarities of genius necessarily imply a
propensity to be influenced most by some of
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>
the weaker modifications of the associating
principles. Poetical genius, for example, so
far as it depends on the force of the principle
of resemblance, consists in a propensity to be
affected, not by the completest resemblances,
but by such as are more imperfect. In poeti∣cal
imagery, the resemblance ought to be
always just, but it is an excellence that it be
not altogether obvious, and it is necessary
that it be mixt with something of diversity.
Any individual is likened, not so often to
another individual of the same species, as to
one of a different species, or even to some∣thing
totally different in kind: a hero is com∣pared,
not so frequently nor so beautifully to
another hero, as to a lion or to the sun. The
exact similitudes to which the naturalist con∣fines
his attention, have no influence upon
the poet, and would be a very improper
foundation for metaphors or comparisons.</P>
<P>BUT it is further observable, That some are
apt to be influenced even by a weak degree of
any modification of an associating quality,
rather than by a stronger degree of the very
same modification. Thus some men, on
whatever subject they reason, deduce all their
reasonings from remote principles, and never
prove any point by the shortest and most di∣rect
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
arguments. There are writers, most of
whose images and antitheses are far-fetched
and forced. This turn of imagination pro∣duces
a peculiarity of genius, but generally
such an one as is faulty. A late ingenious
writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> has remarked this peculiarity, that
some are apt to attend chiefly to remote and
trifling relations of ideas; and he gives a
very apposite example of it from Shakespear;
<HI>Hostess.</HI> Thou didst swear to me on a
parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin∣chamber,
at the round table, by a sea-coal
fire, on Wednesday in Whitsun-week, when
the Prince broke thy head for likening him to
a singing man of Windsor; thou didst swear
to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to
marry me, and make me my lady thy wife.
Canst thou deny it? did not good-wise Keach
the butcher's wife come in then, and call me
gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess
of vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of
prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some;
whereby I told thee they were ill for a green
wound; and didst not thou, when she was
gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so
familiarity with such poor people, saying that
ere long they should call me Madam? and
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee
thirty shillings?”<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Second part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 2. scene 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>That author accounts for this peculiarity, by
resolving it into a want of discernment; but
this account is not altogether satisfying. Sup∣pose
remote or slightly connected ideas to have
occurred to a person, discernment may lead
him to reject them, and the want of it may
prevent his rejecting them. But the question
remains, Whence comes it that such ideas
occur to some, and not to others? Their oc∣curring
may in some measure proceed indi∣rectly
from a want of discernment: the judg∣ment
of some men is so strong that it attends
imagination in all its exertions, and gives it
an habitual tendency to suggest only such
ideas as have a proper connexion with the
present perception; a defect of judgment or
discernment prevents imagination from ac∣quiring
this correctness, the want of which
leaves it at liberty to run into slight and re∣mote
associations. But this is not the princi∣pal
or immediate, far less the only cause of
it: its origin must be sought chiefly in the na∣tural
turn of the imagination. If we attend
to the example just now quoted, we shall
find that all the trisling associations contained
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
in it, consist in the introduction of a number
of circumstances which have no other con∣nexion
with the subject of discourse, but this,
that they happened in the place and at the
time to which it refers. The turn of imagi∣nation
which it shows, seems therefore to
arise merely from vicinity being the prevail∣ing
principle of association. Mere vicinity
either in time or in place, is one of the slightest
and least important relations, and consequently
whenever it is the prevailing relation, it will
produce a propensity to trifling associations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>That the prevalence of this relation, is by far the most common cause of trifling associations, may, I believe, be affirmed with considence. If we examine several instances of such trifling associations, we shall find that they are generally formed by mere vicinity. One other inftance I shall give from the same author.</P>

The predominance of the principle of resem∣blance,
when indulged without reserve, often
produces a similar propensity, as in the <HI>new
song of new similies.</HI> Some of the qualities of
every thing are less important than others;
they give rise to none but trivial relations; a
propensity therefore to attend chiefly to such
qualities, must produce trifling associations,
whatever be the principle to which they be∣long.
It deserves to be remarked, however,
that a tendency to conceive ideas which are
but remotely connected with the present per∣ception,
sometimes constitutes an excellence
of genius. Some men see at one glance, the
most distant causes and consequences of things.
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
This proceeds from an uncommon activity of
imagination, which enables it to pass in an
instant through a long series of ideas, so that
all the middle steps are scarce attended to, and
very quickly forgotten.</P>
<P>THE peculiar form which genius assumes,
depends not on the predominant principle of
association alone, but also on the degree of
force which all the other principles of associ∣ation
have. There is not any subject in which
invention depends upon, or can be accom∣plished
by only one of these principles. In
every subject, there is one <HI>leading</HI> principle of
invention; but many other principles, by be∣ing
exerted in <HI>subordination</HI> to that, contribute
to the invention. Though one associating
principle be predominant in every man of
genius, yet all the other principles operate
along with it. These may be combined in
very different proportions; and every differ∣ence
in the manner of their combination, or
in their comparative strength, will produce as
real, though not so remarkable a peculiarity
of genius, as a difference in the predominant
principle. In such genius, for instance, as
enables a man to account for the phenomena
of things, the relation of cause and effect is
the predominant principle of association: but
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
resemblance also must have some force, other∣wise
the similar phenomena, and the analo∣gous
experiments from which general conclu∣sions
are deducible, cannot be suggested; order
must have some influence, for if the observa∣tions
be not properly disposed, they will lead
to no conclusion: contrariety must have some
influence, else those contradictory instances
will not occur, which are necessary for limit∣ing
the conclsusions and giving them preci∣sion.
Every different proportion which these
principles bear to one another, will stamp phi∣losophical
genius with a peculiar character,
will adapt it to one particular sort of subjects,
or will give it a determinate degree of excel∣lence.
In genius of every kind, there is the
like complication and adjustment of associating
principles. In every individual, genius is like
an organized body, the form of which arises
from the manner in which the several mem∣bers
are combined, and is altered by every the
the smallest change in the size or position of
any one of them. This being the case, the
possible arrangements and subordinations of all
the associating principles and their modifica∣tions,
are so many that they lay a foundation
for an endless variety of genius.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Flexibility of Imagination.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now pointed out some fixt and
permanent qualities of the imagina∣tion,
which are sufficient for the production
of a great variety of genius: but before we
leave this part of the subject, it will be pro∣per
to observe, that imagination has a certain
pliableness or flexibility, by means of which
still greater variety is introduced.</P>
<P>ANY particular turn of imagination does
not lie in a mere point; it admits some lati∣tude
without losing its characteristical pecu∣liarity.
The predominant principle of associ∣ation
may continue the same in the main, and
yet lead into tracks of thought considerably
different: the proportions which the several
principles of association bear to one another,
may be altered without being wholly destroy∣ed;
just as the consiguration of the features
may be altered in a face by different passions
or different states of health, and yet that face
be acknowleged the same, and remain clearly
distinguishable from every other. In conse∣quence
of this flexibility, the discoveries of
the same person, on the same subject, will be
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
very different at different times. If a person
write his thoughts on a subject at different
periods, the sentiments, the imagery, the com∣position,
the order, will be far from being the
very same. In some cases the difference is so
great, as to show that different associating
principles, at least very different modifications
of the same principle, have been predominant
at these different periods.</P>
<P>A TEMPORARY variation in the turn of a
man's imagination, or in the form of his ge∣nius,
sometimes arises from causes as far be∣yond
the reach of our investigation, as many
of those which produce an alteration in the
constitution of the body, or of those which
make one summer to differ from another.
But such variation may often be accounted
for from the influence which habit has upon
the operations of fancy.</P>
<P>HABIT disposes men to be easily affected
by a relation which they have for some time
been accustomed to follow; and it often dis∣poses
them so strongly to this, as to make some
other associating principle to prevail for a
while, above that which is naturally predomi∣nant.
To this effect of habit it is owing,
that a man, by applying for some time to a
subject which he could scarce force himself to
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
study at first, comes to enter into it with ease.
From the same effect of habit, will arise a very
great degree of that diversity which has been
mentioned, in the productions of one man on
the same subject.</P>
<P>HABIT may contribute to this diversity in
another way, and that even without making
any alteration in the predominant principle
of association. Habit makes such ideas as are
at the time most familiar to us, rush more
readily into the mind, than such as are less
familiar, though these latter be equally or
even more strongly related to the present per∣ception.
Many causes render different ideas
most familiar to a person at different times:
and as a perception may be connected, by
means of any one associating quality, with a
thousand others, that perception will naturally
suggest any of these which is at present most
familiar, provided it be connected with it by
the relation which has greatest influence on
that particular person. Other ideas may be
more strongly connected with it by the same
relation, and would be more readily suggested
to a person who was not under the power of
that habit; but with this person, the famili∣arity
of the former idea gains it the prefer∣ence
to all others. When on the first concep∣tion
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
of a subject, certain ideas belonging to it
occur in this manner, by reason of their fami∣liarity
to us, they lead us to such other ideas
as have the strongest relation to them. But
if the ideas which were first suggested, had
been different, they would have led us, by the
same principles, into a very different train of
thinking, and the whole work would have
born a very dissimilar aspect. Thus when a
person sets out from a place where several
roads terminate, a very few steps decide which
of them he takes; and by going on in it, he
arrives at a place very distant from that to
which he should have been brought by ano∣ther
of the roads issuing from the same point.</P>
<P>THIS flexibility of imagination takes place
in all men, in some degree; but it takes place
in some men, in a much greater degree than
in others. No man has an imagination so
dull, or an imagination so invariably fixt in
one form, as to be nowise affected by habit or
other occasional causes: but there are two sorts
of persons, who are disposed to be most affected
by these. First, they whose genius is not very
great, nor strongly marked with any pecu∣liarity.
It is on this account easily turned
out of its direction by accidental causes, and
eagerly lays hold of the assistance which may
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
be derived from their operation. Secondly,
they whose genius is uncommonly strong and
lively. In these the same effect is produced
by a very different cause: the vigour and ac∣tivity
of their associating powers, bestows
great delicacy and sensibility upon their ima∣ginations,
and renders them susceptible of
strong impressions from any temporary causes;
they feel the force of every such cause, and
receive a transient form or tincture from it.
The productions of these two different sorts
of persons, bear marks of the different causes
from which the flexibility of their fancies
springs. The works of the former have no
common character, but are almost as unlike
to one another as to the works of a different
person; but through all the works of the lat∣ter,
notwithstanding their varieties, there runs
a certain peculiarity, which shows that they
had the same author.</P>
<P>IT has been often observed, that the dif∣ferent
works of men of genius sometimes dif∣fer
very much in the degree of their perfec∣tion.
This may sometimes arise from the
subjects not being equally adapted to their abi∣lities.
But in many cases it happens, that a
person will at one time very successfully pro∣secute
a subject which he has often attempted
<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
in vain before, or accomplish a discovery by
accident, which has eluded many professed in∣vestigations.
This may frequently be ac∣counted
for from the principles just now esta∣blished.
Habit, or some other incidental cause,
gives the fancy at one time a turn, which we
do not reflect upon, but which prepares it for
attaining a certain discovery; and that either
by rendering an idea familiar, which is sub∣servient
to that discovery, or by disposing it
to follow the relation which leads most natu∣rally
to the discovery. At another time, the
same cause gives the mind so strong a propen∣sity
to attend to an idea, or to follow a rela∣tion
which draws us off from the proper track,
and obstructs the invention, that no efforts
can conquer it. When the appearance arises
not from this cause, it may often be ascribed
to the inequalities which are incident to the
vigour of genius in the same man at different
times, and which may be in some measure
accounted for from the observations that have
been formerly made. Though the principles
of association be never perhaps entirely dor∣mant
or impotent, yet they are not, in any
any man, alike prone to exert themselves, or
fit for acting with the same force, at all seasons.
Sometimes they are active, and ready to run
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
from any idea that occurs, through a long
train of other ideas related to it, without a
possibility of our resisting their influence, or
cooling the ardour which their activity in∣spires.
When the imagination is in this state,
and is at the same time impressed with a strong
view of a particular end, genius is extensive
and vigorous, and can with ease perfect in∣ventions,
as by a lucky and unaccountable hit,
in pursuing which it has formerly toiled in
vain. To produce this vigour and alertness
of invention, it is necessary that there be some
present perception connected with many
others, from which it may set out; that the
associating principle to which that connexion
corresponds, be strong; that the mind be not
deeply engaged in any other train of thinking
which would lead off from this track; and
that we have a strong association of the de∣sign.
If any of these conditions be wanting,
that alertness will be obstructed. It some∣times
is obstructed to a very great degree;
fancy is depressed, the power of association
seems to be suspended, or if it at all exert it∣self,
it is only in trifling, unmeaning excur∣sions;
it is too feeble to keep the design in
view, and is continually allowing us to quit
the road which would lead us forward to a
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
valuable invention. While this debility of
imagination continues, it throws genius into
a state of languor. It enters on its work with∣out
sufficient ardour; it is sluggish, and can
make no progress in it; it suggests no ideas,
or but few that are conducive to its intention;
and all our efforts to exert it are unsuccessful.
We cannot call up ideas, as it were, by name,
we can only cast ourselves into the roads in
which they are likeliest to occur; and if fancy
be not powerful enough to bring them into
view, we must remain without them. This
accounts, in a great measure, for the common
observation, that most useful inventions have
been made by accident, often when men were
in search of something else. This shows us
likewise, why the greatest geniuses sometimes
sink below themselves, and fail in undertak∣ings
in which at another time they would
have easily succeeded. It is as impossible,
during these unfavourable turns of genius, to
supply its defects by application, as it is for
application to produce genius in those who
naturally want it. The force and splendour
of imagination throw a lustre on the pro∣ductions
of real genius, which renders them
easily distinguishable from the lifeless and
insipid productions of unanimated industry.
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
Diligence and acquired abilities may assist or
improve genius, but it is only a vigorous ima∣gination
that can produce it. Whenever mere
labour is substituted in the place of this, it
can but mimic genius: the work will always
bear evident traces of unnatural force and auk∣ward
straining.</P>
<P>THE flexibility of the human imagination
appears not only in a person's attempts on
the same subject: in some men's efforts on
different subjects, it appears very remarkably.
There are men in whom one associating prin∣ciple
seems to be predominant when they are
engaged in some subjects, and a totally differ∣ent
principle when they apply to subjects of
another kind. Whatever be their present sub∣ject,
their minds adapt themselves in an in∣stant
to it, and are prepared to yield them∣selves
wholly up to those relations which be∣long
to that subject, and by means of which
discoveries may be made in it. It is not easy
to explain all the causes from which this sort
of flexibility arises; perhaps it is in some
measure unaccountable: but there is one cause
to which it is often owing. Every work in
which genius can be employed, has a parti∣cular
design or end. True genius always fits
a man for forming a lively and permanent
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
conception of the design, such a conception
of it as may make all his thoughts to move
in subservience to it. An uncommon vigour
and delicacy of the associating principles will
enable a man to conceive many dissimilar de∣signs,
with all the vivacity which is requisite
for making any one of them dwell on the
imagination. Its nature gives a temporary
bent to the mind. It infuses great activity
into those associating principles, by our fol∣lowing
of which it may be promoted. These
principles are not, perhaps, naturally predo∣minant
in the person; the perception of a
different design would have rendered a quite
different principle predominant: but these
have naturally so great a degree of strength,
that, with the assistance which they receive from
the design, they can be made to prevail, and
to regulate, for some time, all the exertions
of the imagination. In some men, a capacity
of being strongly affected with the view of
any particular design, and a pliancy of fancy
consequent on this, are so great, that their ge∣nius
seems to be almost equally adapted to the
most opposite subjects. There have been per∣sons
who were at once inventors in matters of
science, and originals in the arts. In mimics
this pliancy of fancy appears in a very great
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
degree, though it be employed in an inferiour
province. Wherever it is possessed, a per∣son's
thoughts are wholly moulded by the pre∣sent
design; he loses sight of himself, and is
perfectly transformed into the character which
he wants to assume. Thus as a fitness for
being strongly impressed by a design, bestows
regularity on genius, so a capacity of being
equally impressed by dissimilar designs, gives
a great variety and compass to the genius of a
particular person.</P>
<P>WE have now endeavoured to discover the
sources of the varieties of genius, so far as
they lie in the peculiarities of the imagina∣tion.
If none of the associating principles be
strong, there can be no genius. If one be re∣markably
vigorous in comparison with the
rest, genius will be fixt to one sort of subjects
suited to that principle. If all of them be
very vigorous, the perception of a particular
design will have force enough to give any one
of them a temporary prevalence; and by this
means genius will have great compass, its ex∣ertions
will be susceptible of great variety. In
proportion to the degree of variety of which
genius is thus susceptible, it will approach the
nearer to universality.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250"/>
BUT though the varieties which belong to
imagination, evidently produce many diver∣sities
of genius, we shall never be able to ac∣count
for all its diversities by attending only
to the imagination; for imagination alone is
not sufficient for compleating any work of ge∣nius.
In all its perfect exertions; it derives
aid from other faculties, the varieties of which
must contribute somewhat to the several forms
which it assumes. The faculties from which
imagination receives assistance, are sense, me∣mory,
and judgment. An enquiry into the
varieties of which the first of these is capable,
would give us little light: the varieties inci∣dent
to the two last, it will be of importance
to examine. The varieties of memory bear
the nearest analogy to those of imagination,
and for that reason it will be natural first to
explain them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Varieties of Memory, and their Influence
on Genius.</HEAD>
<P>MEMORY is employed either in retain∣ing
single perceptions, or in preserv∣ing
the order and connexion of different
perceptions. It is susceptible of considerable
varieties in respect of both these exertions.
<PB N="244" REF="251"/>
EVERY perception retained by memory, de∣cays
by length of time. As distant objects
look fainter and smaller to the eye, and as
distant sounds strike the ear more feebly, than
such as are near; so the remembrance of things
past grows weaker in proportion to the time
which has elapsed since they were present;
and at last every trace of them is obliterated.
But some perceptions decay much more slowly
than others. While one perception is for∣gotten
as soon as it is received, the remem∣brance
of another is firm and permanent for
many years. The general principles on which
the permanence of remembrance depends, are
very simple.</P>
<P>IT may be established as a principle, that
those perceptions are most firmly and perma∣nently
remembered, which were strongest at
first. A strong perception, like a deep shade
of colouring, seems to decay more slowly than
one that is faint and delicate; and though it
should decay as fast, it would be longer be∣fore
it were effaced. The particular cases
reducible to this general principle, are very
numerous; and they are all experiments
serving to confirm it. They are chiefly the
following.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252"/>
THE perceptions of sense are always stronger
than any ideas which we can form; and ac∣cordingly
what we have perceived by our
senses, is better remembered than what we
have only heard or read of. The percep∣tions
of some of the senses, are stronger and
more striking than those of other senses; and
in consequence of that they fix themselves
more durably in the memory. Of all our
perceptions, pleasure and pain are those which
affect us most deeply; and the objects which
produce them, lay fastest hold of the memory:
we often hear men give it as a reason for their
never being able to forget one thing, that it
affected them much; and give it as a reason
for their having no remembrance of another
thing, that it did not at all interest them.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Siquas res in vita videmus parvas, usitatas, quotidiana<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, eas meminisse non solemus: propterea quod nulla nisi nova, aut admirabili re commovetur animus. At si quid videmus aut audimus egregie turpe, aut honestum, inusitatum, magnum, incredibile, ridiculam, id diu meminisse consuevimus. <HI>Ad Heren.</HI> lib. iii.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOME degree of attention is necessary for
our perceiving objects at all; sounds often
strike the ear without being heard, things are
often full in our view without being seen;
the whole attention of the soul is otherwise
engaged. By bestowing attention, the mind
as it were embraces the objects exhibited to it,
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
and lays itself open to a strong impression
from them, which makes them both affect it
much while they are present, and keep firm
possession of the memory afterwards. The
length of time for which attention is bestowed,
as well as the closeness of the attention, ren∣ders
our perception of an object the stronger;
and it renders the remembrance of it propor∣tionably
the more lasting<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nec dubium est, quin plurimum in hac parte valeat mentis intentio, et velut acies luminum a prospectu rerum quas intuetur, non aversa. Unde accidit, ut quae per plures dies scribimus ediscendi causa, cogitatione ipsa contineat QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. In like man∣ner,
by returning often to the contemplation
of an object, we learn to conceive it vigorously,
and the remembrance of it becomes clear and
permanent: a perception which has seldom
affected the senses, is quickly obliterated from
the memory; light and colours are totally
forgotten by those who have early lost their
sight: but such perceptions as are repeated
every day, never quit their hold of the me∣mory;
by the attention bestowed upon them
as often as they recur, they are preserved in
their original strength, without finding time
even to begin to decay.</P>
<P>IT is observed, that every thing is well
remembered, which is impressed on the mind
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
when free and disengaged<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Plurimum conferre—animum cogitationibus aliis liberum. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. This is one
of the circumstances which render the morn∣ing
favourable to study<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. On this account
we retain through life, what we learn in child∣hood
and early youth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Quae acciderunt in pueritia, meminimus optime saepe. <HI>Ad Heren.</HI> lib. iii.</NOTE>. When the mind is
already occupied by one object, an effort is
necessary to draw it off from that object; this
effort weakens the application with which we
attend to the succeeding object: the former
object still attracts some part of our attention,
and thus farther weakens our conception of
the other. But a disengaged mind bestows
its whole attention on the object that is pre∣sented
to it, and conceives it with great viva∣city.
Thus also, a thing is well remembered,
when the mind is, for some time after having
perceived it, occupied by no new object<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Aliae instantiae dabunt hanc alteram spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciem; ut quae maxime imprimuntur a mente pura, et minus praeoceupata ante vel post; veluti quae discuntur in pueritia, aut quae com∣mentamur ante somnum, etiam primae quaeque reruin vices; magis haereant in memoria. VERULAM. <HI>Nov. Org.</HI> lib. II. aph. 26.</NOTE>:
in this case there is room for continued, as
well as close, attention, which strengthens
the impression on the senses, and, in conse∣quence
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
of that, upon the memory. Pre-ex∣pectation
likewise renders the remembrance
of an object durable: it rouses the attention,
it puts the mind in a proper disposition for
bestowing attention, it invigorates our con∣ception
of the object<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Aliae denique instantiae dabunt hanc alteram speciem; ut quae expectantur, et attentionem excitant, melius haereant, quam quae praetervolant. Itaque fi scriptum aliquod vicies perlegeris, non tam facile illud memoriter disces, quam si illud legas decies, tentando interim illud recitare, et ubi de∣ficit memoria, inspiciendo librum. VERULAM. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE>. It is from experi∣ence
of these effects of pre-expectation, that
persons who wish us to be much affected with
what they communicate, raise our curiosity,
delay satisfying it, and render us as impatient
as they can.</P>
<P>ONCE more, we remember that best, which
we understand most perfectly. What we un∣derstand,
strikes us with its whole force: of
what we understand imperfectly, it is only
the part understood, that makes any impres∣sion
on us; of the rest we have no perception;
even that part makes but a faint impression;
it would acquire additional force from its
connexion with the other parts, if the whole
were understood.</P>
<P>IN all these instances it appears, that per∣ceptions
originally strong, are most firmly
remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="256"/>
MEMORY preserves the order and con∣nexion
of perceptions, as well as the percep∣tions
themselves. If it did not, we could re∣tain
only simple perceptions. Every complex
object consists of several parts united together
in a certain manner; memory retains not
only all the parts, but also the manner in
which they are united. It retains the latter
so firmly, that we do not naturally attend to
the distinction of the parts which compose a
whole. It is almost only the philosopher that
thinks of enumerating them; and in order to
enumerate them, he must set himself pur∣posely
to analyse and decompound his idea of
the whole. Different wholes are connected
in nature by various relations; these relations
are observed when the things are exhibited to
our senses; and the real observed relations of
things are retained by the memory. As it is
by co-existence, that the parts of the same
whole are united, so it is by vicinity, causa∣tion,
and order, that different wholes are con∣nected
in nature, and, in consequence of the
observation of this, afterwards tied together
in the memory.</P>
<P>IN every case of strong and exact remem∣brance,
we have a clear perception of the
connexions of things, as well as of the things
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
themselves. Things which are in the memory
together, do not lie in confusion, but form
distinct images, and are beheld in their just
proportions. It is this property of memory,
that enables imagination to introduce into its
works, entire scenes of real history, or large
parts of nature, which we have actually ob∣served.
The introduction of these not only
assists the operation of imagination, and les∣sens
its labour, but likewise contributes to the
excellence of its productions. Shakespeare's
description of Dover cliff, may serve as an
example of the advantage to which genius
can turn this exercise of memory;
<Q><L>Come on, Sir, here's the place—stand still. How
fearful</L>
<L>And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!</L>
<L>The crows and choughs, that wing the mid-way air,</L>
<L>Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half-way down</L>
<L>Hangs one that gathers samphire; dreadful trade!</L>
<L>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.</L>
<L>The fishermen that walk upon the beach</L>
<L>Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,</L>
<L>Diminished to her cock; her cock a buoy</L>
<L>Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge</L>
<L>That on th' unnumbred idle pebbles chafes,</L>
<L>Cannot be heard so high<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>King Lear,</HI> act 4. scene 6.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="258"/>
Many descriptions and relations which are
introduced into poetry, as if they were the
creation of fancy, are really copied from me∣mory.
To have recourse, in this manner, to
memory, contributes greatly to bestow rich∣ness
and variety on the works of genius: for
no imagination has force enough to diversity
scenes seigned by itself, in so great a degree
as objects and events are diversified in nature.
Some painters, instead of imitating nature,
draw almost all their figures from a general
idea which they have formed to themselves.
The consequence is, that a sameness runs
through all their works; they represent not
that endless variety which attention to nature
would have suggested to them. Anthony
Tempesta and Peter Testa are taken notice of
as faulty in this way. On the other hand, it
is observed that attention to the real varieties
of nature, has introduced great variety into
the works of Salvator Rosa, except in one
particular, the legs of his figures, which are
copied not from nature, but from an idea of
his own, and which for this reason, though
well drawn, are too similar.</P>
<P>THUS memory, by retaining the real con∣nexions
of things, gives us a distinct and en∣tire
perception of these things, when they are
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
all actually present to our view. But it must
be remarked further, That when one of the
things only is in view, the rest may be brought
to our remembrance, by means of their con∣nexion
with it, preserved by memory. When
we think of one part of a machine, it suggests
the other parts, and the form of the whole,
When we think of one object in a complex
scene, it bring the rest into our view. When
memory presents one event, this leads us to
think of the other events which were con∣nected
with it, and to conceive them in their
proper order. The remembrance of many
periods of a discourse or of a great number of
verses, is often revived by the single word
with which they begin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Nam etiam excidentes, unius admonitione verbi in me∣moriam repountur. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Thus ideas are in∣troduced
by others with which they are con∣nected
in the memory, in the very same man∣ner
as it has been already shown that they are
introduced by those with which they are asso∣ciated
in the imagination. It is observable
too that the connexions retained by memory,
are the same with some of the relations by
which ideas are associated in the imagination.
On these accounts, the exertions of these two
faculties are often very analogous, and some∣times
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
times not distinguishable except by the person
himself. When things are connected in the
mind by vicinity, co-existence, causation, or
order, in the manner in which we have actu∣ally
observed them, and when at the same
time we have a conviction of our having ob∣served
them thus connected, the exhibition
not only of the things themselves, but also of
their connexions, is properly ascribed to me∣mory.
When these relations are bestowed
upon things to which they may belong, but
which we have never actually observed united
by them; when at least we have forgotten
that we had observed the things placed in these
relations; or when we join things together,
not by these relations, but on account of their
resemblance or their contrariety; in all these
cases, things are properly said to be associated
in the imagination, not conjoined in the me∣mory.
For example, when a person gives a
minute description of a country which he has
lately seen, or relates a series of events which
he has witnessed or learned from history, the
whole is owing to the exercise of memory;
imagination has no share in it. If he illus∣trate
any part of his recital by a comparison
with resembling objects, or enliven it by con∣tracts;
or if he have forgotten part of the ob∣jects,
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
and supply the defect which this would
occasion in his story, by putting in such cir∣cumstances
as are consistent with the other
parts; then he exercises imagination as really,
though not in so great a degree, as he who
contrives any of the imaginary trains of events
or scenes of action, which are common with
poets and writers of romance.</P>
<P>As the exertions of memory retaining the
connexions of things, and the exertions of
imagination, are thus analogous, so it is far∣ther
observable, that they are almost always
necessarily intermingled. Sometimes imagi∣nation
takes the lead, and memory acts in
subordination to it: how far, and in what
ways, was explained formerly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Part I. sect. 5.</NOTE>. Let us
now take notice, in what manner imagination
is exercised when it acts in subordination to
memory. In exhibition any one thing which
we have observed, or a number of things in
their observed order, memory alone is ex∣erted.
But from these we often pass to other
things, connected with them not by an order
really observed, but by some other ties: in
this case the transition is made by the imagi∣nation.
The things to which this transition
is made, are distinctly remembered; and
<PB N="255" REF="262"/>
while we dwell on them, memory is the only
faculty employed in conceiving them. It is
when we leave these, and pass to others not
connected with them in our experience, that
imagination is again exerted. We never can
have a long train of thoughts, or carry on a
long conversation, even relating to the merest
matters of fact, wholly by the suggestions of
memory, without any aid from imagination.
If this faculty did not interpose, and give us
a new impulse, our thoughts would quickly
stagnate, our conversation would fail, we
should be strictly confined to one subject, at
least to such groupes of objects and such suc∣cessive
events, as we have observed really con∣joined
in nature. Thus, as it was formerly
shown on the one hand, that memory assists
imagination in all works of genius, so on the
other hand memory receives great assistance
from imagination, in most of its operations.
What has been said on this point, will enable
us in some measure to conceive, how imagi∣nation,
and consequently genius, enters into
a species of composition from which many
have totally excluded it, the writing of his∣tory.
By what has been said, we are led
likewise to make a remark which regards ge∣nius
of every kind, That our remembrance
<PB N="256" REF="263"/>
of the real connexions of things, multiplies
the ties by which ideas are united in our
minds; and consequently multiplies both the
roads by which we may be led to the concep∣tion
of such ideas as we have occasion for,
and the combinations into which the relations
of ideas may be formed: and how much these
circumstances contribute both to the compass
and to the variety of genius, has been suffici∣ently
explained already.</P>
<P>THE fitness which both the connexions of
things retained by memory and their relations
in the imagination, have for causing one bring
others into our view, contributes much to the
strength and perfection of remembrance.
Without this, the exercise of memory would
be much more difficult than it is: for our re∣membering
any series of thoughts, it would
be necessary to impress them <HI>all</HI> vigorously on
the mind; if any of them were faint, it would
necessarily be forgotten. But because one
idea introduces others connected with it, we
may sometimes remember many, by gaining
a strong perception of a few: the relation of
the many to the few, will be sufficient for
calling them to mind, though they themselves
be but weakly remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264"/>
NAY farther; one perception may become
strong by being connected with another. This
observation is necessary for giving the just
extent to a principle formerly laid down,
That the firmness with which separate objects
are remembered, is in proportion to the
strength of our original perceptions of these
objects. This principle will appear liable to
many exceptions, if it be not remarked, that
though a perception was not itself strong at
first, yet if it was connected with a strong
perception, it is well remembered by means
of that connexion. A strong perception com∣municates
strength to other perceptions con∣nected
with it; and in consequence of this
communication, they imprint themselves as
deeply on the memory as if they had had in∣herent
strength. Besides, the strong percep∣tion
will frequently recur to our view; and
as often as it occurs, it will readily suggest
such as are connected with it; it will commu∣nicate
strength to them, and make them to
be conceived with force and vivacity. On
this account also, if the idea of an object
comes, at any of its appearances in the me∣mory,
to be connected with another that is
strong, it will derive strength from this latter,
and in consequence of this be vigorously re∣membered,
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
though the objects had no con∣nexion
when they were originally perceived
by the senses. The truth of these observa∣tions
appears in many instances. It was to
assist the introduction of ideas by the force of
sensible signs, that the ancient orators used

often hear persons assign as a reason for their
retaining a thing strongly, some affecting pe∣culiarity
in their circumstances when they
first became acquainted with it, which has
united itself inseparably to it, and rendered
it impossible for them to forget it. We some∣times
want a person to recollect a particular
occurrence; we affirm again and again that
he was present at it; but he can remember
nothing of it: we mention something which
happened at the same time, or was otherwise
connected with it; he remembers this dis∣tinctly;
<PB N="259" REF="266"/>
the remembrance of it revives his
remembrance of that occurrence, bestows vi∣vacity
upon it, and renders it clearly percep∣tible.
If we have a high sense of the impor∣tance
of any subject, that sense makes every
thing related to this subject, to be strongly
remembered. The reason and the efficacy of
punishments depend very much on the prin∣ciple
now under consideration; the remem∣brance
of the pain or shame preserves the re∣membrance
of the fault, and by constantly
attending it, produces constant aversion to
the repetition of the fault, and care to avoid
it. We do not easily forget any thing related
to a person whom we love. What excites
desire, admiration, joy, fear, sorrow, or in
general any strong passion, is firmly remem∣bered;
the passion communicates force both
to the sensation and to the idea of the object
by which it was excited<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Aliae instantiae dabunt hane alteram speciem; ut quae faciunt impressionem in affectu forti, incutientes seilicet me∣rum, admirationem, pudorem, delectationem, juvent memo∣riam. VERULAM. <HI>Nov. Org.</HI> Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE are not always wholly passive in the
exercise of memory; we can make efforts to
remember what does not cast up to us readily
and of its own accord. This voluntary exer∣tion
of memory, is called <HI>recollection.</HI> As
<PB N="260" REF="267"/>
rememberance is assisted by the relations of
things, so recollection is altogether owing to
them. It would be absolutely impossible, if
there were not such a connexion among our
ideas, as enables one of them when excited,
to bring another into view. We cannot call
up an idea <HI>directly</HI> by an act of the will.
We cannot will to raise that particular idea
which we want; for this would imply that
we conceived it already, and needed not to
raise it by a volition: and if we have not al∣ready
conceived it, we will to raise we know
not what idea. It is only <HI>indirectly</HI> that we
raise an idea by a volition. The idea which
we want, has some relations to certain others;
these others, with the relations which they
bear to that, may be in our view; we can
voluntarily set out from these, and pursue the
several relations which belong to them, till
we fall upon that relation which leads to the
idea wanted. The least reflection on what
passes in our own minds, will convince us
that this is the very way which we take in
recollecting. We are just like persons in
search of something which they have lost,
they know not precisely where: but by their
knowing the place where they first missed it,
by their recollecting when they last had it, by
<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
their remembering all the places they have
been in since, and by their thinking what
might be the occasion of their losing it, their
search is reduced within some bounds, and
they have some direction in it, whereas other∣wise
they had been obliged to seek for it at
perfect random. In the same manner, in
consequence of the connexion which subsists
among different ideas, we may have a sort of
anticipation of one which is not yet present
to the mind, a notion of some relation which
it bears to another that is present; and by
that notion we are in the proper track for
finding it, and following this track are quick∣ly
led to it. Hence verses are not only more
easily committed to memory, than prose, but
also more readily recollected: when we are
at a loss about a word, we know before-hand
that it must be such as will agree not only
with the sense but also with the measure.
Hence order and a regular distribution is a
great assistance in recollecting a discourse: if
a particular period occur not readily, we know
at least that it must be such as suits a certain
part of the plan<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Verum et in his quae scripsimus, complectendis, mul∣tum valent, et in iis quae cogitamus, continendis, prope solae (excepta quae potissima est, exercitatione) divisio et compositio.

As an idea is recollected only by our follow∣ing
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
some relation which we know that it
bears to another, it is evident that its bearing
several different relations to that other, will
facilitate our recollection of it. Any one of
these relations may conduct us to it; and we
may light upon one of them when we have
missed another. We often remember a dis∣course,
when we have forgotten the speaker;
if we retain but a few circumstances of the
time and place, these may lead us equally to
several persons, among whom we cannot dis∣tinguish
the real speaker: but if we retain a
great number of circumstances, as the tone
of voice and the manner in which it was told,
the number, situation, and other circumstan∣ces
of the company, some or other of these
will lead us to ascertain the very speaker.
All the circumstances together will lead us to
recollect the idea which we want, both more
quickly and more strongly than one or a few
of them could have done; they will draw it
into the mind with a sort of impetuosity,
which at once accelerates its motion, and ena∣bles
it to strike us with greater force: for in
the exercise of memory, as well as in the
exertions of imagination, several relations
operating together, act with a compound
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
force<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Aliae instantiae dabunt hane alteram speciem; ut mul∣titudo circumstantiarum, sive ansarum, juvet memoriam: ve∣luti scriptio per partes non continuatas, lectio sive recitatio voce alta. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE>. At the same time, the greater the
number of circumstances are, the stronger is
the conviction attending our recollection, and
the more absolute the certainty of our being
in the right. What has been said concerning
recollection, is fully illustrated by the follow∣ing
example:</P>

<P>Thus those connexions of ideas which cause
them to succeed one another of their own ac∣cord
in a regular train, subject this train, at
the same time, to the power of the will in a
certain degree, and enable us to alter it, in
many instances, at our pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="272"/>
THE voluntary exertion of the memory in
recollection, is very analogous to the exercise
of imagination in producing a work of genius;
for in this exercise, as well as in that exer∣tion,
the will has always some concern: it de∣termines
the subject, and it is continually em∣ployed
in choosing the proper tracts of thought.
If it were not employed in this, genius must
go on like a mere machine, and a person
should have no power over it after it were
once set in motion. In what manner the will
mixes itself with the operations of the ima∣gination,
and influences them, may be under∣stood
from the account of recollection, which
we have now given. Recollection, and the
voluntary exercise of imagination, differ chiefly
in two things. First, in the end proposed.
We properly recollect, when all that we
desire, is to recal to memory something
which we have observed; and in recalling
it, we are often assisted by fancy; for we may
be led to it, not only by its observed con∣nexions
with other things, but also by any
relations to them, which imagination has be∣stowed.
We voluntarily exert imagination,
when our intention is, merely to gather toge∣ther
such ideas as suit our present work; and
in gathering them together, real connexions
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
preserved by memory, are often of great ser∣vice
to us. Secondly, when we properly re∣collect
ideas, they are no sooner brought into
our view, than we have a conviction that ei∣ther
they themselves, or the objects from which
they are derived, have been formerly perceived
by us; and that conviction is attended to by
the mind: when the ideas are brought into
view by the imagination, either we have no
such conviction, or we take no notice of it.
These two, recollection and the exercise of
imagination, are conjoined in producing every
work of genius, but not equally in works of
all kinds, nor in the genius of all persons.</P>
<P>THE observations which we have hitherto
made, regard the different operations in which
memory is exerted; and they show the influ∣ence
which these several operations have upon
genius. But there are likewise differences of
another sort incident to memory, such as affect
all its operations, and produce varieties in its
form and power. All these differences may
be explained from the principles already laid
down, either from those which regard separate
thoughts, or from those which regard their
connexions, or from both together. By con∣sidering
the most remarkable of these differ∣ences,
those principles will be farther con∣firmed
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
and illustrated, and some additional
observations concerning genius, will be sug∣gested.</P>
<P>THE memory of the same person is not
equally perfect in all the periods of his life.
Memory is weak in very young children,
and in very old men; but the weakness pro∣ceeds
from dissimilar causes. The former are
not capable either of bestowing so close atten∣tion
upon things, or of comprehending them
so perfectly, as would be necessary for their
making a strong or lasting impression on the
memory. In the latter, all the powers of per∣ception
are become dull, nothing can strike
them so deeply as to infix itself in the me∣mory.
That this is the real cause of the de∣cay
of memory by age, is evident from the
common remark, that old persons forget what
happened yesterday, but remember distinctly
what occurred many years ago: could re∣cent
events affect their deadened organs with
equal force, their remembrance of them would
be equally tenacious<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. In the former part
of youth, memory is very firm: many causes
then concur to make all our perceptions strong,
and consequently durable; the mind is not
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
pre-occupied; the spirits are lively; curiosity
is high; every thing being new, strikes with
its full force; admiration is easily raised, and
all the passions strong, and fit for communi∣cating
vigour to the perceptions which occa∣sion
them. In the age of maturity, many of
these causes of strong remembrance cease: but
their place is in a considerable degree supplied
by others; things are more perfectly under∣stood;
the connexions of perceptions are more
fully perceived; and memory is improved by
habit. It is in youth and maturity, that ge∣nius
exerts itself with greatest power: in
childhood it has scarce begun to dawn; in old
age it sinks into a glimmering twilight. Were
it only on account of the assistance from me∣mory
of which it stands in need, it must be in
some measure subject to these changes. But
this is not the only or the principal cause of
its being subject to them; the powers on
which it has a more immediate and essential
dependence, are subject to the same changes.
It is a general law of our nature, that all our
faculties rise gradually to their perfection, and
gradually decline.</P>
<P>MEMORY admits much greater varieties
in different persons, varieties both in degree
and in kind.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276"/>
THERE are chiefly four perfections of which
memory is capable. These are rarely united
in the same person; and the prevalence of one
of them, or the manner and degree in which
they are united, produces very great diversi∣ties
in the memories of different persons.
Some of the perfections of memory arise from
the strength with which separate perceptions
are remembered, others from the ability of
remembering their connexions firmly.—It is
a perfection of memory to be <HI>susceptible,</HI> to
receive an impression quickly: it is likewise
a perfection of memory to be <HI>tenacious</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ejus duplex virtus, facile percipere, et fideliter conti∣nere. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. i. cap. 4.</NOTE>.
Both these perfections arise chiefly from a fit∣ness
for remembering separate perceptions:
but they do not always go together; nay,
they who commit a thing quickly to memory,
generally forget it soonest. This may seem
to contradict the maxim, that perceptions ori∣ginally
strong, are firmly remembered. But
it is perfectly consistent with it. Because the
impression is made quickly, it does not follow
that it is strong: a susceptible memory, like a
soft body, receives some impression at once,
and because this impression is perceivable at
once, we are at no pains to deepen it, we al∣low
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
it to continue slight: when the memory
is, as it were, of a harder contexture, the im∣pression
is not made without continued labour,
it is deep before it can be at all taken notice
of, and therefore it is permanent<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Etiam illa praevelox sere cito essluit, et velut praesenti officio functa nihil in posterum debeat, tanquam dimissa dis∣cedit. Nec est mirum magis haerere animo, quae diutius affixa sint. QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Some∣times
these perfections are united: the me∣mory
is of such a happy temperature as may
be compared to wax, which receives the seal
easily and strongly when it is melted, and im∣mediately
hardens and suffers it not to be
effaced. Of these two perfections, the former
is in its nature and principles most congenial
to genius; but the latter is at least equally
subservient to its operations; for no percep∣tion
can be suggested by fancy or applied to
any purpose, except it be remembered.—It is
a perfection of memory to be <HI>distinct,</HI> to ex∣hibit
things in their proper form and order:
it is also a perfection to be <HI>ready,</HI> to call to
mind easily and quickly such ideas as we have
occasion for. Distinctness relates to such things
as are in our view together; readiness, to such
as make their appearance in succession. They
are inseparable, and always take place almost
in the same degree. They arise from the same
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
principle, from a natural aptitude to retain the
relations of things. The memory cannot in∣deed
be distinct, except the several separate
perceptions be well retained; the omission of
one part or member would destroy the har∣mony
of the whole: but distinctness arises
immediately from a lively remembrance of
their connexions; if this were wanting, all
the particulars would lie jumbled in confusion.
It is, in like manner, when the connexions of
things are strongly perceived, that some of
them introduce others readily. If in some
cases there be distinctness of remembrance
without readiness of recollection, the defect in
this latter virtue is owing to the weakness and
inactivity of imagination, failing to exert it∣self
at the proper time. In proportion to the
degree in which these perfections of memory
are possessed, they must render the energies of
genius the more perfect, and likewise affect
the form of its productions, so far as it em∣ploys
in them materials borrowed from me∣mory.
Confusion in a work may proceed
from indistinctness of remembrance, as well
as from irregularity of imagination: not only
feebleness of imagination, but also slowness of
recollection, may render a work both labori∣ous
and meagre. Besides these defects, con∣fusion
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
and slowness, which are directly opposed
to the excellences of memory now under
consideration, there is an imperfection which
bears a relation to both these excellences,
which seems to resemble them, but in truth
only mimics them; I mean, the remembrance
of things merely by rote, when a person can
run over things exactly, in their observed or∣der,
and be certain of recollecting any part of
them by thus running over them, but can re∣member
nothing, if he be put out of that
train. In this case, the separate perceptions
are faintly impressed upon the mind, their ex∣perienced
connexions strongly; and these are
the only connexions which influence it, the
relations conferred by imagination have none;
the subject likewise is not clearly understood.
These being the causes of this peculiarity of
memory, it can seldom be found along with
genius, or indeed with a great degree of any
of the intellectual powers.</P>
<P>MEMORY admits likewise varieties in kind;
and these varieties tend more directly than
any hitherto mentioned, to diversity the form
of genius.</P>
<P>MANY causes were formerly pointed out,
which may render perceptions strong and
strongly remembered. Any one of these causes
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
may render any perception or class of percep∣tions
strongest and most affecting to a par∣ticular
person: by some or other of these
causes, different perceptions will unavoidably
be rendered strongest to different persons; and
these will, by consequence, dwell most in the
memory, and take the fastest hold of it. The
objects of strong remembrance will thus be
necessarily different in different men: and the
difference of these will occasion a correspon∣dent
difference in the exertions of genius, and
that with respect both to the perceptions from
which it sets out, and to those which it after∣wards
collects.</P>
<P>FIRST, the peculiar turn of memory will
affect genius, by determining, in many in∣stances,
the perception from which it sets out,
in its investigations or its compositions. Every
invention, it was already shown, takes its rise
from some present perception, which suggests
the other ideas necessary in the work. If
that present perception be not actually sub∣jected
to the senses, it must be a perception
exhibited by memory. Memory will most
readily exhibit those perceptions which it re∣tains
strongly; for it is a never-failing effect
of strong remembrance, to cause a perception
occur often, and remain almost constantly in</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281"/>
our view, so that it cannot be banished with∣out
difficulty, sometimes not at all. But the
present perception, which is thus often fixt by
the peculiar cast of memory, determines ge∣nius
to attach itself to such ideas as are con∣nected
with it, and to follow the road which
they point out; and consequently it influences
the whole series of the thoughts, and contri∣butes
not a little to the peculiar form which
the work assumes. Several different percep∣tions
being, by means of different principles,
strongly remembered by the same person, will
sit him for exercising his genius on different
subjects: they will also lead him to works of
different kinds; for in some sorts of percep∣tions
one relation is more conspicuous and
aptest to lay hold of the imagination, and in
other sorts another relation; and our follow∣ing
one or the other, will produce a work of
one species, or of a different species. The
perceptions strongly remembered being much
more various in different persons, than they
can be in the same person, will produce a pro∣portionably
greater variety, both in the sub∣jects
which they choose for the exercise of ge∣nius,
and in the species of works in which
they engage.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282"/>
SECONDLY, the particular things which are
strongly remembered by a person, will directly
influence the ideas introduced, as well as the
perception from which he sets out. Imagi∣nation
can exhibit only such ideas as a person
has; ideas which he has lost, whatever is for∣gotten,
cannot possibly be suggested, nor em∣ployed
in any work of genius. By an inca∣pacity
of retaining certain sorts of ideas firmly,
a man may be necessarily prevented from using
materials which he once possessed, however fit
they would have been for compleating or
adorning his work. The ideas to which his
memory is adapted, compose the stock which
he can employ. Besides, of the ideas which
he retains, those which are retained most
strongly, will recur oftenest to his view, and
consequently will be most familiar to him. On
this account they will occur and be employed
by him, more readily than any others. Ideas
by being strongly remembered, force them∣selves
frequently into our view, and engage
our attention, when there is no particular oc∣casion
to introduce them: undoubtedly then,
when they are related to a subject on which
we are exercising our genius, they will be sug∣gested
more readily, than other ideas equally,
or even more nearly related to that subject,
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
but not so strongly fixt in our memory. Thus
the whole complexion of a work is necessarily
tinged by the kind of thoughts which the
memory of the author is fitted to retain with
greatest strength and clearness: and hence
must arise very great diversity in the produc∣tions
of different persons, even on the same
subject; diversities proportioned to the num∣ber
of ways in which the perceptions of me∣mory
may be strong, either in themselves, or
by communication from those with which
they are connected.</P>
<P>ALL the observed connexions of things lay
hold of the memory in some degree; but they
do not all equally lay hold of the memory of
every man. One person's memory retains some
connexions most strongly; another person's
retains chiefly quite different connexions.
One consequence of this is, that if two per∣sons
give an account of any object which they
remember, their descriptions of it will be con∣siderably
different. Were they to introduce
representations of that object into works of
genius, there would be a correspondent dissi∣militude
between these representations. There
would be a difference likewise in the uses to
which they were applied; for by being put
into different attitudes, the same object is
<PB N="277" REF="284"/>
adapted to different purposes. Another con∣sequence
is, that the memories of different
persons are suited to different subjects. Some
are especially ready in remembering reason∣ings,
and such phenomena and processes in
nature as are the proper subjects of reasoning;
the connexions of things as causes and effects,
make the strongest impression on their me∣mory.
Some retain most firmly the form and
structure of natural bodies, or descriptions of
them; their memory is chiefly affected by
the co-existence of the parts. Others retain
best, trains of events, or relations of them in
history; vicinity, order, and that species of
causation by which events depend on one ano∣ther,
are the connexions which suit their me∣mory.
Others are remarkable for easily re∣membering
poetry; the relations of ideas
which prevail in it, lay fastest hold on their
memory: many of these relations are origi∣nally
bestowed upon the parts solely by ima∣gination;
but after they are bestowed, and the
work is read, they become observed connex∣ions
of the parts of that work, and are proper
objects of memory. Those things which are
peculiarly suitable to a person's memory, are
generally those to which his understanding and
his taste are most adapted. This suggests a
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
reason why they are peculiarly suitable to his
memory: they are the subjects to which he
can attend most easily and most closely, into
which he can enter most deeply, and from
which he receives the greatest pleasure; they
cannot therefore fail to make a strong and last∣ing
impression on him. Their making such
an impression on him, will necessarily have an
influence on the turn of his genius. Every
man will introduce into his works chiefly those
subjects which he remembers best, if they can
at all suit his purpose. Both the illustrations
and the episodes of one poet, relate almost con∣stantly
to natural things; those of another are
generally taken from history, or consist of nar∣ration;
a third abounds on every occasion
with moral sentiments, or runs out into philo∣sophical
speculations. The peculiar congruity
of different connexions to different memories,
contributes to produce variety of genius, in
the same manner, though not in so great a
degree, as the predominance of one associat∣ing
principle; for exertions of memory enter

<HEAD>SECT. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Varieties of Judgment, and their
Influence on Genius.</HEAD>
<P>IF we recollect, how constantly judgment
attends imagination, and in how many
ways it assists and regulates it, in all the exer∣tions
of genius, we cannot doubt that the
diversities of which judgment is susceptible,
will contribute greatly to the variety of ge∣nius
observable among men. To investigate
the several powers of judgment, and to ascer∣tain
the foundation of our several convictions
and reasonings, is a principal subject in all
treatises concerning human understanding;
but it is our business to consider judgment
only so far as its varieties affect the operations
of genius.</P>
<P>WHEN in the analysis of genius we distin∣guish
judgment from sense, memory, and
imagination, we use the term in its most ex∣tensive
signification. Taken in this extent,
it is of two kinds, judgment of <HI>truth,</HI> and
judgment of <HI>beauty.</HI> To the former, the
name is most commonly appropriated: the
latter is called <HI>taste.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="287"/>
TRUTH regards either real existence, or
the relations of general ideas: judgment is
exercised about both; and about each it is
exercised in different ways, sometimes intui∣tively,
at other times by reasoning, sometimes
producing certainty, and at other times only
probability. It includes all the intellectual
faculties by which we distinguish truth from
falsehood, embrace and assent to the one, and
disbelieve and reject the other<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The author was led, many years ago, by the office which he then held, to enquire with some care, into theseveral modifications of judgment, the kinds of evidence correspondent to them, and the nature and degree of convic∣tion produced by them. New light has been thrown on several branches of this subject, by Dr. Reid's ingenious <HI>Inquiry;</HI> and the whole of it has been illustrated with great perspicuity and elegance, in Dr. Beattie's <HI>Essay on Truth,</HI> Part I. The present design admits the consideration of this subject, only in one very confined point of view, as connected with the vari∣eties of genius.</NOTE>. Men dif∣fer
either in the degree in which they possess
the same species of judgment, or in the species
of judgment which they are most prone to
exercise, and exercise in greatest perfection.</P>
<P>THE faculties by which we perceive such
truths as regard the relations of general ideas,
are commonly known.</P>
<P>SELF-EVIDENT truths are perceived by <HI>in∣tuition</HI>
which exerts itself in an infallible
conviction that certain relations belong to the
ideas compared, and cannot but belong to
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
them; and this conviction arises on the mere
comparison of the ideas themselves, without
any reasoning. In all the proper subjects of
intuition, we perceive the relation to be im∣plied
in the very nature of the ideas, so that it
must appear the same to every being, capable
of comparing them.</P>
<P>SUCH relations of ideas as are not self-evi∣dent,
can be perceived only by <HI>reason.</HI> None
but the <HI>necessary</HI> relations of ideas can be de∣duced
by reason, merely by comparison of the
ideas themselves; at least these are the only
relations which can be in this way deduced
with such certainty as to make it worth while
to attempt deducing them. The reasoning
by which such relations are deduced, is called
demonstration. In order to our perceiving the
force of a demostration, we must perceive
the truth of all the steps of which it consists.
But it is not properly by an exertion of rea∣son,
that we perceive the truth of each sepa∣rate
step. Often the conviction is intuitive;
as when in the course of a demonstration we
assume the equality of two sides of a triangle,
which are radii of the same circle. Even
such propositions as have been formerly de∣monstrated,
when they are applied in a sub∣sequent
demonstration, cannot in that case be
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
strictly ascribed to reason; for though it was
reason that first produced a conviction of their
truth, it is memory that retains, and either
memory or imagination that presents, the
conviction in the present case; and generally
the convition is presented alone, without the
proofs to which it was originally owing. In
order to our deducing a conclusion from a
series of argumentation, it is necessary that
we retain all the steps of that series; if any of
them be forgotten, we cannot perceive the
evidence of the conclusion; and it is by me∣mory
that they are retained. In consequence
of all this, a conclusion is inferred from the
whole argument: the inferring of this con∣clusion,
and the prodution of a conviction
of its truth, are the only exertions of reason,
as distinguished from our other intellectual
powers. Reason, so far as it is employed in
demonstration, is that faculty by which we
draw inferences from the comparison of our
ideas, or obtain a conviction that a relation
subsists between two ideas, by our having
found that these bear certain relations to other
ideas. This is an original faculty of the hu∣man
mind. It is the more perfect, the more
easily, the more quickly, and in the more in∣stances
we can infer conclusions by the compa∣rison
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
of our ideas. It is possessed by different
men in very different degrees of perfection.
These doubtless are owing principally to an
original diversity in the faculty of reason it∣self;
but as it is attended and aided in all its
exertions, by memory, and in some of them
by imagination also, its varieties may arise in
part from the degree of these latter powers
which men possess, and from the particular
modification of them which prevails. If a
man's memory be remarkably turned for re∣taining
the relations of ideas, and his imagi∣nation
for suggesting them, this will assist him
greatly in perceiving the connexion of the
several steps of a demostration, and in re∣taining
them all, and will thus make his rea∣son
appear the more acute. But if his memory
and fancy had been ill adapted to such sub∣jects,
he must, even with the same share of
reason, have run a risk of being perplexed in
pursuing a long train of argumentation.</P>
<P>THE existence and the connexions of real
things, are the subjects of very many of our
judgments. The exertions of understanding
employed about them, are different from
those which are employed about the relations
of ideas, and likewise admit great variety.
The existence of real things, and their con∣nexions,
<PB N="284" REF="291"/>
are perceived intuitively; they are infer∣red
by an immediate judgment of Nature; they
are deduced by a train of consequences; they
are believed on the testimony of others: they
are known with certainty; or they are assented
to as probable in a greater or a less degree.</P>
<P>EVERY man is conscious of his own sensa∣tions,
ideas, thoughts, passions, and the se∣veral
operations of his own mind; and while
he is conscious of them, he is convinced of
their present existence. The judgment which
produces this conviction, is implied in the
very nature of consciousness, and complicated
with every act of it. It is a judgment dif∣ferent
in kind from our intuitive perception
of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
which we compare; but it is equally imme∣diate,
equally unavoidable, and is even a pre∣requisite
to that perception.</P>
<P>EVERY sensation, every idea, which a man
has, every operation, every passion, of which
he is conscious, suggests the notion of him∣self,
and enables him, without any exercise
of reason, without any information from ex∣perience,
by a natural and inexplicable prin∣ciple,
to infer the existence of himself as the
percipient and agent. The inference is im∣mediate,
and without any comparison of
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
ideas; it is likewise indubitable, the original
constitution of our nature will not allow us to
call it in question.</P>
<P>WHENEVER we have a sensation by means
of our bodily organs, we infer from it some
quality in bodies, which is the cause or occa∣sion
of it. There is an inference: but it is
made without any reasoning or comparison of
ideas; we can perceive no necessary connexion
between the sensation and the quality inferred
from it: the inference is made previous to
experience: it is made by a judgment of na∣ture;
our belief of it arises from an original
and inexplicable principle of the mind, which
determines us to it immediately and irresis∣tibly.</P>
<P>WE remember our sensations, the qualities
of bodies which they suggested, the passions
and the operations of our minds. The re∣membrance
of them implies a conviction of
their past existence, which is, like those al∣ready
mentioned, a judgment of nature, im∣mediate,
unavoidable, and indubitable, to
which every man is determined by his consti∣tution,
and of which no other account can
be given.</P>
<P>WE can compare the several objects about
which the mind employs itself, whether they
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
be its own operations, or the qualities of bo∣dies;
the comparison suggests a great variety
of connexions and relations belonging to
them; and about all these, judgment is exer∣cised
in many different ways.—It perceives
the <HI>resemblance</HI> of some things, and the dissi∣militude
of others: it perceives both intui∣tively,
and it perceives them on comparison of
the things themselves or of their ideas. Should
we miss forming the judgment immediately,
we can never be brought to form it by argu∣ment;
we can only be led to bestow greater
attention, that, by our becoming more per∣fectly
acquainted with the objects, the intui∣tive
faculty may exert itself to greater advan∣tage.
—When we compare some things
together, we perceive their <HI>contrariety;</HI> some∣times
we perceive it intuitively, and some∣times
experience of the things themselves, or
of their causes, or of their consequences, is
necessary for our forming the judgment.—
When things possess any quality in common,
judgment may be employed in deciding con∣cerning
the <HI>degree</HI> of that quality: the judg∣ment
is often intuitive; it may however be
aided by continued and repeated attention;
and it is sometimes produced by a mixture of
experiment and reasoning. When experi∣ments
<PB N="287" REF="294"/>
are made for enlightening the judg∣ment,
they tend to exhibit the qualities more
perfectly to the mind; the reasoning that is
introduced, regards the causes or the effects
of the qualities compared, or serves for esta∣blishing
their connexion with some pheno∣mena
which cast up in the course of the
experiment, and from which their degrees
may be inferred. A thermometer is employed
for ascertaining the degrees of heat; it shows
immediately the degrees of expansion in the
fluid; and experience teaches us the constant
connexion between these degrees and the de∣grees
of heat.—Real things bear to one
another, certain <HI>proportions</HI> in their quantity
or their number: judgment is exercised about
these; sometimes it perceives them intui∣tively,
and at other times it deduces them by
various kinds of reasoning.—When we
consider objects which have a continued ex∣istence,
we perceive their <HI>identity,</HI> or we
judge them to be different from, however
similar to those which we had observed for∣merly.
In this case, our judgment is some∣times
intuitive, on our comparing the present
object with our idea of that which we had be∣fore
perceived; and sometimes it is the result of
reasoning. When it is intuitive, it is, generally
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
at least, rather a judgment resolvable into
our constitution, than a perception of neces∣sary
agreement or disagreement: when it is
the result of reasoning, the reasoning is found∣ed
on our experience of the ordinary dura∣tion
of the several kinds of things, of the
changes which they are capable of undergo∣ing,
and of other circumstances relating to
themselves and their causes.—Things have
different relations in <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place:</HI> judg∣ment
cannot discover these by a mere compa∣rison
of the things, but by experience and
observation.—It is in the same way, that
we judge concerning the co-existence of qua∣lities:
we can perceive intuitively that some
qualities are inconsistent or incapable of be∣ing
co-existent; in some few cases also, one
quality implies another, so that their co-ex∣istence
is self-evident, as figure and extension
are inseparable: but in most cases, even after
experience has shown that certain qualities
are actually co-existent, we can find out no
necessary bond of union among them.—
There is a principle in our constitution, which
determines us irresistibly, without reasoning
or proof, to judge that there is some cause of
every new existence, and of every change
which things undergo. We have a natural
<PB N="289" REF="296"/>
propensity to consider particular things as
causes or effects, we pronounce them such,
not from any comparison of their qualities, or
any perception of the fitness of the one to
produce the other, but from experience of
their conjunction. With respect to objects
which we have all our lives judged to stand
in this relation, it is often the subject of intri∣cate
and uncertain investigation, what are the
qualities which fit them for bearing this rela∣tion
to one another, and often we remain
altogether ignorant of this.</P>
<P>THERE is an original principle in our na∣ture,
which determines us to judge, That the
future will resemble the past, and instances of
which we have had no experience, those of
which we have had experience. As God has
made the course of nature uniform and con∣stant,
so he has formed us for placing implicit
confidence in its uniformity and constancy,
for expecting the continuance of those con∣nexions
of things, which we have hitherto
observed. This principle is inexplicable; the
judgment to which it leads us, is immediate
and independent upon arguments. It is the
foundation of all our reasonings concerning
real things. Guided by it, we conclude,
what will be, from our experience of what
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
has been; the particular judgments which ex∣perience
has dictated, we extend beyond the
instances of which we have had experience,
and render general: we believe that those
qualities which we have observed to be co∣existent,
will in all similar instances be co∣existent,
that causes will constantly produce
such effects, and effects require such causes
as they formerly have. It is to this original
principle in human nature, that we owe our
conviction in all our reasonings from expe∣rience.
But this principle, simple and uni∣form
in itself, admits great variety, and is
complicated with many exertions of the un∣derstanding,
in its application to particular
subjects. It will therefore be proper to make
some observations upon it.</P>
<P>OUR experience of the past and of what we
are acquainted with, is the ground on which
we form all our judgments concerning the
future, and what is unknown to us. Expe∣rience
is the result of a number of particular
observations. Attention to the several in∣stances
as they occurred, and distinct remem∣brance
of them afterwards, are necessary for
our acquiring experience; and men's expe∣rience
in the same circumstances, will be
greater or less in proportion to their propen∣sity
<PB N="291" REF="298"/>
to attend to what passes before them, and
their ability to remember it.—In every in∣stance,
the circumstances which are of im∣portance
for forming experience, are found
in conjunction with others which are of no
importance: there is a natural sagacity fit for
distinguishing these, which different men pos∣sess
in very different degrees; and in propor∣tion
to the degree of it which a man possesses,
his experience will be more or less exact and
precise. Experience is not merely the re∣membrance
of a number of unconnected ob∣servations:
it is a judgment formed with
sagacity from them all together<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. It is
formed by means of a sort of abstracting
power, which separates the necessary circum∣stances
from the accidental: and the kind and
degree of conviction that attends it, corre∣sponds
to the particular relation or connexion
of the things, on which our observation is
fixt. In some cases, there is little difficulty
in forming such a judgment with precision;
there are few accidental and unimportant cir∣cumstances
joined with the necessary and im∣portant
<PB N="292" REF="299"/>
ones. In other cases, the unimportant
circumstances are so many, and so much
blended with the important, that it requires
superior acuteness to separate them: though
the particular instances be perfectly remem∣bered,
yet often no experience is derived
from them, or experience very inaccurate,
and unfit for being applied to any use. This
difficulty is the primary cause of all the un∣certainty
and all the intricacies which attend
our reasonings from experience, and of all
the errors into which we are apt to fall in
such reasonings. For want of a degree of
acuteness sufficient to surmount the difficulty,
we form false judgments of the connexions of
things, in the very instances which we have
had access to observe: and if we attempt to
reason from these instances, the falsehood
cannot fail to be communicated to all the con∣clusions
which we infer.</P>
<P>AFTER we have collected experience, in
order to our reasoning from it, it is necessary
that it be recollected and brought into our
view when we have occasion for it. This is
the work of imagination. The instance con∣cerning
which we want to draw a conclusion,
is associated with the similar instances of which
we have had experience, and suggests them.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="300"/>
Their being readily and perfectly suggested,
depends partly on the force of the memory
retaining them distinctly, and partly on the
vigour of the imagination, on the strength
and activity of that associating principle which
connects them with the present instance.
Often when we have had very extensive ex∣perience,
we are rendered incapable of draw∣ing
a conclusion from it, by its not being
suggested at the time when it would be use∣ful.
In all our experimental reasonings,
imagination must be exerted; and conse∣quently
men's capacity for such reasonings,
must in some measure depend on the degree
in which they possess that faculty<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Perceptions of sight suggesting ideas of tangible quali∣ties, have been considered by some philosophers as a judgment, by others as an effect of association. What has been just now said, accounts for this difference, and shows that both are partly right. Both judgment and imagination are concerned. There was a judgment originally formed of the connexion be∣tween the visible and the tangible qualities; but it is imagina∣tion that enables the perception of the former to suggest the idea of the latter, and to suggest it so quickly and easily, that this idea is confounded with that perception.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN our past experience is suggested, we
compare the thing of which we want to judge,
with that experience, that we may discern
whether it corresponds to it or not. The
power of determining this justly, is of the
same kind with that sagacity which enables
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
us to collect accurate experience: it is the
same principle exerted in a different manner,
and in somewhat different circumstances: and
on our having this power in perfection, sound∣ness
of judgment in all our reasonings from
experience, very much depends. Those men
who are defective in it, draw their conclusions
from instances nowise similar; and therefore
their conclusions are erroneous or inaccurate.</P>
<P>WHEN experience is collected, suggested,
and applied to the instance in question, a con∣clusion
is drawn wholly by means of that ori∣ginal
principle already mentioned, which leads
us to expect the continuance of things and
their connexions, according to our past ex∣perience.
When our past experience has been
both extensive and uniform, and the present
instance exactly corresponds to it, we draw
the conclusion with <HI>certainty:</HI> if any of these
three circumstances be wanting, if we have
had experience only in a few instances, or if
there has been a contrariety in our experi∣ence,
or if the instances of which we have
had experience, do not exactly resemble the
present instance, the conclusion is attended
only with <HI>probability,</HI> and embraced with
different degrees of <HI>opinion</HI> proportioned to
the degrees of probability. The last of these
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
cases is distinguished by the name of <HI>analo∣gical</HI>
reasoning. The varieties of assent in all
of them, necessarily result from the nature of
that principle to which they are owing.</P>
<P>THE several operations of the mind which
are thus united in reasoning from, experience,
assist and promote one another. A propensity
to observe and attend to the several instances
which occur to us, gives sagacity a great ad∣vantage
for collecting general experience from
them; it fixes them also deeply in the me∣mory;
and renders it easier for imagination
to suggest them when we have occasion for
them. A natural sagacity in gathering cor∣rect
experience, promotes, in its turn, atten∣tion
to the objects which fall under our obser∣vation,
and gives it such a direction as makes
it most useful, by rendering our ideas of the
experienced instances determinate and distinct;
it likewise gives imagination the means of
introducing them. It was observed already,
that a capacity of acquiring accurate experi∣ence,
is absolutely necessary for our drawing
just conclusions: it is proper to observe on
the other hand, that the faculty employed in
drawing such conclusions, when improved by
exercise, gives great assistance in acquiring
farther experience. The conclusions them∣selves
<PB N="296" REF="303"/>
also which we have deduced from ex∣perience,
are useful for enabling us to collect
experience with greater ease, and with greater
correctness. Every just conclusion with which
we become acquainted, throws new light on
the face of nature, gives us a more extensive
view of its course and its laws, and enables
us to correct some error, to ascertain some
ambiguity, or to define some indistinctness,
in our former observations even concerning
objects which are most familiar to us. Our
<HI>primary</HI> experience is derived from particular
instances which have fallen under our obser∣vation:
from it we deduce conclusions, which
we adopt and rest in: and the maxims im∣plied
in these conclusions, form a sort of
<HI>secondary</HI> experience, by which the primary
is extended, limited, or corrected, and by
which sagacity is aided in forming new expe∣riences
with greater acuteness, facility, and
assurance. This secondary experience has
been in some measure acquired, and the habit
formed of applying it to use, by every man,
long before he comes to the age of reflection,
or begins to attend to the operations of his
own mind. Even that principle which leads
us to judge, that the future will resemble the
past, and instances of which we have not had
<PB N="297" REF="304"/>
experience, those of which we have, is
strengthened and exerts itself with greater
assurance, in consequence of our being accus∣tomed
to draw conclusions from experience.
By means of this, we often allow certain be∣lief
to conclusions founded on experience of a
very few instances, sometimes even on a
single trial; we take it for granted that every
similar trial will turn out in the same way;
for we have experience of the stability of the
course of Nature, and this general experience
in some measure supplies the place of expe∣rience
in that particular case.</P>
<P>As there are thus several powers jointly
exerted in all our reasonings from experience,
it is only when all these powers exist in full
vigour, that the faculty of reasoning from
experience can be perfect. The different de∣grees
of these powers in different men, will
produce correspondent degrees of judgment
in matters of experience. The different pro∣portions
in which these powers are united,
will occasion varieties in the form which this
kind of judgment assumes, and in the subjects
to which it is adapted.</P>
<P>FINALLY, there is in our nature, an ori∣ginal
determination to give credit to the tes∣timony
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
of others<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See CAMPBELL'S <HI>Dissertation on Miracles,</HI> part i. sect. 1, 2. where this species of belief is explained with great ingenuity.</NOTE>. Did this determination
exert itself without any restraint, it would
lead us to believe whatever is said by others.
It would exert itself without restraint, if we
had never found ourselves deceived by others.
But experience teaches us that others are of∣ten
deceived, and that they sometimes intend
to deceive, and, in consequence of this disco∣very,
leads us to examine their testimony
before we assent to it. We consider the cha∣racters
and the number of the witnesses, the
ends which they may serve by deceiving us,
the motives which may urge them to attempt
it, their opportunities of knowing the truth;
and we estimate by these circumstances, the
degree of credibility which belongs to their
reports. We compare the subject of their
testimony with our own experience, and give
greater or less credit to it according to its
probability. In all this, there is ample scope
for the exercise of judgment. It is chiefly
the kind of judgment employed in reasoning
from experience, that is exercised in estimat∣ing
the degree of assent due to a particular
testimony: and it is by the conclusions and
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
maxims which we have deduced from expe∣rience,
that we restrain and limit our assent to
testimony. On the other hand, the informa∣tion
which we receive from the testimony of
others, is added to our own observations, be∣comes
a part of our experience, and extends
it, and is built upon as a foundation in our
experimental reasonings.</P>
<P>WE judge of beauty, as well as of truth:
the faculty by which we judge of it, is distin∣guished
by the name of <HI>taste.</HI> It likewise is
susceptible of great varieties, which contribute
to diversify the forms and exertions of genius.
The influence of taste does not, like that of
judgment, extend to all the kinds of genius;
and therefore we have not hitherto been led
to a particular consideration of it: it is suffi∣cient
to observe in general, That it influences
genius in producing beauty, in the same ways
in which judgment influences all the exertions
of genius. Indeed the effects formerly ascrib∣ed
to judgment<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Part I. sect. 4.</NOTE>, proceed in a great mea∣sure
from that species of it which we call
taste, in all such works of genius as are pro∣per
objects of taste.</P>
<P>THE varieties of taste are either in degree
or in kind. In every instance, it is a com∣pound
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
of judgment properly so called, and of
the internal senses<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Essay on Taste,</HI> Part II. sect. 2.</NOTE>. Both these may be
possessed in very different degrees of strength;
and every difference in the degree of either,
will produce a correspondent difference in the
degree of taste.—The taste of one man holds
chiefly of judgment, the taste of another man,
chiefly of the internal senses. This will ren∣der
their tastes different in kind. One set of
qualities are the proper objects of judgment,
another set immediately affect and exercise
the internal senses: the one set or the other
will be principally attended to and perceived
by a person, according as judgment or inter∣nal
sense is the prevailing principle in his
taste.—Each of these principles also is sus∣ceptible
of great varieties. The varieties of
judgment have been just now enumerated:
several of them enter into those exertions
which regard the objects of taste, fit men for
taking different views of these objects, and
give taste dissimilar turns. One judges best
of the proportion of the parts, another of
utility; each is most pleased with and sets the
highest value upon that quality of which he
is the most capable judge. The internal
senses are many, and are adapted to different
<PB N="301" REF="308"/>
subjects, or to the different qualities of the
same subject<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Essay on Taste, <HI>Part I.</HI></NOTE>: the predominance, there∣fore,
of any one of these senses will give taste
a correspondent form. One man is suscep∣tible
of strong impressions from grandeur and
sublimity; another has a quick feeling of the
beautiful and elegant: one has a taste for the
harmony of sounds, another for the graceful∣ness
of forms.</P>
<P>THE perfection of taste consists in <HI>sensibility,
resinement, correctness,</HI> and <HI>the just proportion
of its principles</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid▪</HI> Part II. sect. 4, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE>. In all these respects, the
tastes of different men differ extremely: we
find in individuals, all the intermediate de∣grees
between an almost total want of any of
these qualities, and the utmost perfection of
it.—A person may likewise possess one of these
perfections, while he is defective in the rest:
or, without being remarkably defective in any
of them, he may be eminent in one. Hence
will spring dissimilar kinds of taste.</P>
<P>OF the kinds of judgment which have been
enumerated, some belong in a nearly equal
degree to all men. Such is that intuitive
faculty by which we perceive the self-evident
relations of general ideas: such are our na∣tural
<PB N="302" REF="309"/>
judgments concerning the existence of
our perceptions and of the qualities and be∣ings
immediately suggested by them. Any
defect in these species of judgment, would
totally disqualify men for ordinary life.
These admitting no variety, can produce no
diversities of genius. Some philosophers
have not, indeed, allowed these their due
weight, and in consequence of that, have
attempted to establish paradoxes, and intro∣duce
scepticism inconsistent with them. But
this has not proceeded from their being desti∣tute
of these powers, or from their possessing
them in a less degree than other men; for
their behaviour in common life shows that
they pay sufficient regard to them: but it
has proceeded from their not reflecting upon
them, and explaining them to themselves, in
analyzing human nature. It is, therefore,
only an error in their theories, not a sign of
any imperfection in their constitution.</P>
<P>OTHER powers of judgment are possessed
by different men in very different degrees;
and some who excel in one kind, are defec∣tive
in another. They who have great
acuteness in mathematical and demonstrative
reasoning, sometimes betray great weakness in
arguing from experience, and judging con∣cerning
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
matters of fact. On the other hand,
there have been instances of persons, who
could scarce perceive the evidence of the ea∣siest
demonstration in Euclid's Elements, and
were incapable of apprehending mathematical
reasonings of length and intricacy; but could
judge very prudently in common life, draw
conclusions from experience with great ex∣actness,
and understand all the sciences which
consist of such conclusions. It is not surpris∣ing
that it should be so: for not only is that
reason by which we perceive the relations of
general ideas, different from that judgment
to which we owe our conviction in matters of
experience; but also in these two kinds of
reasoning, memory and imagination are ex∣erted
about different subjects, to which dif∣ferent
modifications of these powers are
adapted. Some have a talent in philosophical
reasonings, deducing the causes and the ge∣neral
laws of things from their phenomena,
or tracing the appearances which will result
from any supposed causes or laws, who never∣theless
are ill qualified for unravelling histo∣rical
doubts, or tracing the motives and the
consequences of human actions. Others are
great masters in reasoning concerning human
life, who have no great abilities for reason∣ings
<PB N="304" REF="311"/>
concerning human nature, the subject of
philosophical investigation most nearly allied
to that. Though conclusions of these dif∣ferent
kinds, be sometimes deduced from the
very same facts, yet for the deduction of
them, these facts must be set in different
lights, different circumstances of them must
be attended to, and a different sort of abstrac∣tion
exercised, as well as a different kind of
instances suggested by fancy for supporting
the conclusion. It happens much more fre∣quently,
that a person, along with great
powers of reason, possesses but imperfect
taste, or that a person of fine taste, is not
remarkable for vigour or depth of understand∣ing.
Every man will be prone to exercise
that kind of judgment in which he excels,
and to study the subjects which give scope to
it; and he will shun such subjects as require a
kind of judgment in which he is deficient:
the former kind will be improved by habit,
the latter will be impaired by neglect. Hence
the original differences of judgment will be
increased. The kinds of judgment which
thus admit variety in themselves, are they
that diversify the form and the exertions of
genius. In what manner they diversify them,
will appear from the following observations.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="312"/>
IMAGINATION cannot in any case perfect
its discoveries without the assistance of judg∣ment.
Imagination collects materials; a cer∣tain
kind and degree of judgment is necessary
for applying them to use. If they are not
applicable to any purpose which suits a per∣son's
turn of understanding or taste, or if he
has not a degree of these powers sufficient for
discerning that purpose and adapting the ma∣terials
to it, they will be thrown aside as use∣less,
or at most preserved in their indigested
form. Since the revival of natural philoso∣phy,
many have tried multitudes of experi∣ments,
who wanting the judgment necessary
for discerning the result of them, have not
been able to deduce any general conclusions
from them. There is a degree of imagina∣tion
requisite for contriving experiments;
there may be genius shown in conducting and
varying them; but it is genius only for na∣tural
history. Along with a turn of imagi∣nation
fit for leading from one experiment to
another, there is a strong propensity to attend
to the circumstances of particular facts: but
there is a weakness in the abstracting power,
and a defect in the other faculties employed
in reasoning from facts, which prevent the
mind's advancing to general deductions of
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
laws and causes. In order to produce philo∣sophical
genius, there must be superadded,
acuteness in discerning the result of experi∣ments,
and comparing them together, an ap∣titude
for recollecting observations as they be∣come
necessary, a propensity to search for
causes and connexions. A person possessed
of this cast of mind, will draw conclusions
from the appearances observed by others,
which they themselves could never have
thought of: and yet this person has not per∣haps
the turn of imagination, or the degree
of attention necessary for making all the trials
which they made. Possessed of genius for
natural <HI>science,</HI> he may be rather defective in
that kind of genius which serves to promote
natural <HI>history.</HI> Boyle had an admirable turn
for making experiments, he made many with
great accuracy on a variety of subjects; he
made some concerning the appearance of light
by the prism, he observed the oblong image
of rays refracted by means of it, he distin∣guished
that image into five different colours,
and he made some remarks upon this pheno∣menon<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>BOYLE</HI> Exper. et Considerat. de Coloribus, <HI>Par. III. Exp.</HI> 4.</NOTE>;
but he thought not of inferring
from it, the different degrees of refrangibility
in the rays of light. A different kind of
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
judgment, or a superior degree of the same kind
of judgment, enabled Newton, from the same
phenomenon, to form many conclusions on
this subject<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Optics,</HI> Book I.</NOTE>. Ever since electricity began
to attract the attention of the curious, many
persons have employed themselves in making
experiments relating to it, and have displayed
considerable ingenuity in making them; but
most of these have not discovered philosophi∣cal
or scientific ingenuity. It is to a very
few in the large catalogue of electricians, that
philosophical genius can be ascribed; for to
a very few is confined all that has been done
in accounting for the phenomena of electrical
experiments, and deducing important prin∣ciples
from them.</P>
<P>WHEN a person wants the kind or degree
of judgment necessary for applying the mate∣rials
which imagination has collected, to that
purpose of invention to which they might be
subservient, his genius is repressed, the dis∣appointment
tends to prevent his indulging
himself in again amassing materials of the
same sort, and to make him turn his fancy to
such works as, being more suitable to the turn
of his judgment, he can prosecute with suc∣cess.
By this means, his genius will be, still
more than it originally was, confirmed in that
<PB N="308" REF="315"/>
direction to which his powers of judgment
are best adapted. There are not wanting in∣stances
of persons who, finding their turn of
judgment and taste imperfectly adapted to
that species of exertion to which their imagi∣nation
had first prompted them, have quitted
it for another species to which they found
these powers more adequate, and in which
they could therefore become more correct.</P>
<P>THE same materials may be applied to dif∣ferent
purposes. They will be applied by
every person chiefly to that purpose which his
judgment best enables him to accomplish. If
the imaginations of two men were so similar
as to collect the very same materials, or to
suggest the same ideas; yet if their turns of
judgment be dissimilar, they will apply these
to purposes as dissimilar, and be unlike in the
particular form and in all the exertions of
their genius.</P>
<P>JUDGMENT not only receives the materials
selected by imagination, and forms them for
use, but also excites imagination, and sets it
a-working. The decisions of judgment, as
well as our sensations and ideas, are percep∣tions
which may give an impulse to imagina∣tion,
and direct it into a particular track of
thinking. Men's decisions upon the mate∣rials
<PB N="309" REF="316"/>
before them, will be different, according
to the species of judgment in which they ex∣cel;
and will give proportionably different
impulses to the imagination, and make it to
move in proportionably different directions.
On this account, judgment must have a strong
tendency to diversify the form of genius.
Genius takes very few steps in any investiga∣tion,
in any train of sentiment and thinking,
or in forming any design, without receiving
an impulse from judgment: through its whole
progress, conclusions and determinations are
intermixed closely and at very short intervals,
with the suggestions of fancy; and the con∣clusions
and determinations thus intermixed,
will always be such chiefly as proceed from
that modification of judgment in which the
person excells. A prevailing taste for the
Iudicrous, determined the genius of Peter di
Cosimo, though fit for producing greater
works, to such subjects of painting as ad∣mitted
only satyrs, harpies, and the like
whimsical and monstrous figures. It was the
correctest taste for beauty, continually regu∣lating
and instigating a fine imagination, that
produced the purity of design, the sweetness
of disposition, the propriety and grace, by
which Raphael is characterised. A defect in
<PB N="310" REF="317"/>
that taste rendered Correggio in some respects
incorrect and ungraceful, while a strong relish
for the sublime, prompting and directing an
imagination well formed for producing it,
bestowed upon him a peculiar greatness of
manner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF a man be defective in the species of
judgment requisite for any particular deter∣minations
or conclusions, so as not to form
them at all, or to form them wrong, when
they become necessary, his fancy will be at
a stand, his genius will be unable to carry
the work farther forward, or to improve it to
a higher degree of excellence. Did the judg∣ment
of an artist enable him to perceive the
particulars in which he is faulty, his genius
would often be sufficient to correct them;
their remaining therefore in his works, shows
that his judgment was not able to scrutinize
them properly: Titian relinquished the dry
manner of his master, which appeared in his
first paintings, as soon as his judgment was
improved enough to perceive and to disapprove
it; though Ludovico Carracci for some time
showed little genius for painting, yet after
his judgment was improved by the diligent
study of the works of great painters, it gave
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
his fancy so powerful an impulse, that he be∣came
excellent in design, colouring, and
grace<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">FRESNOY, ibid. Graham's account of painters.</NOTE>; without that improvement of judg∣ment,
the genius of these artists must have
remained defective. In every part of natural
science, experiments have been made with
great accuracy, by some who were not turned
for observing all the circumstances of the ex∣periments;
these circumstances have been
minutely observed by some who, for want of
the power of abstraction, could not determine
the result of the experiments; and some who
were capable of determining this, have been
hindered from pusuing the conclusions to
which it might have led, not only for want
of imagination sufficient for carrying on the
investigation, but also for want of the species
of judgment which must have been employed
in it.</P>
<P>THE same materials may give occasion for
determinations and conclusions of different
sorts: if a person possess only the kind of
judgment fit for forming one of these sorts,
immediately on forming them, he will leave
the road pursued by another who, possessing
a different kind of judgment, had formed
dissimilar conclusions, he will go forward in
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
a peculiar track, and arrive at a very distant
point. Newton formed a judgment concern∣ing
the unequal refraction of the rays of light,
from some of the simplest prismatical experi∣ments:
it was this judgment that suggested
to him the subsequent experiments proper for
ascertaining that principle, and gradually
opened up the wonderful course of observa∣tions
and the noble train of discoveries which
he made concerning light and colours; and
in the prosecution of these, both the most vi∣gorous
power of abstraction, and the most
piercing judgment of mathematical truth,
were continually exerted. Boyle was inferi∣our
to Newton in the former of these powers,
and possessed no great degree of the latter;
his turn of understanding led him not to form
the same conclusion from the most obvious
experiments; by not having formed it, his
genius was at a stand in deducing the laws of
refraction, he quitted the prismatic experi∣ments
without applying them to any use: but
he possessed judgment of another kind, and
by means of it, from a multitude of experi∣ments
deduced conclusions of a different na∣ture,
concerning the immediate causes of co∣lours
in particular bodies, and the methods of
producing them.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="320"/>
IT was already shown, That <HI>regularity</HI> of
imagination is an essential constituent of ge∣nius;
that this regularity consists in a capa∣city
of keeping the end of a work steadily in
view, and a propensity to subordinate the
parts to that end; and that, though it be pri∣marily
founded in a particular turn of the
imagination, it is promoted by the exercise
of judgment, and could not, without this,
attain tolerable perfection. It is judgment
that perceives when imagination deviates from
the paths which lead to the end proposed; it
is owing to this perception, that imagination
is recalled from its wanderings, and made to
set out anew in the right road; and it is the
frequent exercise of judgment in this employ∣ment,
that gives imagination an habitual re∣gularity
and correctness. This excellence of
imagination must therefore have a great de∣pendence
both on the <HI>degree</HI> and on the <HI>kind</HI>
of judgment which a person possesses.</P>
<P>THE acuter any species of judgment is, the
more readily, the more certainly, and the
more constantly, it will observe and check
every improper excursion of fancy. Genius
will therefore, in every man, acquire a degree
of correctness in some measure proportioned
to the exactness of his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="321"/>
FURTHER, the means adapted to different
ends, are connected with these ends by diffe∣rent
relations, and promote them in different
manners. According therefore to the variety
of the ends proposed, a different kind of judg∣ment
is necessary, for discerning, whether
the materials collected, have or have not a
tendency to promote them. On this account,
men's diversity in point of judgment will give
their imaginations different sorts of regula∣rity,
and consequently mould their genius
into different forms. Hence a person who
thinks and composes with great correctness
on one kind of subject, often runs into great
wildness and irregularity on a different kind.
No two arts are more analogous than poetry
and eloquence; but the poet aims chiefly at
pleasing, and the orator at moving. The
poet may have a very nice discernment of the
qualities which are fit to please, and may
conduct a poem with the utmost regularity;
and yet may be incapable of producing a re∣gular
oration: the qualities which tend to
move, are different in some respects from those
which please; to move, objects must be set
in a different light, and described in a diffe∣rent
manner, from what pure poetry would
require; to discern their tendency to move,
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
a sort of judgment different from the poeti∣cal,
is necessary; if the poet have not this
sort of judgment, he cannot succeed in elo∣quence,
the parts of his oration, though se∣parately
beautiful, will be often improper and
misplaced. Indeed a poet always runs a risk
of becoming florid, desultory and incorrect,
in an oration; he cannot escape it, except he
possess judgment of another kind, as well as
that which pure poetry would demand.</P>
<P>IN these several ways which have been
mentioned, in fitting men for applying their
ideas to different purposes, in leading imagi∣nation
into different tracks, and in bestowing
on it different kinds of regularity, judgment
is active in diversifying the forms of genius.
But it may likewise be observed, That, inde∣pendent
of this influence of judgment upon
genius, there will always be a considerable
analogy in the form of these two powers. In
all cases, some exertions of imagination are
intermixed with those of judgment. In ma∣thematical
reasonings, truths self-evident, or
already demonstrated, are seasonably suggested
by fancy; in experimental reasonings, parti∣cular
facts and conclusions from them, are in
like manner suggested; in experimental rea∣sonings
of different kinds, different sorts of
<PB N="316" REF="323"/>
facts and conclusions are brought into view;
in the fine arts, fancy is continually employed
in exhibiting to taste, those qualities concern∣ing
which it pronounces. In consequence of
this, every man has an advantage for excel∣ling
in that species of judgment, which is
most congruous to the turn of his imagina∣tion:
and on the other hand, his imagination
will take that turn which is most suitable to
the peculiarity of his judgment. Thus, by
the influence which these two powers mutu∣ally
exert on one another, each of them is so
moulded and altered, that their habitual form
and character becomes in a great measure the
same.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kinds of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have endeavoured to
investigate separately the sources from
which the diversities of genius spring. In
this investigation, it was necessary to search
out the varieties incident to those powers
which are any ways concerned in the opera∣tions
of genius; for these varieties are the
simple principles, by the combination of several
of which every distinct kind or form of genius
is constituted. We must now pursue a dif∣ferent
method. Every kind of genius de∣rives
its denomination most properly from the
nature of the object about which it is em∣ployed,
or of the end to which it is adapted.
The distinction, therefore, of the kinds of ge∣nius,
may be most commodiously deduced
from the difference of their objects and ends:
and distinguishing them according to these, we
must explain each, by combining the prin∣ciples
already established, and pursuing them
through their natural consequences.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Genius twofold; for Science, or for the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>THE ends to which Genius may be
adapted, are reducible to two; the
discovery of <HI>truth,</HI> and the production of
<HI>beauty.</HI> The former belongs to the <HI>sciences,</HI>
the latter to the <HI>arts.</HI> Genius is, then, the
power of invention, either in science or in the
arts, either of truth or of beauty.</P>
<P>THERE are great differences between one
science and another, and between one art and
another. On account of these differences,
each science and each art requires something
peculiar in the genius which is suited to it. I
intend not, at present, to descend to the investi∣gation
of these minuter peculiarities: it would
be curious; but it would be likewise intricate:
at any rate it is naturally posterior to the illus∣tration
of the more general distinctions of
genius.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise a general analogy among
all the sciences, and among all the arts: and
therefore we may expect to find some charac∣ters
common to scientific genius in all the
forms which it assumes, and other characters,
dissimilar to these, common to all the kinds of
<PB N="319" REF="326"/>
genius which are exerted in the arts. These
are the characters which I shall endeavour to
ascertain.</P>
<P>SOME difference between genius for science,
and genius for the arts, arises necessarily from
the very diversity of their ends. I begin with
this. Scientific genius addresses its discove∣ries
to the understanding; their end is infor∣mation:
genius for the arts addresses its pro∣ductions
to taste, and aims at pleasing by
them. It is a property of genius, that it keeps
the end of the work continually in view, and
by the view of it, modifies all the parts of the
work, and selects the means which it employs
so as they may be subservient to that end.
This contributes to distinguish these two kinds
of genius, and to render all their operations
and efforts very dissimilar: they consider all
their objects in perfectly different lights.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius leads a person to look
out only for such objects and ideas as imply
some truth, or suggest some new conclusion.
Assisted by the constant perception of this end,
any relation is sufficient for introducing such
objects and ideas; all the associating princi∣ples
are put upon the search for them; every
objects which these principles present, is sted∣dily
contemplated in that point of view in
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
which it contributes to this purpose; all the
circumstances of it which contribute to this
purpose, are studiously sought out and exa∣mined
with care; objects and circumstances
of objects, which contribute nothing to it, ei∣ther
are not at all suggested, or are instantly
perceived to be useless, and dismissed without
the smallest notice. Genius for the arts ren∣ders
the person who possesseth it, equally in∣tent
on pleasing taste by his work. In con∣sequence
of its impulse, objects and ideas fit
to gratify taste, are very readily suggested to
him; they are drawn into his view by their
relation to the design, as well as by the rela∣tions
which they bear to one another; as soon
as they are suggested, they are moulded into
that form, and placed in that attitude, in
which they promote this design, and they are
contemplated in that form and attitude alone:
such objects and such circumstances of objects
as are unfit to please, either do not at all occur
to the artist, or, being perceived at one glance
to be unfit, are immediately rejected.</P>
<P>BY this fixt association of so dissimilar ends,
the two kinds of genius become very unlike
in all their exertions. In every complex ob∣ject
that can engage our attention, there are
two sorts of qualities; there are some which
<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
give us pleasure or pain, and there are others
which convey perceptions of an indifferent
nature. Genius for the arts directs the at∣tention
chiefly to the former sort, and it leads
to consider them only so far as they either im∣mediately
produce, or remotely contribute to
pleasure or pain. Qualities which appear in∣different
to sense, gratify taste in some situ∣ations:
whenever they do, they attract the
notice and employ the powers of genius for
the arts. The mere perception of extension
is indifferent; but the largeness of its quan∣tity
produces grandeur, its terminations form
figures either beautiful or significant; a just
representation of it often displays skill: in all
these cases it is a source of pleasure, and en∣gages
the notice and employs the abilities of
the poet and the painter. Both those quali∣ties
of things which give pleasure or pain,
and those which give neither, enter into the
sciences and affect the genius adapted to them.
But the former are generally considered ab∣stractedly
from the pleasure or pain which
they give; and even when these are taken into
the account, the philosopher proceeds as if he
were insensible to them, makes them the sub∣ject
of cool enquiry, examines what truth
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
they indicate, analyzes the feelings, or traces
the causes and effects of them.</P>
<P>THE philosopher describes minutely all the
appearances of his object: his design requies
it; every one of them involves some truth;
inattention to any one of them may prevent
the discovery of truth, or occasion error; those
of them which seem least striking, often lead
most directly to truth, or lead to the most im∣portant
truths. A poet, on the contrary,
would overlook by far the greatest part of
these appearances; they are unfit to please,
and for that reason attract no share of his at∣tention:
he fixes on a few that are most strik∣ing,
and labours to set these in a striking light.
The observation of many minute circum∣stances,
and a variety of exact mensurations,
were absolutely necessary for ascertaining the
laws of light and colours; and Newton's ge∣nius
gave him a propensity to attend to them:
these would make no figure in poetry; and a
poet, though perfectly acquainted with them,
would never once think of them while engaged
in composition; he would catch some general
appearances, and be satisfied with these.</P>
<P>A GENIUS for science is formed by <HI>pene∣tration,</HI>
a genius for the arts, by <HI>brightness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330"/>
There are, perhaps, no general characters by
which these two kinds of genius can be more
properly discriminated. Each of these cha∣racters
is produced by certain peculiar quali∣ties
of those powers on which genius has a
dependence. In the one of them are combined
modifications of imagination, memory, and
judgment, different from those modifications
of the same powers, which are combined in
the other: these powers likewise are combined
in different proportions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Structure of Imagination, which distin∣guishes
the two kinds of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH penetration and brightness imply
a great extent and compass of imagi∣nation,
or great vigour of the associating prin∣ciples;
but they imply different sorts of com∣pass
and vigour. Penetration implies such a
force of imagination as leads to the compre∣hension
and explication of a subject: bright∣ness
of imagination fits a man for adorning
a subject. A penetrating mind emits the rays
by which truth is discovered: a bright fancy
supplies the colours by which beauty is pro∣duced.
There are many peculiarities of ima∣gination,
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
which contribute to the formation
of these opposite characters: by tracing out
these, our general description of the distinc∣tion
between genius for science and genius
for the arts, will be justified, and a more par∣ticular
view will be obtained of the difference
of these two kinds.</P>
<P>ACUTENESS of judgment is essential to pe∣netration,
but cannot alone produce it. It
would produce correctness and readiness in
deciding upon materials which were in our
view: but penetration implies, over and above
this, a capacity of bringing quickly and com∣pletely
into view, whatever materials are ne∣cessary
for our present purpose. This capa∣city
can arise only from <HI>imagination.</HI> In ge∣neral,
penetration requires that construction
of imagination, which fits a man for fixing
his view steddily on one thing, or on those
connected with it by close and important re∣lations,
for attending to all the circumstances
belonging to that thing, and, as it were, ex∣hausting
its qualities. This construction of
imagination is evidently adapted to the end
of science, the investigation of truth. For
the conclusions of science lie deep, and must
escape the transient glance of the superficial
observer: they occur by our attending to such
<PB N="325" REF="332"/>
qualities in things as are least striking and
least apt to force themselves on our attention,
and by our pondering and contemplating in a
variety of lights, such qualities as cannot be
perfectly comprehended by a person who dwells
not on the same object for any length of time.
—Brightness of imagination is of an opposite
nature: it is such a strength of imagination
as makes every present object suggest a mul∣titude
of ideas, and hurries the mind quickly
from one thing, to others not very strictly
connected with it. This character is no less
evidently accommodated to the purpose of the
arts, than penetration to that of the sciences.
A quick succession, or a copious exhibition of
different objects fit to please, is a great mean
of producing the beauty sought after in all the
arts. In poetry, for instance, the intricacy of
the fable, that is, the variety and dissimilarity
of the incidents, and the diversity, the num∣ber,
and a proper remoteness of the images,
are reckoned among the surest tests of real
genius.</P>
<P>IT would appear to be one consequence of
what has been said, that penetration implies
an aptness to be affected only by the closest and
strongest relations of things; and that bright∣ness
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
implies a propensity to be influenced by
such relations as are slighter and more re∣mote:
for the latter propensity tends to draw
off the mind to a great distance from its ob∣ject;
but the former allows it to continue
nearer to it, and makes it easier to recur quickly
to the contemplation of it. The consequence
is just; and the consideration of it will farther
determine our idea of the difference between
a genius for science and a genius for the arts.
When ideas are suggested to men of these dif∣ferent
kinds of genius, by means of the same
relation, it will be found that, generally, the
ideas connected with the present object by the
stronger degree of that relation, are suggested
to the philosopher, and those connected by the
weaker degree of it, to the artist. The former
sort are those about which the deductions of
science are commonly employed; the latter
supply the decorations necessary in the fine
arts. Any comparison by which a philosopher
would illustrate or confirm a theory, must be
such as is exactly parallel; it is enough for a
poetical comparison, and even heightens its
beauty, that it agree with the subject to which
it is applied, only in some of its circumstances.
When a philosopher explains the causes of
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
any appearance, or traces out the effects of
any principle, he proceeds regularly through
them all, according to the different degrees of
their dependence: let a poet introduce the
same subject; he will describe, not all the
causes or effects, but some of them; he will
often omit the nearest and most direct, and
take notice only of such as are more distant
and indirect; he will not give a full delinea∣tion
of any one cause or effect, but mark each
by some leading or striking circumstances.
These differences in manner are natural con∣sequences
of the difference in the principles
of association, now under consideration; and
that they take place, might be shown by an
induction of many particulars. The subject
of Lucretius's poem is scientifical; several of
the Epicurean theories which he describes poe∣tically,
are philosophically deduced in the
writings of the ancients: compare his account
of any part of the Epicurean system, with the
account of the same part in Cicero's philoso∣phical
works, for instance, and the differences
just now remarked will appear. If in any
instances they do not appear, it will be found
either that the former is not there properly
poetical, or that the latter has dressed up phi∣losophy
in a rhetorical garb approaching near
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
to the poetical<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>All these cases may be exemplified in different passages of these two writers. They both give an account, for in∣stance, of Epicurus's doctrine concerning the motion of atoms. Lucretius's account of their moving downward, is given in a manner considerably poetical, and in which we may remark many of the peculiarities just now mentioned, as characteris∣tical of genius for the arts:

Cicero gives an account of the same doctrine, in a manner very unlike, in the simple cool manner suitable to science: “Censet enim, eadem illa individua, et solida corpora ferre suo deorsum pondere ad lineam: hunc naturalem esse omnium corporum motum.” <HI>De Fin.</HI> lib. i. and in several other places. The poet's account of the declination of the atoms, has little poetical in it;
<Q><L>Illud in his quoque te rebus cognoscere avemus:</L>
<L>Corpora cum deorsum rectum per inane feruntur</L>

and in consequence of this, it differs very little from Cicero's account of the same tenet; “Deinde ibidem homo acutus, cum illud occurreret, si omnia deorsum e regione ferrentur, et, ut dixi, ad lineam, numquam fore, ut atomus altera alte∣ram posset attingere: itaque—declinare dixit atomum perpaullum:—ita e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fici complexiones, et copulationes, et adhaesiones atomorum inter se: ex quo efficeretur mundus, omnesque partes mundi, quaeque in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssent.” <HI>Ibid.</HI> Many other examples might be produced.</P></NOTE>.

<P><PB N="329" REF="336"/>
BUT a propensity to be affected with the
closer or the slighter degrees of relation, is not
alone sufficient to account for the difference
between brightness and penetration, or to ex∣plain
how one genius is fit for science, and ano∣ther
for the arts. It must be observed farther,
that the peculiar predominance of some of the
associating principles contributes to form pe∣netration,
and the predominance of others of
them, to form brightness of imagination; and
that in several ways.</P>
<P>THERE are some of the relations of things
which lead the mind more quickly, and to a
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
greater distance, from these things, than other
relations would lead it: the former will by
this very circumstance, according to what has
been already evinced, be most favourable to
brightness, the latter to penetration. There
are some qualities in every object, which lay
a foundation for relations between it and
many other objects: thus the obvious sensible
qualities of bodies produce an infinity of re∣semblances
or contrasts to a multitude of other
things. A strong propensity to attend to these
qualities, and to be affected by the relations
correspondent to them, will be highly condu∣cive
to brightness of fancy; it will produce
surprising assemblages, agreeable imagery, and
unexpected ornaments. But it is unfavour∣able
to penetration; it produces associations
which must lead the mind through many ob∣jects
in a rapid succession, allowing it to take
but a superficial view of each. It will there∣fore
contribute to penetration, at least it will
remove one obstruction to the exercise of this
power, that the imagination be not readily or
strongly affected by those slighter relations
which the most obvious qualities form among
a great multitude of things unconnected in
other respects. Accordingly, I do not say all,
but most philosophers who were really in∣ventors,
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
have shown no great turn for adorn∣ing
their writings with such images and com∣parisons
as form the graces of poetry. There
are in all objects, qualities likewise of an op∣posite
kind, which do not form obvious con∣nexions
between them and a multitude of
other objects. Such are the mutual influence
of the qualities of the same thing, the various
phenomena of these qualities, their causes and
their consequences. These, instead of impel∣ling
the mind to wander through a wide ex∣tent
of things, rather confine it to one thing,
or to such as are intimately connected with it
in some important respect. A prevailing pro∣pensity,
therefore, to attend chiefly to such
qualities, will not hurry the mind with rapi∣dity
from one thing to others; and will there∣fore
be unfavourable to brightness: but it will
leave it at leisure to dwell on its present ob∣ject,
and dispose it, that it may find employ∣ment,
to contemplate it in every light; and
will thus be conducive to penetration.</P>
<P>IT is observable likewise, that the qualities
last mentioned form the most important and
interesting relations among things; these will,
therefore, influence the imagination and pro∣mote
penetration, in much the same manner
with the stronger degrees of any one relation:
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
the relations which are formed by the others,
are much more trivial, and will affect the
fancy and produce brightness, in the same
manner with the slighter degrees of any rela∣tion.</P>
<P>THE more important relations of things,
will also be those which lead most naturally
to the discovery of truths concerning them;
the more trivial relations are, on the other
hand, naturally adapted to amusement and
pleasure, which is the object of the arts.
This difference suggests an observation of con∣siderable
consequence for explaining the dis∣tinction
between the two kinds of genius now
under consideration. We shall find on exa∣mination,
that those relations which have
been already mentioned, as conducive to pe∣netration
by the predominance of their in∣fluence
on the imagination, are the relations
chiefly concerned in the discovery of truth.
These relations are all reducible to the dif∣ferent
modes of causation and co-existence;
and some or other of the modes of these, are
the immediate subjects of most of the conclu∣sions
in the several sciences. In the science
both of bodies and of the mind, the enquiry
is principally about the causes of phenomena,
their concomitants, the effects proceeding
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
from causes, and the consequences of general
laws. Many propositions in mathematics
regard the properties which are co-existent in
figures and numbers, or which necessarily re∣sult
from their nature. Even when other
relations are the immediate objects of scien∣tifical
conclusions, yet it is chiefly by means
of causation and co-existence that they are
inferred. In mathematics, the proportions of
quantities and numbers are deduced as neces∣sary
consequences from principles formerly
known. In hydrostatics, the specific gravi∣ties
of bodies, which are properly degrees of
a common quality, are deduced from certain
effects of the weight of bodies. This being
the case, the predominance of these relations,
causation and co-existence, as principles of
association in the fancy, cannot fail to pro∣duce
penetration, and to fit genius peculiarly
for the subjects of science. It directs the
mind into the very track where truth lies; it
furnishes it with the very instruments by
which truth may be discovered.—It is no less
true, that those which have been mentioned
as the more trivial relations, and by their
prevalence conducive to brightness, or some
of them at least, are most adapted to the ob∣ject
and the end of the arts. The fine arts
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
are commonly called imitative: were they all
purely and totally such, there could be no
difficulty in pronouncing that resemblance is
the relation which would lead fancy to con∣trive
works of art. In painting, for instance,
which is strictly imitative, the figures, the
attitudes, the expression, the colouring, are
but so many means of rendering the picture a
just and striking representation of the standard,
whether actual or ideal, which the artist had
in view; and the conception of this standard
suggests them all to the fancy by the associat∣ing
principle of resemblance. But even in
cases where the arts are least imitative, it will
appear on attention that this principle is pre∣dominant
A discovery in science is some∣times
described poetically: such a description
will, perhaps more clearly and strikingly than
any other instance, show how much poetry is
employed about resemblances, and conse∣quently
how essential it is to poetic genius,
that this be the predominant principle of asso∣ciation.
Thomson thus describes Newton's
optical discoveries;
<Q><L>Even light itself, which every thing displays,</L>
<L>Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind</L>

<P><HI>All that is poetical in the description, is pro∣duced
by the metaphors and comparisons,
(evidently suggested by the principle of re∣semblance)
which are here introduced, and
implied in such expressions as these,</HI> untwisted

of parent-colours—the flaming red—the tawny

droops with frost—dy'd in the fainting violet
away<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The same observation is applicable to his description of the Rain-bow, immediately subjoined, ver. 112—115.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHATEVER relation is the predominant
principle of association in a particular person,
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
that person is always disposed to fix his atten∣tion
chiefly on those qualities in objects which
lay a foundation for that relation; and he is
disposed to consider every quality in the light
in which it is fittest for suggesting ideas by
means of that relation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See above, Part II. sect. 7.</NOTE>. This disposition
is, perhaps, one cause of the predominance
of a particular associating principle: it cer∣tainly
adds to the force of the predominant
principle, and assists it in forming a correspon∣dent
turn of genius. The man, for instance,
whose imagination is under the influence of
causation and co-existence, not only strongly
feels the force of these relations when they
are perceived, but is also prone to perceive
them, prone to consider every object before
him, in that attitude in which it can most
readily suggest its causes, its effects, its con∣comitants,
and the like. This will contri∣bute
very much to render his genius pene∣trating;
both to direct it to the investigations
which belong to science, and to fit it to enter
deeply into them. He is continually busy in
turning every object that comes in his way,
to some use in the discovery of truth. He
has the same advantage for invention, that
the merchant who is intent on every oppor∣tunity
<PB N="337" REF="344"/>
of gain, has for enriching himself.
Just so, if resemblance be the predominant
principle of association, the mind, continually
in search of resemblances, will eagerly set
every object in such a point of view that it
may suggest them; and consequently it will
be successful in finding them out, and exhi∣biting
them, as well as strongly affected by
them when they are found. The colours of
light refracted by the prism, have been ob∣served
by the poet, as well as by the philoso∣pher
but they are considered by these in dif∣ferent
points of view, lead them into very
different trains of thinking, and are applied
to very different purposes. Pope applies them
as an image for illustrating a resembling sub∣ject,
and is led away quickly from the contem∣plation
of them to that subject;
<Q><L>False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,</L>
<L>Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place;</L>
<L>The face of Nature we no more survey,</L>
<L>All glares alike, without distinction gay:</L>
<L>But true expression, like th' unchanging sun,</L>
<L>Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon,</L>
<L>It gilds all objects, but it alters none<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Essay on Criticism, ver. 311—318.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The observation of them gave Newton's mind
a very different impulse: his attention was
<PB N="338" REF="345"/>
fixt upon these colours themselves; he consi∣dered
them as an effect which requires a suit∣able
cause, and was led to contrive a curious
set of experiments for ascertaining that cause.
Some of these experiments exhibit phenome∣na
which the poet might describe for their
own sakes, or the painter find an occasion to
represent on canvass: but Newton attended
only to those circumstances which indicated
some of the laws of light and colours; and
how strongly he was impelled to attend to
these, any person may judge by recollecting
what a prodigious number of appearances and
circumstances, minute in themselves, and,
abstracted from the investigation in which he
was engaged, unimportant and uninteresting,
he took notice of, and delineated with scru∣pulous
exactness, in his several experiments.</P>
<P>INDEED, as we observed formerly<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Part II. sect. 7.</NOTE>, no
one principle of association is sufficient for
invention on any subject, alone, or without
the assistance of other principles, acting in
subordination to it. On this account, the
predominance of resemblance, or of causation
and co-existence, appropriates genius to the
arts or to the sciences, not merely by the ex∣ertion
of these principles themselves, but also
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
by determining other associating principles to
act in subservience to them. There are two
ways in which one associating principle may
make others act in subservience to it.</P>
<P>FIRST, It may determine them to suggest
chiefly such ideas as are suitable to it, and ap∣plicable
to its purposes. Very various ideas
are connected with any present object by the
same relation; all these are in themselves
equally fit to be suggested by that object: but
if some of them correspond to the predomi∣nant
principle of association, or to the design
which it leads a person to propose and to keep
in view, these will be introduced in prefer∣ence
to others which have no such correspon∣dence.
A double relation belongs to them,
and draws them into view by a double power.
The subordinate principles exert themselves
by their own force; but the predominant one
gives their exertions a particular direction;
it likewise makes them, in that direction, act
with greater vigour than they would in any
other; it, as it were, infuses its own spirit into
them. In genius for the arts, resemblance,
the predominant principle of association,
continually operates along with all the other
principles, and, by uniting its force to theirs,
causes them suggest only, and suggest quickly,
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
such ideas as are conducive to the imitation or
representation which the artist has in view.
The attributes, qualities, and circumstances
of any subject, are connected with it by co-existence,
and are naturally suggested to the
imagination by this relation: the predomi∣nance
of resemblance as an associating prin∣ciple
in the poet or the painter, will make
these to be suggested, whenever they are ne∣cessary
for marking distinctly the object which
he describes or represents; and it will make
those of them to occur most readily which are
properest for this purpose, even though they
be in themselves remote. Nealces painting a
naval engagement between the Egyptians and
the Persians, and wanting to intimate that it
had happened on the Nile, the waters of
which are of the same colour with the sea,
contrived to accomplish his aim, by drawing
an ass drinking on the banks, and a crocodile
endeavouring to surprize him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Siquidem cum praelium navale Aegyptiorum et Persarum pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xisset▪ quod in Nilo, cujus aqua est mari similis, factum volebat intelligi; argumentoque declaravit, quod arte non poterat: asellum enim in li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tore bibentem pinxit, et crocodi∣lum insidiantem ci. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Htst.</HI> lib. xxxy. cap. 10.</NOTE>. In every
good picture, in every good poetical descrip∣tion,
we perceive the influence of co-existence
operating on the imagination, under the di∣rection.
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
of resemblance: whenever it does not
operate, precision is wanting, nothing is ap∣propriated,
every thing is common and inde∣terminate;
whenever it is not directed by
resemblance, there are superfluous, useless, or
ill-adapted circumstances. A defect in the
former respect, produces poverty of genius;
a defect in the latter respect, irregularity.
Both defects are observable in some works
even of the most ingenious artists, and are
acknowledged to take something from their
merit, and to indicate a failure in the exer∣tion
of genius. It has often been remarked
as a blemish in Pope's Windsor Forest, and it
has sometimes been urged as a proof of his
not having much genius for descriptive poe∣try,
that he describes rural beauty in general,
rather than the peculiarities of that place;
the apology made for him by his advocates▪
that the place had at that time few peculiar
beauties, supposes the justness of the prin∣ciple
on which the remark proceeds, and, if
it be allowed, will imply that the subject was
ill-chosen for a display of poetic genius; and
will thus confirm the observation which we
have made. Cowley's poem <HI>On the Queen's
repairing Somerset-house</HI> is rather a minute
delineation of its situation and the objects
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
surrounding it, than a poetical description by
a proper selection of its beauties. Every epi∣thet
which is as applicable to almost any other
subject as to that to which it is applied, every
description which is vague and not charac∣teristical
of its original, every character that
is not distinctly marked, is an instance of
the former defect in genius. Every circum∣stance
in a description which counteracts the
effect of the whole, or even which contributes
nothing to it, every incident not sufficiently
connected with the main subject, is an instance
of the latter. Either of these defects, if it
be great and permanent, is acknowledged to
be inconsistent with any considerable degree of
real genius.—What has been said concerning
co-existence, may be easily applied to all the
other relations. For instance, no perform∣ance
in any of the arts, can be carried on
without the introduction of causes and of
effects; it is often by means of these that the
subjects are marked, and a distinct resemblance
or representation of them produced. The
principle of resemblance, keeping the artist
intent on the production of this, will render
causation active in suggesting ideas conducive
to it; we shall perceive in his work many
illustrations of things by their causes or their
<PB N="343" REF="350"/>
consequences, which show that the associating
principle of causation has been very active;
and we shall perceive the fitness of them all
for giving a precise and lively conception of
the object, which shows that its activity was
influenced and directed by resemblance. In
consequence of both these circumstances, the
piece is both rich and correct. In the greatest
part of poetical descriptions, one principal
means of conveying a striking description,
is the suggestion of causes or effects: in the
very first description in Thomson's Spring,
it is almost the only means employed;
<Q><L>And see where surly Winter passes off</L>
<L>Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts:</L>
<L>His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill,</L>
<L>The shattered forest, and the ravag'd vale;</L>
<L>While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch,</L>
<L>Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost,</L>
<L>The mountains lift their green heads to the sky<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11—17.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In like manner, the predominance of resem∣blance
makes contrariety to suggest, not any
ideas which happen to bear that relation to
the present object, but such as form contrasts
and oppositions fit to render the conception
of it clearer and more striking. All the con∣trasts
which are approved, in painting, in
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
music, or in poetry, are such as contribute to
this purpose. As it is thus essential to genius
for the arts, that all the associating principles
act in subordination to resemblance, so their
acting in this subordination, with vigour and
quickness, must contribute greatly to bright∣ness
and richness of imagination: they are
like a multitude of servants, busied in provid∣ing
abundance of all things for their prince.
The degree of perfection in genius, will al∣ways
be proportioned to the vigour of all the
associating principles, and the strictness of
their subjection to the leading one.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been said, it will be easy
to explain, how causation and co-existence,
the one or the other of which is always the
predominant principle of association in scien∣tific
genius, determine all the other principles
to introduce such ideas as lead to the discovery
of truth, and, by imparting vigour to them
while they act in this direction, enable them
to introduce such ideas readily and in abun∣dance.
It will be sufficient to illustrate this,
with respect to one principle of association.
In every sort of scientific genius, resemblance
must have considerable influence on the ima∣gination;
in mathematics, similitude of ratios
is often a means of invention; in philosophy,
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
one experiment suggests others which have a
likeness to it, and one conclusion leads to ano∣ther
analogous conclusion. The present ob∣ject
might suggest many others, by means of
their resemblance to it, which would contri∣ribute
nothing to a new discovery: it is when
the predominant principle of association, act∣ing
powerfully on a person, fixes his atten∣tion
on the reference of the present object to
the discovery of a particular truth, and, in
consequence of this, makes it suggest only
such, from among the similar objects, as have
the same reference, that the principle of re∣semblance
promotes penetration, and contri∣butes
to the fertility of scientific genius. Ex∣periments
in electricity have gradually and
successively suggested a great multitude of
other experiments on the same subject; all
these experiments have been frequently re∣peated
by many persons; the several circum∣stances
of them have been accurately observed
and recorded; and they have been surpris∣ingly
varied: but very many of them serve
only to diversify the appearances, to astonish
or amuse, but lead not to any discovery con∣cerning
the nature, the cause, or the laws of
electricity. Some of those who have made
the most experiments, deduced no general
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
conclusions from them, or were inaccurate
and erroneous in those which they attempted
to deduce: they possessed, in a considerable
degree of strength, the associating principle
of resemblance, and those other associating
principles which were necessary for leading
them from one experiment to another, and
for enabling them to contrive and conduct
experiments, but they were defective in those
principles of association which must be predo∣minant
in order to form a genius for scienti∣fical
deductions, and without acting in sub∣ordination
to which, these former cannot pro∣mote
this purpose. Others have deduced
some general conclusions from some of their
experiments, but have likewise made many
experiments which tend to no such conclu∣sions:
in them the principles of association
which must take the lead in forming scien∣tific
genius, have had some degree of force,
yet not force enough to render them uni∣formly
and habitually predominant; and in
consequence of this the other assciating prin∣ciples
have acted in subordination to them,
only in some instances, not constantly or in
all their experiments. There is no electrician
who has displayed a greater share of real sci∣entific
genius, than Franklin. His experi∣ments
<PB N="347" REF="354"/>
are not so numerous as those of many
others: this proceeds not from an inferiority
to any, in the species of ingenuity requisite
for contriving and conducting experiments;
on the contrary in all his experiments there is
a peculiar neatness, beauty, and variety; but
it proceeds from his possessing the associating
principle of causation in very great vigour,
so that it constantly exerts itself, and makes
all the other associating principles act in per∣fect
subservience to it. Accordingly there is
scarce one of his experiments superfluous,
unmeaning, or indefinite; they all contribute
to establish general conclusions, they are un∣dertaken
with this view, and they are con∣ducted
in the manner fittest for accomplishing
it. His experiments for instance on the
Leyden phial, are a regularly connected series
sit for establishing the difference between po∣sitive
and negative electricity, for ascertaining
the several circumstances of that difference,
for tracing out its several consequences, and
for setting them in such lights as may render
them most subservient both to the contrivance
of new experiments and to the deduction of
new conclusions. The effect of pointed
bodies in drawing off the electrical fire, is
discovered by a set of experiments well con∣trived
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
for the purpose; and is immediately
applied to new experiments proper for inves∣tigating
the exact similarity of electricity to
thunder and lightning, experiments con∣ducted
with a steady view to the establishment
of this doctrine, and with the corrected sub∣servience
to it: and that similarity is applied
to important practical purposes, with a readi∣ness
and address which shows a mind intent
on investigating effects and consequences, ac∣tuated
by that associating principle which in∣stigates
to the investigation of them, putting
in motion all the other principles which lead
to the means of prosecuting that investigation,
and making them operate with vigour in the
use of these means<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Facts amply sufficient for supporting all the observations made in this illustration, will be found in PRIESTLY'S <HI>History of Electricity,</HI> Part 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, As each of the associating prin∣ciples
is susceptible of various modifications<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See Part II. sect. 6.</NOTE>,
the predominant principle may make the rest
act in subordination to itself, by disposing us
to be affected by those modifications of them,
which are most coincident with it, and fittest
for promoting its designs. This seems to be
one of the chief ways in which the predomi∣nant
principle determines any other principle
<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
to suggest some ideas in preference to others;
and therefore the taking notice of it, serves
to explain farther the observations made un∣der
the last head. When we consider how
many and how dissimilar modifications every
associating principle admits, we must, be sen∣sible
that the power of the predominant prin∣ciple
to modify the others suitably to its own
designs, will introduce great variety into their
effects, and give birth to very different kinds
of genius. Resemblance, for instance, which
is the leading instrument of invention in the
arts, is often a subordinate instrument of in∣vention
in science. But resemblance is of
very different kinds. The resemblances which
influence the poet or the painter, are for the
most part such as belong to the sensible qua∣lities
or the general appearances of things,
such as are striking, and such as the artist can
make to be easily and strongly conceived by
others. Such resemblances are of little con∣sequence
in the investigations of science, and
have little influence on the imagination of
the philosopher. It is his aim to discover
causes, laws, or effects: intent on this, he
observes, and is affected by, such similitudes
as regard the manner of conducting experi∣ments,
such as are indications of things pro∣ceeding
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
from the same causes with the present
object, or from similar causes, of their being
produced in the same manner, of their having
similar consequences, or of their bearing
similar relations to any object, and the like.
Such sorts of resemblance are congruous to
the predominant principle of causation; they
are subservient to its operations; they are the
sorts which make one proportion, one expe∣riment,
or one conclusion suggest others:
and that principle causes these, rather than
other sorts of resemblance, to act vigorously
and pour in ideas upon the mind. One can
conceive many objects which the appearances
of light refracted by the prisin, would have
naturally suggested to a poet; but they would
have all been such as bear some resemblance
or analogy to these appearances themselves.
The prismatic experiments suggested to New∣ton
other experiments or observations on
bubbles and plates of air, of glass, and of
water, on speculums, on heated steel, melted
metals, coloured powders, salts, vitriols, al∣lum,
borax, nitre, comphire, diamonds, and
a great variety of other substances. None of
them would have come within the range of
poetical genius; some of them are too ex∣actly
similar to serve for images or compa∣risons,
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
others are too remote to be applicable,
in their obvious appearance, to the purpose
of illustration, others have nothing fit to strike
the fancy, or to promote the poet's views:
but they were the very trials applicable to
Newton's design; and his predominant prin∣ciple
of association, keeping that design fix∣edly
in his view, excited and gave vigour to
the sorts of resemblance which could suggest
objects subservient to it. In like manner, the
relation of cause and effect, which is a lead∣ing
principle of association to the philosopher,
is very often employed by the artist as a sub∣ordinate
principle; and, by being in him
subordinate, it is modified in particular ways:
he is influenced, not by every species of it,
but by those species which can enliven or de∣fine
the representation of an object. The
philosopher is affected, for instance, by the
closer and more proper kinds of causation;
these alone are of use in his designs: the poet
is most frequently affected by the less proper
kinds, and the remoter degrees of this rela∣tion;
these are generally the fittest for enter∣ing
into striking descriptions. This will also
hold true of co-existence; it is of little use to
the philosopher, and is little employed by
him, except in its strictest forms; it is used
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
by the artist in all its forms, chiefly in such
as are more loose. Contrariety is employed
both in science and in the arts, as a subordi∣nate
principle of association; but different
kinds of it operate in these two subjects, ac∣cording
to their congruity to the predomi∣nant
principle in each, and their subservience
to the respective ends of each. The philoso∣pher
is influenced chiefly by contrarieties in
the causes and the effects of things; a genius
for the arts, though not insensible to these,
is also, and perhaps more, affected by oppo∣sitions
and contrasts in the appearances of
things themselves.</P>
<P>THUS in every kind of genius, the prin∣ciple
of association which is in that kind pre∣dominant
keeps the end in view, renders the
mind intent upon it, gives it a disposition to
run into what can promote it, and to reject
what is unserviceable for it: by means of all
this, that predominant principle gives all the
other principles a propensity to suggest such
ideas, and to assume such forms as are most
coincident with it, and most subservient to
the end of the work. In every kind of ge∣nius,
all the associating principles must ope∣rate
vigorously: but the predominant prin∣ciple
operates by its own inherent vigour,
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
like the sun which shines with his own light;
and the subordinate principles may be com∣pared
to the moon, which shines with bor∣rowed
light, and reflects it only on that side
which is turned to the sun; they have their
vigour imparted to them by the predominant
principle, and they act in a direction suitable
to it. It will confirm the justness of this
distinction, and farther illustrate our subject,
to observe, That the consant operation of
the predominant principle along with the
subordinate ones, is always clearly perceiv∣able,
not only in the subservience which it
gives these to its designs, but also in the se∣parate
effects which it produces. Let one
experiment, for instance, suggest a similar
one to a philosopher, he not only applies it
to the investigation in which he was profess∣edly
engaged; but, if it suggest any other
conclusions by means of any of its circum∣stances,
he readily takes notice of them also,
and thus shows how much and how uninter∣ruptedly
the relation of cause and effect influ∣ences
his imagination. Innumerable instances
of the imagination being in this manner in∣fluenced,
might be collected from the works
of philosophers. To hint but at a very few;
Newton rested not in applying his optical
<PB N="354" REF="361"/>
experiments to the discovery of the proper∣ties
of light and colours, which was his im∣mediate
view in making them, but considered
also how they might be applied to the expli∣cation
of animal motion, attraction, and other
phenomena<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Optics, <HI>Qu.</HI> 24. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Wheeler having found by
experiments, that bodies to which electricity
is communicated, repel one another, was led
by the circumstances of these experiments, to
observe, that it suggests a reason for a very
different phenomenon, for the dissolution of
bodies in menstrua, viz. that the particles of
the solvend, having imbibed particles of the
menstruum, so as to be saturated with them,
the saturated particles become repulsive of
one another, separate and fly to pieces<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hist. of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. 4.</NOTE>.
Desaguliers was led in like manner to think
of transferring the result of his electrical ex∣periments,
to account for the fixing of air by
steams of sulphur, and for the ascent of va∣pours<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>per.</HI> 6.</NOTE>.
And later electricians have thought
of applying their experiments and conclu∣sions
to account, not only for thunder, light∣ning,
and meteors, but also for water-spouts,
hurricanes, and earthquakes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> per. 10. sect. 12.</NOTE>. A poet
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
sometimes introduces a series of causes and
effects; but he always describes them in a
manner different from the philosopher: how
much his imagination is under the power of
resemblance, appears from his illustrating
every part of the description by epithets,
images, metaphors, and comparisons. The
passage already quoted from Thomson, con∣cerning
the prismatic image, may serve as an
illustration of this. Many other examples
might be produced<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>Many passages in Lucretius, of which the subject is purely scientifical, are in this manner rendered beautifully poetical. Whenever Virgil introduces a subject of science, the prevalence of a poetic genius is conspicuous through the whole of it. The two following passages are instances of this.

ONE remarkable difference between the
two kinds of genius, remains yet to be men∣tioned.
In scientifical investigations, the
imagination can receive no assistance from the
passions: few passions can mix with these in∣vestigations;
and if these few were allowed
to interfere, they would infect our conclu∣sions,
and obstruct our discoveries. Where
truth is the object, the passions can produce
only prejudices fit to lead away from it. But
genius for the arts can never exist where the
passions have not great power over the imagi∣nation,
in affecting the train and association
of perceptions. An imagination easily af∣fected
by the passions, is peculiar to genius
for the arts; and it is essential to it in all the
forms which it can assume. There is scarce
any of the fine arts which is not susceptible
of the pathetic, and in which the pathetic is
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
not a capital excellence. In painting, in
music, in poetry, in eloquence, it is often
necessary to express the passions and affections
of the soul: they can be expressed only by
the person whose sensibility of heart enables
him to conceive the passion with vivacity, to
catch it as by infection, and whose imagina∣tion
immediately receives an impulse from it,
and pours in the ideas of the proper charac∣ters
of the several passions, of those effects,
imitable in the particular art, by which each
passion naturally shows itself. Every artist
must often excite the passions: they are ex∣cited
chiefly by being well expressed: they
are excited also by strong representations of
their objects and their causes; but it is the
fancy, excited by the lively conception of the
passion, running into the same thoughts
which the passion, if really working, would
suggest, and placing the artist in the situation
in which he would then be, that puts it in
his power to imagine, and consequently to
represent, its causes and its objects in a way
proper for infusing it into others<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Summa enim (quantum ego quidem sentio) circa mo∣vendos affectus in ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> posita est, ut moveamur ipsi.—Nec incendit nisi ignis, nec madescimus nisi humore: nec res ulla dat alteri colorem, quem ipsa non habet.

<P><PB N="358" REF="365"/>
IN these several ways, brightness and pene∣tration,
a genius for the arts and a genius for
the sciences, arise from a difference in the
turn and construction of the imagination.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the two Kinds of Genius differ in respect
of the Assistance which they derive from
Memory</HEAD>
<P>BOTH in genius for the arts, and in ge∣nius
for science, imagination is assisted
by memory, operating in subordination to it,
and operating continually along with it. But
it is not, in these two kinds, assisted equally
by memory, nor assisted by the same species
of memory.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="366"/>
IN scientifical invention, memory is exerted
in a much greater degree, and its assistance is
more indispensably necessary than in the arts.
All the experiments, all the observations, all
the principles, employed in philosophical in∣vestigations,
must be such as have been actu∣ally
observed or ascertained, and are exactly
remembered, else they can be of no use for
establishing a just theory. Memory must at∣test
the phenomena as really observed, and the
principles as already verified, and produce a
full conviction of their having been observed
and verified, else the philosopher would never
think of applying them to the support of his
theory. Phenomena not experienced, but ima∣gined,
could lead to none but chimerical con∣clusions.
At one time electricians imagined
that they saw in their experiments the power
of electricity affected by the colours of bodies,
and light bodies performing a regular motion
from west to cast round an electrified ball<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>History of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. v.</NOTE>:
had these facts been taken for granted, and
conclusions deduced from them, the conclu∣sions
must have been altogether fanciful.
Often indeed men can in some degree imagine
beforehand what will be the result of an ex∣periment,
or what the appearances which it
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
will disclose; may, cannot restrain themselves
from conjectures concerning this. But it is
only intimate acquaintance with the subject,
extensive knowlege of the laws of nature, ac∣curate
remembrance of the appearances which
have attended analogous experiments, discern∣ment
of the variation of circumstances in the
experiment proposed, and judgment of the
probable consequences of that variation, that
can enable them to conjecture right. Some
of Bacon's anticipations, and many of New∣ton's
conjectures in his queries, were just, and
have been since established by actual trials.
But if, without these requisites, by the mere
force of imagination, a person venture to guess
in this manner, he will almost certainly guess
wrong; and, if he proceed to reason from it,
will produce a fantastical hypothesis. Scarce
any man can possess the requisites mentioned,
in so great a degree, as to render it safe for
him to build upon the supposed result, with∣out
first bringing it to actual trial, and making
himself certain of the fact. Even when a
man may naturally think that he has the best
foundation for his conjecture, the result may,
on trial, turn out not only different, but di∣rectly
opposite. When all the experiments
at that time made seemed to show, that the
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
electrical fire is contained in the glass itself,
and when it was known that the earth or a
floor draws off this fire from a globe or tube
in which it has been excited, it was natural
to conjecture that the electrical power would
be strengthened by preventing its being thus
drawn off, by supporting the machine and the
operator on some substance which is not a con∣ductor
of electricity; the conjecture was
formed by several electricians, and was in the
highest degree plausible: but when they made
the trial, the very reverse of their expectation
happened, the power was very much weak∣ened;
and this unlooked for effect led some
of them to correct the specious error which
had occasioned their conjecture, to conclude
that the electric fire is only collected, not pro∣duced,
in the glass by friction, and to discover
the twofold electricity, the positive and the
negative<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hist. of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. vii. and per. viii. sect. 3.</NOTE>. Facts imagined, or rashly taken
for granted, have produced numberless errors
in science. All the facts on which true sci∣ence
can be built, must be exhibited by me∣mory;
the operation by which they are im∣mediately
applied, is recollection. This re∣collection
is indeed under the influence of a
<PB N="362" REF="369"/>
piercing imagination. Imagination excited by
a present perception, puts us upon searching
for the proper experiments and observations;
it is often by relations fit to affect itself alone,
that it gives us the first hint of these, but me∣mory
is the power which it sends, as it were,
in search of them, and by means of which it
finds them. Imagination instigates us to recol∣lection,
and gives our recollection the proper
aim; but it is by memory that this aim is ac∣complished.
It is the only guide to <HI>truth,</HI> the
object and the end of science.</P>
<P>IT is not so in the arts. When the painter
draws a figure or a landscape, when the poet
conceives a description, a character, or an
event, it may be such as he has really ob∣served,
and remembers, and may be only by
fancy drawn out of the repository of memory,
and applied in the proper place. But it is not
of importance whether it be or not; its be∣ing
attested by memory, its being exactly like
to something observed, are not the circum∣stances
to which the artist principally attends;
though it has never been observed, it may be
productive of <HI>beauty,</HI> and this is all that is re∣quired
in the arts. Human invention is not
so fertile, as to be able to diversify its produc∣tions
sufficiently, without ever employing
<PB N="363" REF="370"/>
memory to copy from the reality of things;
and therefore this latter faculty is a necessary
and useful auxiliary to fancy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It is a just observation of the ingenious and elegant au∣thor of <HI>A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian,</HI> “Truth makes an impression on the mind far beyond any fiction; and no man, let his imagination be ever so strong, relates any events so feelingly as those in which he has been in∣terested; paints any scene so naturally as one which he has seen; or draws any characters in such strong colours as those which he has personally known.”</NOTE>. Many
figures and scenes in the works of the most
original painters, are such as they remem∣bered
to have seen: many descriptions, cha∣racters,
and details, in the works of the most
inventive poets, are such as memory retained.
Even Michael Angelo is said to have transfer∣red
into his <HI>Last Judgment,</HI> several entire
figures from the paintings of Luca Signorelli.
Giacomo da Porte took the ideas of most of his
figures in very numerous and highly esteemed
history-paintings, from his own family and
acquaintance. Francisco Albani designed his
Venuses and his Cupids by his own wife and
children. Most of the fables of Shakespear
himself, are such as he found already con∣trived.
But when fancy has force enough to
produce scenes, figures, characters, fables, or
beauties of any kind, without that aid from
memory, we are so far from being displeased
with the want of it, that, on the contrary, pro∣vided
<PB N="364" REF="371"/>
memory and judgment have been con∣sulted
so far as to enable fancy to represent
things as they may have been, we regard genius
as the greater and the more original for not
standing in need of farther aid. Deviations
from the reality of things, which would dis∣grace
science, and be absolutely inconsistent
with its genuine end, contribute to perfection
in the arts.</P>
<P>GENIUS for science and genius for the arts,
are likewise assisted, principally, by different
species of memory. A capacity of strongly
remembering separate objects, is far from be∣ing
unnecessary in the investigations of sci∣ence:
many of the phenomena which Nature
exhibits, or which experiments disclose, are
simple objects; and every phenomena must
be attended to and retained, else the conse∣quence
will be, either that no conclusion can
be formed, or that the conclusion must be
wrong. But a turn for accurately remem∣bering
the connexions of things is likewise
absolutely necessary, and of capital import∣ance.
To retain lively ideas of the several
separate appearances, will contribute little
to promote science, except we also have ob∣served
and remember the precise situation in
which the appearances occurred, all the cir∣cumstances
<PB N="365" REF="372"/>
which attended them, what ap∣pearances
preceded, what were consequent,
and what contemporary, how they came on,
varied, and again went off. That fluids ascend
in exhausted tubes, was always known; but
no legitimate conclusion could be drawn from
this appearance, as long as it was taken for
granted that they would ascend to any height:
it was only when the exact heights to which
they rise were observed, that a discovery was
made of the cause of their ascent, the pressure
of the air; a discovery which has led for∣ward
to many others both curious and useful.
Phenomena imperfectly observed, can produce
no just conclusions; and a confused or im∣perfect
remembrance of phenomena, will ob∣struct
the justness of the conclusions, as much,
and in the same ways, as if some of their es∣sential
circumstances had been wholly over∣looked.</P>
<P>IN the arts, the memory of separate objects
must be very strong and lively: the artist must
conceive them strikingly, that he may be able
to represent them strikingly, Memory of the
connexions of things is often of great utility:
but it is not always absolutely necessary to re∣tain
all their real connexions with precision.
<PB N="366" REF="373"/>
Even in a professed imitation of a real object,
a full and minute exhibition of all its circum∣stances
is not insisted upon; a selection of
such as, according to the art by which the
imitation is made, will produce the greatest
beauty, is not only allowed, but approved. In
a portrait or a landscape, likeness to the ori∣ginal
is indispensable; yet in both it is ex∣pected
that real genius will set that original
in an advantageous light, heightening its ex∣cellences,
and extenuating its defects. What
has been observed in one situation, is often ac∣commodated
by the artist to his own subject;
but he is at liberty to represent it independent
of the things in connexion with which it was
observed, to transfer it into a different situa∣tion,
and to alter many of its circumstances;
nay, if he take not this liberty, he will be
blamed as too servile and painful a copier of
Nature, and accused of poverty of invention.
Though the artist's remembrance of real
things be accurate, fancy must not borrow the
whole, but snatch what suits its purpose, and
make it its own. A species of memory more
accurate than it is allowed to make use of in
the arts, cannot be reckoned necessary to ge∣nius
for the arts: on the contrary, it might
<PB N="367" REF="374"/>
hurt this genius, by leading into minute de∣tails,
and too circumstantial descriptions or de∣lineations.</P>
<P>THE natural appearances which are useful
in productions in the arts, must always be
such as are in some respect striking. To ren∣der
memory, therefore, subservient to genius
for the arts, it is sufficient that it be fit for re∣taining
ideas of such appearances as have made
a strong impression on the senses, as have
forced attention, as have pleased taste, as have
excited some passion or emotion, as have
seemed peculiar and distinguishing. It is in
a person whose perceptions are readily ren∣dered
strong and durable by these circum∣stances,
that memory will be qualified for depo∣siting
materials fit for being employed in the
arts. But the appearances which are of im∣portance
in scientific investigations are of a
different sort, generally noways striking in
themselves, often apparently inconsiderable.
The perceptions of them being thus weaker
than those of the other sort, a greater natural
strength of memory is necessary for retaining
them. The memory must likewise be turned
for deriving strength from such circumstances
as suit the nature of these appearances. The
mind must be prone to close and continued
<PB N="368" REF="375"/>
attention, that this may infix in the memory
perceptions too weak for laying hold of it by
their own power. It must be prone to sup∣pose
importance in appearances seemingly
trifling and unpromising; to look forward to
their tendency and consequences with a high
curiosity and eager pre-expectation, that, if
they turn out in the manner that was looked
for, the gratification of that principle may im∣press
them indelibly on the mind, or, if they
turn out otherwise, that principle may be
again excited, which will impress them no
less indelibly. It is when circumstances of
this kind have the principal influence on ren∣dering
remembrance strong, that memory is
fit for giving assistance in scientifical disco∣veries.
In the writings of every person who
has been remarkable for such discoveries, we
perceive plain evidences how much power
these circumstances had over his mind.</P>
<P>THE connexions of things which must be
represented in the arts, are not the same with
those connexions which must be observed in
the sciences. The artist is concerned chiefly
with the resemblances of things, and these of
the more sensible and striking kinds; and, in
subordination to these, with their obvious con∣trasts,
their peculiar and discriminating cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
and their more signal causes and
effects: the philosopher is concerned with
their causes, effects, and laws; and, as con∣ducive
to the discovery of these, with their
precise qualities and adjuncts, their more hid∣den
similitudes and analogies, and their more
secret differences and contrarieties. Memory
is adapted to genius for the one, or genius for
the other, according as it is turned most for
being affected with the former sort of con∣nexions,
or with the latter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the two Kinds of Genius differ in respect
of the Assistance which they derive from
Judgment.</HEAD>
<P>BY imagination, with all the assistance
which it can receive from the best
adapted memory, neither brightness nor pene∣tration
is completed. But in this respect
there is a considerable difference between them.
Some degree of brightness may arise merely
from the imagination; but no degree of pene∣tration
can; the lowest degree of this cannot
possibly exist without acuteness of judgment.
Accordingly, though we may with great pro∣priety
speak of brightness of fancy, it would
<PB N="370" REF="377"/>
be absolutely improper to use any expressions
which implied our ascribing penetration to
this faculty alone.</P>
<P>THAT judgment assists genius of every
kind, in suggesting such ideas as suit the pur∣pose,
was formerly shown. In the sciences,
in producing the materials fit for the investi∣gation
of truth, this assistance is indispensably
necessary. The decisions of judgment con∣cerning
objects or ideas already produced, con∣sidered,
and compared, suggest to the imagi∣nation
other ideas associated with these deci∣sions,
and fit for carrying forward the investi∣gation.
Judgment is employed in giving such
decisions, at every step that is taken; and they
are the only means by which we can be car∣ried
forward another step. In the arts too, the
decisions of judgment do often suggest new
ideas; but the ideas absolutely necessary may,
in many cases, be suggested by other means.
A rapid imagination often, without giving
judgment time to interpose, pours in, by its
own force, a great abundance of conceptions,
so proper, that when they are afterwards re∣viewed,
the acutest understanding, and the
nicest taste, can scarce find fault with them.
In the arts, this rapidity of imagination, which
waits not for the interposition of judgment,
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
often produces a noble boldness and freedom
of manner; in science it could produce only
absurdity and error.</P>
<P>IN science, an acute and vigorous judgment
is necessary for making any use of the concep∣tions
which imagination has suggested. It is
the precise business of science to deduce con∣clusions
from certain observations, experi∣ments,
or ideas; but the deduction of these is
altogether the work of judgment, and will be
performed with greater or less advantage, in
proportion to the degree of its acuteness.
We sometimes meet with persons who are re∣markable
for making uncommon reflections
on the tritest subjects, or drawing new con∣clusions
from the most familiar facts: this is
acknowledged to imply real ingenuity; but it
shows chiefly acuteness of judgment. The
commonness of the facts or the subjects, makes
no great force of imagination requisite for
bringing them into view; they had actually
been in the view of hundreds: but these had
not the quickness of understanding which has
led to the new conclusions or reflections.
Many of the facts on which Newton founds
his theory of gravitation, and that of light
and colours, require no great degree of ima∣gination
<PB N="372" REF="379"/>
to bring them into view, and had
actually been observed by many. That the
same conclusions were not by these deduced
from them, may be ascribed partly to a defect
of imagination, preventing their being set in
that light in which they would have readily
suggested the conclusions, and partly to the
want of such depth of judgment as was suffi∣cient
for deducing them. Depth of judgment
contributed perhaps more than vigour of ima∣gination,
to enable that great philosopher to
perceive the tendency of common facts with
surprising quickness, and to trace their conse∣quences
with singular accuracy. It was in
the contrivance of new experiments, proper
and decisive, that the vigour of his imagina∣tion
showed itself. Any one proposition in
Euclid's Elements, follows necessarily from
those which precede it; and the work of ima∣gination
necessary for the demonstration of
it, is in a great measure performed by the
laying down of these in a natural order and
series. Suppose then a person perfectly ma∣ster
of the first forty-six propositions; he has
all the principles necessary for demonstrating
that the square of the hypothenuse of a right∣angled
triangle, is equal to the squares of the
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
other two sides. To conceive this proposition
of one's self, would, however, show a great
degree of genius, a vigour of imagination as
well as of judgment. If the proposition were
mentioned to him, and he were informed,
that it is deducible from the propositions al∣ready
demonstrated, it would still require a
considerable vigour of both these faculties, to
conceive the figure necessary for the demon∣stration,
and to make out the several steps of
it, without assistance. If even the figure were
described, it would indicate some degree of
genius, immediately to perceive the whole
train of the proof: but in this case, a very
great part of the work of imagination is per∣formed
by the teacher; it is chiefly acuteness
of judgment that is necessary for accomplish∣ing
what remains. In the more intricate
parts of mathematics, it requires greater vi∣gour
of judgment, as well as of imagination,
to see several steps before us; and to be ca∣pable
of this, shows a higher degree of ge∣nius.
Thus, from the very nature and end
of scientifical invention, judgment is con∣stantly
and intimately connected with imagi∣nation
in all the operations of genius; and a
great acuteness of judgment is necessary for
<PB N="374" REF="381"/>
enabling genius to show itself.—But in the
arts, the ideas collected are not applied to the
deduction of conclusions, which is the proper
work of judgment, and requires reasoning.
They are applied to a quite different purpose,
to the production of beauty, which imagina∣tion
can in some measure accomplish by itself:
and therefore it is not absolutely necessary,
either that the operations of judgment be so
intimately blended with those of fancy, or
that so great a degree of judgment be pos∣sessed.</P>
<P>THERE is an essential difference between
those relations which are predominant in ge∣nius
for the arts, and those which are predo∣minant
in scientific genius. The former are
intuitively perceivable, the latter are not.
Both of them can affect the imagination and
suggest ideas, by them connected with the
present object, without our having previously
perceived by an exercise of judgment, that
these relations belong to the ideas: but it is
natural for us, after ideas have been in this
manner suggested, to reflect on the relation
which subsists between them and the objects
that suggested them, and to form judgments
concerning it. Now when resemblance, the
<PB N="375" REF="382"/>
predominant relation in genius for the arts,
has suggested an image, a single glance of
thought is sufficient for perceiving the reality
of the resemblance; it is self-evident, it re∣quires
no sensible exertion of mind. This is
not the case with the relations of cause and
effect, and co-existence, the prevalent rela∣tions
in scientific genius. They are not intui∣tive
relations; they are perceived to belong
to objects, only in consequence of experience;
they are ascertained by a careful examination
and induction. This implies a sensible and
continued exertion of judgment and reason.
A considerable degree, therefore, of the exer∣cise
of these faculties is rendered essential to
scientific genius, by the nature of those rela∣tions
about which it is ultimately conversant.</P>
<P>WERE these the only relations with which
scientifical deductions are concerned, and re∣semblance
the only relation that affect the
imagination in invention in the arts, there
would be a very great difference with respect
to the degree and kind of judgment necessary
for assisting genius in these two provinces.
But both in science and in the arts, all the
relations which perceptions can bear to one
another, are, in subordination to these predo∣minant
<PB N="376" REF="383"/>
ones, employed for introducing pro∣per
conceptions; and consequently there is
scope in both, for the exercise of the kinds of
judgment adapted to all the classes of rela∣tions.
This makes the difference much less;
every species of judgment may give some
assistance, both in science and in the arts.
Yet still the difference is very considerable:
for even when the same species of judgment is
employed in these two, one modification of it
is useful in the one, and a different modifica∣tion
in the other. A judgment, for instance,
adapted to the perception of mathematical
truths, is in some measure necessary to the
painter; but it is a judgment rather of the
practical result of the truths demonstrated,
than of the precise connexion of these truths
with the principles on which they depend.
The painter and the poet, as well as the phi∣losopher,
must pay a regard to experience;
but so exact an agreement to what we have
experienced, is not necessary for our approv∣ing
the works of the artist, as for our admit∣ting
the conclusions of the philosopher. In
general, the exacter forms of every species of
judgment are requisite in science, the looser
forms are sufficient for the arts; the more
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
laborious exertions suit the former, the rea∣dier
exertions, the latter; the sciences de∣mand
uncommon depth and force of reason,
the arts need rather a certain quickness of
discernment.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable difference between
genius for science, and genius for the arts,
in respect of the assistance which they receive
from judgment, is, that taste, or the judg∣ment
of beauty, is essentially necessary to the
latter, but enters not at all into the former.
This is an article of such importance, that it
will require a particular consideration; but
some observations may be made for farther
illustrating the distinction between the two
kinds of genius, which are so much connected
with what has been now said, that it will be
proper to make them, before we proceed to
that.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="378" REF="385"/>
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The two Kinds of Genius farther compared
and distinguished.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a distinction between genius for the
arts, and genius for science, implied in
what we have said of the assistance which they
receive from judgment, or at least easily de∣ducible
from it, That in the arts, imagination
in some measure sketches the whole work; in
science, it cannot. The plan of a poem or a
picture may be conceived by the sole power of
fancy. The associating principles may sug∣gest
abundance of materials suited to the de∣sign.
The same principles will naturally
give these materials different degrees of attrac∣tion,
proportioned to their several degrees of
relation to one another, by means of which
the most nearly related will fall regularly into
the same member, and the whole will ac∣quire,
in a good measure, a proper order and
arrangement. The exertion of judgment will
no doubt contribute much to render the work
more complete; it will cut off redundancies,
rectify disorders, and even supply defects:
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
but still without it, a picture or a poem may
acquire some degree of form. In science, on
the contrary, imagination alone cannot pro∣duce
even the rudest draught or the most im∣perfect
sketch of an invention: it can only
suggest the materials from which judgment
may collect that invention; it must put them
into the hands of judgment, and subject them
to its scrutiny constantly as it suggests them;
and it is judgment alone that applies them to
use.</P>
<P>THIS leads us naturally to an observation
which will give us an opportunity of examin∣ing
and ascertaining some sentiments and
maxims concerning genius, which are some∣times
expressed without sufficient precision:
the observation is, That genius for the arts
holds more of imagination, than scientific
genius. This observation is so obvious, that
it has been often asserted, That imagination
is necessary only for productions in the arts,
not at all for discoveries in science. In conse∣quence
of this received opinion, productions
in the arts have been called exclusively, works
of imagination. The opinion is not just; but
it would not have been adopted so generally
as it has been, if it had not, in appearance,
<PB N="380" REF="387"/>
a strong foundation. It was just now ob∣served,
that in the arts imagination goes far∣ther
towards perfecting its effects, than it can
in science; this contributes to make its in∣fluence
most conspicuous in the arts. In one
view too, genius for the arts does require
greater strength of imagination, than pene∣tration
requires; it implies a great delicacy
and activity of the associating principles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it∣ting
them for being affected by very slender
relations: this also renders the operation of
fancy more obvious and more striking. Be∣sides,
the associating principles which are
chiefly implied in brightness, are more com∣monly
referred to the imagination, than those
which are predominant in penetration. The
cause of this seems to be, that the former are
perceived without reasoning, are applied ge∣nerally
to the purpose of pleasing, and, even
when they give rise to judgments, occasion
not any process of argumentation, but only
intuitive decisions, which give little exercise
to the understanding, and are scarce taken
notice of; but the latter cannot be perceived
without the exercise of reason, they are prin∣cipally
used for deducing conclusions, and the
conclusions to which they lead, imply a con∣tinued,
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
often a laborious exercise of judg∣ment,
which cannot fail to be reflected on.
Hence it is natural to regard the former as
qualities which affect the imagination, and
the latter as relations about which the judg∣ment
is employed; and consequently, if men
do not think with great precision, to refer
only genius for the arts to imagination. It
may be added that genius for the arts makes
use of a greater variety of associating princi∣ples
than scientific genius, and employs them
in a greater extent, and with less limitation:
it avails itself of all the different forms and
modifications of each of them, while very few
forms of any of them can be rendered subser∣vient
to the investigation of truth; and it
alone is influenced by the associating power
of the passions. In all these respect, it may
be asserted with reason, that genius for the
arts holds more of imagination, than scientific
genius, and that its effects may be termed
peculiarly works of imagination. But it is
not true, either that such genius is completed
by imagination alone, or that it is the only
kind that implies imagination.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius has been described
with a like inaccuracy; it has been considered
<PB N="382" REF="389"/>
as requiring only judgment, and not at all
implying imagination. We have seen that it
holds much more of judgment, than genius
for the arts does: this has given occasion for
ascribing it wholly to that faculty; but it is a
mistake. A very ingenious and profound
philosopher has given his sanction to this
mistake; speaking of a work which indicates
a very great degree of scientific genius, not
only uncommon clearness and depth of judg∣ment,
but also strength and even liveliness of
imagination, he disclaims genius, and inti∣mates
that the nature of his work required it
not; “I claim no other merit, than that of
having given great attention to the opera∣tions
of my own mind, and of having ex∣pressed,
with all the perspicuity I was able,
what, I conceive, every man who gives
the same attention, will feel and perceive.
The productions of imagination require a
genius which soars above the common
rank; but the treasures of knowlege are
commonly buried deep, and may be reach∣ed
by those drudges who can dig with
labour and patience, though they have not
wings to fly<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>REID'S</HI> Inquiry into the Human Mind, <HI>Dedication.</HI></NOTE>.” The author's modesty
<PB N="383" REF="390"/>
under-rates his own abilities, and in this in∣stance
renders his decision inaccurate. That
turn of imagination which fits a person for
productions in the arts, may no doubt be
most properly said to soar, to fly, and to
have wings. To dig with labour and pa∣tience,
is a metaphor which may with equal
propriety be applied to the investigation of
philosophical truth; it is strongly expressive
of the intense and continued exertion of judg∣ment,
which is requisite in observing all the
circumstances of the several experiments, dis∣cerning
which of them are essential, compar∣ing
them together, and tracing out the result
of the whole: but the metaphor must not be
overstrained, it must not be understood so
strictly as to represent the philosopher as a
mere drudge, destitute of fancy; without great
vigour and activity of imagination, the expe∣riments
and observations made use of in that
curious work, or in any philosophical enquiry
of a like nature, could not be contrived,
suggested, and arranged, so as to lay a foun∣dation
for legitimate conclusions. The <HI>In∣quiry
into the Human Mind, on the Principles
of Common Sense,</HI> shows not merely great acute∣ness
of judgment, but also a very high degree
<PB N="384" REF="391"/>
of that penetration in which force of imagi∣nation
is an indispensable ingredient. After
the author has unfolded his important disco∣veries,
another man may feel and perceive
the several operations which he describes, by
giving even less attention than he bestowed,
and without possessing any share of genius;
but genius was absolutely necessary to the
making of the discoveries. The work is not,
in the ordinary sense, a production of imagi∣nation;
but it displays imagination and ge∣nius,
though of a different kind from what
is displayed in a picture or a poem, yet soar∣ing
as much above the common rank. In
science, the operation of judgment is more
obvious and striking than in the arts; it is
it, not imagination, that finishes the work;
and therefore even that part of the work,
which imagination alone can accomplish, and
which indicates genius, has been ascribed to
judgment.</P>
<P>IN commending a person, it is common to
bestow all excellence upon him, and to deny
others their real merit in order to exalt him.
The same cause from which this appearance
proceeds in ordinary life, has produced the
inaccurate descriptions of genius now men∣tioned.
<PB N="385" REF="392"/>
Because imagination can do a great
deal in the arts, genius for them has been
placed in imagination alone. Because it can
by itself do little in the sciences, it has been
excluded from scientific genius; and because
judgment has a great share in the whole pro∣cess
of every discovery which belongs to this
department, all has been ascribed to it. But
as a sensible man allows those whom he com∣mends,
their proper kind and precise degree
of merit, so we ought, with a just discernment,
to give each of these faculties its real share
in forming every kind of genius.</P>
<P>GENIUS has been defined by some to con∣sist
in the union of a fine imagination and a
fine judgment. According to them, its origin
may be referred with equal propriety to either
of these faculties, or rather a great perfection
of both is alike necessary for its existence.
The extensive influence of judgment in pro∣ducing
works of genius has given occasion to
this definition. But genius ought notwith∣standing
to be considered as a modification of
the imagination. It is no reason against our
considering it in this light, that judgment
attends it in all its exertions. It has been
observed already, that intellectual powers,
<PB N="386" REF="393"/>
essentially distinct in themselves, are fre∣quently
complicated together in their exer∣cise.
Reason, for instance, cannot perceive
the evidence of a demonstration, except me∣mory
be exerted in retaining the several
steps: forgetfulness of these would as effec∣tually
prevent our obtaining a conviction of
the truth of the conclusion, as an incapacity
of discerning the evidence of any of the pro∣positions
included in the proof: but it would
be improper, on this account, to confound
reason with memory. In like manner, though
genius needs the assistance of judgment, yet
it ought to be considered as a faculty distinct
from judgment. Genius consists essentially
in the vigour and in a particular economy or
construction of the imagination: it is in this
that a man must excel, in order to be eminent
for genius: where Nature has bestowed this
in a considerable degree, an uncommon accu∣racy
of judgment is not requisite for found∣ing
a claim to real genius; a moderate share
of it will be sufficient.</P>
<P>COULD the description be at all admitted,
it would be applicable only to scientific ge∣nius.
With respect to this species, the ex∣tensive
and continued exercise of judgment
<PB N="387" REF="394"/>
in prosecuting discoveries, gives the descrip∣tion
a considerable appearance of propriety.
Yet even here it has not entire propriety.
A person may possess strength of judgment
in a very high degree, and the kind of judg∣ment
perfectly adapted to science, and yet
be destitute of scientific genius: he may be
an accurate critic on the investigations of
others, and yet himself no inventer. Many
persons who could never have made original
discoveries, have explained the discoveries of
others with great distinctness, and decided
between contending theories with great acute∣ness
and solidity. On the contrary, a per∣son
who possesses that particular form of ima∣gination
which fits for scientifical discoveries,
is never wholly destitute of scientific genius;
no such person is ever found without a de∣gree
of judgment sufficient for enabling him
to make some discoveries. If his judgment
be not so deep and sound as to prevent his
falling into mistakes, yet his investigations
will show ingenuity notwithstanding his
mistakes. The theories of Des Cartes, Leib∣nitz,
Malebranche, Berkeley, must be acknow∣leged
to be ingenious, though in many par∣ticulars
they be not just: these philosophers
<PB N="388" REF="395"/>
had genius, they possessed very considerable
powers of imagination, but not judgment
proportionably piercing. Even in scientific
genius, therefore, imagination is the leading
faculty: where it prevails and is suitably
constructed, such genius is never totally
wanting; and without this, no degree of
such genius ever can exist.</P>
<P>BUT in genius for the arts, an uncommon
strength of judgment is so far from being
necessary, that a degree of imagination which
would have produced genius, if it had been
joined to an ordinary judgment, may be
rendered abortive, and unable to display itself,
by being united to a very nice judgment.
The great acuteness of this faculty will dis∣cover
every the smallest blemish in what
fancy produces, and will, by scrupulously
canvassing it and requiring greater excellence
than the imagination can attain, extinguish
its ardor, and make it give over attempting to
invent, or else enervate its inventions, deprive
them of force and spirit, and subsitute an
insipid correctness in its place<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Evenit plerumque ut hac diligentia deterior etiam fiat oratio.—Nam illa quae curam fatentur, et sicta atque composita videri etiam volunt, nec gratiam consequuntur, &amp;c.

Raphael and Michael Angelo; but the exces∣sive

his genius in a great measure useless; he not
only was extremely tedious, but also could
never please himself, or be satisfied with any
of his own works. It was the same cause
that made Virgil enjoin his friends to burn
the Aeneid; it was not finished with all the
exactness that the nicety of his judgment re∣quired:
had the injunction been obeyed, it
would have been a striking instance of the
effects of very great genius blasted by an ex∣cessive
degree of judgment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Protogenes, whom Apelles blamed for hurting his works by correcting them too much, and Leonardi da Vinci, who left many of his pictures unfinished, because he could not finish them suitably to his high idea of perfection, are appo∣site examples here; but having had occasion to quote them elsewhere, the former, <HI>Essay on Taste,</HI> Part II. sect. 6. the latter, <HI>Ibid.</HI> sect. 5.

<PB N="390" REF="397"/>
then, an uncommon acuteness of judgment
is so far from constituting genius, that it will
absolutely destroy genius, unless the imagi∣nation
be as uncommonly comprehensive.
The former faculty must not have greater ac∣curacy
than is proportioned to the extent and
vigour of the latter. Judgment must pre∣serve
imagination from losing itself in its ex∣cursions,
without obstructing its visiting freely
all the regions of nature. It must prevent
unnatural associations, without checking such
as are bold. It must regulate, but not destroy
the impetuosity and ardor of the soul. It has
been observed that, though systems of pre∣cepts
in the arts, direct and improve the
judgment, they rather curb and restrain ge∣nius.
They render men so studious to avoid
faults, that they scarce aim at beauties. It
is remarked that, when works of imagination
have been brought to the utmost degree of
correctness in any age or nation, there has
been afterwards very little display of original
or extensive genius. This may have been
owing in part to natural causes, which seem
never to suffer an age illustrious for arts and
sciences, to be of long continuance: but it
has probably been owing in part likewise to
<PB N="391" REF="398"/>
the cause that is more commonly assigned;
That a taste for correctness being once gene∣rally
established, the necessity which artists
were under of producing this quality, in
order to gain approbation, cramped their
imaginations and dispirited their works.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Taste essential to Genius for the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>THE observations which were formerly
made upon the difference between ge∣nius
for the sciences, and genius for the arts,
in respect of the assistance which they receive
from judgment, regarded chiefly the degree
and manner in which judgment is exercised
in their operations. But these two kinds of
genius imply likewise different kinds of judg∣ment.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius requires only that kind
of judgment which has <HI>truth</HI> for its object;
but it requires great strength of judgment in
that kind. As that kind includes several
species, the predominance of one or another
of these, will adapt genius to the correspon∣dent
subject of investigation: but any one of
<PB N="392" REF="399"/>
these species prevailing along with a congru∣ous
turn of imagination, will produce some
form of scientific genius.</P>
<P>GENIUS for the arts does not exclude that
kind of judgment which perceives truth:
it demands not, however, an eminent degree
of it. But another kind of judgment, that
which pronounces concerning <HI>beauty,</HI> and is
ordinarily called <HI>taste,</HI> is essential to such ge∣nius.
This is at once a distinctive character
of genius for the arts, and a common charac∣ter
of genius in all the arts.</P>
<P>TASTE, as has been already observed in
general, influences genius for the arts, in
all the same ways in which the discernment
of truth influences genius of every kind:
and the varieties of taste, and those of judg∣ment,
have similar effects in diversifying the
forms of genius. Taste regulates fancy, in∣stigates
it, and contributes to give it habitual
regularity; it performs these offices more or
less perfectly, and performs them in one
manner or one respect, or in another, accord∣ing
to the degree in which it is possessed, and
the species of it which predominates.</P>
<P>IN the artist, taste exerts itself continually,
restraining, regulating, and directing fancy▪
<PB N="393" REF="400"/>
surveying the conceptions which that faculty
has suggested, approving them when they are
suitable to it, perceiving what is faulty, re∣jecting
what is redundant, marking what is
incomplete, correcting and perfecting the
whole. Without this exercise of taste, the
first rude conception of a design could never
be improved, nor any finished work produced.
Taste defers not its decisions till the concep∣tion
be expressed or the design executed; it
not only intermixes them with the execution,
but makes them to prevent and direct the ex∣ecution.
Where there is true genius, fancy
exhibits its creations so distinctly in the very
moment of their production, that an acute
taste can perceive what they will be when
they are executed, and judge beforehand of
their effect. Acuteness of taste sufficient for
this, is necessary to the artist. If he had
only such a degree of taste as could pronounce,
upon a leisurely examination, when the work
were actually executed, he must have the
whole to begin anew, wherever taste disap∣proved;
and so many things would require
alteration, that the labour of finishing any
work would be infinite. An imagination
truly poetical conceives its ideas in a moment,
<PB N="394" REF="401"/>
so clearly and forcibly, that a vigorous taste
is able to approve or disapprove them before
they are put in words or set off by the har∣mony
of numbers. Were the painter inca∣pable
of forming a judgment of his designs
till he had actually put them upon canvas,
he could scarce ever finish a single picture.
Every inventer in the fine arts, must possess
that liveliness of imagination, and that quick∣ness
of taste, which, when united and jointly
exerted, can put it in his power to foresee the
effect of his conceptions and designs. If his
taste be in any respect imperfect, the kinds
of faults which that imperfection unfits him
for perceiving, cannot be corrected, but will
remain blemishes in his works.</P>
<P>WHEN taste has condemned what the artist
had imagined, he will of course endeavour
to set imagination again a working, and to
direct it into another track, that it may sug∣gest
something which will be approved.
Often it is taste itself that in this case insti∣gates
imagination. Its decisions are percep∣tions
which excite the fancy, give it an im∣pulse,
and suggest trains of ideas connected
with them. When taste condemns, the very
nature of the fault which it perceives, often
<PB N="395" REF="402"/>
suggests something that will be approved.
When it approves, the view which it takes of
its object, may lead to the conception of
something which it will still more highly ap∣prove.
But it is not only by being thus ex∣ercised
about a person's own productions,
that taste gives an impulse and direction to
fancy. All the fine arts are, in some sense,
imitative of Nature; invention in these arts,
is only observing and copying Nature in a
certain manner: natural objects and appear∣ances
are observed by the artist, they are con∣ceived
with distinctness and with force, their
characteristical circumstances are selected, and
so expressed as to imprint the whole form on
the minds of others, with the like clearness
and vivacity with which he himself appre∣hended
it. But, in most instances, it is taste
alone, that directs and animates his observa∣tion
of Nature, makes fancy retain a lively
conception of it, and run into the view of
every thing that can contribute to express it.
Without an impulse from taste, imagination
could not begin to act. Natural appearances
and objects lie open to the observation of all;
they are seen by ordinary persons, as well as
by the poet and the painter. The former
<PB N="396" REF="403"/>
take no notice of them, they have no taste to
perceive their beauties; but by the latter,
these beauties are beheld with delight, and
make a strong impression, which rouses ima∣gination
to spirited exertions. The former
perceives what is exposed to his view, but
grossly, faintly, and confusedly; it can give
no determinate direction to fancy: the taste
of the latter enables him to perceive every
feature, character, and circumstance of his
object with precision and with force; and in
consequence of this, fancy produces a strik∣ing
likeness, a delineation of it lively and
precisely marked. A person may have fine
taste, and yet not be a painter or a poet; he
may want that brightness of fancy, which
these arts require: but if a person be possessed
of this, nothing is necessary to make it blaze
forth, but a high taste of some object adapted
to it. Every peculiarity of taste, by giving
a man peculiar feelings from the objects
which he observes, leads him into peculiar
tracks of thinking, correspondent to it.
Many artists in every way, have proposed to
themselves, some of the most illustrious of
their predecessors, as their standard and their
model: in the choice, they were directed by
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
the peculiarity of their own taste, approving
most the distinguishing excellences of that
master; and that taste has been generally
powerful enough to give their fancy a direc∣tion,
and to stamp their performances with a
character, similar to his. In all imitations,
it is taste that gives genius its particular form
and track. Whenever the degree of perfec∣tion
to which any art has already arrived,
leads forward to new improvements, it does
so chiefly by means of taste; it judgments
on the works already produced, point out
new roads of invention to the imagination.
In like manner, with respect to the great ar∣chetype,
Nature, every difference of taste
will occasion a correspondent difference in
the appearances which engage the attention,
and arrest the fancy, and in the point of view
in which they are considered; and the range
which fancy makes, and the effects which it
produces, will always be suitable and analo∣gous
to those peculiar perceptions of taste,
by which it was put in motion.</P>
<P>TASTE is likewise necessary for forming
genius in the arts, to regularity and correct∣ness.
It is taste principally that, in this de∣partment,
perceives when any of the concep∣tions
<PB N="398" REF="405"/>
produced by fancy, are unsuitable to
the end of the work: without its interposing
its judgment on that end being suggested,
such conceptions could not be rectisied; with∣out
its being in the use of interposing its
judgments, imagination could never acquire
the habit of generally avoiding them. Irre∣gularity
in works of art, is most commonly
owing to some defect in taste; it proceeds
from some wildness of imagination, which
a perfectly good taste would have subdued.
A luxuriant and undisciplined imagination
may introduce into a picture some figure or
attitude, or into a poem some scene or de∣scription
or image, which counteracts the
general effect, or is inconsistent with the pre∣vailing
qualities of the piece; it may blend
something mean with a great subject, or
something ludicrous with a solemn one: taste
sufficiently acute would perceive the incon∣gruity
with so high disgust, as to prevent
imagination from dwelling upon it so long as
fully to conceive it, as at least to reject it
whenever it saw it represented, and as to take
from imagination by degrees all propensity
to run into what were so abhorrent from its
views. The kind of irregularity into which
<PB N="399" REF="406"/>
any artist runs, will always be that which his
particular taste is most unable to correct.</P>
<P>BY acting upon imagination in these seve∣ral
ways, by checking, by instigating it, by
giving it regularity, taste has very great in∣fluence
on genius, and the varieties of taste
contribute much to diversify the form of ge∣nius.
A person's genius and his taste are cor∣respondent.
What he approves, and what he
can produce, are of the same kind, and marked
with the same character. Every peculiarity
of taste shows itself in a man's decisions con∣cerning
the works of others; it shows itself
also in his own works, for by it his fancy is,
in a great degree, influenced in producing
them.</P>
<P>BOTH judgment and taste intermix them∣selves
with the operations of fancy; but they
affect these operations in respects somewhat
different. While reason restrains imagina∣tion
from conceptions which are contrary to
truth, or suggests such as are conformable to
it, taste condemns those which are defective in
sublimity or grace, and prompts to such as have
these qualities. The former rejects what
would render the work false or absurd; the
latter, what would render it in any degree
unpleasing.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="407"/>
THOUGH judgment be a necessary ingre∣dient
in good taste, it can never produce it
without acuteness of the internal senses. If
judgment be strong, but these senses weak or
wanting, the exertions of genius may be re∣gular
and vigorous, so far as judgment could
affect them; but they will be seeble and ir∣regular
in those qualities which are the proper
objects of taste. This is observable in almost
all the productions of rude ages and unpolished
nations, often to a very great degree. In every
age, some person, even among those who are
in several respects approveable, betrays, in
some one particular, a coarseness of genius in∣consistent
with good taste. Images which are
low or coarse, may illustrate a subject with
great exactness or force; to more reason they
would therefore appear unexceptionable; but
the leaft delicacy of taste would be disgusted
with them, and prevent their admission. To
authors who indulge themselves in the use of
them, we may allow strength of judgment,
but must refuse taste: they may have force,
but want elegance of genius. In the most ju∣dicious
and eloquent compositions of our fore∣fathers
who lived some centuries ago, simili∣tudes,
allusions, and incidents are introduced,
so homely or so indelicate, that a nice taste
<PB N="401" REF="408"/>
would be disgusted with the very repetition of
them as examples. Every one has heard of
the low and dirty representations introduced
into some of the Dutch paintings. When
such appearances are very strong, we enter
readily into the distinction between judgment
and taste; we pronounce the author destitute
of the latter, and to this cause ascribe the
grossness of his genius; though the appear∣ances
be not so palpable, we pronounce that
incorrectness or indelicacy of taste has infected
his genius: in both cases we can perceive the
difference between that influence which judg∣ment
has upon works of genius, and that
which the internal senses have.</P>
<P>THESE senses may, on the contrary, be
strong where judgment is inaccurate. In this
case, the artist is qualified for such particulars
as contribute to the beauty and elegance of
his work, but not for those which render it
just and solid. The materials which imagi∣nation
presents, will be applied so as to please
on a superficial view, rather than to satisfy on
a careful examination. This effect is observ∣able
in poets who are brilliant without soli∣dity,
and in orators who are florid but not
argumentative.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="409"/>
CONSISTENTLY with goodness of taste, ei∣ther
judgment or internal sense may predomi∣nate
in its composition: a work will always
bear marks of the predominance of the one or
the other. Congreve possesed an elegant taste,
as well as a sparkling imagination; but a
nicer judgment would have repudiated many
of his flashes of wit, as being unnatural. In
the performances of Pietro Testa, sublime and
noble ideas, a profusion of figures strongly
marked, elegance and exactness of drawing,
show exuberance of fancy and enthusiasm of
genius, united to taste in many respects ex∣quisite;
but incoherence of design, and a jum∣ble
of unconnected figures, render it difficult to
discover his aim, and turn many of his works
into groupes of monsters and chimeras: the
exertion of a more accurate and better in∣formed
judgment, would have prevented this
wildness and extravagance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Essay on Prints, <HI>chap.</HI> 3.</NOTE>. Correggio
shows exquisite judgment in the conduct of
his pieces and the union of his painting; un∣gracefulness
in some of his attitudes, an un∣pleasing
disposition of his groupes, and incor∣rectness
of drawing, betray a taste not, in
all respects, fully proportioned to it. Accu∣rate
<PB N="403" REF="410"/>
<HI>judgment</HI> of the anatomy of the human
body, rendered his drawings perfectly correct;
a <HI>taste</HI> as accurate, would have rendered them
equally elegant<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>. The orations of Demos∣thenes
and of Cicero bear plain marks of a
diversity of taste, as well as of imagination;
they show that the taste of the former held
very much of judgment, and the taste of the
latter, of sentiment or feeling. Demosthenes
is the more convincing, Cicero the more pleas∣ing
orator. The sermons of Barrow and of
Seed, are both eloquent; but in very different
ways: the former shows a copious imagina∣tion
united to the soundest understanding; the
latter a bright and flowing fancy combined
with quick and elegant feelings.</P>
<P>THERE are different qualities in the works
of genius which fall under the immediate cog∣nizace
of judgment, and which require dif∣ferent
kinds of judgment. If an artist be
defective in the kind of judgment adapted to
any one of these qualities, he cannot direct his
imagination in producing it, though in pro∣ducing
other qualities, to which his under∣standing
is adapted, he may be very judicious.
Both the disposition, for instance, of the whole
<PB N="404" REF="411"/>
performance, and the justness of particular
parts, are objects of judgment; a work may
be perfect in one of these respects, and infe∣riour
or faulty in the other. Among the an∣cient
painters, Amphion excelled in the for∣mer,
Asclepiodorus in the latter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Nec deb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat Amphioni de dispositione, nec Asclepio∣doro de mensuris. PLIN. <HI>Nat.

<P>IN like manner, if a person possesses any
one of the internal senses in great perfection,
his imagination will never want a prompter
and a guide in producing the qualities which
are the proper objects of that sense; while it
may fail much in producing the qualities
adapted to such other senses as he possesses in
an inferiour degree. Zeuxis was esteemed the
first of the ancient painters in respect of co∣louring;
Euphranor was admired for the sub∣limity
of his works; both were censured for
neglecting proportion in some particulars<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Depr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>henditur tamen Zeuxis grandior in capitibus ar∣ticulisque. PLIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI> cap. 9.

the former showed an exquisite sense of one
species of beauty, that of colours; the latter,
a taste for the grand and noble; taste for the
<PB N="405" REF="412"/>
beauty of proportion was not perfect in either.
Aristides was defective in the particular in
which Zeuxis excelled, in taste for beauty and
softness of colouring, as well as in the power
of producing it: but in expressing the passions
and affections, he excelled all his predeces∣sors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is omnium primus animum pinxit, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enfus omnes ex∣pressit, quos vocant Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eci <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; item perturbationes: durior paullo in coloribus.

he possessed a quickness and acute∣ness
of feeling, which fitted him for con∣ceiving
strongly, and consequently for expres∣sing
forcibly, the traces with which the in∣ward
emotions mark the features and the atti∣tude.
It was the character of Pyreicus, that he
painted only mean subjects, but painted them
with great beauty<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Humilia quidem secutus, humilitatis tamen summam adeptus est gloriam. PLIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE>: this showed taste, in
one respect grovelling, and in another respect
elegant. A similar conjunction is very re∣markable
in Swift: his writings put it beyond
doubt that he was ingenious, in many respects
judicious, and possessed of a taste for correct∣ness
and elegance of composition; but they
abound with low subjects, gross ideas, and
dirty images, inconsistent with delicacy of
sentiment.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="413"/>
SENSIBILITY of taste, is necessary to its
perfection; it makes a person feel strongly
every beauty or blemish which he perceives.
A lively imagination can never exist where
sensibility of taste is wanting; or if it could,
all that it produced would be frigid and spi∣ritless;
no object could make an impression
sufficient to give it a brisk and active motion.
A great degree of sensibility, if the other per∣fections
of taste were wanting, joined with a
fancy proportionably lively, would carry an
artist into wildness and extravagance. But if
the sensibility be not excessive, and if it be ac∣companied
by the other perfections of taste, it
will only raise vivacity of imagination to a
proper pitch. It is enraptured by every strik∣ing
form, it fills the soul with high enthu∣siasm,
it sets the fancy on fire, it pushes it for∣ward
with impetuosity, renders all its concep∣tions
glowing, and bestows a freedom and be∣coming
negligence on its productions. When
a taste of this construction exercises itself about
what fancy is producing, it approves with so
high a relish, or disapproves with so quick a
disgust, as communicates new vivacity and
force to the efforts of imagination. Great sen∣sibility
of taste contributed not a little to Gior∣gione's
<PB N="407" REF="414"/>
freedom of drawing, strength of co∣louring,
and of relief; and to the boldness,
rapidity, and even extravagance, which are
remarked in Tintoret's manner.</P>
<P>REFINEMENT and elegance of taste has an
effect on fancy, in some respects opposite to
those of sensibility. Where it prevails, it
hinders many forms and appearances striking
to others, from yielding it such gratification
as may make an impression on the fancy.
There is no risk of its running into extrava∣gance;
the danger is, lest it deviate into
quaintness, affectation, and subtilty. Vicious
refinement is pleased with these, and sends
imagination in search of them; they are
adopted, and usurp the place of natural beau∣ties.
But true refinement of taste leads ima∣gination
to reject whatever is coarse, or even
of inferiour beauty, and, penetrating into such
beauties as are most latent, feeling such as are
most delicate, and comprehending such as are
most complex, it enables them to affect and
give an impulse to fancy, and directs it to pro∣duce
not only what is beautiful, but what is
elegant, not only what pleases, but also what
fills the taste, to produce according to the par∣ticular
structure of the imagination, the grace∣ful,
<PB N="408" REF="415"/>
the profound, or the extraordinary. The
artists of simple ages, can scarce attain so great
a refinement of taste, as to avoid, in every in∣stance,
ideas which will appear gross and be∣come
unpleasing in politer times. Even Ho∣mer
admits images in some degree coarse and
indelicate; Virgil, bred in the elegance of the
Augustan age, was directed by an improved
taste, when he imitated him most closely, to
reject some of these images altogether, and to
avoid the offensive part of others. It is the
want of perfect elegance of taste formed by ac∣quaintance
with the best models, that has mixt
stifness and ungracefulness with the great
excellences of Albert Durer, Hans Holbein,
Rembrandt, and even Rubens.</P>
<P>CORRECTNESS of taste secures a person
from approving any but real beauties, or dis∣approving
any but real faults, and enables
him to perceive the precise kind and degree
of both. The justness of its decisions often
gives occasion to a new exertion of imagi∣nation,
where otherwise it would not have
been attempted. But it influences imagination
principally, not by instigating, but by restrain∣ing
and directing it, and forming it to regu∣larity.
A great degree of correctness will
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
perfectly chill a weak imagination, and pre∣vent
its producing any thing. It is related
of Andrea Verrochio, that he was so sensible
of the inferiority of his own figures to one
which Leonardo da Vinci, then his scholar,
had by his order painted in one of his
pieces, that he never afterwards attempted
painting; had his taste determined less justly,
he might have continued to produce works
deserving approbation. If it does not totally
chill a moderate fancy, it will at least check it
so much as to produce a mediocrity, where
nothing is faulty, but nothing pleases highly.
It is the character of Andrea del Sarts, that he
is careful, diligent, and correct, but defective
in life and spirit. Even the fine genius of
Protogenes suffered, in the opinion of Apelles,
by the too great correctness of his taste leading
him to dispirit his pictures by excessive care.
Correctness of taste has disciplined Pope's ge∣nius
so much, that some have refused him all
pretensions to imagination. It is an imagi∣nation
uncommonly bright and vigorous, that
can bear all the restraints which a correct taste
lays it under. It requires these restraints;
without them, great blemishes will be inter∣mixed
with great beauties in its works: by
<PB N="410" REF="417"/>
submitting to them, the immortal works of
Milton would have been cleared of the con∣ceits
and quibbles which disgrace them.</P>
<P>PERFECTION of taste requires the union,
the due proportion, and the regular adjustment
of all its principles. If any principle of taste
be wanting, or weak in comparison with the
rest, imagination misses both the regulation
and the impulse which that principle would
have given it; and its productions bear marks
of its having missed them. Every poet, every
painter, every artist, who leaves in his works
what is disgusting to one of the principles of
taste, while he satisfies the other principle,
shows a defect in their comparative vigour.
They were never perhaps united in any man
in a proportion perfectly exact; while none is
wanting or remarkably defective, some degree
of imperfection is always perceivable in some
one of them, and some other is so exquisitely
perfect as to give taste its predominating cha∣racter;
but still the vigour in which they all
exist, is sufficient for giving taste enlargement
and regularity. When a taste so perfect is
united to a vigorous imagination, it produces
genius in some sense universal, fit for render∣ing
its work really, though not equally, ex∣cellent
<PB N="411" REF="418"/>
in all respects, marked with features
correspondent to the characteristical form of
that taste. It is a piercing imagination thus
directed by a fine taste, that has entitled a few
artists in every way to the first rank. Nei∣ther
Homer nor Virgil is absolutely faultless;
each has his principal and distinctive excel∣lence;
but both have so much excellence in
every kind, as could not have been attained
without perfection of taste, as well as of ima∣gination.
Titian's taste in drawing was not
exactly correct; strength and beauty of co∣louring
was his leading excellence, and showed
the prevailing turn of his taste, which was,
at the same time, in all other respects so good
as to guide his fancy and his pencil into great
delicacy of drawing, agreeable resemblance of
Nature, spirited and characteristical touches,
diversified and graceful attitudes, pleasing ne∣gligence
of drapery, and in a word no ordi∣nary
degree of every excellence. It was the
praise of Raphael, that, though he fell short
of some in colouring, yet while he surpassed
in grace, he likewise was master of more of
the excellent parts of painting than any other
artist. It was a like universality of taste, along
with great power of imagination, that enabled
<PB N="412" REF="419"/>
Hannibal Carracci to unite in himself the per∣fections
of all former artists, and to imitate
them at his pleasure.</P>
<P>IN a word, every work of genius must, in
its characteristical excellences and defects, bear
plain marks of the degree in which its au∣thor
possessed any of the perfections of taste.
Every man's peculiar taste, exerting itself
along with his imagination, puts him on
searching for such conceptions as it most re∣lishes,
on moulding them into that form which
suits it best, on adopting such as it approves, on
avoiding and rejecting whatever it disapproves.</P>
<P>I SHALL take occasion here to remark a
difference between genius for science, and ge∣nius
for the arts, resulting from the diversity
of all the powers employed in these two de∣partments,
and of the manner in which they
are employed, a difference that, for this rea∣son,
falls not properly under any of the par∣ticular
heads hitherto considered. The exer∣tions
of scientific genius have in their nature
a certain sedateness, gravity, and austerity:
genius for the arts operates with a kind of
sprightliness, gaiety, vivacity, or impetuosity.
This difference may be accounted for from the
observations which we have already made.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="420"/>
IT arises in some measure from the different
degrees and manners in which <HI>judgment</HI> is
exercised in these two kinds of genius. All
the exertions of judgment about truth, are in
their nature cool and composed; and in the
operation of scientific genius, these exertions
are almost uninterrupted. An idea is no sooner
suggested than it is examined, scrutinized,
and reasoned upon, and deliberately pursued
through all its consequences: this exercise
calms, and as it were depresses the soul, and
gives a cast of seriousness to the operation of
genius in investigating truth. Invention in
the arts, requires not so continual an exercise
of judgment, and therefore wants that cast.
The exertion of judgment has a greater de∣gree
of sedateness, and more depresses the soul,
when reasoning is necessary, than when the
decision is intuitive; and the more intricate
and laborious the reasoning is, the greater is
the sedateness and seriousness with which it is
pursued. In scientific invention, judgment is
exercised chiefly in reasoning. But in the
arts, an idea suggested, generally appears fit or
unfit at first sight, and is adopted or rejected
in an instant; even when it needs to be
canvassed, this is done without a laborious
<PB N="414" REF="421"/>
scrutiny, and therefore without introducing
solemnity of disposition.</P>
<P>THE perception of <HI>truth</HI> is an indifferent
feeling; the sentiments of <HI>taste</HI> are not indif∣ferent:
the conclusions which the philosopher
forms in the course of his investigation, are
apprehended without any sensation of plea∣sure;
the work of the artist, in the several
steps of his progress, is continually gratifying
his taste, giving him sensations of delight, and
by means of these elevating his mind and en∣livening
his temper. The inventer in science
has often indeed high pleasure from the con∣sciousness
of success; but the artist enjoys this
in common with him, and has all the plea∣sures
of taste superadded to it. If the philo∣sopher's
pleasure in the gratification of his cu∣riosity
is to be considered as distinct from the
agreeable consciousness of success, yet it is a
satisfaction of a more sedate nature than most
of the gratifications of taste, and therefore less
fit for enlivening the soul.</P>
<P>THE exertions of the <HI>imagination</HI> have in
themselves something brisk and sprightly;
but those exertions of it, which enter into sci∣entific
genius, have less of this character than
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lights of fancy roaming through all the
<PB N="415" REF="422"/>
remotest relations, and often likewise animated
by the influence of the passions, which take
place in the arts: and consequently, scientific
genius would be more sedate and composed
than the other kind, though the continued
and laborious interposition of judgment did
not check the natural gaiety and impetuosity
of imagination. The mind is perhaps occu∣pied
with equal intenseness in both kinds of
invention; and hence enthusiasm is common
to both kinds of genius: but the mind is oc∣cupied
in different ways; different faculties
of it are principally engaged. In science,
judgment is employed as much as imagina∣tion;
and in scientific genius, that complexion
is predominant which marks the exertions of
the former: its operations are sedate and com∣posed,
and it is generally attended with soli∣dity
of temper, and with a character whose
very peculiarities have a certain gravity and
stayedness. In the arts, judgment is less fre∣quently
interposed, and it is interposed with
less labour, imagination is left at liberty to
pursue its course without a continual check,
and therefore pursues it with a sort of ala∣crity
and chearfulness, heightened by the ever
returning approbations of taste: genius for
<PB N="416" REF="423"/>
the arts, partakes generally in this tempera∣ment
of imagination; it is sprightly in all its
motions, and is often accompanied with a
turn of character gay, unstaid, or desultory.
Sometimes indeed a melancholy cast is found
along with great genius in the arts; when it
is, it proceeds either from a similar cast of
imagination, or from quick sensibility, the
common attendant of a lively fancy and a de∣licate
taste, too strongly affected by the gloo∣mier
views of human life.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Power of Execution necessary to Genius
for the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius compleats its
operations by <HI>invention;</HI> at least, very
ordinary talents are sufficient for <HI>expressing</HI> its
discoveries, and it is not considered as suffer∣ing
a very great diminution of its proper
merit, from the want of ability for elegant
expression: but genius for the arts implies,
in every case, not only the power of inven∣tion,
but also the power of <HI>execution.</HI> In
different arts, the manners of expression, or
<PB N="417" REF="424"/>
the instruments of execution are so different,
that, without entering into the peculiarities of
these, it is not possible to explain fully this
part of genius. But a capacity of employing
some instrument, so as to express the concep∣tions
of the imagination, is common to ge∣nius
for all the arts. Some observations will,
therefore, be proper, concerning that capa∣city,
so far as it is thus common. This is all
that we shall attempt at present.</P>
<P>A CAPACITY for execution is sometimes
found in a person who has no power of inven∣tion;
but when it is, it implies not any de∣gree
of genius. There are mechanics who
can execute a machine from a model or pat∣tern,
with great dexterity and neatness, who
could not have contrived that machine, who
could not so much as have conceived it from
a description, and who could not make any
improvement on the structure of the simplest
utensil. There are persons who can paint
very exactly after a copy, but could not de∣sign
an historical picture, or a landscape, nor
even draw a portrait from the life. Persons
incapable of musical invention, may yet be
admirable performers. In poetry, a power
of execution separated from every degree of
<PB N="418" REF="425"/>
the correspondent invention, is perhaps more
rare than in any of the other arts; yet there
are tolerable versifiers, who could not derive
from their own fund, any part of the plan of
a poem. It would be an impropriety to attri∣bute
genius to such persons; it is scarce ever
attributed to them, by those who think with
the least precision; the capacity which they
show, is sometimes termed ingenuity, but it
is always distinguished from that sort of inge∣nuity
which belongs to invention:
<Q>Distat ab ingenio longe manus,—<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY</HI> de arte graph, <HI>ver.</HI> 494.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>says a writer on painting; the observation is
applicable to all the arts.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, there may be some
degree of invention in a particular art, with∣out
a capacity of correspondent execution. A
person may compose in music, who cannot
perform. Many have invented the subject of
a picture, and in idea designed the whole of
it, so that, from their description of their
conception, a master might execute it, though
they themselves never used the pencil. Others
might proceed a step farther; they could
sketch out the piece, without being able to
<PB N="419" REF="426"/>
colour it. It is remarked of Pietro Testa,
that in drawings, his execution is both ma∣sterly
and correct, but notwithstanding this,
and notwithstanding his having possessed in∣vention
sublime and exuberant, he attempted
often, without success, to acquire the art of
colouring. In like manner, a person may con∣ceive
the whole plan of a poem, and even
express it agreeably in prose, who cannot
cloath it with numbers. The Telemachus
of Fenelon is a direct example of this. Such
persons possess real genius, and perhaps a high
degree of it, so far as it extends: but they
show not a genius complete in the art to which
it points. In order to compleat genius in any
of the arts, a man must possess the power of
employing a proper vehicle, congruous to the
nature of that art, for conveying the concep∣tions
of his imagination to the senses and the
souls of other men. It is this that puts it in
the power of genius to show itself: without
this, its finest conceptions would perish, like
an infant in the womb; without this, the
brightest imagination would be like a vigo∣rous
mind confined in a lame or paralytic
body. Want of skill in execution was, per∣haps,
the only thing that hindered some of
<PB N="420" REF="427"/>
the earliest painters, and some of the first re∣storers
of the art, who are now neglected and
almost forgotten, from obtaining a very high
rank.</P>
<P>IN every art, expression contains something
mechanical. In painting, the management of
the pencil; in music, the use of the instru∣ment;
in poetry, the artifice of numbers, or
dexterity in versifying, are in a great measure
mechanical. So far, expression may be learn∣ed;
and without exercise, no person can be∣come
perfect in it. The greatest geniuses
have been sensible of this: Apelles made it
a rule to paint something every day<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Apelli fuit alioquin perpetua consuetudo, nunquam tam occupatam diem agendi, ut non, lineam ducendo, exer∣ceret artem; quod ab eo in proverbium venit. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10.</NOTE>. Ti∣tian
for many years copied whatever he un∣dertook,
with great labour and care, that he
might thus acquire an easy manner<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>. But
there are many whom no exercise or instruc∣tion
will be sufficient for rendering masters of
it. A certain turn of mind is necessary for
acquiring it: and that turn of mind which
sits a person for learning easily and well the
mechanical part of expression in any particu∣lar
<PB N="421" REF="428"/>
art, is an ingredient in genius for that
art.</P>
<P>A GOOD deal of previous knowlege is like∣wise
necessary for a person's executing in any
of the arts. Knowlege, for instance, of the
words of a language, of its structure, of the
measures which suit it, is prerequisite to the
poet; knowlege of anatomy, of perspective,
of the nature of colours, to the painter. But
a turn of mind congruous to the particular
kind of knowlege, will assist him greatly in
acquiring it; and an imagination suited to
any of the fine arts, is absolutely necessary for
enabling him to perceive, nay for prompting
him to consider, how his knowlege may be
applied to that art. In the moment of execu∣tion
also, imagination is employed in suggest∣ing
this knowlege, and rendering it subservient
to the present purpose. Such a turn of mind,
and such a structure of imagination, as fits
for this, is necessary for compleating a genius
for the arts.</P>
<P>THE power of expression, so far as it dif∣fers
both from mechanical dexterity, and from
knowlege acquired by study, consists perhaps
entirely in a capacity of setting objects in such
a light that they may affect others with the
<PB N="422" REF="429"/>
same ideas, associations, and feelings, with
which the artist is affected. This capacity
arises chiefly from such force of imagination
as at once renders the conception of things
precise and definite, and leads a person to
foresee readily what effect every touch in the
expression will produce, or to conceive quickly
the proper means of producing any desired
effect. This is obviously resolveable into asso∣ciation,
and therefore will, in every art, be
found to spring from the same principles of the
mind, which form the source of invention in
that art. It is quickness and readiness in thus
foreseeing and conceiving, that in a great mea∣sure
renders the execution spirited; it alone
can prevent the necessity of frequently alter∣ing
and retouching, which never fails to pro∣duce
deadness and languor.</P>
<P>IT sometimes happens that particular cir∣cumstances
render it impossible to employ the
most obvious and direct means of producing a
certain effect. It shows great power of ex∣pression
to contrive readily, in such a case,
some other means less obvious. The most
natural means of marking the principal figure
in a picture, is by the strength of the lights;
a peculiarity in the disposition may sometimes
<PB N="423" REF="430"/>
prevent the painter from using this means,
and he may notwithstanding render his prin∣cipal
figure conspicuous, by a peculiarity in
the colouring. The contrivance of Timan∣thes,
an ancient painter, is well known, and
has been often applauded: in the sacrifice of
Iphigenia, being unable to give to the father
a greater degree of sorrow than he had given
to the other spectators, he produced the same
effect by concealing his face<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ejus enim est Iphigenia, oratorum laudibus celebrata: qua stante ad aras peritura, cum moestos pinxisset omnes, prae∣cipue patrem; cum tristitiae omnem imaginem consumpsisset, patris ipsius vultum velavit, quem digne non poterat often∣dere. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10. Ut fecit Ti∣mantes, ut opinor, Cithnius, in ea tabula qua Colotem Teium vicit.

QUINT. <HI>Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. ii. cap. 15. See also VALER. MAX. lib. viii. cap. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT always shows real genius to execute
one's beautiful inventions by the instruments
and in the manners which are well known,
and have been long in use. But a much
greater degree of genius was displayed by
those artists who first brought these instru∣ments
into use, or who considerably improved
the manner of using them. If it be true that
<PB N="424" REF="431"/>
Apollodorus was the first who had the art of
expressing the lights and shades in painting,
he by this showed a higher genius in expres∣sion,
than they who have, even with the
greatest success, practised that art, since he
discovered it. Correggio showed great origi∣nality
by introducing a new and peculiar
manner of distributing lights, so as to give
uncommon force and roundness to his pic∣tures<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>.
The poet who first introduced a
measure adapted to a particular sort of sub∣jects,
and used it properly, has a claim to
genius in expression, superior to their's who
have afterwards written poems in that suit∣able
measure. Spenser's stanza may be re∣garded
as one indication of his genius, though
the imitation of it by others has been some∣times
cenfured as injudicious.</P>
<P>IT generally happens, that the expression
of an artist, bears the same character with his
invention. It is natural that it should; the
imagination influences both, by many of the
same principles. Pindar's fancy was wild,
his versification also is irregular. Pope's ima∣gination
was correct, so is his verse. But
sometimes, the invention and the expression
<PB N="425" REF="432"/>
are of different complexions. In invention
Pietro Testa was enthusiastic and incoherent,
but his drawing was elegantly correct. Such
dissonance between the two operations of ge∣nius
in the arts, may arise from a dissimila∣rity
in the turn of his imagination and his
taste. It may arise likewise from a defect, or
from an excellence, in the mechanical part of
expression. A defect in this will render the
organs unable to do justice to the conceptions.
The best poet may express his ideas to great
disadvantage by writing in a dead or foreign
language. Freedom and easiness of invention
is ascribed to Simon Memmi, but the art of
painting was in his time so much in its infan∣cy,
that his execution could not throw off the
contrary character of stiffness. The earliest
works even of Raphael and Titian, show some
driness in the execution, incongruous to their
other excellences, owing either to the want
of practice, or to the imperfect manner of
their masters<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>and</HI> Observation on his Art of Painting.</NOTE>. On the other hand, a
great dexterity in the mechanical part, may
raise the execution to a degree or kind of ex∣cellence,
far beyond the artist's power of in∣vention.
Many painters have very happily
<PB N="426" REF="433"/>
copied a manner of execution very unlike to
their own turn of genius.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Union of different Kinds of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE sum of what has been said, is
this: scientific genius arises from such
vigour of imagination as disposes a person to
be affected chiefly by the strongest and most
important relations of things, particularly by
causation and co-existence, operating power∣fully,
giving a propensity to set every object
in that attitude in which it lays a foundation
for these relations; and making all the other
principles of association to act in subordination
to these; and it requires the assistance both of
an exact and solid judgment, and of an accu∣rate
and distinct memory. Genius for the
arts springs from such liveliness of imagina∣tion
as disposes a person to attend chiefly to
those qualities of things, which lay a founda∣tion
for relations between them and many
others, to be affected by the slighter degrees
of relation, or by the more trivial relations,
especially to be actuated by resemblance, as
his predominant and leading principle of asso∣ciation;
<PB N="427" REF="434"/>
with a memory similarly turned;
and it requires for compleating it, a quickness
of discernment, and great acuteness and live∣liness
of taste; together with the power of
imparting, by means of some sensible instru∣ment,
his own sentiments and conceptions to
other men.</P>
<P>ALL the principles combined in genius,
are very differently modified in these two
species of it; in some principal respects, the
modifications are even opposite. This abun∣dantly
exposes a conceit, which has been very
crudely thrown out by some<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See RUFFHEAD'S <HI>Life of Pope.</HI></NOTE>, in opposition
to the plainest experience, That a man who
has genius in one way, will have equal ge∣nius
in any other way to which he is pleased
to turn himself with equal application; nay,
that there is no original difference between
those who display the greatest genius, and
those who show none: but that all the differ∣ence
between genius and no genius, between
genius of one kind and of another, arises
from education, study, adventitious causes,
and acquired habits. The assertion is irrecon∣cileable
to the commonest appearances in hu∣man
life; and in the whole course of this
<PB N="428" REF="435"/>
enquiry, we have found that there are, in the
principles of human nature, original and per∣manent
varieties which must produce remark∣able
differences in point of genius.</P>
<P>FROM these varieties it would rather seem
to follow, that genius for science, and ge∣nius
for the arts, are incompatible. But this
would be the contrary extreme: experience
shows that they are not. Not to mention
those who have displayed genius in science,
and in the arts most analogous to science, as
those who have been both philosophers and
orators; even more dissimilar forms of genius
have been united. Among the ancients, Pam∣philus
was at once a painter, and a mathema∣tician<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sed primus in pictura omnibus literis eruditus, prae∣cipue arithmetica et geometria. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10.</NOTE>. Metrodorus was reckoned one of
the most learned philosophers, and likewise
one of the most skilful painters, that Athens
produced in his time<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eodem tempore erat Metrodorus pictor, idemque philo∣sophus, magnae in utraque <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cientia auctoritatis. Itaque cum Lucius Paulus, devicto Perseo, petiisset ab Atheniensibus, ut quem probatissimum philosophum mitterent sibi, ad erudien∣dos liberos, itemque pictorem ad triumphum excolendum, Athenienses Metrodorum elegerunt; prosessi eundem in utro∣que desiderio praestantissimum. PLIN.<HI>ib.</HI> cap. 11.</NOTE>. Among the mo∣derns,
Leonardi da Vinci was a painter, sculp∣tor,
<PB N="429" REF="436"/>
architect, musician, and at the same time
a chemist and mathematician. Augustine
Carrachi was a very good painter, excelled in
engraving, succeeded in poetry, and showed
a turn also for music, rhetoric, natural philo∣sophy,
and mathematics. It is remarkable
that both Titian's son Horatio, and Parme∣giano,
entered so deep into chemical researches,
as by them to empoverish themselves.
He garth's <HI>Analysis of Beauty</HI> shows that he
had genius for philosophical investigation;
and his genius in his own art, was very high.
Halley, with a great degree of mathematical,
genius, showed some degree of the poetical.
Beattie's <HI>Essay on Truth</HI> shows him to be a
philosopher; his genius in poetry is confessed.
An union of different kinds of genius cannot
take place except when all the associating
principles have a considerable degree of
strength, and the imagination is, at the same
time capable of a very lively and command∣ing
impression from the particular end that is
in view. It arises directly from that <HI>flexibi∣lity</HI>
of imagination, which was sufficiently
explained already<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Part II. sect. 8.</NOTE>. Great flexibility join∣ed
even to a moderate fancy, will produce a
<PB N="430" REF="437"/>
little genius in various departments; joined
to a fine imagination, it will enable a man to
excel in various ways: the finest imagination,
with little flexibility, will be confined to one
way, or at most be excellent but in one.</P>
<P>INDEED, even when a person unites in him∣self
different kinds of genius, it will be gene∣rally
found, that he excels only in one de∣partment,
and that in others his genius is of
an inferior order. In the subject to which
his genius is most adapted, it exerts itself
with vigour; it follows the associating prin∣ciple
which is naturally prevalent. In the
subject to which it is less adapted, it operates
more heavily; it follows an associating prin∣ciple
which is by <HI>foreign</HI> causes forced into a
temporary predominance. The effects of ge∣nius
in the former case, are like fruits suit∣able
to the climate, which attain their perfect
flavour; in the latter, they are like fruits
raised by artificial heat, in a climate not pro∣per
for them, which remain insipid, and ne∣ver
reach their full maturity. Under the
guidance of the principle of association na∣turally
predominant, the other principles
operate with such alacrity as subjects show in
serving their rightful king; under the gui∣dance
<PB N="431" REF="438"/>
of any other principle, their operation
resembles the spiritless backwardness with
which a people obey an usurper or a con∣queror.</P>
<P>WHEN a person's genius is naturally turned
to one of these objects, science or the arts, it
will require very powerful causes to lead him
to exert it about the other. It will perhaps
be found, that almost no person has done so,
except when he was impelled to it by a pecu∣liar
education, by very forcible example, by
being thrown into a way of life which required
it, or by circumstances of the like nature.</P>
<P>IT may likewise be remarked, that, in some
instances, perhaps in some of those formerly
produced, the union of these dissimilar forms
of genius, is only apparent, not real. <HI>Ge∣nius</HI>
in one way, has been accompanied, not
by the power of invention, but merely by
<HI>capacity,</HI> in the other way. It must be own∣ed,
that generally Nature is more frugal of
her gifts, than to lavish on one man, very
unlike modifications of genius. The greatest
inventers in science, have scarce ever shown
genius in the arts. Aristotle was perhaps the
most inventive among the ancient philoso∣phers;
and his stile, though very precise,
<PB N="432" REF="439"/>
exact, and suitable to the subtility of philo∣sophy,
shows a turn of mind, little adapted
either to poetry or to eloquence; even his
critical works display more of cool judgment,
patient attention, and deep reflection, than of
that ardor of taste, which never fails to attend
genius for the fine arts. On the other hand,
the greatest geniuses for the arts, have gene∣rally
betrayed a want of that precision and
depth which are necessary for scientific inves∣tigations.</P>
<P>SOME have supposed a distinctive peculi∣arity
so strongly impressed by Nature, on every
man of genius, as to assert, that the same
person can scarce excel in two different arts,
however analogous; that no writer, for ex∣ample,
ever almost succeeded both in verse
and prose; nay, that the same person cannot
excel in both the species of dramatic poetry,
tragedy and comedy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">RAMBLER, No. 169.</NOTE>. In support of such
assertions it is remarked, that none of the
ancients undertook both these species of the
drama; and with the same view, the wretch∣edness
of the Roman orator's poetry is often
mentioned. It would be unjust, however,
to estimate the compass of human genius
<PB N="433" REF="440"/>
from such instances. Homer, the father of
the epic poem, hath left a work wholly of the
ludicrous kind. It would perhaps be difficult
to determine whether Shakespear possessed
greater excellence in tragedy or in comedy;
that he possessed very great excellence in both,
is unquestionable. In both, several other mo∣derns
have shown real genius. Many have
likewise been both orators and poets. But
after all, it must be owned that, in most cases,
a man's genius fits him not only for science
alone, or for the arts alone, but also for one
science, or for one art. Many have shown
genius either in mathematics, or in natural
philosophy, or in the philosophy of the mind,
who have discovered none in the rest of these
branches. It appears from Pope's letters,
that he applied to painting with considerable
eagerness, it does not appear that he disco∣vered
any great degree of genius for paint∣ing;
for music, it is said that he had not
even a considerable capacity, though he shows
the quickest sense of the harmony of verse;
if it be true, it would appear that, among the
arts, his genius con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined him almost wholly
to poetry. In humorous painting, Hogarth
was unrivalled; he attempted portrait-paint∣ing,
<PB N="434" REF="441"/>
it is said, with the most wretched suc∣cess.</P>
<P>IT seems then to be the common, though
not strictly the universal, law of human na∣ture,
that genius fits the person who is endued
with it, for invention in some one particular
art, or particular science. Still, therefore,
there is room for enquiring, by what minuter
varieties of the powers combined in genius,
these subordinate differences of its form are
fixt. The enquiry would be laborious and
intricate, but it would be curious, and, per∣haps,
not without utility.</P>
