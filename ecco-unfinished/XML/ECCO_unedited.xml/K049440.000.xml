<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is stiled a <HI>postscript</HI> to this Work, tho' in it self an Introdu∣ction,
so it is principally design'd, to reply to the Postscript of
the <HI>Narrative</HI> plac'd also in the Front of that Work, and also to
give some State of the Case, that such Readers as have not seen the
said <HI>Narrative</HI> may not be in the Dark, for want of having been Ma∣sters
of the Controversie.</P>
<P>In order then to make this plain; The Reader is to understand, that
upon the Abdication of the late King <HI>James, for from thence, it is necessa∣ry
to fetch the short History of this Affair</HI>—The <HI>Presby<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erians</HI> in the West
of <HI>Scotland</HI> first, and the Convention of Estates afterward, made an en∣tire
Church-Revolution in that Kingdom, as the Coming of the Prince of
<HI>Orange, (afterwards King</HI>-William) had done in the State.</P>
<P>It is true, that the poor Western People, whom the Tyranny of Prelacy
had made furious, and under which Tyranny, that miserable Country had
been reduc'd to Desperation, took a course, which neither the Govern∣ment
or Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> were pleas'd or could be charg'd with:
<HI>Not the Government.</HI> Because in the Infancy of the Revolution, it had not
Power to prevent it: <HI>Not the Church,</HI> Because it was done almost a whole
Year before the Church had any Legal Establishment; and therefore as
to the Language of the Law, <HI>was not in being;</HI> and nothing can act before
it exists.</P>
<P>It is true also, that after the Western People had as above, Rabbled the
Episcopal Ministers out of their Part of the Country; the Convention
did not repone them, which now these People complain of; <HI>to which may
be answer'd; First,</HI> It could not be expected, that a Constitution re∣solv'd
to depose Episcopacy it self, should repone Episcopal Ministers <HI>as
such,</HI> tho' they were put out in an unjustifyable Method; if they had
thought fit to conform to <HI>Presbytery,</HI> they could not have miss'd to obtain
other Livings; Ministers being at that time wanted to fill the number of
vacant Churches; and if they would not conform, to what purpose should
they have been repon'd by Authority, immediately to have been Deposed
again.</P>
<P>It is true also, at that Time, the Country which had cast them out, in
Memory of the Cruelties suffer'd under their Hierarchy, would not have
receiv'd them, neither would the Ministers themselves, if in their right
Wits, have ventur'd to have gone among them, or could the Government
have protected them till it it had been better settled.</P>
<P>Thus what by the Western Rabbles first, and the Convention of Estates
afterwards, Episcopacy was Dethroned, and Presbytery establish'd in <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
and this is granting more to them as to the Western Rabbles, than
is strictly speaking due to them.</P>
<P>However, tho' to anticipate the Cavils of the Objectors, we have own'd the
Rabbles in the West did throw out some of the Ministers, yet it is most
certain, that after the first heat, the Revolution in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
was, <HI>generally speaking,</HI> carried with all the Mildness and Tenderness, as
could consist with the Necessity of the Work in general.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
The Bishops being thus displac'd by the Law, and such Ministers as possest
those Livings, of which the former Incumbents <HI>who were turn'd out in</HI> 1662.
were yet living, demitting by a particular Act of Parliament; the rest was
carryed on with all possible Tenderness; and at last an Act of Parliament
was passed, That even those Ministers who remain'd Episcopal, and would
not conform to Presbytery, <HI>yet if they would take the Oaths to the Government,</HI>
should enjoy their Benesices.</P>
<P>By this means, the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> was obliged to content her self, to
see near 200 <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> preaching in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and enjoying the Sti∣pends
and Glebes of the Church, and she was rather satisfied to have it so,
than to proceed by cruel and rigorous Methods to dispossess them.</P>
<P>By this means also, very few <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> became destitute,
except such as obstinately rejected the Oaths to the Governme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and openly
adhered to the <HI>Jacobite Interest,</HI> or such as were scandalous and insufficient.</P>
<P>During the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> these kept themselves pretty quiet,
and we heard very little, either of their disturbing the Church, or of the
Government being uneasie with them: But upon the Accession of Her pre∣sent
Majesty to the Crown, they took hold of the Queen's Letter, obliging
the Privy-Council to protect them, while they behaved peaceably to the
Government, either willfully or ignorantly mistaking Her Majesty's mean∣ing,
and pretending to reckon it a Tacit Toleration, tho' no such thing was
intended.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>this,</HI> they began to show their Heads with an unusual Confidence,
and to erect <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> in all Parts of the Kingdom, <HI>as they had Ac∣cess,</HI>
openly professing their <HI>Jacobite,</HI> as well as <HI>Episcopal Principles;</HI> insul∣ting
the Government, by refusing to pray for the Queen, refusing to joyn
in the Publick Fasts, for Success of the Queen's Arms, or in Thanksgivings
for Victories; some of them <HI>openly</HI> praying for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all of
them <HI>tacitly</HI> and <HI>ambignously:</HI> Besides their Scandalous Invasion of the <HI>Church
Judicatories, Clandestine Marriages</HI> without Publication, Baptizing the Chil∣dren
of Persons under <HI>Church Censure,</HI> to the Destruction of good Discipline
and the Encouragement of Prophaneness and Immoralities.</P>
<P>In this manner they went on with impunity; yet however the Church
found themselves aggriev'd by them, they however remitted their Punish∣ment
to their own itnemperate heat, not doubting, but first or last they
would bring the resentments of God and the Government upon them;
nor did the Government take any notice to punish these Disorders, having
at this time the Great Affair of the Union in View at Home, and a heavy
embarrassing War upon their Heads Abroad; till the following Oc∣casion
alarm'd them, when the Necessity of Things, the Publick Safety,
the Peace of the Nation and the Preservation of the <HI>Queen</HI> upon the
Throne requiring it; the Government found themselves oblig'd to take
new Measurers with these People.</P>
<P>That there was such a Real Necessity, and that it was judged so; first
by the Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards by Her Majesty and the Council
in <HI>England,</HI> these Sheets, will effectually make appear.</P>
<P>It shall be only noted here; That the Enemy appearing, resolv'd to
invade <HI>Scotland</HI> from Abroad, and the <HI>Jacobite Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> at Home, appearing
exceedingly encouraged and elevated, <HI>nor did they keep any extra∣ordinary
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Guard upon their Conduct, in order to conceal their said Elevations</HI>
The Privy Council caution'd by Her Majesty, of the Preparations of the
<HI>French,</HI> and press'd to do their utmost to preserve the Publick Peace
thought it absolutely necessary among other things, to suppress these <HI>Ja∣cobite
Assemblies,</HI> and Preachings, as Places where the general Disaffection
receiv'd Encouragement, and a Faction was kept up against the Queen in
behalf of the Pretender.</P>
<P>This is so plain in all the Proceedings, that it need not be repeated; it
was the only Cause mention'd in the Queen's Letter, in the Councils Or∣ders,
and in the Magistrates Citations; 'tis the only Thing alledg'd in the
Libels against the Ministers—All the pretences of a Perse∣cution
rais'd against <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> are preposterous and absurd; all the Pre∣tences
of it being calculated against, or commenc'd because of the bring∣ing
the <HI>English Service</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> are false in Fact, and have no proba∣bility
in them; on the contrary, 'tis evident, the introducing the said
Service into <HI>Scotland</HI> is a Novelty, calculated to make a shew, as if the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and these People were all one, where as it is evident,
no <HI>Episcopal Ministers,</HI> except those who re <HI>Non- Jurors</HI> have attempted it.</P>
<P>Upon this Prosecution of the <HI>Jacobite Conventicles</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> a Book is
publish'd in <HI>England,</HI> Entitl'd <HI>A Narrative of their Treatment, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which the Sheets hereto annex'd are an Answer.</P>
<P>This Narrative <HI>to give an Abridgment of it,</HI> is a Deduction of the Pro∣ceedings
against the <HI>Jacobite Clergy,</HI> upon the Councils ordering the Ma∣gistrates
of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to shut up their Meetings.</P>
<P>It tells us how they wre cited to appear before the Magistrates, were
there sentenc'd <HI>instead of Banishment, which by Law might have been the
Sentence, to desist from keeping any Meeting Houses, and exercising any part of
their Ministerial Function within the City of</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>&amp;c</HI> and to give Cau∣tion
to observe it; and that in the mean time their Meeting-Houses should
be shut up.</P>
<P>That this Sentence being not regarded by them, but continuing to
preach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They were Cited a second time in <HI>June,</HI> 1708. and for their
not complying, five of them were sent to Prison, and the like; all which
and more is very true, as will be seen in the exact Account of the
Proceedings, Sign'd by the Town Clark of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and annex'd to this
Work.</P>
<P>With this Account, here are long Complaints of the Incompetency of
the Magistrates to be Judges, and the Illegality of the several Parts of the
Proceedings, which are all remark'd and reply'd to in this Book.</P>
<P>But above all, this <HI>Narrative</HI> taking up a Lamentation, makes
loud Complaints of the hardship of being thus press'd totake the Oaths,
defends their refusing to quallify, charges the Government with Cruelty
and Oppression in disturbing them, and pleads their own Inoffensive Be∣haviour,
to argue that the Government is safe in them, ought not
to suspect them, and consequently they ought to enjoy their Liberty, tho'
they did not swear to the Government, or pray for the QUEEN.</P>
<P>As to Swearing, the <HI>Narrative</HI> owns they they cannot do it, <HI>p.</HI> 10.
That they cannot dissemble nor contradict their known Principles, and
swear to a Government when it is uppermost, and then abandon it whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
“down again, and so again as Changes happen, and makes some Reflections
upon those that do so; that the Government ought to let them alone,
tho' they do not swear Allegiance to it, because they say they are of Pea∣ceable
Principles—As to praying for the Queen, the <HI>Narrative</HI> says,
they do pray for all the <HI>Royal Family</HI> and for THE <HI>QUEEN,</HI> and for all
their Rulers, and the like, in which the Queen <HI>say they</HI> must be included, <HI>p.</HI> 13.”</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Narrative</HI> spends a great deal of Time, <HI>and some Art</HI> to per∣swade
the World, that all this Prosecution is meerly for being <HI>Episcopal,</HI>
and more than that, for the acceptance the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> finds in <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
and this is improved to claim Kindred with the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and Interest them in the Quarrel—Tho' at the same time 'tis evident, it
is all for that very <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Principle the Church of <HI>England</HI> has effe∣ctual
cast out in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The rest of the <HI>Narrative</HI> is taken up in piteous Exclamations, of the
Sufferings of the Church of <HI>Scotland, as it would have the</HI> Jacobites <HI>there
be called,</HI> and of Recriminations upon the <HI>Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is a faithful Abridgment, both of the State of the Case, and
of the Substance of the Book we are answering; for the Answer to it we
refer to the Sheets hereto annex'd; only crave leave to say a few Words
to the Postscript plac'd before it, as above. It begins with telling us with
an Air of Lamentation; “how surprizing it is, that those of the <HI>Episcopal
Perswasion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be treated as they are <HI>at this time of DAY,</HI>
when People of all other Opinions in Religion, throughout Her Majes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties
Dominion, enjoy all the Liberty that has been permitted at <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
—-And that the Unprejudic'd Reader will be apt to think, that
these People are Sinners above all their Fellow-Subjects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We must confess this Prefatory Part has much Truth in it, and the
Observation is very Just; in one Part, any one would think so, and upon
Examination every one will find it so; <HI>They are Sinners</HI> in one respect
<HI>above their Neighbours:</HI> The <HI>British</HI> Government under the best QUEEN
that ever Rul'd them, tender of the Ease and Tranquility of all its Sub∣jects,
gives as much Liberty as can reasonably be expected, to the diffe∣rent
Opinions which too too much divide the Nation; nor is there any
Restraint laid upon Her Majesties Subjects, in any thing merely Religi∣ous—But
as in the Case between GOD Almighty and his Creatures,
there is <HI>a Sin</HI> Man may commit, which cannot be forgiven: So to set
up a Rival <HI>to a Sovereign,</HI> is in the State as the un pardonable Sin is in
Religion; No Prince can bear with it, no Government can, or indeed
ought to dispense with it—And here is the accursed Thing; this is the
Crime in which these People are Sinners above their Neighbours; This
is the occasion of all the Uneasiness of the Government with them; And
this is what, thro' the very whole Course of the <HI>Narrative</HI> they defend.
The <HI>Narrative</HI> owns their <HI>Jacobite Principles,</HI> and demands of the Govern∣ment,
to have them Tolerated as other Conscientious Points are.</P>
<P>Thus they would have us make <HI>Jacobitism</HI> a Scruple of Conscience, plead
for its being dispensed with as an Opinion, and in time we may have it call'd
a Religious Tenet; we should not go this Length with them, if the <HI>Narra∣tive</HI>
did not actually mention it in so many Words—<HI>Pag</HI> 1. of the <HI>Post script</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neir words are, <HI>People of all OTHER OPINIONS in Religion throughout
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Her Majesy's Dominions enjoy all the Liberty, &amp;c.</HI> 'Tis true, this Word <HI>O∣THER</HI>
is set against the Words <HI>Episcopal Perswasion</HI>.—But they cannot mean
<HI>that,</HI> because People of the <HI>Episcopal Perswasion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> not only have
Liberty, but are admitted to enjoy their Benefices, and preach in the Parish
Churches all over the Country—150 of the Publick Ministers being to
this Day <HI>Episcopal;</HI> when they say then <HI>all other opinions of Religion,</HI> they
can mean nothing else but the Profession or Opinion of the <HI>Jacobite Religion,</HI>
and what that is, this Tract is not Ill-natur'd enough to describe.</P>
<P>Again, when they acknowledge, That <HI>all other Opinions in Religion through∣out
Her Majesty's Dominion, enjoy all Liberty, &amp;c.</HI> they seem to acknowledge
that their Case is not a Point of Religion, for certainly, if all they say of
themselves were true, that their Behaviour is Peaceable and Inoffensive, their
Principles such, as any Government is safe in, and nothing objected against
their Doctrine; it must be something else which is not Religious, that
obliges Her Majesty to single them out from all the rest of her Subjects to
Punish and Persecute, when her Royal Clemency is extended to all other
People, whose Differences are Religious—Her Majesty could not, with∣out
the utmost Scandal upon her Royal Judgment, as well as upon her
Justice, be thought to Tolerate or forbear all Opinions but that same, of
which Her Majesty her self is perswaded, and in which she expects to go
to Heaven; would Her Majesty for bear <HI>Jews, Prophets, Socinians, Arminians,</HI>
and an infinite number of Erroneous Opinions, not included in the Legal
Toleration in <HI>England?</HI> Would Her Majesty adhere so steadily, and defend
so earnestly the <HI>Toleration,</HI> including <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists</HI> and
<HI>Quakers;</HI> and at the same time that these enjoy Peace and Tranquility, Safe∣ty
and Protection under her Government, suffer an <HI>EpiscopalChurch,</HI> the same
in which she has been educated, in which she is a devout Member, and of
which she is Intitl'd, <HI>The Glorious Defender,</HI> to be the only Persecuted Distress'd
Part of her <HI>Royal Inheritance</HI>—It can never be—No, nor indeed is it
true in Fact; for the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' removed from being
National, is not at all Persecuted—But all those of them who own them∣selves
to be Her Majesty's Subjects, are protected, safe, easie, and quiet; their
Ministers are now Preachers in above 140 Parish-Churches in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
People of that Perswasion can with freedom and safety hear them—And no∣thing
is more certain than this, and we assure the World of the Truth of it;
there is at this time no order given out to suppress any but those who re∣fuse
to acknowledge the Government, and pray for the Queen.</P>
<P>This gives a very unhappy Turn to the whole Cause—The whole
Complaint they make may be granted without any Prejudice to the Ar∣gument—That
to the <HI>Jacobites</HI> who own a spurious Pretender, profess
the Queen to be a Usurper, the Succession an Usurpation, and the Revo∣lution
a Rebellion; the Government does give all possible Disturbance,
tho' that is granting a great deal too much too.</P>
<P>But to the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> in <HI>Scotland, as such,</HI> no Injury, no Damage
is done, no Disquiet given: The Postscript to the <HI>Narrative</HI> contradicts
this, and says, <HI>Pag. 1. No Compliance with the Civil Government avails them;
The Meeting-Houses of the Complyers are shut up, and their Persons Distress'd, as
well as other,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is very unhappy, that we are oblig'd a little to expose the Persons,
here brought as Instances, in order to prove this a Mistake, for Mr. <HI>Herriot</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
of <HI>Musselbrough</HI> was Deposed from his Ministry, both by the Church-Ju∣dicatories,
and by the Privy-Council, as not being a Person fit to
officiate in Sacred Things; the Immoralities and Scandalous Life of
the said Mr. <HI>Herriot,</HI> being prov'd before them. Mr. <HI>Peacock,</HI> as
by the Sheets hereafter appears in the same Predicament, and the
other Persons named, tho' they did pray for the Queen, yet they refused
to take the Oaths—. It does not seem as if this Part of
the Narrative were of a Piece with the other, that there should be no
better Evidence, brought to prove, <HI>that Complyers were equally prosecuted,</HI>
than a few scandalous Ministers prosecuted and expung'd for their Crimes.
It seems something of a Reproach to these People, who call themselves the
Episcopal Church; that the vicious and scandalous Ministers, that the
Church Judicatories censure and depose, should all take Shelter under
them. Is it a question, whether these will take any Oaths, and pass any
Qualifications; and must these be screen'd by their Qualifications, and suffer'd
to keep open Meeting-houses, who ought to be spued out of all Professions,
as not fit to concern themselves about other Peoples Souls, till they ap∣pear'd
more concern'd for their own?—And it seems something of a
Reflection on a certain antient Peer, who is not ignorant either of the Rea∣son
or Necessity of Church Censures, to discourage Vice and Immoralities,
that he should admit a Man to qualifie before him as a Minister, who he
knew was depos'd from being a Minister for Scandal by a legal Proceed∣ing
and Sentence.</P>
<P>We could not desire to have an Argument return'd upon our Narrative
with greater force than this, that whereas ye say, <HI>No Complyance with the
Civil Government avails, but the Compliers are distress'd as well as others.
Narrat. p.</HI> 1. To reply, No Compliers have been distress'd, <HI>or their
Meeting-Houses been shut up,</HI> but such of whom ye ought to be asham'd, and
who it is beneath the Persons we are speaking of to own themselves joyn'd
with—The Ministers process'd before the Magistrates, tho' <HI>Jacobite,</HI>
are allow'd many of them to be Men of good Characters, Men of Honesty,
and Men of Letters, Men of good Breeding, and for whose Persons, <HI>ex∣cept
in the Matters of this HITTITE,</HI> we have great Compassion, great
Concern for their Circumstances, and many Wishes for that Time, when
their Judgments being inform'd, they shall be restor'd to her Majesty as
good Subjects. But the Author of the Narrative must have but small
Thanks from them, when they see themselves link'd by him in the same
Row, or plac'd in the same Class with the scandalous, immoral and in∣sufficient,
who will swear to any side, and adhere to no side, and who be∣ing
all over black with Reproach for just Crimes, must leave some of their
Filth upon the Reputation of any Party they take Shelter with.</P>
<P>It will be no loss to our Argument at all, to throw them all these in∣to
the Article of Persecution; for if suppressing Vice and Immoralities, and
especially rooting them out from among the Clergy, removing Scandal from
the Altar, and purifying the Tribe of <HI>Levy,</HI> be the Sin of the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> if this be what we are calling Persecution; 'tis her Glory that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the most persecuting Church at this Time in the World.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
The Narrative therefore must give some better Proofs, and bring some
other Examples to make it clear, that <HI>no compliance with the Civil Government
avails,</HI> since 'tis certain, no compliance of such Men ought to avail, and
no compliance of other than such has been offer'd.</P>
<P>From this the Narrative falls into another weakness, <HI>as great as the for∣mer;</HI>
and that is, by naming Mr. <HI>Robert Moncrief,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Robert Skeen,</HI> Mr. <HI>George Barklay;</HI> the two first having been obliged to
<HI>Sign an Obligation, not to exerce any Part of their Ministry, &amp;c.</HI> and the
two last being sent to Prison, for refusing to do the like—<HI>And yet that
these had given all the Evidence Men can give of their Loyalty and good Affe∣ction
to Her Majesty, by owning Her Authority, and praying for Her Person
and Government Daily, &amp;c.</HI> Postscript, <HI>pag.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>This we call a Weakness, because it seems as if the Author supposed
no Body would ever examine the Fact it self, and search into its Original
for the Truth; for it cannot but be a weakness, <HI>or something much worse,</HI>
to publish that to the World, which the Author must needs know the
first exact Enquiry will manifestly detect.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> It is necessary to examine the Process, the Particulars of
which is annext to this Work; where it will appear, that however these
four Persons might pray for Her Majesty <HI>Nominatim;</HI> yet that every
one of them acknowledg'd they had not taken the Oath of Allegiance to
Her, nor would they take it when required; how then the Author of
this Book will come off of his saying as above, <HI>they had given all the Evidence
of their Loyalty and Affection to the QƲEEN that Men can give;</HI> We shall
wait to see.</P>
<P>It seems the first Evidence in the Eye of the Law, that Men can give
of their Loyalty and Affection to the Person of the Queen, is to acknow∣ledge
her to be Queen; now 'tis evident, that all these Men refuse to
swear Allegiance to her; how then can they be said to give <HI>all the Evi∣dence
Men can give?</HI> It is true, Men may decline Swearing, and yet
may give Evidence of their Loyalty and good Affection to the Queen;
and this is the Case of several, even of the <HI>Presbyterian Ministers,</HI> who
have their Scruples about the Oaths, <HI>as well as other People,</HI> as an Oath of
Allegiance; and yet give sufficient Testimony of their constant Zeal for
the QUEEN, on all other Occasions; but even of these, no Man will
say, they gave <HI>all the Evidence that Man can give, &amp;c.</HI> But to say <HI>these
Men give all the Evidence that Men can give,</HI> while at the same time their
general Principles are known and justly suspected; and being summon'd,
refuse to take the Oaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is to say what we believe, no Man will un∣dertake
to defend for them.</P>
<P>As to the Proof, that these Men, tho' praying for the QUEEN yet re∣fus'd
to take the Oaths, the Authentick Copies of the Process and An∣swer
of the Ministers particularly annex'd to this Work will make it
clear, where, Mr. <HI>Geo. Barklay</HI> being Interrogate, if he would yet qualifie
himself, desir'd <HI>he might not be troubled on that Account;</HI> those are his
very Words, <HI>See the Process, p.....</HI></P>

Thus far we have follow'd the Author of the Postscript through some
of his Mistakes; but we must touch upon another, which is the main Er∣ror
that the whole Cause turns upon; he enquires, <HI>what is the real

<P>Whether the Author of the Postscript and the Author of the Narrative
be different Persons, or one and the same, is not for us to enquire; but
since both joyn in this Affirmative, we take them as one, and crave leave
to answer the same Question.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Negatively.</HI> Nothing like it; <HI>The Crime of these Men</HI> is neither Epis∣copacy
nor the Worship of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Positively.</HI> Their Crime is meer Jacobitism, profess'd avow'd Jacobi∣tism;
<HI>as such</HI> they answer, for <HI>not one-Question</HI> of Religion has been
put to them; <HI>as such</HI> they were order'd to be prosecuted, for <HI>only such</HI>
are in the Order of the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh;
as such</HI> they were libell'd or indicted, for nothing else is alledg'd in
the <HI>Bill</HI> or <HI>Libel</HI> exhibit against them; <HI>as such</HI> they were punish'd,
for nothing else was express'd in the Sentence of the Magi∣strates.</P>
<P>Nothing of Malice, no Party, Church, or Clergy-Pique could come in∣to
it; the Magistrates treated them with all possible Tenderness, Chari∣ty
and Respect, forbore them till they were check'd by the Govern∣ment,
as if they had neglected the Safety of the Peace, and the Pre∣servation
of the Queen's Person; the Character of the Persons then and
now in the Magistracy of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Candour of their Pro∣ceedings
will admit no suspicion of Partiality, and their mild Usage
deserves a better Return, than the Narrative bestows.</P>
<P>For the Proof of this, the Reader is refer'd to the Body of this Work,
where he will find it made very plain, and every Article prov'd by Au∣thentick
Vouchers and Authorities, such as he will have no Reason to que∣stion
the Truth of; but if any doubt the Justness of the Copies, the Ori∣ginals
are left with the Publisher of this Work, for any that require it to
peruse and compare.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Postscript is taken up with Exclamations and
Ejaculations, in which this Tract is not concern'd, and which depend up∣on
the Substance of the Question in Debate, whether the Prosecution of
Jacobitism is the Persecution of Episcopacy, and this the other Part of
this Work, we hope, shall clear up.</P>

<PB N="1" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>The SCOTS NARRATIVE Examin'd, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter into the Particulars of this long Complaint,
and more narrowly examine the Narrative of the <HI>Jacobite
Clergy</HI> now before us; it is not improper to form some Prelimi∣naries,
which being abundantly granted in all the Parts of the Book we
are speaking to, will admit no Dispute, but may be laid down as Fun∣damentals
in the present Debate—And if they require any Testimo∣ny
to make them out, it will be sufficient to quote their own <HI>Narrative</HI>
for the Proof.</P>
<P>1. That the Prosecution of the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which
all this Complaint is made, is a Prosecution from the Civil Magi∣strate
only—That there is no Procedure against them
from the Church, <HI>that is to say,</HI> by any Ecclesiastical Process, or
Church Judicatory, such as <HI>Session, Presbytery, Synod,</HI> or <HI>General
Assembly,</HI> which are the only Judicial Powers in the Church of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>This is proved by the Narrative it self, <HI>pag.</HI> 5. where they complain
of the Irregularity of the Proceedings—Because, <HI>the Com∣plaint
is not moved by the Presbytery of the Bounds,</HI> as they say the
Law requires—And the Narrative complains, <HI>that this was
pleaded</HI> to the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates, but not allow'd.</P>
<P>2. That this Prosecution of the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is upon
no Point of their Profession or Opinion as <HI>Episcopal,</HI> upon no Reli∣gious
Dispute, such as relates to Doctrine or Worship—But purely
upon this short Question—<HI>Whether they shall be allow'd to keep open
Meeting-Houses, and Exercise their Ministry among the QƲEEN's
Subjects, without acknowledging the QƲEEN's Authority?</HI></P>
<P>This is plainly proved, from the same Book we are answering,
<HI>Pag. 6. When People are libell'd on an Act of Parliament, which is li∣mited
to one Person, and without any Word in that Act, that can ex∣tend
to others,</HI> AS FOR EXAMPLE; The Libel charges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
That they are <HI>Guilty of the Breach of the Law, which requires that
Prayers be made for King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>because they pray
not for Queen</HI> ANNE: Again, the <HI>Narrative</HI> pleads in their be∣half,
<HI>pag.</HI> 13. That they are of <HI>Peaceable Principles, and quiet De∣portment;</HI>
that in their Prayers, <HI>they are very careful to avoid giving
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
Offince,</HI> for <HI>they use such Comprehensive Forms, as are sufficient to pre∣vent
all suspicion of Disrespect,</HI> such as praying for THE SOVE∣REIGN,
<HI>for</HI> THE <HI>Royal Family; for all Christian Kings, Princes, and
Governours, for all our Rulers, &amp;c.</HI> and thus in <HI>pag. 10. We cannot
Dissemble nor Contradict our known Principles as others, who as Interest
moves, can Address, and make professions of Loyalty and Duty to the most
opposite and inconsistent Pretensions; who can disown a Prince in Misfor∣tune,
whose Title they once solemnly Vouched, and can Vouch the Title
of another in prosperous Circumstances, whose Right they will as readily
controvert,</HI>—&amp;c.</P>
<P>If these are not sufficient to prove, what we have laid down as above,
the whole Proceedings as Narrated in their own Book will confirm it.</P>
<P>It will also appear very necessary, to make these Things clear in the
Beginning—For several Reasons;</P>
<P>1. Because it is observable, those Gentlemen who are loudest in the
Complaint of Persecution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are forwardest to blend the
Church and the State together in this Affair; they are exceeding
loth, to have the Chiming Words, <HI>Persecution</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> se∣parated—And
what they have Joyned, they would have no Man
put asunder.</P>
<P>2. It is absolutely necessary to the right understanding of an Accusa∣tion
of Persecution, that we determine who are the <HI>Persecutors,</HI> and
who the <HI>Persecuted;</HI> how else can we ever arrive at the Charge, or
enter into a proper Defence?</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Presbyterians, Qua.Presbyterians,</HI> are not concern'd in this
Affair, we shall have the less to say about them; if we find them accu∣sed,
it is time to Answer for them, when we see the Charge; at present
the Narrative has done them that Justice, as to acknowledge, That the
Church-Judicatories <HI>did not concur</HI> in the Affair, <HI>neither by themselves, or
by any one having their Mandat</HI> or Authority. <HI>Narrative, pag.</HI> 6.</P>
<P>It remains then to enter into the short Question; Who are the <HI>Perse∣cutors,</HI>
and who the <HI>Persecuted?</HI> We begin with the latter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The persecuted,</HI> and those are the <HI>Jacobite Clergy,</HI> or in <HI>Southern</HI> Eng∣glish,
the <HI>Non-Jurant Clergy</HI> and their Hearers; whether they are
<HI>Episcopal</HI> or otherwise, is not the Question; nor are they enquir'd
after as to their Ordination, Profession, or Practice; save only as
<HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> some read the <HI>English Service,</HI> some read none; some
pray by Book, some without Book; but all are <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> as to
the QUEEN, refuse to acknowledge the Government, and as
such they are now consider'd; if any others have been questioned,
we may examine their Cases apart, and the Reasons why they are
involved in the same Sentence.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
2. <HI>The Persecutors,</HI> are the Civil Magistrates, such as the Provost, and
Bailiffs of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> the Sheriffs of Counties, Bayliffs of Burghs,
Stuarts of Stuartries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this by the express Com∣mand
and Direction of the Sovereign, and the Administration; or
in English <HI>the QƲEEN and Council.</HI></P>
<P>We need not Notice here the Reasons, that made this Prosecution par∣ticularly
necessary at this Time; such as the unsufferable Insults offer'd
to the Government, by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party at Home; of which we might
give a long History, or the impending Storm of an Invasion from the
Pretender Abroad; their Publickly owning the Pretender for their Law∣ful
Sovereign, who was at that time preparing a <HI>French</HI> Power to De∣pose
the QUEEN, and Overturn the Government—These things,
tho' of sufficient Weight in themselves, and which would, if Arguments
of another Nature were not in the Case, be allow'd able to justify the
Government, we however omit here; they will often occur in the Process
of the Story; but having laid down the two Preliminaries above, we
shall put the Weight of the present Discourse upon Four Enquiries.—</P>
<P>1. Whether it ought to be expected, that any sort of People should be
Tolerated, or Dispensed with by the Government, who will not
acknowledge the Government?</P>
<P>And here we shall find it necessary to explain the Terms, what we
mean by being <HI>Tolerated</HI> and <HI>Dispensed with</HI>—And what
we mean by <HI>Acknowledging the Government</HI>—The present Case
being a little particular in them all.</P>
<P>2. Whether the QUEEN has not had sufficient justifyable Reasons,
both before GOD and Man, for ordering the shutting up of the
Meeting-Houses in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for Prosecution of the Ministers?</P>
<P>And here it may be convenient to Examine, what we mean by
justifyable Reasons in a QUEEN, what by shutting up the Meet∣ing-Houses,
and what by Prosecuting the Ministers.</P>
<P>3. Whether the Magistrates in <HI>Scotland</HI> have done any thing illegally,
officously, or any thing less or more than their Duty, in the Prose∣cution
of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>4. Whether the Behaviour of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> has not justly
brought this upon themselves, and forc'd the Government to this
Proceeding with them?</P>
<P>The going thro' these Particulars, may perhaps be a full Answer to
most of the Heads of Complaint in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> which will
come in the way.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant, that two Things are suggested in Bar of what
is now laid down, tho' it does not appear, that either of them has been
prov'd, nor any sufficient Ground given for the Suggestion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"/>
1. That tho' the Magistrates or Government are the Prosecutors, yet
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church are the Persecutors; these are the Incendi∣aries,
the Informers, and the like—The other Party would think
it very hard, and that we should be very low in our Charity, <HI>and
they would have some Reason,</HI> if we should turn the Tables upon them,
<HI>and say,</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were indeed the Invaders, and the Pretender's
Name and Interest the outward Part of the Force invading—But
the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Gentry, and the Keepers up of
Meeting-Houses in <HI>Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> were the Incendiaries who gave
Encouragement to the Invasion it self, and were the Inviters of the
Pretender to disturb the publick Repose—Now as this is not a
just Way of drawing Consequences, because it carries with it no Evi∣dence;
so we would advise them not to legitimate the Practice by
their own Example, lest it return upon them too strongly.</P>
<P>2. That there are Meeting-Houses shut up, and Ministers prosecuted,
who have qualified themselves according to Law, and that there∣fore
the Charge of Jacobitism is but a Pretence. Reserving a more
full Answer to this by examining Matter of Fact; we shall only ob∣serve
for the present, that Jacobitism was the only moving Cause of
setting up Meeting-Houses, as has been sufficiently prov'd in the
World already; and Jacobitism has been the only moving Cause of
shutting them up again; and this was manifest in the very Prosecutions
in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where several, whose Conversation was inoffensive, tho'
they were not qualified, had their Meetings left open; and when all
the rest of the Meetings in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were clos'd, these preach'd un∣disturb'd,
<HI>and do so still</HI>—If others, tho' qualify'd, had not the same
Treatment, these Gentlemen ought not to bring it in as an Argu∣ment
in this Case; because it forces us say, what we do not desire to
make publick, and puts us to a Necessity of exposing the Gentlemens
Reputation, and discovering the Crimes for which they had other
Treatment, <HI>Viz.</HI> Being legally depos'd from being Ministers.</P>
<P>Now, tho' by the present Constitution of the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they do
not find themselves under any Obligation to forbear, even those that
are qualified by taking the Oaths, who dissent from the Church—Nor
indeed can the Government of <HI>Britain by the Ʋnion</HI> license Men
to erect Meeting-Houses, tho' they did qualifie; yet there has al∣ways
been an Inclination of Tenderness both in the Church and in the
Government; and there is no question, but on a quiet and peaceable
Behaviour, they, who give reasonable Assurances to the Government
of their Fidelity to, and Acknowledgment of the QUEEN, would
find Forbearance, and always have found it: Therefore if any, who
have thus qualified, are at present Sufferers among the rest, tho' we
do not grant it, they suffer by being found in bad Company—And
may in a due Submission to Authority, no question, find as much Fa∣vour,
as their Behaviour can pretend to deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
But to return to our general Heads; We are now to examine,</P>
<P>(1.) Whether it ought to be expected, that any sort of People should be
Tolerated, or Dispensed with by the Government, who will not acknow∣ledge
the Government?</P>
<P>And here we need not examin Antient-History, or the Custom of Foreign
Nations but rather put it upon these Gentlemen to tell us, at what Time,
or in what Country, any <HI>Dissenters</HI> have been or are allow'd to enjoy
Liberty, without taking such Oaths, or giving such Assurances of their
Fidelity and Submission to the Government, as by the Laws and Customs
of that Country their Subjects were requir'd to give?—And here we
are willing to joyn with the <HI>Narrative, p.</HI> 16. in their <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Prote∣stant
Churches abroad.</P>
<P>In the next Place let them take the present Circumstances of <HI>Britain,</HI>
as it now stands under a Government, claim'd by a Pretender abroad,
and that Pretender <HI>not only</HI> cloath'd with the Titles and Honours of
the Sovereign, and back'd with the Power of a potent Enemy, who pre∣tends
to acknowledge him as Sovereign; <HI>but also</HI> acknowledg'd, pray'd
for, and his Pretensions to the Crown defended, by the very People we
are now speaking of, and who claim to be look'd upon as peaceable Sub∣jects,
in whom the Government is safe.</P>
<P>It would be needless to enter into Examinations and Reflections on
particular Actions of Men; but since the Narrative pretends that the
Government is safe in these People, <HI>that they live under the present Go∣vernment
peaceably, quietly and inoffensively, Narrat. p.</HI> 19. And that to
represent them as dangerous to the Government, is to use them as the
<HI>Pagans did the Christian Martyrs of Old, wrap them up in the Skins of Beasts,
that the Lyons that were let loose upon them, might destroy up with the more
Violence, p.</HI> 18. We are oblig'd to speak something of their Behaviour,
which we had rather have let fall, as not being forward to expose
them.</P>
<P>Not at all therefore to wrap them in any Dress but their own, neither
to misrepresent, nor so much as aggravate their Actions in particular, or
the Behaviour of their Party in general; let us but state the Case between
the Church-Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> and these People, and the Govern∣ment
of <HI>Britain</HI> and these People.</P>
<P>As to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is apparent, and even the <HI>Narrative,</HI>
tho' written with more Temper than the Writings of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Party
use to be written with, <HI>discovers it</HI>—They treat them without the com∣mon
Charity due to Christians, even while the other return to them as
much Forbearance, as they are able to shew with Safety to their Estab∣lishment,
bearing their Intrusions into their Churches, their Mobbings
and Rabling of their Ministers, and at the same time, contributing in
Charity to their Necessities—Yet even in this very <HI>Narrative,</HI> they
upbraid them <HI>with being declared Enemies to all Power that will not support
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
them,</HI> and kicking <HI>against all Authority that does not favour them,</HI> and all
along shew their Inveteracy at the <HI>Fresbyterians,</HI> by disowning them as
Gospel-Ministers, and reproaching their Principles, on account of the
opposition they formerly made, to the intollerable, illegal Oppressions
of a Tyranny, tho' the same the whole Nation was afterwards oblig'd
to cast off, <HI>pag.</HI> 14.—Nor does it seem reasonable to brand the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with taking up Arms at <HI>Pentland</HI> or <HI>Bothwel,</HI> a∣gainst
the same Tyranny and Barbarity, which being against all Law
and Reason, and lying so heavy on that poor People, as that Human
Nature could no longer bear it; they only too rashly, and with TOO
WEAK a Force, opposed that, which afterwards the whole Island
kick'd off as intollerable, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms condemn'd,
as Illegal.</P>
<P>Nor should the <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> call the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> Rebels in this Case,
till they give some farther Assurance to the Government, that they them∣selves,
under far less Oppressions, are not of the same Principles—And
let any Man that thinks this uncharitable, only refer to the Con∣duct
of the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when the Pretender was upon the
Coast, their Joy when they expected his Landing, the Threats and In∣sults
of their Party upon the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and how they had mark'd
out the very Habitations of particular Persons to be Rabbled and Plun∣der'd,
(perhaps worse)—And how the People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> began
to talk of seeking to the <HI>French, if they had landed,</HI> for Protection from
the Barbarities of their own Episcopal Rabbles; add to this the Chagrin
and Dejection of the whole Party, at the Defeat of a <HI>French</HI> Power,
and at the Disappointment they were under, of not making good, what
they have commonly preach'd in their Meeting-Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
had rather be under <HI>Popery</HI> than <HI>Presbytery.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>As to the Government,</HI> we forbear to enter into the particular Be∣haviour
of Persons, being not willing to treat them with Invectives;
but while they make their Peaceable Behaviour an Argument, why the
present Government ought to think it self safe it them; it obliges us in
behalf of the Government, a little to examine their Behaviour, in
order to make the Governments Proceeding with them appear, as it
really is, both Necessary and Equitable.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> We are to remember, That with Force and Arms they
stood out against this Government, and against the Revolution, as
long as their Power was able to resist; That they were not subdued but
by the Sword, after they had fought the Forces of the Government at
<HI>Gilli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rankie,</HI> at <HI>Dunkeld,</HI> and in defending the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and
having obtain'd the Victory at the first of these, gave us all sufficient
occasion to know what they proposed, had not their General, the Vis∣count
of <HI>Dundee,</HI> been slain in the Action, <HI>viz.</HI> Restoring Episcopacy with
the Tyranny and Cruelty of the former Reigns, under a <HI>Popish</HI> and spu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious
Race.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16"/>
Being thus reduc'd by the Sword, and Conquer'd, not having submit∣ted;
it seems something Assuming, to tell us now of their <HI>peaceable Beha∣viour,</HI>
and the <HI>Safety of the Government,</HI> in giving them <HI>a full Liberty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2. Next it seems proper to enquire, What it is they seek a Liberty for.
The Narrative alledges, That it is merely in Matter of Religious Offices,
and complains of it, as</HI> a great Grievance and Mise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, that the performing
of publick Offices of Religion should be clogg'd with Terms relating to State-Differences;
and that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are God's Especial Servants, should be
obliged to enter into the Decision of publick Controversi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. <HI>Narr.</HI> p 18. <HI>Par.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>But let any Impartial People consider, Whether this Argument does
not turn directly upon them—That the Clergy, who by the Especial
Command of God in the Scripture, are commanded to be <HI>subject to the higher
Powers,</HI> which plainly infers obeying the Laws of the Land, and who are
commanded to pray for <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>All in Authority;</HI> should <HI>of themselves</HI>
enter into the <HI>Decision of State-Controversies, such as</HI> disputing the Titles
of their Governours, refusing to pray for them, tho' the Laws of
the Land have vested them with Supreme Authority—That these
Men should <HI>take upon them to</HI> enter into the <HI>Decision of this State Contro∣versy;</HI>
how far the meaning of a Law, obliging Ecclesiastick Persons to
pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> NOMINATIM was design'd
to extend as to their Successors—And into <HI>this State-Controversie,</HI> how
far an Act, Ordaining Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pray for the present Queen, was
or was not extended; presuming to construe it their own way, so
as to mean only such as were Benefi'cd Ministers, and the like; so that
'tis evident, these Gentlemen at the same time that they complain of it
as <HI>a Misery and a Grievance, that they should be obliged to enter into State-Controversies,</HI>
do Voluntarily, and without Authority, make themselves
Judges in State Controversies, take upon them to explain the Laws in
their own Favour, and then complain, that the Government is not plea∣sed
to accept of their Explanation, and to take the Laws in their Sense;
for which very thing one of the prime Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> was Sentenc'd
to the Scaffold, under the mild Dispensation of their own Episcopal Go∣vernours.</P>
<P>This
therefore is the Case, and the Narrative in that particular is not
Just to the Matter of Fact—Their Ministers do voluntarily take
upon them to decide the State-Controversie of the Queen's Title to the
Crown; They refuse to recognize Her Majesty's Authority, or pray
for her as Sovereign; and at the same time say, 'tis hard they should be
put to enter into these State-Controversies; whereas, on the other hand,
speaking of them as Subjects, it rather seems hard they should be suffe'd
to enter into such Controversies, as dispute the Title of their Sovereign,
much less be suffer'd openly and avowedly, to acknowledge and pray for
a pretending Invader.</P>
<P>It cannot but be taken Notice of also, how Politickly the Narrative
insinuates; That this Prosecution seems Pointed at the <HI>English Service,
being introduc'd in</HI> Scotland, <HI>pag. 1. The chief occasion of this disturbance,
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
was the acceptance that the Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England <HI>met with in</HI> Scot∣land,
<HI>pag.</HI> 15. But as this is not true in Fact, so neither is the Pretence Just;
since the Entertainment the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy finds in <HI>Scotland,</HI> even among
the Episcopal People themselves, is so little, and the thing it self so much
a Novelty to them, as being never practis'd, even in their own Episc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pal
Days of Liberty; that it is not capable of giving themselves any
Encouragement, or the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> the least Uneasiness; but of
this by it self.</P>
<P>To this Behaviour of the Episcopal Party, might be subjoyn'd their
general profess'd opposition to the Protestant Succession in the Union
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and their open desiring and pleading for a Union with <HI>France,</HI>
which can fairly be fix'd upon them; which being consider'd, we refer
it to the Judgment of all Impartial People; whether the Government at
the same time, that an Invasion of a <HI>French</HI> Power, and a <HI>Frenchyfied</HI> Preten∣der
was at the Door, in order to depose our Queen, destroy the Succes∣sion,
and dissolve the Union, had not just Reason to enquire, who was
with, and who against it; and to require all its Subjects to renew their
Assurances of Fidelity.</P>
<P>Thus far as to the Behaviour of the Episcopal Party in General; We
shall enquire of the Behaviour of the Persons in particular, in another
Part of this Tract.—</P>
<P>☞ <HI>NOTE,</HI> This Discourse will explain what we mean, by being
dispensed with, Tolerated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz. That the Government having a
Party among them profest Enemies to the Sovereign, not reduc'd to
Obedience but BY BLOOD and Conquest, should dispense with their
Allegiance, suffer them unmolested without taking the Oaths; let the
People be encourag'd by Disaffection, by learning them in their Publick
Devotions, to pray for the Invaders of the Settlement, and treat the
QUEEN as an unnatural Ʋsurper.</P>
<P>2. One would think, this were sufficient to justify Her Majesty, in
shutting up the Meeting Houses in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and prosecuting the Mini∣sters—
But lest it should seem to be only too general, we must de∣scend
here to the particular Reasons which Her Majesty had for this
Proceeding. And,</P>
<P>1. <HI>This may pass for one;</HI> That such was the height of Disaffection,
which the People who were the Supporters of these Ministers
were come to, by the Indulgence and Forbearance of the
Government, that even the <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Ministers themselves
were not hot and intemperate enough for them; but if any
of them seem'd enclin'd to acknowledge the Government, or pray
for the Queen, <HI>in Testimony of their Peaceable Disposition,</HI> they would
not hear them; and this several of the said Ministers declared to
the Lord Provost of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> upon their Examination, and that
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
being Peaceably disposed, as it is hoped many of them are; they
were enclin'd to do their Duty, but that such was the Temper of
their Hearers, that if any of them had done so, they would have
been rejected by the Party as <HI>Apostates,</HI> and not supported in their
Ministerial Employments.</P>
<P>Either this <HI>is true</HI> or it <HI>is false;</HI> For the Truth of it we freely appeal,
<HI>First</HI> to the very Ministers themselves, believing; since 'tis no Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge
any one can be prosecuted for, they are too honest to deny it—And
next to the late Lord Provost and Magistrates, to whom it was acknow∣ledg'd—And
<HI>if this be true,</HI> we leave it to the Judgment of all the Pro∣testant
Churches abroad, to whom the Narrative <HI>seems willing to refer it
also, pag.</HI> 16, whether it be reasonable such a Party of People should be
born with, <HI>much less Tolerated and Protected by the Government;</HI> whether
any Government now in <HI>Europe</HI> suffers any of their Subjects to enjoy
such a Liberty <HI>on such T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms;</HI> and whether any Protestant Church in
<HI>Europe</HI> behave themselves in such a manner to the Government they
live under?</P>
<P>2. Nay such is the aversion among the Party, who are the support of
these Ministers, to the least acknowledgment, or expression of
Duty to the Queen, that we are inform'd, and have great Reason
to believe it—That in the Distribution of the Charity collected
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Relief of the Episcopal Clergy
and their Distress'd Families, tho' that Charity was encourag'd by
the QUEEN her self, is chiefly bestow'd by <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and by such as acknowledge the QUEEN in both Nations,
and ought to be distributed <HI>at least without such a Distinction</HI> to
all that were Necessitous; yet if any have been Peaceably enclin'd,
and have either quallifyed themselves by taking the Oaths, or shown
but their general good intention by praying for the Queen by
Name; they have thought fit to distinguish them, by striking them
out of their Roll, and refusing them any share in the Relief; and 'tis
hoped the Ministers concern'd will not put us to the Proof of this,
lest something worse happen to appear with it—</P>
<P>3. The former Reasons proceed from the People supporting the Mini∣nisters;
Let us next examine a little, what may relate to the Ministers
themselves, in which we shall be as tender as possible; we have indeed
much said in the <HI>Narrative</HI> of their Peaceable Disposition, their inoffensive
Behaviour, and how safe the Government is in them—But we cannot but
ask any considering Person, to weigh the Thing taken complexly: For <HI>be
it so,</HI> that the behaviour of the Ministers was Peaceable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to their pri∣vate
Conversation—Yet can any Body say, the Government is safe in them,
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
who keep up open Assemblies of conquer'd Enemies; for such their Party are,
who first having fought in the Field against the present Settlement to the
Effusion of a great deal of Blood, and own'd their Designs of restoring
Tyranny Sword in Hand—Now by way of Faction and Party, openly
to avow <HI>Jacobite Principles,</HI> disown the Government, and in their <HI>Meet∣ing-Houses</HI>
and <HI>Religious Worship,</HI> with their Spiritual Weapons, <HI>the Carnal
ones foiling,</HI> carry on the same War, and continue to fight against the
QUEEN<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Authority—Will any fine Words cover this Fraud? will
any one say, that praying for the QUEEN's Enemies is a Peaceable Prin∣ciple,
and refusing to pray for the Lawful Sovereign, an inoffensive Be∣haviour?</P>
<P>4.
This Practice is an Active Offence to the Government, and in its
Nature dangerous, since it is a nourishing and keeping up a Faction a∣gainst
the Government, and instructing the People in Principles pernicious
to the safety of the Present Government—Conveying to Posterity
the Poison of Disaffection, and preserving a Succession to <HI>Jacobite Princi∣ples;</HI>
and will they say the Government is safe in this, or that any Go∣vernment,
that had their Eyes open to their own Interest, would suffer
it?—Suppose they think these Principles just—Yet when they are
speaking to perswade the Government to for bear them, they must speak
to the Interest and Security of the Government; can any Government
be safe in the encreasing and promoting the Interest of those that will
not acknowledge that Government? Can the QUEEN think her self
safe in the encreasing the number of her profest Enemies? Can Her Ma∣jesty
justify it to her own Peace, and the Nations Satisfaction, to pro∣tect
those that disown her, and think her self safe in those that did fight
against her; and when they can do that no longer by the Sword, conti∣nue
to do it by all the Weapons they have left?—That pray against
her, and instruct Posterity to pray against her, and put forth their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣most
to encrease the number of those that pray against her, that if pos∣sible
they may in time become strong enough again, to take up the Sword
and fight against her as they did before?</P>
<P>If it be objected, this relates still to the People, not the Ministers:
We answer, it relates especially to the Ministers, who being their In∣structors,
both in Doctrine and Example, are particularly Instrumental,
in keeping up, encouraging and maintaining Principles prefectly inconsi∣stent
with the safety of the Government among their Hearers.</P>
<P>2. The equivocal manner of praying, seems to be a most unanswe∣rable
Charge upon the Ministers in Person, who appear guilty of preva∣ric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
either with GOD or Man, or with both; in putting up
Words in the solemn Duty of Prayer, and the Worship of GOD, which
either are equivocal in their Design, or may be taken so by their People,
<HI>and which they themselves make use of equivocally upon occasion;</HI> it lyes at their
Door to defend the Morality of it, particularly since they manifestly
offer them up to GOD in one Sence, and pleaded them before the Ma∣gistrates
in another—For <HI>Example,</HI> praying for THE QUEEN, either
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
when they offered these Words to the Magistrates, it was to excuse them∣selves,
and signify, that the Words were capable of being understood
of QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> or it was not; <HI>if it was not,</HI> they would find
it difficult to say, to what End they mentioned them; <HI>if it was,</HI> it is
apparent, they equivocated with the Magistrates in that Plea, or equi∣vocated
with GOD Almighty in their Prayers; nor would one of them,
(which shewed them Men of some Honesty), venture to say upon their Ve∣racity,
that they in their Prayers meant, or supposed themselves to be
understood by their Hearers, to mean QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> whom had
they declin'd to name, they might easily have distinguish'd by the
Words, PROTESTANT QUEEN; so that this Equivocation
was a just Aggravation of the Crime, and plainly reflects on the Morals
of the Ministers.</P>
<P>3. If it be the Misfortune of some Ministers, whose Temper may be
otherwise peaceable and inoffensive, to fall into this Error, the Govern∣ment
cannot help it, and we are sorry for it—But to say their Beha∣viour
is peaceable and inoffensive, who act in all the Ways their Circum∣stances
have left them, against the Queen and the Government, is to say
nothing, nor can it plead for any For bearance to them. <HI>For Example,</HI>
The poor, honest, innocent People of <HI>France,</HI> the Merchants and Paisants
of the remote Countries, their Behaviour to us is innocent and inoffen∣sive;
yet as they are in the Cause of the <HI>French</HI> Power, and there by are Ene∣mies
to the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> we land upon them, plunder them, bombard
them, take their Ships, and imprison their Seamen—And 'tis very just to
do so, <HI>for they are professed Enemies,</HI> they support the Grand Enemy, they
assist against us in their Degree, and to the utmost, tho' otherwise they
mean no ill—<HI>The Jacobite Party,</HI> (and Ministers especially) they assist
against the Peace of the present Establishment, with all their possible En∣deavours,
they encourage the Party in di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owning the Goverment, refuse
to pray for the Sovereign, and thus all their peaceable Disposition ends
in this, that in short they oppose the Government in every thing they
can—Their Power was broke by Force, otherwise they had continued
to oppose us with Arms, and 'tis owing to our Victory over them, that
they are not in actual Rebellion at this Day; with what Weapons they
have, they fight us still, <HI>Viz.</HI> Their Tongues to Men, and their Prayers
to God; and after all this, the Narrative would fain perswade us, that
the Government is safe in these Men, that they are of a peaceable Dispo∣sition,
and an inoffensive Behaviour.</P>
<P>This, we think, answers what is premis'd in the second Query, <HI>viz.</HI>
What we mean by justifiable Reasons in the the Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a few
Words—“That her Majesty is necessitated by their Principles and
Behaviour to interpose her Power for the publick Safety, to suppress
this Party, and to prevent the Encrease of their Numbers by checking
their Assemblies, and obliging their Ministers, either to give bette
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
Assurances of their peaceable Principles, or for bear poisoning the Peo∣ple
by their Instructions and Example”</P>
<P>If as an Accident to this Necessity, the Worship of God <HI>in their Way</HI> is
interrupted to any, who are sincerely scrupulous of the Establish'd Way,
and tenacious of the Episcopal Rites; any Body that knows the Queen,
and knows her Majesty's Pious Intentions, her own Religious Profession
of the Protestant Religion in an Episcopal Church, her Zeal for her own
Opinion, her Charity for all conscientious People, tho' differing in Opi∣nion
from her self, and her Majesty's general Tenderness for all her Sub∣jects
without Exception, must clear the Queen of the Reproach, these
People would throw upon her of persecuting Episcopacy—Since what∣ever
Profession these People make, and whatever Liberty they have had,
has met with no other Interruption in the whole Reign of her Majesty,
than what for the foregoing Reasons has been absolutely necessary for the
Safety and Peace of the Goverment.</P>
<P>Not whatever have been the Pretences of some People, and whatever
the Narrative it self may aleadge; Has any Minister been silenc'd, or any
Meeting-House shut up, <HI>other than as here after is express'd,</HI> but such as where
the Minister officiating has been known to disown the Government, or re∣fuse
praying for the Queen, as will more particularly appear by the whole
judical Process Defences and Sentences pass'd in this Case in the City of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> annex'd to this Work. It seems therefore some Reflection
upon she Veracity of the Narrative, and upon the Reputation of its Au∣thor,
to say, That the not qualifying was only a Pretence, and that those
that did qualifie, were equally prosecuted with those that did not: The
contrary to which is manifest, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>But above all, the Injustice of this <HI>Narrative,</HI> and its Reflection upon
Her Majesty, will appear in examining an Insinuation, which upon second
View will appear to have no manner of Foundation, other than
in the Policy of the Author, who might think perhaps to make his Ar∣gument
popular in <HI>England</HI> by such an <HI>Introduction</HI>—And this is in
the very first Paragraph, where he says, <HI>The Prosecution being begun just
before</HI> Easter, <HI>it was obvious, the Design was to hinder or disturb the Peo∣ples
Devotions, which they were wont to practice at that time;</HI> and particu∣larly
it says, <HI>a Citation was given to some who used the English Form of Ser∣vice
in their Chappel.</HI> Pag. 1.</P>
<P>Again, in another Place; <HI>The chief occasion of this disturbance, was the accep∣tance
that Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England <HI>meets with in</HI> Scotland, <HI>so as it
is come publickly to be practised, and People resort to those Occasions with much
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>delight, both at</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>and at many other Placesin the Country.</HI> Narrat <HI>pag</HI> 15</P>
<P>This is a Discovery of a Politick in the Author unhappily clashing,
<HI>First</HI> with Charity; <HI>Secondly</HI> with Truth; And, <HI>Thirdly</HI> with it self.</P>
<P>With the <HI>First,</HI> to alledge that this Prosecution is not for the Safety
of the Government, but purely to suppress the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> in which
the Author Mal-treats the QUEEN and the whole Ministry, who are
known to be eminently Zealous for, and firm in the Profession of the
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
Protestant Religion in an <HI>Episeopal Church,</HI> and by whom, and by whose
especial Order these Prosecutions, and all the Proceedings thereupon,
<HI>being impartially represented to them,</HI> were justifyed and approved by the
QUEEN and Council, and the Magistrates in all Places in <HI>Scotland,</HI> orde∣red
to proceed farther, to the effectual suppressing these Assemblies, as
Dangerous to the Government, and destructive to the Publick Peace, as
may be seen by Her Majesty's Letter to the Lord Advocate of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
Dated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Counter-Sign'd by the Right Honourable
the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Principal Secretary of State.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We must take leave to observe, that in this the <HI>Narrative</HI>
clashes with the Truth of Fact, and a little with it self; for that it
says the Citation was <HI>given to some who used the English Service in their Chap∣pels.</HI>
Narrat. <HI>p.</HI> 1. This any Body will allow a Reader to understand to
mean, <HI>to such only,</HI> or else it would seem to be spoken with no Significa∣tion
at all.</P>
<P>Now the Fact here is very plain, the Prosecution was not Special a∣gainst
those that did, or did not use the <HI>English</HI> Service, but against
those that did or did not take the Oath of Allegiance, and Sign the same
with the Assurance, and pray for the Queen as the Law directs; and
the first Libel, the very same which follow'd the Citations, was a∣gainst
seventeen Ministers in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> one fourth Part of
whom did not use the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> and this the <HI>Narrative</HI> acknow∣ledges,
<HI>pag.</HI> 25, and 26, where in an <HI>Appendix,</HI> it gives the Copy of the
Libel, and the Names of 17 or 18 Ministers who are prosecuted in it;
and therefore it seems this Suggestion of the Narrative, <HI>That only such
as used the</HI> English Liturgy <HI>were cited,</HI> does not consist with it self any
more than with the Truth of Fact.</P>
<Q><HI>And this brings us directly to the Third Enquiry,</HI> viz.
Whether the Magistrates in <HI>Scotland</HI> have done any thing illegally, offi∣cously,
or any thing less or more than their Duty, in the Prosecution
of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland?</HI></Q>
<P>This Enquiry is very needful in the present Case, and may serve to
give Light to some things, in which the <HI>Narrative, and indeed the whole
Episcopal Party</HI> before the writing this Book, and since also, very much
impose upon the World.</P>
<P>Particularly they would seem to insinuate, as before, (1) That this
Prosecution is the Act and Deed of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> abstra∣ctly,
consider'd, and not of the Government. (2.) That it is their Act and
Deed as <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and Pointed at the Church, meerly as <HI>Episcopal.</HI>
(3.) That it is their Act and Deed as <HI>Scots Presbyterians,</HI> and particularly
levell'd at the Church of <HI>England</HI> Service, which was just going to be
introduc'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23"/>
The first of these is effectually answere'd, by affirming <HI>what is most
ture, viz.</HI> That this whole Prosecution has been the meer Act of the Go∣vernment;
which Government being, as is noted, wholly <HI>Episcopal,</HI> it can∣not
be imagin'd without great Injustice, the QUEEN had any regard
in it but to the Publick Safety; and therefore, together with the former
Circumstances, it is evident, that nothing but the Necessity of Affairs,
the Danger of Foreign Invasions, and the growing forwardness of a
Party at Home, moved the Government to take this Course to preserve
itself.—Not that if these particular Circumstances had not now con∣curr'd,
the Government had been under any Obligation to protect
them, while they refused to comply with what the Law expected of
Faithful Subjects, of <HI>which-hereafter</HI>—But as to the Fact in hand, no∣thing
was done to restrain the Liberty they enjoy'd, till about the End
of <HI>February,</HI> 1708—The very time the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was expected every
Hour upon the Coast of <HI>Scotland;</HI> this the <HI>Narrative</HI> acknowledges, in the
very first Words of it—For it begins thus: <HI>In the Month of</HI> March, 1708.
<HI>after the Episcopal Ministers in the Meeting-Houses of this Place</HI> (Edinburgh)
<HI>had for several Years continued in the Exercise of their Ministry, they were
surpriz'd with the Notice of a Citation</HI>—It had been very just if they
had added, Occasioned by the alarm of an Invasion, intended to be made by
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> whom all or most part of these Ministers and their Hearers ac∣knowledg'd
for their Sovereign, prayed for, and gave the Government Reason
to apprehend they had encourag'd to make this attempt.</P>
<P>This Matter being cleared up, the Second and <HI>Third</HI> Suggestions, <HI>viz.</HI>
of this Prosecution being the Act of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> of <HI>Scotland
as such,</HI> against the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters as such,</HI> and aginst the <HI>Eng∣lish
Service,</HI> fall to the Ground together—For 'tis acknowledg'd
in the first Line of the <HI>Narrative,</HI> That they enjoy'd their Liberty
for several Years before, till <HI>March,</HI> 1708. (<HI>viz.</HI>) till the very Month
the Pretender appear'd upon the Coast—And if it was not time
for the Government to stir to take away all the hopes of such an
Attempt, and to abridge the Liberty of the Friends to that Interest,
let our Enemices themselves be Judges.</P>
<P>It might be observ'd indeed here, That the <HI>Episcopal People</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
endeavouring to introduce the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy into <HI>Scotland</HI> at this
time, had several things in it, which did not at all prove the Peacea∣ble
Disposition of the Party nor the Honesty of their Design; for with∣out
looking back to the Disturbances, which the like Attempt former∣ly
producd in that Nation, and the Aversion of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
such Novelties; it is apparent, it was not for any particular Respect to,
or Approbation of the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, that they attempted now to set it up
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> for it might then be ask'd, why they never made any attempt
to introduce it in <HI>Scotland</HI> for 28 Year, from the Restoration to the Re∣volution,
when they had so entirely subjected the People, that they could
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
impose almost any thing upon them—If then they had a true Zeal
for the <HI>English</HI> Service, they would not have failed to have brought it in
while they had the Power in thier hands—Nor is the delight of the
People in the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI> any less an absurdity than the other,
since they that know the History of the late Times, know niether King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. nor the Clergy ever durst make the Attempt to restore it, tho,
they had enclin'd to it, because they knew the People would not be brought
to it—How it should come to pass that <HI>Scotland</HI> is so changed, and that
the love of the <HI>Common- Prayer</HI> should be now so great, since the fall of
<HI>Episcopacy,</HI> would be strange; if we did not know that the Fact is not
really true, and that the whole Project is but to form a Division, and pos∣sess
the <HI>English Episcopal Church</HI> with Prejudices against the <HI>Scots</HI> on one
hand, as if Persecuting the <HI>Dissenters</HI> because of the Liturgy; and with
an Opinion of the <HI>Episcopal Scots</HI> on the other hand, as all one with them∣selves;
whereas it is evident, while they had the Government in their
own hands, they never regarded their Union with the <HI>English Church,</HI> nor
received or attempted to receive the <HI>English</HI> Service into their Churches.</P>
<P>Nor is it at all obliging to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the first appear∣ance
of entertaining the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> begins among the Enmies to
the <HI>English</HI> Church, for such the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> and their Hearers must be;
The present Establish'd Church of <HI>England</HI> being accounted Schismatical
by the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> here, and consequently by them.—-</P>
<P>Nor can this courting the Church of <HI>England</HI> here, be any thing but
a feint with design to make Divisions; since were these Men to be resto∣red
by the influence of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> they could not joyn with
one another, with any manner of consistency with their respective Prin∣ciples:
For Example, If the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> joyn'd with the
the Church of <HI>England;</HI> they must joyn with them in Persecuting and
Depriving all the <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> who are here Deposed
for the same thing, for which these Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> are Prosecuted;
they must own them justly turn'd out, and stand by and assist the Church
of <HI>England</HI> in doing it—And this would be inconsistent with them, as
being <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> themselves: If on the other hand the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
joyned with the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> we are speaking of in <HI>Scotland;</HI>
they must then set their hands to that Non-Jurant Principle in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which they themselves persecute in <HI>England;</HI> they must deny the Revo∣lution,
own themselves Rebels, and their Queen an Usurper—Thus
this introducing the Liturgy into <HI>Scotland,</HI> can have no Design to bring
the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to unite; <HI>for it is im∣possible,</HI>
it is not in Love to the Service; <HI>for then, why did they not show it,
when they had the Power in their hands?</HI> And it is not to oblige the People
of <HI>Scotland</HI> as desiring it, <HI>for it is certain they would never bear it,</HI> but it is
purely to form a Division.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> There is not a little Reason to doubt the Matter of Fact sug∣gested,
<HI>Narrat. p.</HI> 15. viz. <HI>The Acceptance the</HI> English <HI>Liturgy meets with;</HI>
since 'tis well known, their own People do not like it; several of their
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
own Ministers could never be perswaded to use it; <HI>no, not some of these
now under Persecution;</HI> and upon the introducing it into other of their
Meeting Houses, many of their Hearers went from them on that Occa∣sion,
and they cannot name Ten of their Meetings in the whole Kingdom
that can bring the People to make use of it now, after all the Attempts
made to reconcile them to it; neitherwill their Objection hold, that this is
a hindrance to Religion, and exposing the People to omitting Divine Wor∣ship;
for those that are meerly Episcopal in Judgment, and not concer∣ned
in these Politick Controversies, that is, are not <HI>Jacobites,</HI> either at∣tend
the Ministry of such Episcopal Ministers, as are now preaching in
the Church, <HI>and who are at least an eighth Part of the whole B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nefic'd Mini∣stry
of Scotland;</HI> or content themselves to hear the <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI>
preach, joyning in Communion with the other as they have occasion—Now
'tis obvious, not one of these Episcopal Ministers use the Liturgy
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or any other prescrib'd Forms, but take the
Oaths to the Government and are protected by it; but this eminent
Zeal for the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, for whih the Church of <HI>England</HI> is invited
to embrace these Men as Brethren, is only seen among the profess'd Ene∣mies
of the Queen and Government; the same the Church of <HI>England</HI>
has expunged and cast out, and not thought them fit to be allowed the
Exercise of their Ministerial Offices in the whole Kingdom, tho' other∣wise
as able, as well quallifyed, as duly ordain'd, and of Behavour as
Inoffensive, and as Peaceable as any of these Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> will
pretend to be.</P>
<P>We come now to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whose Part in the Ma∣nagemet
of this Matter, notwithstanding all the Clamour raised against
them, has been, 1. Legal, with respect to the Law, except only the Sin of
Lenity and Mitigation of the Rigour the Law would have justifyed.
2. Merciful in every Part, in which they could shew Mercy, with a due
regard to, and consistent with Justice and their Duty to their Soverign.
3. Charitable to the Persons of the Ministers, and to their Circumstan∣ces;
and this will lead us into a full <HI>Narrative,</HI> also of the Proceedings
from their Beginning; of which the <HI>Narrative</HI> we are speaking to is but
a part.</P>
<P>And first for the Legality of the Proceedings of the Magistrates, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
will be necessary to look back to the Beginning of their first citing
before them, the Dissenting Ministers who kept Meeting-Houses in
<HI>Edinburgh:</HI> And here it appears,</P>
<P>“That about the End of <HI>Feb.</HI> 170 7/8. Her Majesty by Her Royal Letter
to the Privy-Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave Notice of the intended Invasion,
back'd with a <HI>French</HI> Power design'd against <HI>Scotland;</HI> recommending to
them the security of the Kingdom, the Preservation of the Publick
Peace, and that they would use all possible Means to that Effect.”</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26"/>
“The Privy-Council taking this Affair into their Consideration, it
naturally occurr'd; That to discourage the Enemies of the Government
at Home, was <HI>among others,</HI> one of the best steps to prevent the mis∣chievous
Consequences of an Invasion from Abroad; and in order to
this, that it was reasonable to suppress the Publick Meetings of those,
who under pretence of Divine Worship, admitted such Ministers to
officiate, as the Law in that Case had prohibited, having not qualifyed
themselves by taking the Oaths, praying for the QUEEN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
by which the Publick Disaffection was upheld and encourag'd.”</P>
<P><HI>NOTE,</HI> Here is the Original of this Persecution, plainly trac'd
to the <HI>French</HI> Invasion, and the Danger of the State; not their being
Episcopal, but their being Jacobite; not their using the <HI>English</HI> Litur∣turgy,
but their not praying for the QUEEN, are the Reasons of their
first Disturbance—<HI>For till now,</HI> the <HI>Narrative</HI> owns they had
been for sevral Years unmolested. <HI>Narrat.</HI> pag. 1.</P>
<P>“It was then agreed to <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> in the Privy-Council;
<HI>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of the Coun∣cil
for Proof;</HI> That Orders should be Issued out to all inferiour Magi∣strates,
to put this Resolve in Execution; and Orders were according∣ly
Issued out to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for that Purpose, who
thereupon Legally called before them several Ministers or Preachers,
who were known to keep Publick Meeting-Houses within their Bounds—Asking
them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for
Her Majesty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> in their Publick Meeting-Houses; and
if they had quallifyed themselves by taking the Oath of Allegiance,
and subscribing the same with the Assurance, as the Law requir'd?”</P>
<P>“Some of them answer'd directly, but others avoiding the Question,
requir'd a Legal Trayl, by way of Libel and Proof; which was ac∣cordingly
Appointed, and whereof the precise Points were, <HI>for which,
me appeal, even to the Draught in the Narrative it self;</HI> their not taking
the Oath of Allegiance, and subscribing the same with the Assurance;
their not praying for Her Majesty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> as the Law re∣quires;
and their not observing Publick Fasts and Thanksgivings; all
which were Notour, and being Negatives proved themselves.”</P>
<P>And here the Reader is to take Notice, That the <HI>Narrative</HI> in its Account of
these Proceedings, gives very unfairly a large Account of the Defences of
the Ministers, but tells us <HI>the Magistrates repell'd all their Dilators and
Defences;</HI> and so immediately brings them in <HI>Discerning and Ordaining,</HI>
that is, giving Sentence, as if they had done it Arbitrarily, and without
any Form; but upon a fair relating of the Fast, it will appear, the Ma∣gistrates
with their <HI>Repelling,</HI> that is, <HI>Over-ruling</HI> their Defences,
gave fair and Legal Arguments and Reasons, such as could not by Law
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
be objected against, for their said <HI>Repelling</HI> and <HI>Over-ruling,</HI> as will
appear by this following Account of the whole Matter—Which we pre∣sent
to the World from the very Court where it was transacted, and have
it under the Hand of the proper Persons, who can give Authority to it,
and have reserved the Original for any one to see, that may question the
Exactuess of this Relation.</P>
<P>“To this Libel the foresaid Preachers made Answers, and also took a
Protest, That they were not legally cited, not being call'd either on fif∣teen
Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days as the late Act of
Parliament against Intruders prescribes.”</P>
<P>“To which it was answer'd, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and
perpetual Custom within Burgh had over-ruled it to 24 Hours; and as
to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Trail of Intruders.
But the Preachers call'd, being conven'd for notour Disaffection by
not praying, and by not taking the Oath of Allegiance, nor keeping
Fasts and Thanksgivings, the Citations were good, and the Procedure
unquestionable; and yet the Magistrates thought fit to give them a
farther Indulgence, and to allow them to give in all their Defences.”</P>
<P>“The Sum of which Defences, as contain'd in a Representation exhibit
by the said Preachers, being first the foresaid Dilators to this, they ad∣ded,
That by the Act of Parliament 1693, requiring all Ministers and
Preachers to take the Oath of Allegiance, It is provided, that the Con∣travener
shall be punish'd by Banishment, or otherways as the Privy-Council
should think fit, and therefore the Libel was improperly tabled
before the Magistrates.”</P>
<P>“It was answer'd, To the <HI>first</HI> Dilators, that the former Answers were
repeated; And to the <HI>second,</HI> That the Privy-Council having refer'd
the Execution to the Magistrates, there could be no more Debate about
their Competency on that Head.”</P>
<P>“But then the Preachers went on to object against the Relevancy. And
as to the Act of the Convention ordaining all Ministers to pray for the
King and Queen <HI>Nominatim,</HI> They answer'd, That that Act did die and
expire with King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> And as to the Act 1693,
ordaining all Preachers to take <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Oath of Allegiance, and sign the
same with the Assurance; They answer'd, <HI>First,</HI> That that Act did only
concern Ministers provided to Benefices and Stipends, and could not be
extended to such Preachers, as enjoy no Benefice under the Government;
And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Act recognizing Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> enjoyns
the Taking of the Oath of Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to such as are in publick
Trust, and Preachers not benefic'd cannot be said to be in any publick
Trust; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Act of Parliament 1693, limited to the Per∣sons
of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> is out of Doors with them.”</P>
<P>“To which it was reply'd, That the Act of Convention, ordaining all
Ministers and Preachers to pray for the King and Queen <HI>Nominatim,</HI> is
certainly to be understood, likeways of all their Royal Successors, spe∣cially
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
since it is so plainly founded upon the Command of the Apostle,
and the Duties of all Subjects. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Act 1693, expresly relates
to all Preachers, whether benefic'd or not, and withal defines all Prea∣chers
to be Persons in publick Trust; so that the Act recognizing Her
Majesty did exactly fall in within it, and affords no Releif to the De∣fenders.
And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Act 1693, tho' it mention King <HI>William</HI>
and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet is not limited to them, but being a perpetual Law,
extends to all their Royal Successors; likeas by the said Act recognizing
Her Majesty, it is <HI>de facto</HI> so extended.”</P>
<P>“Which Defences and Replies being read and consider'd by the Magi∣strates,
they repell'd the Dilators, as also all the other Defences pro∣poned
for the Defenders, and sound, that since they had not pray'd for
Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE, Nominatim,</HI> and taken the Oath of Allegi∣ance,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore ordain'd
them, and every one of them, to desist from keeping of any Meeting-Houses
within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Liberties thereof, and from
preaching or exercising any Part of the Ministerial Function within the
same in time coming, under the Pain of Imprisonment, and to find Cau∣tion
for that Effect betwixt and the <HI>30th</HI> Day of <HI>March</HI> then instant, and
in the mean time that their Meeting Houses be forthwith shut up. But
tho' this Sentence was then past, yet nothing follow'd upon it, until that
the Privy-Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> being determin'd by an Act of Parlia∣ment,
after the 1st of <HI>May,</HI> these disaffected Preachers judging, that the
Councils Orders were also expir'd with the Council that gave them,
did about the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> fall again to their Preaching, and enter'd
their Meeting-Houses. And farther they resolv'd among themselves, that
they would continue to preach and not desist; which mov'd the Magi∣strates
to renew the former Prohibition about the said <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last,
which they still neglecting and despising were again call'd before the
Magistrates about the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and requir'd to find Caution to de∣sist,
as being the known legal Execution upon such prohibitory Senten∣ces,
or otherwise to go to Prison. But they still refusing to obtemper,
the Magistrates thought fit on the <HI>13th</HI> to send Five only to Prison, which
Five were also at length reliev'd; so indulgent were the Magistrates in
this Matter.”</P>
<P>“This whole Trial, and all the Steps thereof, being transmitted
to Her Majesty, it pleas'd Her Majesty by her Royal Letters under Hand
and Seal of the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> last, to approve what was done by the
Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the said Matter, as acceptable Service; and
farder to judge it necessary for the Safety of her Royal Person and Go∣vernment,
that all such Meeting-Houses in every other Place should be
shut up.”</P>
<P>By this short Account of the Proceedings it will appear, whether the
Magistrates acted by true, fair and legal Methods, or no; and the long
Objections about the Illegality of the Process, and the Allowance of ten
Days in the Citation to answer, is effectually confuted.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29"/>
It may be noted here too, how unjust all the Pretensions of Illegality in
the Sentence are, as to ordaining them to forbear the Exercise of their
Ministerial Function within the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> for the Act of Parlia∣ment
enacting the Preachers not having Benefices to be punish'd by Banish∣ment,
or otherwise as the Privy-Council shall think fit—- And the Privy-Council
remitting their Authority to the Magistrates, <HI>'tis hard,</HI> the Magi∣strates
should be complain'd of for a Sentence which was <HI>lighter,</HI> than the
Law had empower'd them to inflict.</P>
<P>And this brings us to the second Head in the Magistrates Conduct, which,
we say, was in all the Parts of it MERCIFUL and CHARITABLE, to
the Extent of their Power; which appears in several Parts of their Prose∣cution.</P>
<P>1. That upon the first Libel, and the Sentence thereupon, notwith∣standing
the Sentence pronounc'd, and which oblig'd the Ministers
to find Caution or <HI>Bail</HI> to desist preaching or exercising any Part of
their Ministry within the Bounds of the City and Suburbs, yet the
Magistrates in Compassion to their Persons let them go free, without
insisting upon the said Bail, or sending for them again at the Time
appointed, except Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> who was committed for a particu∣lar
Affront to the Queen, when in Reading the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, he
purposely pass'd over the Prayers appointed for Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></P>
<P>2. That upon the first Citation the Magistrates distinguish'd of Men
also, and some, who tho' not qualify'd, yet being known to be Men
of more peaceable Dispositions, unconcern'd with publick Affairs,
praying for the Queen, and living quietly, were not summon'd or
cited at all, nor their Meeting-Houses shut up, such as Mr. . . <HI>Walker,</HI>
Mr: <HI>Johnston,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lumsdale;</HI> and that the Reasons and Fact may
be justify'd together, we have it to produce under the Hands of the
said Magistrates thus; That <HI>these three were not cited neither in</HI> March,
<HI>(which was the first Time) nor afterwards, because it was generally believ'd
they were good Men, and behav'd more peaceably than the rest; nor have
they been troubled since, tho' they were not qualify'd.</HI></P>
<P>3. That whereas upon the several Defences made before the Magi∣strates,
one of the Ministers alledg'd, that he had a numerous Fa∣mily,
and had no other way to subsist them; the Magistrates being
oblig'd to put the Law in Execution as to his Preaching, immediate∣ly
gave him a considerable Supply out of their own Purses for the
present Subsistence of his Family.</P>
<P>4. That when, as by the second Sentence appears, Five of the Ministers
were committed to the Tol Booth of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for refusing to <HI>find
Caution, &amp;c.</HI> and one of the said Ministers was taken ill in the Prison;
On the first Notice to the Magistrates of his Illness, they suffer'd him
to go home on his Parol, and soon after let all the rest be dismiss'd
without any farther Rigour, till they found them obstinate and in∣sulting.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="30"/>
These and several other Instances of the Mercy of the Magistrates
may be given, and serve sufficiently to clear them of acting any officious
forward Part, any farther than they were oblig'd to do as Magistrates
in the Discharge of their Duty, and for the Preservation of the Pub∣lick
Peace, according to Her Majesty's express Direction.</P>
<P>Nor even with the express Direction of the Government, did the
Magistrates appear forward, or act in it as Men fond of the Occasion,
but shew'd themselves very loth and backward to bring things to Extre∣meties,
had they not been forc'd to it the second Time, by the Con∣tempt
of their former Proceedings, in the Ministers entring their Meet∣ings
by Force, and resolving in a private Meeting of their own, that
they would not desist.</P>
<P>Nor even then did they proceed, till Her Majesty's Advocate by Ex∣press
Orders of the Government, the Privy-Council being then Dissol∣ved,
gave them fresh Notice, That it was Her Majesty's Pleasure, that
all manner of Disaffection to the Government should be suppress'd, and
the Encouragers thereof proceeded against according to Law, and In∣strumented
the Magistrates thereupon.</P>
<P>Take this in the very Words of one of the Principal Magistrates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whose Conduct the <HI>Narrative</HI> would fain blacken in this Affair,
which by the way seems but a very mean Requital for the Tenderness
his Lordship shewed for them.</P>
<P>“The Process tells plainly the Reason of the Prosecution, and that the
Magistrates had strict Ordersfrom the Council, for prosecuting all the
Ministers Preaching in Meeting-Houses, who did not quallify accor∣ding
to Law, by taking the Oaths, and praying for the Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
as the Law directs; as Persons there by keeping up a Sett of Peo∣ple,
who were Dangerous and Prejudicial to the Government,
both in Church and State, and not safe to be suffered—This <HI>Process</HI>
Commenced in <HI>March,</HI> and the Council would have had them sent
Prisoners from the Bar; but the Magistrates were tender of them,
and gave them above a Fortnight to find Surety—Nor at the End
of that Time were they call'd upon to perform it, we being willing
to make them easie—- But in return to this Civility, they
were so unkind, within about three Weeks, as to go to their
several Meeting-Houses, which the Magistrates had caused to be
padlock'd according to the Sentence, and to break them open
by force, in Desyance of the said Sentence, and the Authority of
the Magistrates; and having done this, they preached publickly,
without any regard to us; upon which, the QUEEN's Advo∣cate
INSTRUMENTED the Magistrates, in order to oblige
us to shut them up again; or that we should be answerable
to the Government for the neglect of our Duty; the Privy-Council
in <HI>Scotland</HI> being then taken away.”</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31"/>
“As to the Ministers being cited, who were quallifyed or not qualli∣syed
first, there were three or four of them never cited at all,
neither in <HI>March</HI> nor afterward, tho' they were not quallified, be∣cause
it was generally believed they were good Men, and behaved
themselves more peaceably than the rest; of these were Mr.
<HI>Johnson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lumsdale,</HI> but this <HI>Walker</HI> is not the
same with him mention'd in the Process—Nor was there one
quallifyed Minister among them, except Mr. <HI>Sutherland</HI>—Who
tho' quallifyed, made use of his being so, to set up other un∣quallifyed
Ministers in his Pulpit, who not only did not pray
for the Queen, but as we were inform'd, used publick Reflections
in the said Pulpit against the Government, both in Church
and State; yet he receiv'd no other Punishment, than a Charge
not to suffer any unquallifyed Minister to Preach in his Place.”</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adam Peacock</HI> pleaded, that he was quallified, but it appearing
“to be done after the first Citation, he having gone to my Lord
<HI>Cromarty,</HI> who had suffer'd him to quallify after the Citation; we
reported the same to the Council, which they judged to be Ille∣gal;
but farther, the Coucil would not admit of the Plea of
Mr. <HI>Peacock,</HI> because he was Deposed by the Process of the Church
for Scandal, which Sentence of Deposing was produc'd.”</P>
<P>“As to citing those only that made use of the <HI>English</HI> Service; There
was no Distinction made at all of those who used it, or those
who did not; they were all cited in <HI>March</HI> 1708. whereof not a∣bove
three or four of them at most, us'd the <HI>English Service,</HI> as
we were inform'd.—”</P>
<P>Let any Impartial Considering Person upon reading this, tell us, whe∣ther
the Magistrates have acted any thing less or more than their Duty
to their Sovereign obliged them to; or whether they did not shew all
the Tenderness to the said Ministers, which consisted with their Duty;
how well the <HI>Narrative</HI> requites them for that Tenderness, is left to e∣very
Impartial Judgement to determine.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Fourth Enquiry,</HI> is relating to the Behaviour of the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and whether it has not obliged the Government to do
this; but this being spoken to under the Head of Reasons, justify∣ing
the Government in this Prosecution; we shall confine this Part
of it to their several Behaviours, since their first Citation, and
under the respective Proceedings of the Magistrates, and the
Arg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ments used by the <HI>Narrative,</HI> in Defence of their Meetings,
and upon which, they pretend to claim the Liberty they take,
may come under this Head to be consider'd.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32"/>
And first their Behaviour under the Sentence—Which it seems was
as above, to requite the Lenity of the Magistrates, with a Contempt
of their Authority, and with a Breach of the Peace, as well as a
Violation of the Respect due for the Civility of not sending them
to Prison, as the Magistrates were desir'd to do.</P>
<P>This shew'd not a Disrespect to the Persons of the Magistrates only,
as well as a Contempt of Authority, but seem'd to be something Disin∣genuous
to that Courtesy, that had forborn committing them to the Toll-Booth
when they not only had it in their Power, but when the Govern∣ment
expected it of them.</P>
<P>Next is to be observ'd their Pleading to the Jurisdiction of the Ma∣gistrates,
and consequently pretending they were not comptetent Judges,
in which they were effectually answer'd, that the Act of Parliament re∣ferring
the Sentencing them to the Privy-Council, and the Privy-Council
referring it again to the Magistrates; they had by that means a Right of
Determining in this Matter; besides, that being Legal Magistates within
the Burgh of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the Time being, all the Inhabitants of the
said Burgh were consequently within their Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>We come now to consider their several Dilators or Demurs to the Le∣gality
of the Proceedings; and because we will not presume to answer
wholly in our own Sence we shall give you this Part Word for Word from
the hand of a Person, for Knowledge and Experience in the Laws of <HI>Scot∣land,
without Reflection on any,</HI> as eminent as any in <HI>Scotland, whose Name
when occasion requires, 'twill be an Honour to this Tract to mention,</HI> and which
may be mentioned, and his Authority for it produc'd, when ever such
Occasion appears.</P>
<P>In this short Draught are some modest Answers to such, of the Insinu∣ations
in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> which we have omitted, and which we have
purposely referr'd to this Place, and with this we shall conclude, having
spoken what we hope will be satisfactory to the most material Points of
Fact before—What is needful to add as to Generals, shall be couched in
a Postscript after the Pattern of the <HI>Narrative,</HI> and to which the Rea∣der
is farther referr'd.</P>
<P>Brief and plain Answers to the Matters of Law, and some other Obje∣ctions,
made to the late Proceedings against the Episcopal Ministers in
<HI>EDINBURGH.</HI></P>
<P>“1. It is evident, that the foresaid Tryal and Proceedings against
the disaffected Preachers in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> was only on the Account of
their notour and dangerous Disaffection, in not praying for Her Ma∣jesty,
and not swearing Allegiance to Her as the Law requires; for
tho' the Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> would have it believ'd, that they were
proceeded against on the Act of Parliament, 1695. as Intruders, and for
exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing any Part of their Ministerial Function within <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> yet
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
the contrary is manifest from the Libel exhibited against them, which
proceeds only from the Points abovementioned, and to which there
was no satisfying Answer made. I'ts true, some of them pretended
they had prayed for the Queen, but when demanded if they had taken
the Oath of Allegiance, they as plainly refused it; and albeit it was
urged, with what sincerity they could be understood to pray for Her
Majesty, since they refused to swear Allegiance to Her, and that in effect
praying for Her, was the only proper Allegiance that could be requi∣red
of Ministers; They answer'd nothing; it being very certain, that
even such as pray for Her Majesty, do it in such ambig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Terms,
and with such an Extension to all the Royal Family, as plainly includes
the Pretender, and still tends to uphold the Faction.”</P>
<P>“But, <HI>Sec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndly,</HI> Other of them were so bold, and yet they were all of a
Piece; as when questioned, how they could omit to pray for her Majesty,
since they profess'd to use the <HI>English Service,</HI> To answer plainly,
that they pass'd and overleap'd that Part of the Service, than which no∣thing
could be more Undutiful.”</P>
<P>“But this <HI>Narrative</HI> would have the World believe, That the only
Reason why these Men are prosecuted, is, because they are for <HI>Episcopacy,</HI>
and the Worship of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and where this insinuation
points is easie to be discern'd; but waving the general Notion of <HI>E∣piscopacy,</HI>
as also what regards the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> as not of our pre∣sent
Concern; it may certainly be truly said, That <HI>Scots Prelacy,</HI> consi∣dering
its use first and last, with its unaccountable Practices and sad
Effects, for which it hath been in a little more than an Age twice thrown
out and abolish'd; must be even odious to all good Men, and that affe∣cted
Innovations being always very distracting, Novelties of this kind
in Matters of Religion prove ever more hurtful than edifying.”</P>
<P>The <HI>Narrative</HI> rips up many things which are already fully answer'd, and
which it had been far more advisable for the Author to have conceal'd. As
where he says, That the late <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> have been very hardly
us'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> as first, a great Part of them in the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>South</HI>
rabled out of their Churches, and then the rest ensnared as it were
with new Laws, and thereby thrown out: But as to the Rabbling,
any Man reflect on the first Entry of these Gentlemen, with that Deluge
of Prophanity that attended it; and how they tyranniz'd over
poor Peoples Consciences, (for quiet Submission was then no
Man's safty) with uuheard of Violences and Indignities, and not
conclude that they were the cause of all the Mischief that ensued;
and can any Man consider, how the <HI>West</HI> and a great part of the
<HI>South</HI> were truly reduced to that Condition, that scarce a Family was
to be found, that had not either a Father, Son, Brother, or near Re∣lation
hang'd, murther'd, tortur'd, banish'd, or grievously impri∣son'd;
besides the heavy and unaccountable Calamities of the Highland
Host; and not rather wonder that the Change happen'd so easily at
the late Happy Revolution; it being a thing known, that the most part
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
of these Men, then call'd <HI>Curates,</HI> were suffer'd to flee away in the fer∣ror
they were conscious of, without any other Prejudice; and that
the few that staid behind were only remov'd without the least
hurt, either to their Persons or Goods; a Moderation indeed most re∣markable
in these poor Men, who dealt so well with their Adversa∣ries,
when thus deliver'd into their hand, for as was said of old; <HI>If a
Man find his Enemy, will he let him go well away?</HI>”</P>
<P>“But this Author says, since these <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> were rabbl'd out
by Violence; why were they not again reponed in Justice by the Go∣vernment?
and to deal plainly, it is very certain, that tho' the Go∣vernment
had then reponed them in the amplest manner; yet they
durst not have adventur'd back, nor could they have been restor'd with∣out
downright Force; a Service which, all things consider'd, no wise
Government could judge worthy of the Cost.”</P>
<P>“As for the Acts of Convention and Parliament, whereof the <HI>Narrative</HI>
complains, as purposely made to ensnare and throw out; the Injustice of
this Charge may easily appear from considering, That the Act of Con∣vention
was fairly and honestly made; That all Ministers and Preachers
shou'd pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> upon whom the Crown
was then settl'd; which was wholly agreeable to the Direction of the
Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Duty of all good Subjects; and without all doubt
was not only intended for them, but for all their Royal Suc∣cessors.”</P>
<P>“But
here the <HI>Narrative</HI> pleads a hardship put on the Clergy, because
of the short warning they had to transfer in that manner their Alle∣giance,
when they lay under former Engagements, and had been for a
long time habitual to the observance thereof; and as to this Point the
<HI>Narrative</HI> declares plainly enough, how much they did judge, and still do
judge themselves under former Engagements to the late King <HI>James,</HI> and the
Pretender now in his Place. But seeing these very Men were Witnesses to
all the Causes that preceded the Claim of Right, and could not but
also see the extraordinary hand of God, that <HI>per volentes Populos,</HI> brought
about so wonderfully the happy Revolution; and how the same was
carried on by the consent of all good Men, and settled by the Authori∣ty
of both Kingdoms, and the good Effects that since have ensued, for
them to pretend either Conscience or Surprize to dem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rr their comply∣ance,
is too manifest <HI>Jacobitism</HI> to deserve any Answer.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Secondly,</HI> The next Act of Parliament they complain of is, the Sixth
Act of the Parliament, 1693. Whereby all Ministers and Preachers are
Ordained to take the Allegiance with the Assurance, under the Pains if
Benefic'd, of being deprived, and if not Benefic'd, to be punish'd by
Banishment, or otherwise at the Pleasure of the Privy-Council. That
this Act doth concern all Preachers, and that the same is rather con∣firmed
than weaken'd by the Act, Recognizing Her Majesty, and doth
bind not only to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> hath been already
fully clear'd.”</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="35"/>
“But here the <HI>Narrative</HI> first Insinuates, That in Matters of Conscience
and Religious Oaths, it belongs rather to the Clergy to direct, than
to be directed; and that the Certification could never throw them out
of their Ministry, which they receiv'd not from Man, but from their
Lord and Master.”</P>
<P>“To which 'tis answer'd, That if the Government cannot devise and
impose so plain an Oath, as the Oath of Allegiance appears to be, for
its own necessary Security, it can do nothing; and the Assarance is no
more than the just Explication thereof. But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> These Gentle∣men
should consider, That this Oath of Allegiance is only requir'd of
them as Preachers, and to prevent them in that Capacity, from either
Poisoning Her Majesty good Subjects, or fomenting Faction to Her
Prejudice, and imposes no farder either upon their Opinion or Con∣science.”</P>
<P>“It
was indeed a part of the Rigour of the late Times, that Men
were told they must either comply with the King's Pleasure, or they
were unworthy to breath the King's Air; but now it is the benign
Goodness of Her Majesty, that <HI>Dissenters</HI> may both enjoy their Opi∣nion
and their Conscience, and freely breath GOD's Air, provi∣ding
they disturb not the Publick Peace, wherein their own Peace is
included; so that the Question now is, not whether Men shall renounce
either their Opinions or their Consciences, but precisely, If Men can be
tolerate to Preach in Publick Meetings, who notoriously declare their
Disaffection to Her Majesty and her Government, by refusing to pray for
her and promise her Allegiance, as the Law requires: A Point so clear,
that it may well be affirmed, there is not a State or Kingdom in the
Earth that would allow such a Sett of Men to follow such an Employ∣ment
on such Conditions.”</P>
<P>“But the <HI>Narrative</HI> says, there are many <HI>Presbyterian Preachers</HI> over∣look'd
in this Matter, and not put to take the Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But is it
not as well known, That these <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> did at first shew such
a Readiness in this Matter, and do all along, both in their Doctrine,
Worship, and Conversation, declare so plainly and clearly their Alle∣giance
and Fidelity to her Majesty and her Government, that it is im∣possible
to fix on them the least suspicion, and as superfluous to require
of them any Purgation.”</P>
<P>But the <HI>Narrative</HI> says, That these <HI>Dissenting Preachers</HI> are all very
“good Subjects, professing entire Subjection, and disowning all Se∣ditions
and Rebellious Principles, and Men truly loving and observing
Peace; and here we have the insinuation of their old Cant, for abso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te
Subjection, and for Passive-Obedience, and against all defensive
Arms; the Vanity whereof is sufficiently every where discover'd. But,
<HI>first,</HI> may it not be heartily wish'd, that these so very Peaceable and
Passive Men may never meet with such Provocations, as others have
had, even from their Hands. And next how can we believe them to be
so Peaceable, who refuse to pray for, and promise Allegiance to Her
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
Majesty; when GOD hath commanded the same to all Subjects for
this very End, that we may lead a Peaceable Life under them; as
likewise what Opinion can we have, either of their Peaceableness or Loyal
Subjection, who not only forbear to keep Fasts for Success and Thanks∣givings,
for Victories against Her Majesty and our Declared Enemies
but openly neglect, despise and flout at the same?”</P>
<P>“The <HI>Narrative</HI> says, That yet they are good Men, and cannot be
charged with any Immorality in their Lives, or Error in their Do∣ctrine,
or Exception against their Worship. And again, that their
Doctrine, Worship, and Practice cannot be Taxed: For their Im∣moralities,
it were indeed heartily to be wish'd, that both they and
we, were clearer from that Charge; but next, how can they excuse
their Practice, or purge themselves of Immorality, who are so notourly
disaffected towards their Soveraigns Government, and the Peace also of her
Kingdoms. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Doth not their denying of Error in their Do∣ctrine,
or any thing censurable in their Worship sufficiently acknow∣ledge,
that their Doctrine and Worship is upon the Matter, the same
with the Doctrine and Worship of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> as they indeed
are: But then, why do they separate, and so tenaciously foment and
maintain Schism; or where is the Point of Conscience that can be
pleaded for this Division?”</P>
<P>“But this <HI>Narrative</HI> says, Neither they nor their Hearers can allow
of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination;</HI> not can they endure that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI>
should banish the Apostles Creed, the Doxology, the Ten Command∣ments,
and the Lords Prayer from the Worship of GOD. As to
the Point of Ordination, they of late insist much on this Topick, to
impose on the Simple, as if <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had no Lawful Ordination, and
consequently no Lawful Ordinances: But this Question having been
so fully and often debated, it may be sufficient here to affirm, That
the Call of GOD, with our Lord's Mission, in the Way and Order
agreeable to Scripture, is undoubtedly the best Title and Authority to
qualify a true Minister, and all his Administrations: This was the
only Title and Authority that the Apostles themselves had; and it was
by the same Call and Mission, that the first Propagators of the Gospel,
after their being scatter'd from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> went every where preaching
the Word, travelling even as far as <HI>Phenice, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI>
without the least mention of so much as an Apostolick License.”</P>
<P>“But if these <HI>Episcopal Brethren</HI> will still contend for an Ordination
with a Pedigree derived from Noble Ancestors▪ We are far from en∣vying
them that Church Heraldry, since it must still be attended with
many horrible Blots as well as Blanks in their Escutcheon.”</P>
<P>“But where the <HI>Narrative</HI> says, that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> do banish the
Ten Commandments, the Lords Prayer, the Apostles Creed, and the
Doxology from their Worship. What Accusation can be more unjust,
seeing as to the Ten Commandments and the whole Law of GOD,
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
they profess them to be their continual Mediation, the Delight of their
Heart, a Lamp unto their Feet a Light unto their Path, the
great Subject of their Doctrine, and the Rule of their Lives. And
as to Lord's Prayer, they firmy believe, and most heartily embrace
it, as the most perfect Pattern of Prayer, which our Lord himself did
only give without the help of any <HI>Jewish</HI> Liturgy, as some of these very
Men do groundlessly affirm; for the Apostles Creed <HI>as they call it,</HI> it is in∣deed
of a lower Origin; <HI>and known to be</HI> no Composure of the Apostles,
tho' it contains indeed their Faith and Doctrine, nor yet was it so much as
heard of in the Church for the first three Centuries; after which this <HI>For∣mula,</HI>
indeed appear'd, but not without notable Variations, which remain
even to this Day; but since the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have in their Confession of
Faith, so diligently and exactly explain'd and extended it; and so fully
confirm'd it; and thus do so constantly use it? With what Truth can
they be said to have banish'd it from their Worship. <HI>Lastly,</HI> As to the
Doxology, a Man might doubt if the Objector did understand the true
meaning of the Word, since almost all our Prayers, both in Publick
and Private are therewith <HI>in terminis,</HI> concluded.”</P>

not only countenanced a Party and Faction Disaffected to Her Majesty's

particularly of the Sixteenth Act of the Convention of Estates.
<HI>Anno</HI> One Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Nine Years; Requiring

and of the Sixth Act of the Parliament, holden in <HI>Anno</HI> One Thousand

of the Gospel to take the Oath of Allegiance, and to subscribe
the same with the Assurance in the Terms, and under the Certifi∣cations
mention'd in the said Acts; And furder it was Libell'd against
them; That they out of a Factious Principle against Her Majesty's
Government, and the Peace and Security of the Kingdom were re∣gardless
and negligent in observance of Publick Fasts and Thanksgi∣vings:
Which Accusations (being as the Libel alledg'd) Notour and
Proving themselves: Therefore it was concluded, that we having in∣curr'd
the Pains of the Law, ought to be decerned to desist from
Preaching, or keeping of Meeting-Houses within the Bounds of the
good Town and to find Caution for that Effect, or otherwise be Im∣prison'd
until due Obedience were given. <HI>For Answer</HI> to the Libel;
they did take leave in the first Place, to urge some Reasons, as well a∣gainst
the Formality of the Procedure, as against the Competency and
Relevancy of the Libel; and in the next Place should offer such An∣swers,
as were founded upon the Rules and Principles, both of Cha∣rity
and Christianity. The Informality of Procedure as they humbly
conceiv'd, was evident from the Seventy Second Act of the Sixth Par∣liament
of King <HI>James</HI> V. Whereby it was Statute and Ordain'd, That
all Citations upon the Precepts of inferior Judges, shall be upon Fif∣ten
Days, which tho' it might have been said to be in Desuetude, as
to Citations within Burgh, in Relation to Civil Cases or Petry Delin∣quences;
yet it should have been duly observ'd in the Citatious given,
upon Libels, Criminal, of which sort the present was; that so Defen∣ders
might not for want of Time be over-reach'd, but have a full
allowance thereof, to propone and defend against such high Accusa∣tions
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Tho' by the Twenty Second Act of King <HI>William</HI>'s

Sheri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffs, Stua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and their Deputies, and the Magistrates of Burghs-Royal,
were Authoriz'd and requir'd to put in Execution the said Law,
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
whereby the intruding into vacant Churches, and exercising any Parts
of the Ministerial Function within any Parish, without an orderly Call
and Legal Admission was discharged. Yet the Execution should have
been in such a method, as the said Act prescrib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> upon a Complaint
from the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> within whose Bounds the said Illegal Exercise was,
or any Person having their Warrant, and upon Citation of Ten Days;
and therefore in the present Case, there being no Complaint from the
<HI>Presbytery,</HI> or any having their Warrant, and the Citation not being
above Tea Days, but upon a far shorter time, the Procedure appear'd
Unwarrantable. In the like manner it was with submission, contended,
That the Magistrates of the <HI>good Town</HI> were not Judges competent of
the Libel, because it was chiefly founded upon the Sixth Act of King
<HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> One Thousand Six Hun∣dred
and Ninety Three Years, requiring all Ministers and Preachers
of the Gospel, to take the Oath of Allegiance, and subscribe the As∣surance;
Whereas, by the said Act it was provided, that the Con∣traveener
should be punish'd by Banishment, or otherwise as the Coun∣cil
(<HI>meaning the Privy Council</HI>) should think fit. And therefore the Libel
was improperly tabl'd there; since Magistrates of Royal Burghs could
not competently Judge therein. Adhering to their foresaid Dilator, and
Defences clearly founded upon the express Acts of Parliaments above
cited, and which they craved <HI>ante omnia</HI> to be Discussed. They did
proceed with all submission to call in question, and impugn the Rele∣vancy
of the Libel, which tho' inforc'd with the present Circumstan∣ces
of the Country, as threaten'd with an Invasion; yet it was con∣tended,
that the Qualifications and Acts subsumed upon, were no ways
Relevant for inferring the Conclusion Libell'd. As to which, the first
in order was the Sixteenth Act of the meeting of the Estates, Or∣daining
all Ministers within this Kingdom to pray for King <HI>William</HI>
and Queer <HI>Mary,</HI> as King and Queen of this Realm; of which Act
they are Libell'd as Contraveeners, because they did not as was al∣ledg'd
pray for Her Majesty QUEEN <HI>ANNE.</HI> It was answered
(1.) That the Persons, for whom Publick Prayers were ordered to be
made by the said Act were Dead, and the Act should dye with them
in Consequence. (2.) That it was Invidious for the Pursuer to bring
their Prayers into the Accusation, seeing he could not alledge against
them any Words or Expressions, that betrayed Contempt of Authori∣ty,
or Disrespect to their Persons. They prayed for the whole <HI>Royal
Family.</HI> And that they were none of those who despis'd Dominions, or
speak'd Evil of Dignities, and therefore could not conceive upon what
Ground that Part of the Accusation was founded against them; espe∣cially
seeing there was no Form of Prayer, in relation to the Particular
impos'd by any Law, and that where there was no Law, there could
be no Transgression. As to the Act of Parliament, One Thousand Six
Hundred and Ninety Three Years, Ordaining all Ministers and Preach∣ers
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
of the Gospel to take the Allegiance, and subscribe the Assurance.
It was answer'd, <HI>First.</HI> That it would appear to Men, such only as
were settled in Charges, and injoyed Benefices, and that they were the
more warranted to say so by the Act of Recognition, that injoyned
the taking of them to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> obliged only them that were in
Publick Trust, Civil, Ecclesiastick, or Military, which reached not the
Case of the Defenders, who could not be supposed to have had any
Trust, when they had not so much a Legal Toleration: And whatever
could have been the Sence of the Act, One Thousand Six Hundred and
Ninety Three Years, It was out of Doors, being limited to the Per∣sons
of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and even of those that were
in Trust by posession of Benefices. It was known there were several
that had never quallifyed themselves in the Terms of the Law. The
Government being so far indulgent, as to have superseded the Execu∣tion
of a Law in some Cases, rather than to have imposed upon the weak
and tender Consciences of any; particularly of those of the Ministe∣rial
Function. And therefore it was not to be imagin'd, that the Ma∣gistrates
of the City (in behalf whereof they were not wanting in their
Prayers to Heaven) would give their countenance to the Libel, that
proceeded upon the stretching of Laws beyond their true meaning a∣gainst
them, who injoyed no Benefice under the Government. And
tho' they could not alledge any Law for these Meetings; yet they
had good Reason to plead, that there was no Law against them, for
these Laws that were urged against Meeting-Houses could never be
interpreted to their Prejudice, but by stretching them beyond their
intent. For the Act 22 <HI>Anno</HI> One Thousand Six Hundred and Ninety
Five Years, frequently made use of against them; Entitl'd, <HI>An Act a∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st
intruding into Churches and Benefices,</HI> They humbly conceiv'd the
Meaning and Design thereof only, to be the Disposessing of <HI>Episcopal
Ministers</HI> of their Churches and Manses; That the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> might
have had free Access to them. So as nothing could, according to the
Letter of the Law, be construed an intrusion on the Part of the <HI>Epis∣copal
Minister,</HI> but the entring into these Churches (which were once
declared Vacant) without a Legal Call. But that it was far from the
Thoughts of the Government or Parliament under that Head; to com∣prehend
the Exercises of the Ministry, by People of <HI>Episcopal Perswasion</HI>
in any other Place, and thereby to exclude the Ministers and People of
that Judgment from the Benefit of Ordinances, and opportunity of Sa∣craments;
and this was the more plain way that never any Law could
be procur'd, for obliging the People under the Penalties to resort to
the <HI>Presbyterian Preachers,</HI> and to receive the Sacraments from them,
which was Natural for them to demand. And it was further evident,
That the Design and Intent of these Acts was never levell'd against
these Private Meetings in little Houses, because the Queen in her most
Gracious Letter in <HI>February,</HI> the Fourth Day, One Thousand Seven
Hundred and Three Years, consider'd Meeting-Houses, as having a Ta∣cit
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
Allowance, ordering them to be protected, whilst they lived De∣cently
and Regularly as good Christians and Subjects. And in so do∣ing,
that they should be protected in the Peaceable Exercise of their
Religion, and in their Persons and Estates, according to the Laws
of the Kingdom. In the Posession of which Favour they had
continued hitherto, by Vertue of the Authority foresaid, and was
homologated by the Parliaments that had sitten ever since, who never
had quarrel'd these Meetings, nor had made any Laws against them.
And they were confident that they had done nothing, either in the saids
Meetings, or any other where, that might have deprived them of their
Liberty. And therefore did claim the continuance of the said Favour,
and that all Process against them might cease, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill Her Majesty's farther
Pleasure, thereanent were signifyed; it having been usual for Royal Fa∣vours
once granted not to be Re-call'd, unless the Conditions stipula∣ted
had been by the People violated and broken, which could not here
be justly alledg'd. And as to the neglecting of Publick Fasts and
Thanksgivings, which was the third and last quallification of the Libel.
It was answer'd, That they were not usually directed to them, or other
Preachers in Meeting-Houses. And particularly the last Proclamation
for a Fast, was only directed to Ministers in Churches, who could only
be challeng'd for neglect thereof, if any such there were. And there∣fore
their not observing them publickly in their Meeting Houses, could
not be constructed a Crime, or Fault; yea, in such Cases they were at a
stand how to carry, lest the calling together their Hearers on such Oc∣casions,
might been thought presumptuous, and given offence, even to
some in the Government. Having thus answer'd their Libel in Point of
Law; they conclude their Defence with a Word or two from the Prin∣ciples
of Christianity and Charity. As to which they begg'd leave to
say, that it was not altogether agreeable to the Rules of Christianity, for
their Accuser, to endeavour the shutting up of their Mouths and
Meeting-Houses, since they thereby design'd nothing so much as the
Glory of GOD, and the Advantage of the Souls of those who were
pleased to hear them. And albeit, it might by the Providence of God,
prove a comfortable Mean, for subsisting of their Families; they could
not think that their Accusers, or any other, were so invidious, as to
grudge them the same, or so cruel as to be offended thereat, and by the
Process to deprive them of the same. And that the Libel appear'd no less
disagreeable to the Government, charging them as factious and Encou∣ragers
of Wicked Designs against the Country, which uncharitable
Thought they presum'd to say, could had no Rise from their Practices,
Lives, or Doctrines, since they in their private and several Stations had
kep'd their selves Disinterested from all Publick Affairs and Matters of Go∣vernment,
and could give the Defiance to their greatest Enemies, to give
the least Instance of any Disorder or Disturbance, occasion'd either
from their selves or Meeting-Houses. And therefore these high Crimes
where with they were charged in the Libel appear'd both groundless and
invidious.”</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="46"/>
In Respect whereof it was expected, that the Honourable Lord Provost and
Magistrates of the good Town would have no Regard to the Libel exhibited
against them, or allow their Fiscal to insist further in the Prosecution thereof.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT cannot but be obvious now to any considering Reader, that has
given himself the trouble to peruse these Sheets; That the Cry of
Persectuion which has made so much Noise in the World, has some other
Foundation than the true Matter of Fact will bear.</P>
<P>The naked Truth appears in few Words. Thus, there are in the City
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a great number of profess'd Enemies, to the Government,
to the Succession, to the Settlement of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the
Union, who openly avow themselves <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and are not asham'd of
it. These by the Lenity of the Government, had their open Assembly,
and Episcopal Ministers to preach to them, but all <HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> they
neither prayed for the QUEEN, or swore Allegiance to the QUEEN;
nay, some were come to that height, as expressly to pray for the Pre∣tender—That
is for THE KING, as they call'd him; yet the Go∣vernment
forbore them, till the Alarm was given of a Powerful Inva∣sion
in favour of the Pretender: Then in order to discourage the Friends
of that Party, These Meetings were ordered to be suppress'd as is related.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more reasonable, than to have it be so, even our
Enemies themselves being Judges.</P>
<P>'Tis a plain and clear Truth, that not a Man in <HI>Scotland</HI> has been si∣lencd,
or a Meeting-House shut up, but on this very Account; nay such
has been the Lenity of the late Lord Provost, Sir <HI>Samuel Mac-Clellan</HI> to
this very Party, for which they very ill requite him, That he show'd
them Favours and Civilities they could not expect.</P>
<P>As <HI>first,</HI> Three of these very Dissenters he never cited at all, nor shut
up their Houses; nor has the present Lord Provost and Magistrates dis∣continued
that Favour, but those three are now openly preaching in <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI>
and this purely with respect to the Characters of the Ministers,
being esteemed Peaceable good Men; these are by Name, Mr.—<HI>Johnston,</HI>
Mr.—<HI>Lumsdal,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Walker.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> was order'd to be sent to Prison for Con∣tempt,
in passing the Prayer for the Queen in the <HI>English Service,</HI> he slipt
out and went away, and the Provost never caused him to be apprehended
again; which his Lordship might easily have done.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Of the Five Ministers sentenc'd to Prison, only three were
confin'd, tho on a plain Contempt of the Magistrates; and even those
the Lord Provost in his mere Compassion to them let go again, without
either Signing or finding Caution, as they were Sentenc'd.</P>
<P>So that instead of a Persecution of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> here is nothing but sup∣pressing
profest <HI>Jacobite Conventicles,</HI> the same thing that is done by the
Church of <HI>England</HI> all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49"/>
In doing which instead of the Magistrates using them hardly and straining
the Law upon them, as the <HI>Narrative</HI> suggests; the then Lord Pro∣vost
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Sir <HI>Samuel Mac-Clellan,</HI> and the rest of the Magi∣strates
used them with all the Gentleness, Tenderness, and Compassion
possible, or that could consist with their Duty.</P>
<P>And as all this is Litterally and Undeniably true, it renders them in∣excusably
to blame, both to spread abroad such Complaints of Persecu∣tion
in general, as if Episcopacy was Persecuted as such, and very un∣grateful
to the Lenity and Courtesy of the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But more inexcusable still are they, who with Design to spread Divi∣sions,
and encrease Animosities between the Nations, have industriously
fill'd the Heads of the People in <HI>England</HI> with formal Stories, of the Cru∣elty
of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> to the Episcopal Ministers in <HI>Scoland;</HI> and tho' it
may grate very hard upon his Reputation, we cannot but wonder how one
Mr. <HI>Cameron,</HI> a known Dissenting Minister in <HI>Scoland,</HI> could satisfy his Con∣science,
when at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> not many Months since, he publickly villify'd
the Government of <HI>Britain,</HI> with Persecuting Episcopacy, at the same
time knowing perfectly well, the Truth of what is here set down, that
none reciv'd any Molestation, but such as openly rejected the QUEEN
and her Government.</P>
<P>Nor was that Gentleman pleased to observe, even common Decency
in his Reflections upon his own Country, and upon the Magistrates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whom he was ples'd to give too course Language too, to have
it repeated here; but there is no wonder to be made, that Good Manners
should be wanting, where Truth was always wanting; and when Men
abandon their Consciences, they frequently let their Honour decay at
the same time.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this Tract with this short Observation; It seems the
last resort of the Enemies to the late Happy Union of this Island, That
they apply themselves as diligently as possible, to keep up and Form
<HI>De novo,</HI> Publick National Aversions between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI>
—They know the Blessings and Advantages that attend the Union,
are only to be found in Union; they know, if the Temper, Genius,
and Affections of the People Unite, as their Politick Capacities are U∣nited,
they will grow formidable and invulnerable, and therefore with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too successful Policy, they strive to keep the People as much
as possible divided, and this they find but too easie to do, especially by
the Artisice of this Party; they know nothing can exasperate the Church
of <HI>England</HI> so much, as to hear that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> Persecute People, on∣ly
for their Affinity to their Church, and therefore they gloss their Ac∣counts
with that specious out side, tho' nothing in Nature is more absurd,
or in Fact more untrue.</P>
<P>We heartily wish the Two Nations <HI>now become one,</HI> would apply
themselves to Unite in Interests and Assections, and mark those that sow,
Divisions among them on either side.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="50"/>
If National Aversions and National Prejudices are not laid asleep on
both sides, the Effects of the Union can never be answerable to our hopes
on either side.</P>
<P>How shall it be expected, That <HI>English</HI> Merchants should embark their
Stocks in Fishery, or plant their Families in <HI>Scotland?</HI> How should they
undertake Manufactures or Improvements, in order to employ the Peo∣ple
and cultivate the Lands, while in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are represented as a
People, designing to invade their Church, fill'd with implacable Aver∣sions
to their Discipline, and uneasy under the Security of the Church
obtain'd by the Treaty, while they are Represented there as coming a∣mong
them to supplant and subject them.</P>
<P>Again, how shall the <HI>Scots</HI> joyn heartily in your Defence, fight for you
by Land and Sea, and with their brave Spirits and able Bodies face your
Enemies? How shall they chearfully pay your Taxes and Customs, and
go hand in hand with you in all your new Models, while you look upon
them as Enemies to your Church, and Dangerous to your Settlement;
while you asperse and reproach them; and every Day suffer their Nati∣on
to be insulted, their Judicatories to be affronted, their Magistracy
slander'd, and insolent unsufferable Abuses offer'd them in Print, with∣out
Redress or without Reproof?</P>
<P>These are not the steps wise Men would take to Unite us; the encrease
of these Divisions, is the true way to destroy the Peace on both sides, and
to defeat every honest Man of his just hopes from the Union.</P>
<P>'Tis for this End these false Reports are rais'd, and Reproaches daily
given out; 'tis for this End that false Suggestions are rais'd and spread
about on both sides—Merely to keep open a Breach between the
Nations, and if possible to introduce the old Confusions of their sepa∣rate
State—Which GOD of His Infinite Mercy prevent, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
