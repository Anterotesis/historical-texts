<P>I pray thee, Lord <HI>Camillo,</HI> instruct
me, what concealed matter there is in the coming
of <HI>Leontes</HI> to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> shou'd so wrap our king in
astonishment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good sign your knowledge in the court is young,
if you make that your question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I wou'd not be thought too curious, but I prithee,
be my tutor in this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>To be short then—Give it thy hearing, for my
tale is well worthy of it; these two kings, <HI>Leontes</HI> of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Polixenes</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> were train'd toge∣ther
in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt
'em such an affection as cou'd not chuse but branch
as it grew up. One unhappy summer (and full six∣teen
as unhappy have follow'd it) our <HI>Polixenes</HI> went
to repay <HI>Sicily</HI> the visitation which he justly ow'd
him.—Most royally, and with the utmost freedom
of society, was he entertain'd both by <HI>Leontes,</HI> and
his queen <HI>Hermione;</HI> a lady, whose bodily accom∣plishments
were unparallel'd, but by those of her
own mind. The free strokes of youth and gaiety,
in her extended civility to <HI>Polixenes</HI> (pleas'd as she
was to see her lord delighted) bred in him suspicion
of her conduct.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is an evil weed, that once taking root,
needs no manure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I then waited about the person of <HI>Leontes,</HI> and
was alone thought worthy the participation of his
jealousy. Into my bosom he disgorg'd his monstrous
secret, with no tenderer an injunction than to take
off his innocent, abused guest, by poison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To kill <HI>Polixenes!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so.—What cou'd I do? What ran evenest
with the grain of my honesty I did, and have not
since repented me:—whisper'd <HI>Polixenes</HI> of the mat∣ter—left
my large fortunes, and my larger hopes
in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and on the very wing of occasion slew with
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
him hither, no richer than my honor; and have
since been ever of his bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tremble for the poor queen, left to the injuries
of a powerful king, and jealous husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Left too in her condition! for she had some while
promis'd an heir to <HI>Sicily,</HI> and now, mark me,—for
the occasion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot surpass my attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scarcely settled in <HI>Bohemia</HI> here, we are alarm'd
with the arrival of <HI>Paulina</HI> (that excellent matron,
and true friend of her unhappy queen) from whom
we too soon learn how sad a tragedy had been acted
in <HI>Sicily</HI>—the dishonor'd <HI>Hermione</HI> clapp'd up in
prison, where she gave the king a princess—the
child (the innocent milk yet in her innocent mouth)
by the king's command, expos'd; expos'd even on
the desarts of this kingdom;—our <HI>Polixenes</HI> being
falsly deem'd the father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor babe! unhappy queen! tyrant <HI>Leontes!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>What blacker title will you six upon him, when
you shall hear that <HI>Hermione,</HI> in her weak condition
(the child-bed privilege deny'd, which belongs to
women of all fashion) was haul'd out to an open
mockery of trial; that on this inhuman outrage
(her fame being kill'd before) she died—in the very
prison where she was deliver'd, died; and that on
her decease, <HI>Paulina</HI> (whose free tongue was the
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
king's living scourge, and perpetual remembrancer
to him of his dead queen) fled with her effects, for
safety of her life, to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> here—I tire
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My king concern'd, I am too deeply interested in
the event, to be indifferent to the relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this did <HI>Leontes,</HI> in defiance of the plain an∣swer
of the oracle, by him consulted at <HI>Delphi;</HI>
which now, after sixteen years occurring to his more
sober thoughts, he first thinks it probable, then finds
it true, and his penitence thereupon is as extreme,
as his suspicions had been fatal. In the course of his
sorrows he has, as we are inform'd, twice attempted
on his life; and this is now his goad to the present
expedition; to make all possible atonement to his
injur'd brother <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and to us the fellow-sufferers
in his wrongs—we must break off—the king and
good <HI>Paulina</HI>—</P>

<P>Weep not now, <HI>Paulina,</HI> so long-gone-by misfor∣tunes;
this strange and unexpected visit, from <HI>Leontes,</HI>
calls all your sorrows up a-new: but good <HI>Paulina,</HI>
be satisfied that heav'n has will'd it so. That six∣teen
years absence shou'd pass unnotic'd by this king,
without exchange of gifts, letters, or embassies; and
now!—I am amaz'd as thou art; but not
griev'd—</P>
</SP>

<P>Nobly resolv'd: of him think we no more 'till he

<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hail, royal Sir. If the king of <HI>Sicily</HI> escape this
dreadful tempest, I shall esteem him a favourite of
the gods, and his penitence effectual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of that fatal country <HI>Sicily,</HI> and of its penitent
(as we must think him) and reconcil'd king, my
brother, (whose loss of his most precious queen and
child are even now afresh lamented) I prithee, speak
no more—say to me, when saw'st thou prince <HI>Flori∣zel,</HI>
my son? Fathers are no less unhappy, their issue
not being gracious, than they are in losing 'em, when
they have approv'd their virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince; what
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but
I have musingly noted, he is of late much retir'd
from court, and is less frequent to his princely exer∣cises
than formerly he hath appear'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have consider'd so much, <HI>Camillo,</HI> and with some
care; so far, that I have eyes under my service,
which look upon his removedness; from whom I
have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the
house of a most homely shepherd—A man, they say,
that from very nothing, is grown rich beyond the
imagination of his neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard too of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note; the report of her is
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
extended more than can be thought to begin from
such a cottage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's likewise part of my intelligence, and I fear,
the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou, <HI>Ca∣millo,</HI>
shalt accompany us to the place, where we
will (not appearing what we are) have some question
with the shepherd; from whose simplicity, I think
it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort
thither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I willingly obey your command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>My best <HI>Camillo!</HI>—we must disguise ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lest your royalty be discover'd by the attendance
of any of your own train; my steward, <HI>Dion,</HI> shall
provide disguises, and accompany your design with
all secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is well advis'd—I will make choice of some
few to attend us, who shall wait at distance from the
cottage—you instruct <HI>Dion</HI> in the matter, while we
prepare ourselves.</P>

<P>HOW fortune drops into the mouth of the dili∣gent
man?—see, if I be not transform'd courtier
again—four silken gamesters, who attended the king,
and were revelling by themselves, at some distance
from the shepherds, have drank so plentifully, that
their weak brains are turn'd topsy-turvy—I found
one of' em, an old court comrade of mine, retir'd from
the rest, sobering himself with sleep under the shade
of a hawthorn; I made use of our antient familiarity
to exchange garments with him; the pedlar's cloaths
are on his back, and the pack by his side, as empty
as his pockets, for I have sold all my trumpery;
not a counterfeit stone, nor a ribband, glass, poman∣der,
browch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape,
glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn; they throng'd who
shou'd buy first, as if my trinkets had been hal∣low'd,
and brought a benediction to the buyer; by
which means, I saw whose purse was best in picture;
and what I saw to my good use I remember'd—my
good <HI>Clown</HI> (who wants but something to be a rea∣sonable
man) grew so in love with the wenches song,
that he wou'd not stir his pettitoes 'till he had tune
and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to
me, that all their other senses stuck in ears: no hear∣ing,
no feeling, but my Sir's song, and admiring the
nothing of it. I pick'd and cut most of their festival
purses: and had not the old man come in with a
whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son,
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
and scar'd my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army;—ha, ha, ha,
what a fool honesty is! and trust, his sworn brother, a
very simple gentleman! I see this is the time the un∣just
man doth thrive; the gods do this year connive
at us, and we may do any thing extempore—aside,
aside, here is more matter for a hot brain. Ev'ry
lane's end, ev'ry shop, church, session, hanging,
yields a careful man work.</P>

<P>See, see, what a man you are now—there is no

<P>Nay, but hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to, then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him know the truth of the matter; how you
found her by the sea-side some eighteen years agone;
that there was this bundle with her, with the things
and trinkets contained therein; but there was some
money too, which being spent in nursing her, you
need say nothing about it, together with all the cir∣cumstances
of the whole affair; do it, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then, think'st thou?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, she being none of your flesh and
blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the
king, and so your flesh and blood is not to be pu∣nish'd
by him: shew those things—I say, you
found about her, those secret things: this being done,
let the law go whistle—I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell the king all, every word; yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest
man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to
make me the king's brother-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
cou'd have been to him; and then your blood had
been the dearer, by I know not how much an ounce.</P>

<P>Are you a courtier, an' like you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier—see'st
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odour from me? re∣flect
not I on thy baseness, court-contempt? think'st
thou for that I insinuate, or toze from thee thy bu∣siness,
I am therefore no courtier? I am a courtier
cap-à-pee; and one that will either push on, or push
back thy business there; whereupon, I command
thee to open thy affair.</P>

<P>The fardel there, what's in the fardel?</P>

<P>Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know but the king; and which he
shall know within this hour, if I may come to th'
speech of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Age, thou hast lost thy labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>The king is not at the palace, he's gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy, and air himself; for
if thou be'st capable of things serious, thou must
know the king is full of grief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, 'tis said, Sir, about his son that shou'd have
marry'd a shepherd's daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that shepherd be not in hand fast, let him fly;
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel,
will break the heart of man, the back of monster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think you so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not he, alone, shall suffer what wit can make
heavy, and vengeance bitter; but those that are ger∣main
to him, tho' remov'd fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman; which, tho' it be great pity,
yet it is necessary, an old sheep-whistling rogue, a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace!—Some say he shall be ston'd; but that
death is too soft for him, say I: draw our throne
into a sheep-cot! all deaths are too few, the sharpest
too easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has the old man e'er a son, Sir, do you hear,
an't like you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a son, who shall be flay'd alive, then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp's
nest; then stand 'till he be three quarters and a dram
dead; then recover'd again with aqua-vita, or some
other hot infusion; then (raw as he is, and in the
hottest day prognostication proclaims) shall he be set
against a brick wall, the sun looking with a south∣ward
eye upon him, where he is to behold him with
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
flies, blown to death; but what talk we of these
traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil'd at, their
offences being so capital? tell me, (for you seem to
be honest, plain men) what you have to the king;
being something gently consider'd, I'll bring you
where he is, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalf, and if it be in man, be∣sides
the king, to effect your suits, here is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
shall do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>He seems to be of great authority, close with 'im,
give him gold; tho' authority be a stubborn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear,
yet he is often led by the nose with gold; shew the
inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and
no more ado; remember ston'd and flay'd alive.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beseech you, Sir, now that my first burst of joy
is over, and my ebbing spirits no longer bear down
my attention, give my ear again the circumstances of
this strange story: <HI>Leontes</HI> arriv'd! escap'd from the
fury of the sea! veil'd in the 'semblance of a poor
shepherd! and has now thrown himself into the arms
of <HI>Polixenes!</HI> 'tis a chain of wonders!</P>
</SP>

<P>Yet the tale is not more wonderful than true; I

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak, Sir, speak; tell me all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soon as our king return'd to the palace, he re∣tir'd
with the good <HI>Camillo,</HI> to lament the unhappy
and ill-plac'd affection of his son: yet, as gleams of
sunshine oft break in upon a storm, so, thro' all
his indignation, there burst out by intervals paternal
love and sorrow; 'twas brought him that a person of
no great seeming intreated admittance; a refusal was
return'd to this bold request; but the stranger, un∣aw'd
by this discouragement, advanc'd to the king's
presence: his boldness had met with an equal punish∣ment,
had he not on the sudden assum'd a majesty
of mien and feature, that threw a kind of radiance
over his peasant garb, and fixt all who saw him with
silent wonder and admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>Polixenes!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He stept forth to the stranger; but 'ere he cou'd
enquire the reasons of his presumption—behold, said
<HI>Leontes</HI> bursting into grief, behold the unhappy
king, that much hath wrong'd you—behold <HI>Leontes!</HI>
—On this the king started from him—true, I have
wrong'd you, cry'd <HI>Leontes;</HI> but if penitence can
attone for guilt, behold these eyes, wept dry with ho∣nest
sorrow; this breast, rent with honest anguish; and
if you can suspect that my heart yet harbours those
passions which once infested it, here, I offer it to
your sword; lay it open to the day!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, the force, the charm of returning virtue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its charm was felt, indeed, by the generous king;
for at once forgetting that fatal enmity that had so
long divided them, he embrac'd the penitent <HI>Leontes,</HI>
with the unfeign'd warmth of one who had found a
long lost friend, return'd beyond hope from banish∣ment
or death; while <HI>Leontes,</HI> overwhelm'd with
such unlook'd-for goodness, fell on his neck, and
wept: thus they stood embracing and embrac'd, in
dumb and noble sorrow! their old friendship being
thus renew'd, <HI>Leontes</HI> began his intercession for prince
<HI>Florizel;</HI> but <HI>Polixenes</HI>—break we off—here comes
the good <HI>Camillo;</HI> speak, thou bear'st thy tydings in

<P>Gracious gods support me! his daughter found!
can it be? how was she sav'd? and where has she
been conceal'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>That shepherdess, our prince has so long and so
secretly affected, proves <HI>Sicilia</HI>'s heiress: the old
shepherd, her suppos'd father, deliver'd the manner
how he found her upon the coast, produc'd a fardel,
in which are uncontested proofs of every circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most true, if ever the truth were pregnant by cir∣cumstance;
that which you hear, you'll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of queen <HI>Hermione,</HI> her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters (pardon me, the mention of them) of
your lord <HI>Antigonus,</HI> found with it, which I know
to be his characters; the majesty of the creature in
resemblance of the mother; the affection of noble∣ness,
which nature shews above her breeding, and
many other evidences, proclaim her with all certainty
to be the king's daughter.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Paulina,</HI> for you have lost a sight, which
was to be seen—cannot be spoken of. There might
you have beheld one joy crown another, so, and in
such a manner, that it seem'd sorrow wept to take
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
leave of 'em, for their joy waded in tears: there was
casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with coun∣tenance
of such distraction, that they were to be
known by garment, not by favour. <HI>Sicily,</HI> being
ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
daughter, lifted the princess from the earth, and so
lock'd her in embracing, as if he wou'd pin her to
his heart, that she might no more be in danger of
losing: then, as if that joy had now become a loss,
cries—Oh, thy mother! thy mother! now he thanks
the <HI>Old Shepherd,</HI> who stands by like a weather-bea∣ten
conduit of many kings reigns; then asks <HI>Bohe∣mia</HI>
forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then
again worries his daughter with clipping her.—I ne∣ver
heard of such another encounter, which lames re∣port
to follow it, and undoes description to draw it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which
angled for my eyes, was, at the relation of the
queen's death, with the manner how she came by
it (bravely confess'd and lamented by the king); how
attentiveness wounded his daughter, 'till from one
sign of dolor to another, she did with an, <HI>Alas!</HI>
I wou'd fain say, bleed tears—I am sure my heart
wept blood. Who was most marble, there chang'd
colour; some swooned, all sorrow'd; if the world
cou'd have seen't, the woe had been universal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they return'd to court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet. They were proceeding with due cere∣mony,
amid the clamorous joy of the multitude,
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
when I took advantage of their delay, to recount to
you this rhapsody of wonders.</P>

<P><HI>Camillo,</HI> haste thee; this royal assembly is entring
now the city. Haste thee, with <HI>Paulina</HI>'s greeting to
the double majesty, and our new found princess; give
them to know I have in my keeping a statue of <HI>Her∣mione,</HI>
perform'd by the most rare master of <HI>Italy;</HI> who,
had he himself eternity, and cou'd put breath into this
work, wou'd beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly
he is her ape. He, so near to <HI>Hermione,</HI> has done <HI>Her∣mione,</HI>
that they will speak to her, and stand in hope of
answer. Invite them to the sight of it, put thy mes∣sage
into what circumstance of compliment the time
and sudden occasion may admit, and return with
best speed to prepare for their unprovided entertain∣ment.</P>

<P>So you have; but I was a gentleman born before

my father, brother; and then, the prince, my bro∣ther,

wept; and there was the first gentlemanlike tears

<L>My measure up of bliss—tell me, mine own,</L>
<L>Where hast thou been preserv'd? where liv'd! how
found</L>
<L><HI>Bohemia</HI>'s court? for thou shalt hear, that I</L>
<L>Knowing, by <HI>Paulina,</HI> that the oracle</L>
<L>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv'd</L>
<L>Myself to see the issue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>There's time enough</L>
<L>For that, and many matters more of strange</L>
<L>Import—how the queen escap'd from <HI>Sicily,</HI></L>
<L>Retir'd with me, and veil'd her from the world—</L>
<L>But at this time no more; go, go together,</L>
<L>Ye precious winners all, your exultation</L>
<L>Pertake to ev'ry one; I, an old turtle,</L>
<L>Will wing me to some wither'd bough, and there</L>
<L>My mate, that's never to be found again,</L>
<L>Lament 'till I am lost.</L>

<L>No, no, <HI>Paulina;</HI></L>
<L>Live bless'd with blessing others—my <HI>Polixenes!</HI></L>
<STAGE>[<HI>Presenting</HI> Polixenes <HI>to</HI> Hermione.</STAGE>
<L>What? look upon my brother: both your pardons,</L>
<L>That e'er I put between your holy looks</L>
<L>My ill suspicion—come, our good <HI>Camillo,</HI></L>
<L>Now pay thy duty here—thy worth and honesty</L>
<L>Are richly noted, and here justified</L>
<L>By us a pair of kings; and last, my queen,</L>

<SPEAKER>PERDITA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am all shame.</L>
<L>And ignorance itself, how to put on</L>
<L>This novel garment of gentility,</L>
<L>And yield a patch'd behaviour, between</L>
<L>My country-level, and my present fortunes,</L>
<L>That ill becomes this presence. I shall learn,</L>
<L>I trust I shall with meekness—but I feel,</L>
<L>(Ah happy that I do) a love, an heart</L>
<L>Unalter'd to my prince, my <HI>Florizel.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIZEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be still my queen of <HI>May,</HI> my shepherdess,</L>
<L>Rule in my heart; my wishes be thy subjects,</L>
<L>And harmless as thy sheep.</L>

<SPEAKER>LEONTES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now, good <HI>Paulina,</HI></L>
<L>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</L>
<L>Each one demand, and answer to his part</L>
<L>Perform'd in this wide gap of time, since first</L>
<L>We were dissever'd—then thank the righteous gods,</L>
<L>Who, after tossing in a perilous sea,</L>
<L>Guide us to port, and a kind beam display,</L>
<L>To gild the happy evening of our day.</L>
