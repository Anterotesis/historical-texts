<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Tell you, Sir, his love to me is all a pretence: it is amazing that you, who are so acute, so quick in dis∣cerning on other occasions, should be so blind upon this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where are your proofs, Charlot? What signifies your opening matters which your evi∣dence cannot support?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Sir, strong circumstances in every court should have weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they have collaterally, child, that is by way as it were of corroboration, or where matters are doubtful; <Q>then indeed, as Plowden wisely, ob∣serves “Les circonstances ajout beaucoup de∣poids aux faits.”</Q>—You understand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not perfectly well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to explain by case in point; A, we will suppose, my dear, robs B of a watch upon Hounslow heath—dy'e mind, child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A, is taken up and indicted; B swears posi∣tively to the idenity of A.—Dy'e observe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attentively.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what does me A, but sets up the alibi C, to defeat the affidavit of B.—You take me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you see then the ballance is even.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then to turn the scale, child, against A, in favour of B, they produce the circumstance D, viz. B's watch found in the pocket of A; upon
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
which, the testimony of C being contradicted by B,—no, by D,—why then A, that is to say C,—no D,—joining B, they convict C,—no, no, A,—against the affidavit of C.—So this being pretty clear, child, I leave the application to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very obliging, Sir. But suppose now, Sir, it should appear that the attention of Sir Luke Limp is directed to some other object, would not that induce you to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Other object! Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this very house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here! why the girl is non compos; there's nobody here, child, but a parcel of Abigals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, one person else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But remember, Sir, my accusation is confined to Sir Luke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose then, Sir, those powerful charms which made a conquest of you, may have ex∣tended their empire over the heart of Sir Luke?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, hussy, you don't hint at your mother-in-law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, but I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; why this is point blank treason against my sovereign authority: but can you, Charlot, bring proof of any overt acts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT</SPEAKER>
<P>Overt acts!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; that is any declaration by writing, or even word of mouth is sufficient; then let 'em demur if they dare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that, Sir; but another organ has been pretty explicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In those cases a very infallible one—the eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! nonsense and stuff.—The eye!—The eye has no authority in a court of law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, Sir; but it is a decisive evidence in a court of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark you, hussy, why you would not file an information against the virtue of madam your mother; you would not insinuate that she has been guilty of crim. con.?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you mistake me; it is not the lady, but the gentleman I am about to impeach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, Charlot! I see on what ground your action is founded—jealousy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were never more deceiv'd in your life; for it is impossible, my dear Sir, that jealousy can subsist without love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from that passion (thank heaven) I am pretty free at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sweet object to excite tender desires!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, hussy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>First as to his years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, Sir, age procures honor, but I believe it is very rarely productive of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And tho' the loss of a leg can't be imputed to Sir Luke Limp as a fault—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, at least you will allow it a misfor∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty thing truly, for a girl, at my time of life, to be ty'd to a man with one foot in the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>One foot in the grave! the rest of his body is not a whit the nearer for that.—There has been only an execution issued against part of his per∣sonals, his real estate is unencumbered and free—besides, you see he does not mind it a whit, but is as alert, and as merry, as a defendant after non-suiting a plaintiff for omitting an S.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir! I know how proud Sir Luke is of his leg, and have often heard him declare, that he would not change his bit of timber for the best flesh and bone in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a hero for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, sustaining unavoidable evils with constancy is a certain sign of greatness of mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then to derive a vanity from a misfortune, will not I'm afraid be admitted as a vast instance of wisdom, and indeed looks as if the man had nothing better to distinguish himself by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does that follow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>By inunendo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Negatur.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Sir, I have other proofs of your he∣ro's vanity, not inferior to that I have mention'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cite them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The paltry ambition of levying and following titles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Titles! I don't understand you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean the poverty of fastening in public upon men of distinction, for no other reason but be∣cause
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
of their rank; adhering to Sir John till the Baronet is superceded by my Lord; quitting the puny Peer for an Earl; and sacrificing all three to a Duke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keeping good company! a laudable ambition!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, if the virtues that procur'd the father a peerage, could with that be entail'd on the son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, hussy—there are severe laws against speaking evil of dignities.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scandalum magnatum is a statute must not be trifled with: why you are not one of those vulgar sluts that think a man the worse for being a Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; I am contented with only, not think∣ing him the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all this, I believe, hussy, a right honour∣able proposal would soon make you alter your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unless the proposer had other qualities than what he possesses by patent. Besides, Sir, you know Sir Luke is a devotee to the bottle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a whit the less honest for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It occasions one evil at least; that when under its influence, he generally reveals all, sometimes more than he knows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proofs of an open temper, you baggage: but, come, come, all these are but trifling objections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, Sir, they prove the object a trifle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you pert jade, do you play on my words? I say Sir Luke is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody! how the deuce do you make that out?—He is neither person attained or out∣law'd, may in any of his majesty's courts sue or be sued, appear by attorney, or in propria persona, can acquire, buy, procure, purchase, possess, and inherit, not only personalities, such as goods, and chattels, but even realities, as all lands, tenements, and hereditaments, what∣soever, and wheresoever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, further child, he may sell, give, be∣stow, bequeath, devise, demise, lease, or to farm lett, ditto lands, to any person whomsoever—and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, Sir; but there are notwith∣standing in this town a great number of nobo¦dies, not described by lord Coke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is your next-door neighbour, Sir Har∣ry Hen, an absolute blank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Mrs. Pert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir! a man who is not suffer'd to hear, see, smell, or in short to enjoy the free use of any one of his senses; who, instead of having a po∣sitive will of his own, is deny'd even a paltry ne∣gative; who can neither resolve or reply, consent or deny, without first obtaining the leave of his lady: an absolute monarch to sink into the sneaking state of being a slave to one of his sub∣jects—Oh fye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, Sir Harry Hen, is as I may say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody Sir, in the fullest sense of the word—Then your client Lord Solo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday!—Why you would not annihilate a peer of the realm, with a prodigious estate and an allow'd judge too of the elegant arts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, I am no stranger to that noble man's attributes; but then, Sir, please to consi∣der, his power as a peer he gives up to a proxy; the direction of his estate, to a rapacious, artful attorney: and as to his skill in the elegant arts, I presume you confine them to painting and music, he is directed in the first by Mynheer Van Eisel, a Dutch dauber; and in the last is but the echo of Signora Florenza, his lord∣ship's mistress and an opera singer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy upon us! at what a rate the jade runs!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, Sir, I define every individual who, ceasing to act for himself, becomes the tool, the mere engine of another man's will, to be nothing more than a cypher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this rate the jade will half unpeople the world: but what is all this to Sir Luke? to him, not one of your cases apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one—Sir Luke has not a first princi∣ple in his whole composition; not only his plea∣sures, but even his passions are prompted by others; and he is as much directed to the ob∣jects of his love and his hatred, as in his eating, drinking, and dressing. Nay, though he is active, and eternally busy, yet his own private affairs are neglected; and he would not scruple to break an appointment that was to determine a considerable part of his property, in order to
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
exchange a couple of hounds for a lord, or to buy a pad-nag for a lady. In a word—but he's at hand, and will explain himself best; I hear his stump on the stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will preserve a little decency be∣fore your lover at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lover! ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir LUKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Serjeant, your slave—Ah! are you there my little—O Lord! Miss, let me tell you something for fear of forgetting—Do you know that you are new christen'd, and have had me for a gossip?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christen'd! I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir LUKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then lend me your ear—Why last night, as Colonel Kill'em, Sir William Weezy, Lord Fre∣derick Foretop, and I were carelessly sliding the Ranelagh round, picking our teeth, after a damn'd muzzy dinner at Boodle's, who should trip by but an abbess, well known about town, with a smart little nun in her suite. Says Weezy (who, between ourselves, is as husky as hell) Who is that? odds flesh, she's a delicate wench! Zounds! cried Lord Frederick, where can Weezy have been, not to have seen the Harietta before? for you must know Frederick is a bit of Macaroni, and adores the soft Italian termi∣nation in <HI>a.</HI></P>

<P>He does?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir LUKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a delitanti all over.—Before? replied Weezy; crush me if ever I saw any thing half so handsome before!—No! replied I in an in∣stant; Colonel, what will Weezy say when he sees the Charlotta?—Hey! you little—</P>

<P>Peace, puppy; well Mr. Fairplay, leave the papers a little longer with me and—pray who is employ'd against you?</P>

<P>Fieri Facias from Fetter-lane, about the bill to be filed by Kit Crape against Will Vizard, this term.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange world we live in, that even highway∣men can't be true to each other! <STAGE>[half aside to himself.]</STAGE> but we shall make master Vizard re∣fund, we'll shew him what long hands the law has.</P>

<P>Facias says, that in all the books he can't hit on a precedent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then I'll make one myself; <HI>aut inveniam, aut faciam,</HI> has been always my motto. The charge must be made for partnership-profit, by bar∣tering lead and gunpowder, against money, watches, and rings, on Epping-forest, Houn∣slow-heath, and other parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>The declaration too is deliver'd in the cause of Roger Rapp'em against Sir Solomon Simple.</P>

<P>What, the affair of the note?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he is clear that his client never gave such a note.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Defendant never saw plaintiff since the hour he was born; but, notwithstanding, they have
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
three witnesses to prove a consideration, and signing the note.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is puzzled what plea to put in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Three</HI> witnesses ready, you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him Simple must acknowledge the note, <STAGE>[Jack <HI>starts]</HI></STAGE> and bid him, against the trial comes on, to procure <HI>four</HI> persons at least to prove the payment, at the Crown and Anchor, the 10th of December.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then how comes the note to remain in plaintiff's possession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well put, Jack; but we have a <HI>salvo</HI> for that; plaintiff happen'd not to have the note in his pocket, but promis'd to deliver it up, when call'd thereunto by defendant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will do rarely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the defence be a secret, for I see we have able people to deal with. But come, child, not to lose time, have you carefully conn'd those instructions I gave you?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that we shall see. How many points are the great object of practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first is to put a man into possession of what is his right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The second?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either to deprive a man of what is <HI>really</HI> his right, or to keep him as long as possible <HI>out</HI> of possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good boy! To gain the last end, what are the best means to be us'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Various and many are the legal modes of de∣lay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Injunctions, demurrers, sham-pleas, writs of error, rejoinders, sur-rejoinders, rebutters, sur∣rebutters, replications, exceptions, essoigns, and imparlance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[To himself.]</STAGE>
<P>Fine instruments in the hands of a man, who knows how to use them.—But now, Jack, we come to the point: if an able ad∣vocate has his choice in a cause, (which if he is in reputation he may readily have,) which side should he choose, the right, or the wrong?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great lawyer's business, is always to make choice of the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And prythee why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because a good cause can speak for itself, whilst a bad one demands an able counsellor to give it a colour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. But in what respects will this an∣swer to the lawyer himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a two-fold way; firstly, his fees will be large in proportion to the dirty work he is to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>His reputation will rise, by obtaining the vic∣tory in a desperate cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, boy.—Are you ready in the case of the cow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give it then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>First of April, anno seventeen hundred and blank, John a Nokes was indicted by blank, before blank, in the county of blank, for steal∣ing a cow, contra pacem etcet.—and against the statute in that case provided and made, to pre∣vent stealing of cattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Said Nokes was convicted upon the said statute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What follow'd upon?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Motion in arrest of judgment, made by coun∣sellor Puzzle. First, Because the field from whence the cow was convey'd is laid in the in∣dictment as <HI>round,</HI> but turn'd out upon proof to be <HI>square.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well: a valid objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, Because in said indictment the co∣lour of the cow is called red, there being no such things in rerum natura as red cows, no more than black lions, spread eagles, flying griffins, or blue boars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well put.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thirdly, said Nokes has not offended against form of the statute; because stealing of <HI>cattle</HI> is there provided against: whereas we are only convicted of stealing a <HI>cow.</HI> Now, though cat∣tle may be cows, yet it does by no means follow that cows must be cattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo, bravo! buss me, you rogue; you are your father's own son! go on, and prosper.—I am sorry, dear Jack, I must leave thee. If Providence but sends thee life and health, I pro∣phesy, thou wilt wrest as much land from the

owners, and save as many thieves from the gal∣lows, as any practitioner since the days of king Alfred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll do my endeavour. <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Serjeant.</STAGE> So!—father is set off. Now if I can but lay eyes on our Charlot, just to deliver this letter, before madam comes home. There she is.—Hist, sister Charlot!</P>

<P>No, sister, I'm sure you won't be so cross. Besides, what could I do? The poor young lad begg'd so hard; and there for this fort∣night he has gone about sighing, and musing, and moping: I am satisfied it would melt you to see him. Do, sister, let me bring him this evening, now father is out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word!—The young man has made no bad choice of an agent; you are for push∣ing matters at once.—But harkee, Sir, who is this spark you are so anxious about? And how long have you known him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a prodigious long while: above a month I am certain. Don't you think him mighty genteel? I assure you he is vastly lik'd by the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed. Mrs. Congo, at the Grecian coffee-house, says, he's the soberest youth that comes to the house; and all Mrs. Mittens's 'prentices throw down their work, and run to the window every time he goes by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And moreover, besides that, he has several great estates in the country; but only for the present, he is kept out of 'em all by the owners.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Jack! that's the worst part of the story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>JACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! that's nothing at all. His guardian, Mr. Fairplay, has been with father to-day, and says, he is certain that he can set all to rights in a trice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jack, when that point is determin'd, it will be time enough to—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you. Either Cupid's darts were al∣ways but poetical engines, or they have been lately depriv'd of their points. Love holds no place in the modern bills of mortality. How∣ever, Jack, you may tell your friend, that I have observ'd his frequent walks in our street.</P>

<P>But stop. To be regular, and provide for fresh causes, we must take no notice of the bo∣rough and lands, the real objects in view, but stick fast to the tree, which is of no import∣ance at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>True, true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir LUKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Circuit, you may proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CIRCUIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury.—I am in this cause counsel for Hobson, the plaintiff.—The action is brought against Nebuchadonezer Nobson, That he the said Nobson did cut down a tree, value two-pence, and to his own use said tree did convert.—Nobson justifies, and claims tree as his tree. We will, gentlemen, first state the probable evidence, and then come to the posi∣tive: and first as to the probable.—When was this tree here belonging to Hobson, and claim'd by Nobson, cut down? Was it cut down pub∣licly in the day, in the face of the sun, men, women, and children, all the world looking on?—No; it was cut down privately, in the night, in a dark night, nobody <HI>did</HI> see, no∣body <HI>could</HI> see.—Hum—And then with respect and regard to this tree, I am instructed to say, gentlemen, it was a beautiful, an ornamental tree to the spot where it grew. Now can it be thought that any man would come for to go in the middle of the night, nobody seeing, no∣body <HI>did</HI> see, nobody <HI>could</HI> see, and cut down a tree, which tree was an ornamental tree, if tree had been his tree?—Certainly no.—And again, gentlemen, we moreover insist, that this
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
tree was not only ornamental to the spot where it grew, but it was a useful tree to the owner: it was a plumb-tree, and not only a plum-tree, but I am authoriz'd to say the best of plum-trees, it was a damsin plum.—Now can it be thought, that any man wou'd come for to go, in the middle of the night, nobody see∣ing, nobody <HI>did</HI> see, nobody <HI>could</HI> see, and cut down a tree; which tree was not only an orna∣mental tree, but a useful tree; and not only a useful tree, but a plum-tree; and not only a plum-tree, but the best of plum-trees, a dam∣sin plum? Most assuredly no.—If so be then, that this be so, and so it most certainly is, I ap∣prehend no doubt will remain with the court, but my client a verdict will have, with full costs of suits, in such a manner and so forth, as may nevertheless appear notwithstanding.</P>

And then as to this beautiful tree, with which Mr. Serjeant has ornamented his spot—No, gentle∣men, no such matter at all; I am instructed to say quite the reverse; a stunted tree, a blighted, blasted tree; a tree not only limbless, and leaf∣less, but very near lifeless; that was the true state of the tree: and then as to its use, we own it was a plum-tree indeed, but not of the kind Mr. Serjeant sets forth, a damsin plum; our proofs say loudly a bull plum; but if so be and it had been a damsin plum, will any man go for to say, that a damsin plum is the
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
best kind of plum; not a whit, I take upon me to say it is not a noun substantive plum—with plenty of sugar it does pretty well indeed in a tart, but to eat it by itself, will Mr. Serjeant go to compare it with the queen mother, the padrigons—</P>
