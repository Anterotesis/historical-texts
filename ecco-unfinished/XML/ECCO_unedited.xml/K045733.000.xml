<HEAD>SOME PARTICULARS OF <HI>THE LIFE</HI> OF THE LATE GEORGE COLMAN, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Richmond,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec. 4th,</HI> 1787.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FOR some years past I have entertained an idea of leaving behind me some particulars of my life, which I flattered myself might not be quite uninteresting, or unentertaining; or at least prove more sa∣tisfactory than the anecdotes retailed by some chance biographer, who might per∣haps be induced to confer on me the honours that have lately been as liberally bestowed on persons of as little importance. Much business, much illness, and perhaps
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
some idleness, have from time to time pro∣tracted my commencement of the work, and thinking it not impossible, nor indeed improbable, that the same causes may still prevail, so as at least to hinder the com∣pletion of it, I now sit down to give an account of some circumstances, touching what has been commonly supposed to be the leading feature in my character; but in which the world has been most grossly deceived, and mistaken, as the following narration and documents will sufficiently testify.</P>
<P>It has, I know, long been taken for granted, that such was the strength of my predilection for theatrical possessions, that I would in spite of all competition, and with∣out hesitation, forego all other expecta∣tions, however magnificent or alluring; and that at a certain aera of my life, about
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
twenty years ago, this position was most fully verified.</P>
<P>Nothing but my respect and gratitude for the memory of those, from whose bounty I still derive a considerable part of my income, determined me to abide and patiently endure the contempt and obloquy that such a received opinion brought upon me, lest by vindicating myself from cause∣less slander, I might appear willing to throw a stain on those who had done much for me, merely because they had not done more.</P>
<P>This opinion of my character has been chiefly founded on two propositions, both of which, with as much delicacy as the truth will admit, I shall shew to be ground∣less.</P>
<P>The first of these propositions is, that by my literary pursuits, and dramatic com∣positions,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
I lost the favour and affection of the Earl of BATH.</P>
<P>The second is, that by my purchase of a fourth of the patent of Covent Garden theatre, I knowingly and voluntarily for∣feited the intended bequest of the Newport estate under the will of General PUL∣TENEY.</P>
<P>That I had an early taste and relish for polite literature, and particularly for com∣positions of the stage, is most true; nor will I pretend to deny that I was betrayed into youthful follies and irregularities, which involved me in temporary incon∣veniencies and distresses. To extricate myself from the embarrassments that those follies, ill suited to narrow circumstances, brought upon me, I had recourse to my pen, which was then rarely used, drama∣tically,
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
or otherwise, but with a view to profit: the Earl of BATH, however, was so little displeased with these efforts, that he even countenanced and encouraged them, and often deigned to consider them as the earnest of something better that was to follow. So dear, indeed, did he hold me, that he has not only in words and in writing told me that he considered me as his second son, but, in several wills and testaments executed during that period, and during the life of my dear friend and kinsman, Lord PULTENEY, absolutely testified that he regarded me in that light; nor did any of my theatrical productions abate his affection, or in the least tend to alter his intentions. A more fatal event was the cause of such alterations; I mean the early and unexpected death of Lord PULTENEY. From that moment he new modelled his will, in which he still made
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
a handsome provision for me, but left it to the discretion of General PULTENEY to consign, or not consign to me the estate, which he had, in many preceding wills, absolutely devised to me, in case of the death of his only son, Lord PULTENEY.</P>
<P>The little that has been already said on this subject, is, perhaps, more than suffici∣ent to resute the charge contained in the first proposition; but it may not be amiss to speak of one or two circumstances, be∣fore we entirely dismiss it. I have men∣tioned, that Lord BATH considered me as his second son; and, indeed, his avowed partiality for me, induced many persons, not intimately acquainted with the history and connections of the family, to think me really so, and of consequence to report it as a fact. Not to dwell on the grossness of the supposition, implying a criminal in∣tercourse
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
between his lordship and his wife's sister, there were certain physical impossibilities in the case. My mother went over to my father, who was resident at Florence, sour or five years before I was born. Mr. PULTENEY and his family were in England; I had a sister born there two years before me, so that neither of us, na∣tives of Florence, could derive our origin from my mother's brother in law, consi∣dering the unfortunate intervention of the Alps and the Mediterranean. We had, in∣deed, each of us, the honour of a royal godfather and godmother, as children of a British plenipotentiary, from whom we took our several names of GEORGE and CAROLINE.</P>
<P>The other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cumstances referred to above, come closer to the point in ques∣tion, and, indeed, form a necessary chain
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
in the succeeding narrative; and it gives me no small satisfaction to be able to seize this opportunity of paying a due tribute of affection and respect to a most ingeni∣ous, learned, and worthy man. The story will speak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h clogium. The man I mean was my most esteemed and honoured friend the late Mr. BOOTH of Lincoln's Inn.</P>
<P>It was Mr. BOOTH who first acquaint∣ed me, very soon after the irretrievable loss of poor Lord PULTENEY, of the new arrangements of Lord BATH'S affairs. His lordship, however, says he, assures me he has taken care of you; but that care, I dare say, will be very unequal to his ori∣ginal intentions. The world supposes, that the death of LORD PULTENEY is a great event in your fortune. You and I know the contrary; and if you have a mind, I will still endeavour to enable you
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
to make your fortune another way. Though you are my neighbour in Lin∣coln's Inn, and have your chambers in the next stair-case to mine, yet I believe you have not hitherto thought of the law so seriously as I have done. If you have talents for the bar, you may make much more money than ever I have made; my reli∣gion has prevented my appearance there; yet my gains have not been inconsidera∣ble, though less than what they have been rated. If you do <HI>not</HI> attend the bar, still the law is no mean resource. I will, if you please, give you a plan of study; I will shew you every case I ever answered, and explain to you the principles on which I founded my opinions. <HI>My life is wearing; and as I go out of business, I will make it a point to bring you into it.</HI></P>
<P>This was the substance of what this good friend said to me on this occasion. I
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
have every where endeavoured to clothe the matter as near as possible in his own expressions, and to the last words I could almost venture to swear.</P>
<P>Though he had for some time shewed me many civilities, and even marks of friend∣ship, yet I must confess that this touching instance of it almost overcame me.</P>
<P>Penetrated with his kindness, and struck with the nicety of my situation, I seriously determined to avail myself of his most friendly offer, and to follow his advice. Lord BATH, to the day of his death, con∣tinued his favour and protection to me. I entered his house as familiarly as my own chambers, and occupied without invita∣tion a place at his table.</P>
<P>On his death, his brother, General PUL∣TENEY, received me as a friend, and gave
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
me to understand that I was <HI>un enfant de famille,</HI> that must not be overlooked or neglected. He told me, that he supposed I should no longer think of the profession to which I had been destined, and made me a present of his chariot. Such a call <HI>from</HI> the bar was too tempting to be re∣sisted, and I accordingly quitted my tye wig, gown, and band, and my chambers at Lincoln's Inn.</P>
<P>I did not, however, roll long in the ge∣neral's carriage without some rather disa∣greeable jolts in it. Malice soon began her operations, and endeavoured to preju∣dice him against me; yet he continued my friend, and in answer to a letter to him at Tunbridge, (of which I have no copy) he returned me the following comfortable epistle.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dean COLMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I esteem you very much for your ac∣knowledgment and grateful sense of poor Lord BATH'S affection and kindness to you, which has urged you at present (in writing to me,) to express yourself (with the overflowings of an honest heart) in so very obliging a manner, that if I had no other motive, it would be sufficient to make me love you with great cordiality and kindness to my life's end; but I will over and above assure you, that I have ever loved you, and am persuaded that nothing will alter my affection and opinion of your deserving from me all the good that Lord BATH has visibly designed and wished you to enjoy; all that can be said further, must be superfluous and un∣necessary; but, let me add, that I shall always be glad of a visit from you: the reason that after the eleventh was menti∣oned
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
to you for coming here, was from an engagement about that time to the Bishop of ROCHESTER, and would be an hin∣drance to your being at the same time with me, as my house would be quite full; but as he makes no longer a stay than a day or two, you then may take your own time and conveniency of obliging me with your company; being,</P>

<P>The publication of private letters I have ever thought exceptionable, unless some very particular circumstances render it proper and necessary to produce them. In the present instance, I do not see how I can otherwise vindicate my character; and
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
therefore I trust that my memory will not be loaded with reproach, merely for an act of self justification.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more open and direct than the contents of the above letter; yet some subsequent events, too strong not to be noticed, but yet too minute to be re∣capitulated, made me conceive it more than barely possible that the General would on some pretence, render void his most ex∣plicit and voluntary declaration. Under this persuasion I thought it advisable to secure to myself, is possible, some advan∣tages more solid and permanent, than an annuity which was to vanish with my life, and might render it impossible for me to provide for any surivor,</P>
<P>At this critical time, an offer was made me of a share in Covent Garden theatre, and I had before had the refusal of Mr.
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
GARRICK'S share at Drury Lane. Still, however, I did not enter hastily into these undertakings, without attention to the assu∣rances I had received, and which were now put to the test. In March 1767, I signed an agreement with my friend POWELL, and the other intended purchasers of Covent Garden theatre, under a penalty of three thousand pounds, in case of non-perform∣ance. I afterwards went to Bath, where I received a letter from General PULTENEY, in answer to one of mine, of which I have no copy, but of which the substance may be collected from his answer, and my re∣ply.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear COLMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received your letter from Bath, which surprises me not a little, to find in your letters the same jealousy and reproach
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
as I met with the last year, from Bath, which were, as I told you then, falsely grounded from malice and curiosity, and now again I am the more convinced of it, for I declare to you, that I never gave any cause, to any one whatsoever, that from any report in your disfavour that I had the least thought of paying any regard to it, nor indeed have any persons, by mis∣representing you, ever taken that liberty to speak of you disadvantageously; for it is well known the veneration I have for every thing Lord BATH has recommend∣ed, and I will assure you over and above, that I have a long rooted disposition in me to befriend you in all things; yet I can see some things that are not greatly pleas∣ing, as most certainly the letter which you speak of was rather too ludicrous to be writ to an old gentleman, and your friend, which I found fault with, and I did not
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
expect to find it justified, by urging that I went to counsell in disaproving of it, for I think the impropriety of it, would have been disaproved off by a weaker judgem<SUP>t</SUP>. Y<SUP>r</SUP> jealousy about your connection may be founded with reason, but however that may appear to the world, and may give me a concern, I had not deviated from my own good will, nor from L<SUP>d</SUP> BATH'S inten∣tion. I have thus far explained my affec∣tion to you this once; but I hope you will give no farther attention to the malice or curiosity of Bath acquaintance, but to dis∣regard them, as I shall do, if it continues; but otherwise, rest assured y<SUP>t</SUP> I am inclined and very desirous of being always, your faithful</P>

<P>Please to accept my warmest acknow∣ledgments of your kind letter, and give me leave to assure you that I shall ever entertain the most lively sense of your goodness to me on this and every other occasion. The sole meaning of my last was to acquit myself of disrespect or ingra∣titude: I was conscious that I had never consulted lawyers on the subject there mentioned, which I understood had been insinuated to you, and I thought myself bound in duty to you to wipe off the re∣proach that such an imputation carried with it.</P>

<P>From this reply it is evident that the General misunderstood what I had said in my first letter, concerning the consulta∣tion of counsel; yet my unhappy attempts
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
at raillery and pleasantry, always so well received by Lord BATH, were rather in∣judiciously directed to his brother, and my inexperience and want of due knowledge of the world, must be my only apology. It is likely too, that I might be more anxious than ordinary, from a sense of the coven∣ant I had recently, and, perhaps, too hastily entered into, just before I left London. And before my return from Bath, early in May, the expected revolution in the state of Covent Garden had become a subject of public conversation, and of course furnish∣ed materials for sundry paragraphs in the news papers. I waited immediately on General PULTENEY, who received me as cordially as ever. We had a full and free conversation on the subject. He expressed neither warmth nor anger on the occasion; but on the whole seemed rather to disap∣prove of the undertaking. In consequence
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
of which, the following letters past be∣tween us.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is almost impossible to conceive or ex∣press the uneasiness I have suffered since my return from Bath. The late alteration in my circumstances was of itself sufficient to make me very indifferent about the en∣gagements I had entered into, whatever advantages they might promise; but the hint you gave me of your disapprobation of them, made me earnestly endeavour to extricate myself. The difficulties that at∣tended those endeavours have only served to add to my uneasiness; but it is now confidently said, that other bidders will ap∣pear, and this, or some other unforeseen circumstance will, I hope, still defeat the purchase; if not, I have no resource but to break through my engagement, and sub∣mit
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
to a penalty of three thousand pounds. Judge then of the distraction of my mind, between the fear of displeasing you, and so disagreeable an alternative.</P>
<P>I will not say any thing in vindication of the undertaking. It seems to be disagree∣able to you, and that is enough to make me repent of having thought of it. Before it was proposed to me, I knew that Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT was the original proprietor of this very patent; that Sir RICHARD STEELE had received from the Crown a favour of the same nature; that Sir JOHN VANBURGH not only built the theatre in the Hay-market, but was actually engaged in the management of it, as well as Mr. CONGREVE in that of Lincoln's Inn Fields; not to mention several gentle∣men now living of rank and fortune supe∣rior to my own, who had formed the like
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
intentions; so that I really did not think of bringing any reflections on myself, or those who had honoured me with their countenance and protection. Any thing that might carry the slightest appearance of disrespect to you was the farthest from my thoughts, and I cannot but be misera∣ble while I suppose myself liable even to the suspicion of it. As to my precipita∣tion in this affair, I feel the consequences of it but too sensibly.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I left London on Saturday, I fully intended to ride to town this morn∣ing in order to pay my respects to you be∣fore you set out for Tunbridge, but hav∣ing been seized with a little feverish disorder last night, I am advised not to stir out to day, which reduces me to this method of sending you my best wishes for your good
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
journey, and your receiving all possible benefit from the waters.</P>
<P>The affair of Covent Garden must now very soon be determined; and, let it turn out which way it will, I shall ever retain the most grateful sense of your kindness on this occasion. Knowing your senti∣ments, I had rather not embark in it; but, should I be driven into it against my incli∣nation, I have still the consolation of reflect∣ing that my sincere respect for you induced me to offer not only to forego all lucrative views in it, but to submit to a penalty that would have swallowed almost the whole of my little fortune; and that you, with the same spirit of generosity that you have ever exerted towards me, declined such a sacrifice, and reconciled me to myself
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
by assuring me of the continuance of your friendship, the loss of which I should feel as the heaviest misfortune that could befall me.</P>
<P>I beg my best respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. BURRARD, to whom I wish every pleasure and benefit that Tunbridge can afford, and I remain, with the truest attachment,</P>

<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
to you. The other bidders talked so very confidently of advancing upon our price, that, till last Thursday was over, I was never thoroughly per∣suaded that our party would be the real purchasers; and if our opponents had ever produced the money to back their assertions, it would have afforded me an opportunity to recede, which I should most certainly have embraced. As the matter stood, nothing but the penalty could have procured me that opportunity. I hope you will at least be convinced that I have, on all occasions, told you the truth, and that, in this instance, I have acted with due respect to your opinion, since I have been acquainted with it; only availing myself of the kind assurance you were pleased to give me of the continuance of your friendship, without exacting my sub∣mission

<P>In the transcribing the letters of General PULTENEY, the abbreviations, punctua∣tion, and orthography, have been religi∣ously preserved; not from any desire of noting any peculiarities, but merely to mark the strict exactness of the copies. The originals are deposited with my exe∣cutors, who I hope will as speedily as pos∣sible, after entering on the office they have kindly taken upon them, lay these sheets before the public.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31"/>
From these letters, and my answers, of which the rough draughts are also left with my executors, I think will most evi∣dently appear the falsehood and absurdity of the second proposition. I shewed the General's letter of June 10<SUP>th</SUP>, in answer to mine of the 7<SUP>th</SUP>, to several friends, GAR∣RICK in particular, who all congratulated me on the contents. Truth, however, obliges me to mention, that honest JOSHUA PEELE, a chancery solicitor, long employed and deservedly esteemed by the family, waiting on General PUL∣TENEY on business, soon after his return from Tunbridge, the General said to him "So, COLMAN has got the playhouse at last;" "Yes, says honest PEELE, (who had seen the General's letter) but I am glad to find that you will not cease to be
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
his friend;" "No, replied the General, I will not cease to be his friend, but I will not be <HI>so much</HI> his friend." The General had certainly a right to say and do as he pleased; but it might, perhaps, not un∣reasonably have been expected that he would have said thus much in his answer to my letter of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> June, an answer written scarce three weeks before the pur∣chase was completed. In that answer, he in few, but strong words, states our long friendship, his leave and consent that I should not incur the penalty of my agree∣ment, and his assurance that he would not cease to be my friend. This assurance, connected with his preceding letters, letters particularly shewing <HI>how</HI> he would be my friend, was surely not to be received as a forerunner to his subsequent conduct. Nor can I conceive that General PULTE∣NEY wrote his letter of the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of June
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
under such an idea. But however that may be, his last will entirely cancelled all that part of Lord BATH's that he had promised to confirm, relative to my suc∣cession to the Newport Estate, which the General commuted for an annuity of four hundred pounds per annum. Soon after General PULTENEY's death, I received a letter from Mr. PULTENEY, which I sub∣join, together with my answer; only for the sake of having an opportunity to de∣clare, that I most intirely acquiesce in the truth of the declarations made in his let∣ter, as well as to testify the sincerity of the sentiments expressed in my answer.</P>

<P>I am very sensible that as Lord BATH <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad named you for Mr. NEWPORT's Es∣tate,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
the change made by General PULTE∣NEY's will, tho' in favour of his right heirs, must have been a great disappoint∣ment to you. I do assure you, that I had not the least knowledge, till the will was read, in what manner the General had set∣tled that estate, or that he had done me the honour to mention my name at all in relation to it; and I further assure you, that I never in my life mentioned you to the General, or did you the smallest preju∣dice with him.</P>
<P>I easily conceive what I myself should feel in your situation, and it will give me great pleasure if by any attentions, or by any good offices in my power, I can con∣tribute in any degree to diminish your re∣gret, which I am sensible it is impossible entirely to remove; and Mrs. PULTENEY,

sorry, I do most solemnly assure you, that I am not in the least disappointed; and if I feel any regret on this occasion, it is out of regard to the memory of the General, as I could have wished he had not taken the needless trouble of ratifying more than once under his hand a promise, which upon reflection he did not think it proper to fulfil. Be that as it may, be assured, Sir, that nobody congratulates you on your good fortune more sincerely than myself.
