<OPENER>Lord Charles Rainsford to Colonel Harcourt.</OPENER>
<P>AH! my friend, may you never have
occasion to practise the philosophy you
preach! Believe me, that charming foun∣dation
for patience and resignation would
vanish at the approach of affliction; “and,
like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave
not a wreck behind.” Those common
precepts suit not the greatness of my loss.
Resignation and a bleeding heart are in∣compatible;
and he who is wounded
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
with a dart like this, must feel too much
to argue. No, my friend, at best your
medicine is but an opiate: it may, for a
time, lull me into insensibility, blunt all
the finer feelings of the soul, but never,
never shall joy resume its abode in this
breaking heart, a heart which shall ever
bear my Delia's image. I go, my friend;
this gay metropolis ill suits my grief: I
fly to Bellmont.</P>
<Q><L>“For, alas! where with her I have stray'd,</L>
<L>I can wander with pleasure alone.”</L></Q>
<P>Pleasure!—Ah, no; pleasure and I,
like childish friendships, were too fond to
continue long inseperable. Oh! I'll in∣dulge
this luxury of grief!</P>
<Q><L>“And to the Nightingale's complaining notes,</L>
<L>Tune my distresses and rehearse my woes.”</L></Q>
<P>The post has just brought me your let∣ter.
Cold, insensible man! you never
loved: a heart so callous could never admit
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
the animating flame. And yet, from the
rectitude of your sentiments, from that
universal benevolence, one should be led
to imagine the refining passion had not al∣ways
been a stranger to your heart; that
heart so feelingly awake to pity, so ready
to relieve the wants of the afflicted. Oh,
come my friend, come to Bellmont, there
we'll enjoy</P>
<Q><L>“The feast of Reason, and the flow of Soul.”</L></Q>
<P>We'll talk of Delia,</P>
<Q><L>“For there's music in the name;</L>
<L>That, softening me to infant tenderness,</L>
<L>Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life.”</L></Q>

<OPENER>Colonel Harcourt to Lord Charles Rainsford.</OPENER>
<Q>“In the Press and will speedily be published,
as a relief for distress'd Macaronies, A COL∣LECTION
OF POEMS FOR THE USE OF
THE FAIR SEX, by Lord <HI>Charles Rains∣ford.”</HI>”</Q>
<P>ON my word, thy last letter was so en∣tirely
poetical, it deserves to be eternally re∣corded
in the annals of gallantry, as a per∣fect
model for the love-lorn throng.</P>
<P>Prithee Rainsford, whence didst thou
borrow those <HI>moving</HI> quotations? And is it
then in rural retirement you hope to con∣quer
this unfortunate passion? But you are
right, my Lord: however unsuccessful
the attempt, you will <HI>there</HI> find fewer
witnesses of your folly. Yet why suffer
your hours to languish in the gloom of
anxiety? Why, with every grace of mind
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and person that can adorn and improve
society, will you fly from man's best joys,
the joys of social and convivial live; and,
to brood o'er one disappointment, give up
all other pleasures? Fie, my Lord, are
you not more inconsistent than the child
who, deprived of the cake it cried for,
refuses all other sustenance?</P>
<P>I called last night on Lady Beverly.
She informs me the two Miss Montforts
spend the winter in London, and make
her house their home; and, as she has
more room than her own family require,
and has just purchased a new carriage, she
shall be very glad to see them. “Besides,”
added she, “I have a great friendship for
poor Mrs. Montfort, which I intend to
demonstrate by receiving her daughters:
and a man of Colonel Harcourts sense
cannot be so ignorant of the manage∣ment
of a family, as not to know that
two young ladies are a great trouble and
expence, and require additional attend∣ants,
and a more elegant table.”</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Sure, Rainsford, this woman is con∣structed
upon a very singular plan. She
moves by clockwork: and yet who can
deny her an unlimited multiplicity of ideas,
since they are bounded but by the garret
and the kitchen, or the most universal
knowledge, of the rise and fall of fashi∣ons,
and of the history of her family?</P>
<P>My intimacy with Harry Montfort re∣quires
that I should pay my respects to his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isters. In the mean time, as soon as I can
dispatch some necessary business, I shall fly
to Bellmont, and expect you will sacrifice
your rivulets and groves to friendship.
Return with me, my dear Rainsford; let
me persuade you to revisit the gay metro∣polis;
and though we cannot abolish pain,
we will endeavour, in the modish circle,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o blunt sensibility.</P>

<OPENER>Miss Montfort to Miss Sedley.</OPENER>
<P>WELL, Fanny, notwithstanding my
aunt Martha's unlucky omens, I am, thanks
to my kind stars, safe in Brook Street.
Would you believe it my friend? No ad∣venture!
A hundred miles from home,
and no adventure! no knights errant!—Positively,
my good aunt, it is true.—In∣deed,
all the <HI>he</HI> creatures I have seen, look
rather as if they had been confined in en∣chanted
castles, for the ladies amusement,
than like the descendents of our warlike
sires; and, instead of storming castles for
our relief, they seem, by their more than
female effeminacy, to throw themselves
upon us for protection. Happily for them,
there now exist no enchanters, or, believe
me, the bravest of our heroes would turn
pale at the sight of a windmill.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Surely, Lucy, Gay had an insight into
futurity when he wrote the Fable of the
Monkey that had seen the world. The
modish world appears peopled by such a
race of animals.</P>
<P>This London is the strangest place!
Such rounds of folly, visiting and cards,
that <HI>Vive'la Bagatelle</HI> is the reigning motto,
and seems banded about from Hyde-park
to White-chapel. And yet, my friend,
so many solemn faces, you would swear
they were in expectation of a general con∣flagration;
and I, the flaming comet, des∣tined
to fire the world.—Don't you think
I improve, Fanny?</P>
<P>A ticket for the ridotto.—Now for hair-dressers,
milleners, and a long train of
etceteras. Lady Beverly (the drollest ori∣ginal)
summons me to the toilet; I fly to
attend the important duties. O, you
would laugh to see your <HI>once</HI> gay friend</P>
<Q><L>“Preside o'er trifles with a solem face.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Though, upon second thoughts, why
need I dress? Surely there can be no oc∣casion;
“for loveliness,” you know, my
dear, “needs not the outward aid of orna∣ment.”
Turning therefore to my sister,
I said, “Lucy, child, go and dress, while
“I obey my friend's commands.”</P>
<P>Believe me, Fanny, that in asking
“What kind of woman is Lady Beverly,”
you could not have put a question more
difficult to be answered.</P>
<P>Lady Beverly delights in a numerous
retinue of servants, and in the elegance of
her table. She is a <HI>mighty good kind of
woman,</HI> and eats, drinks, and sleeps in re∣gular
rotation; but for another passion, it
is not in Lady Beverly you must search for
it. Mistress of a great fortune, which she
knows not how to enjoy, her hours lan∣guish
in insipidity. She beholds her friends
approach and departure with equal indif∣ference.
She goes into public, because
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
she observes others do so; and returns
home, because she is fatigued. Request
charity, and hold out a dignified prece∣dent,
and you may command her purse;
but to afford succour to distress from the
tender motives of humanity, is what she
never knew, In fine, Lady Beverly, with
all that wealth that may attract flatterers,
or, by a right use, command esteem, lives
unadmired, unbeloved; and will die, my
Fanny, unregretted; while none but her
servants can give testimony that such a
woman ever existed.</P>
<P>I fancy you are, ere this, thoroughly
tired of this Lady Beverly, “this fair de∣fect
of nature,” in which, believe me,
you are most heartily joined by</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>From the same to the same.</OPENER>
<P>LOVE! Why, in the name of won∣der,
Fanny, what romance was thy last
study? Believe me, love is an antique
entombed with our grandmothers; and if
our modern pretty fellows ever mention it,
it is for want of other conversation; or,
as they talk of Caesar and Alexander,
merely to shew their reading. However,
my dear friend, let me introduce my fa∣vourite
to you.</P>
<P>Now do not imagine I am going to
trace out the the highly-finished figure of
an Apollo, or the regular graces of an
Adonis. Harcourt's elegance is as much
superior to the dull, inanimate strokes that
mark out beauty, as his wit is above that
to which we are accustomed to give the
name. In short, we must compile a new
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
dictionary, ere I can hope to give you the
least idea of him. By way of attempting it,
try to figure to yourself the God of wit
descending among us, and assuming the
form of Edmond Harcourt.—By this time
I presume your sagacity has led you to
discover,</P>
<Q><L>“Tis not a set of features, or complexion,</L>
<L>The tincture of a skin that I admire.”</L></Q>
<P>To say truth, I have met with people
who tell me Edmond is a perfect <HI>memento
mori;</HI> but to him I can justly apply what
Rollin says of Alcibiades: “There is no
heart so hard, or temper so un∣tractable,
as to hold out against the
charms and graces of his conversation
and intimacy.” Nor does there exist
that being, who views his approach with∣out
transport, or his departure without re∣gret.</P>
<P>His person is tall, very thin, and his
face is remarkable for nothing but a pair
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
of lively black eyes, which are under ex∣cellent
discipline; as they can supply the
place, even of that graceful flow of words
and elegance of expression, which none
besides command. He affects a saucy neg∣ligence
in his person and manners, for the
general run, that renders his attentions,
when he is disposed to bestow them, abso∣lutely
irresistible: and, if I have not yet
secured your esteem for the witty, the ele∣gant,
the engaging Edmond Harcourt,
dare no longer refuse it to the <HI>Man of
Honour.</HI> Yes, my friend, that “Sacred
Tie” has ever bound him: that princi∣ple,
however in the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of others it may
seem but a found, in his breast has proved
itself a reality, a reality as much superior
to that <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> by which many are de∣luded,
as is the sun to the glow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worm.
Actuated by this, his gayeties have still
been pleasures; his munificence, discreti∣tion;
his courage, humanity. What needs
there more to complete my hero, but that
<Q><L>“His generous friendship no cold medium knows;”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
And that, if in our forgiveness of our
enemies, we could lose the sense of the
injuries we have received, Edmond Har∣court
would be as happy as he is de∣serving.</P>
<P>I had a thousand things to tell you, but
have time for no more at present. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER>Sir George Ashby to Captain Bevill.</OPENER>
<P>WELL said, Bevill, and so thou
woudst have thy friend George Ashby sink
into a downright Benedick; and for the
sake of posterity too! On my word, a
mighty unanswerable argument for domes∣ticating
a gay young fellow.</P>
<P>No, no, Frederick, I will level moun∣tains,
raise plantations, and even build
hospitals for posterity; but with the old
man in the Spectator, I should be glad to
see this much talked of posterity, do some∣thing
for me.</P>
<P>Thy last letter, Frederick, spoke the
frigid, cold adviser. And is Captain Bevill
then yet to learn how weak that reason is
which can but point out danger, not teach us
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
to avoid it? Yes, my friend, I obey your
dictates, I reason much—but reason of
Emilia;</P>
<Q><L>“And where <HI>she</HI> is, all reason dies before her.”</L></Q>
<P>I see Lady Harriet, I endeavour to re∣kindle
my extinguished passion; but each
endeavour recoils upon myself, and tells
me it is impossible. True, she is beauti∣ful;
but, my friend, when the Earl wish∣ed
you to marry Lady Mary, did not your
eyes bear testimony to her charms? And
did not you not declare, that meer beauty
might attract your senses, but could not
captivate your heart?——No, Bevill, 'tis
the elegant, the insinuating Emilia, who,
with sewer personal graces, possesses all that
sweet simplicity of thought, all that ten∣der
sensibility of soul, which would make
even ugliness attractive; 'tis she who has
won my heart.</P>
<P>That I once loved Lady Harriet, my
friend, how could it be otherwise? Young,
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
unexperienced, undiscerning, my heart
readily yielded to her charms; and, in
those tender moments of delusion, I gave
that fatal paper, that frantic promise, that
rends my soul.—What do I say? Even
<HI>without</HI> a promise, thy Ashby had been <HI>just.</HI>
Yes, Frederick, this heart can mourn, it
can bleed in fulfilling its engagements; but
it knows not to betray unsuspecting inno∣cence.</P>
<P>Thanks to Lady Waters, (who is on a
visit to my mother) I am more frequently
<HI>tête á tête</HI> with Emilia.—You know my
god-mother—a rough diamond, that needs
but the workman's hand to render it of in∣estimable
value.—Nature, my friend,
may form the jewel, but it is education a∣lone
can give the polish: and how insuffici∣ent
that unadorned virtue to attract admir∣ers,
you, who know Lady Waters, need
not be informed by your</P>

<OPENER>Augustus Richmond, Es{que} to Sir George Asbby.</OPENER>
<P>IT must be confessed, Sir George Ash∣by
does excel all the rest of his sex; not in
elegance of person, in wit and understand∣ing;
(for these, I flatter myself, I may
stand the scrutiny with his worship); but in
the softer virtues of the heart; for the devil
take me, if I should not have sworn at any
girl for a prude, that had penned such a
letter as your last<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter does not appear.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I'll tell you what, George, I have,
thanks to my grandmother, some very fine-looking
books in my library; such as; The
Whole Duty of Man, the Pilgrim's Pro∣gress,
<HI>etcetera;</HI> which, should I want to
read any thing about honour and Consci∣ence,
I had much rather turn to than your
Letters. The Books are only stupid, but
your Letters are—the devil.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
I am actually ashamed to call a man my
friend, to whom it is necessary to recount
the joys of that love, which,</P>
<Q><L>“Free as air, at sight of human ties,</L>
<L>Spreads its light wings, and in a moment flies.”</L></Q>
<P>Carry off Emilia, (in which project my
brains are very much at your service: no
bad offer, let me tell you); then marry
Lady Harriet, and make the best husband
in the world; but there you must shift for
yourself. The latter seems such a <HI>quiet</HI>
soul; the former, such a <HI>fool,</HI> that, take
my word for it, the patience of the one
will hold out till yours is quite tired of
the other.</P>
<P>In love forsooth! Pray, George, what
do <HI>you</HI> call love? I remember you were al∣ways
reckoned a good clever fellow at
school; but faith, in this instance, I very
much doubt your worship's sagacity.
What you talk of, seems to me the same
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
kind of <HI>penchant</HI> one boarding-school miss
feels for another. What, I'll warrant me,
the pretty creature won your heart by
helping you to finish a pair of net ruffles
Not that, I suppose, she netted a bit better
than yourself; but the manner was so ob∣liging!
then five years constancy to La∣dy
Harriet! Incorrigible wretch! Upon
my soul, I wonder I have patience to throw
away my time upon you: but I have been
this fortnight past at the Castle, where a
smart litttle widow at present boasts the
honour of my attentions, who, poor crea∣ture,
takes so much time in dressing, what
is much better undressed, that I had a mind
to encourage a charitable fit, and endea∣vour
to work the reformation of a young
fellow, who, but for my friendly arm held
out to save him, would fall into the lowest
abyss of prudence and stupidity. I'd give
the world to be witness of one half hours
<HI>tête á tête</HI> between you and Emilia, but
not that the world should bribe me to
be longer a spectator of your dullness:
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
for ever descanting on the weather, knot∣ting,
and perhaps, by way of variety,
now and then on a primrose, or violet,
to enliven the conversation.</P>
<P>But then, so much sensibility can ani∣mate
even knotting and primroses; and,
what is a much more melancholy truth,
even make a fool of Sir George Ashby.</P>
<P>If you love, George, convince me of
your passion, by snatching Emilia to your
arms; if you do not love, why this so∣lemn
farce? Marry Lady Harriet and be
stupid. At all events, till you have attain∣ed
some degree of sprightliness, boast not

<OPENER>Lady Harriet Somner to Miss Lennox</OPENER>
<P>MY Maria, pity your unhappy friend.
You, who have met with the smiles of
love, can but faintly picture the anguish
of a heart, bleeding at the indifference of
its beloved. Did he, my Maria, exult in
my sufferings, or carelessly forget his for∣mer
attachment, I could despise him—
but to despise Sir George Ashby, indeed,
my dear, it is impossible. His attention
is unremitted; he studies my very looks,
and flies to obey them but where is the
joy that once revelled in his smiles at my
approach; where that melting sensibility,
that lively approbation, that once animat∣ed
his intelligent eyes?—Ah, my
friend, if Sir George Ashby can change,
where shall we seek for constancy? if Sir
George Ashby can deceive, where shall
we seek sincerity?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
I was last night at Ranelagh. Sir George
introduced his friend, the once gay, once
blooming Lord Charles Rainsford; once
the life of every assembly: now melancho∣ly,
pale, dejected. Oh! Love! Thou source
of sorrow, what misery dost thou oc∣casion!
Say, my friend, is there a pang
which derives not its origin from that
spring? He, too, has lost the partner of
his heart.</P>
<Q>“Snatcht ere her prime, and in her bridal hour.”</Q>
<P>He walked with the Miss Montforts, two
Northamptonshire beauties, who made
their first appearance this winter. They
are sweet girls. The eldest, tall, spright∣ly,
blooming, beautiful as an angel, and
happy too; for she, my dear, glories in in∣sensibility.</P>
<P>Lucy, the youngest, elegantly formed;
a complexion fair as her spotless mind;
the most delicate features imaginable; a
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
countenance strongly expressive of the ut∣most
tenderness; and eyes in which you
read every sentiment of her heart.—Sweet
novice! too unpractised to disguise her
sufferings. She loves Maria; the lovely
girl owns her attachment.</P>
<P>Harry Willmott, two years ago, spent
the summer at Montfort-Hall. Two
young people, of exquisite sensibility, and
of unequalled merit, constantly together,
must, as my sweet Lucy says, indulge a
friendship for each other. Ah, Maria,
how dangerous are these tender friendships!
She esteemed him, she loved him as her
brother. Though always fond of the
country, she never thought it so delightful
as then, unconscious it was her Henry's
presence enlivened every scene.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott destroyed the pleasing
dream. He wrote to his son, that, by
great interest, he was nominated a writer
from Bengall. The opportunity was not
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
to be neglected; and the doating lover
must leave the mistress of his heart; leave
her ignorant of his sentiments.</P>
<P>The servant who brought the letter
waited with a chaise, and Harry Willmot
must embark at Portsmouth on the mor∣row.
What could he do? His Lucy's eyes
had oft betrayed the secret of her heart,
a secret of which she only was unconscious,
and ignorant of his sentiments, that he
should, doubtless, find her married on his
return.</P>
<P>The thought was not to be borne; it de∣termined
him. He flew to the garden,
and found his lovely Lucy busied in selecting
the fairest flowers to form a
nosegay for her tender friend. In artless
language he avowed the purest passion for
the amiable Lucy. To know she loved,
to find a lover, and to lose him, were the
same. She has not since heard of him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Surely, my dear, he must have had op∣portunities
for writing! O, these men are
strangely negligent; and though they will
not allow us their equals in understanding,
willingly yield us the palm in conduct.</P>

tempted to love, think of your friend,</P>

<P>NOT yet arrived, Harcourt? You can∣not

business can be so urgent to keep you from
your friend: say rather amusement is the
attracting load stone; that the charming

my sprightly insensible friend,

willow, to crown my despairing friend.</P>
<P>What you tell me of her sister may be
true; but the sex have no longer charms
for me. Were all their insinuating attrac∣tions
centred in one charming piece, this
heart would be still true to its first possessor,
would still retain its Delia's image.</P>

seems unhappy. Perhaps she weeps a bo∣som
friend; perhaps a softer cause; the
pangs of disappointed love</P>
<Q>“Prey on her damask cheek,”</Q>
<P>Amiable girl! my heart bleeds for thee.
Harcourt, assure her of my friendship, a
friendship always ready at the call of dis∣tress,
a heart always open to the unfortu∣nate.</P>
<P>Ah, for this fair Helen, I would lay
my life in less than a month, Harcourt is

your pardon, I had forgot my lively
friend scorns to marry thus <HI>en etiquette.</HI></P>
<P>What say you, Edmond, to a trip to
Scotland? The delight of persuading a
fine girl to run off with you, and all the
dear varieties of the journey, will just suit
thy enterprizing genius.</P>
<P>I confess myself greatly obliged to your

LONDON.</OPENER>
<P>Immediately upon my arrival, I flew to
your lodgings, and was informed you had
left town the night before.</P>
<P>How unlucky your absence! how severe∣ly
felt by a heart panting to unburthen it∣self
into the tender bosom of friendship!</P>
<P>Raging at my disappointment, I resol∣ved
to return to Bellmont; and had actu∣ally
ordered a chaise for that purpose, but
was prevented by Sir George Ashby, and
Augustus Richmond, who insisted on my
accompanying them to Ranelagh; they
rejected all my excuses as trifling; and
meer civility forced compliance.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"/>
In the name of wonder, Harcourt, how
came <HI>you</HI> absent, and Miss Montfort at
Ranelagh? Though surrounded by a
crowd of flatterers, there still seemed some∣thing
wanting to your Eliza's happiness,
and what that something was, not all her
affected indifference could disguise. <HI>Ce
n'est que du badinage;</HI> and yet, I dare swear,
thy unconscionable vanity will construe
this gross flattery into simple truth; and
we shall see the self-satisfied Edmond Har∣court,
with that air of agreeable effrontery
and assuming negligence, fancy himself a
perfect woman-killer; see him</P>
<Q>“Strut a straw-breadth nearer to the skies.”</Q>
<P>Soon after our entrance, Sir George Ash∣by
joined Lady Harriet, Richmond his old
associates, and your friend exhibited a me∣lancholy
proof how insipid every amuse∣ment
is in which the heart is uninterested.</P>
<P>Never did I see a greater assembly of fine
women. Lovely flutterers! Wonders of
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
a day! Say my friend, which of them
can boast a form more sweetly elegant, a
face more beautiful, a soul so spotless, as
my Delia's? And yet,</P>
<Q><L>“Like blossom'd trees, o'erturn'd by vernal storms,</L>
<L>Lovely in death, the beauteous ruin lies.”</L></Q>
<P>My friend, I often weary you with tales
of love—yet with these thoughts, con∣stantly
in my head, it is impossible but
that they must sometimes descend to my
pen, and surely, for such a cause, even
the most severe, will pardon the rising
sigh.</P>

<OPENER>Augustus Richmond, Es{que}, to Sir George Ashby.</OPENER>
<P>ABSOLUTELY, George, you are
intolerable, with your sensibility, senti∣ment,
and a thousand sounding nothings,
that never entered any other than thy rus∣ticated
head. Pray, Ashby, if you have
the least ambition <HI>pour sçavoir vivre,</HI> leave
these old fashioned notions to those who are
obliged, through necessity, to adopt them;
a set of old women, and antiquated cox∣combs;
and let us embrace the pleasures
within our reach; nor vainly refine on hap∣piness
till, like a vapour, it eludes our
grasp.</P>
<P>I am, at present, engaged in the pretti∣est
little adventure, and with the prettiest
little girl imaginable. Now had I but thy
soft stile, thy roses and lilies!—Faith,
George, I can no more equal <HI>thee</HI> in descrip∣tion,
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
than <HI>thou</HI> canst me in action. Our
talents are <HI>tout a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contraire;</HI> and when na∣ture
ordained a phaeton, why she was
obliged to form an Ovid to sing the burn∣ing
world, and your worship shall have
the honour of celebrating <HI>my</HI> exploits.</P>
<P>My present goddess possesses the most
enchanting <HI>naivité</HI> imaginable: and that
the dear soul has a taste for the witty, the
elegant, the agreeable, is incontestibly
proved by her approbation of Augustus
Richmond.</P>
<P>Give me a girl, George, that has some
life, some animation: not one of your
prim misses, educated between the nurse
and grandmother, and ushered into the
world a wonder of female virtue; a speci∣men
of their care, indeed, since they have
taken pains to eradicate every native feel∣ing
of the heart, and have at length suc∣ceeded,
and raised their charge above the
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares of men.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Faith, George, I could sooner pay my
adorations to my grandmother's image,
than to those prudish fair ones, those un∣natural
antidotes to love.</P>
<P>I cry you mercy, Ashby: upon my
life I had forgot; these ladies, “of affec∣tions
mild,” are the very goddesses of
your idolatry.—Now, harkee, my friend;
go to Salmon's, purchase a wax doll, the
size of Emilia, and run over your chime
of sentiments, sensations, honour, delica∣cy,
etcetera; and, as Emilia is too modest
to let a word escape her on such naughty
subjects, and you young platonists, doubt∣less,
possess great strength of imagination,
you will easily take your doll for your
Love; and, I would lay my life, George,
you might be married a month, before
you would find out the deception.</P>
<P>And so thou hast no ambition to be
counted a man of gallantry?—Well, it is
mighty pretty to quit the field, where we
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
are sure of being excelled; but I have pro∣mised
you my assistance. Dastardly cow∣ard,
not to brave all dangers, upon
the strength of that assurance! I tell thee
what, friend, Caesar's motto is mine; <HI>Ve∣ni,
Vidi, Vici:</HI> and really the poor souls are
so fond, you would be a most excellent
second.</P>
<P>I should like to meet with this “Unsus∣pecting
Innocence” you talk of. Such a
phrase might have sounded very well from
the lips of Adam, before his consort trans∣gressed;
but with that transgression, the
term grew useless.</P>
<P>Believe me, Ashby, I open thy letters
with as much solemnity as if they were fu∣neral
sermons. Is it impossible to burnish
thy rusticated ideas? I shall positively give
thee up, if it is not effected by the enliv∣ening

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir George Ashby to Captain Bevill.</OPENER>
<P>YES, my friend, I feel the force of
your arguments; but reason is too weak
to repel the insinuating intruder my heart
so readily admits.</P>
<P>Lady Harriet's person is beautiful, her
manner commanding, her mind accom∣plished;
but my Emilia, to all the sweet
simplicity, the artless graces of the rural
villager, joins the elegant polish of a court.
The sweetest innocence, the most attract∣ive
softness, the noblest sentiments, strong∣ly
characterise my lovely girl. In short,
Frederick, I will be just to the one, but
must doat upon the other. Lady Harriet,
unaccustomed to disguise, perceives not,
that my assiduities are the effect of com∣plaisance,
the forced attention of lifeless
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
ceremony.——Oh! Frederick! Can your
friend then make a deserving woman mise∣rable;
and, in return for beauty, love and
constancy, offer but the cold remnant of
an alienated heart?——You know I am
not vain, nor apt to fancy myself beloved;
but a thousand little incidents, visible only
to a lover's watchful eye, assure me my
Emilia is not indifferent; and Lady Har∣riet
owns her attachment.——Instruct me,
Frederick, to reconcile these seeming con∣tradictions;
to ratify my vows to Lady
Harriet, insure Miss Lesley's happiness,
and restore to this wounded bosom its long∣lost
peace.</P>
<P>Lady Ashby, though the most affecti∣onate
of mothers, and in other things
ever solicitous for her son's felicity, trem∣bles
at the thoughts of an unequal alliance.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll her pleasures center in pomp and splen∣dor;
and, in her idea, bliss is a never∣failing
attendant in the pageant of gran∣deur.—Emilia
sometimes ventures to argue
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
with my mother on this subject; and
though every word she utters penetrates
my soul, I dare not second sentiments I
admire. Shall we, my friend, ungene∣rously
ridicule a failing which has its origin
in maternal affection? I always loved
Lady Ashby; but since her kindness to
Miss Lesley, I idolize the good old wo∣man.
Charity, kindness, benevolence, are
virtues so very feminine, that the woman
who is destitute of them, wants the sweet∣est
embellishments of female virtue.</P>
<P>Would you believe it? Your gay friend,
Edmond Harcourt, is grown a woman's
slave; and the charming Miss Montfort,
the fair arbitress of his fate. How I love
to see these boasting insensibles humbled!
The poor Miss Cartwright too, who glori∣ed
in her indifference (an indifference by
the by never attempted), wanted but an
April day to thaw the icy coldness of her
heart.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/>
Tell me, Frederick, which are the most
detestable; your mighty susceptible fe∣males,
or your unnatural insensibles? The
first, having somewhere heard tenderness
is a female charm, shew the softness of
their heads by the susceptibility of their
hearts. The second, conscious of their
want of attractions, endeavour to enliven
desire, by apparent opposition. The lat∣ter,
indeed, seem most to have studied
our tempers, since we all love to surmount
difficulties. After all, Bevill, the happy,
the only happy are the insensible.</P>
<P>I expected you in town yesterday, and
waited to introduce you to Miss Lesley.
What, have you no curiosity, no desire to
see my Emilia? Take care, take care,
captain; for, believe me, if your heart is
not indeed invulnerable, she knows how
to wound it.</P>
<P>The chariot waits. I go to Lady Har∣riet—perhaps
to name the day.—O rea∣son,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
neglected Monitress, teach me in this
trying situation to preserve my honour,
nor yet to wound my peace.</P>
<P>One o'clock—just returned from Gros∣venor
Square.</P>
<P>Lady Harriet never looked so lovely,
lively, tender, animated.—Why, why, my
friend, have I not a heart to bestow?—I
pressed her to name the day; she turned
pale; and a shower of tears cut me to
the soul.</P>
<P>“Shall it be next week?——the week
after?——Speak, my Harriet, what
means this silence?”</P>
<P>Her heart, she said, had long been
mine—she was entirely at my disposal.</P>
<P>I was unusually attentive, yet I thought
every instance of my tenderness seemed to
encrease her melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45"/>
I mentioned Lucy Montfort. Lady
Harriet talked of the pangs of unrequited
love with more than common energy, wept
for Lord Charles Rainsford, and lamented
that the sickleness or death of one party
should be a source of such inexpressible an∣guish
to the other.</P>
<P>I again begged her to name the day
that was to make me the happiest of men.
She made no other answer than by a most
expressive look, that seemed to say “My
Ashby, I know what this attention costs
you.”——Oh! my friend, is it possible
she can have perceived the latent coldness
through this fond veil of love?</P>
<P>I came home out of spirits, peevish, un∣satisfied.
My mother wondered what so
much affected her darling son. Lady Har∣riet's
cruelty, a titled rival, a thousand
causes offered themselves to her imagina∣tion.
My Emilia's feelings, in that mo∣ment,
crowded to the lovely portals of
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
her soul—her eyes declared her concern.
In the sweetest accents she enquired after
my health, if my head was out of order.
—Ah! Frederick, why did she not dive
rather deeper and search my heart? How
would the lovely girl be astonished to
find it was she herself who caused the
anguish of her</P>

<OPENER>Colonel Harcourt to Lord Charles Rainsford.</OPENER>
<P>PRITHEE, Rainsford, did the blind
deity, when he enlisted you among the
number of his votaries, endow you with
this power of searching the hearts of
others? True, you discovered my love
before I was conscious my regard for Miss
Montfort merited that title; yet, believe
me, notwithstanding your amazing pene∣tration,
you have not yet fathomed this
heart. What! my Lord, is this insinu∣ating
passion to render me incapable of the
more solid joys of friendship? Is the charm∣ing
Eliza entirely to engross every faculty
of my soul? Whence proceeded this idea?
Not, surely, from yourself; for, with all
the passion that ever entered a tender heart,
you was still feelingly awake to the calls of
friendship.</P>
<P>My Eliza is the admiration, the idol of
all who know her. Beautiful as an angel,
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
she strikes all eyes: sensible, sprightly,
amiable, she charms all hearts. Cold and
unsusceptible,</P>
<Q><L>“She gazes all around her,</L>
<L>And wins a thousand hearts,</L>
<L>But Cupid cannot wound her,</L>
<L>For she has all his darts.”</L></Q>
<P>She triumphs in our sufferings, and redi∣cules
our pangs. Oh! Rainsford, Rains∣ford,
teach me to break these galling
chains. Think you see your friend (once
free as the warbling choristers) sighing
with a crowd of coxcombs,</P>
<Q>“By scorn alone, distinguished from the rest.”</Q>
<P>You, who are so intimately acquainted
with the tender passion, teach a lover to
recover his lost freedom. Teach thy
friend to break a woman's yoke, and be
again himself.</P>
<P>Miss Montfort yesterday enquired after
you.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49"/>
“Colonel Harcourt,” said she, “How is
your friend Lord Charles? Still immured
at Bellmont, and thinks, I dare swear,
when out of the reach of temptation, to
make a merit of his constancy.”</P>
<P>“Surely, Miss Montfort will own his
Lordship's retreat was highly necessary:
there is no sustaining, unwounded, the
artillery of her eyes.”</P>
<P>“Poor Colonel! I am afraid the cause
will be but indifferently defended, when
the opponent descends, by compliment,
to cheat his adversary of her understand∣ing.
But there can be no merit, Sir,
in unnecessary violence; nor can he
who shuns the combat, ever deserve a
triumph.”</P>
<P>“His friend, Miss Montfort, will be a
warning to him never to trust his happi∣ness
to a woman. O! my Eliza! either
bless me with your smiles, or teach me
to despise them. If my unremitted assi∣duities
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
can never soften this stoical in∣difference,
for mercy's sake appear not
thus all lovely.”</P>
<P>“Upon my word, Colonel, a most ex∣cellent
speech that:—and extempore
too!”</P>
<P>“Ungenerous girl, calmly to ridicule
the woes you cause! But know, madam,
this heart can break, but it will burst
your chain.”</P>
<P>“Right, Sir. This heroism is infinitely
becoming; and you will, doubtless, main∣tain
it.” (looking at her watch.) “I
forgot, I appointed to meet Lord Esdale
in the Mall, and it is now two o'clock.
If Colonel Harcourt ever thinks it worth
his while to call in Brook-street, we shall
be glad to see our friend.”</P>
<P>“Oh! my Eliza! You know your
power. The heart, once stamped with
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
your form, must ever bear the lovely
image.” (snatching her hand.) “I can∣not
leave you thus; swear you forgive
me.”</P>
<P>Lucy's entrance put an end to our con∣versation;
and I escorted the ladies to the
Mall.</P>
<P>Lucy was sweetly inquisitive about you.
She talked of you with a look of tender
concern. She pities you. “Ah, Colonel
Harcourt,” said she, “how dreadful to
be separated from what we love! But
why stay at Bellmont, where every ob∣ject
must remind him of his Delia?
Surely this gay metropolis might disi∣pate
his melancholy.”</P>
<P>“May I flatter myself my sweet friend
speaks from experience?”</P>
<P>“No, Colonel, I wish not to erase Mr.
Willmott's image from my heart: there
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
is a pleasure in unsuccessful love, when
we are certain the object deserves our
tenderness.”</P>
<P>Tell me, my Lord, cannot the amiable
Lucy succeed your Delia? I am but a bad
interpreter of looks, if yours have not
sometimes spoken that language.—Confess
the truth, Charles; do justice to your
friend's penetration; nor blush to own that
beauty, virtue, and sensibility, may win

<P>THERE was a time when Sir George

a time when he promised, that,
should his love ever suffer any diminuti∣on,
he would candidly confess the change.
Does he then imagine his Harriet's heart
too tender to bear the mortifying shock,
or her head too weak to furnish excuses
for involuntary inconstancy? Kindly soli∣citous
for her peace, he has endeavoured
to insure her happiness at the expence of
his own. And is he yet to learn they are
inseparable?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir George, the conflict was noble,
was worthy of you: but could I be base
enough to let you suffer for your genero∣sity,
I must despise myself. A heart,

Eminently distinguished by the charms of

<OPENER>Lord Charles Rainsford to Colonel Harcourt.</OPENER>
<P>YES, Harcourt, it is not in man to lis∣ten
to sentiments so refined, clothed in the
most elegant language, and proceeding
from ruby lips, and be insensible. Yet
my affection for Lucy Montfort is pure as
the angelic form, pure as the spotless mind
that roused my sensibility, and assured me
I had still a heart. I imagine it may be
possible to pass through life without a ten∣der
attachment; but, believe me, it is
not in man to love but once. The heart
once softened, readily admits future im∣pressions:
sensibility, once roused, can
never after lie dormant. Lucy too is en∣gaged:
her faithless Willmott still main∣tains
his empire in her heart.</P>
<P>I supped last night with Colonel Will∣mott,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
and enquired after his son. He in∣formed
me he was going to be married,
extremely well married: the lady young,
handsome, rich. What a blow for the
tender, the amiable Lucy! Yes, my sweet
girl; I will supply his place: we will in∣deed
be friends, constant, unalterable
friends.</P>
<P>Methinks I see you laugh, Harcourt,
and ask where this mighty <HI>friendly attach∣ment</HI>
is to end. Laugh as you will, my
friend, I am no platonist; yet do not be∣lieve
me incapable of friendship more re∣fined
than I can possibly describe.</P>
<P>I set out in a few hours for the duke of—'s
country seat: a visit, Edmond,
I hoped to have paid with my Delia.—Ah,
how unstable is human happiness! A
breeze bursts the thin texture of felicity;
and our joys evaporate in a moment. Had
any one last year assured me I should so
soon have lost the idol of my doating
heart, I had scorned the ill-omen'd boder.

<P>The Castle, 12 o'clock.</P>
<P>ON my life a most enlivening society
for a love-sick man! The gallant Lord
Egerton is here, who has been dying, in
rhyme, these twenty years, and is now
gayer than ever. Pity his looks contradict
his poetical assertions; though, if I may
believe him, the ladies, fearing to lose so
bright a subject of their charms, have,
through mere selfishness, preserved the va∣luable
life of this heroic Don Quixote.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
We have also here the eloquent Lord
Esdale, a second Demosthenes, who ha∣rangues
on beauty with the utmost proprie∣ty
and embellishes a head-dress with all
the flowers of rhetoric.</P>
<P>Then the inviting Lady Sarah—an old
maid, Harcourt—who gapes for a civil
speech as does a fish out of water for air,
and is ready to eat up every young fellow,
who comes within five yards of her.</P>
<P>We have here, likewise, the lovely
Arabella, who thinks and talks of nothing
but her charms. She vows she pities the
poor young men her cruelty drove to
despair.</P>
<P>“But love, you know, charming Ara∣bella,
on pity cannot live.”</P>
<P>“True, my lord, it is too thin a diet.
But pray, since Mr. Patchwell, the law∣yer,
told me last night murder is a
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
crime, what will become of me who
have killed so many?”</P>
<P>“O, Madam, love is the inseparable
attendant on beauty, and beauty like
yours was made to wound.”</P>
<P>“Dear, my Lord, and do you really
think, I am so handsome?—Well, I
always knew I was a beauty. Poor
Sir Harry, and my Lord, and the
Duke, and, and,—”</P>
<P>“O, my dear Arabella, it is impossible
to count your adorers. With undispu∣ted
beauty you strike all eyes; and,
sure to conquer, need but to be seen.”
—<HI>Quelle bagatelle</HI> to entertain my Har∣court!
Did the sex consider how infinitely
more attractive, the amiable endowments
of the mind render them in the eyes of
men of sense (mind, Harcourt, in <HI>our</HI>
eyes) they would cultivate the hidden dia∣mond.
But why turn our arms against
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
ourselves, by adding more charms to the
already too alluring sex? Happy for us,
kind nature formed them</P>
<Q><L>“In outward shew elaborate,”</L>
<L>“In inward less exact.”</L></Q>
<P>Lady Frances M—, the Duke's
daughter, is rather pretty, but proud and
impertinent, silly without simplicity, and
artful without understanding.—My
God! Harcourt, when shall I leave this fa∣tiguing
company?—Lord Egerton makes
me sick with his sonnets; Lord Esdale tires
me to death with eloquence; Lady Betty
with civility; Arabella with her charms;
and Lady Frances with her rank.—The
Duke's eldest son is for ever breaking in
on my retirement, to adorn the room with
flowers, or scent it with essences; while
the younger children distract me with
noise. In short, Harcourt, for the re∣mainder
of my life, I shall have an invin∣cible
aversion to poetry and poets, detest
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
eloquence, civility, beauty, assiduity, and
noise. I will not stay, the most urgent
business calls me to Bellmont; any thing
on earth for an excuse. Say, Edmond,
can your friend long inhabit a place where
to think on his Delia would be to profane
her lovely image?</P>
<P>The Duke and Dutchess seem destitute of
souls. Believe me, their greatest merit is
their having no character. Too idle to
think, too insensible to feel for themselves,
they drive with the torrent. Happily for
them, their associates, though ridiculous,
are innocent, and their Graces boast of
virtue: virtuous, Harcourt, by the mere
absence of vice. Good God! And couldst
thou intend thy creatures for this negative
perfection? Reject with me, my friend,
the humiliating, the unworthy idea; let us,
by our conduct, assert the superiority of
reason, and conquer our opponents, by
first showing we can conquer ourselves.</P>
<P>How is my amiable Lucy? Does she ever
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
mention her friends?—Ah, rather does
she ever talk of Willmott? Sweet girl, she
trembles not at the impending pang.
Conscious she merits happiness, she doubts
not of attaining it. Harcourt, I cannot
pity when suspicion is over-reached, or art
outwitted; but that this charming confi∣dence,
the natural result of innocence and
understanding, should be deceived, wounds
me to the soul.</P>

<OPENER>Augustus Richmond, Es{que} to Sir George Ashby.</OPENER>
<P>HA! Ha! Ha! My poor sober Sir
George! And has its Harriet really foil'd
it at its own weapons? I'll be hanged if the
letters you enclosed me are not admirable;
and you are the prettiest pair of turtles, that
ever coo'd in concert. <HI>Mais courage, mon
ami,</HI> love and fortune favour the daring:
strike a bold stroke, and the day is your
own. But prithee, George, no longer
persist in believing thyself in love. It is a
mighty pretty word, and derives inexpres∣sible
graces from the lips of a pretty fellow.
Then it opens such a fund of small talk; it
is impossible to support conversation with∣out
its animating assistance. In short, it is
a pretty <HI>bagatelle,</HI> invented for the amuse∣ment
of leisure hours; but to make a seri∣ous
thing of it, really, George, I blush for
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
you. We men of the world (in which so∣ciety
I thought you had been initiated)
content ourselves with the sound; and leave
to villagers, and women the reality. <HI>Eh
bien!</HI> and how is the <HI>amiable</HI> Emilia?
(your own epithet) and how the <HI>soft</HI> Sir
George? Faith, Ashby, I would have run
off with all the women in England in less
time than you take in swearing you are in
love.</P>
<P>I have thought of the most divine pro∣ject
for you. Contrive a breach between
Emilia and your mother; then let the <HI>dear
innocent</HI> throw herself into your friendly
arms for protection, <HI>et l'affaire est fini.</HI> But,
lest your worship, being no conjurer, or in
other terms, a very virtuous young man,
should be at a loss to accomplish this <HI>fracas,</HI>
behold my ready pen presents the means.
Has not your mother (I never knew an old
woman of quality that had not) some fa∣voured
friend, some humble confident, with
whom she sits and recounts the conquests
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
of her youth, recalls the happy hours of
courtship, and finds the flatterers of her
youth even exceeded by the dependants of
her old age, till by extorted commendati∣ons,
she puts it out of her power to suspect
the abilities of that head, or the integrity
of that heart, which has been to her the
tribunal from which there is no appeal?—
This woman, so long supporting the toils
of repeated narrations, and the tedious task
of flattery and applause, hopes, in the will
of her benefactress to find that reward her
life never could afford her. If there is such
a woman, George, about your mother,
gratify her avarice, and she is firmly your
friend. Then let her infuse suspicions into
Lady Ashby, that Emilia carries on an in∣trigue
with—Nay, start not—with your
worship, which your evident attachment
to each other will readily countenance.
But let the humble gentlewoman insinuate
that should her Ladyship enter into any ex∣planation
with Emilia, she will be under a
necessity of shewing great resentment to
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
her son, which must be accounted for to
Lady Harriet; and therefore still longer
protract an alliance she has been so long the
occasion of delaying. In the mean time,
the girl, finding an evident alteration in
Lady Ashby's conduct, flies with her tale
of sorrow to her friend Sir George, in∣treats
your intercession with the old damsel,
who, convinced by that of her guilt, or∣ders
her instantly to leave the house. Over∣whelmed
with grief for her misfortune,
with regret that she knows not the occasion
of it, she accepts your offer of conveying
her to some country village, till her confi∣dent
(for I know all young Misses have vi∣olent
notions of friendship) can be inform∣ed
of her distress. It will be your fault,
you know, if the letter ever reaches the
hand for which it was intended; you, there∣fore,
have the less cause to fear detection;
and Emilia, in the supposed infidelity of
her female friend, will have double reason
to adore your goodness.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69"/>
Dear creatures! I can no longer have
the cruelty to keep you waiting. (The
widow I mean, and a devilish fine girl that
have been prancing under my window this
half hour.)—Behold, George, how great
my friendship!—Now for the women.</P>

<P>MY dear friend, you know not your
danger. This Sir George Ashby, why so
often mentioned; why dwell with such
delight on his name? Oh, Emilia, I
tremble for you. Your unexperienced
heart, captivated by that fair semblance of
virtue, sees not the betrayer in the polite,
the attentive Sir George. Charmed by
the gay tints, the blooming foliage of the
rose, it thinks not on the thorn. How
should my amiable, my artless Emilia,
herself incapable of disguise, suspect it in
another? It is true, Sir George is engaged:
but believe me, my sweet girl, beauties,
like yours, might tempt him to (might
perhaps justify) inconstancy. Lady Ash∣by,
though universally allowed a good and
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
benevolent woman, is rigid, even to se∣verity,
in her ideas of filial obedience;
and highly valuing the gifts of fortune,
can you think it probable she will sacrifice
Lady Harriet Somner to—Emilia Lesley?
—O, my love, call your reason to your
aid, suffer not your heart to be engaged,
and remember a sentiment I have frequent∣ly
heard you admire. “A maid passes
the first bounds of reservedness who al∣lows
herself to <HI>think</HI> she is in love.”—
Pardon the apprehensions of a friend,
zealous for her Emilia's welfare: Lady
Harriet has a claim to your Ashby's undi∣vided
heart.—Were there no other impe∣diment,
yet your dependant situation, his
rank in life, Lady Ashby's ambition.—In∣deed,
Emilia, it cannot be. Consult your
own happiness, and shun this seducing en∣ticer,
this Sir George.</P>
<P>What say you, my dear girl? the coun∣try
is at this season peculiarly charming.
My Emilia, quit the glittering scene, and
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
in the sweets of rural retirement regain
thy almost lost serenity.—Lady Ashby will
give permission for a few weeks absence,
and it shall be my ambition to make your
stay agreeable; not that I can promise you
half the fine things you hourly hear. I
blush to say, that where I am, there should
be a dearth of beaus; but your Henrietta
will be fonder than a train of flatterers,
and her friendship more unalterable than
the oaths of lovers.</P>

<P>“START not!”—Ah, Augustus, is
it possible I should do otherwise than start,
at the complicated scene of villainy your
last presented to my imagination? Dia∣bolical
invention! And yet, Augustus, see
the depravity of human reason: I adopt a
villainy my heart detests. Already have I
set the implement of cruelty at work.—
Surely the Devil presented Mrs. Burton's
image to you, you drew her so exactly.
The woman would persuade me, too, she
thinks it for my good Emilia should be re∣moved,
that my marriage may be no
longer delayed.—The gentle Emilia has
this instant sent to intreat my company in
her dressing-room. Never before did I
obey her dear commands so reluctantly,</P>
<Q><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Sir <HI>George Ashby</HI> in Continuation.</Q>
<P>EMILIA met me with a flood of
tears.</P>
<P>“Ah, Sir George,” said she, “how
can I relate my sorrows to you, or how
hope the son, should condescend to hear
the distresses of a wretched dependant
on his mother's bounty, when that mo∣ther
disdains to listen to a recital of her
anguish, or her intercessions for forgive∣ness,
though unconsoious of a crime?”</P>
<P>She sunk into a chair, unable to pro∣ceed,
till my endeavours to sooth her had,
in some measure, succeeded.</P>
<P>“I took the liberty, Sir George,” con∣tinued
she, “to request the favour of
an interview, in hopes from the good∣ness
you have ever shewn me (though
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
when Lady Ashby proves unkind, where
can I hope for friendship?) that you
would intercede for my forgiveness, or
at least learn the cause of my misfor∣tune.”</P>
<P>I gave her instant assurances of my con∣cern
for her interest, left her, and went to
my mother's apartment.</P>
<P>Oh, Richmond, how shall I describe to
you the success our deep-laid villainy met
with here? The rage of Lady Ashby was
as great as you could wish. She bade me
instantly tell Emilia to quit her house. My
affected entreaties exasperated her more,
and she sent the most cruel message by Mrs.
Burton. On my return to the dejected
Emilia, I endeavoured, (but in vain) to
calm her troubled soul: She repeatedly
called upon her friend, her Henrietta
Winchester; wished her kind protectress
at hand; talked of flying to her; but,
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
cast off by Lady Ashby, who would re∣ceive
her?</P>
<P>Every minute I was on the point of
owning my guilt, of throwing myself at
Lady Ashby's feet, and entreating her to
restore Emilia to her favour.—Are these,
thought I, the joys of that love Richmond
talks of, which can know no happiness,
but in the wretchedness of its object? But
the thought that it was now too late to ob∣tain
belief from Lady Ashby deterred me.
I told Emilia I would in a post chaise con∣vey
her to a farm about twenty miles dis∣tant,
and that, in the mean time, nothing
on my part, and that of Mrs. Burton,
should be omitted to effect Lady Ashby's
reconciliation.—Poor, deluded girl! Ah,
Richmond! where is the so-much boasted
merit of deceiving; and to whom belongs
the triumph, since the deceiver feels a
thousand pangs for every one his wiles in∣flict?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
The chaise I had ordered drove up to the
door. I put the trembling Emilia into it,
and conveyed her to a little retreat, whose
peaceful shades never before received so fair
a visiter, or—such an accomplished vil∣lain.</P>
<P>I have taken lodgings at a farm in the
neighbourhood—but take notice, Rich∣mond,
never will I receive Emilia to my
arms but with her own consent. Talk no
more, therefore, of your potions, your
poisonous draughts: you have already ad∣ministered

<P>I Might perhaps listen to my poor Har∣court;
but, as things are situated, upon
my word, Sir, it is impossible. These
men are our never-ceasing torments. Love
them and they leave you, scorn them, and
they tease you to death. Believe me, Co∣lonel,
I love myself too well to make a
present of my liberty. “The maid who
loves must put her trust in miracles for
safety:” and I not being blest with the
faith that removes mountains, seek not for
happiness in sensibility, lest vainly aiming
at pleasure, I make shipwreck of my peace.
—These men, Fanny, are never repuls∣ed,
it is impossible to affront them. Our
smiles assure them they possess our hearts;
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
our very frowns have a peculiar meaning;
and if, disgusted at their shocking appear∣ance,
we venture to shut our eyes, they
swear it is but to deliver ourselves from
temptation.</P>
<P>Strange that Lucy has not yet heard from
Harry Willmott! Ah, Fanny, how mise∣rable
the maid, who trusts in man for hap∣piness!
Conscious of their power to pain us,
they refine on torture, and with amaz∣ing
indifference, consign us to the tor∣ments
of suspence, and all the pangs of
ill-requited love.</P>
<P>Lord Charles Rainsford has been some
days in town, he seems diligently assiduous
in studying my Lucy's wishes, and trans∣cendently
delighted when he can procure
her pleasure. Would this amiable man
might supply her Willmott's place!</P>
<P>By the way, Fanny, don't you think
his Delia's image readily erased? Ah, be∣lieve
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
them not. When they swear eternal
love it is but a bait to tempt us to their
hook, and this their boasted constancy but
an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> to lure us to our ruin.</P>
<P>A knock at the door.</P>
<P>“If it is Colonel Harcourt, let him be
admitted.”</P>
<P>He comes at a good time, Fanny, and
your friend is in a most charming disposition
for a love scene.</P>
<P>“Good morrow, Colonel.”</P>
<P>“Writing Miss Montfort! I fear I inter∣rupt
you. Happy they to whom these

Or nature, charmed with the lovely cas∣ket,
forgot it wanted but a heart to ren∣der
you her most perfect production.”</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
“On my word, Colonel, these clear
days are prodigiously advantageous to the
understanding. A good conceit that,
and original too, I dare swear. Will a
walk be agreeable to you, Sir? We were
just going out.—Betty, let my sister
know the Colonel waits to attend her.—No
excuses, positively you must go.”</P>
<P>“Oh, Miss Montfort, allow me a few
minutes. Can you resolve to trifle with
a heart that adores you; to triumph in a
lover's sufferings?”</P>
<P>“Still on the old subject, Harcourt? I
must not hear you. I am wise enough to
take warning from a friend's experience,
and will shun the fantastic tyrant. Can
<HI>you,</HI> who boast yourself my friend, wish
me to resign an indifference which con∣stitutes
my happiness?”</P>
<P>“Suffer me, my Eliza, to convince you
that the happiness you fancy you possess,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
can only be found in the enlivening trans∣ports
of mutual passion.”</P>
<P>“I fear, Harcourt, it were but a dange∣rous
experiment, and I must either way
be worsted.”</P>
<P>“Why, is it my Eliza's pride to resist
the tender dictates of her heart?”</P>
<P>“Colonel Harcourt, when I meet with
a man honest, sensible, incapable of
falsehood, my heart shall own its con∣queror;
till then suffer me to enjoy the
indifference you cannot condemn.”</P>
<P>Why, Fanny, must I be teazed about
a passion I resolve never to experience?
These men, my dear, are the veriest
tyrants in the world. More cruel than even
their own Caligula, they wish our whole sex
had but one heart, that they might wound
us at a blow. Colonel Harcourt, talk to
me again of love, and I will hate you. It

<OPENER>Lady Harriet Somner to Miss Lennox.</OPENER>
<P>YOU are mistaken, Maria, my Ashby
is still the man of honour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> still perfectly in∣nocent,
nor can I even blame his incon∣stancy.—To
have been beloved by Sir
George Ashby is a glory I would not barter
to reign the unrivalled idol of kneeling mo∣narchs,
and the pleasure I experience from
that sweet conviction, is infinitely superior
to the adulation of the unmeaning crowd.</P>
<P>You are dissatisfied with my last letter.
“When I expected,” (say you) “that La∣dy
Harriet would have imparted her sor∣rows
to her friend, how unkind this as∣sumed
heroism!” After a friendship be∣gun
in infancy, and cemented by the en∣dearing
tye of mutual confidence, can my
Maria need to be informed that her Harriet
sensibly feels afflictions, but knows not to
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
complain?—That I still love Sir
George Ashby, is true. Ah, my dear,
is it possible to see him, and be insen∣sible
of his charms; to feel his merit,
and cease to love him? But how vain the
boast of that affection, which does not in∣struct
us to prefer the beloved object to
our selves! Could happiness be pur∣chased
with one sigh from my Ashby, I
would reject the tempting bait.</P>
<P>My brother, yesterday, introduced Lord
Frederick Beaumont, a young nobleman
just returned from his travels, This agree∣able
creature has just wit enough to enter∣tain,
and good humour enough to please.
He dresses, compliments, and trifles to ad∣miration,
possesses an infinite fund of small
talk, and is the universal favourite of the
ladies.—But when may we expect my
brother's friend, this Marquis? “Ah,
Harriet, Harriet, does not this impati∣ence
betray the female?”</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Can I, my dear, be unanxious for the
arrival of a brother's earliest friend? His
esteem declares him worthy, and his per∣sonal
graces, if not exaggerated by the
partial praises of friendship, would charm
the coldest heart. Maria, what if for once,
in my life, I turn match-maker, and give
thee to the Marquis? believe me, I feel
myself infinitely more consequential from
my newly acquired office.</P>
<P>The amiable Lucy Montfort is unhap∣py.
So young to taste misfortune! Ah,
Maria, what is this boasted sensibility?
Who could believe that the bitterest sor∣rows
flow from the sweetest spring, and
that those tender sentiments which, from a
casual survey, one would imagine granted
but to receive and confer felicity, should
but render us the more susceptible of mise∣ry?—These
Lords of the creation, my
friend, can make their love subvervient to
their pride, and their passions move at the
command of interest.—More variable than
the volatile butterfly.</P>
<Q><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
<L>“The lawless libertine may rove,</L>
<L>Free and uncensured thro' the wilds of love.”</L></Q>
<P>My Maria, Sir George Ashby, is chang∣ed!
How true is it that men are “constant
only in inconstancy!”</P>
<P>Eliza Montfort is universally admired,
and Colonel Harcourt is much with her.
I am mistaken if these two flints discover
not, by mutual collision, their latent fire.</P>
<P>This agreeable man, was, a few years
ago, unfortunate in an affair of the heart.
His parents died, while he was too young
to feel his loss, and left their little Edmond
to an uncle's care. An unincumbered es∣tate,
near five hundred a year, defrayed
the expences of his education; and, when
he returned from making the tour of Eu∣rope,
he found their family encreased by
the company of a beautiful girl, the
daughter of an intimate friend. Edmond
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
felt the force of her attractions, nor was
his Caroline uninterested in his passion?
They vowed to live but for each other,
and our friend's behaviour was too particular
to escape observation. His uncle discover∣ed
his attachment, and ordered him, as he
valued his favour, to think no longer of
her; assured him, he loved him as his son,
and that if he married with his approbati∣on,
he intended to make him his heir.
No interested motives could move the ge∣nerous
Harcourt; but our lovers were
obliged to be more circumspect. Soon af∣ter
this, his aunt died; and Edmond, by
his uncle's desire, went immediately after
the funeral to settle some affairs in London.
He went with more alacrity, convinced
that Caroline intended quitting her friend's
house, as her stay was now become highly
improper. His business detained him lon∣ger
than he expected, and three months
were nearly elapsed when he received a let∣ter
from his uncle, requiring his immedi∣ate
attendance at H—. Post horses
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
were ordered, and our astonished friend
obeyed the hurrying summons.—His
wonder was greatly encreased, when he
came within his uncle's estate. He was
not met as usual, by the chearful tenants;
and, when he passed a rural cottage, the
children pointed at the chaise, while the
old people, with anxious care, avoided
his looks.—He stopped the postillion,
and enquired the reason of this concern;
but could obtain no answer.—When
he approached the house, an air of festivi∣ty
and joy augmented his surprize. He
discovered his adored Caroline, who came
out to meet him. Transported at the un∣expected
pleasure, he threw himself out
the chaise, and would willingly have
caught her to his bosom,—Think,
Maria, what this tender lover must have
felt, when his uncle introduced an
aunt, in the person of his beloved mis∣tress!
—Surprize, indignation, and con∣tempt,
entirely deprived him of the use
of speech, and he suffered himself to be
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
conducted to the house. This stupid calm
soon dissipated, and, with returning reason,
he beheld Caroline sunk even below re∣proach.
He wished them joy with real
composure; and, to convince this faith∣less
woman his heart must ever act in con∣cert
with his judgment, he determined to
stay that night, and discovered his con∣tempt
by more than common vivacity.
He left H—the next morning: and
has, since that, foresworn the sex.</P>
<P>Surely, Maria, this man has cause; his
fair prospects of fortune blasted thus, and
by the woman he loved. What a topic
for those who glory to detract from female
merit, and ridicule the sex!</P>

<P>YES, my Henrietta, the measure of
my woes is full: and but for the consola∣tion
of your tender, your faithful friend∣ship,
the grave must, ere this reaches your
hand, have received a being which, worn
by afflictions, and sunk into the lowest a∣byss
of misfortune, looks to you only for
support.</P>
<P>Would I could recount my sorrows to
you! But, Henrietta, it is, perhaps, the
greatest of my misfortunes that I am igno∣rant
of their source.—Ignorant of their
source did I say? No, my friend, it is an
Almighty being who inflicts these punish∣ments
for our good, who sees our errors,
and by whose wise ordinations “Man is
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
born to trouble, as the sparks fly up∣wards.”</P>
<P>Unconscious of any crime I had commit∣ted,
I perceived the greatest alteration in
Lady Ashby's conduct towards me with
astonishment; and, when I received her
orders instantaneously to depart, who can
express my anguish? I had flown to you
immediately; but, discarded with igno∣miny
by Lady Ashby, could I hope your
family would receive me? I accepted Sir
George's generous protection, till I could
think of some means for my support. He
has placed me in a sweet retreat. Will
you excuse the intrusion on your patience,
if I try to enliven my letter with some lit∣tle
description of it?</P>
<P>Figure to yourself a small white house,
thatched; the walls almost overgrown with
jasmine, sweet briar, and honeysuckles.
A hill rises gently behind it, and, on one
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
side, the prettiest little wood imaginable.
Through a meadow, before the house, in∣terspersed
with clumps of trees, a small
river winds its way, and loses itself on
one hand in the wood I mentioned, on
the other runs behind the hill, on the top
of which, amidst some venerable trees,
you discover the ruins of a castle over∣grown
with ivy. I see a little path wind∣ing
up towards it; and the good people
here, (a farmer, his wife, their son, and
one maid) tell me I shall be charmed with
the prospect from a seat there. Ah, Hen∣rietta,
and is there any thing can charm
me now?—Yes, there is one thing af∣fords
me a satisfaction which even
malice cannot deprive me of: “A consci∣ence
void of offence.” And if I am
favoured with another letter from you,
as kind as yours usually are, I shall add
my Henrietta's friendship, scarcely less
dear to me than the other blessing.
—With such comforts as these, shall
I despond?—Shall my tears flow too,
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
when I think on Sir George Ashby's kind∣ness?—No,
the protection of the most
amiable, the most deserving man in the
world, would chear a heart borne down by
afflictions, even superior to mine.—It
would make</P>
<Q>“Hope blossom, in the shades of death.”</Q>
<P>Acquitted to herself, approved by Miss
Winchester and Sir George Ashby, Emi∣lia
no longer shall give way to sorrow.
Again shall her books, her mandolin, and
her embroidery, afford the enjoyment
which they used:</P>
<Q>“And I and malice from this hour are friends.”</Q>
<P>Sir George comes to visit me; he comes
in that elegant phaeton from which he said
he would shew me the most delightful
country in the world. It is a lovely even∣ing;

<OPENER>Miss Montfort to Miss Sedley.</OPENER>
<P>“WHEN does my Eliza think of
returning to Montfort Hall?” Bless me,
child, what a question! Who, dost thou
think would submit to be immured in that
Gothic mansion, the wonder but of stupid
clowns, that can reign the toast of this
gay metropolis?</P>
<P>Indeed, Harcourt, thou hast no chance.
Even a cockade, supported but by a poor
five hundred, will be ineffectual to subdue
the haughty Eliza. And yet, my dear,
this man is infinitely charming; nature
seems to have amply atoned the cruelty of
fortune.</P>
<P>O, I forgot. Would you believe it? I
think of entering the pale of matrimo∣ny;
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
and the man—such a man, child!—
How kind this early notice! You see I de∣scend
from my altitude of power to warn
you country misses. Prepare your batte∣ries;
for, if your hearts are not impregna∣ble,
this Adonis will be the easy victor.
Let me attempt to describe him. Now
for smiling loves, and Cupid's whole ar∣tillery.—Alas!
my friend, it will not
do; and I must unwillingly quit the sub∣lime.
This redoubtable hero then is, in
plain English, tall, thin, silly, and imper∣tinent;
perpetually aiming at wit, and
withall heavier than his own lead mines.</P>
<P>I have ever considered sense as the native
of every soil, a plant that wants but the
warm sunshine of favour to unfold its open∣ing
blossoms; but this booby, son of a
fond father, has staggered my opinion.
He possesses an immoderate fortune, and
has engaged Lady Beverly as his advocate.
Is it possible to hold out against their joint
eloquence? Her Ladyship declares that,
as it is customary to marry, she thinks I
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
cannot have a better offer, and has pro∣mised
to provide the wedding dinner, and
regulate the <HI>etiquette</HI> of the day. How
fortunate this man, Fanny, to have made
a second of the only woman in the world
who would not have outshone him!—These
monied-men, I imagine, lose a
grain of sense for every additional guinea;
and so, thanks to kind nature, we are near∣ly
on a par, our intellects being perfectly
equivalent to their wealth.—This is a fruit∣ful
theme, and numberless reflections crowd
to my pen, but they are so obvious your
own mind will easily suggest them. One
would conclude from this irremediable
stupidity, that the dross, unwilling to be
parted from its native ore, inhabits the
soul of its possessor, and “those whom
God has joined together, let no man
put asunder.”</P>
<P>Bless me! Matrimony too, and Colonel
Harcourt at the door! Ominous, upon my
word. Well, if I <HI>must</HI> marry, give me
the amiable Edmond, and a knapsack.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
<HEAD>In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>POSITIVELY, Harcourt, I retract.—Lord,
my dear, such an affair!</P>
<P>I put my letter in my pocket, and hur∣ried
down to the Colonel. He was lively,
agreeable, engaging—I had almost said ir∣resistible.
At last the creature grew pre∣suming,
and insisted on my listening to his
tale of love. I ran up to fetch my draw∣ings
to divert his attention, and was some
minutes before I returned. He commend∣ed
them, and took up a pencil to make
some trifling alterations; then looking sted∣fastly
upon me, “Miss Montfort,” said
he, “have you not lost a paper?”</P>
<P>Think, Fanny, how I was confused,
when he drew my letter from his pocket!</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100"/>
“Have you opened it, Colonel Har∣court?—Answer
me sincerely.”</P>
<P>“Upon my honour, Madam, I am ig∣norant
of the contents.”</P>
<P>“Thank Heaven!” said I, raising my
hands with transport. My emotion, I sup∣pose,
awakened his curiosity. He caught
the paper, and swore he would read it. I
used my utmost endeavours to prevent
him, but in vain.</P>
<P>“My Eliza, give me your word I am
not mentioned, and I will restore it.”</P>
<P>“Vain wretch!” said I.</P>
<P>What could I do, Fanny? I scorned an
absolute falshood; and to let him read it
in my presence was shocking. In this di∣lemma
I did the very thing I should have
avoided; I ran up stairs, and locked my∣self
into my chamber. A mighty un∣necessary
precaution though, I found; for
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
the Colonel was not disposed to invade my
retirement, and had left the house a few
minutes after I went up stairs. This I
learnt from Isabella, Lady Beverly's at∣tendant,
to whom he gave the letter, seal∣ed
up in a blank sheet of paper, with or∣ders
to deliver it to me as soon as he was
gone.</P>
<P>Fanny, what shall I do with this
man? Surely he will be here this even∣ing—however,
I shall not send this till
I have seen him.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.—No Colonel Harcourt.
Ah, my dear, when these men know our
partiality, how ready their neglect! But
on such a theme it is no merit to excel;
when your Eliza wishes to display her wit
and ingenuity, she will endeavour to praise
the wretches.</P>
<P>Lady Beverly talks of going soon to
France to fetch her daughter, who is at the
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
convent of Marquette. She gives us rea∣son
to imagine that nothing but our being
in town could induce her to delay her jour∣ney.
I entreat her not to let us prevent her
expedition; but, my dear, it is so very
uncustomary for the mistress of a house to
leave her visiters, that her Ladyship can∣not
think of it.—Now could we but per∣suade
her that the Dutchess, the Countess,
or Lady such-a-one had set the example,
believe me, we should hear no more scru∣ples.
—This woman would blush at no
crime if it could be enrolled in the rules of
politeness; and had rather see the world in
flames, than infringe one point of cere∣mony.
—But if she goes, the amiable Isa∣bella
must accompany her. Fanny, I feel
myself greatly interested in the fate of this
poor girl. Her person is agreeable; and
her face, before it was worn with the tra∣ces
of sorrow, was doubtless charming.
There is a peculiar dignity, a certain ele∣gance
about her, which declare her the
sport of fortune.—I hinted my suspici∣cions.
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
She blushed, and, at my earnest
desire, promised me the recital of her mis∣fortunes.
As soon as she performs her en∣gagement,
I shall impart them to my
Fanny, certain that her tender heart feels
for afflictions which she never experienced,
and that she will join in pitying the
mourner, with her</P>

<P>WELL, George, how go you on?
By this time, as happy as an emperor, I'll
warrant me; and Emilia as kind as—she
she is lovely, I suppose you will say.—
I am glad of it, with all my soul; and
when you have a thought to spare from
her, think on the author of your pleasures.
Yes, you sneaking devil, you might have
sighed to eternity, had not my divine inge∣nuity
furnished you with expedients. But
I will not remind you of what your grati∣tude
must save me the trouble of; there∣fore
I'll treat you with some of my own
affairs.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half from this ha∣bitation
(for the dear creatures here are so
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
solicitous for my stay, that I can't find in
my heart to leave then<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) there stands a snug
little cottage, by the side of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver, where
Dick Richardson and I were strolling the
other evening, when we were stopped by
the sound of the most harmonious wild
notes you can imagine. The song we
soon distinguished for “What med'cine
can soften the bosom's keen smart?” A
thick hedge divided us from the songstress.
I swore I would have one kiss from the lips
which breathed such harmonious sounds,
and for that purpose began to scale the
hedge. Dick, who would not have ran
the risk of scratching his face, or tearing
his ruffles for the world, declared, “I was
monstrous unpolite to leave the ladies
so long;” and, finding me resolute, left
me, swearing he wished she might turn
out the ugliest devil in the country. But I
had good reason for supposing otherwise,
my servant having before told me of the
most beautiful girl he had ever seen; and
I had bent my steps that way purposely
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
to have a view of her. I was soon on the
other side the hedge, in a small garden,
where the sweetest syren my eyes had ever
beheld, was spinning in a little arbour
surrounded by roses and lilies, faint em∣blems
of her beauties.</P>
<P>Alarmed at my appearance, she quitted
her employment, and was running to∣wards
the house, when I caught her in my
arms.</P>
<P>“Dear creature,” said I, “take <HI>me</HI> for
your Damon, and you shall find me
more constant than him you sing of.”</P>
<P>“Alas! Sir,” said she, “if sincerity
has fled from the village, how can we
hope the seats of opulence should af∣ford
it?”</P>
<P>I shall not repeat all that was said; suf∣fice
it that, finding her so astonishingly
sensible, nay elegant in her conversation, I
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
was solicitous to learn whence she gained
it, and found the curate of the parish had
instructed her with his own daughter. But
had I opened a book which lay near her, I
had been no longer at a loss to account for
her purity of thought, or delicacy of ex∣pression.
The most refined ideas, cloathed
in the utmost elegance of language, de∣clared
the writings of the inimitable John∣son,
her favourite study.—Imagine,
George, how bewitching the sublime sen∣timents
of that divine author, familiarized
by the softness of feminine sensibility.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Richardson, who
was afraid I should ridicule his want of
Quixotism, had brought the ladies from
the Castle to the farm, where they found
me in earnest conversation with Marian.
They have been trying ever since (as
much as they <HI>dare,</HI> though, take notice)
to be witty upon the occasion, while I
own to you I am little disposed to return
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
their raillery. The girl has made more
impression than I could wish upon my
heart, and I am convinced her virtue is
impregnable. What's to be done?—Oh,

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF
ISABELLA.</HEAD>
<P>“I OBEY Miss Montfort's orders; may
she learn from the unfortunate Isabella,
that there is no other road to happiness,
but through the Temple of Virtue.”</P>
<P>“My father, in the early part of life,
quitted a world incapable of amusing an
enlightened mind, or of satisfying a feel∣ing
heart. To an understanding naturally
refined, and improved by reading, the
world had nothing to offer but a constant
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
succession of the same tiresome ceremonies,
the same unentertaining pleasures. He saw
those talents that were bestowed for the no∣blest
ends, employed for the basest purpos∣es,
and beheld, with regret, that beauty,
which was once the sweetest reward of
heroes, poets, and philosophers.”</P>
<Q><L>“Now gaily blunts on fops its fatal dart,</L>
<L>Nor claims the triumph of a letter'd heart.”</L></Q>
<P>“Disgusted at high life, he quitted the
brilliant scene without regret; and sought
variety in solitude. Happily for him,
Mrs. Raymond and her agreeable daugh∣ter,
who lived about a mile distant, pre∣vented
his perceiving that the discontent∣ed
carry within themselves the source of
their uneasiness.—Why, Miss Montfort,
do the understanding and the heart lie so
distant, and the dictates of the one so sel∣dom
regulate the feelings of the other?
—My father's heart confessed Miss Ray∣mond's
charms,” but “the world's dread
laugh,” determined him to set in compe∣tition
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
with his happiness, that censure he
so lately despised.</P>
<P>“Mrs. Raymond was the widow of an
officer, who had often signalized his cou∣rage
in the field? and, thinking with Cae∣sar,”
that “It were better to suffer death
once, than always to live in fear of it”,
with the most heroic valour lost his life,
in bravely defending his country. Him∣self,
his lovely partner, and their prattling
offspring, had long subsisted on his pay.
This tender husband feared his death
would overwhelm the heart which poverty
could never wound. The thought of his
Isabella's pangs was the only tie that kept
him from the skies, and her lovely image
quitted his faithful heart, but with the ex∣piring
sigh.</P>
<P>“As soon as Mrs. Raymond recovered
her loss, accompanied by her daughter,
and with no other provision than her pen∣sion,
she retired to L—; and, soli∣citous
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
for her Charlotte's happiness,” em∣ployed
the utmost care “to raise her tender
thought.”</P>
<P>“Miss Raymond was about eighteen
when my father settled at L—, agree∣able
in her person, lively, and engaging.
He approached her with indifference, but
found it impossible to quit her without re∣gret.
Though far from a regular beauty,
she had that inexpressible <HI>Je ne sçai quoi</HI>
that is infinitely attractive.”</P>
<P>He tried every method to drive her idea
from his mind; but, finding it as impossi∣ble
as it was to refrain from visiting her, he
resolved to make the tour of Europe. He
was two years in travelling, but not meet∣ing
that satisfaction he promised himself,
and convinced, by experience, that ab∣sence
but endears the object of our affecti∣ons,
immediately after his arrival in Lon∣don,
he set out for L—, and wonder∣ing
he had so long rejected a happiness that
<PB N="123" REF="115"/>
courted his acceptance, received Isabella
from the hands of a delighted Mother.</P>
<P>“My birth was but a prelude to my fu∣ture
miseries, and deprived my father of
the best of wives. Perhaps that was the
reason why I possessed so little of his affec∣tion.”</P>
<P>“I was put out to nurse, for my pre∣sence
redoubled his concern, as he looked
upon me as the source of all his misfor∣tunes.”</P>
<P>“Mrs Raymond, soon after, desired
permission to take care of her little grand∣daughter,
a request readily complied with.”</P>
<P>“While under her friendly care, health,
peace, and innocence led on each smiling
hour; but, ere I was twelve years old, I
lost the guide of my unexperienced years,
this tender instructress.”</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116"/>
“My father took me to his house. The
most trifling instances of his affection ef∣faced
the remembrance of this more than
mother; and, in his growing fondness, I
forgot my sorrow.—But it is needless,
Madam, to trouble you with those juve∣nile
incidents which afforded nothing either
new or entertaining: it will be sufficient to
inform you that, at seventeen, I found my∣self
surrounded with every elegance that
can enliven pleasure; and the undoubted
heiress of immense wealth. The men con∣fessed
they thought me amiable, while a
crowd of coxcombs paid homage to my
charms, and declared my cruelty drove
them to despair. These men, Miss Mont∣fort,
swear they die by our frowns, but
where is the willow that can bear testimo∣ny
to the truth of their assertions?”</P>
<P>“My father was seldom at home: his
companions engrossed his whole time.
Left entirely to myself, and of a lively dis∣position,
my gaieties were unbounded.
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
Amusement, pleasure, dress, and dissipa∣tion,
left no time for more serious avoca∣tions.
The men endeavoured to inspire
me with love, but found I laughed at their
pretensions, and ridiculed their vows.—
Happy, Madam, had I maintained my
opinion, and still preserved that insensibili∣ty!
The woman who parts with it must
be miserable.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Osnay, second son to the Earl of
—,was destined to convince me that
the blind deity reigns with unlimited pow∣er.
To a person, the perfect model of
manly elegance, nature, as if ambitious
to excel herself, had joined the most fault∣less
features. An aquiline nose, a good
complexion, light blue eyes, the most ex∣pressive
imaginable, and a mouth which,
dressed in smiles, rendered him infinitely
charming.” Alas! Miss Montfort, too late
I found</P>
<Q><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
<L>“The gods concealed the little mind,</L>
<L>And earthly thought, beneath a heavenly face,</L>
<L>Forgot the worth that dignifies mankind,</L>
<L>To smooth and polish every outward grace.”</L></Q>
<P>“By frequenting all public places, we
had many opportunities of meeting, and
he acknowledged my wit ensured the heart
my beauty conquered. His conversation
was refined, polite, elegant, spirited, and
sometimes sentimental. His knowledge
was universal, he was master of every sub∣ject,
and discussed each topic with astonish∣ing
facility. Ah, Madam, the extent of
his understanding had but contracted the
sentiments of his heart.”</P>
<P>“My father one morning sent for me to
his closet. I was much surprised at a mes∣sage
so unusual, and immediately obeyed
the summons.”</P>
<P>“Isabella, said he, I have just received a
letter from the Earl of—, who pro∣poses
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
a match between you and Mr. Osnay,
his second son. An offer so advantageous
must not be refused; particularly as his
Lordship intends to give up an estate to his
son, upon the alliance, which will enable him
to settle very handsomely upon you; and
yourt father, my Isabella, does not possess
that fortune he is reputed to have. Dispose
yourself to prove, by a ready compliance
with my commands, that you have a pro∣per
sense of the parental affection I have
always shewn you.—What say you, Isa∣bella,
are you ready to oblige me?”</P>
<P>“I hesitated, I was confused, and a∣shamed
to acknowledge my acquaintance
with, and affection for Mr. Osnay. I assur∣ed
him his command should be his daugh∣ter's
law, and his will regulate her inclina∣tion.
My father appeared perfectly con∣tent,
and I had the satisfaction to see a
glow of pleasure animate that countenance
which had been so long obscured by me∣lancholy.”</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120"/>
“Our house was now the abode of har∣mony,
peace and pleasure. Mr. Osnay's
attentions were, if possible, augmented;
and, eagerly solicitous for what he termed
his happiness, he pressed my father to name
the day that was to complete it.”</P>
<P>“My dear Miss Montfort, how happy
your Isabelia in those halcyon days of inno∣cence,
when every new occurrence brought
additional felicity, and hope gaily smiled
upon futurity!”</P>
<P>“The most unfortunate accident inter∣rupted
this golden dream of bliss. My fa∣ther
frequented the gaming table; and
though his fortune had received many
shocks, he still flatte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed himself the next
throw would reinstate him in his former af∣fluence.”</P>
<P>“He had this day dined with a large
company; and his own spirits were exhili∣rated
by foreign aid. In the beginning of
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
the evening, fortune seemed to smile on
his projects, and the dice were propitious.
Encouraged by this success, he ventured
larger sums, nor found the inconstancy of
the fickle goddess, till it was too late to re∣tract.
Still, however, he hoped another
change, nor could believe himself deceiv∣ed,
till he was convinced his wealth was va∣nished,
his lands mortgaged, and that he
had nothing more to bet.”</P>
<P>“He returned home almost distracted,
confessed his disappointment, and wept for
his Isabella—I begged him to be comforted;
assured him, the misfortune, if he regain∣ed
his chearfulness was trifling, but if aug∣mented
by his sorrows, must for ever de∣stroy
his daughter's peace; that it would
be Mr. Osnay's pride to protect his father,
and our happiness would suffer no interrup∣tion.”</P>
<P>“Ah, my child, said he, there is the
stroke that wounds me. Your exalted
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
mind cannot comprehend the meanness
another may practise. Mr. Osnay's family
will scorn to connect themselves with the
daughter of a ruined gamester; and my
Isabella may prove the innocent victim of
a father's folly.”</P>
<P>“My dear Sir, you know not Mr. Os∣nay,
or you could not harbour a suspicion
of his honour. Noble, generous, disin∣terested;
to him sorrow never mourned un
alleviated, nor want held the supplicating
hand in vain. Can such a man change
with the smiles of fortune, or reject the
worth he loves?”</P>
<P>“My father shook his head, but unwil∣ling
to destroy the pleasing delusion, seem∣ed
to coincide with my opinion, and we
parted for that night.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Osnay's behaviour, the next day,
confirmed my opinion of his honour; and
as he did not mention my father's misfor∣tunes,
we were silent on that topic.”</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123"/>
“He visited for some days as usual, but
methought his affection seemed less fer∣vent,
his intreaties less importunate, and
his visits shorter than before. At last he
totally absented himself for three days.
Imagine my anxiety! Yet still confiding
in his generosity, I attributed his negli∣gence
to some unforeseen accident. Every
knock at the door alarmed me, I expected
this faithless lover, and was repeatedly dis∣appointed.—
Trembling for a lover's
safety, and obliged to hide my concern,
lest it should affect a father's peace, what a
situation was mine! I was at last happily
released from it by the following billet:”</P>
<P>“MY Isabella, how severe those arbi∣trary
commands, which oblige me to
refrain from visiting the woman I adore;
to sigh unpitied, nor once inform her of
my sufferings!—The Earl has heard
your father's ill success, and expects his
son to sacrifice to the trifling considera∣tion
of superior fortune, the happiness
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
of his life: but the lady he has chosen,
shall never dispute my Isabella's title to
my heart. I shall be this evening at
Mrs. M—'s, may I flatter myself you
will meet me there? Come, my love,
oblige with your presence the man who
knows not to be ungrateful. Allow him

is unalterably yours.”</P>

<P>“This billet restored serenity to my
agitated bosom. I had not courage to
shew it to my father, lest he should prevent
our meeting in the evening. I had recourse
to artifice; and by pretending business
with Mrs. M—, for the first time in my
life, practised disguise.”</P>
<P>I found Mr. Osnay had been there long
before me. He received me with trans∣port;
swore that no change of circum∣stance
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
should diminish his affection, nor
even a father's commands oblige him to
desert his Isabella. He proposed a private
marriage; but finding me averse to it,
dropped the design. In short, my dear
Miss Montfort, imagine all the tender
things a heart in love could dictate, and
you may conceive Mr. Osnay's professions.
He would not suffer me to depart, till
he had obtained my promise to meet him
there on the day following.</P>
<P>“From my example, let all young
women avoid the first false step, nor think,
that prudence once silenced will ever re∣sume
her admonitions.”</P>
<P>“New to disguise, I took such pains
to deceive my father, he easily penetrated
my over-acted precautions, and asked if I
had seen Mr. Osnay. I scorned an actual
falsity, acknowledged I had just parted
from him, and put his letter in my father's
hands.”</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"/>
“My Isabella, said he, let us not shew
by the meanness of our conduct that we
merit the misfortunes we sustain. Is it not
better to suffer by a father's rashness; than
by your own imprudence? Scorn to be
the wife of a man, who fears to own you
publickly, and who, only solicitous for
himself, will sacrifice your happiness to his
own convenience.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, Sir, you wrong Mr. Osnay.
I am convinced his love for me is more
fervent than ever; but the Earl, unbiassed
by passion, has chosen a lady of superior
fortune, and insists upon his son's compli∣ance.”</P>
<P>“And can my Isabella connect herself
with a family that despise her? I am con∣vinced
her more unprejudiced thoughts will
disdain the degrading suspicion. She will
remember,” that the “Love of a woman
of sense and virtue, does honour to a
monarch,” and scorn to accept Mr. Os∣nay's
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
hand, unsanctified by parental ap∣probation.
But if honour pleads in vain,
Isabella be not deaf to the calls of interest.
Mr. Osnay is entirely dependant on his fa∣ther,
and marrying contrary to his express
commands, he can expect but a bare sub∣sistence
from his bounty; and it were far
better, my Isabella,</P>
<Q>“Not do the deed, than weep it done.”</Q>
<P>“Happy, Miss Montfort, had I thought
with my father; but this passion seemed
to have debased every sentiment of my
soul. Mr. Osnay assured me that after we
were married the Earl would be readily in∣duced
to forgive; and by a short time ab∣senting
myself from Mrs. M—'s I ima∣gined
I had sufficiently sacrificed to honour.
I resolved to keep my appointments from
my father's knowledge, and since I inform∣ed
Mr. Osnay of my secrecy, his letters
were more frequent, his intreaties for a
private marriage more urgent. Ah, Ma∣dam,
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
in my serious moments, I abhorred
my dissimulation, but ten thousand pleas
tended to silence the reproaches of consci∣ence;
and, by marrying Mr. Osnay, I
hoped to support my father in his former
affluence.”</P>
<P>“This idea, which could have induced
me to rush on misery with transport, was
of infinite force, when it tended to sancti∣fy
the soft inclinations of the heart. I
agreed to go with him to the altar, upon
his promising that I should live with my
father till happier times justified his claim.
This agreement seemed to reconcile my af∣fection
for Mr. Osnay, with my duty to a
parent, and with the most astonishing un∣concern,
I prepared for the important day.”</P>
<P>“I went early in the morning to Mrs.
M—'s, where I met Mr. Osnay, who
had already prepared a clergyman. Un∣fortunately
Mrs. M—was obliged to
attend one of her best customers, who had
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
just sent for her. She refused to go, but I
insisted upon her not hazarding the loss of
the lady's favour for my sake. We had,
therefore, no other witness than a friend
of Mr. Osnay's, who gave him, what he
politely termed, an invaluable treasure.”</P>
<P>“The ceremony was just completed,
when we were surprized by a violent noise
at the door. Mr. Osnay begged me not
to be alarmed, since it could be no other
than some visitors to Mrs. M—. But,
my dear Miss Montfort, judge of my
emotion, when my father, pale, frantic,
disordered, rushed into the room!”</P>
<P>“I had just life enough to hear him de∣clare
I was no longer his daughter, to hear
this offended parent solemnly renounce
me, and sunk senseless on the floor.”</P>
<P>“When I regained my reason, I found
myself on a couch, and Mr. Osnay kneel∣ing
by my side. I enquired for my father,
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
but was told he left the room soon after I
fainted away. I ordered a chair, and in∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted
that Mr. Osnay should keep his pro∣mise
inviolate. He complied more readily
than I could have expected, and I set out
for that peaceful haven I so lately quitted,
but found the doors barred against me.
The servants told me, with tears in their
eyes, their master ordered them, on pain
of his eternal displeasure, to refuse me ad∣mittance;
but assured me that, could they
be of service to me, they should consider
the loss of their place as trifling. Doubt∣ful,
uncertain what to do, I hesitated, when
Mr. Osnay came up to the chair.”</P>
<P>“My Isabella, said he, had you then
rather sustain a father's rage, than trust the
husband who adores you? Your return∣ing,
contrary to his positive injunctions,
will but the more exasperate him. Suffer
me, my love, to conduct you to your own
house. Time will, doubtless, soften a fa∣ther's
heart, and dispose it to receive his
daughter.”</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131"/>
“My father's anger appeared to me
unreasonable. I had married a man infi∣nitely
my superior; and, though without
the Earl's approbation, yet I doubted not,
but through his partiality for a much loved
son, he might be induced to approve his
choice.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Osnay conducted me to a gen∣teel
ready furnished lodging, and endea∣voured,
with the utmost tenderness, to
dissipate my chagrin. Ah, Miss Mont∣fort,
too giddy to reflect, too insensible to
feel for another, I easily forgot a parent's
sufferings: and if, in Mr. Osnay's absence,
an uneasy thought obtruded, I dispelled it
by recollecting the rectitude of my mo∣tives,
and willing at all events to enjoy
the sweets of self-esteem, condemned my
father's pride, and the too rigid principles
of honour, to which he calmly sacrificed
the peaceful joys of domestic happiness.”</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
“At my husband's desire I cultivated
no acquaintance, nor was I visited by any
one. His company, ever new, and ever
agreeable, rendered all other insipid; nor
had I an idea of any pleasure superior to
the charms of his conversation. Indeed,
Miss Montfort, it is impossible to paint my
felicity; I should but shock you with the
ill-drawn likeness. The pleasing dream
still presents itself to my imagination, ar∣rayed
in all the spotless purity of perfect
innocence. Ah, Madam, suffer me to
draw a veil over futurity, nor awaken the
sorrows of a bleeding heart.—But your
desire shall be complied with. Can you,
Madam, still honour with your esteem, the
woman who has forfeited her own, nor
has another claim to the blessing she re∣quests;
but that she is unfortunate, and
that it is Miss Montfort's glory to succour
the distressed, and by <HI>her</HI> regard fully over∣pay
the cruelty of an ill-judging world?”</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133"/>
“Mr. Osnay's love seemed unabated;
and had my father's consent sanctified my
happiness, it had anticipated the joys of
heaven—Ah, Madam, how sweet the
flattering deception!”</P>
<P>“The Earl and his family came to
town for the winter, and Mr. Osnay was
consequently less with me than formerly:
yet he appeared to mourn our frequent se∣paration,
and shared in the anxiety his ab∣sence
occasioned me.”</P>
<P>“I passed some weeks, still satisfied with
my husband, yet I thought his visits to the
earl much longer, and his too sedulous at∣tention
inconsistent with what he owed his
wife.”</P>
<P>“He was obliged to accompany his fa∣mily
in an expedition for a few days, but
was absent longer than he proposed. In
time his excursions became so frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
that I ventured gently to remonstrate. He
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
was enraged, swore he would not rein his
pleasures to procure the happiness of a
peevish, ungrateful beauty, nor maintain a
constancy returned but with reproach.”</P>
<P>“In vain I endeavoured to pacify him:
this husband, so much beloved, so gentle,
so engaging, was deaf to my entreaties:
and, notwithstanding my efforts to detain
him, quitted the house, declaring he would
never see me more.—I blamed myself
for irritating a temper unused to restraint,
but considered his anger meerly temporary,
and doubted not but that in a short time I
should see a repentant husband at my feet.”</P>
<P>“Some time, however, passed, and I
heard nothing of him. I began, indeed,
to be alarmed, and sent my maid to the
Earl's to ask if Mr. Osnay was in town. I
waited her return with the most anxious
impatience. She brought word, that the
house was in the utmost confusion; and
when she enquired whether Mr. Osnay was
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
in town, the servants laughed at the ques∣tion.”</P>
<P>“What could I think of this account? I
knew my husband's temper was violent,
but I thought him incapable of resenting
an injury he no longer felt, and was cer∣tain
my submissions, even supposing I of∣fended,
had amply attoned the fault.
That he should have purposely picked a
quarrel, meerly as an excuse to absent him∣self
from me, was what my pride would
not suffer me to believe, how then could
he be in London, and yet avoid his Isabel∣la?
To release myself from these morti∣fying
reflections, I called for the news∣paper.
Ah, Miss Montfort, think what I
suffered when the first paragraph I read
confirmed Mr. Osnay's infidelity, and in∣formed
the public,” “Yesterday was mar∣ried,
at St. James's church, the Honour∣able
Mr. Osnay, second son to the Earl
of—, to Lady Mary Fitzgerald.”</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
“I could read no further, the paper
dropped from my trembling hand, and I
sunk lifeless in Betty's arms. As soon as I
recovered, I sent her once more to the
Earl's, and insisted on her not returning
till she had seen Mr. Osnay.—May-you,
Madam, never experience, even in idea,
the pangs I then endured. I knew myself
his wife, and resolved no longer to disguise
it, but affert my prior claim.”</P>
<P>“Betty returned. She had not been
long at the Earl's before a carriage stopped
at the door, and Mr. Osnay handed out
his bride.”</P>
<P>“This faithful girl took care to place
herself where they were inevitably obliged
to pass. Mr. Osnay started at the fight of
her, dropped Lady Mary's hand, and,
conducting her to a room, immediately
returned to Betty, and reprimanded her
for daring to intrude and observe his con∣duct.
She represented my situation, and
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
with artless eloquence painted my love and
sufferings. He appeared affected with the
melancholy recital, and putting some gold
into her hand,” “Tell my Isabella,” said
he, “she has still a lover;” and hurried
from her.</P>
<P>“The servants confirmed the truth of
his marriage; and yet, still confiding in
this dear perfidious, I could not credit the
account. My heart bore testimony to his
innocence, while my deluded understand∣ing
realized impossibilities, and confirmed
the sweet illusion. Ah, Madam, this
cruel destroyer of my happiness, envious
even of the little I possessed, by the fol∣lowing
billet confirmed his falsehood, and
reduced me to the painful necessity of tear-his
faithful image from my heart, and with
it each chearful prospect of felicity.”</P>
