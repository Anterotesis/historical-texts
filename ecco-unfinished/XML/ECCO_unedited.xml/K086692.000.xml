<HEAD>PREFACE TO Mr. <HI>POPE</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>BOUT two Years ago, upon a slight Mis∣apprehension of some Expressions of yours, which my Resentment, or perhaps my Pride, interpreted to the Disadvantage of a Poetical Trifle, I had then newly publish'd, I suffer'd myself to be unreasonably transported, so far, as to inscribe you an angry, and incon∣siderate Preface; without previous Examina∣tion into the Justness of my Proceeding. I have lately had the Mortification to learn from your own Hand, that you were en∣tirely guiltless of the Fact charg'd upon you; so that, in attempt∣ing to retaliate a suppos'd Injury, I have done a real Injustice.</P>
<P>The only Thing which an honest Man ought to be more asham'd of than his Faults, is a Reluctance against confessing them. I have already acknowledg'd mine to yourself: But no publick Guilt is well aton'd, by a private Satisfaction; I there∣fore send you a Duplicate of my Letter, by way of the World, that all, who remember my Offence, may also witness my Re∣pentance.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG></HI> AM under the greatest Confusion I ever felt in my Life, to find by your Letter, that I have been guilty of a Crime, which I can never forgive <HI>Myself,</HI> were it for no other Reason, than that <HI>You</HI> have forgiven it. I might have learnt from your Writings the Extent of your Soul, and shou'd have concluded it impossible for the Author of those elevated Sentiments, to sink beneath them in his Practice.</P>
<P>You are generously moderate, when you mitigate my Guilt, and mis∣call it a <HI>Credulity;</HI> 'twas a passionate, and most unjustifiable <HI>Levity,</HI> and must still have remain'd unpardonable, whatever Truth might have been found in its mistaken Occasion.</P>
<P>What stings me most, in my Reflection on this Folly, is, that I know not how to <HI>atone</HI> it; I will endeavour it, however; being always asham'd, when I have attempted to revenge an Injury, but never more proud, than when I have begg'd Pardon for an Error.</P>
<P>If you needed an Inducement to the strengthening your Forgiveness, you might gather it from these two Considerations; <HI>First,</HI> The Crime was almost a Sin against Conviction; for though not happy enough to know you personally, your <HI>Mind</HI> had been my intimate Acquaintance, and regarded with a kind of partial Tenderness, that made it little less than Miracle, that I attempted to offend you. A sudden Warmth, to which, by Nature, I am much too liable, transported me to a Condition, I shall best describe in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Sense, somewhere or other.</P>
<Q><L>Blind in th' obscuring Mist of heedless Rage,</L>
<L>I've rashly shot my Arrows o'er a House,</L>
<L>And hurt my Brother.—</L></Q>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Consideration is, the Occasion you have gather'd to punish my Injustice, with more than double Sharpness, by your Manner of receiving it. The Armour of your Mind is temper'd so <HI>divinely,</HI> that my mere <HI>Human</HI> Weapons have not only fail'd to pierce, but broke to pieces in rebounding. You meet Assaults, like some expert <HI>Arabian,</HI> who, declining any Use of his own Javelin, arrests those which come against him, in the Fierceness of their Motion, and overcomes his Ene∣mies, by detaining their own Weapons. 'Tis a noble Triumph you now exercise, by the Superiority of your Nature; and while I see you looking down upon the Distance of my Frailty, I am forc'd to <HI>own</HI> a Glory, which I <HI>envy</HI> you; and am quite asham'd of the poor Figure I am making, in the bottom of the Prospect. I <HI>feel,</HI> I am sure, Re∣morse,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
enough to satisfy you for the Wrong, but to <HI>express</HI> it, wou'd, I think, exceed even <HI>your own</HI> Power.</P>
<Q><L>Yours, whose sweet Songs can rival <HI>Orpheu</HI>'s Strain,</L>
<L>And force the wondring Woods to dance again,</L>
<L>Make moving Mountains hear your pow'rful Call,</L>
<L>And headlong Streams hang list'ning in their Fall.</L></Q>
<P>No Words can be worthy to come after these; I will therefore hasten to tell you, that I am, and will ever be, with the greatest Truth and Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your Most Humble, and Most Obedient Servant,</HI> A. HILL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I have now attempted, as far as I am able, to throw off a Weight, which my Mind has been uneasy under. I cannot say, in the City Phrase, that I have <HI>balanc'd the Account</HI>, but you must admit of Composition, where full Payment is impossible. I shall be so far from regretting you the old Benefit of <HI>Lex tali∣onis</HI>, that I forgive you heartily, beforehand, for any thing you may hereafter think fit to say, or do, to my Disadvantage; nay, the Pleasure I enjoy by reflecting on your good Nature, will de∣generate to a <HI>Pain</HI>, if one Accident or other, in the Course of your Life, does not favour me with some Occasion of advancing your Interest.</P>
<P>Having said thus much to you, in your Quality of a <HI>Good Man</HI>, I will proceed to address you, in your other Quality, of a <HI>Great Poet</HI>; in which Light I look up to you with extraordinary Com∣fort, as to a new Constellation breaking out upon our World, with equal Heat, and Brightness, and cross-spangling, as it were, the whole Heaven of Wit with your milky way of Genius.</P>
<P>You cou'd never have been born at a Time, which more want∣ed the Influence of your Example: All the Fire you bring with you, and the Judgment you are acquiring, in the Course of your Journey, will be put to their full Stress, to support and rebuild the sinking Honours of Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>It was a Custom, which prevail'd generally among the Anci∣ents, to impute Celestial Descent to their Heroes; The Vanity, methinks, might have been pardonable, and rational, if apply'd to an Art; since Arts, when they are at once delightful and pro∣fitable, as you will certainly leave <HI>Poetry</HI>, have one real Mark of <HI>Divinity</HI>, they become, in some measure, <HI>immortal</HI>. And as the oldest, and, I think, the sublimest Poem in the World, is of <HI>He∣brew</HI> Original, and was made immediately after passing the Red-Sea, at a Time, when the Author had neither Leisure, nor Possibility, to invent a new Art: It must therefore be undeniable, either that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> brought Poetry out of <HI>Egypt</HI>, or that <HI>Moses</HI> receiv'd it from God, by immediate <HI>Inspiration</HI>. This last, being what a Poet should be fondest of believing, I wou'd fain suppose it probable, that God, who was pleas'd to instruct <HI>Moses</HI> with what Ceremony he wou'd be worship'd, taught him also a Mode of Thinking, and expressing Thought, unprophan'd by vulgar Use, and peculiar to that Worship. God then taught Poetry first to the <HI>Hebrews</HI>, and the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to Mankind in ge∣neral.</P>
<P>But, however this may have been, there is, apparently, a di∣vine Spirit, glowing forcibly in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poetry, a kind of terrible Simplicity! a magnificent Plainness! which is commonly lost, in Paraphrase, by our mistaken Endeavours after heighten∣ing the Sentiments, by a figurative Expression; This is very ill judg'd: The little Ornaments of Rhetorick might serve, fortu∣nately enough, to swell out the Leanness of some <HI>modern</HI> Com∣positions; but to shadow over the Lustre of a divine <HI>Hebrew</HI> Thought, by an Affectation of <HI>enliv'ning</HI> it, is to <HI>paint</HI> upon a <HI>Diamond</HI>, and call it an <HI>Ornament</HI>.</P>
<P>It is a surprizing Reflection, that these noble <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poets shou'd have written with such admirable Vigour three Thousand Years ago; and that, instead of improving, we shou'd affect to despise them; as if, to write <HI>smoothly</HI>, and without the Spirit of <HI>Imagery</HI>, were the true Art of Poetry, because the only Art we practise. It puts me in Mind of the famous <HI>Roman</HI> Lady, who suppos'd, that Men had, <HI>naturally</HI>, stinking Breaths, because she had been us'd to it, in her Husband.</P>
<P>The most obvious Defect in our Poetry, and I think the great∣est it is liable to, is, that we study <HI>Form</HI>, and neglect <HI>Matter</HI>. We are often very flowing, and under a full Sail of Words, while we leave our Sense fast aground, as too <HI>weighty</HI> to float on <HI>Frothiness</HI>; We run on, upon false Scents, like a Spaniel, that starts away at Random after a Stone, which is kept back in the Hand, though it seem'd to fly before him. To speak with Freedom on this
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Subject, is a Task of more Danger than Honour; for few Minds have real Greatness enough to consider a Detection of their Er∣rors, as a Warning to their Conduct, and an Advantage to their Fame; But no discerning Judgment will consider it as ill Nature, in one Writer, to mark the Faults of another. A general Prac∣tice of that Kind wou'd be the highest Service to Poetry. No Disease can be cur'd, till its Nature is examin'd; and the first likely Step towards correcting our Errors, is resolving to learn impartially, that we have Errors to be corrected.</P>
<P>I will therefore, with much Freedom, but no manner of Ma∣lice, remark an Instance or two, from no mean Writers, to prove, that our Poetry has been degenerating apace into mere <HI>Sound</HI>, or <HI>Harmony</HI>; nor ought This to be consider'd as an invidious At∣tempt, since whatever Pains we take, about polishing our <HI>Num∣bers</HI>, where we raise not our <HI>Meaning</HI>, are as impertinently be∣stowed, as the Labour wou'd be, of setting a broken Leg after the Soul has left the Body. The Gunners have a Custom, when a Ball is too little for the Bore of their Canon, to wrap <HI>Towe</HI> about it, till it fills the Mouth of the Piece; after which, it is discharg'd, with a Thunder, proportionable to the Size of the Gun; But its Execution at the Mark, will immediately discover, that the Noise of the Discharge was a great deal too big for the Diameter of the Bullet. It is just the same thing with an un∣sinewy Imagination, sent abroad in sounding Numbers; The Lof∣tiness of the Expression will astonish shallow Readers into a tem∣porary Admiration, and support it, for a while; but the Bounce, however loud, goes no farther than the <HI>Ear</HI>; The <HI>Heart</HI> remains unreach'd by the Languor of the Sentiment.</P>
<P>Poetry, the most elevated Exertion of human Wit, is no more than a weak and contemptible Amusement, wanting Energy of Thought, or Propriety of Expression. Yet we may run into Er∣ror, by an injudicious Affectation of attaining Perfection, as Men, who are gazing upward, when they shou'd be looking to their Footsteps, stumble frequently against Posts, while they have the Sun in Contemplation.</P>
<P>In attempting, for Example, to modernize so lofty an Ode as the 104th <HI>Psalm</HI>, the Choice of Metaphors shou'd, methinks, have been considered, as one of the most remarkable Difficulties. There seems to have been a Necessity, that they shou'd be noble, as well as natural; and yet, if too much <HI>rais'd</HI>, they wou'd en∣danger an <HI>Extinction</HI> of the Charms, which they were design'd to <HI>illustrate</HI>. That powerful Imagination of <HI>the Sea, climbing over the Mountains Tops, and rushing back, upon the Plains, at the Voice of God's Thunder</HI>, ought certainly to have been express'd with as
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
much <HI>Plainness</HI> as possible: And, to demonstrate how ill the con∣trary Measure has succeeded, one need only observe how it looks in Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>'s Metaphorical Refinement.</P>
<Q><L>"The <HI>Ebbing</HI> Deluge did its <HI>Troops</HI> recal,</L>
<L>"<HI>Drew off</HI> its <HI>Forces,</HI> and disclos'd the Ball,</L>
<L>"They, at th' Eternal's <HI>Signal march'd</HI> away.</L></Q>
<P>Who does not discern, in this Place, what an Injury is done to the original Image, by the military Metaphor? Recalling the <HI>Troops</HI> of a Deluge, <HI>Drawing off</HI> its <HI>Forces</HI>; and its <HI>Marching</HI> away, at a <HI>Signal</HI>, carry not only a visible Impropriety of Thought, but are infinitely below the Majesty of That God, who is so dreadfully represented thundering his Commands to the Ocean; They are directly the Reverse of that terrible Confusion, and overwhelming Uproar of Motion, which the Sea, in the Origi∣nal, is suppos'd to fall into. The March of an Army is <HI>pleasing, orderly, slow</HI>; The Inundation of a Sea, from the Tops of the Mountains, <HI>frightful, wild</HI> and <HI>tumultuous</HI>; Every Justness and Grace of the original Conception is destroyed by the Metaphor.</P>
<P>In the same <HI>Psalm</HI>, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poet describing God, says, —<HI>He maketh the Clouds his Chariots, and walketh on the Wings of the Wind</HI>. Making the <HI>Clouds</HI> his <HI>Chariots</HI>, is a strong and lively Thought; But That of <HI>walking on the Wings of the Wind</HI>, is a Sublimity, that <HI>frightens, astonishes</HI>, and <HI>ravishes</HI> the Mind of a Reader, who conceives it, as he shou'd do. The Judgment of the Poet in this Place, is discernable in three different Particu∣lars; The Thought is in itself highly noble, and elevated; To move at all upon the Wind, carries with it an Image of much Majesty and Terror; But this natural Grandeur he first encreas'd by the Word <HI>Wings</HI>, which represents the Motion, as not only on the <HI>Winds</HI>, but on the Winds in their utmost <HI>Violence</HI>, and <HI>Rapidity</HI> of <HI>Agitation</HI>. But then at last, comes that finishing Sublimity, which attends the Word <HI>walks!</HI> The Poet is not satis∣fied to represent God, as <HI>riding</HI> on the Winds; nor even as riding on them in a <HI>Tempest</HI>; He therefore tells us, that He <HI>walks</HI> on their <HI>Wings</HI>; that so our Idea might be heighten'd to the utmost, by reflecting on this <HI>calm</HI>, and <HI>easy</HI> Motion of the Deity, upon a Violence, so <HI>rapid</HI>, so <HI>furious</HI>, and <HI>ungovernable</HI>, to our human Conception. Yet as nothing can be more <HI>sublime</HI>, so nothing can be more <HI>simple</HI>, and plain, than this noble Imagination. But Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>, not contented to <HI>express</HI>, attempts unhappily to <HI>adorn</HI> this inimitable Beauty, in the following Manner.</P>
<Q><PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
<L>"Who, borne in Triumph o'er the Heavenly <HI>Plains,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Rides</HI> on the <HI>Clouds,</HI> and holds a Storm in <HI>Reins,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Flies</HI> on the <HI>Wings</HI> of the sonorous <HI>Wind,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Here his imperfect, and diminishing Metaphor, of the <HI>Reins</HI>, has quite ruin'd the Image; What rational, much less noble Idea, can any Man conceive of a Wind in a Bridle? The unlucky Word <HI>Plains</HI> too, is a downright Contradiction to the Meaning of the Passage. What wider Difference in Nature, than between driv∣ing a Chariot over a Plain, and moving enthron'd, amidst That rolling, and terrible Perplexity of Motions, which we figure to our Imagination, from a <HI>Chariot</HI> of <HI>Clouds?</HI> But the mistaken Embellishment of the Word <HI>flies</HI>, in the last Verse, is an Error almost unpardonable; Instead of improving the Conception, it has made it trifling, and contemptible, and utterly destroy'd the very Soul of its Energy! <HI>flies</HI> on the Wind! What an Image is That, to express the Majesty of God? To <HI>walk</HI> on the Wind is astonishing, and horrible; But to <HI>fly</HI> on the Wind, is the Em∣ployment of a <HI>Bat</HI>, of an <HI>Owl</HI>, of a <HI>Feather!</HI> Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI> is, I believe, a Gentleman of so much Candour, and so true a Friend to the Interest of the Art he <HI>professes</HI>, that there will be no Oc∣casion to ask his Pardon, for dragging a Criminal Metaphor, or two, out of the Immunity of his Protection.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> has lately been told in Print, by one of our best Criticks, that he has excell'd all the Ancients, in his Pastoral Writings; He will, therefore, be apt to wonder, that I take the Liberty to say, in downright Respect to Truth, and the Justice due to Poetry, that I have not only seen modern Pastorals, much better than <HI>His</HI>, but that his appear, to me, neither <HI>natural</HI>, nor <HI>equal</HI>. One might extend this Remark to the very Names of his Shepherds; <HI>Lobbin, Hobbinol</HI>, and <HI>Cuddy</HI> are nothing of a Piece, with <HI>Lanquet, Mico</HI>, and <HI>Argol</HI>; nor do his Personages agree bet∣ter with themselves, than their <HI>Names</HI> with one another. <HI>Mico</HI>, for Example, at the first Sight we have of him, is a very polite Speaker, and as metaphorical as Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"This Place may seem for Shepherds Leisure made,</L>
<L>"So <HI>lovingly</HI> these Elms <HI>unite their Shade!</HI></L>
<L>"Th' <HI>ambitious Woodbine!</HI> how it <HI>climbs, to breathe</HI></L>
<L>"Its <HI>balmy Sweets</HI> around, on all beneath!</L></Q>
<P>But, alas! this Fit of Eloquence, like most other Blessings, is of very short Continuance; It holds him but just one Speech: In
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
the beginning of the next, he is as very a Rustick, as <HI>Colin Clout</HI>, and has forgot all his Breeding.</P>
<Q><L>"No Skill of Musick can I, simple Swain,</L>
<L>"No fine Device, <HI>thine Ear</HI> to entertain;</L>
<L>"Albeit <HI>some deal</HI> I pipe, <HI>rude</HI> though it <HI>be,</HI></L>
<L>"Sufficient to <HI>divert</HI> my <HI>Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Me</HI>.</L></Q>
<P>There is no Transformation in <HI>Ovid</HI> more sudden, or surpriz∣ing; He has Reason indeed to say, that, when he <HI>pipes some deal</HI>, his <HI>Sheep</HI> are <HI>diverted</HI> with him. His <HI>Readers</HI>, I am afraid too, are as merry as his <HI>Sheep</HI>; If he was but as skilful in Change of <HI>Tune</HI>, as he is in Change of <HI>Dialect</HI>, commend me to him for a Musician! The pied Piper, who drew all the Rats of a City out, after his Melody, came not near him for Variety.</P>
<P>If the late excellent Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>, whose Verses abound in Graces, which can never be too much admir'd, shall be, often, found liable to an Overflow of his Meaning, by this Dropsical Wordiness, which we so generally give into, it will serve at the same time, as a Comfort, and a Warning; and incline us to a severe Examination of our Writings, when we venture out upon a World, that will, one time or other, be sure to censure us im∣partially; In That Gentleman's Works, whoever looks close, will discover <HI>Thorns</HI> on every Branch of his <HI>Roses</HI>; For Example, we all hear, with Delight, in his celebrated Letter from <HI>Italy</HI>, that, there,
<Q><L>—The Muse so <HI>oft</HI> her Harp has strung,</L>
<L>That not a Mountain rears its Head unsung.</L></Q></P>
<P>But he adds, in the very next Line, that every shady <HI>Thicket</HI> too, grows renown'd in Verse; now one can never help remem∣bring, that <HI>Thickets</HI> are Births, as it were of Yesterday; the mere <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Woods!</HI> and that the <HI>oldest Woods</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> may be grow∣ing on Foundations of ruin'd Cities, which flourish'd in the Times he there speaks of; whence it must naturally be inferr'd, that to say, the <HI>Italian Thickets</HI> grow renown'd in <HI>Roman Verse</HI>, though the <HI>Mountains</HI> really do so, is to make Use of <HI>Words</HI>, without Regard to their Meaning; A Lapse of dangerous Con∣sequence, because, when the Understanding is once shock'd, this most rapturous Elevation of the Mind (as when <HI>cold</HI> Water is thrown suddenly upon <HI>boiling</HI>) sinks at once to chilling Flatness, and is considered as mere Gingle and childish Amusement.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10"/>No Man, I believe, has read without Pleasure, his fine and lively Descriptions of the <HI>Nar, Clitumnus, Mincio</HI>, and <HI>Albula</HI>, but the worst of it is, he winds us so long, in and out, between these Rivers, that he loses himself in their Maeanders, and brings us, at last, to a strange Stream indeed, which is <HI>immortaliz'd in Song</HI>, and yet <HI>lost in Oblivion</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"I look for Streams, <HI>immortaliz'd,</HI> in Song,</L>
<L>"Which <HI>lost,</HI> and <HI>buried</HI> in <HI>Oblivion</HI> lie.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Thought</HI>, in this Place, is very lively, and just, but quite obscur'd by the Redundancy and Wantonness of the Expression. Had he only said <HI>lost</HI>, and <HI>buried</HI>, it might have been urg'd, that the Rivers were dry'd up, and no longer to be found, in their old Channels. But, let them be lost, as to <HI>Existence</HI>, as certain∣ly as he will, they can never be lost in <HI>Oblivion</HI>, if they are <HI>im∣mortaliz'd</HI> in Poetry. <HI>Immortal</HI> is a favourite Word in this Gen∣tleman's Writings and leads him, as most Favourites are apt to do, into very frequent Errors.</P>
<P>It is naturally unpleasant, to be detain'd too long in the Mazi∣ness of one tedious Thought, express'd many Ways successively. When we read that the <HI>Tiber is destitute of Strength</HI>, what else can we conclude, but that its Stream is a weak one? But we are oblig'd to hear, also, that it <HI>derives its Source from an unthrifty Urn:</HI> Well, <HI>now</HI>, may we go on? No; its <HI>Urn</HI> is not only <HI>unthrifty</HI>, but its <HI>Source</HI> is <HI>unfruitful</HI>. By this time, one can scarce help enquiring, what <HI>new Meaning</HI> is convey'd to the Apprehension, by the Mul∣tiplication of the Phrases? And not finding <HI>any</HI>, we have no Re∣flection to satisfy ourselves with, but, that the <HI>strongest</HI> Flow of Fancy, is most subject to <HI>Whirlpools</HI>.</P>
<P>It is from the same unweigh'd Redundancy, and Misapplica∣tion of Words, that we so often find this excellent Writer falling into the <HI>Anticlimax</HI>. As where, for Example, he informs us of <HI>Liberty</HI>, that she is a Goddess,
<Q><L>"<HI>Profuse</HI> of <HI>Bliss,</HI> and <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight,</HI></L>
<L>"Eternal <HI>Pleasures,</HI> in her Presence reign.</L></Q></P>
<P>After <HI>Profusion</HI> of <HI>Bliss</HI>, that is to say, the heap'd Enjoyment of all Blessings to be wish'd for; how does it <HI>cool</HI> the Imagination, to read of being <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight?</HI> Had she been <HI>brought to Bed of Delight</HI>, it had been but a poor Delivery: For what im∣ports <HI>Delight</HI>, in Comparison with <HI>Bliss?</HI> And how much less too is <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight</HI>, than <HI>Delight</HI> in <HI>Possession!</HI> But then
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
again, after both these, what cou'd the Author hope to teach us, by adding, that <HI>Pleasure reigns in her Presence</HI>. Can there be <HI>Bliss</HI> without <HI>Delight?</HI> Was there ever <HI>Delight</HI> without <HI>Pleasure?</HI> It shou'd gradually have ascended thus, <HI>Pleasure, Delight, Bliss</HI>; But to turn it the direct contrary Way, <HI>Bliss, Delight, Pleasure</HI>, is setting a poor Meaning upon its Head, and the same thing as to say, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> writ <HI>incomparably, finely</HI>, nay, and <HI>tolerably</HI>. A Praise, which, I dare say, he wou'd have given no Body Thanks for. One wou'd think there were a kind of Fatality in <HI>Liberty</HI>, since scarce any Body can meddle either with the Word or the Thing, but they turn all topsey turvey.</P>
<P>But I am sliding insensibly into a Theme, that requires rather a Volume, than a Page or two; I hasten therefore to present you a Paraphrase on the Six Days Work of the Creator, as described to us by <HI>Moses</HI>, in the First Chapter of <HI>Genesis</HI>, which, you know, was written, originally, in Verse. It wou'd be difficult, I am sure, to match the Greatness of that inspired Author's Images, out of all the noble Writings, which have honour'd Antiquity; and whose most remarkable Excellencies have been found, in those Parts of their Works, which they elevated, and made more solemn, by a Mixture of their <HI>Religion</HI>. Our Poetry, in so able a Hand as <HI>Yours</HI>, might receive heavenly Advantages, from a Practice of like Nature. But I am of Opinion, that no <HI>English</HI> Verse, except that, which we, I think a little improperly, call <HI>Pindaric</HI>, can allow the necessary Scope, to so masterless a Sub∣ject, as the <HI>Creation</HI>, of all others the most copious, and illustri∣ous; and which ought to be touch'd with most Discretion, and Choice of Circumstance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>, Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>, and now, late∣ly, a young Gentleman, of a very lively Genius, have severally tried their Strength in this celestial Bow; Sir <HI>Richard</HI> may be said indeed to have shot <HI>farthest</HI>, but too often beside the Mark; He Will permit me the Liberty of owning my Opinion, that he is too minute, and particular, and rather labours to oppress us with every Image he cou'd raise, than to refresh and enliven us, with the noblest, and most differing. He is also too unmindful of the Dignity of his Subject, and diminishes it by mean, and contemp∣tible Metaphors. Speaking of the Skies, he says they were
<Q><HI>Spun</HI> thin, and <HI>wove,</HI> on Nature's finest <HI>Loom</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Longinus</HI> is very angry with <HI>Timaeus</HI> for saying of <HI>Alexander</HI>, that he conquer'd all <HI>Asia</HI>, in less Time than <HI>Isocrates</HI> took to write his <HI>Panegyric</HI>,

What then wou'd he have said of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Metaphorical Compari∣son of the CREATOR <HI>Himself</HI>, to a <HI>Spinster</HI>, and a <HI>Weaver?</HI> The very <HI>Beasts</HI> of Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>, who kept <HI>Moses</HI> in his Eye, carry in∣finitely more Majesty, than the Skies of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>The grassy <HI>Clods</HI> now <HI>calv'd;</HI> and half appear'd</L>
<L>The tawny <HI>Lyon,</HI> pawing to get <HI>free</HI></L>
<L>His hinder <HI>Parts;</HI> then <HI>springs,</HI> as broke from Bonds,</L>
<L>And, <HI>rampant,</HI> shakes <HI>aloft,</HI> his brinded Main!</L>
<L>The heaving <HI>Leopard,</HI> rising, like the <HI>Mole,</HI></L>
<L>In Heaps the <HI>crumbling Earth</HI> about him <HI>threw!</HI></L></Q>
<P>These animated Images, or pictured Meanings of Poetry, are the forcible Inspirers, which enflame a Reader's Will, and bind down his Attention. They arise from <HI>living Words</HI>, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls them; that is, from Words so finely chosen, and so justly ranged, that they call up before a Reader the Spirit of their Sense, in that very Form, and Action, it impressed upon the Writer. But when the Idea, which a Poet strives to raise, is in itself mag∣nificent and striking, the Dawb of Metaphor, or any spumy Colourings of Rhetoric can but deaden, and efface it.</P>
<P>If Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had said, concerning the Skies, on any other Subject but This, of the <HI>Creation</HI>, that they were <HI>spun thin, and wove, on Nature's finest Loom</HI>, the Thought had been so far from Impropriety, as to have been pleasing, and praise-worthy; But when the Image he wou'd set before us, is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, in all the dreadful Majesty of his Omnipotence, pro∣ducing at a Word, the noblest Part of the Creation, and <HI>spread∣ing out the Heavens as a Curtain</HI>; In this tremendous Exercise of his Divinity, to compare him to a <HI>Weaver</HI>, and his Expansion of the Skies, to the low Mechanism of a <HI>Loom</HI>, is injudiciously to <HI>di∣minish</HI> an Idea, he pretends to <HI>heighten</HI> and <HI>illustrate</HI>.</P>
<P>I will end with a Word or two concerning the different Measure of the Verse, in which the following Poem is written; and which is apt to disgust Readers not well grounded in Poetry, because it requires a fuller Degree of Attention than the Couplet, and, as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> has said of it,
<Q><L>—Will no <HI>unskilful Touch</HI> endure,</L>
<L>But flings <HI>Writer</HI> and <HI>Reader</HI> too, that sits not sure.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have, in another Place, endeavoured by Arguments to de∣monstrate the Preference of this Kind of Verse to any other; I
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
will here observe only, from my Experience of other Writers, that it wins, insinuates, and grows insensibly upon the Relish of a Reader, till the little seeming Harshness, which is supposed to be in it, softens gradually away, and leaves a vigorous Impression behind it, of mixed Majesty and Sweetness.</P>
<P>A Man, who is just beginning to try his Ear in <HI>Pindaric</HI>, may be compared to a new <HI>Scater</HI>; He totters strangely at first, and staggers backward and forward; Every Stick, or frozen Stone in his Way, is a Rub that he falls at. But when many repeated Trials have embolden'd him to strike out, and taught the true Poize of Motion, he throws forward his Body with a dextrous Velocity, and becoming ravish'd with the masterly Sweep of his Windings, knows no Pleasure greater, than to feel himself fly through that well-measured Maziness, which he first attempted with Perplexity. But I will detain you no longer, and hasten now to the Poem, which has given me this pleasing Opportunity of telling you how much I am,</P>
