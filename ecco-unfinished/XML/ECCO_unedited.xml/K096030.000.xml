THE DISCOVERY: A COMEDY.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Female culprit at your bar appears,</L>
<L>Not destitute of hope, nor free from fears.</L>
<L>Her utmost crimes she's ready to confess,</L>
<L>A simple trespass—neither more nor less;</L>
<L>For, truant-like, she rambled out of bounds,</L>
<L>And dar'd to venture on poetic grounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fault is deem'd high-treason by the men,</L>
<L>Those lordly tyrants who usurp the pen!</L>
<L>Then try the vile monopoly to hide</L>
<L>With flattering arts, 'You, ladies, have beside</L>
<L>'So many ways to conquer—sure 'tis fit</L>
<L>'You leave to us that dangerous weapon wit!"</L>
<L>For women, like state criminals, they think</L>
<L>Should be debarr'd the use of pen and ink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our author, who disclaims such partial laws,</L>
<L>To her own sex appeals to judge her cause.</L>
<L>She pleads old magna charta on her side,</L>
<L>That British subjects by their peers be try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies, to you she dedicates her lays,</L>
<L>Assert your right to censure or to praise;</L>
<L>Nor doubt a sentence by such lips decreed,</L>
<L>Firm as the laws of Persian or of Mede;</L>
<L>Boldly your will in open court declare,</L>
<L>And let the men dispute it if they dare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our humble scenes no charms of art can boast,</L>
<L>But simple nature, and plain sense at most:</L>
<L>Perhaps some character—a moral too—</L>
<L>And what is stranger still—the story's new:</L>
<L>No borrow'd thoughts throughout the piece are shewn,</L>
<L>But what our author writes is all her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By no sly hint, or incident she tries</L>
<L>To bid on modest cheeks the blush arise:</L>
<L><PB REF="30"/>
The loosest thoughts our decent scenes suggest,</L>
<L>Virtue herself might harbour in her breast;</L>
<L>And where our harmless satire vents its spleen,</L>
<L>The soberest prude may laugh, without a skreen.</L>
<L>But not to mirth alone we claim your ear,</L>
<L>Some tender scenes demand the melting tear;</L>
<L>The comic dame, her different powers to prove,</L>
<L>Gives you the dear variety you love;</L>
<L>Sometimes assumes her graver sister's art,</L>
<L>Borrows her form, and tries to touch the heart,</L>
<L>But fancy's pictures float upon the brain,</L>
<L>And short-liv'd o'er the heart is passion's reign,</L>
<L>Till judgment stamp her sanction on the whole,</L>
<L>And sink th'impression deep into the soul.—</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Lady</HI> Medway.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW's this, madam? pursue me into my study! my sanctuary! I thought this place, at least, was to be considered by your Lady∣ship as inviolable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I don't interrupt you, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be glad, lady Medway, that we remember'd our respective bounds. I never intrude at your tea-table or toilet; and I desire my hours of retirement may be held as sa∣cred by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, my Lord, but indeed you have made me so exceedingly unhappy by this sudden resolution you have taken, in regard to marrying your daughter, that I can find rest no where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you are come, like the evil spirit, to take pos∣session of me, in order to make me as restless as yourself. I am really extremely obliged to your Ladyship; but you must know, ma'am, I am of so strange a disposition, that I have an absolute dislike to the being made uneasy; and therefore shall take it as a favour, if you will either, at once, chearfully acqui∣esce in what I have determined, or else go, and display your
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
plaintive eloquence to some one better disposed to sympathize with you than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you know your will has ever been a law to me; but I beg of you to consider the cruelty of forcing young people to marry against their inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I did not <HI>expect</HI> this idle opposition from you, especially when you know my motives to this marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you have not yet explained them to me; I can only guess at large.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I am harassed with debts, and I now tell you, I don't know where to raise five hundred pounds more, if it would save me from perdition; and pray, let me ask your Ladyship, do you know any one besides Sir Anthony Branville, who will take your daughter without a fortune? for I neither am, nor probably ever shall be, able to give her one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Louisa is very young, my Lord; why need we be so precipitate? Besides, if this match between Mrs. Knight∣ly and your son should take place, it will then be in your pow∣er to provide for your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right <HI>woman!—</HI>a hint is but just started, and you pursue, run it down, and seize it at once. I have not yet pro∣posed the thing to my son. Perhaps he may not like the lady when I do; and I presume you will think <HI>his</HI> inclinations as proper to be consulted, as those of the young lady his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my Lord,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no doubt on't; love-matches against the world! All you ladies, in this particular, are very ready to adhere to that christian precept, of doing as you would be done by: and so I suppose, you, out of your maternal fondness, would re∣commend it to me to let Miss please herself in the choice of a husband, as her mamma did before her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reproach from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou,</HI> my Lord, is not kind—but I do not desire you to let her please herself in chusing one she likes, only do not force her to take one she hates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she told you that she hates Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in express words; but the repugnance she shews—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps she loves some one else.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, my Lord, I believe she does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she has made you the confident of her tender passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I extorted something like a confession of this sort from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray who may be the happy man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young Branville, Sir Anthony's nephew, who is now on his travels, and is expected every day home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>A forward little gipsey—This is the curse of mar∣rying early, to have our children tugging at our purse-strings, at a time when we have as quick a relish for the joys of life as they have, and ten times a better capacity for pursuing them.—Look'ee, madam, I cannot give her a shilling; Sir Antho∣ny is ready to take her as she is; and if they should have a fa∣mily, is able to provide liberally for them all. On the con∣trary, if she follows her own soft inclinations, in marrying Mr. Branville, I suppose, in three or four years, I should have the pleasure of seeing myself a grand papa to two or three pretty little beggars, who, between their mother's vanity, and their father's poverty, may happen to continue so all their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, as Sir Anthony has sent his nephew a∣broad at his own expence, it looks as if he meant to do some∣thing handsome for him: besides, he is his uncle's heir in case he should die without children by marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you think you can keep him in a state of ce∣libacy, by refusing him your daughter—Oh fy, Lady Med∣way, I never heard you argue so weakly. Sir Anthony is not yet past the prime of life; besides, he has owned to me that it was his being discarded by Mrs. Knightly, which made him resolve, at once, in a sort of pique, to marry the first girl that fell in his way; birth and reputation being all the fortune he desired with her. A man thus circumstanced, is very little like∣ly to continue a batchelor—No, no, I'll take him in the hu∣mour, and secure him while I may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before it be too late, my Lord, let me once more be∣seech you to reflect on the misery of a married life, where on either side love or esteem is wanting. Have we not a glaring
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
instance of this in the house with us, in Sir Harry Flutter and his wife? are they not as wretched a pair as ever met in wed∣lock, perpetually quarrelling! I own, I almost repent my in∣vitation to them, and wish them fairly back again in the coun∣try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must not be. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> You have made a very unlucky choice in your example, ma'am; a foolish boy, and a giddy girl, that know not either of them what they would be at. He married the wife his mother chose for him, to get rid of his tutor; and she took the husband her wife father pro∣vided for her, to escape from a boarding school. What can be expected from two such simpletons? He, proud of the au∣thority of a husband, exercises it from the same principle, and with pretty much the same capacity, that children shew with regard to poor little animals that are in their power, in teaz∣ing and controlling them; and this he thinks makes him look manly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I imagine, for I have heard him say, he does no more than other husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>She, on the other hand, fancies the prerogatives of a wife consist in contradicting and opposing him; and this, I presume, she thinks is doing like other wives: but my life for it, when they know a little more of the world, they will be very happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never in each other, I am afraid, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, ma'am, let me ask you, what mighty feli∣city have you enjoyed, in being married to the man of your choice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a strange question, my Lord! I never com∣plained of my lot; but if I have not been completely happy, it is not owing to any fault of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be mine for ought I know—but I only mention it, to shew you that <HI>love</HI> is not such an almighty deity, as to confer happiness without certain ingredients besides, that I could name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, where it is reciprocal, there wants not much besides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be sure you preach that wise doctrine to your daugh∣ter; it will become your prudence, and no doubt will be ex∣tremely agreeable to her pretty romantic notions—But pr'ythee let us have done with the subject at once. One cir∣cumstance more, however, I shall acquaint you with; if the marriage between Medway and this lady should be accom∣plished, I have other purposes to appropriate her fortune to, than buying a husband for your daughter—But this is only in speculation—the thing may never happen—for nothing but the last extremity should compel me to urge my son against his inclination. In regard to Louisa, in two words, I <HI>will</HI> be obeyed: do me the favour to tell her as much. I shall see her presently, and expect such an answer from her, as her du∣ty shall dictate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, it is an unpleasing task you have assign'd me, but I will obey you.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Lady.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(looking after her.)</STAGE>
<P><HI>That</HI> you have always done, so much praise I will allow you—but I am out of humour with every thing. If this boy should dislike the match. I am un∣done at once—'Sdeath what a thing it is to have poverty star∣ing a man in the face, and no way to keep the horrid spectre from laying hold on you!—No way but one; it all depends on Medway's filial duty—A thousand vexations crowd up∣on me together—'Tis a pretty time for a man to think of in∣triguing! and yet the blooming beauty of that little madcap, with all her childishness about her, has caught such hold on me, that I must have her—Oh with what alacrity now could I pursue the chace, if my thoughts were a little more disen∣gaged!—She has been complaining to my wife of her hus∣band's ill usage of her; and he, I suppose, will come to me presently, to take a lesson, as he calls it, to enable him to use her worse—he shan't want my assistance—and here he comes to receive it.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> Harry Flutter.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my dear Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you seem out of breath, Sir Harry, what is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul, my Lord, I have been so stunn'd this morning, with the din of conjugal interrogatories, that I am quite bated—do, let me lounge a little on this couch of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, I suppose you were playing the rogue last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, only at the tavern. I was at home before three o'clock, and yet my wife was such an unreason∣able little devil, as to ask me forty questions about my stay∣ing out so late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's the way of them all—but I hope you are too well acquainted with your own prerogative, to give her any satisfaction on those accounts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Satisfaction! ho catch me at that, and gibbet me—no, no—But pray now, my Lord, how would you be∣have on such an occasion? for I should be very glad to find that my conduct squared with yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—not roughly—you know that is not my way—it is not manly; besides, it would at once provoke, and justify your wife in her resentment.—But there is a sort of sneering, ironical treatment, that I never knew fail of nettling a woman to the quick; and the best of it is, the thing won't <HI>bear</HI> repetition; for let <HI>them</HI> deliver your very words, without the tone and air accompanying them, and there shall not ap∣pear the least harm in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that, that's the secret I want to come at; that's the true art of tormenting, and what of all the talents your Lordship possesses, I envy you for the most—Heavens, how I have seen my Lady swell, and tears start into her eyes, when, devil take me if I thought you were not in perfect good humour all the while—Now, I am rather petulant, flash, flash, flash as quick as lightning, till I put my <HI>self</HI> into a confound∣ed passion, when I only meant to vex <HI>her—</HI>Tho' I think I was rather temperate too, this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was it, let's hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I came home at three o'clock, as I told you, a little tipsy too, by the by; but what was that to her,
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
you know, for I am always good humoured in my cups? To bed I crept, as softly as a mouse, for I had no more thought of quarrelling with her then, than I have now with your Lord∣ship—La, says she, with a great heavy sigh, it is a sad thing that one must be disturbed in this manner; and on she went, mutter, mutter, mutter, for a quarter of an hour; I all the while lying as quiet as a lamb, without making her a word of answer; at last, quite tired of her perpetual <HI>buzzing</HI> in my ear, Pr'ythee be quiet, Mrs. Wasp, says I, and let me sleep (I was not thoroughly awake when I spoke.) Do so, Mr. <HI>Drone,</HI> grumbled she, and gave a great flounce. I said no more, for in two minutes I was as fast as a top. Just now, when I came down to breakfast, she was seated at the tea∣table all alone, and looked so neat, and so cool, and so pret∣ty, that e'gad, not thinking of what had passed, I was going to give her a kiss; when up she toss'd her demore little face, You were a pretty fellow, last night, Sir Harry. says she: So I am every night, I hope, ma'am, says I, making her a low bow. Was not that something in your manner, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh very well, very well—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray where were you till that unconscionable hour, says she? At the tavern drinking, says I, very civilly. And who was with you, Sir? Oh, thought I, I'll match you for your enquiries; I nam'd your Lordship, and half a dozen more wild fellows, (whom, by the way, I had not so much as seen) and two or three girls of the town, added I, whistling, and looking another way—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was rather a little, though but a little, too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Down she slap'd her cup and saucer; If this be the case, Sir Harry, (half sobbing) I shall desire a separate bed. That's as <HI>I</HI> please, madam, sticking my hand in my side, and looking her full in the face. No, it shall be as <HI>I</HI> please, sir—it <HI>shan't,</HI> madam; it <HI>shall,</HI> sir; and it shan't, and it shall, and it shall, and it shan't, was bandied backwards and forwards till we were both out of breath with passion. At last she said something to provoke me, I don't know what it
<PB N="12" REF="110"/>
was, but I answered her a little tartly. You would not have said it, I believe—I'd give the world for your command of temper—but it slip'd out faith—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I said (for she vexed me cursedly) I said—faith I think I—as good as told her, she ly'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh sy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>She burst out a crying, I kick'd down the tea∣table, and away I scampered up to your Lordship, to receive advice and consolation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir Harry, I pity you; to be ty'd to such a little termagant is the devil; but 'tis the fortune of wedlock. One thing I have always observed; the more a husband submits, the more a wise tyrannizes. 'Twas my own case at first; but I was soon obliged to alter my course, and by exerting myself a little, I brought Lady Medway to be as well-behaved, I think, as any woman of quality in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she is upon my word, my Lord; I'd change with you with all my heart, if my Lady were a little younger. Duce take me but I wish we were like the Spartans; I assure you, if their laws were in force here, my wife should be at your service, and I dare say I should be as welcome to yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh undoubtedly, Sir Harry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>The women would like it vastly—your wife and mine I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I know mine doesn't care sixpence for me, and I suppose it may be pretty much the same with yours, and with all of them for that matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That doesn't follow—but how do you intend to act with regard to Lady Flutter? I suppose this little breach will be made up like all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by me, I assure you, my Lord; I don't in∣tend to speak to her to-day; and when I do, she shall ask my pardon before I forgive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Boh, that's children's play, fall out, and then pray, pray, kiss and be friends. No, Sir Harry, if you would shew
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
yourself a man, and a husband, let her see that you despise her little girlish petulance, by taking no farther notice of it. Now, were I in your case, I'd behave just as if nothing at all had happened. If she pouts, smile; and ask her how she likes your new sword-knot, or the point in your ruffles, or any o∣ther idle question. You know she must give you an answer. If it be a peevish one, laugh in her face, take up your hat, and wish her a good morning; if on the contrary, she speaks with good humour, seem not to hear her, but walk about the room, repeating verses. Then, as if you had not observed her before, Did you speak to me, Lady Flutter? but without wait∣ing for her reply, slide out of the room, humming a tune—Now all this, you see, were she to relate it, will not have the appearance of ill treatment; and yet my life for yours, it humbles her more than all the blustering airs you could put on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure you are right, my Lord. The case is plain; but the difficulty is in executing the thing properly, I am so warm in my temper. Oh what would I give for your glorious cool sneer of contempt!—I'll try for it positively; and e'gad I'll now go to her and make the experiment; and so, my Lord, adieu for the present, and thanks for this lesson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry! do you dine at home to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how that may be till I have re∣connoitred; your Lordship, I know, does not—and I hate to dine alone with the women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I shall certainly be at home soon after dinner; for I shall long to know on what terms you and my Lady may be by that time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh heaven knows—we may be at cuffs by that time, perhaps; but I shall be in the way.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Sir Harry.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he follows my advice, I think she must hate him heartily—and then I step in as her comforter—But I have other business to mind at present—so many projects on foot without a certainty of accomplishing one of them—Z—ns, if I had not the firmness of a Stoic, I should beat my own brains out.</P>

<P>My dear, it afflicts me as much as it does you; but you know your papa is absolute: I wish, therefore, you would endeavour to reconcile yourself to Sir Anthony.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, it is impossible! If my heart were ever so much at liberty, it never could endure that forbidding man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, child, you are too much governed by fancy;—tho' he is not quite in the bloom of youth, yet is hefar from being disagreeable. What is it you so much dislike in him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam! sure the pomp and strange turn of his phrases, and the solemnity of his manner, is almost ridicu∣lous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is rather formal, I allow you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then his notions of love so extravagant, his ad∣dress so romantic, nothing but flames and rapture in his mouth, and, according to my brother's account of him, he has no more real warmth than a marble statue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You find he lov'd Mrs. Knightly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>His peculiarities diverted her, madam, and she in∣dulged him in them—I am told he used to sigh at her feet for half a day, and if he committed the smallest fault, she would impose a penance on him, which Sir Anthony always receiv∣ed as a mark of favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, my dear, it is not more agreeable to you; for I am commissioned to tell you, positively, you <HI>must</HI> accept of him for a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, madam, he has never spoken a word to me on the subject—I have seen him but a few times, and—in short, I can't bear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I tell your papa what you say? he, no doubt, will be perfectly satisfied with this determination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam! sure you will not. Save me from my papa's anger, you know I dare not open my heart to him. You (except in your maternal tenderness) are more like a com∣panion
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
to me than a parent. The authority of the mother is melted down in the kindness of the friend; my papa's severity had else been insupportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Louisa, you are not to give so harsh a name to your father's sollicitude for your happiness. He is not to be shaken in his resolution. I have already exerted my utmost influence over him, and that I am sorry to say, is less, much less, than it ought to be.—Hist!—I hear your father's voice below; he is coming up to you. I beg, my dear, you will let him see by your obedience, that my interposition has had its proper ef∣fect. I'll give you the opportunity to talk to him alone.</P>

<P>I was going to my chamber, my Lord, if you had not forbid it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbid! fy, what an ungenteel word to use towards a heroine in romance! There are some surly fathers, indeed, who take those liberties with their children; but I, who know breeding better, only intreat; and therefore, ma'am, beg the favour of your company a little longer; if a mind dignified by the noble passion of love, can condescend to the admoniti∣ons of a parent—What does the fool hang her head for? Sit down there—What, you are going to faint, I hope—Oh I d—y—e! I <HI>ex-pire—</HI>Branville take my last adieu—Here, Betty, some hartshorn for the despairing nymph, quick∣ly—your lady is dying for love.—So, so, so, the sluice is let out at last.—</P>
<P>So lilies look surcharg'd with morning dew!</P>
<P>You really look very pretty when you cry, Louisa, I had a mind to see how it would become you.</P>

</SP>
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I beg your permission to withdraw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay where you are, madam.—When I condescend to talk with you, methinks you ought to know, 'tis your duty to attend to what I have to say. You know my mind already in regard to young Branville.—Ay, sigh on—fy, fy, do those glowing aspirations become a young lady educated as you have been? Your mother, I am sure, has always set you a good example. I was no pattern for you to follow.—But observe what I say; I forbid you to think, but even to think, of Branville. That is the first, and perhaps the hardest part of my command. The next is, that you resolve immediately to accept of Sir Anthony for your husband. And now, Miss, you may, if you please, retire to your chamber, and, in plain∣tive strains, either in verse or prose, bemoan your hard fate; and be sure you complain to your waiting-woman what a ty∣rant you have to your father.—Go, get you gone.</P>

<P>I met my sister in tears—I hope, my Lord, she has done nothing to disoblige you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh a mere trifle—only confessed a passion for a fellow not worth sixpence, but what depends on the caprice of a relation, and, like a prudent as well as dutiful child, has shewn a thorough dislike of her father's choice.</P>

<P>My Lord, she will consider better of it; I am sure my sister would willingly obey you in every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what purpose is a father's sollicitude for the wel∣fare of his children, if a perverse silly girl will counter-act all his projects?—You, Medway, have ever shewn yourself an

affectionate, as well as an obedient son, to a parent who con∣fesses himself, with regard to you, not one of the most provi∣dent—I wish I could make you amends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the tenderness you have always shewn me, deserved every return I could make you.—I wish for no o∣ther amends but to see you easy in your mind and in your cir∣cumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well said! but I expected as much from you. Suppose, now, that it were in your power to make me easy in both, and at the same time effectually to serve yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it were, my Lord, you should see my readiness to embrace the opportunity—But I am afraid there is no∣thing now in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you are mistaken, there are ways and means to retrieve all; and it was on this subject I wanted to talk with you—There is a certain lady of fortune, son—What! droop at the very mention of her? that's an ill omen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I doubt my fortune never <HI>can</HI> be mended by those means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! Suppose the widow Knightly, with a real estate of three thousand a year, and a personal one of fifty thousand pounds, should have taken a fancy to you, would not that be a means?—You blush; perhaps you are already acquainted with the lady's passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am glad to see you so pleasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am serious, I assure you—Why, is there any thing so extraordinary in a woman's falling in love with a handsome young fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, if the Lady has really done me that honour, 'tis more than I deserve; for I never made the least advances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but how do you like her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She is genteel, I think—I really never examined her features.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's strange! Why, you visit her sometimes I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go to her house, my Lord; but 'tis her younger si∣ster whom I visit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph—What sort of a damsel is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A most angelic creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! then it seems you <HI>have</HI> examined <HI>her</HI> features?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I have known her long. Miss Richly, who as well as her sister was born abroad, was sent hither some years since for her education, and I became acquainted with her in the house of a friend of mine with whom she lived. Mrs. Knightly, who had married an English merchant, was then settled at Lisbon, and knew but little of her sister, till lately; when, having lost her husband, she came to England, and took the young Lady under her own care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! I perceive you know their history.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my Lord. Poor Miss Richly's part of it is a me∣lancholy one; for her father was so partial to his eldest daugh∣ter, that he left her by much the greatest portion of his estate; and what the youngest had to her share, she had the misfor∣tune to lose, by the breaking of a merchant, in whose hands her money lay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are better informed than I am, I find—Well, but what do you think of Mrs. Knightly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think, my Lord! I really don't know what to think. The Lady is very deserving, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But! oh those damned <HI>Buts!</HI> Am I to be <HI>butted</HI> by you all, one after the other? There's your mother first, to be sure she is very ready to acquiesce in every thing that I approve, <HI>but</HI> she thinks it hard a young creature should have any force put on her inclinations, though it be for her own good—Then Miss Louisa—she is all obedience and submission<HI>—but,</HI> alas! <HI>she</HI> has given away her heart already—And you, <HI>you</HI> too are perfectly disposed to oblige me; <HI>but</HI> you will chuse for yourself, I presume, notwithstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you really distress me, by entertaining the least doubt of that reverence I ever have born towards you, and ever will bear; but, in a case like this (pardon me, my Lord,) I cannot at once give up all that I have now left, or can claim a right in the disposal of, my honour and my love—I own I love Miss Richly, have loved her long; and if virtue, beauty, and unaffected innocence, deserve a heart, my Lord,
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
she has a claim to mine, and is, I confess, entire mistress of it; yet I wish the evil (since it is one) had stopped there—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, she loves me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it—Oh son, son, a pretty face will not redeem our acres.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never till now lamented her want of fortune, which I knew indeed from the beginning; but still hoped that I might one day be in a condition to support her, as her own merit and my rank required. I even flattered myself that I should obtain your consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! to marry a beggar, Medway?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, my Lord, you will not use so harsh a word. She is worthy of higher, much higher dignity, than ever I could raise her to—What is a title, my Lord, stripped as I am of every thing besides?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reproach is ungenerous, Medway; but I have deserved it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, my Lord; I meant it not as such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you <HI>had,</HI> I could forgive it—but we will say no more on the subject. I will not urge you on so tender a point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Answer me but one question: Are you under a pro∣mise to marry Miss Richly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord, her generosity would not suffer her to let me bind myself by any other tie than that of inclination, as I insisted on <HI>her</HI> being free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well—Then I do not see how your <HI>honour</HI> is so much concerned; and as for your love, when I was of your age, Medway, I had so many <HI>loves,</HI> that it was hard to tell which of them had the best claim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you were so kind as to promise you would in∣sist no farther on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, well, I have done—I'll detain you no long∣er. Some business calls me out at present; I shall see you in the evening.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my Lord, <HI>I</HI> am nobody in Sir Harry's opinion; but indeed, at present, I should be but a very dull companion to any me; so I am sure your Lordship will ex∣cuse me if I take my leave.</P>

<P>Gone! on business, I think, of some kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Business! I don't know of any business that he has; I am sure it is some other engagement.</P>

<P>Oh—what am I thinking of? 'tis to the play.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>The play! he could not have been in such a hurry for that, 'tis too early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was to go with a party, and to call on some peo∣ple by the way; that was the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't much care; but I am sure that was not the thing neither; for I heard you say, it were well if he were going to half as good company, as that in which he left you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that I should certainly say, ma'am, let him be going to whom he would. But Sir Harry has a deprav'd taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt but he is going to some of his tavern-ladies. With all my heart; I don't love him well e∣nough to be jealous of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you did, for that would help on my work. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Why, indeed, my dear Lady Flutter, I can't say that Sir Harry is <HI>quite</HI> so deserving of you, as I could wish he were. But he is a mere boy, and can't be supposed to be so sensible of your merit, as those are, who have had a little more experience in the sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shan't be long with him, that's one comfort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear ma'am, consider how that will appear in the eyes of the world. Here you are but a little while mar∣ried, what must people think of a separation? Your good un∣derstanding is unquestioned, your personal accomplishments admired by all who know you; the blame then must all fall on poor Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so let it for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>He deserves it, I confess; but, ma'am, give me leave to reason with you a little now; for I know you are a woman of sense, and capable of reasoning. Don't you think a <HI>leetle</HI> stroke of censure may possibly glance on you, for not endea∣vouring to bear, for a while longer at least, with his indiscre∣tion; for every body knows that your prudence is much su∣perior to his, and therefore more will be expected from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you compliment now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my life I don't. I am sure I have said it a thousand times, that I don't know a woman of fashion in town (a handsome one I mean, you are to take that into the account too) with half your talents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word I am serious; and, between ourselves, Sir Harry is thought to be but of very moderate parts, and that it was almost a sacrifice to marry you to him- But I would not say this for the world to any one but you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="270"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very good of you, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discretion, I am sure, will make a proper use of the hint. There are great allowances to be made for a raw young fellow, who, like some vain and ignorant virtuoso, is possessed of a rarity, of which he neither understands the na∣ture, nor knows the value. Oh, Lady Flutter, a beautiful and accomplished woman is a gem fit only for the cabinet of a man of sense and taste.</P>

<P>Indeed you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is nothing to the purpose—What would you advise me to do with this foolish boy; for I would not have my discretion called in question neither? I am sure if he had but the sense to talk to me as you have done, he might do just what he pleased with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amiable creature!—Well, whatever you do, don't think of parting from him, for that would only be making mirth for all the spiteful old maids in town; who have already prophesied, that miss and master would quarrel before a month was at an end, and each run home crying to their seve∣ral mama's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do the malicious creatures say so! Well, I'll disappoint them in that—But what can I do, my Lord, he is so intolerably conceited and pert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh don't mind him, and it will wear off by degrees! But, my dear Lady Flutter, are there not other pleasures with

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me; I apprehen ded you had uttered some∣thing. Well, my Lord, I am next to enquire (though, to say the truth, I ought, in point of good breeding, to have done it first;) I am next, I say, to enquire how your excellent Lady does, and the fair young Lady your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both at your service, Sir Anthony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I presume to ask the christian name of the <HI>young</HI> Lady.</P>
</SP>

<P>I would not have Lady Medway hear you make so <HI>emphatical</HI> a distinction, Sir Anthony; ladies you know are always young—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a privilege I know they claim, my Lord, and I hope you don't think me capable of such barbarism as to dis∣pute it with them; but at the same time I imagine 'tis not possible in nature, but that the mother must be rather older than her daughter—You'll excuse my pleasantry</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh surely, as the ladies are n't by—But why do you enquire my daughter's name, Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Lord, there is <HI>a</HI> pretty familiar tender∣ness in sometimes using the christian name, that is truly de∣lightful to a lover; for such, my Lord, with all due deference to the Lady's high deserts, I wish myself to be considered.</P>

<P>Wou'dn't you have had it so, Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the profound respect I have for your Lordship makes me unwilling to animadvert on such proceed∣ings, as you in your wisdom (which I take to be very great) have thought expedient; but I am a man, my Lord, who love method.</P>

<P>Sir Anthony, I imagined it would have been agree∣able to you, or it should have been very far—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conceive me right, Lord Medway; 'tis perfectly agreeable to me, and consonant to my wishes, to be looked on with a favourable eye by the virtuous young Lady your daugh∣ter; but, my Lord, to tell you sincerely (and sincerity, my Lord, I hold to be a virtue) my heart is at present in a fluctuat∣ing state.</P>

<P>I am sorry then, Sir, that the thing has been menti∣oned at all. I understood you were determined. (What can the blockhead mean?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good my Lord, your patience: I <HI>am</HI> determined; that is to say, my <HI>will</HI> is determined; but the will and the heart, your Lordship knows, are two different things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Anthony, I should be glad we understood each o∣ther at once. I apprehended Mrs. Knightly's ill usage of you had made you give up all thoughts of her; and as you seem∣ed determined to marry, and declared yourself an admirer of my daughter, who I must say (the article of fortune excepted) is, I think, as unobjectionable a wife as you could chuse—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, my Lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was willing to give my consent, and thought you appeared as ready to embrace it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my Lord; and so I do still, most cordially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, what is your determination? For a young woman of family and reputation must not be trifled with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I believe <HI>trifling</HI> is a fault which was never yet attributed to Sir Anthony Branville—My Lord, I am above the imputation—and your Lordship would do well to remember that I have the misfortune to be of a warm, not to say of an impetuous disposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I don't mean to provoke your wrath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the father of my mistress, my Lord—that thought restrains my fury—But this woman (Mrs. Knightly I mean, for a <HI>woman</HI> I find she is, though I once thought her an angel;) she, I say, has not yet dismissed me in
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
form; and till that is done, I think myself bound in honour, not to make a tender of my heart, or hand, to any Lady what∣soever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir Anthony, I find you have still a hankering af∣ter the widow, and only want an opportunity to endeavour at getting into her good graces again—You would fain see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my Lord; not for the world! for, as I told your Lordship, I would not trust my heart with such an interview—No, no, I know the witchcraft of her beauty too well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean to disengage yourself then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My design is to indite an epistle to her, and to request that she will under her hand, in full and explicit terms, give me an absolute and final release from all the vows I have made her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh dear, my Lord! too soon by <STAGE>[looking at her watch]</STAGE> an age—I am such an impatient creature, I can't endure to wait a minute for any thing, and therefore never go to any public entertainment till after it begins.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then don't begin at all, Sir Anthony; for I think you are generally more at a loss how to make an end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="350"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I must beg the favour of being allowed a hearing; a patient one, Madam; for such the nature of my case requires.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it a physical one, or a case of conscience, Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither, Madam. I did propose to unfold my mind to you in a letter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then if I should not unfold your letter, Sir Anthony, which is a thing <HI>might</HI> happen, in that case I should never know your mind, you know.</P>

<P>If you won't hear me, Madam—</P>

<SP>

<P>Well, well, I will hear you; but squeeze what you have to say into as small a compass as you can, my dear Sir Anthony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The occasion, Madam, of my giving you this trouble (if as such you are pleased to consider it) is as follows. I have courted you, Madam, that is, made honourable addres∣ses to you, for the space of six months, during which time you gave me all the encouragement—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Encouragement! <STAGE>[screams]</STAGE> Oh, all you powers of chastity defend me!—Encouragement, Sir An∣thony! Of what nature, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your pardon, Madam—Consistently with mode∣sty I mean; or such as became a virtuous Lady to bestow on a passionate admirer; for such I pronounce myself to have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh I understand you now—Well, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a time I was favoured with your smiles, and had reason to believe that my faithful passion would have been crowned with success; when all of a sudden, to my unuttera∣ble astonishment, the sun-shine of my hopes vanished.</P>

<P>I only stepp'd behind a cloud, Sir Anthony, to play at bo-peep with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, a total eclipse, I do assure you.—My visits were repulsed, my letters unanswered, and fi∣nally your doors shut against me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I do all this to poor Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did, Madam—Tyrant, you know you did.
<PB N="37" REF="360"/>
And now, Madam, I would fain learn your reasons for such usage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reasons—I never gave a reason for any thing I did since I was born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is rather extraordinary, Madam; but if you will not condescend to give me any reasons for your cru∣elty, all I have left to desire, or rather to demand, (pardon me the expression, Madam) is now, from your own lips, to receive my final doom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I shan't marry these ten years, Sir Anthony.</P>
</SP>

<P>That, Madam, is an indeterminate answer. I humbly request the favour of a final one</P>

<P>Madam, let me most humbly beseech you—</P>

<P>Begone, dissembler—but what could I ex∣pect from such <HI>levity</HI> as yours—</P>

<P>I protest, my dear, your uncle is so very a∣morous, that it is not safe to stay alone with him.</P>

<P>Madam, madam, I blush for you; humbly ask∣ing your pardon for being so free as to say so.</P>

<P>My uncle's behaviour, madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I hope my niece Flutter has too good an opinion of the propriety of my conduct upon all occasions, to be prejudiced by your uncharitable insinuations. And now, madam, I demand, in presence of my niece aforesaid, that you will give me a full and formal acquital of all my vows and pro∣mises to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must take time to consider on that, Sir Anthony; vows are serious things; I suppose all yours are registered in Cupid's books.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I insist on my release, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether it be safe to give you one, Sir Anthony; I must consult a lawyer first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am sorry to say, that you depart ex∣tremely from that punctilious honour, as well as generosity of sentiment, which is such an ornament to the fair part of the creation—only ask for the favour of being discharged—a fa∣vour I was never refused by any lady before, I assure you, niece.</P>

<P>And I return you my very unfeign∣ed acknowledgments for ridding me of your most insipid solem∣nity, my dear Sir Anthony. Ha, ha, ha, poor soul! to whom is he going to offer his Platonic adorations, do you know, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, by what I gather'd just now from the conversation between my Lord and him (for it was a secret to me before) I find Miss Medway is likely to supplant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Supplant me, my dear creature! why, sure you can't suppose I had ever any serious thoughts of the poor man; humbly begging your pardon, as he says, for taking such a liberty with your uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should wonder if you had, I own; I am sure nothing but his fortune could have made my Lord think of him for a son-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does Miss Medway approve of the thing? she is a sober sort of a girl, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh intolerably so; I hardly ever converse with her, tho' under the same roof. She is for ever poring o∣ver a book or a needle—Yet I don't suppose she likes him either; I have heard it whispered that she loves my cousin Branville, who, I hear, is expected home every hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought so, I would keep Sir
<PB N="40" REF="390"/>
Anthony dangling this twelvemonth, out of mere compassion to the poor girl. For, notwithstanding his threats, I know he is still devoted to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how would that square with your views in regard to Colonel Medway?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my sweet friend, that question has made me serious all at once. I can laugh at Sir Anthony no more; I have not lately had spirits enough to be diverted with him, and for that reason, tried to shake him off. I don't know what to think of the Colonel. I came here this evening on purpose to consult you. My Lord, who, I perceive, is a man of the world, and full of design, dropped some hints to me about his son, by which I find the thing would at least be very agreeable to <HI>him;</HI> yet the Colonel has not been near me since. I wish I knew his sentiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I can't inform you. There is none of the family very communicative, but my Lord; he is the best of them, that is certain.</P>

I am amaz∣ed to find <HI>you</HI> here; I thought you had <HI>abandoned</HI> me, as Mrs. Knightly says, and that by this time you had taken post for Oxfordshire, in order to tell papa, that Sir Harry was such a naughty boy, he would not give it its way in every thing. Mrs. Knightly, when I went out this evening, she was going to e∣lope, absolutely bent upon running away from her husband.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you see, ma'am, the return he makes

<P>Then let me be your tutor, to teach you a science, in which Sir Harry is not worthy to instruct you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Lord, if I had met with you before I was married, and before <HI>you</HI> were married—But it is too late now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not say so. What are marriage ties, if the hearts are not joined? 'Tis that alone which makes the union sacred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the chief thing, I grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh it is all in all!—With regard to Lady Med∣way
<PB N="44" REF="430"/>
now; she is a good woman, it is true, and I esteem her as such; but there is no love in the case, so that I consider myself absolutely as a single man. 'Tis just the same with you; there has a ceremony indeed passed between you and Sir Harry; but he slights you, and you very justly despise him: so that, to all intents and purposes, you are a single woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I were, I'm sure, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so you are, my dear ma'am, if you would con∣sider the thing rightly—If I thought otherwise, tho' I con∣fess I love you to adoration, I would sooner stab myself to the heart, than endeavour to win your affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, I believe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, since we are equally unhappy in wedlock, what crime can there be in our mutual endeavours to console each other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I don't intend any harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why will you talk of leaving me? You know Sir Harry is too indifferent to be concerned at a separation; the grief, the disappointment, will all be mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, I should be very unwilling to make you uneasy, to whom I owe so many obligations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then speak no more of parting. <STAGE>[He takes her hand.]</STAGE> I have a thousand things to tell you. The delightful subject we are upon is inexhaustible, but I can never get you for half an hour to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no, Sir Harry is so perpetually whif∣fling backwards and forwards, one can't be alone a minute for him.</P>
<STAGE>[Lady Medway comes to the door, and steps back on seeing Lord Medway and Lady Flutter in such familiar confer∣ence.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have thought of an expedient, which, if you will agree to, will secure us against all interruptions for the fu∣ture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know Lady Lovegrove, who sat in the box
<PB N="45" REF="440"/>
with us at the play the other night (a very worthy woman.) I am sure she would be glad of your acquaintance. I'll intro∣duce you to her, and there, you know, when you go of an e∣vening to drink tea, I can meet you, and we can enjoy an hour's conversation without being interrupted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest that will do very well. But we must not let Sir Harry know a word of my acquaintance with her, or may be, some evening, he'll be for thrusting himself in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOrd.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, he shall never be of our party. Come, ma'am, I fancy, by this time, the ladies have done with their sober studies—Suppose we were to join them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you will, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a word more of parting, remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Would not have mentioned it at all, if I thought you could have suffered it to make so serious an im∣pression on you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ought not, I confess, knowing as I do the truth and generosity of your heart—and yet I cannot help
<PB N="46" REF="450"/>
being alarmed—an immense fortune, and a fine woman, as my sister really is—the temptation is so great! that were it any one but you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Clara, these fears of yours reproach, at the same time that they flatter me. Is it necessary that I should tell you, over and over again, for the thousandth time, that I never can love any woman but yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not want to be convinced—and yet I own I am pleased to hear you repeat even what you <HI>have</HI> said a thousand times; but your father's authority—I dread that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, you have no reason; for, though no son was ever more observant of a father's will than I have always been of his; yet, in the particular concerns of my heart, I must be my own director. This my father knows, and I hope he will never urge me more upon the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he should?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you have me swear to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, not for the world!—I am ashamed of doubting, and yet I don't know how it is, I am full of appre∣hensions: the truth is, I am not very happy at home; my sis∣ter is, of late, grown cold and peevish to me—I never sus∣pected the cause before, but 'tis now too plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she ever mention me to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never but in a careless way—and yet I think since your father's last visit to her, she has been in better spirits than before, though I am not used one bit the kinder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall not long be subject to her tyranny. My fa∣ther already knows the secret of my love; and I think that, notwithstanding the article of fortune weighs much with him, his regard to my happiness will even out balance that.</P>

<P>I hope <HI>my</HI> being here, ma'am, will not deprive Miss Richly of the pleasure of your company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, sister, we shall both think our con∣versation very much improved by your making a third in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that—A tete a tete is to the full as often disagreeably inter <HI>rupted,</HI> as improved by another person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, madam, I am sure, can never happen, <HI>where</HI> you make the addition</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry it were the case now, I own, Colonel; for, to tell you the truth, I have vanity enough to be mortified at the thoughts of being considered as an in∣truder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, madam! I know of but one circumstance in the world, which could possibly place you in such a light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, pray sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where an inferior beauty was meditating a conquest, and you stept in to snatch it from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>An inferior beauty—I protest, Colonel, I don't well understand that—There is an appearance of gal∣lantry in the compliment, and yet there is something a little mystical in it too. Clara, are you good at solving riddles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, sister; you know I have a very lite∣ral understanding; besides, I think what the Colonel says re∣quires no explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my dear, I won't affront you by making any application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you should, sister, I am very ready to ac∣knowledge my part in it; but you should consider, that by the remainder, you would draw on yourself that imputation, which but now you wished to avoid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Colonel, the mysterious speech you have made has the fate of all oracles, to be interpreted diffe∣rent ways, and perhaps none of them right—Nay, I am in∣clined to think it bears a still nearer resemblance to them, and that you, like the priests of old, delivered what you said with∣out any inspiration of a god.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="470"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, madam, your comparison fails, for I assure you I am at this instant under the influence of a very powerful one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow I don't believe you; do you, Clara?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never had any reason to doubt the Colonel's veracity, sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, you think he is really in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you hear him acknowledge it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, madam, if you wo'nt take <HI>my</HI> word for it, I can't see what reason you have to believe any one's else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no, that's true—But where a matter of faith does'nt concern one's self, infidelity, you know, can be of no great consequence one way or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pretty home.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, sister; but scepticism is a danger∣ous, as well as an uneasy state, in <HI>some</HI> cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a state of <HI>security,</HI> Miss Clara, the casuists in <HI>love,</HI> as well as religion, are agreed, is not always the safest. But I don't know how we fell upon this odd topic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, I am sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how we came to talk of it; but I am convinced the man must be very insensible who could avoid thinking of it in this company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clara, you are a monopolist; but I will have my share in that compliment—I don't know, Colo∣nel tho', what your mistress would say if she were to hear you say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>She'd forgive him, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, ladies, I see by your pursuing this sub∣ject, that you have a design of getting my secret out of me; and, as I am sure I could not withstand your united force, I think my safest way is to make my retreat before I betray my∣self—</P>
<STAGE>[Bows to both, and exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long was the Colonel here before I came in, Clara?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not above a quarter of an hour—Pray, sister, why do you ask?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it is quite astonishing to me, how
<PB N="49" REF="480"/>
a man of his vivacity can be entertained by such a piece of still-life as you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sister, it is not an in<HI>-falli-</HI>ble maxim, that we most admire those who are exactly of our own dispo∣sition. I, now, for example, who am naturally grave, do, notwithstanding, admire sprightliness in other people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph, so it seems—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Colonel, tho' extremely lively him∣self, may, however, not disrelish the conversation of a serious woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Clara, you are a very conceited girl. I dare swear, if the Colonel says fine things to you, you believe every word of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, sister, I have as humble an opinion of myself, as you, or any one else can possibly have of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear it, child; for I own I think vanity would not be a very desirable companion in your situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have I done, sister, to deserve these severe taunts from you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Clara, if you accuse me of severity, I must tell you that you are an ungrateful girl, and I fancy we shall not continue much longer together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not quite so destitute, madam, but that I can still be received by that friend who had the care of me from my childhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, madam, I shall consider of it; but perhaps I may find out some more eligible place for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, sister, you are resolved to disapprove of every thing I say or do; my company is become irksome to you, and, for the present at least, I'll rid you of it—</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very unlucky in ever taking her into my house; had it not been for that, I should never, perhaps, have seen the only man who probably could have given me a minute's uneasiness.—I am puzzled at his conduct—and yet I suspect now more than ever that they love each other—If it be so, I shall know it too soon, for I am sure Lord Med∣way

<P>I was afraid you were not well, Lady Flutter, as you lay abed so long this morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rested ill last night, nothing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I don't interrupt you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least; but I vow you are so ce∣remonious, Lady Medway, that you will not allow me to think myself at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry for that, madam; but you know there are times when one would not chuse to be broke in upon by any one; yet, to shew you how free I make with you, I have brought my work with me, if you will let me pore a lit∣tle at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish she and her work were far enough. <STAGE>(A∣side.)</STAGE> Your Ladyship is excessively obliging. You and Miss Medway are such housewives, you quite shame me—This is prodigiously pretty; who are these ruffles for?</P>
</SP>

<P>My Lord, to be sure—Where is Sir Harry this morning? I have not seen him yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="500"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Lady Medway, don't ask me about him, for I know nothing of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, not of your husband, my dear! Well, well, Lady Flutter, when your young necks are a little more inured to the marriage yoke, I hope it will sit easier on you both—This work blinds me, I'll lay it by—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh impossible! he grows worse and worse every day. There never was such an incorrigible ill-natured thing in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, really, there I must differ from you; I never took Sir Harry to be ill-natured; hasty and petulant, I grant you, he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I hope you will allow me to be the best judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have reason to be so, I own; but a stander-by may form an opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what your <HI>Lady-</HI>ship's opinion may be; but I am sure it is the opinion of others, and some that I could name of undoubted good judgment, that there never <HI>was,</HI> since the creation, a woman so unfortunate in a husband as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Lord Medway, what have you to answer for! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> I must say, Lady Flutter, that if it even <HI>were</HI> so (which, heaven knows, is far from being the case), they are not <HI>your</HI> friends, no more than Sir Harry's, who would en∣deavour to persuade you to such a belief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, ma'am! Why, isn't it visible to all the world? Doesn't all the town ring of his ridiculous beha∣viour, and wonder at my patience in bearing it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Lady Flutter, I believe you are mistaken. The town have something else to mind beside little domestic quarrels that no way concern them; and I dare say, no-body but your particular friends trouble their heads about it. Tho', I must observe, that had both you and Sir Harry been a little less communicative, even to some of your <HI>friends,</HI> on the sub∣ject of your disagreement, it might have been happier for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear ma'am! I know there are some tame wives in the world, who can submit in silence to any
<PB N="52" REF="510"/>
usage; but I am not one of those, I assure you. I have not been used to controll, nor I won't be controll'd, that's more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, dear Lady Flutter, I don't mean to offend you; I would argue with you as a friend. Pray speak low∣er; I would not have any of our servants hear on what sub∣ject we are discoursing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gracious! why, every servant in the house knows how we live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, madam, don't you think your unguarded complaints without doors, and perhaps your unadvised choice of confidants within, may lead you into some inconvenience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't well understand your question, Lady Medway; my choice of confidants within—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—male ones, I mean; for example now, if a young married lady should make choice of a gentleman to whom she should open her heart, and let him so far into her confidence as to tell him she despises her husband, what do you think must be the consequence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! why, I suppose he'd think—he'd imagine—I don't know what he'd think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you; he'd think, perhaps, that a liking to <HI>him</HI> had as great a share in the lady's contempt for her hus∣band, as any real fault of the husband's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he thought so, I could not help it; but I am sure there is no one to whom I complain will draw any such inference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing but what is very natural in all this, Lady Flutter; and the gentleman, on this supposition, will think himself bound to make an offer of his love to the lady; she, perhaps, receives it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, ma'am! these are strange conclu∣sions—What can she mean?</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destruction! madam, I could not have expec∣ed this from you, in your own house. I believe my Lord would not thank you for treating me thus—but if you are tired of me, madam—</P>

<P>Oh, my dear madam! you are in a very great error, my Lord is the greatest enemy you have in the world.</P>

<P>His <HI>designs</HI> on <HI>me!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam, his cruel, his (I grieve to say) infamous designs on you. Oh, Lady Flutter, you stand on a dreadful precipice! do not reject the kind hand that would snatch you from certain ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is such extraordinary language, Lady Medway, that really—I don't know what to say to it—I little imagined I should have created any jealousy when I came into your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you entirely mistake my motive. I own there was a time when I might have been influenced by jealousy, but I have out-lived it; and am not now actuated by so selfish a passion. Pity to your inexperienced youth, friend∣ship to your worthy parents, regard to the honour of your hus∣band, joined to the tenderness and duty I owe my Lord, are the sole motives which urge me to save you all, if possible, from ruin. I know my Lord makes love to you; and that you have, unwarily, been drawn in to make an assignation with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he has been so treacherous as to tell this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has not, I assure you; yet I am certain of the fact; I know too well the nature of his connections with Lady Love∣grove—And now, my dear, if you would escape the snare
<PB N="54" REF="530"/>
which is laid for your undoing, be advised by me, who am your true friend.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think I have a friend in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken; I am sincerely so. My Lord is a man of pleasure, and is perhaps less scrupulous in affairs of gallantry, than in any other vice. Your youth and agreeable person were alone sufficient to attract him; but when superad∣ded to this, he found you despised your husband, and made no difficulty of owning it to him, it almost amounted to an in∣vitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>An invitation, Lady Medway! you use me very ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a man of his cast, madam, it certainly does. Your unacquaintedness with men of intrigue makes you blind to your own danger; but indeed, Lady Flutter, there is but one step between you and inevitable shame and misery. What do you think must be the consequence, if Sir Harry should dis∣cover that you have appointed a private place of meeting with my Lord? What must he think of the nature of a correspon∣dence thus meanly carried on by stealth? Ask your own heart if you can justify this to your husband and to your friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord bless me, Lady Medway!—you terri∣fy me—I am amazed how you came to the knowledge of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a happiness to you, madam, that I have, if by it I can be the means of saving you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I was a fool for consenting; but sure, madam, you won't be so barbarons as to tell Sir Harry; it would give him such an advantage over me, I can't bear the thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, my dear, I should be sorry to be under the necessity of taking so disagreeable a step; and if I thought I could rely on your honour and discretion, in your future con∣duct, I certainly should keep your secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I'll quit your house directly, if that will satisfy you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, madam; how would you answer that to your friends, if they should enquire the reason? Here you
<PB N="55" REF="540"/>
came to town to stay the winter with me, and before a month's elapsed you quit my house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can tell them that Sir Harry is so in∣sufferable, I can't live with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will be ruled by me, Lady Flutter, for one week, nay but for three days, I'll engage that Sir Harry and you shall be as happy a couple as any in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh gracious! you could as soon convert us into angels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will you promise to be guided by me, but for a little while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear Lady Medway, I know you would recommend patience and submission, and all that; but I ne∣ver can, nor ever will submit to his humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, madam, I shall think it my duty to write to your father immediately, and let him know the danger of your situation; for though I am sure the parting you from your husband would afflict him, yet 'tis better he should receive you while you are innocent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you would have me do, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your task is not hard, if you are disposed to set a∣bout it. You are married to a very young man, Lady Flutter; who, though he is warm and volatile, does not want sense, and I am sure is good-natured in the main.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Lady Medway—you are enough to turn one's brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, madam. You, on the other hand, who have as much sense, and as much good-nature as he, are at the same time a little too quick and impatient of contradiction. He I will allow is too ready to <HI>give</HI> offence; but you in your turn must grant, that you are as sudden in <HI>taking</HI> it. Now, my dear, 'tis in your power, and give me leave to tell you, 'tis your duty also, to correct yours. And I'll answer for it that Sir Harry will follow your lead; for I am sure that he loves you a great deal better than my Lord does, let him tell you what he pleases.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, madam, to show you that it is not <HI>my</HI> fault that we live so uneasily, I will do as you would have me; you yourself shall be the judge; but then remember you are not to write to my papa.</P>

<P>But, Sir Harry, why should you doubt that Lady Flutter is serious?</P>

<P>Why really, ma'am, because I never knew Lady Flutter serious in any thing, but her endeavours to make herself disagreeable to me.</P>

<P>In which I sancy however she has not succeeded, Sir Harry.</P>

in the magic circle of Mrs. Knightly's charms; I wish you joy of your escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I humbly thank you; 'tis a felicity to me I acknowledge; for, my Lord, there never was such a Syren, such a Circe! Scylla and Charybdis (of whom we read in sable) were harmless innocents to her; but, Heaven be prais∣ed, I am my own man again; and now, my Lord, I am come, agreeably to the intimation I gave you before, to make a most respectful offering of my heart, to the truly deserving and fair Lady, Louisa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Anthony, I have already told you I shall be proud of your alliance, and my daughter I make no doubt is sensible of your worth!—Therefore, Sir Anthony, the shorter we make the wooing—women are slippery things—you un∣derstand me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship's insinuation, though derogatory to the honour of the fair-sex, (which I very greatly reverence) has, I am apprehensive a little too much veracity in it. <HI>I</HI> have found it so to my cost; for would you believe it, my Lord, this cruel woman, (Mrs. Knightly, I mean, begging her pardon for the epithet) is the eighth lady to whom I have made sincere, humble, and passionate love, within the space of these last thirteen years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me, Sir Anthony; is it possible that a gentleman of your figure and accomplishments could be re∣jected by so many?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not positively affirm, my Lord, that I was re∣jected by them <HI>all;</HI> no, my Lord, that would have been a se∣verity not to be survived—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was it then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blemishes, my Lord, foibles, imperfections in the fair ones, which obliged me (though reluctantly) to withdraw my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ho ho, why then the fault was your's, Sir Anthony, not theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny that, my Lord; with due submission to your better judgment, it was their fault, for the truth is, I
<PB N="62" REF="610"/>
never could get any of them to be serious. There is a levity, my Lord, a kind of (if I may so call it) instability, which runs through the gentler sex (whom nevertheless I admire) which I assure you has thus long deterred me from wedlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir Anthony, I find you have been peculiarly unfortunate in the ladies whom you have addressed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Supremely so, my Lord; for notwithstanding that they all received my devoirs most indulgently, yet I do not know how it was, in the long run they either absolutely refus∣ed making me happy, or else were so extremely unguarded in their conduct, even before my face, that I thought I could not, consistency with honour, confer the title of Lady Branville on any one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lot has been a little hard I must confess. I hope however <HI>that</HI> honour has been reserved by fate for my daugh∣ter. She is your ninth mistress, Sir Anthony, and that you know is a propitious number.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I take the liberty of hoping so too; and that she is destined to recompence me, for the disappointments and indignities I have received, from the rest of woman-kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir Anthony, I suppose I may now pre∣sent you to her in the character of a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I pant for that happiness.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fact upon my veracity; I hope your Lordship don't think me vain: and as she had indulged me such lengths,

could I be censured for raising my wishes to the possession of this beauty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir Anthony; but then her ill behavi∣our to you—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Lord, it has blotted, and as I may say totally erased her image from my breast—</P>

<PB N="64" REF="630"/>
if I were capable at the first onset (notwithstanding what passes here) of urging a lady on so nice a point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir; but I could expect no less from a gentleman whom all the world allows to be the very pat∣tern of decorum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a character, madam, that I have always been ambitious of supporting, whatever struggles it may cost me from my natural fervor; for let me tell you, madam, a beau∣tiful object is a dangerous enemy to decorum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your great prudence, Sir Anthony, leaves me no room to suspect—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to call it to my aid I do assure you, madam; for spite of the suggestions of passion, I by no means approve of those rash and impetuous lovers, who, without regard to the delicacy of the lady, would, (having obtained consent) as it were rush at once into her arms, you'll pardon me, madam, for so grossly expressing my idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir Anthony, I am charmed with your notions, so refined! so generous! and I must add (though it may ap∣pear vain) so correspondent with my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am transported to hear you say so! I am at this minute in an absolute extacy! Will you permit me, dear madam, the ravishing satisfaction of throwing my∣self at your feet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir Anthony; I could not bear to see a gentleman of your dignity in so humble a posture; I will suppose it done if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prostrate myself in imagination, I assure you madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir Anthony, as you see my papa is impati∣ent for the honour of being related to you, and that I am bound to an implicit obedience, I am afraid, unless your pru∣dence interposes, that we shall both be hurried into wedlock, with a precipitancy very inconsistent with pro priety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare, madam, I am of your ladyship's opinion, and am almost apprehensive of the same thing—</P>

<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is this to be avoided, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assured, madam, I too well know what is due to virgin modesty, to proceed with that rapidity, which my Lord (with whom I have not the honour of agreeing in this particular) seemeth to recommend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very kind, Sir Anthony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, madam, I should pay but an ill compliment to your transcending merit, if I did not think it worth sighing for a considerable time longer, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very noble in you, Sir Anthony—So passionate! and yet so nice—if all lovers were but like you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world I will presume to say would be the better, madam—but then I hope your rigours will not extend too far, my dear lady—a few months or so—longer than that I should be very near tempted to call cruel, I can tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As my passionate lover seems so well disposed to wait, I may chance to escape him. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Your extraor∣dinary merit, Sir Anthony, will undoubtedly shorten your time of probation—Mean while as I hinted to you before, that my papa is rather in haste to call you son, I would not have him imagine that <HI>I</HI> give any delay to this union. He may call my duty in question, which he expects should keep pace with his own wishes—you apprehend me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, my dear madam, and if I presume to interpret what you have so charmingly insinuated to my apprehension, you would have me just hint to my Lord, that you are not <HI>quite</HI> averse to honouring me with your fair hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am <HI>ready</HI> to do so, if you please, Sir An∣thony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good, but at the same time I shall give him to understand that I am not as yet intitled to receive that very great happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To that purpose, Sir, for I would not have this necessary delay appear to be of <HI>my</HI> chusing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You little know, madam, the violence I do my∣self to repress the ardor of my flames; but patience is a prime virtue in a lover, and Scipio himself never practised self-de∣denial with more success than I have done.</P>

<P>THERE's nothing good or ill but by comparison—Confound your dry maxims, what are they good for? <STAGE>(He throws away the book.)</STAGE> Yet there is some truth in <HI>that</HI> too.—Yesterday I thought myself an unhappy man—but what am I this morning? <HI>So</HI> much worse, that when I compare the two conditions, I <HI>now</HI> think I was <HI>happy</HI> yesterday.—My affairs are in a hopeful condition truly! Ruined in my fortune, jilted by my mistress, disobeyed by my son, in∣sulted by my wife's superior worth; and last night (thanks to my dear indulgent stars!) to sum up all, I was forced to pawn the only stake I had left, my honour; which when I shall re∣deem, heaven knows.<HI>—All</HI> is now lost; and if my son con∣tinues obstinately to refuse this match, I am irretrievably un∣done—What can these chits want?</P>

<P>Sarcastical gipsey! but come, we won't ban∣ter his Lordship about it; he meant us well, I believe, though he was a little out in his politics—for faith, my Lord, I think she is much the better since I have given her her own way.</P>

<P>I am glad of it, Sir.—Have you any thing father to offer?</P>

<P>Nothing, but our good advice, my Lord; as we have received so much from you, I think we owe you some in return; and, I am sure, if you would take <HI>mine,</HI> you would not think of my uncle for a son-in-law.</P>

<P>My Lord, you know you may command me; I am

ready to hazard my life for your service, if it be any thing of that nature.</P>

<P>No, no, no; I am not so old, Medway, as to require the assistance of your sword.—You mistake my meaning quite.</P>

<P>Dear, my Lord, don't think of me in the case.</P>
</SP>

<P>Last night, George, I lost two thousand pounds, which I was obliged to pay this morning, and my honour is engaged for almost as much more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I thought you had determined never to ven∣ture on such deep play again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had so; but something happened yesterday that vexed and disconcerted me, and I went to the old set, just to amuse myself for an hour; but I don't know how it was—they drew me in for half the night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am exceedingly concerned; but what can <HI>I</HI> do now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there's the point—I am very loth to revive a subject, that I know is disagreeable to you; but you see to what distress I am driven—there is but one way left.—You remember what we talked of yesterday; if my curst ill fortune had not pursued me last night, I thought never to have mentioned it to you again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I flattered myself you never would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I should not have occasion. I had another thing in view; but this last blow has crushed all my hopes at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not practicable, my Lord, to devise some other way?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh impossible! I am overwhelmed with debts, and worried like a stag at bay; but with regard to this last, for which my honour's pawned, I must be speedy in the means of payment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, I am exceedingly shock'd at what you tell me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that all I am to expect from you? Look ye, Medway, it does not become a father to <HI>entreat</HI> a son; neither is it suitable to your age, or the character you bear in life, to be threatened, like a sniv'ling girl, with parental authority; <HI>mine</HI> is impotent, for I have nothing left to bestow; but as you would wish to prosper hereafter, save your father from dis∣grace, your mother (a good one she has been to you) from pe∣nury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I call Heaven to witness I would give up my <HI>life</HI> to preserve you both; but you require what is infinitely more precious!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fy! fy upon it! how like a woman this is!—Your sister, a romantic girl, could do no more than sooth me with fine speeches; I expected a more substantial proof of filial love from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you wound me deeply by such a cruel charge. What have I not already done to shew my duty, or, what with me was much stronger, my <HI>love</HI> for you, my Lord? Have I not given up my birth-right? put it wholly in your power to alienate for ever, if you please, my family inheri∣tance, and leave me a beggar? Is not this a substantial proof? My Lord, I beg your pardon; but you have wrung my very heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have wrung mine—for, Medway, with equal grief and shame I speak it, I <HI>have</HI> made you a beggar; I have mortgaged the last foot of land I was possessed of in the world, and the only prospect I had of redeeming it, was by this lady's fortune; that would have recovered all, and restored you to the estate of your ancestors. I thought a boyish passi∣on might have been overcome, when such important motives for it were united, as your own interest, and the honour of your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for my own interest, my Lord, it is but a feather in the scale; and for the rest, I think my own honour (which you yourself taught me to prize) is more concerned in this event, than that of my family can possibly be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="710"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told me you were not engaged by promise to the lady.</P>

<P>I am not, my Lord; but are there no ties but what the law can vindicate? Oh my Lord, you forget the lessons you have given me on other occasions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—I acknowledge the justness of your re∣proach; but it comes like a bearded arrow from a child's lips—But I have done—I give up the cause—Had this affair, on which I had set my heart, succeeded, I should per∣haps have been happier than I desire to be—I had this morn∣ing been laying down a plan—but no matter, it is all over—I am sorry your mother should be a suffer with me—I have not been the kindest husband—but I did intend, after I had seen you and my daughter settled, to have retired into the country on a moderate annuity; and there, Medway, I might perhaps have led a very different life from what you have been used to see; but I must struggle with ill fortune as well as I can—You have been a worthy son, I acknowledge it—You have done enough—You shall not charge me with making you miserable for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, my Lord, I wish you had kept up your resentment; I cannot bear to hear you talk in this strain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means; but take my advice, Medway, and do not trust yourself to see her. Write what you have to say, for sighgs and tears are infectious things.

<P>My Lord, I dare not permit myself to think upon the subject—I will take your advice, and write to her whilst my resolution's warm.</P>

<P>Do so then; mean while I'll prepare Mrs. Knightly (as we know each other's mind on the occasion) to receive you in a character in which I am sure she longs to receive you; but, my dear Medway, assume a chearful air when you visit her; that look would throw a damp on all.</P>

<P>Go and send Miss Richly to me. <STAGE>[Exit Maid.]</STAGE> What a mortifying situation am I in! to have made advances to a man, who, instead of stepping forward to receive them, shrinks back—My Lord Medway I know would gladly pro∣mote a union between his son and me. The backwardness on his side then, can proceed from no other cause, but a pre-en∣gagement of his heart. Yet that may be got over; but if (as I fear) my sister loves him, I must not come to any explanation with her; for whilst I seem ignorant of it, I am not obliged to compliment her at the expence of my own quiet—I begin to wish her out of my sight.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Miss</HI> Richly:</STAGE>
<P>Have you done the work I left you, with Clara?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not imagine you had given it to me as a task, sister—I have done nothing to it yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot conceive what you have got into that head of yours, child; for of late you never do any thing that I desire—I think I never saw so strange an alteration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, sister, the alteration is in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh your servant, ma'am, you have learnt to contradict too—but it would become you, Clara, to re∣member I am your elder sister; and tho'there is no great diffe∣rence in our years, yet I think the state you are in should teach you a little more respect to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, sister, I do not want to be hourly re∣minded of that; I am sufficiently humbled already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Clara, I believe you will
<PB N="75" REF="740"/>
find humility the most useful virtue you can practise; and that you may have a better opportunity of doing so, I have thought of placing you in a sober retired family in the country; and who knows but you may captivate some rural 'squire, and then you may live according to your own taste you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell her at once to punish her for her cruel∣ty. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Perhaps, sister, I may have it in my power to do so without captivating a rural 'squire—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it; but we won't talk of your visionary schemes at present. (I won't let her explain herself.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a gentleman, sister—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, keep him to yourself; I'll hear none of your love-secrets.</P>
<STAGE>Enter a servant, and delivers a note to Mrs. Knightly.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>From my Lord Medway, madam; the servant waits for an answer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>My compliments to his Lordship, and shall be glad of the Colonel's company. <STAGE>[Exit Serv.]</STAGE> You were go∣ing to say something of a gentleman, Clara, ha, ha, pray who <HI>is</HI> the gentleman? But before you tell me <HI>your</HI> secret, I'll inti∣tle myself to the favour by making you <HI>my</HI> confidant. I have made a conquest you must know, of which this billet informs me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>A conquest, sister! I thought this note had come from Lord Medway.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so it does, and the conquest is, tho' not <HI>of</HI> Lord Medway, yet of one who I hope <HI>will</HI> be Lord Medway—I'll read you the note.</P>

<P>What do you say to this, Clara! Is your lover as pretty a fel∣low as Colonel Medway?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly,</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sister, this is too much! but I give you joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, child! Why surely, my dear Clara, thou couldst not have any design, upon the Colo∣nel! Could you suppose that a man of family like him would marry without a fortune to support his rank and title?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied I was mistaken, madam, and shall now be obliged to you if you will send me into the country di∣rectly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, my dear, I think you judge right. I am sorry you have been so imprudent as to suffer any little gallantries, with which the Colonel might have treat∣ed you, to take a serious hold on you; but since it has hap∣pened so unluckily, I own I think it will be rather aukward for you to be in the house on the occasion; for, to tell you the truth, I intend to marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, sister, I will, if you please, retire for the present, to the house of my friend who brought me up, till you are at leisure to dispose of me otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly right, my dear; I am pleased at this mark of your discretion—We don't part in an∣ger, Clara; I shall always be your sincere friend, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so, sister—I will just go and give a few directions to the servant, and then come to take my leave of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will not then be long in giving your

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Knightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Clara! I pity you, and am sorry to build my happiness on the ruin of <HI>your's;</HI> but I'll make you amends. I see she loves, but 'tis plain she is not beloved. Per∣haps 'tis really as I said, and he has won her affections by a few compliments, meant only in gaieté de coeur. I hope that may be the case; for, notwithstanding my tenderness for him, I have delicacy enough to be unhappy, if I did not wholly possess his heart.</P>

<P>Bless me, what can be the matter with my sister! she seems

strangely agitated—she was reading a letter—it was not that which she just now shewed to me.—What can it be? but I'll not intrude to ask her; I believe she can dispense with the ceremony of an adieu, and I can depart without one.</P>

<P>I did not expect this, Clara! I thought you would have spared me the pangs of such a meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not designed, Sir, believe me; yet, if you had vouchsafed to have given me but a little notice of this visit, it would have been but kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought my letter, distracted as it was—would at least have prevented an interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What letter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you receive one from me within this half hour? it was the earliest notice I could give you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I received none; but now you mention it, I am afraid it has fallen into my sister's hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, then, Clara, what a monster must I appear to you? ignorant as you are of the motives of my strange con∣duct, which in that letter I explained at full.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I am but ill prepared for such a sud∣den shock—yet I am willing to believe you must have had strong reasons for what you have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can the generosity of your heart admit it as an ex∣cuse for my leaving you, that it is to save from utter and immediate ruin, a father that I dearly love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can, Sir, and honour you for the motive; for I am sure that nothing else could have brought about such an event; and I should little deserve that esteem which I hope you still retain for me, if I could not give up <HI>my</HI> seeble claim to your tenderness, for ties of so much more impor∣tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Clara, why did I give you up? what have I got to compensate for your loss!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your virtue! the consciousness of having act∣ed right—You have broke no oaths, no promises to me; nay,
<PB N="79" REF="780"/>
I have often told you I would never be your's but with your father's consent; for sunk as I am in fortune, I would not meanly creep into a family that rejected me. And for this reason, I would neither give, nor receive a vow; but left you at full liberty to make a better choice, when your duty or your interest should urge you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That last word, madam, carries a reproach in it, which I cannot bear from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not mistake me, Sir; I have not the least suspicion, that interest has the smallest share in this action—I wish it had—for then perhaps I should part with you with less reluctance, than now I own I have power to do—but we must not touch upon this string—My sister loves you, and I hope will make you happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Happy</HI> do you say! no, Clara, no, happiness and I have shaken hands; what I have done to-day has made a wretch of me for life.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir—shew more indifference, if you would not have me repine too much, at my own sad fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is mine then, Clara, condemned to losing what is dearer to me than life; with the superadded grief of giving up my days to one I cannot love.<HI>—Your</HI> condition is not quite so wretched; <HI>you</HI> still are free, and time may in∣cline you to bestow your heart upon some happy man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, never.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not say so—I had but that hope left to keep me from desperation—If I lose it, I shall forget all obligati∣ons, and give my father up to poverty and shame.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more I beseech you, Sir—you have made a noble sacrifice of your love—do not lose the merit of your silial goodness, by repenting of an act, that raises you higher even in <HI>my</HI> esteem.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think on your unhappy father, Sir! let that keep up your resolution. I grant you have a difficult task, for my sister may possibly think herself affronted by the expla∣nation you have made in that letter, which has fallen into her hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope she may!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Richly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, do not indulge in such a vain hope, 'tis but a surmise of mine, and may have nothing in it—I know she suspected our attachment to each other, yet that did not check the progress of her love.—I am going to quit her house directly, and this, Sir, for my own, for my sister's, and for your sake, is the last time we must ever meet—forget me, Sir, and try—I conjure you try to be happy—</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clara—stay—stay!—So! all's at an end—and the hope I had nourished for years is vanished like a dream.—This trial was more than I thought I could sup∣port; but her noble firmness, I believe, made me ashamed to sink quite under the blow that has parted us for ever—I wish I were out of this fatal house—for I am very unfit to act the lover's part.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> Medway.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now, Medway! what is the meaning of this? alone, and with a countenance of despair! I bid you wear a better face. Where's Mrs. Knightly? have you not seen her yet? I thought, by this time, to have found you at her feet, and as I passed by the door, stepped in to help you to make love; for I know your heart is not warm in the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord I am very glad you are come; you must, indeed, make love for me; for I assure you I am in no condi∣tion to speak for myself</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's the matter, man? I suppose Miss Richly and you have been whining over one another; did not I warn you against that, George, and bid you write to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I did, my Lord; but unfortunately she did not re∣ceive my letter; so that by accident we met just now, not, I assure you, with the least design on either side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="81" REF="800"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was unlucky; but how came she to miss of your letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a circumstance still more unlucky, for she is afraid her sister got it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a curst untoward accident, if that be so! yet her love for you will make her overlook all this. 'Twas but a thing of course, mere gallantry.—I'll lead you to her, and turn it off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg of you, my Lord, to see her first alone; she does not yet know that I am come; the servant conducted me to this room, supposing she was here, and lucky was it for me that it happened otherwise; her sister's presence so disconcert∣ed me, that I should have acquitted myself but very ill to∣wards <HI>her.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she expects you by this time; a lover and out∣stay his appointment! for shame, George!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let me beseech your Lordship to dispense with my seeing her just now; I'll take a turn or two in the Park, and endeavour to compose myself; and if my passion for her sister should be mentioned, <HI>you,</HI> my Lord, can, with a better grace than I, give it what turn you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—perhaps it may be better so. I own I had rather she should speak of that to <HI>me</HI> than to you: get you gone quickly—I'll prepare the way for you—She admits me to her toilet.</P>

been accomplished, into what a horrid gulph should I have plunged my children. It makes my blood run cold to think of it.—I was born for destruction, and the ruins I have made myself are now come tumbling on my head.

<P>Mrs. Knightly—she to whom I would have join∣ed you—I find is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Medway!—my own daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You amaze me, my Lord—how did you discover it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I went to sollicit for you, I found her in her
<PB N="83" REF="820"/>
closet, under great agitation, on account of the letter you had written to her sister.—I pleaded for you, but found her a∣verse and cold.—In a little pause of discourse, I happened to cast my eyes on the picture of a lady, which hung just before me, and was struck with the resemblance of a beauty whom, in my early days, I loved, and cruelly betrayed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, my Lord, to have heard you speak of some such thing—a lady, who, when you made your first campaign in Portugal, gave you her love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same—I thought the injured countenance seem∣ed to frown upon me. Surprized at the sight, I hastily de∣manded whose the picture was, and was told by Mrs. Knight∣ly 'twas her mother's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must, indeed, my Lord, have shocked you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, 'twas nothing to what I suffered after, when farther urging her to satisfy my curiosity, she told me her mother's name and family! The apparent confusion this threw me into, rouzed her in her turn to ask me some que∣stions, which brought about this amazing explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She could not know you by your name, my Lord, as it was since my birth you assumed <HI>that</HI> with the title of Med∣way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.—She had heard of me by my own family name, and asked me, with a faultering voice, whether I had not formerly been at Lisbon, and borne the name of Selby. My acknowledging that I had, threw her into agonies, from which I, with difficulty, recovered her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you never know, my Lord, that you had a daugh∣ter by that Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, no! I was recalled to England early in my amour with her. I married soon after my return, and, thoughtless and young as I then was, never enquired after her more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then, my Lord, can you be certain of this fact?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Medway! by too sure an evidence—The pe∣nitence and deep remorse of a dying woman! The unhappy lady confessed the secret, with all its circumstances, to this her daughter, when she was on her death-bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="84" REF="830"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Knightly, then, had passed for Mr. Richly's daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had; the match between him and her mother was hastily concluded by her friends, immediately after my departure. At the time of this lady's birth, Mr. Richly was absent on his affairs in the Indies; and tho' she came into the world in less than seven months after the marriage, yet (this circumstance being carefully concealed from him) he never doubted of her being his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Clara! she then has been doubly wronged, in being deprived of her birth-right, as well as in losing the un∣equal portion which her father left her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the cause which wrung the secret from her dying mother's breast. Her deceased husband had, through a partial fondness for his supposed eldest daughter, left her such a disproportionate share of his wealth; and the mother, in divulging the secret, charged Mrs. Knightly, with her last breath, to do justice to her sister. This she herself, in the hurry of her shame, surprize, and grief, acknowledged to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I long to know, my Lord, what resulted from this ex∣traordinary interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Knightly's agitations are not to be described. She wept and wrung her hands. I mixed my tears with her's; and, while she fell on her knees before me, I involuntarily dropped on one of mine, and begged of her to accept a bles∣sing from her repentant father. She strained me to her bo∣som; then rising with a noble air, she made a sorrowful and silent motion with her hand that I should leave her. I did so; and hastened home, to brood over my own reflections—Oh such reflections! such reflections, George!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, there is something so extraordinary in this event, that it looks as if Providence itself had interposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Medway, 'tis for your sake then; I do not de∣serve the care of heaven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, my Lord, you will not entertain such despond∣ing thoughts, but hope the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>George! there's no foundation <HI>here</HI> for hope; I
<PB N="85" REF="840"/>
want that <HI>within</HI> which should support me. It is not the flashiness of wit, or vanity of superior talents, that can avail me in an hour like this. I'd give them all, nay, the whole world, were I master of it, to be possessed of such a virtuous self-acquitted heart as yours.</P>
</SP>

<P>My Lord, I owe my sister a large amends for the distress I have occasioned her on more accounts than one, and you in your turn, I think should recompense your son for the sacrifice he was willing to make to you. Has he your permission to make Clara his bride?</P>

<P>Oh, madam, you are too, too good.</P>

<L>The piece—you know the Ladies never hiss.</L>
<L>And tho' they should condemn it, yet the men sure</L>
<L>Will leave a woman's faults to women's censure.</L>
<L>They, prone to meekness, charity, and love,</L>
<L>Are always silent where they can't approve.</L>
<L>But if to loud applause we dare to aim,</L>
<L>It is the men must ratify our claim.</L>
