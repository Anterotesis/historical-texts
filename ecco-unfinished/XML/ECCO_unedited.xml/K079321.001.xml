<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW offer to the Public, the substance of those observa∣tions
on the description and punishment of Crimes, which,
in the discharge of my duty, as Professor of the Law of
Scotland in the University of Edinburgh, I have for some
years had occasion to deliver, as part of a course of Aca∣demical
Lectures. And when I give them this form, for
which I cannot plead the same obligation, I am sensible that
some apology is due to my countrymen, and more especially
to my Brethren at the Bar, for the boldness of the under∣taking.</P>
<P>IN one, however, and the principal excuse, I hope to be
in some measure anticipated by the reader. It is this: That
I am not professing to give him new light on a subject which
has been already handled by accurate and able authors; but
am only introducing him to the elements of a part of our
practice, upon which, important as it is, the lawyer may
almost be said to be without one printed authority to re∣sort,
to.</P>
<P>WHEN I say so, I am far from intending (I know indeed
that such an attempt would be fruitless, and prudence, if
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="31"/>
not a sense of justice, would restrain me) to depreciate the me∣rits
of the <HI>Treatise concerning the Law of Scotland in Matters Cri∣minal,</HI>
published in 1678, by that eloquent and ingenious law∣yer,
Sir George Mackenzie. Certainly, whatever may be its
imperfections, his work was a valuable present to the lawyers
of his day; and this I may safely say, that if we were possessed
of any general system applicable to the practice of our times,
and written with the same learning and ingenuity, or contain∣ing
the like detail of the judgments of Court, and of the rules
of our municipal custom, the present publication would never
have seen the light. But it is well known, that with the ex∣ception
of <HI>Maclaurin's Criminal Cases,</HI> and those since pub∣lished
by Mr Arnot, which are but a partial selection, and
do not propose to give any general exposition of the law,
later times have added almost nothing to our stock of know∣ledge
in this department. It is true that Erskine, in his va∣luable
Institute of the Law of Scotland, professes to treat of
the rules as well of our Criminal as of our Civil Practice.
But of this part of his work, which at any rate is much too
brief to be of any material service in real business, I may
be allowed to say, (for in this I am not pretending to lead,
but am following the public opinion), that it is not of the
same high authority as the other; nor has been formed upon
the same accurate and extensive research into the records
and decisions of Court, which are the only key to the pe∣culiar
practice of Scotland respecting crimes. The same re∣mark
is no less applicable to Mr Forbes's Institute of the Cri∣minal
Law; which is little more than a set of hasty notes of
the contents of our statutes, without any inquiry into what
has been argued or decided.</P>
<P>THUS, on the whole, the lawyer has to gain his know∣ledge
of this, certainly the noblest and most interesting part
<PB N="xxxix" REF="32"/>
of his profession, from the perusal of one work, composed up∣wards
of a century ago, and in times so very different from
the present, that, even if it were in every instance an accu∣rate
and faithful delineation of the law and practice as they
then stood; still it would be found to give a very defective,
and often erroneous account of what is now the law, and
to require a very ample commentary, to accommodate it to
the uses of our day.</P>
<P>THIS will not appear surprising to one who considers the
great change which has happened since the time of Sir
George Mackenzie, in the manners, and temper, and way of
thinking of the nation; by which the state of its Criminal
Law, and its application to real business, must always, in a
great measure, be affected. For although, in any tolerably well
governed country, the decision of an individual case ought,
and in general does depend, not on the wishes and feelings
of the people, or any part of the people, with respect to the
persons concerned, but solely on the letter of the law and
the state of the fact; yet the general spirit of that law will
always, in some measure, be bent and accommodated to the
temper and exigencies of the times; directing its severity
against those crimes which the manners of the age breed a
direct abhorrence of, or which the present condition of the
people renders peculiarly hurtful in their consequences to
private or to public peace. The method, too, of detecting
crimes, and of carrying on the trial, must be affected by the
manners of the people; since the course of process will na∣turally
vary, according as there is more or less danger that
justice will be perverted, or frustrated, by falsehood and
corruption, by private malice, or by the rancorous animo∣sity
of civil dissensions.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="33"/>
THE law of civil rights undergoes its changes too, as the
state of a people in regard to its political situation alters;
but the changes are never so rapid, nor so extensive, as in
the criminal jurisprudence. One strong reason for which is,
that with respect to the former, although it may often be a
subject of inquiry to the understanding, whether one or
other practice be the more expedient; yet in the greater
number of cases, our moral feelings are altogether indiffe∣rent;
which they never can be on a question whether
a particular action or course of conduct is or is not a fit ob∣ject
of punishment. There are some of our civil institu∣tions,
which perhaps might be altered with advantage; but
still there is no feeling of dislike or abhorrence of the per∣sons
who enjoy what the present law gives them; nor any
very strong sympathy and compassion towards those who
are deprived of some advantages, which, on a different plan,
might have fallen to their lot. And thus the practice of old
times extends to the present; without giving us any shock or
uneasiness. Now, it is quite otherwise in the matter of
crimes. Take, for instance, the case of witchcraft. The
possibility of such a crime was once believed; and the me∣thods
of detecting it were also thought to be properly, and
even ingeniously, contrived. But we have recovered from
this strange and miserable delusion: and I am sure it will
not be disputed, that even if the statute which forbids any
prosecution for this crime had not been enacted, yet the
manners and temper of the age would effectually have
abrogated the ancient law; and would have suffered no
such trials to be attempted, as our ancestors, at no very di∣stant
period, often witnessed without disapprobation.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="34"/>
FROM this natural correspondence between the state of
the Criminal Law, and the condition of the people as to its
manners and ways of feeling, it will easily be understood
why Sir George Mackenzie's treatise should be defective in
its application to our present practice. For at the time of
its publication, this country had advanced but little in any
sort of improvement; and indeed, whether we consider it
with respect to the administration of its Government, its
internal discipline and oeconomy, or the opinions, temper,
and habits of the people, it was at that time utterly remote
from what Scotland has since become.</P>
<P>IN this penury, therefore, of information, having, in the
course of my duty as Public Teacher of the Law, particularly
directed my attention to the department of Crimes; and ha∣ving
gone over the whole series of the <HI>Books of Adjournal,</HI> (for
so the records of the Court of Justiciary are called); I hope
I may at least be excused for the attempt of saving others
the labour of the like research, for which not many
persons can be supposed to have either leisure or inclina∣tion.</P>
<P>ONE other motive, and I trust not an unworthy one, has,
I confess, thus far at least had weight with me, that it has
determined me to make this publication earlier, than per∣haps
I should otherwise have been disposed to. I mean the
desire of rescuing the law of my native country from that
state of declension in the esteem of some part of the public,
into which, of late years, it seems to have been falling;
owing, I am persuaded, to this more than any other cause,
that they are ignorant of what it really is. This disposi∣tion,
in particular, appears in those multiplied references to
<PB N="xlii" REF="35"/>
the Criminal Law of England, and those frequent and extrava∣gant
encomiums on the English practice, in preference to our
own; which, in any point where the two differ, is calumniated
as rude and barbarous, nay is sometimes even spoken of as
grievous and oppressive. This is an opinion, which, for my
own part, I am unwilling to learn; and in which I have
not yet found any preceptor, who had sufficient skill or elo∣quence
to persuade me. So far from it, that all such in∣vectives,
indecent and hurtful as they certainly are, appear
to me withal to be unjust and groundless in themselves; and
to proceed upon a very partial and narrow view of the sub∣ject.</P>
<P>THAT the Law of England respecting Crimes is a liberal
and enlightened system, (having gradually ripened, by the
experience of ages, among a people who well understand the
nature of a rational and moderate freedom); and that as
such,—as a body of written wisdom,—it is entitled to de∣ference,
and may with propriety be quoted in those mat∣ters
which our own customs or statutes have not settled:—
All this, what reasonable person will dispute? Farther; I
will readily admit, that in many things our practice has not
yet attained to the same maturity and consistency as that of
our sister kingdom: That offences are not reduced, through∣out,
in their description and several divisions, to the same
orderly and systematic shape; and that we have still to settle
many points of our form of process, which have long ceased
to be the subject of controversy in the English Courts. But
of all this, how true soever, I have only to observe, that
how should we expect to find the case otherwise, in compa∣ring
our law with that of a country, where, from the much
greater number of dissolute and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligate people, and from
<PB N="xliii" REF="36"/>
the greater progress of every, refinement, and of every sort of
corruption. crimes are both more frequent, and far more vari∣ous
in their nature, than among ourselves; so that through
the greater number of trials, and the repeated application
to every sort of offence, their law forms a more complete
system, and extends its rules, drawn from actual decisions,
to a greater number of questions. But will it therefore be
said, that, purely by way of fixing things, it would be right
to extend the whole of this enormous code to Scotland,
where the same evils are not yet known, and the same ques∣tions
have not yet occurred? Or, on the other hand, is it to
be conceived, that there would be good sense or propriety
in adopting this or t'other article of the English practice,
without regard had to its suitableness or analogy, either to
our general system, or to the circumstances of the depart∣ment
of practice on which it is to be engrafted? Surely
it is a shortsighted and narrow wisdom, which thus takes
up the several points of practice separately and by them∣selves;
when nothing is more certain, than that every one
part has more or less relation to another; and that many
things, which, considered singly, may seem to be too rigo∣rous,
or too indulgent, are, however, when examined as
parts of one whole, found to be neither way excessive, but
altogether suitable and proper; being coupled to other provi∣sions
of an opposite tendency, which serve to counteract them,
and to hinder the evil that might otherwise ensue. Now,
if this be true of the different parts of any one system of
law, it ought to teach us the greatest diffidence and caution
in comparing the laws of different countries, even when both
are fully known to us; and much more, (as in our case),
when our acquaintance with one of them is so imperfect.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="37"/>
AMONG many instances that might be given, I shall men∣tion
but one, of this fancied excellence of the Law of Eng∣land
being in a great measure a delusion, which has sprung
from the looking to only one rule in the criminal process,
without attending to the others. What I allude to is the
complaint which we often hear, of our want of the peremp∣tory
challenge of the jurors, and of that punctilious and
critical precision respecting the terms of the indictment
and record, which is observed in the English Courts. But
those who expatiate on this grievance, entirely forget,
that, (except in case of treason, by provision of modern
statutes), no prisoner in England sees his indictment, or
knows what the charge against him is, till he stands ar∣raigned
on it in the face of Court; and that he is till then
in equal ignorance who the persons are that are summon∣ed
to his jury, and who the witnesses that are to be used
against him. Whereas with us, he must have full infor∣mation
in all these important articles, fifteen days at least
before his trial; and has thus far better opportunity than
the prisoner in any trial before an English Court, to disco∣ver
and prepare any reasonable objections that may lie to
the indictment, witnesses, or jurors, or any of them. He has
too with us the farther advantage, in every instance, of Coun∣sel
to address the jury, and conduct his defence; which
no prisoner in England has upon the issue of guilty or not
guilty, in any capital case, except in trials for treason. And
here, with reference to the indulgence which is shown in
these particulars to such who are under trial for that high
crime, I cannot forbear to insert the observations of Sir Mi∣chael
Foster on that occasion. “The furnishing the prisoner
with the names, professions, and places of abode of the
witnesses and jury, so long before the trial, may serve many
bad purposes, which are too obvious to be mentioned. One
<PB N="xlv" REF="38"/>
good purpose, and but one it may serve. It giveth the
prisoner an opportunity of informing himself of the cha∣racter
of the witnesses and jury. But this single advan∣tage
will weigh very little, in the scale of justice or sound
policy, against the many bad ends that may be answered
by it. However, if it weigheth any thing in the scale of
justice, the Crown is entitled to the same opportunity of
sifting the character of the prisoner's witnesses.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown Law, p. 250.</NOTE> Surely
it ought to be a lesson to us, of the moderation and diffi∣dence
to be observed with respect to all opinions on subjects
of this kind, when we find this able and excellent author,—
an author too, who has distinguished himself as a popular
lawyer, and strenuous advocate in the cause of freedom,—
thus expressing himself rather in dispraise of these humane
provisions; which to us, who are habituated to them, as the
ordinary course of process, seem to be indispensible to a fair
and equitable trial.</P>
<P>ANOTHER topic, on which also it is not uncommon to hear
encomiums passed at our own expence, is the greater huma∣nity
of the English practice, which requires the unanimity
of the Twelve Jurors in their verdict. But, (to pass over all
inquiries concerning the substance of this rule); if the jury
must be unanimous in their voice, they are however warrant∣ed
to convict, and even in capital cases are in the use of do∣ing
so, upon the testimony, if positive and explicit, of a single
witness: A sort of proof, how reputable soever the witness,
which no Scots Jury can lawfully pay regard to, in any the
most inconsiderable case. Add to this, that the prisoner in
Scotland has the same aid of Court, as the prosecutor, for
compelling his witnesses to appear. Likewise, every witness
that is produced against the prisoner, has right to see his de∣claration
<PB N="xlvi" REF="39"/>
cancelled before deposing on the trial; so as he
may be at absolute freedom in giving his evidence upon oath.
The witnesses too are examined out of the presence of
each other, which obviates any risk of a combination against
the prisoner; and after being examined and dismissed, no
witness can again be called on, to explain what he has said,
nor to supply omissions: Things, (as I understand it), all or
most of them quite foreign to the English form of process,
where the opposite practices are established, and are even
thought to be essential, (and possibly they are so as matters
are managed with them), to the execution of criminal justice.
Notice may also be taken of the jealousy which actuates our
custom, of all intercourse between the Judge and jury. In
so much that the verdict, once delivered into Court, can∣not
on any pretence be retracted, nor even amended or
explained, but must be received and taken with all its
imperfections, how glaring soever, on its head. An English
jury, on the contrary, are conversed with, reinclosed, que∣stioned
and instructed by the Court, without any manner of
restraint.</P>
<P>IN short, the whole train of proceedings in this or any
other country, must be taken into consideration, in judging
of any part. And if upon a complex view of the entire
process, the prisoner appears to have a fair and equitable trial,
in which innocence runs no risk of being ensnared or sur∣prised;
it is all that a reasonable man can wish for, and all
perhaps that is attainable to human wisdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown Law, p. 231.</NOTE> “It is impos∣sible”
(says Foster) “in a state of imperfection to keep
clear of all inconveniences; though wisdom will always
direct us to the course which is subject to the fewest
and the least, and this is the utmost that human wisdom
<PB N="xlvii" REF="40"/>
can do.” Now I think it is impossible, that any person
of candour, who will attend to our course of trial from the
outset to the close, shall seriously believe that the prisoner
has not all humane attention shown to his condition, and all
due provision made for his just defence.</P>
<P>THESE observations respect the comparison of our Criminal
Law with that of England, in the important matter of the
form of trial; and as far as concerns the security of inno∣cence,
I see no reason to think, that there is any disadvan∣tage
on our side.</P>
<P>I THINK it may also be doubted, whether the complaint
is better founded respecting that part of our system, which
lodges the power of prosecution with a public officer, the
Lord Advocate; by whom it is exercised according to his
own judgment and discretion. For what are the evils,
which have been found in practice to attend this plan of ac∣cusation?
Or is it not rather certain, that to this very course
of proceeding, which places the entire responsibility for all
prosecutions with one individual of high rank and reputa∣tion,
(who therefore, on his own account, will be cautious
and reserved in the exercise of his powers), we owe the
singular and constant moderation, which has prevailed,
time out of mind, in the administration of this part of pub∣lic
justice. Certainly, it cannot be disputed, that by this
contrivance, the prosecutor is most effectually removed from
the contagion of that popular prejudice, either for or against
the accused, which is apt to arise in any case of an extraor∣dinary
or interesting nature. And with respect to the risk
of the influence of the Crown; it is true, that in an arbitra∣ry
government, where the whole frame and order of things
<PB N="xlviii" REF="41"/>
tends to make the favour of the Sovereign the chief ob∣ject
of regard, and the sole means of preferment, such an
institution might be made an engine of injustice. But
there is no inference from thence to the situation of
things in this country; where such is the care of freedom,
the love of justice, and such the high influence of the popular
part of the constitution, that any person holding the office
of Lord Advocate who should strain his powers, or pervert
them to oppressive purposes, would injure alike his own re∣putation
and fortune, and the service of the Crown. And
as, on the one hand, the inhabitants of Scotland have no∣thing
to fear, and in truth have never suffered, (since the Re∣volution
at least), from the privileges of this office; so, on the
other it is impossible to deny the high and extensive benefits
which attend it, in maintaining the police of the country, and
securing the prosecution of every criminal whose case requires
it, without any trouble, or a shilling even of expence, to the
party injured. In that respect the rule of the English system,
which in ordinary cases commits the prosecution only to that
party, and lays on him the whole care and expence of obtain∣ing
a conviction, seems at least, (and, if I have not been
misinformed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Since writing these remarks, I have seen <HI>a Treatise on the Police of the Me∣tropolis,</HI> (written by an author who has the best opportunities of observing the operation of the English system of prosecution), which makes a heavy, and seemingly well grounded complaint, of the great obstacles to the execution of justice which arise from that source. See Chap. X.</NOTE>, this is felt and complained of in their prac∣tice),
to be less advantageously contrived for repressing the
growth of crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="42"/>
IN regard to another important point, the determining of
the proper punishment of a crime when proved. I know
some have imagined that the law of England, which fixes
the matter by the precise letter of a statute, is preferable to
ours, which in a great number of instances leaves it to the
discretion of the Judge. Yet it is to this part of our system,
that we are perhaps chiefly indebted for the gentleness of
our punishments; which, compared with those used for the
same offences by other nations, is, generally speaking, most
eminent; but which, nevertheless, we have hitherto found
sufficient to maintain a greater degree of good order and
peace, than exists in any other country so far advanced as
this in the arts and resinements of life, and consequently so
much exposed to the vices which attend them.</P>
<P>THAT our law is more rigorous than that of England in
regard to certain articles, where, unhappily, there has of late
been so much occasion to compare the two; this I feel as
little inclination as power to dispute. Our ancient statutes
animadverted with severity on those offences, which the
factious and unruly temper of the inhabitants of this coun∣try
made it indispensible to repress. And although it might
have been expected, that in so long a period of increasing
prosperity, and of mild and equitable government, as has
elapsed since the latest of these laws, this vice of our dispo∣sition
might in some measure have been corrected; yet have
we, in the events of our own day, seen too much reason to
commend in this particular the wisdom of our Legislature,
and to be thankful for the powers which they have bestowed
upon our Courts.</P>
<P><PB N="l" REF="43"/>
BUT explain this instance any way, it never will decide
the question as to the general temper of our law; of which
if any one wishes to form a just opinion, let him attend to
the inconsiderable number of lives which fall a forfeit to its
rules. I am certain that I am within the truth, when I men∣tion,
that on an average of thirty years preceding the year
1797, the executions for all Scotland have not exceeded six in
a year. For a period of fifteen years, preceding the 1st May
1782, the number of persons who suffered death at Edinburgh,
(where by far the greater number of capital trials take
place), amounted only to twenty-three; that is, in every
two years only three persons suffered death. And as to
the inferior punishments, I have it from good authority,
that one quarter-sessions, for the single town of Manchester,
have sent more felons to the plantations, than all the Scots
Judges do for ordinary in a twelvemonth. Near thirty
years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. iv. p. 18.</NOTE> when Judge Blackstone first published his Com∣mentaries,
that author remarked, and expressed his regret,
that there were then no fewer than one hundred and sixty
offences, which had been declared by act of Parliament
to be felonies without benefit of clergy. At the largest al∣lowance,
and taking in all that are provided for at common
law, as well as by statute, (of which last a great propor∣tion
have long been completely obsolete), our list of capital
crimes does not amount to more than a fourth part of that
number. Such is the law, which, by ill informed persons,
is reproached as sanguinary and tyrannical in comparison of
others; and such the means, by which upwards of a mil∣lion
and a half of people are secured in the enjoyment of
all the benefits of the most improved society.</P>
<P><PB N="li" REF="44"/>
I REPEAT it therefore, without fear of contradiction, that
generally speaking, and with a view to the ordinary course
of vulgar practice, (for by this the question must be decided),
our custom of punishment is eminently gentle; and would
be ill exchanged, for the offenders at least, and indeed I
think for the country at large, against a numerous list of
special and statutory rules. For plain it is, that if ever we
come to establish any such positive code, the punishments
must needs be stated high; because the Judge could in no
case go beyond them, and not only the young but the more
experienced offender must be corrected. Whereas, by our
custom, as it now is, that object is fully accomplished; and
strict regard is at the same paid, (which wherever it is
practicable, is surely desirable), to the peculiar and equitable
circumstances of each case, as it occurs. Take for instance
the crime of theft. If a statute were now to be passed, fix∣ing
the pains of the several degrees of that offence; is it to
be doubted that the stealing of a horse, or an ox, or of goods
to the value of L. 10, or even of L. 5, must be rated in the
scale as a capital crime; and the Judge be necessitated to
pass sentence of death upon every one who shall be con∣victed
to that extent. But, owing to the discretion which,
in this respect has been reposed with our Judges; how fre∣quently
does it happen, that, by reason of youth, or weak∣ness
of intellect, or because instigated by some old transgres∣sor,
or for other the like favourable circumstance in the case,
offenders of this degree escape with some inferior correc∣tion?
Thus, though at first sight it may seem paradoxical
to allege, that there is any advantage in having the pu∣nishment
of crimes discretionary; yet certain it is, that the
operation of this state of things, in our practice, has not
been against the pannel, but highly in his favour.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="45"/>
AND here, let me observe, that to this very excellence,
(so much extolled), of the definite pains of all crimes in
England, is owing the infinite number of pardons, and com∣mutations
of punishment, which are there found indispen∣sible
to the administration of criminal justice; and which,
compared with those that occur in our practice, are in the
proportion of at least ten to one. A difference, which, con∣sidered
in any point of view, and especially with respect to
its influence in the important article of the prevention of
crimes, certainly will not be thought to be to our disadvan∣tage.</P>
<P>ANOTHER point in which the custom of the two countries
remarkably differs, is with respect to the punishment of new
crimes or modes of transgression. It seems to be held in Eng∣land,
that no Court has power to take cognisance of any new
offence, although highly pernicious, and approaching very
nearly to others which have been prohibited, until some statute
has declared it to be a crime, and assigned a punishment.
With us the maxim is directly the reverse; that the Supreme
Criminal Court have an inherent power as such, competently
to punish, (with the exception of life and limb), every act
which is obviously of a criminal nature; though it be such
which in time past has never been the subject of prosecution.
And certainly this course is at least attended with two advan∣tages.
To the public it is thus far beneficial, that the evil
is repressed in its beginnings, and more effectually than it
ever can be by any statute: Because all statutes are liable to
be partial and defective in their description of new offences<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is particularly exemplified in England, in the long train of statutes which have been found necessary to be passed with respect to the theft of certain commodities, and the receiving of stolen goods.</NOTE>,
<PB N="liii" REF="46"/>
and thus the transgressor finds the means of eluding the
sanction; and the law itself falls into contempt. But it
is also a merciful course to the offender; because the crime
being censured on its first appearance, and before it has be∣come
flagrant or alarming to the community, is restrained
at that season by far milder correctives, than are afterwards
necessary to be applied to it, when the growing evil has
come to require the passing of an express law in that be∣half.
Thus in England, the sending of incendiary or threaten∣ing
letters is punished with death, in virtue of certain sta∣tutes,
which passed at a time when this sort of wickedness pre∣vailed.
But our Judges punished the first offender of this
sort, (whose trial was within these fifty years), with trans∣portation;
and it has never been found necessary to seek
authority for any higher or more rigorous judgment. The
same is true with respect to the corruption or alteration of
bills, promissory-notes and the like, to the prejudice of the
acceptor; which by certain statutes is felony without bene∣fit
of clergy in England, and is punishable with us at com∣mon
law, with transportation. Many other examples might
be given. In short, if things are to be judged of upon the
testimony of experience, and not according to the fallacious
conjectures of human wisdom before the event; the inhabi∣tants
of Scotland have no reason to envy the condition, with
respect to the administration of Criminal Justice, of any
other part of Europe.</P>
<P>WHILE I express myself in these terms, let me not be
thought to intend passing a censure on the practice of Eng∣land,
as impolitic or cruel, in rearing up so great a mass of
penal statutes upon special transgressions. I have no doubt
that their practice is good, and I will presume of the wisdom
<PB N="liv" REF="47"/>
of their Legislature that it is necessary, in their state of
wealth, society, and manners. I only mean to say, that ours
is in all probability at least as well adapted to our own situ∣ation
in those respects.</P>
<P>LET me add, that while I thus disclaim that superstitious
admiration of the English Law, which prevails among some
persons, and especially, like other superstitions, among the
ignorant; and which would set up that system as a standard
of perfection, after the likeness whereof we are to reform and
new-model our own; yet on a proper occasion, and for a pro∣per
purpose, I have been ready to avail myself of the important
assistance which its doctrines may often afford me. I have
already said, that as a great body of written and practical
reason, and recommended by the example of a free and en∣lightened
people, it has every where, and certainly in our
country more than elsewhere, (because the form of our Go∣vernment,
and the general spirit of our jurisprudence are the
same with that of England), a strong claim to deference and
regard. In matters, therefore, which depend on the com∣mon
feelings of equity and right, and are not determined
otherwise by our municipal custom, nor are anywise in∣volved
in it, I have made liberal use of the sentiments, and
sometimes even of the words of the English writers on
law: An obligation, which, as their works cannot properly
be quoted as authorities in a book of Scots Law, I beg leave
in this place, once for all, to acknowledge.</P>
<P>HAVING said thus much of my motives towards the com∣position
of this work, I shall subjoin a few words concern∣ing
the plan and object of the work itself, and the sources
whence I have drawn the doctrine which it contains.</P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="48"/>
IN regard to the first, a very short and simple account
may be given: I mean to open up to the young lawyer the
Elements of our Criminal Practice; and to lay before him
such authorities and materials, as may serve to guide him in
his future researches, and are not to be found in any of our
printed works. This, undoubtedly, and nothing higher, is
the main bent and scope of my undertaking. I have no in∣tention
of bringing forward a Philosophical treatise of Cri∣minal
Jurisprudence, in which the history of the human spe∣cies,
with respect to this branch of the science of law, is to
be traced; and an attempt made to ascertain, on abstract and
universal principles, the nature of the several offences, and
the application and proportion of punishments. Certainly
these are amusing and interesting disquisitions; but they do
not lie within his province, whose attention has chiefly been
turned to the investigation of one peculiar system.</P>
<P>NEITHER have I any intention of turning censor on our
practice; and of suggesting changes and reformations, which
might fit it to some standard of higher perfection than our
forefathers had in view. For this is a very delicate task
indeed; and which those only, from whom their scho∣lastic
vanity and gross ignorance of the real business of
life conceals its difficulty, will be forward to engage
in. Nevertheless, when any thing in our system is con∣fessedly
inconvenient or defective, (and in what system are
not such things to be found), I should conceive it impro∣per
for me to abstain from pointing out that circumstance
to attention. But in taking notice of it, I shall observe that
moderation and diffidence, which every person not abound∣ing
in self-conceit, and who has lived to a certain age, and at∣tained
to some experience, must feel with regard to any opi∣nion
<PB N="lvi" REF="49"/>
of his own, when opposed to that of our forefathers,
and to the practice in time past of the Judges of the land.
Still less shall I think it reasonable, where the occasion of∣fers,
to omit calling the reader's attention to the peculiar
advantages, by which not a few parts of our Criminal sys∣tem
are distinguished. For it is truly doing him a service,
to make him sensible of the many blessings he enjoys under
the subsisting laws of his country.</P>
<P>BUT although, in the composition of these sheets, I have
chiefly had in view the instruction of the lawyer; yet
is not this sort of knowledge entirely without its use even to
the individual, who has to govern his life and conduct in con∣formity
to the precepts which they explain. It cannot but be
interesting to him as a man, to be acquainted with that sys∣tem
of rules and ordinances, according to which, as a citi∣zen
of Scotland, he is to answer for his actions to his fellow
subjects, and to his Sovereign; and by which the trial of his
highest and dearest concerns, his state and condition in so∣ciety,
his freedom, and even his life, must be conducted and
decided. Certainly, he will have the better chance to
prove a good and useful member of the community, and to
demean himself well in all circumstances, and towards all
persons, if he knows what the law has in every case ordered;
and sees the connection which the respective rights and du∣ties
of the different orders of men have, with the maintain∣ance
of that state of society, and that form of Government,
under which he lives. Sir Michael Foster<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Preface to his Discourses on the Crown Law.</NOTE> hath truly said
on this head, “The learning touching these subjects is mat∣ter
of great and universal concernment. It merits, for
<PB N="lvii" REF="50"/>
reasons too obvious to be enlarged on, the attention of
every man living. For no rank, no elevation in life, and
let me add, no conduct, how circumspect soever, ought to
tempt a reasonable man to. conclude, that these inquiries
do not, nor possibly can concern him. A moment's cool
reflection on the utter instability of human affairs, and the
numberless unforeseen events which a day may bring forth,
will be sufficient to guard any man, conscious of his own
infirmities, against a delusion of this kind.”</P>
<P>IN regard to the sources from which my information has
been drawn. I shall begin with a word or two respecting the
Law of Rome; which some may think deserving of notice,
not only as being the law of a great and civilized people,
but even as having pretensions to some sort of authority in
our Courts. But it seems to be the better opinion, (and
such are the sentiments of Sir Thomas Craig, and of Lord
Stair<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>“Nos tamen, in hoc qualicunque regno, Romanorum legibus ita obligamur, qualenus legibus naturae, et rectae rationi congruunt.” Craig de Feudis, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Dieg.</HI> 2. <HI>No.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>“Our customs, as they have arisen mainly from equity, so they are also from the civil, canon, and feudal laws, from which the terms, tenors and forms of them are much borrowed; and therefore, these (especially the civil law), have weight with us, namely, in cases where a custom is not yet formed; But none of these have with us the authority of law, and therefore, are only received ac∣cording to their equity and expediency, <HI>secundum bonum et aequum.</HI>” Stair, b. 1. tit. 1. No. 16.</P></NOTE>), that even in the civil department, the Roman Law
never attained to a binding authority, like that of our own
customs or statutes; nor came to be in any other sense our
law, than as it was long ago, in particular matters, made a
rule of judgment, and thus incorporated into our common
law by the decisions of our Courts; or farther than it is
<PB N="lviii" REF="51"/>
agreeable to equity and reason, or suitable to our situation,
and analogous to the rest of our system. If this be true of
the civil department, much more must it be so of the cri∣minal.
Indeed, if there were even nothing more in the case
but this, that our whole judicial establishments, and modes
of trial, are utterly remote from any thing that was known
among the Romans; this, of itself, is such a difference, as
at once sets up an insurmountable bar to the authority of the
Roman code. For nothing is more certain, than that these
arrangements have a powerful influence on the rules them∣selves
of criminal justice, and the mode of arguing in cri∣minal
matters.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENTLY of this, the truth seems to be, that there
are in every case very great obstacles to the transferring of
the Criminal Law of any one nation to another. Because
in any country, the frame and character of this part of its
laws, has always a much closer dependence upon the pecu∣liar
circumstances of the people, than the detail of its cus∣toms
and regulations in most of the ordinary affairs of ci∣vil
life. The rules of decision respecting contracts and ob∣ligations,
which make a great branch of civil business, must,
in all countries that are tolerably civilized, be governed in
the main by principles of a general and independent nature;
by the common feelings of right and wrong, which are not
liable to be very much affected by the state of the Govern∣ment
of the country, or of its political institutions. It can∣not
be a matter of any concern to the State, or the admini∣strators
of public affairs, by what rule the justice of a claim
of debt, or the right flowing from any fort of common con∣tract,
shall be tried: They have nothing to do in such af∣fairs;
nor can any rules be laid down respecting them, of
<PB N="lix" REF="52"/>
which it can before hand be said, how they are to operate
in those matters where the State may eventually come to
have an interest. But it is quite otherwise as to the law re∣specting
crimes; which has a near relation to the distinc∣tions
of rank among the people, the functions of their Ma∣gistrates,
their institutions and national objects, their reli∣gion,
their state of Government, and their position with re∣spect
to other powers. Now, take the Romans at any pe∣riod
of their history; there are so few points of resemblance
between them and us on any of those matters, that no one
can for a moment seriously reflect on it, without perceiving
that what was natural, suitable, and convenient in their si∣tuation,
has not, from that circumstance, any sort of re∣commendation
to us.</P>
<P>THIS is certainly true in regard to the Roman Law during
the time of the Republic; and applies to it almost equally
in that more advanced state, in which we are best acquaint∣ed
with it. It was by no means to be looked for, (and the
reasons against it are obvious), that the criminal system
should ripen and refine under the Emperors, to the same de∣gree
as did the law of civil rights. Nor did it prove so in
fact. It was on the contrary here, as might be expected,
that the jealousy and violence of every bad Prince, and
the short-sighted policy of every weak one, chiefly display∣ed
itself. Hence, in this department, instead of those
equitable distinctions and comprehensive views, so eminent
in the civil branch, we find a succession of detached and
specific, and often inconsistent ordinances; which were made
according to the demands of the time, or the temper of
the reigning Prince, and were probably, most of them,
no longer observed than while those occasions lasted.
Accordingly, although our lawyers have been in the use of
<PB N="lx" REF="53"/>
resorting to the Roman code for a confirmation of their
arguments in criminal matters; and though of old they
even sometimes set it forth in the preamble of indictments
as law, (in like manner as they did the Canon and Jewish
laws); yet I cannot find that the Imperial constitutions ever
were incorporated into the municipal system, or held to pos∣sess
an authority, farther than as some of them occasionally
express a reasonable sentiment, with a brevity and an ele∣gance
which are fit to recommend it. For these reasons,
though I have not neglected the authorities of the Roman
system, in cases where I find that they have actually been
regarded in our municipal practice; yet I have not other∣wise
engaged in frequent or very extensive discussions with
respect to them.</P>
<P>IF I have thus paid but little regard to the compila∣tions
of Justinian; still less have I thought it material to
detain the reader on every occasion, with a scrutiny into the
sentiments of the numerous commentators on them in mo∣dern
times. Not that I mean to speak of their works as
useless or nugatory in themselves; but that it were very
absurd to look into any of them for an exhibition of the
practice of Scotland, which those foreign authors could know
nothing about. And as to the discussions which they some∣times
enter into of more general topics, such as the nature
of the several crimes, the competency of the several de∣fences
and the like; though many of their observations are
just and rational, yet for the most part they teach nothing
more than any man of plain sense, with a little attention to
the subject, will readily, and to as good purpose, make out
for himself. As Sir George Mackenzie has observed with
<PB N="lxi" REF="54"/>
respect to the quotation of authorities<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Works of Sir George Mackenzie, vol. ii. p. 353.</NOTE>, “he darkens his
own cause, when just, who uses these to ignorant people;
and he lessens his own esteem, who thinks he needs them
among men of better sense.” Besides, if in such matters
we are to resort to authority, for confirmation of what equi∣ty
and reason dictate, the works of the English lawyers are
here entitled to the preference. Both by reason of the near∣er
analogy of the English practice to our own; and because
the general principles upon which a question turns are laid
down by those authors, and the doctrine illustrated with a
precision of language, and soundness of head, not inferior
to what appears in the works of any lawyer or commenta∣tor
of other countries.</P>
<P>THE main store from which I have drawn the materials
of this treatise, is therefore the books of adjournal (or re∣cords
of the Court of Justiciary), containing the pleadings
of the Bar and the judgments of Court; and which ex∣tend,
(though with several interruptions in the sixteenth cen∣tury,
and one of six years<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This is from 1655 to 1661.</NOTE> in the seventeenth), from Novem∣ber
1524, down to the present time. I have gone over the
whole with attention, (in which I have had the assistance of
a gentleman particularly skilled in the decyphering of ancient
manuscripts<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Mr William Anderson, writer in Edinburgh.</NOTE>): and though I am far from doubting that
very many things, both curious and important, still remain
buried there, to reward the industry of any one after me
who shall engage in the like research; yet I flatter myself
<PB N="lxii" REF="55"/>
that I have also brought some things to light, which at least
were not universally known. There is, in the Advocates
Library, a manuscript abridgment of the records of Justi∣ciary;
and of this I have also made use, (but never with∣out
marking it as my authority), for those periods of which
the original records have perished; for this abridgment
must have been made at a time when the books of ad∣journal
were more complete than they are now. These
memorials of our custom, along with Lord Royston's Ma∣nuscript
Notes upon Mackenzie, which contain many judi∣cious
remarks and much valuable information, have been the
main ground-work of this undertaking. In themselves they
are the surest of any; and in order that the reader may be
enabled to judge for himself, how far they support me in
my conclusions, I have, in every instance where it seemed
material or useful, laid the passages themselves of the record
under his eye, in the form of notes, along with the doctrine
of which they are the vouchers and confirmations. It would
be rash to suppose, that in the course of so long a work some
inaccuracies in point of date or quotation may not have crept
in: but as I have not spared pains on this head, (being very
sensible that the value of any performance of this kind de∣pends
entirely on its accuracy); so I hope that they shall
not be found numerous, nor of much importance.</P>
<P>LAST of all, in regard to the order I have followed in
treating of the subject: this is truly a point of less impor∣tance
in explaining the system of Criminal than of Civil
Jurisprudence. Frequently the doctrine of one species of
civil right cannot be understood, till that which con∣cerns
another has been fully explained; and thus there is
an order of inquiry pointed out as the best, by the very
nature of the thing. But the law respecting one sort of
<PB N="lxiii" REF="56"/>
crime scarcely ever stands in such a relation to that which re∣gards
another; so that it is often an almost arbitrary matter,
to what subject the student shall first direct his attention. I
have chosen, therefore, to take up the several crimes in the or∣der
rather of their frequency and practical importance, than
of their rank in other respects. Thus I begin with those offen∣ces
which are committed against individuals, and among
these with the offences against property; after which fol∣low
the several modes of injuring an individual in his person
or his fame. Having exhausted these, I proceed to such of∣fences
as more immediately concern the public; which,
after the example of Judge Blackstone, I have distributed
into several classes: as they are hostile to the course of pub∣lic
justice; to the public peace; to the police and public
oeconomy of the kingdom; or to its interest in point of
trade. The next division includes the high crimes of trea∣son,
sedition, and some others which are levelled directly
against the Sovereign and the State. And the last consists
of those transgressions which relate to God and to religion.</P>
<P>THE title of my present publication, does not embrace any
thing that has relation to the <HI>trial</HI> of crimes, or the <HI>execution</HI>
of criminal justice. Before proceeding to these, which are
not the least arduous part of such an undertaking, I have
thought it better to consult the judgment of the Public, with
respect to the manner in which I have treated that portion
of the subject which is now laid before them. At the same
time, if I should never find leisure to absolve this labour;
what is now published forms a whole by itself, which is in∣dependent
of the other part, and in every place intelligible
without any knowledge of what relates to the form of trial.</P>

<HEAD>NOTA BENE.</HEAD>
<P>IN citing cases in the Records of Justiciary, I have, for the most part,
marked the precise date or dates of the particular proceeding
or proceed∣ings
which are mentioned in the text. In those instances where the re∣ference
in the text is of a more general nature; the reader is to under∣stand
that the date marked, is that on which the libel in the case cited
stands entered in the record. When possessed of this, he has it always in
his power, by attending to the several interlocutors, and adjournments of
diet, to trace the case onwards, in the record, down to its final issue.
In vol. i. p. 6. the case of Niven is erroneously marked as tried in March
1796, instead of December 1795. In the same volume, on the margin of
p. 250. and in the date of the proceedings against Thomas Hall, the year,
viz. 1789, is wanting. On the margin of p. 209. of the same volume,
by an error of the press, 1787 is printed instead of 1597.</P>
<P>In citing the Scots acts of Parliament, I have used the ordinary edi∣tion,
(of which the two first parts by Murray of Glendook), in three small
volumes. I have used the folio edition of Sir George Mackenzie's Trea∣tise
concerning Matters Criminal, printed in 1699.</P>
<P>In regard to English books of law: I have used the first edition of
Blackstone's Commentaries, in four volumes quarto; the folio edition of
1739, of Hawkins Pleas of the Crown; and the folio edition of Sir
Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown, printed in 1736.</P>

DESCRIPTION AND PUNISHMENT

CRIMES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE NATURE OF CRIMES.</HEAD>
<P>IN determining the extent of that part of the law which
has relation to CRIMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE> I shall be guided by the or∣dinary
acceptation of that term, and shall consider every act
as a crime, for which the law of Scotland has appointed
the offender to make satisfaction to the public, beside re∣pairing,
where that can be done, the injury which the indi∣vidual
hath sustained. It is obvious, (and I do not think it
necessary to say more concerning the nature of crimes, as
contradistinguished to civil wrongs), that in exacting any
such atonement of him, the Legislature always proceed on
the opinion of an infringement on his part of that social re∣gard,
<PB N="2" REF="59"/>
which, as a citizen, he owes to the community; whe∣ther
it be that he has violated their security, or their tran∣quillity,
or has trespassed with respect to some of those other
articles of wholesome government and regulation, which af∣fect
the public polity and general welfare of the realm.</P>
<P>Neither, before I enter into the detail of the several of∣fences,
shall I occupy the reader with any inquiry concern∣ing
the source of the right of inflicting punishment, an in∣quiry
which would only be proper, (if it could then take
place), in the very beginnings of society and legislation;
nor with an attempt to trace the natural history of crimes,
and of the establishments for correcting them, through the
different periods of the social state. For, though a research
of this sort would be a proper and most interesting article in
a history of jurisprudence, a noble department certainly of
knowledge, and fit to employ an ingenious mind; yet it
does not fall within the compass of his undertaking, who on∣ly
professes to give a commentary on the special laws of his
own country, as they actually stand. Besides, if such an es∣say
were even in its proper place in a work upon this plan,
it would be reason sufficient against engaging in it, that the
task has already been performed by the hand of a great
matter in this line, (Lord Kames, in his Tract of Criminal
Law), whose remarks if I were not to repeat, it could be
only out of the weak desire of avoiding the path which he
has pointed out to me, and not from any hope of guiding the
student into a better.</P>
<P>If I avoid disquisitions of this sort, which, if not very use∣ful
in the daily practice of courts, might, however, be cu∣rious
and amusing, and certainly would not be attended
with any danger of doing harm, still less shall I think it any
part of my duty, to enlarge at this time in observations on
<PB N="3" REF="60"/>
the due measure, proportion, or application of punishments,
or on the style, the objects, and proper qualities, of pe∣nal
laws, which are rather the business of the political phi∣losopher,
than of the lawyer, and on which subjects, let me
say, much hath been rashly written, in a loose and general
way, by authors but moderately skilled in the business of
life, and very unequal to the arduous task of improving the
science of legislation. I will say farther, that I am deterred
from hazarding any assemblage of precepts towards those ob∣jects,
when I consider that even under the pen of able and
judicious authors, such as Sir William Blackstone, (and cer∣tainly
I cannot mention a stronger instance), these gene∣ral
and prefatory articles have produced so little, which is
not either so trite and obvious, as scarcely to require being
taught, or else, is, in its application to particulars, so liable
to modification and exception, from exigencies of situation,
or for other special reasons, that truly we almost lose the
rule, in the attempt to turn it to any service. I judge it
therefore more useful, as well as safer, that any remarks of
this character should be introduced occasionally in the pro∣gress
of the work, and with reference to particulars which
suggest them; in which course, the true meaning and just li∣mits
of those maxims may more clearly be perceived, as
well as their truth or falsehood be more thoroughly tried,
than if they were only delivered in the abstract.</P>
<P>DECLINING,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> therefore, to make any excursion into these
regions, I shall begin, as a necessary introduction to the ana∣lysis
of the several offences, with an explanation of the nature
of that dole, that malicious and wilful purpose, which, ac∣cording
to all authorities, herein conformable to nature and
reason, is essential to the guilt of any crime. But in deli∣vering
<PB N="4" REF="61"/>
this general precept, those authorities are not to be
understood in that special and restrained sense, wherein the
term has often been taken and pleaded in criminal cases; as
if it were always necessary for the prosecutor, to bring evi∣dence
of an intent to do the very thing which has been
done, and to do it out of enmity to the individual who has
been injured. In this very favourable sense to the pannel,
the maxim cannot be received into the law; for it would
tend to screen many great offenders from punishment of their
transgressions. And I think it is only true in this looser and
more general, but practical and reasonable sense, in which
an English author<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Foster's Crown Law, p. 256. <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE> of the first judgment in those matters,
has explained it; that the act must be attended with such
circumstances, as indicate the corrupt and malignant dispo∣sition
of the offender, the heart contemptuous of order, and
regardless of social duty.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is not necessary for the prosecutor, to
bring evidence of a special purpose to injure the very per∣son
who has been the sufferer on the occasion. In a trial,
for instance, for the crime of fire-raising, it will not affect
the judgment of the Court, nor ought it of the Jury, that
the house which has been consumed is not the house of
his enemy, which the pannel meant to destroy, and to which
he applied the fire, but that of another person, to him un∣known,
and to which, by the shifting of the wind, or other
accident, the flames have been carried. The same is even
true in the case of homicide, that crime to which a special
malice might seem more natural and proper than any other.
For if John make a thrust at James, meaning to kill him,
and George, throwing himself between, receive the thrust,
and die, who doubts that John shall equally answer it, as if
<PB N="5" REF="62"/>
his mortal purpose had taken place upon James? Or if John
lay poison in such circumstances, as shew it to be intended
for a human creature, he shall certainly die for it, though
it be accidentally taken by the person who is dearest to him
upon earth, and whom, at the peril of his own life, he would
have redeemed from such a hazard. This was the opinion
of the Court, and never was doubted to be sound law, in
the case of Carnegie of Finhaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July and August 1728.</NOTE> who, hastily thrusting at
Lyon of Bridgeton, who had insulted him, happened to kill
another person, the Earl of Strathmore, to whom he bore
all manner of regard. And the same in some measure was
the description of the case of Matthew Hay, tried and con∣victed
of murder, at Ayr, in May 1780. The intention of
this man was to poison a young woman, who was with child
to him. She, however, though she ate of the food in which
the poison was mingled, survived the attempt, though injured
in her health; but her father and mother, who also ate of
it, were destroyed. Certainly the case was thus far more
unfavourable to him, that he could not but see the plain ha∣zard
to those who actually died, having thrown the poison
into the vessel, where the common mess was cooking for the
family.</P>
<P>IN the next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> it is not even indispensable, that the ma∣lice
be directed against any one in particular. For if a man
wickedly fire among a multitude at random, or if he ma∣liciously
turn out a mad dog into the street, at a time when
it is full of passengers, and a person is killed in consequence
of this brutality; surely any difference between such a case
of indiscriminate malice, and one of special hatred to an
individual, is all to the disadvantage of the offender, who
cannot be considered any otherwise than as a monster, or
<PB N="6" REF="63"/>
enemy of the human race, that ought not to he suffered
among men. A charge of this sort was brought against
James Niven, in March 1796, of whom the libel related,
that having loaded a small cannon with powder, and a
bit of iron, and having pointed it up a lane or street of
common passage, he there fired it off, at a time when two
persons were standing in the direction of the piece, and
others were passing along the lane; whereby one of the
persons first mentioned was killed. The circumstances of the
case gave no reason to presume, that the pannel was actuated
by special enmity to any of these persons, who were all un∣known
to him: Yet it was held upon the Bench, <HI>that if the
charge were proved, as laid,</HI> he was guilty of no lower crime
than murder. The Jury found a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it always necessary to conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> though it
is the ordinary and more frequent case, that there be evi∣dence
of a fixed intention on the part of the pannel, to do
the sort of mischief which in the event has happened. If
indeed the thing happen accidentally, and in the prosecu∣tion
also of some different and lawful act, from which the
pannel cannot reasonably have any dread of the harm that
ensues, this is exclusive of the notion of guilt: There is no
<HI>malus animus,</HI> no vice or corruption of purpose, to fix an evil
character on the deed. But if, on the contrary, the cir∣cumstances
indicate a wicked and malignant spirit, a reso∣lution
to do some violent and atrocious mischief, though
it go to a greater length than the pannel is absolutely
bent upon, or take a course somewhat different from that
which he intends, it is clear, that in many cases it will
be all one, as if he foresaw and intended the actual is∣sue.
If a man lie in wait for his neighbour, with intent
<PB N="7" REF="64"/>
to do him some grievous bodily harm, as for instance to
hamstring him, to cut out his tongue, or to give him an
outrageous beating, or the like, and the person is so abused
that he dies, either on the spot, or afterwards of the conse∣quences
of the injury, the law knows no difference between
this and the dole of murder. He hath actually killed, and
cannot be said not to have willed it, having willed that
which put his neighbour in plain hazard of his life, and
which shewed an utter indifference about the fate of his
neighbour, whether he were to live or die. Or again, if
one set fire to his neighbour's corn in the barn-yard, mean∣ing
to burn the corn, but the fire spreading catches the ad∣joining
dwelling-house, which is also consumed, and the
inhabitants within it, this is a clear ground, on which the
author of the calamity may as well be indicted for murder,
as for fire-raising.</P>
<P>IN these instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> the actual issue participates of the
nature of the original purpose, and the general malice
is followed by a mischief of that sort, which is natu∣rally
referrible to that same disposition and temper of
mind in the offender. But what shall be said, where the
will to do a certain unlawful act is accidentally follow∣ed
by a mischief, which is of a quite different kind and de∣gree?
In cases of this sort, according to certain of the
English authorities, the guilt of the first purpose is to be
considered, and the man to have judgment according to the
character in law of that which he intended to do: So that
if a person, shooting at a bird, happen unfortunately to
kill his neighbour, his sentence shall be different, according
to the kind of bird, and his purpose in shooting<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 258, 9. Keyling, 117.</NOTE>. If it be
<PB N="8" REF="65"/>
a tame fowl, which he shot at for amusement only, or for
his improvement as a marksman, it shall be manslaughter,
because of the unlawful purpose, of trespass on the property
of another. But if he shot with intention to steal and carry
off the fowl, which is a felony, it will be murder, by reason
of that intent: And again, if the homicide happen in shoot∣ing
at a wild pigeon, which is <HI>nullius in bonis,</HI> the person
shall be entirely excused. But I have found nothing in our
records, which inclines me to believe that our practice would
be disposed to take up a strained and artificial principle such
as this, by which things, in their own nature repugnant,
are conjoined, and the crime made out by coupling a pur∣pose
of lucre, to an act which is only then criminal, when it
comes of malice and a purpose to destroy; a disposition
which has neither actually been exerted, nor can reasonably
be inferred against the pannel, as one who might probably
be capable of such wickedness, if the occasion should hap∣pen.</P>
<P>If indeed the accident which ensues is a near consequence
and natural concomitant of the crime, which was meant
to be committed, this will alter the case. As thus: If a
person goes out armed, to rob on the highway, and he
attacks a passenger, who resists, and in the struggle his pistol
discharges, and the passenger is killed, this, without a doubt,
is murder. For not only is slaughter a near and probable
result of the purpose of violently robbing, (in so much, that
if the party should fall in the struggle, and break his neck,
even this might well be argued to be murder); but it hap∣pens
in this instance, in consequence of a preparation made
to kill; so that there is here an original malice and mis∣chievous
purpose against the person, suitable to the event,
<PB N="9" REF="66"/>
and whereof all the hazards must be with him, who has
acted on so atrocious a principle.</P>
<P>The like decision may seem to be right in another situa∣tion,
of which one instance was brought before the Court
of Justiciary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792. John Ker.</NOTE> though the prosecutor avoided to press it to a
judgment; as indeed it is a case of more difficulty than any
of those which have yet been put. I allude to the case of
a person who sets fire to his own house, being insured, and
inhabited by himself, meaning thereby to defraud the in∣surers;
if, in the progress of the flames, the house of his
neighbour also is destroyed. For though the main purpose
is a purpose of lucre to himself, yet neither can he in any
proper sense be said to be free of malice to his neighbour,
of whose plain danger, from the conflagration thus kind∣led,
he has shewn his extreme disregard. And indeed, if
the case be put somewhat more unfavourably for the pan∣nel,
as upon the supposition that the two houses are un∣der
one roof, or are floors of the same tenement, or are
otherwise so connected in the way of building, that the one
must be in very great risk by the burning of the other,
there seems to be little doubt of the decision which shall be
given.</P>
<P>I will, by way of illustration, put another case. If a mob
break into a house, meaning to destroy and pull it to pieces,
and in the bustle they accidentally set fire to the house,
which is consumed, there seems to be no good reason why
this may not be charged as fire-raising. Because the same
revengeful disposition is exerted, and the same injurious ob∣ject
is gained, in either mode of mischief; and thus the first
purpose is easily carried over to the event, without any sort
of doubtful or unwarrantable inference against the pannels.
<PB N="10" REF="67"/>
But if a thief breaks into a warehouse by night, to steal, and
is scared with noise, and hastily retires, leaving his light be∣hind
him, and thus the warehouse is burned, there is no
ground of inference from the motive of the thief, which
was for pure profit, without consideration of the person in∣jured,
who or what he was, to that harmful and vindictive
purpose, which is essential to the crime of fire-raising. At
most, therefore, the pannel, in such a case, could only be
liable to an arbitrary pain, as having done his neighbour
this great harm, in pursuance of an inchoated criminal act.
But I will not insist any farther in this inquiry: Especi∣ally
as I have little aid therein from the state of practice,
which does not afford any adjudged case towards elucida∣tion
of these rare and difficult questions; so that I have
only been stating my own sentiments, concerning that which
seems just and reasonable in itself.</P>
<P>THOUGH upon these articles there be great room for dif∣ference
of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> yet the practice of all countries is agreed
with respect to certain others, which also concern the state
of the offender's conscience. It is not material to the no∣tion
of guilt, (and indeed if there were no other reason for
it, the impossibility of searching into the heart and secret
thoughts would be a sufficient one,) that the offender have
himself had the full knowledge of the wrong and wicked∣ness
of the thing he did. Though he were persuaded that
it was innocent, or even meritorious, (as we know that by
fanaticism both in politics and in religion, men of worth
and ability have been moved to commit the foulest crimes,)
yet still it will not save him from the judgment of the law,
which must be determined by the nature of the act, and its
evil consequences to the public, and not by any regard to
<PB N="11" REF="68"/>
those miserable and strange delusions, which are as danger∣ous
as the vices of the most open malefactor. Whatsoever
be the cause which impels a person to the doing of those
things, which are destructive of the interest or the bonds
of society, his will is not on that account the less vicious,
or his nature the less depraved. It is only the greater proof
of his depravity, that he could do these things, without
even feeling that they were wrong.</P>
<P>AS little is it included in the notion of dole, that the
offender have been in the knowledge of the punishment
which law annexes to his crime. Nay, though he even
thought that it was a lawful act, and liable to no punish∣ment,
as in the case of plundering a wrecked vessel, or
rescuing his own goods seized by the revenue-officers, still he
shall not have a defence in this belief; for he may, and is
bound to know, as much of the law as relates to the regulation
of his own conduct, and shall be judged on the presumption
that he does so. And thus it is, that certain cases of homi∣cide
and other offences are explained, and reduced under the
common principle of dole, in which it may seem, at first
sight, that the person is punished for pure error, without a
criminal intention. The judge, for instance, who pronoun∣ces
a sentence of death, which is obviously unlawful, is not
adjudged guilty of murder because he has erred, but on the
footing of his having wilfully done wrong. The law, which
cannot know the truth of his excuse, and which perceives
the plain advantage that might be taken of such gross pre∣tences,
for the indulgence of malice, presumes his know∣ledge
of that which he is not excusable for being ignorant
of, and will judge him accordingly. As applied to this mat∣ter,
this seems to be the true meaning of that maxim, so of∣ten
mentioned in the Roman law, <HI>culpa lata equiparatur dolo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="69"/>
AFTER this of the nature of dole, or criminal intention,
we naturally pass to an enquiry concerning the persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may com∣mit Crimes.</NOTE> who
are or are not capable of contracting this sort of guilt. For
in truth, as Blackstone hath observed, all the pleas and ex∣cuses
which serve to protect any one from those pains, which
law has otherwise appointed for his offence, may be re∣duced
to the one consideration of the defect, either abso∣lute
or in a certain degree, of that dole, that vicious will
or depraved disposition, of which we have now been treat∣ing.</P>
<P>I. WE shall first attend to the case of minors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Minors.</NOTE> or persons
under age, who are from that cause deficient in intelligence,
and in firmness also or maturity of will. As this is not,
however, equally true of all minors, but is various accord∣ing
to the several degrees of non-age, and is even very dif∣ferent
in persons of the same years, so the law of most coun∣tries
has qualified its rules on this head, and made more than
one distinction.</P>
<P>HOW this matter was arranged for the several periods of
life by the Roman law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of Rome, and of England.</NOTE> is not any where very expressly or
fully delivered; though, upon the several loose and scatter∣ed
testimonies<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Dig. lib. 50. tit. 17. l. 111.; lib. 47. tit. 2. l. 23.; lib. 44. tit. 4. l. 4. No. 26.; lib. 47. tit. 12. l. 3. No. 1.</NOTE>, relative to the different crimes, it rather
appears, that even upon a person under the age of fourteen,
if <HI>pubertati proximus,</HI> and found to be <HI>doli capax,</HI> some punish∣ment
might be inflicted, but lighter than in the case of a
minor <HI>pubes.</HI> But in the law of the neighbouring kingdom,
the following, not unreasonable rules, seem to be received:
<PB N="13" REF="70"/>
1. With respect to persons either male or female, of four∣teen
years of age, that capacity of dole is to be presumed,
and the ordinary judgment to be pronounced upon them,
though it be even judgment of death. 2. With respect to
those who are under fourteen, and still more decidedly with
respect to those who are under twelve years of age, the pre∣sumption
is the other way, but still not to the exclusion of
evidence to the contrary; which, if it be obtained, and be
pregnant, and if, instead of delaying judgment, (that the
King's pleasure concerning a pardon may be known), the
Court chuses to proceed, it shall be judgment for the ordi∣nary
pains, whatsoever these are, of the offence. 3. In the
case of mere infants, or persons under seven years of age,
the presumption of freedom from dole is absolute, and does
not allow a conviction to be obtained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 25. <HI>et seq.</HI> Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOUCHING our municipal practice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minors, if pu∣nishable capital∣ly in Scotland.</NOTE> I know not whether
it can be affirmed, that it has yet, in all these articles, at∣tained
to the same degree of maturity and precision as that
of England. This, however, seems to be certain, that with
respect to minors, if they have reached the age of puberty,
which in this question will be fixed at fourteen for females
as well as males, they are liable to the ordinary judgment,
not excepting that of death, for those crimes, such as mur∣der,
fire-raising, theft, and the like, whereof the wickedness
may be known to them, even at that early period of life.</P>
<P>Mackenzie has indeed delivered his own opinion, that a
<HI>minor,</HI> (for he uses no other term), shall not in any case be
liable to the ordinary pain, not even for crimes against the
law of nature, such as murder<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. of Crimes, No. 5.</NOTE>: Nay, he even seems to
<PB N="14" REF="71"/>
think it reasonable, though he does not affirm this to be law,
that for any crime done in minority, the offender should not
be obliged to answer till he be major. But it is obvious,
that so wide a scheme of indulgence, which would exempt
that season of life when men are most adventurous and in∣ventive,
and most liable also to the seduction of evil ex∣ample,
not only would not be salutary, but in the end would
prove to be the reverse of merciful or humane. And in
truth, though our records afford us many instances of such a
plea maintained for a minor pannel, and some of a lighter pu∣nishment
inflicted on him, after advising with the King or Pri∣vy
Council<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Thus, on the 5th April 1636, on the conviction of John Macilconnell, a boy of fifteen, as present with the Macgrigors at their robberies and depredations, the Justice, <HI>at the intercession of the assize,</HI> supersedes doom, until he advise with the Privy Council. According to a marking on the margin of the register, he seems in the end to have been banished. But the manner of the proceeding shews, that the Justice held this lenity to be out of the ordinary course, and be∣yond his own powers.</NOTE>, (as certainly nonage is always one ground of a
claim of mercy, and may have its weight along with others);
yet still this lenity never grew into a rule: On the contra∣ry,
it was always an extraordinary matter, and whensoever
the proper occasion came, the minor convict, equally as any
other, underwent the highest severity of the law. Thus, on
the 27th July 1636, upon the conviction of Allaster and Cal∣lum
Forbes, as art and part with Patrick Macgrigor <HI>alias</HI>
Gilroy, and others, in their herships and depredations, the
Justice, in respect of their minority and their ingenuous con∣fession,
supersedes to give doom, until he know the pleasure of
the Privy Council. On the 29th July, after consulting with
<PB N="15" REF="72"/>
that body, he adjudges them to be executed along with their
older and more practised associates<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The verdict says, “And as concerning the punishment to be inflicted on Allaster and Callum Forbes, for the forenamed crimes, for the whilk they are convict, in respect of thair confession, remittis thair punishment to the Justice to consider of thair minority.”</P>
<P>“The Lords of Secret Council ordainis and commandis his Majestie's Justice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pronounce doom and sentence against Allaster and Callum Forbes, and Gillespie Macfarlane, quhais dome was continuit be thaime, while they con∣sultit the said Lordis thairanent; ordaining them to be hangit to the death, and for that end to be drawn backwards to the place of execution, the morne, in the afternoon, along with the rest of James Grant and Gilroy's com∣plices.”</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In like manner, on the 26th August 1612, James Middle∣ton,
indicted for slaughter, pleads that he was only fifteen
at the time libelled. The pursuer avers that he was then se∣venteen.
The Justice <HI>finds</HI> process, and on conviction, he
has sentence of death<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">He lay six years in goal, and on the 18th November 1618, was allowed to go into banishment.</NOTE>. The trial of William Jameson is a
third instance of the same tendency.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 16. 1632.</NOTE> This pannel was in∣dicted
for murder, and the Justice, in respect of a testimo∣nial
from the parish of his birth, “beirand the pannell to
be past saxtene years of age;” repels his plea of non-age,
and sends the charge to an assize. But he had a verdict in
his favour. Again;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 21. 1634.</NOTE> in the case of Robert Forrester, who is
pannelled along with his father for forgery, and alleges that
he was not more than fourteen years old at the date of the
fact libelled, the charge is nevertheless sent to an assize;
<PB N="16" REF="73"/>
who indeed acquit him, but on a separate ground<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Robert Forrester alleges, “That the said Robert, the time of the alledgit counterfeiting of the said alledgit testimonial of the subscriptions thereof, was nocht of the age of fourtene years, at least had nocht past that age, and sae was not <HI>doli capax.</HI>” The pursuer answers, “That he may be <HI>fraudis capax,</HI> gif he be but twelf years of age, at the least fourtene, being past pupilla∣rity; and the pannell's assertion ought nocht to be respectit, because nocht ve∣rifyit nor proven; likeas, as the pursuer alledges that he was past seventene years of age the tyme of the writing.”</P>
<P>“The Justice repells the alledgiances above written, and nochtwithstanding thereof, refers the dittay to the knowledge of ane assize.”</P></NOTE>. Far∣ther,
this matter underwent a debate in the case of the Vis∣count
of Frendraught, accused of the murder of Gregory of
Netherdale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4. 1664.</NOTE> and of imprisoning a free liege; and in that
instance also, the issue was, that the defences were repelled,
and the case remitted to the knowledge of an assize<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Ordains the Viscount of Frendraught to pass to the knowledge of an assize, notwithstanding the defence for the crime of murder, incarcerating and detaining ane free liege, and for art and part of these crimes.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN later times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minors, if pu∣nishable capital∣ly.</NOTE> the same practice has without hesitation
been followed. Thus, on the 14th March 1786, Walter
Ross, for pocket-picking; on the 20th June 1786, John
Johnston for the same crime; and on the 14th February
1785, Archibald Stewart, for two acts of house-breaking;
had all of them sentence of death, being lads of about
eighteen years old. Also, on the 23d June 1791, Stewart,
Paul and Bannatyne were condemned to die, for robbery;
one of whom was not above eighteen. For the like crime,
James Mackenzie, at the age of seventeen, had sentence of
death at Glasgow, on the 11th April 1793. But a much
stronger example than any of these, and indeed such as
<PB N="17" REF="74"/>
makes it unnecessary to carry our reseaches farther, is the
case of Samuel Pirrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 20. &amp; 21. 1786.</NOTE> post-boy, tried at Ayr, for abstract∣ing
a packet from the mail, containing the sum of L. 18,
which he conveyed to his mother-in-law, Jean Fitchie, who
appears to have seduced him to the crime. The verdict is
thus: “Find the pannel Samuel Pirrie guilty of the theft
as libelled; but in respect of his tender age, being under,
or little above fourteen years, his apparent weakness of
understanding, his open and candid confession, and that
it appears by the evidence that he committed the crime
at the instigation, and for the benefit of his stepmother,
Jean Fitchie; they beg leave humbly to recommend him
to the royal mercy.” Yet even in these circumstances,
which are an assemblage of all the considerations which in
any case can serve to extenuate guilt, did the Judge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Then Lord Braxfield, now Lord Justice-Clerk.</NOTE> think
it his duty to pronounce sentence of death upon the pannel,
leaving the intercession of the jury to have its due influence
upon the royal breast, where it accordingly had the desired
effect, of procuring a pardon to this weak and misguided
youth.</P>
<P>WITH respect again to capital crimes of a statutory and
instituted nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How punishable for statutory Crimes.</NOTE> such as hearing of mass, striking in pre∣sence
of the Court of Session, and the like, it may seem
to be more doubtful, whether there be not room for a
distinction in favour of those minors, who are nearer the
years of puberty than majority. And here an argument
may be grounded on the statute 1661, c. 20. concerning the
cursing and beating of parents, both in favour of such an
indulgence, as a reasonable thing in itself, and for fixing on
the age of sixteen years, as that at which the minor shall
<PB N="18" REF="75"/>
become liable to death, for offences of this description.
For so it is appointed by that ordinance, with respect to the
transgressions there vindicated, which, though known to
every child as high immoralities, and deserving of the most
severe domestic correction, yet as objects of public trial,
and of sentence of death, are rather the creatures of the
law, and cannot justly be imputed, to any one, who has not
attained to maturity of judgment and discretion.</P>
<P>IN regard to persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pupils, if pu∣nishable capital∣ly.</NOTE> whether male or female, under the age
of fourteen years, whether they in any case are liable to be
capitally punished, I shall rather content myself with stating
such testimonies as I have found in the record, which have
relation to this matter, than attempt to infer a rule from
such scanty and imperfect materials.</P>
<P>On the 21st October 1564, William Elliot of Horsliehill,
and five others, are pannelled, for the murder of Scott of
Hassinden. One is repledged; four are convicted and be∣headed;
and with respect to the sixth pannel, Archibald
Elliot, who is marked <HI>puer</HI> on the margin of the record, op∣posite
to his name, he is <HI>dismissed,</HI> without trial. On the 6th
of August 1605, William Maxwell, indicted along with his fa∣ther
Archibald, for slaughter, and for shooting with hagbuts,
is sent to an assize, notwithstanding his plea of pupillarity.
The Justice, however, at the same time, “remits to the
assize to take cognizance of his age, if they think expe∣dient.”
The assize find him guilty “of shooting with hag∣buts,
within a spear's length of his father's house, and
that he was then within fourteen years of age.” It does
not appear that any sentence followed upon this conviction.</P>
<P>IN March 1701,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pupils, if pu∣nishable capital∣ly.</NOTE> Duff and Millar, the first a boy of four∣teen
years, the other about twelve, are indicted, along with
<PB N="19" REF="76"/>
Fraser and Anderson, two grown men, for breaking into the
Earl of Home's house at Hirsel, and stealing a quantity of
plate. The libel, as to the two boys, is found only rele∣vant
to infer an arbitrary pain, and to infer death against
the other pannels. On conviction, Fraser is condemned to
die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. &amp; 10. 1701.</NOTE> and Duff and Millar to be scourged at the gibbet, at
the time of his execution, and Duff to stand for an hour,
with an ear nailed to the gibbet, in presence of Millar. The
next in date to this is the noted case in 1749,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin's Ca∣ses, No 55.</NOTE> of Alexander
Livingston, a boy of twelve years old, and found by the
jury to be <HI>doli capax,</HI> and guilty of killing another boy, by
stabbing him with a knife: and here the Court gave judg∣ment
of transportation. Last of all, John Brand, a boy of
thirteen years and eight months old, was brought to trial at
Perth, for stealing letters from the post-office, which he had
accomplished by an ingenious device of his own contri∣vance.
The Judges on the circuit thought the case proper
for the consideration of all their brethren. But the boy peti∣tioned
for banishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 30. 1789.</NOTE> and the prosecutor thought it proper
to consent.</P>
<P>Such as these precedents are, they are all upon the side of
mercy. Yet I shall not affirm that they are such, as to make
an absolute rule for all cases of crime committed in pupilla∣rity,
without regard to the atrocious wickedness, the incor∣rigible
obstinacy, or malicious cunning, of the offender, fully
revealed in that of which he is convicted. Put the case
of repeated fire-raising, or of the murder of a parent, or
of the murder of any person by poison, committed by
a boy of twelve or thirteen years of age: I hesitate to
say, for any authority I have seen, that the law will ex∣tend
its mercy to these situations of extreme and hopeless
depravity.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="77"/>
If, by any future judgment, it shall be found that a pupil
has no absolute exemption from this last and highest atone∣ment
for his crime, probably this discretion of the Court
will, however, at least be subject to a limitation, with respect
to that period of life, between seven and ten and a half years,
and in the civil law termed <HI>infantiae proxima,</HI> which can
hardly be supposed to receive the full and capital degree of
dole. On the 13th November 1493, in a Court held at Lau∣der,
Thomas Gothraston, a boy of eight years old, charged
with the murder of John Smith, is ordered to be sharply
scourged, “<HI>ad effusionem sanguinis,</HI>” on a holiday, at the
church of the parish of Legertwood, within which he had
done the deed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Maclaurin, p. 747.</NOTE>. In the case of Maxwell against Armstrongs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11. 1605.</NOTE>
for burning of corns, an objection is moved for certain of
the pannels, who allege that they were only eight years
of age at the time libelled. The result seems to be, that
they are passed from on finding caution to keep the peace<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I say <HI>seems</HI> to be, because the record is confused and difficult to be read.</NOTE>.

to the lesser pains, a more certain language may war∣rantably
be used. It is not by any authority maintained, that
a mere infant, one who is under seven years old, is in any
case liable to any manner of pain. On the other side, it is
as little to be doubted, that for all crimes of such a kind,
whereof the wickedness can be supposed to be known to them,
<PB N="21" REF="78"/>
and committed in circumstances of freedom, (for this seems
to be a necessary condition of the rule), all who are above
that age, and proved to be capable of dole, are liable to such
mitigated pains as shall be adequate, in the opinion of the
Court, to the ends of correction and example. In evidence
of this, it may be sufficient to refer to two instances, in ad∣dition
to those which have incidentally been mentioned.
One is the case of Charles and Donald Robertson, two boys
under fourteen<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As to both the sons, it is particularly pleaded, that they were not four∣teen, and so not punishable, and cannot pass to the knowledge of ane assize.” This is a passage of Sir G. Mackenzie's pleading for them, as in the record. The printed pleading, in the edition of Sir George's works, makes them fifteen.</NOTE>, (as was alleged), indicted along with their
father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6, &amp; 9. 1671.</NOTE> for the casting down of certain houses, at his com∣mand,
and carrying off the materials to which he pretended
right. This charge was, upon full debate, found relevant
against them, and remitted to an assize; but a conviction
was not obtained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27, &amp; 28. 1726.</NOTE> The other is the case of Ludovick More,
Andrew Duncan and James Robertson. The charge here
was for shop breaking, and Robertson pled, that at the date
of the fact, which was nearly a year before the trial, he
was a pupil and <HI>doli in capax,</HI> as would be evident to the
Court, <HI>ex habitu vultus et corporis.</HI> But of this plea no notice
was taken in the interlocutor; and being convicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 3. 1726.</NOTE> he had
judgment of transportation along with the other pannels.</P>
<P>In like manner, upon libel for high crimes raised against
either a minor or a pupil, and followed with petition on his
part for banishment or other arbitrary pain, it has always
been the practice that judgment passes to that effect; nor
will the person be reponed against a sentence of this sort,
under pretence of his minority, without proof of some gross
irregularity or substantial injustice in the proceedings. It
<PB N="22" REF="79"/>
has been mentioned, that John Brand, a boy under four∣teen,
was banished in this way. Andrew Maclaren, a boy
of sixteen, charged with house-breaking, had also been ba∣nished
Scotland in this form, by sentence of a Sheriff-court.
On 22d December 1783, he complained of this by suspen∣sion,
laid on the ground of his minority, the want of advice
on the occasion, and certain objections to the libel and way
of proceeding. But the Court of Justiciary were of opinion,
that there was no ground of relief, and refused the bill.</P>
<P>Before dismissing this article, I shall only farther observe,
that in fixing the measure of punishment which shall be in∣flicted
on a pupil, the Court are not, cannot be confined to
dispense it, according to years and days, but take into con∣sideration
all the circumstances, the equity of the case, and
proportion their sentence to the character of the particular
deed; so as humanity may be consulted whensoever it can,
and the ends of public example be answered, when occasion
shall require it. In this view, regard is not only to be had
to the rank of the crime in the abstract, but also to the con∣trivance
and way of execution of the particular deed; to the
degree of concern which the pupil had in it, whether it was
as principal actor, or only in the way of remote and infe∣rior
assistance; to the circumstance of his doing it single or
with accomplices; and if with assistance, whether it was
that of others of his own age, or of old and trained offen∣ders,
or perhaps of such who stood in a situation of awe and
authority over him, and might constrain him to the adven∣ture
against his will.</P>
<P>II. NEXT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Plea of Insanity.</NOTE> after minors, we may attend to the case of those
unfortunate persons, who have to plead the more miserable
defence of idiotry or madness, which, if it is not pretended,
<PB N="23" REF="80"/>
but genuine, and is withal of the due degree, and is fully
proved, brings the act to be the same as that of an infant,
and has equally the privilege in all cases of an entire ex∣emption
from any manner of pain; “<HI>Cum alterum inno∣centia
concilii tuetur, alterum fati infelicitas excusat</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 12. ad Legem Corneliam de Sicariis.</NOTE>”. I
say, where it is fully proved, and is of the due degree:
For if reason and humanity enforce the plea in these cir∣cumstances,
it is no less necessary to observe such a caution
and temperament in the application of it, as shall hinder it
to be understood, that there is any privilege of mere weak∣ness
of intellect, or of a strange and moody humour, or of
a crazy and capricious, or irregular temper and habit.
None of these things either are or ought to be law. Because
such constitutions are neither exclusive of a competent un∣derstanding
of the true state of the circumstances in which
the deed is done, nor of the subsistance of some steady evil
passion, grounded in that situation, and directed to a certain
object. To serve the purpose, therefore, of an excuse in
law, the disorder must amount to absolute alienation of rea∣son,
“<HI>ut continua mentis alienatione, omni intellectu careat,</HI>”
such a disease which deprives the patient of the know∣ledge
of the true position of things about him, and of the
discernment of friend from foe, and gives him up to the im∣pulse
of his own distempered fancy, divested of all self-go∣vernment,
or controul of his passions.</P>
<P>WHETHER it should be added to the description,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Plea of Insanity.</NOTE> that he
must have lost all knowledge of good and evil, right and
wrong, this is a more delicate question, and fit perhaps to
be resolved differently, according to the sense in which it is
understood. If it be put in this sense, in a case, for in∣stance,
<PB N="24" REF="81"/>
of murder, Did the pannel know that murder was a
crime? Would he have answered on the question, that it
was wrong to kill a neighbour? this is hardly to be reputed
a just criterion of such a state of soundness, as ought to
make a man accountable in law for his actions. Because it
may happen a person to answer in this way, who yet is so
absolutely mad, as to have lost all true observation of facts,
all understanding of the good or evil intentions of those
who are about him, or even the knowledge of their persons.
But if the question be put in this other and more special
sense, as relative to the very act done by the pannel, and
the particular situation in which at that time he conceived
himself to stand, Did he, as at the moment of doing <HI>that
thing,</HI> understand the evil of it? Was he impressed with the
consciousness of guilt, and fear of punishment?—it is then
a pertinent and material question, but which cannot to any
substantial purpose be answered, without taking into conside∣ration
the whole circumstances of the situation. Every judg∣ment
in the matter of right and wrong supposes a case, or
state of facts, to which it applies. And though the pannel
have that vestige of reason, which may enable him to an∣swer
in the general, that murder is a crime, yet if he cannot
dististinguish his friend from his enemy, but conceive eve∣ry
thing about him to be the reverse of what it really is,
and mistake the illusions of his fancy for realities, with re∣spect
to his own condition, and that of others, “<HI>absurda et
tristia sibi dicens atque fingens,</HI>” these remains of intellect
are thus of no use to him towards the government of his
actions, nor in anywise enable him to form a judgment up∣on
any particular situation or conjuncture, of what is right
or wrong with regard to it. If he does not know the per∣son
of his friend or neighbour, or though he do know him,
<PB N="25" REF="82"/>
if he is possessed with the vain conceit that he is come there
to destroy him, or that he has already done him the most
cruel injuries, and that all about him are engaged in one
soul conspiracy to abuse him, as well might he be utterly
ignorant of the quality of murder. Proceeding, as it does,
on a false case, or conjuration of his own fancy, his judg∣ment
of right and wrong, as to any responsibility that should
attend it, is truly the same as none at all. It is therefore
only in this complex and appropriated sense, as relative to the
particular thing done, and the situation of the pannel's feel∣ings
and consciousness on that occasion, that this inquiry
concerning his intelligence of moral good or evil is mate∣rial,
and not in any other or larger sense.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the point whence I set out.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Insaui∣ty.</NOTE> Our practice
has always been governed by the general precept, already
mentioned, which admits of no defence, short of absolute
alienation of reason. To that purpose, the interlocutor up∣on
the case of Robert Thomson, indicted for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1739.</NOTE> finds it
relevant, and allows him to prove, “That when the fact
libelled was committed, he was so furious, mad and di∣stracted,
<HI>as to be totally deprived of his reason and under∣standing;</HI>
reserving consideration as to the effect of what
should be found proven, until the verdict should be re∣turned.”</P>
<P>THE same principle had governed in the conviction of
Thomas Gray. This man was indicted for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26, 27. 1773.</NOTE> by stab∣bing.
It was alleged for him, that he was of very weak
intellect, extremely passionate and flighty, addicted to the
immoderate drinking of strong liquors, and, on the whole,
what between the use of these and natural infirmity, rather
a sort of fool or crazy person, and so considered by his
<PB N="26" REF="83"/>
neighbours, than a sound man. This account was confirmed
by the witnesses upon the trial, several of whom swore to his
being drunk when he stabbed, and that he was at all times
a weak and passionate creature, and especially (as they ex∣pressed
it) “on the woodish order when he got drunk.” All
this was plainly short of madness in the sense of law, and
the jury therefore found him <HI>guilty</HI> of the murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was pleaded for this man, at recording the verdict, that he was <HI>then</HI> in∣sane, and that sentence could not pass upon him. The diet was continued; and the case appears to have dropped out of the record.</NOTE>. The rule is farther confirmed by the case of Robert Bonthorn.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 29. and Dec. 12. 1763.</NOTE>
The charge against him was, that being a smuggler, and ha∣ving
had contraband goods seized in his possession, he, out
of revenge, laid hold of an opportunity violently to push the
revenue-officer over a precipice upon the sea-shore, whereby
the man had his thigh-bone broken, and was otherwise in∣jured.
The jury “find the libel proven, and also find, that
the intellects of the pannel are most remarkably weak,
irregular and confused, and therefore recommend him to
the mercy of the Court.” He had judgment, neverthe∣less,
to be twice whipped at different places of the county
where he dwelt, and for a sum of damages and expences.</P>
<P>FOR the same reasons which weighed in these cases, the
defence of madness is less suspected, and will more easily
be received, against a charge of murder, mutilation, or other
violent crime, than of those offences, like theft or forgery,
which can hardly be executed without art and steadiness of
purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22. and Mar. 9. 1731.</NOTE> I find that in the trial of Thomas Henderson, for
horse-stealing, it was pleaded for him, that he was subject to
occasional fits of madness. But the libel charged, that he
had conducted himself prudently in the adventure, having
stolen the horse in the night, and ridden straightway by an
<PB N="27" REF="84"/>
unfrequented road to a distance, where he left the horse,
under a plausible pretence, and, last of all, sold it, and took
a bill for the price. The interlocutor therefore did not take
notice of this allegation, but repelled in general all the
pannel's defences.</P>
<P>BUT although the distemper must thus be absolute in de∣gree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Insani∣ty be constant.</NOTE>
it is not material that it be also total in respect of
time. The quality of the action has no dependence but
upon the pannel's state of mind at the time of doing it; so
that whether his malady be constant and unremitting, or
only return at intervals, still the defence will be equally
available, if he was then utterly furious, and void of reason.
And here I may cite the case of Sir Archibald Kinloch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1795.</NOTE>
which was that of a person, who, having had his senses in∣jured
by the acute delirium of a West India fever, was
afterwards liable to occasional fits of derangement, though
at considerable intervals, and at length, in a state of utter
furiosity, had the misfortune to kill his brother. The vio∣lence
of this fit had only been for a few days before the
fact, and he soon after settled into his ordinary condition.
Nevertheless, the jury were unanimous to acquit him.</P>
<P>THE case of Robert Spence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Insani∣ty at Intervals.</NOTE> also tried for murder, was in
some measure of the same description. The pannel, and the
deceased, who was a woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. &amp; 30. 1747.</NOTE> and teacher of a school, were
inhabitants of different floors in the same building. And
it apears, that having risen in his shirt, in the dusk of the
evening, and knocked at her door, he, upon opening, instant∣ly
rushed in, and uttering some strange and incoherent ex∣clamations
against the woman, knocked her on the head
<PB N="28" REF="85"/>
with a hatchet, or chopping knife, which he brought with
him. After dispatching her, he ran off to his own house, and
when a <HI>posse</HI> assembled to seize him, he suddenly sprung out
upon them, and attempted to escape. It was also a remark∣able
circumstance, that on returning to his house, he had
taken offence at a wig-block which stood there, and violently
clove it down with the same hatchet; so that it was found
all besmeared with the woman's brains and gore. With re∣gard
to his symptoms of disorder for some days preceding,
they were chiefly these; a great degree of restlessness, a
disposition to ramble through the country at all hours and
without an object, incoherent discourse, and disorderly be∣haviour,
though without any act of outrage or violence of∣fered
to his neighbour. But it was farther proved, that
some years before, when employed as a sailor, he had oc∣casionally
shown symptoms of derangement, which were
aggravated by drinking, so that he had sometimes been con∣sined
on board of ship, for eight or ten successive days, as
insane. The jury found it “proven, that the pannel was
furious at the time he committed the said murder, but
to what degree of furiosity, they could not determine.”
On which verdict, the Court ordered him into confinement,
until bail should be found by his relations, to keep him in
a state of safety.</P>
<P>THERE is one case more of the same character upon re∣cord;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1781.</NOTE>
that of Jean Blair, who, with a hatchet, cruelly
mangled and killed her mistress, with whom she had li∣ved
some years, as a confidential servant, and then, after
setting fire to the house, and defacing the effects with∣in
it, ran out stark naked, and with her hands bloody, into
the street, and gave the alarm of fire to the guard. It was
proved that several of her family had been insane, and that
<PB N="29" REF="86"/>
she herself had shewn symptoms of insanity about ten years
before. She was acquitted of the murder; but was ordered
into confinement.</P>
<P>I AM not sure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Insanity at Intervals.</NOTE> whether I ought to refer to the same, or
to another class, the case, already mentioned, of Robert
Thomson, which was tried in June 1739. It was, in all its
circumstances, an extraordinary case. The pannel was ac∣cused
of the murder of George Forrester, committed at mid∣day,
in the muir of Ballencrieff, and on the highway from
Haddington to Aberlady, by knocking him down from his
horse with a stone, and cutting his throat with a pen-knife,
as he lay on the ground. The pannel was a blacksmith,
and had been employed in his trade as usual, that very
morning, till ten o'clock. And farther, not more than half
an hour before the murder, two persons, who met him on
the highway, had spoken to him in passing, and without
observing any thing unusual in his appearance. A few hours
after committing the murder, he was taken into custody,
and in the afternoon of the same day, and in the course of
conveyance to goal, he had so far recovered as to be sen∣sible
of what he had done. He pointed out the precise spot
where he had killed the deceased; showed “the inno∣cent
blood” (as he called it) on the ground; said, that
his own blood would be shed for it; and expressed con∣cern
on account of the distress which he would bring upon
his father. He also related to the persons who had charge
of him upon the way, that the deceased had many times
cried for mercy, while he was striking him on the ground;
but, “I trow (said he) I had no mercy on him, for I be∣lieved
it was the devil that I killed.” In the same strain
he added, that before meeting the deceased, he had chased
<PB N="30" REF="87"/>
the devil through the muir in another shape, “like a man
with a whin-cow in his hat,” and who suddenly vanished
from before him in the pursuit. In confirmation of these
strange circumstances, it was proved, that the pannel was
subject to convulsion fits, especially at full moon, and that
he was melancholy after them, and liable to be troubled
with religious horrors, so that he sometimes started from his
bed in the night, and spoke and acted as if he were grap∣pling
with the devil. He had been seized with one of
these fits a few days before the murder, but it had not
been followed with any extraordinary depression of spirits.
The jury returned a verdict finding “no proof of furiosity
“till after the murder was committed;” as indeed no one
was present to judge of his appearance at that time, and re∣cently
before he had been in his ordinary condition. Yet
upon the whole circumstances there was little room to be∣lieve
him guilty; and in this light the case had been viewed
elsewhere; for he received a transportation-pardon.</P>
<P>WHAT is still more strange than any malady of this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of sudden Phrensy.</NOTE>
there have even been instances of sudden, and in a great
measure unaccountable phrensy, and which, though excessive
for the time, quickly subsided, and never again returned.
And in these too, the plea of insanity has been sustained.
A history of this sort is related by Sir M. Hale; that of a
woman who was tried at Aylesbury in 1668, for the murder
of her own child. She was a married woman, and of un∣doubted
good fame and virtuous deportment. But not ha∣ving
slept for some nights after her delivery, and by this and
other disorder of her person, having fallen into a sort of deli∣rium,
and being left alone, she killed her infant; which,
presently after, she showed to some persons who came in,
<PB N="31" REF="88"/>
and told them she had done it. She was instantly carried
to goal, where, in a little, she fell into a deep sleep, and on
awaking, was found to have recovered her senses, and mar∣velled
much, how, or on what account she had come there.
The jury very justly found her not guilty of the murder.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>VERY like this, though the verdict was different, was our
case of Agnes Crockat, of the 23d July 1756. This woman
also had killed her own child. She was an unmarried wo∣man,
but had called help to her delivery, and had openly
kept and suckled the child for the space of six or seven days.
It was sworn to, that at times, upon the day of the fact,
she had been strange in her speech and behaviour, but to
which the witnesses had not paid much regard; and being
left alone with her child, she laid hand upon and strangled
it. She kept it, however, lying openly by her in the bed,
till the people of the house returned, and then she showed
it them, and told them what she had done, and said, “that
the devil had tempted her.” The case was thus far weak∣er
than the former, that there was no clear proof of bodi∣ly
complaint, or of a marked transition from a state of dis∣order
to soundness. The jury therefore found her guilty.
But the royal mercy interposed to prevent her execution.</P>
<P>A THIRD case of the like character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of sudden Phrensy.</NOTE> was tried at Jedburgh,
in April 1785, and issued in a verdict of acquittal. The
pannel was a man named Robert Coalston, a husbandman or
farm-servant. Some years before the fact, he had been
struck with lightening, and from that time had occasionally
been subject to melancholy and depression of spirits, but not
in any remarkable degree, nor such as hindered him to do
his business as a servant, and without any sort of tendency
<PB N="32" REF="89"/>
to violence or mischief. But of a sudden, and without any
new or visible cause, the man became restless and impatient,
and having left his master's house, in the middle of the
night, set a roaming through the country, without plan or
object, and behaving absurdly, as he went along, but still
without offering violence to any whom he met. In the e∣vening
of the next day, he returned to his master's house;
and by this time, having waxed outrageous, he abused his
fellow-servants; assaulted and struck his mistress; and ha∣ving
suddenly snatched an infant out of her arms, which
she had upon the breast, he ran off with it, out of the
house. A few minutes after, the child and he were found to∣gether
in an outhouse, the child dead, and dashed to pieces,
and the man sitting quietly by it, as quite unconscious of
what had passed. He made no attempt to fly or resist, and was
carried to goal, where he soon settled into a state of lan∣guor
and stupefaction; out of which when he recovered,
in the course of a few days, he seemed to have no remem∣brance
of these incidents, and suffered great agitation, on
being told what he had done<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">These circumstances do not appear on the record; but are known to me, as counsel for the pannel.</NOTE>. The jury found the slaugh∣ter
proved, but the insanity also proved; and he was or∣dered
into confinement. In short, how unaccountable soever
to us, these visitations of sudden and temporary madness,
yet still they are within the compass of this miserable privi∣lege,
if the utter alienation of reason for the time be proved.</P>
<P>BESIDE those, of which an account has incidentally been
given, I have found but one instance more of the plea
of furiosity sustained, in which there is any thing worthy
to be remarked; the case of James Sommerville, tried in
<PB N="33" REF="90"/>
1704. This man was one of the town-officers of Edin∣burgh,
and had shot a soldier of the town-guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20, &amp; 27. Dec. 5. &amp; 8.</NOTE> one of a
party which had been sent to seize him, on his becoming
outrageous. These were the chief circumstances alleged
in evidence of his insanity: 1. That three or four months
before the deed, the magistrates of the city, having obser∣ved
indications of derangement, had ordered him to keep
at home, and appointed him a weekly allowance during his
confinement. 2. He had conceived a jealousy of evil in∣tended
him, and had applied to the Provost for a safe con∣duct
or protection, which was given him, out of indulgence
to his humour. 3. About four months before the slaughter,
he had called for a sword to kill his brother, who came to
visit him. 4. He became slovenly in his person and appa∣rel,
instead of careful as formerly, and walked out into the
street with his stockings loose about his heels. 5. He ut∣tered
strange and hideous cries in church, and in time of di∣vine
service. 6. On the morning of the day libelled, he
ran into the street in his shirt, with a drawn sword, and
threatened his neighbours. 7. On being committed after
the fact, and desired to give up his officer's coat or uniform,
he was scurrilous to the magistrate, and desired him “to go
hang himself and his coat.” 8. After commitment, he was
so disorderly, that it was necessary to confine him in the
iron cage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 27. 1704.</NOTE> The Court “sustained the defence of his being
mad, relevant to assoilzie him from the ordinary pain,
the pannel proving that the same morning the defunct was
slain, he went through the wynd in his shirt, with a drawn
sword in his hand, threatening his neighbours, and any
other <HI>two</HI> of the qualifications of fury condescended on,
except the <HI>fourth,</HI> on which the Lords lay no stress.” The
<PB N="34" REF="91"/>
jury returned a special and aukward verdict<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The jury “Find it proven, 1. That there was an warrand or order given by Baillie Warrander to go to the pannell, and endeavour by all fair means, to bring him with the said Baillie. 2. We find it proven, That the pannell threat∣ned the persons that desired him to open the door, and go to the said Baillie. 3. We find it proven, That the time they were breaking up the door, Hen∣derson, the defunct, received a shot throw the lock-hole of the door, which gave him several wounds in his body, and that he dyed about twenty days thereafter. 4. We find it proven, That when the pannell opened the door af∣ter the shot, he asked How all was? and he was told be Ferguson, Smith and Innes, that he had killed a man; to which he made answer, God have mercy upon my soul. 5. We find it proven, That some months before the fact, the pannell had acted like a furious or madman. 6. We find it proven, That af∣ter the fact was committed, the pannell gave Baillie Warrander scurrilous lan∣guage; and, <HI>lastly,</HI> finds proven, That at the time the shot was given, and the door opened, that Ferguson the officer, and souldiers, found the pannel and his wife together. 5th December 1704.”</NOTE>, but which had
the effect of saving the pannel's life.</P>
<P>IN regard to the proof of furiosity: It is not disputed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presumptions in cases of Insanity.</NOTE> that
in the case of one who has always been reputed sane, it lies
with the pannel fully to establish this, equally as any other,
defence. But as to the case of lunacy or periodical mad∣ness,
a controversy is agitated in the law books touching the
presumption on the subject, whether it shall be that the deed
was done in furiosity, or in a lucid interval<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mathaeus, <HI>tit. Qui Crim. adm. Poss.</HI> No. 6.</NOTE>. One thing is
obvious on this head, that there is no room for presumptions,
unless in the case, which cannot be a frequent one, that the
jury cannot come to a conclusion either way, upon the proof
of the pannel's situation of mind, as at the time when the
deed was done. For if there be a proof applicable to that
period, and if it either establish no symptoms of disorder,
or but very slight ones, it will not defend the pannel that
<PB N="35" REF="92"/>
he had formerly, (as was the case of Lord Ferrers), and for
a length of time been insane. Now as to situations of a
doubtful character, I can imagine but one, in which it may
be reasonable to presume for the influence of disease upon
the act. I mean the situation of a person, who ordinarily,
and for a course of years has been insane, with but few, and
short, and imperfect intervals of reason; and more especially
this will be just, if he is found with the plain symptoms of
furiosity upon him recently after doing the deed. One, for
instance, who for years has been confined in a mad-house,
if, taking advantage of the occasional liberty which is in∣dulged
him, on the faith of any seeming intermission of his
fury, he shall make his escape from his friends, to whose so∣ciety
he has been restored, and shall kill a person when no
one is by to bear testimony to what passes, and shall after∣wards,
in the course of the same day, be taken in a state of
absolute distraction; he may seem to be within the privi∣lege
of this humane construction. In the case, on the con∣trary,
of one whose lucid intervals have been longer and
more frequent, the presumption upon a doubtful and defec∣tive
proof shall be against him; though by reason of the
faulty habit, and the natural suspicion of the lurking vice,
where it has once shown itself, weaker evidence may
here be admitted to cast the balance, than in the trial of
one who has never been subject to this affliction. The situa∣tion
is still more unfavourable to the pannel, if his ordinary
condition be that of a sound man, or if his lucid intervals
have generally been at stated periods, and of nearly the
same endurance, and the deed is done within the regu∣lar
period of such an interval. But truly it is a vain at∣tempt
to compress within a few short maxims, all the possible
varieties and combinations of these miserable disorders. And
<PB N="36" REF="93"/>
on the whole, it will be much safer to conclude, that if
ever so ambiguous a case shall happen, the question will ra∣ther
be fit for the consideration of the jury, on the whole
history and circumstances of the particular malady, as de∣tailed
in evidence to them, than for the resolution of the
Court, as matter of law, by any general rule.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the result of a verdict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judgment in Ca∣ses of Insanity.</NOTE> finding the de∣fence
of furiosity proved, it cannot well be any other, than
the entire acquittal of the pannel, “<HI>cum satis furore ipso
puniatur</HI>”<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lex 14. tit. 18. lib. 1. Dig.</NOTE>. And this, according to the remark of Sir
Mathew Hale, must equally hold true, of whichever kind
the madness be; whether it be attended with rage, fury,
and tempestuous violence, or is only such as takes away the
use of reason and memory, and leaves the person in a state
of imbecillity and stupor; in which, if, as a machine, he
do any evil, though without <HI>impetus</HI> or rage, it is not a pro∣per
act of his, for which he can be accountable in law. As
to the inferior degrees of derangement, or natural weak∣ness
of intellect, which do not amount to madness, and
for which there can be no rule in law; the relief of these
must be sought either in the discretion of the prosecu∣tor,
who may restrict his libel to an arbitrary pain, or in
the course of application to the King for mercy. Yet I
find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. 1704.</NOTE> that in one case, that of Sommerville, though perhaps
not to be approved of as a precedent, a middle course was
taken, by absolving the pannel from all corporal pain, but
decreeing for a fine to the fiscal, and asythment to the wi∣dow
and children of the deceased.</P>
<P>ONE matter, however, there is, for which, by just and
uniform custom, the Court take order by their sentence,
<PB N="37" REF="94"/>
except in those rarer cases of delirium from fever, or other
bodily disease, for which an undoubted momentary cause
can be assigned. I mean the providing of security to the
public, and to the pannel himself, against the danger of his
malady, if unhappily he shall again be afflicted with it. To
this end, in the case of Sommerville, the Court appointed him
to be confined in the house of correction, “never to be libe∣rated
therefrom, but upon a certificate under the hands of
the magistrates, and two known physicians, that he has
convalesced, and become sound in his judgment.” But
more ordinarily, the course has been to qualify the order of
confinement, by a humane provision, allowing the magistrate
or keeper of the goal to deliver over the pannel to such re∣lation,
or other person, who shall find sufficient bail in the
books of adjournal, to the satisfaction of the Court, and un∣der
such penalty as they shall appoint, to keep and detain
him in safe custody for the future. Deliverance was given
to that effect, in the case of Robert Spence in 1747, of Jean
Blair in 1781, of Robert Coalston in 1785, and of Gordon
Kinloch in 1795; in which last case, the penalty of the
bail-bond was Ten thousand pounds.</P>
<P>III. I HAVE now said sufficient concerning the defences of
nonage and insanity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Defence of Intoxication.</NOTE> and these are properly the only cases
of incapacity of crime, that attaches to, and is inherent in,
the person. But I shall subjoin some observations upon cer∣tain
other situations, where a person altogether sane, and of
the years of discretion, and therefore capable of committing
crimes, may however be alleged to have a privilege, by rea∣son
of the particular circumstances which he is in at the
time of doing the deed. And first, I shall say a word or
two concerning that sort of temporary madness, which is
<PB N="38" REF="95"/>
produced by excess in intoxicating liquors. It has been
alleged, on the authority of a single text, that for this sort
of frailty the Roman law had such indulgence, as in every
case to remit the capital pain <HI>per vinum aut lasciviam lapsis</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. Dig. de Re Militari, No. 7.</NOTE>.
But it is plain, as well from the title of the chapter in the
Digest, where this passage stands, as from the whole scope
and connection of the law, of which it is a part, that this was
no general precept of that system, but a special ordinance,
relative to the case of a soldier, who wounded himself, or
attempted his own life. Some have thought, that even
among soldiers, it concerned him only, who, having slipped
and fallen when in liquor, in this way accidentally gave him∣self
a wound<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Voet. Comment. in lib. 47. tit. 10. Dig. No. 1.</NOTE>. But however this may be, certain it is, that
the law of Scotland regards this wilful madness with a quite
different disposition from the other, which is the visitation
of Providence, and if it does not consider the intemperance
as an aggravation in the case, at least sees very good reason
why it should not be admitted as an excuse for the offender,
to save him from the ordinary pains of his transgression.
For, not to mention that a person cannot well lay claim to
favour, upon the ground of that which itself shews a blame∣able
disregard of decency and order, How are the differ∣ent
degrees of ebriety to be settled, or the real ebriety to
be distinguished from that which is affected; or what protec∣tion
shall there be on this plan against the attempts of such
who may inflame themselves with liquor, for the purpose of
gaining courage to indulge their passions, and an opportunity
to do it safely? Besides, if there were even no danger of such
contrivances, a security is indispensible to be provided to
<PB N="39" REF="96"/>
the peaceable and decent part of the community, who would
otherwise be delivered into the discretion of the dissolute
and worthless. For these substantial reasons, our custom
utterly disowns this defence, and this generally, and with∣out
regard to that distinction, which has often been urged,
but is not suited to practice, “<HI>inter ebrios et ebriosos,”</HI> be∣tween
such as are habitual drunkards, or are only accident∣ally
in liquor. This was pled and repelled, in the case of Jo∣seph
Hume, in February 1732, which was a case of murder.
Likewise in the case of Maclauchlan, in March 1737, for
murder and riot, the general plea was argued and repelled;
as it had long ago been in another case of murder, that of
Hamilton of Green,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July, August 1716.</NOTE> and in many prior cases.</P>
<P>BUT although this be a just and salutary rule, in its appli∣cation
to crimes, such as those that have been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Defence of Intoxication.</NOTE>
yet it seems to be questionable, though I have not observed
that any author makes the distinction, whether the same
holds equally true of all offences without exception. There
are several offences of that nature, which neither are so
tempting to the delinquent by any profit that is attached to
them, nor are attended with any <HI>necessary</HI> or immediate da∣mage
to a neighbour or to society, and which indeed are
chiefly reputed criminal on account of the violation of or∣der
and decency, and the <HI>possible</HI> evil influence on the
minds of such who come to the knowledge of them. Of
this description are blasphemy, heresy, leasing-making, the
uttering of seditious words, and some others, which are
chiefly punished, as an insult to the order of the state, or
as tending to lessen the respect of the hearers for the Prince,
or their veneration for the truths of religion. Now, in any
of these points of view, not only is the wickedness of the
transgressor lessened in our opinion, if he was not in the
<PB N="40" REF="97"/>
due possession of his faculties at the time, but the injury it∣self
to the community, the possible harm and contagion
of his example, is prevented; whereas, in a case of fire-raising,
robbery, murder, or the like, the mischief is always
the same, whatsoever, in that respect, have been the condi∣tion
of the actor. But if a person go to hear mass in liquor,
who is a good protestant when he is sober, or if an orthodox
and pious citizen shall be prophane, or heretical, or blas∣phemous,
in his liquor, or if a loyal and well affected sub∣ject
in the same condition shall forget his principles, and
utter calumnies against the King; in any of these cases, who
is there that heeds or regards him? His example does not
seduce, his doctrines do not lay hold or any man's mind,
because they are not seriously taught, nor can be said to be
truly his: The words are not even in the hearing so offen∣sive
to the ears of the bystanders, as in the mouth of one
who advisedly utters them; nor can the State or Church rea∣sonably
feel the same resentment of them, as of a malicious
and deliberate insult. Many other situations may be imagi∣ned,
in which there seem to be the like reasons for mitiga∣tion
of the ordinary pains; I say for mitigation, for I would
not be understood to argue for entire impunity, nor even
for mitigation, unless it appear on the whole circumstances
of the case, that the transgression is fairly imputable to the
condition of the man at the time. But in this I have only
been delivering my own sentiment, which is not supported
with any precedent, nay, has even to struggle with an ex∣press
judgment to the contrary, and given too in a case
which was favourable to the pannel. In 1697, Patrick
Kinninmount was tried for blasphemy by railing against
God, upon a libel which concluded for the pains of death.
Among other defences, it was pleaded for him, that if he
<PB N="41" REF="98"/>
ever uttered such words, it was in a state of fury or distrac∣tion,
occasioned by excess in liquor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1697.</NOTE> The Court “finds the
defence that the pannel was furious or distracted in his
wits relevant, in the terms of the act of Parliament, but
repels the allegeance of fury or distraction arising from
drunkenness, and also repels the haill other defences.”
Yet it may be observed, with respect to the offences provided
for in the statute 6th Anne, c. 7. that it is only by the mali∣cious
and advised assertion of the pretender's title, and the
advised denial of the right of Parliament to limit the de∣scent
of the Crown by laws, that the pains of <HI>praemunire</HI> are
incurred; which is thus far an adoption of the principle
I have suggested, and in the sort of case to which I have
applied it.</P>
<P>IV. LET us next consider the effect in law of that more
favourable sort of constraint upon the will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Plea of Subjection.</NOTE> which is not of
the offender's own producing, but arises from the state of
subjection in which he is with respect to others, by whose
command he does the evil deed, knowing it to be wrong,
and contrary to what his own free will would determine.</P>
<P>1. AND first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As between Wife and Hus∣band</NOTE> I shall speak of that subjection which arises
by reason of the relations of private life, as that of the
wife to the husband, the child to the parent, the servant to
the master. With respect to the wife; That for any atro∣cious
crime, such as treason, murder, or fire-raising, which
she commits either in company with her husband, or in com∣pliance
with his command, she is equally liable as he to the
ordinary pains, this never was denied to be law: for these
things are <HI>mala in se,</HI> and against all the original feelings
of right or humanity, which are paramount to the duties
<PB N="42" REF="99"/>
of the relation. To give but one instance of a rule which
is so obviously necessary:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1735.</NOTE>. In the case of James Brown and
Elizabeth Chalmers his wife, where the charge was for
jointly beating Brown's mother, so that she died, this was
sustained as a capital dittay against both.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords find, That James Brown pannell, having at the time and place lybelled beat or cursed the deceased Anna Cockburn his mother, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of moveables; as also, Find that the said James Brown and Elizabeth Chalmers, the other pannell, that they or either of them, having at the time and place lybelled, beaten the said Anna to that degree, that she of the stroaks given her, did shortly thereafter dye; or that they, or either of them, were art and part of the murder of the said Anna, relevant to infer the foresaid pains; and, <HI>separatim,</HI> the said Lords find, That at time and place ly∣belled, she the said Elizabeth Chalmers having beaten the said A. C. relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment. 4th August 1735.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT even with respect to the less heinous offences, such
as theft, reset of theft, forgery, or the like, I cannot learn
that our law, like that of England<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 28.</NOTE>, will be so indulgent
to her, as to presume in her favour, that what she does
<HI>in assistance</HI> of her husband, or <HI>in his presence,</HI> is done
against her will, and out of dread of his authority, and
on that ground to protect her from all manner of pain.
According to any precedents that can be shewn in our re∣cords,
if the husband and wife go out together and steal, or
if the husband steal, and the wife receive the spoil into
her private repositories and particular keeping<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><HI>In certis autem casibus, tenetur uxor respondere: scilicet si furtum, vel male ficium aliquod viri sui, inveniatur sub clavibus suis, quas ipsa debet habere in cus∣todia et cura sua; videlicet de spensa et arca robarum, et jocalium suorum; et de scrinio seu coffero suo. Et si aliquod furtum sub talibus clavibus inveniatur, uxor cum viro, culpabilis est.</HI> Statuta Wilhelmi, cap. 19.</NOTE>, or if the
<PB N="43" REF="100"/>
husband forge the notes, and the wife is employed to put
them in circulation, we will rather be disposed to follow
the precept of the old laws of William for such cases,
which holds both for guilty, and punishes them according
to their demerits. “<HI>Sed cum fuerunt ambo participes in crimine
sic erunt quoque et in poena. Et licet uxor obedire debeat viro
suo, tamen in atrocibus obedire non debet. Et sic debet uterque
puniri secundum demerita sua.</HI>”</P>
<P>THE libel against John Bell, and Elizabeth his wife, for
shop-breaking, reset of theft, and harbouring of thieves,
was accordingly found relevant against either of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 14. 18. 1736.</NOTE> and
on conviction of the last of these charges, the same pain
was inflicted on both. Likewise, upon the libel against David
Pinkerton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 22. 1726.</NOTE> Helen Baillie his wife, John Marshall, and So∣phia
Pinkerton his wife, which bore a charge of their being
Egyptians, and guilty, of diverse thefts, violences, robberies,
and attempts to rob, committed by them in company, they
were severally found relevant to infer death or arbitrary
pain against Helen Baillie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Find the said pannell Pinkerton <HI>alias</HI> Maxwell. John Marshall and <HI>Helen Baillie</HI> alias <HI>Douglus,</HI> pannells, or any of them, their being habite and repute to be Aegyptians, sorners or masterful beggars, in conjunction with the said pan∣nells, or any of them, their being the times and places lybelled, guilty, ast and part of the facts of violence, theft, robbery, or attempts of robbery lybelled, or any of the said facts, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of move∣ables:. … … Find the said pannells, or either of them, their being guilty of any of the other facts lybelled, except the said murder and robbery last mention∣ed, or that they were art and part thereof, <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer an arbi∣trary punishment.</NOTE>, and her associates; and it was
only upon, the consent of the prosecutor with regard to So∣phia
Pinkerton, who was a young woman, and the daughter
of the pannel David Pinkerton, that the charge as to her
was restricted to an arbitrary pain. The like relevancy had
<PB N="44" REF="101"/>
been found in the case of John Baillie, his wife and chil∣dren,
another knot of the same society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 14. 1698.</NOTE> and accused of the
like transgressions. To these I shall only add the case of
George Lamb and his wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25. and Dec. 11. 1695.</NOTE> who, along with others, were
accused of deforcing a messenger in the execution of a cap∣tion;
and against these spouses in particular, it was charged,
that having decoyed the messenger to their house, by pro∣mise
of protection, they, after his entrance, extinguished
the lights, threw open the doors, and gave access to a
rabble to beat him. Now, this was found equally relevant
against both<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Find that part of the lybell anent the beating or invading the messenger or his assistants, relevant to infer the pain of deforcement; and likewise, found the qualifications following, <HI>viz.</HI> That the pannells invited the messenger into their house, and entered in commoning, and promised protection, and thereafter did blow out the candle, and opened the back-door, and let in the rabble, relevant joyntly, <HI>per se,</HI> to inferr an arbitrary punishment, and repel the defences pro∣poned for the pannells.</NOTE>: But they had a verdict in their favour.</P>
<P>AND truly I see nothing exceptionable in the disposition of
our law: because the ordinary case will be, that the spouses
mutually confirm each other in their profligacy, or if there
be seduction in the case, it may as well be on the part of the
woman, as the man. The utmost lenity, therefore, to which
our practice might be inclined, would be to excuse the wife
for venial trespasses or petty crimes, to which her obedience
of his orders may have constrained her, and to mitigate
her sentence for the more grave offences, if the circumstan∣ces
of the case make it reasonable to believe, that she is the
less guilty of the two. Perhaps, it may also be expected,
that in the case of threats or violence employed by the
husband to coerce her, a lesser degree of terror shall excuse
the submission of the wife, who is habitually subject to his
<PB N="45" REF="102"/>
power, and has not the same means of escape from his rent∣ment,
as a stranger. Last of all, it is not to be believed
that in any case the wife shall be held guilty, or be impli∣cated
as art and part of the husband's crime, by affording
him that harbourage or concealment and comfort after the
fact, which the feelings of nature and duty require of her
at that season of distress and terror, when her fidelity has
become his only refuge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Uxor alicujus desponsata, non tenetur virum suum accusare, nec furtum suum, nec feloniam detegere; cum ipsa sui ipsius potestatem non habeat. <HI>Stat. Will. cap. 19. No.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. Neither, if she were disposed,
is it to be presumed that she has it in her power, to refuse
him this assistance.</P>
<P>2. WITH respect to children.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of the Child to the Pa∣rent.</NOTE> If, with the father's pre∣sence
and command, or perhaps in this instance his com∣mand
without his presence, there concur the great youth
of the child, it may procure him a mitigation of the or∣dinary
pains, in the case of a high crime, or perhaps en∣tirely
absolve him, if the offence be venial or trifling. As
it did in the case of John Rae,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 21. 1662.</NOTE> a boy of twelve years
old, who being prosecuted for stealing four sheep, in com∣pany
with his father, was assoilzied by the Court, “in
respect of his nonage as said, and that what he did was
in obedience to his father's command.” Mackenzie
hath quoted this case as in proof of the <HI>general</HI> posi∣tion,
That the command of the father will entirely free the
child from the guilt of the inferior offences; and on another
occasion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Punishments, No. 5.</NOTE> he expresses himself more largely, as if this of itself
would also mitigate the pain of the more atrocious crimes.
<PB N="46" REF="103"/>
But it is plain that this decision, which is mainly grounded
in the <HI>age</HI> of the pannel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The plea is entered for him in the record in these words: “That John Rae younger, not being as yet twelve years of age, and so not <HI>doli capax,</HI> ought not to be put to the knowledge of ane assize.”</NOTE>, will not support so broad a privi∣lege;
neither have I met with any other judgment which
atributes any higher power to the command of a father,
than as a favourable circumstance, along with others, to ex∣tenuate
the guilt of the child. In the case, particularly of
John Mackintosh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1673.</NOTE> and Angus his son, where the father's or∣der
to commit the slaughter was libelled, and which was
fully debated on all the other points, no such plea for the
son was even ventured to be maintained. In that of Donald
and Charles Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6, &amp; 9. 1671.</NOTE> it was, however stated, and upon
full pleading was repelled; though the case was thus far
favourable, that these pannels were boys, alleged to be un∣der
fourteen years of age, and the crime was only the cast∣ing
down of certain houses, and carrying off the materials,
to which their father claimed right as his own. Mention
has also been made of the case of Samuel Pirrie, in later
times, where the instigation of a mother-in-law to a boy of
fourteen to steal, had not even the effect of saving him from
judgment of death. Nevertheless, as in the case of a wife,
it may be true that greater allowance shall be made for ac∣tual
coercion or violence employed against the child, because
of the situation of dependence, and habit of submission,
wherein he stands with respect to the father.</P>
<P>3. The case of a servant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Subjec∣tion of a Ser∣vant.</NOTE> according to Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Art and Part, No. 5.</NOTE>, is
nearly the same as that of a child; so that the command
<PB N="47" REF="104"/>
of the master entirely excuses him in the lesser crimes, and
even saves him from the ordinary pain of the more atrocious,
if the master is known to be cruel. But I conceive, that in
this he is rather to be understood as speaking with relation to
those cases, where, beside the order, the servant has to allege
actual coercion by the master, and the reasonable fear of vio∣lence,
against which he has no sure or near protection. As,
for instance, if a person ignorantly engages as servant to a
Highland depredator, and is carried out upon an expedition
by his master and his associates, who, with threats and drawn
swords, compel him to accompany them, and be present at
their excesses. At least, if Mackenzie meant to lay down this
position generally, his doctrine, for aught that I can find, is not
grounded in the practice of the Court, as well as it seems not
to be safe nor reasonable in itself. A plea of this sort was set
up in the case of Dougal Macfarlane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1737.</NOTE> tried for way-laying
and beating an excise-officer, so that he died; which he alleg∣ed
was done upon the order of his master and mistress, and in
revenge of their quarrel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“ And in lesser crimes, the command of the master excuseth altogether, <HI>Lex Homo, ff. ad Leg. Aquil.</HI> Now, I subsume in the terms of this, that what∣ever was done by me in this affair, was done by the command of my master or Mrs Macara, both, or one or other of them. … Whatever it was that happened, or was intended, all was done at the command or desire of my said master and mistress. If they had bid kill, I own it might have looked odd to plead their mandate, for a crime that nature starts at, but to <HI>cuff</HI> is not so shock∣ing to nature, and a master or mistress will readily be obeyed in such a case by their servant, especially in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where almost unlimited obedience is paid to superiors, and such chastisements not much reckoned on. And the mandator is liable for the excess as well as for the precise fact he commissioned to be done.” This is a passage from the information for the pannel.</NOTE>. But this and all his other defen∣ces
were repelled. The like defence had the same issue in
the prior case of James Hamilton and others, tenants and
<PB N="48" REF="105"/>
dependents of the Earl of Roseberry, who pled their ma∣ster's
warrant for deforcing certain officers in the execution
of a poinding of his effects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 3. 11. 1726.</NOTE> They were convicted, and
had sentence for the statutory pains of deforcement. More
expressly still, the same judgment had been given in the
older and more favourable case of James Graham.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 8. and July 1. 1717.</NOTE> This
man was accused of a robbery, committed by him in com∣pany
with the noted Rob Roy Macgrigor and his gang.
Two defences were pleaded for him; the one that he was co∣erced
by force of arms, and dread of his life, the other that
he was a servant under the command of Roy or of a person
who was one of his gang, and was therefore to be excused
from the ordinary pain; in support of which position, the
authority of Mackenzie was produced. Now, only the first
of these defences was sustained.</P>
<P>4. IN the case of persons who are not connected by any
of these relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Plea of Compulsion.</NOTE> it seems proper to distinguish between situ∣ations
of great commotion, or extensive danger, and the ordi∣nary
situation of a quiet and well regulated society. In
time of war or rebellion, by which the magistrate is over∣powered,
and the protection of the law suspended, allowance
must be made for individuals, if, in this helpless state, they
to a certain extent suffer the great law of self-preservation to
govern their conduct for the time. A person is not there∣fore
guilty of treason, who being in a part of the country
that is commanded by the rebels, yields them against his
will supply of money, or of arms and provisions, having no
means of declining their demands, and being in the reason∣able
fear of military execution if he refuse. I shall not even
say whether this may not go the length of excusing him,
though he be with them for a time in arms, provided he
<PB N="49" REF="106"/>
prove a special and outrageous compulsion of him in that
particular, and that he quit them with the first opportunity,
and do no act of hostility while he remains with them, other
than is fairly imputable to the constraint of his situation.
There is an instance of the former in the case of William
and John Riddell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. 1681.</NOTE> indicted for treason, in furnishing the re∣bels
with provisions, and transporting their cannon. The
Court “find the defence proponed for the pannel relevant,
he always proving <HI>vis major</HI> and force to every act of
furnishing the rebels with meat and drink, and assisting
them in carrying of their cannons, to elide that part of
the dittay<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The assize find, “That the woman did carry ale, and did deliver ale and bread, to be carried to the rebels; but finds it not proven, that the pannell William Riddell had any accession thereto; and as to the furnishing of malt lybelled, they all in one voice assoilzie the pannell <HI>simpliciter, because he was compelled thereto.</HI>” On the 21st November, he was ordered to be set at liber∣ty, on taking the test.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE same excuse may even be admitted in cases of less
extensive commotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Crime on Compulsion.</NOTE> if the situation be truly such with re∣spect
to the individual, that he is in a state of helplessness
and danger for the time. A mob, for instance, or tumultu∣ous
convocation, are moving on their enterprise; and on
their way, as sometimes happens, they take possession of
such as they meet, and compel them, in appearance at least,
to take part in the adventure, and augment their strength.
There can be no doubt that such an allegation, duly quali∣fied,
and made out by apt <HI>indicia,</HI> and not contradicted by
other circumstances of an opposite character in the behavi∣our
of the pannel, is relevant to acquit him of the charge.
Here I may quote the case of Andrew Fairney, James Pur∣die,
<PB N="50" REF="107"/>
and others, where, in as far as concerns Purdic, the
interlocutor is thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1720.</NOTE> “And for eliding the qualification
libelled against James Purdie, <HI>viz.</HI> That he carried and
beat a drum amongst any of the said mobs, sustains the de∣fence
relevant, that he was forced and compelled thereto
by the said mob.” The defence of constraint and compul∣sion
was also found relevant in the case of William Gilchrist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. and 12. 1741.</NOTE>
indicted as one of a mob, who broke into and plundered a
mill<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the lybell and several articles thereof relevant to infer the pains of law; but allow the pannell to prove the alledged force and continuance there∣of, and his conduct and behaviour during the time of the riot, for elideing or alleviating any part of the said lybell.”</NOTE>. Likewise in the case of Robert Main and others,
we find both the rule and the proper limitations of it
set forth as follows:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11. 1725.</NOTE> “Finds the said Robert Main's de∣fence,
<HI>viz.</HI> That he was forced to take a gun by the
disorderly people who were running that way, and who
threatened to knock him down if he would not take
it, relevant to exculpate him as to his being in arms,
by having the said gun in that place where he was so for∣ced,
but not relevant as to his having the gun in any other
place, unless the force was so continued, that he▪ could not
with safety lay his gun aside, or withdraw from the com∣pany
who forced him.”</P>
<P>ONE of the charges, which seems more readily than most
others to admit this defence, is that of piracy: Because it
often happens that those who are engaged in this lawless
and desperate course of life, do by main force, from which
there is no relief in these circumstances, compel the ma∣riners
on board the prizes which they make, to pass into
the piratical vessel, and take part with them in their mis∣deeds.
On the trial, therefore, of Roger Hews and sixteen
<PB N="51" REF="108"/>
others, in the Court of Admiralty, the judge “sustains the
the defence proponed for the pannels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1720.</NOTE> that they, or any
one or more of them, were compelled to join themselves
with the pirates by force, or through fear, by the pirates
threatening the pannels to deprive them of their lives,
and that during the committing of the several piracies
set forth in the indictment, the said pannels continued
under such force or fear.” The jury “found the de∣fences
of force, and fear of death, and sickness, pro∣ven,”
in favour of seven of the pannels, who were ac∣cordingly
dismissed from the bar.</P>
<P>FARTHER still, there may be situations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Crime on Compulsion.</NOTE> though more un∣common
now than they once were, of a more special and
private violence, which shall be judged by the same rule.
In the beginning of this century, while some parts of Scot∣land
had not yet been reduced to the due state of discipline,
or sense of order, but were infested with gangs of russians,
who levied contribution, and committed all manner of ex∣cess
without fear or restraint, the condition of those quar∣ters
was truly little different from a state of war. So that a
person, himself nowise disposed to such a way of life, might for
a time, through near neighbourhood, or by reason of offence
given them, or the like, find himself entangled in some share
of a criminal enterprise, entirely against his will. The case,
already mentioned, of James Graham, seems to have been
of this description. The charge against him was, that in
company with Rob Roy and his gang, he had gone armed
to Chapel Arroch, and there seized, carried off, and robbed
the Duke of Montrose's steward, who had gone thither to
collect his master's rents. He pled, that in the night pre∣ceding
this robbery, the house in which he lived was beset
<PB N="52" REF="109"/>
by Rob Roy, with fifteen armed men, who commanded him
to come forth, and on his refusal threatened him with pistol
and drawn sword, to shoot or cleave him to the teeth, and
at length dragged him out and forced him away, as well as
they renewed their threats, on his attempting to escape from
them in the course of their expedition. These things the
Court found jointly relevant <HI>simpliciter</HI> to acquit him. As
also, they found it sufficient to restrict the charge to an ar∣bitrary
pain, that though not at first forced out by such ex∣treme
violence, he was, however, under restraint by force,
at the time when the robbery was committed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1st July 1717. “Sustain the defence proponed for the pannell, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was compelled by being threatened with a pistol or drawn sword, and drag∣ged out of his master's house by two of Rob Roy's men, the day before com∣mitting of the crimes lybelled, and that he continued under restraint by force of arms, the time of committing the said crimes, jointly relevant to assoilzie <HI>simpliciter</HI> from the indictment; and likewise sustain this defence, that the pan∣nell, the time of committing the said crimes lybelled, was under restraint by force, relevant to restrict the indictment to an arbitrary punishment; and repell the haill other defences proponed for the pannell.”</NOTE>. The jury
found it proved, “That he was present in arms along with
Roy and others at the time when the robbery was com∣mitted,
but that he was forced into the service in man∣ner
mentioned, and that he was not possessed of arms to
make resistance at the time.” Upon which verdict he
was assoilzied.</P>
<P>IN this particular case, the defence seems to have been
fully made out. But generally, and with relation to the or∣dinary
condition of a well regulated society, in which eve∣ry
individual is under the shield of the law, and has oppor∣tunity
of resorting to that protection upon any apprehen∣sion
of violence, this is at least a difficult plea, and which
will hardly be effectual against the charge of any atrocious
<PB N="53" REF="110"/>
crime, without the concurrence of these qualifications; an
immediate danger of death or great bodily harm, an inabi∣lity
to escape that danger, or resist the violence, a back∣ward
and subordinate part in the business, and disclosure
of the guilt, as well as restitution of the profit, with the
first safe and convenient occasion. For, if either the pan∣nel
take a very active part in the execution of the crime, or
if he conceal the guilt, and detain his share of the profit,
after his return to a state of freedom; any of these replies
will in a great measure elide his defence.</P>
<P>5. I SHALL be very brief in speaking of that subjection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Magistrate to the Law.</NOTE>
which arises out of the relations of a public nature, as be∣tween
the judge and the legislature, the magistrate and the
ministers of the law under him, or soldier and commanding
officer.</P>
<P>IT may be a question in morals, in the case of a judge
who finds it enjoined him to execute an unjust and oppres∣sive
law, whether he ought not rather to resign the office,
which engages him in such difficulties, and thus sets law and
conscience at war. But in no human tribunal can the sub∣ject
of any land be called in question for execution of the
subsisting laws: It is only in virtue of those same laws that
he is vested with the office of judge, and in opposing or re∣fusing
to obey them, he would destroy the very source of
his own authority and commission. The judges of former
times were not therefore punishable for trying traitors in
absence, after the statute which passed in that behalf, nor. for
executing the laws against witchcraft, upon conviction ob∣tained
according to the approved customary mode of evi∣dence
in the practice of their day.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="111"/>
IT will not in every case be governed by the same rule,
if,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Officer to the Magistrate.</NOTE> through gross ignorance or carelessness, the magistrate
pronounce an unlawful sentence, which is carried into effect
by the inferior ministers of the law, upon his warrant.
Take for example the case of a murderer, executed upon
sentence of the Sheriff-court, which cannot try for murder,
or the case of capital sentence, which erroneously orders
execution to take place within the period, which is allowed
the convict by the statute in that behalf. It may seem that
there is room for a distinction in this matter, according to the
officer's state of information, at the time when he proceeded.
If it can be shewn that he was in the knowledge of the nullity,
or had reasonable ground of suspicion on the subject, which
may sometimes be from the nature of the thing itself, as if
the order were to poison a convict, or privately to strangle
him in goal, certainly he shall have no excuse in the com∣mand
of his superior, whose wrong he thus adopts and takes
upon himself; for if in these circumstances he obey the
warrant, it is out of choice, and he cannot be held free of
<HI>malus animus</HI> towards the person, whom he thus wilfully, de∣liberately,
and unnecessarily destroys. But, which is more
probable, if the officer proceeded without any knowledge or
suspicion of the wrong, and having the accustomed warrant
under the hand of his superior, this seems either to be no
crime at all on his part, or, at least, it is both lower in de∣gree,
and of a different kind, than that of the judge, and
can only be punished in the officer, on the expedient prin∣ciple
of teaching the highest caution to all concerned in the
conduct of this interesting part of justice. For, in like
manner as the law is paramount to all classes of people in
the kingdom, so where the political establishment places
one officer in authority over another, the obedience of the
<PB N="55" REF="112"/>
inferior is truly obedience to the law, which has given him
this general direction for his conduct. Neither, if he was
not warned, can he be held blameable or careless, that he
did not discover the error into which the magistrate had
fallen; for he was entitled to repose in confidence of the
superior skill and attention of that person in the department
of his duty. He intended to do a lawful act, and had right
to think it such; whereby the error in that respect is thus,
as to him, an error in point of fact only; which ought to
excuse him, as that sort of error does in other cases. It is
quite another question, where a person, acting of his own
choice, happens, upon an erroneous apprehension of the law,
to do an unlawful thing, to plunder a wrecked vessel, for in∣stance,
or to kill an outlawed or excommunicated person.
For the judge cannot excuse this ignorance in one who is
acting without necessity, and who ought therefore to be sure
of his warrant, before he venture to put forth his hand
against the goods or person of his neighbour.</P>
<P>WITH regard to soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Soldiers to Of∣ficers.</NOTE> who are trained to a still stricter
discipline, and are bound to obedience of orders by far
higher penalties, I shall only say, that any plea which may
be grounded upon these favourable considerations, must at
least be received under certain provisions, without which
it would both be very dangerous and unjust. The order
must be such which falls within the bounds of the offi∣cer's
commission, and known customary line of duty, and
though given in his proper department, it must farther be at
least an excusable order, or of that nature to be the subject of
different opinions, not a plain injury and aggression on his
part. If he should order out a party to rescue him from a
messenger, who has him in custody for debt, any slaughter
<PB N="56" REF="113"/>
or other injury which ensues upon so irregular an enter∣prize,
would be at the equal hazard of the officer, and of
all who are concerned in the execution of it. And the same
would be true, if, being on guard with his party, he should
order them to fire upon an inoffensive meeting of the people;
a command which he is punishable for giving, and which
they may lawfully disobey. The case of William Ferguson
and others, soldiers in the Earl of Errol's regiment of mi∣litia,
was a plain unfavourable case in both of these respects:
For the pannels and their party had been sent out to poind for
deficiencies in the quota of militia-men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. and 6. 1674.</NOTE> upon the warrant
of their officer only, who had no right to give such a war∣rant,
and they had been guilty of great excess and precipi∣tation
in putting it to execution. But cases of this descrip∣tion
have been rare. And in those, which more frequently
happen, of an ambiguous character, the humane considera∣tion
of the situation of the soldier, who has acted in the be∣lief
of duty, and under the habit and constraint of military
discipline, has generally made the prosecution be confined
to the officer alone, as source and author of the wrong.
This was the course in the case of Captain Wallace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1692.</NOTE> and
in the still more noted case of Captain Porteous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1736.</NOTE> though in
both the order to fire had been obeyed by all, or many of
the party, under the officer's command. But I do not intend
to enter at large, into an article of such delicate discussion.</P>
<P>6. I KNOW not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plea of Compul∣sion by Want.</NOTE> if it is necessary to take notice of one
other sort of constraint, that which arises from the pressure
of extreme want, and has tempted to the doing of such a
thing, as serves to the support of nature for the time. As
might be expected, jurists have differed about the justice of
punishing in such a case, some affirming that the notion of
<PB N="57" REF="114"/>
dole is utterly excluded in these circumstances of misery, or
at least that they are a plea to mitigation of the ordinary
pains, while others deny that they are at all available in law.
With us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. tit. 16.</NOTE> reference is made in support of the merciful opi∣nion,
to that chapter of the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> entitled, <HI>de
Lege Burthynsack,</HI> under which, according to one construc∣tion
of it, a man is not at all to be punished for the theft of
a calf, or a ram, or of as much meat as he can carry on his
back. But the passage does not distinguish whether the
thief be necessitous or not; and taking the whole sections of
the chapter in connection, the meaning may rather seem to
be, that for a theft to this amount, a person shall not be
punished capitally. In which sense it had been understood
by Skene<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Skene's Treatise of Crimes, cap. 13. No. 9.</NOTE>, who says, with reference to this law of Burdin∣seck,
that such a thief “should not be put to death but
should be scourged.” Whatever may be its true meaning,
the passage will not now be of much weight in the solution
of this important question; which seems not to be attend∣ed
with any peculiar difficulty, if, instead of resorting to ar∣tificial
arguments, it be but treated on the obvious and sub∣stantial
grounds in the nature of the case. Certainly there is
a wide difference between a single act of theft committed
in this situation of distress, and the rapacious invasion of
the property of others, by one who makes a trade of such
injustice. Yet, on the other side, the danger, or rather the
impracticability, is evident, of incorporating this exception
into the common law and practice of the land, and subjec∣ting
it, like other defences, to the discussion of the judge
and jury. If there were no other obstacle, where is the
possible rule, by which to settle the due measure of distress,
which shall excuse? Or how shall the real necessity be known
<PB N="58" REF="115"/>
from that which is pretended, or that which comes of inno∣cent
and unavoidable misfortune, from the just consequences
of a vicious or criminal course of conduct? Yet to distin∣guish
in this matter according to the sources and occasions
of the indigence, and therefore to investigate the whole
history of the offender's life, would be indispensible to ju∣stice,
if in any case the law were to listen to this excuse.</P>
<P>BUT truly, there are far higher considerations against the
admitting of such a rule, which would at once infringe all
security of property, by confounding the common notions
of right and honesty among the people, and throwing into
every man's own hand the estimation, in the first instance,
of his own wants, and of the impossibility of relieving them
in any more lawful course. It is grounded, therefore, in
sound reason, and substantial justice, and is, as I conceive,
the settled law of Scotland, that the judge shall apply the or∣dinary
pains of law in this, as in every other case, where a
person knowingly, and for his own advantage, has taken
the property of his neighbour; leaving it to the necessitous
offender to supplicate his relief from the Sovereign, who is
the source of mercy, and who will not refuse to listen, if
there be cause for him to interpose. Thus the rigid and sa∣lutary
precept of the law is maintained entire, and humani∣ty
at the same time is consulted, without the risk of any of
these multiplied evils and disorders, which would follow on
a more enlarged scheme of indulgence. And herein, ac∣cording
to the judicious observation of Judge Blackstone,
appears the benefit of that monarchical form of government,
which so naturally admits of this gracious prerogative,
which in more popular governments is the object of jea∣lousy,
and cannot so easily, nor to the same advantage, be
arranged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THEFT AND STOUTHRIEF.</HEAD>
<P>IN considering that class of offences which are committed
against the property of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II.</NOTE> I naturally begin with
the crime of theft, that sort of invasion of property, which
being attended with a profit to the offender, as well as a da∣mage
to the owner, is more frequently committed than any
other. And first, of the nature of the crime: whereof all
the necessary qualifications seem to be set forth in that short
description of it, given in the civil law, <HI>contrectatio rei frau∣dulosa,
lucri faciendi gratia;</HI> the felonious taking and carry∣ing
away of the property of another, for profit.</P>
<P>I. THE fundamental circumstance, and which all the
others only qualify, is this of the <HI>taking,</HI> or as our lawyers,
after the stile of the civil law, have sometimes termed it,
The Contrectation of the Thing. In which it is implied,
that the thing has not previously been in the possession of
the thief, but in that of the owner, or some other person for
him, out of which the thief, without consent of the owner,
removes it. Now with this article, simple as at first it ap∣pears
to be, opens a wide field of discussion; as upon the
<PB N="60" REF="117"/>
due understanding of this matter, in some measure depends
the distinction between theft, and those other criminal, but
as the law deems them, inferior offences, of fraud, swindling,
and breach of trust, which are nearly allied to theft, and
liable to be confounded with it. And here, without pretend∣ing
to furnish an invariable criterion for distinguishing
these offences one from another, or to resolve all those nice
debates, which have exercised the ingenuity of the ablest
lawyers of either kingdom, I shall rather content myself
with stating, on the one and the other part, certain descrip∣tions
of cases, which are clearly referible to different deno∣minations
of crime; hopeful that in this course the circle
of controversy shall at least be narrowed, if not some notion
attained of the true principle, on which the decision of the
still more difficult situations may turn.</P>
<P>1. IN the first place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Theft and Swindling.</NOTE> all cases seem to fall under the notion
of fraud or swindling only, and not of theft, in which the
pannel attains possession of the thing on a title and bargain
as for the <HI>property,</HI> upon credit, though the bargain be ac∣complished
by means of cozenage and falsehood. As in the
case of one, who falsely pretends to be partner of a certain
thriving house, and thus buys and gets delivery of goods, to
be paid at a future day. Or as in the case of Thomas Hall,
tried in July 1789, who came to Edinburgh, falsely pretending
to be a trader, and in prosecution of this plan hired and
opened shop, and having, on the trust of this character, ob∣tained
goods from sundry dealers upon credit, suddenly dis∣appeared,
and carried off the goods along with him. In all
cases of this description, the offender's wrong lieth only in
the false and fraudulent inducement, which he has held
forth to the owner, for prevailing on him to contract. But
<PB N="61" REF="118"/>
how unfairly soever he obtained it, he hath actually had the
consent of the owner to convey that thing to him in pro∣perty,
to be his, and in all respects at his disposal, till the
day of payment come. Which bargain being followed with
delivery of the thing, the property thereof, notwithstanding
the fraud, in the mean time passeth to the buyer; in so
much that any one who should <HI>bona fide</HI> buy and get deli∣very
of this same thing from him in course of trade, would
not even be liable to the first owner's claim of restitution,
which is only personal against his own customer, the author
of the wrong. The owner, therefore, has himself only to
blame in such a case, that having his choice to sell on credit
or for ready money, and thus to be absolutely secure, he vo∣luntarily
chose the former, and knew not the person better,
whom he dealt with on such terms. He relied, in contract∣ing,
either on the faith of the buyer, that he would not at∣tempt
to cheat him, or on his own sagacity, for discovering
any such evil purpose, and his interest must be ruled accord∣ingly;
whereas in the case of a theftous abstraction, there is
no giving of the thing to the offender, out of any reliance on
him, and to be his own, but a taking of it by him, without
even a seeming title of property or consent of the owner.
In the case of Hall, the offence was therefore prosecuted
as fraud, and not as theft<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Notice may also be taken of the case of Robert Taylor, 26th January 1674, who was charged with theft and stouthrief on this ground, that the parties being together at a fair, and having gone into an alehouse, they there bargained for the sale of ninety-five oxen, at so much a-head, which was to be paid either instantly, <HI>or within a few days.</HI> The buyer's servant, in the mean time, without the pur∣suer's consent, drove off the cattle cross the border, and the pursuer having fol∣lowed to Carlisle, he was there, under pretence of a debt to the pannel, impri∣soned. On this <HI>species facti,</HI> where the intromission was on a bargain of <HI>sale,</HI> and not insisted to have been <HI>absolutely</HI> for ready money, and not accompanied with a pointed averment, that the whole transaction was from the first a trick, the pursuer found it necessary to desert his charge of <HI>theft,</HI> and turn it into a charge of oppression, which, in the end, was found irrelevant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="119"/>
2. EVEN if the thing be delivered by the owner upon
some lower title than that of property,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Theft and Breach of Trust.</NOTE> as in the case of a
watch given to another in loan, or of a horse let to hyre,
or a pack of goods sent by a carrier, to be delivered at a cer∣tain
place, the after-conversion of the thing to the possessor's
own use, by selling the watch or horse, or opening the pack
and abstracting the contents or part thereof, though it is a
wrong, and even a criminal act, does not however amount
to the crime of theft. The reason lies here, That there
has been no felonious <HI>taking</HI> of the thing out of the owner's
possession. Upon these cases, as above imagined, the man
at first had obtained the thing honestly, by a fair contract,
in ordinary course of business, and meaning no other, as at
that time, but to restore or deliver it, according to his du∣ty.
At the instant, therefore, of delivery made in pursu∣ance
of that contract, the owner's possession ceased. The
pannel was thence forward in the lawful possession for him∣self;
and when he converts it to his own uses, from a pur∣pose
which is only afterwards taken up, and is probably sug∣gested
by his command of the thing, he cannot be held to
have taken it from the owner; since, without any wrong or
felonious intention, he already had it. To consider the
thing as returned into the hand of the owner, from the time
when the use to which it was given had determined, where∣by
the after-conversion of it to the holder's profit might fall
to be deemed a new taking from the owner; this, though
adopted by some authorities, seems to be a pure artificial,
<PB N="63" REF="120"/>
and indeed unnatural view of the situation, and such as
ought not to have any countenance from the law, because
tending to equalise the guilt of two acts, which in them∣selves
are of different degrees, and ought to be chastised
with unequal pains. In as much as his depravity, or at least
boldness, is not so great, who is only tempted to keep a
thing, which is already in his hands, and which came fair∣ly
into them, compared with that of the person who exerts
his invention, or makes venture of his person, feloniously
to withdraw the thing from the care and keeping of the
owner.</P>
<P>THE distinction between the two sorts of act will better
appear, if we add but one circumstance to any of these cases,
the more clearly to show that the purpose of lucre was not
the original inducement of the contract, but a new purpose,
which only arose after delivery of the thing. As for in∣stance,
if the holder of the hired horse be taken with per∣sonal
diligence upon his journey, and sell the horse to his
creditor, to relieve his person, and receive and spend the ba∣lance
of the price. Yet this is not a fundamental alteration
of the case, but matter of evidence only, to establish that
the dishonest purpose has but lately been taken up; a thing,
which if the offender gets the subject on any common con∣tract,
must be presumed in his favour, till proof be made,
by circumstances, that he from the first intended to defraud.</P>
<P>3. IF this be true of these situations, still less can there be
any doubt of such, wherein the whole wrong lies only in the
failure to re-deliver the thing, according to contract or pro∣mise:
As in the case of a thing lent me, to be returned by a
certain day, if I keep it longer; or in the case of a horse
hired to a certain place, if I ride it farther in the same di∣rection;
or in the case of the carrier, if he keep up the pack
<PB N="64" REF="121"/>
of goods, but unbroken, and without concealment, after his
arrival at their place of destination. Were it nothing more,
there is this objection to the charge of theft in these situations,
that the circumstances do not yield that decisive evidence,
which cannot be dispensed with, of the holder's purpose to ap∣propriate
the thing to himself. The definition of theft in the
civil law, <HI>L.</HI> 1. No. 3. <HI>Dig. de furtis,</HI> does indeed reach any
usurpation even of the use or possession of the thing; but this
can be no rule for our practice, in which the pains of theft
are not patrimonial only, as in the Roman, but reach the
person, and even the life of the offender.</P>
<P>4. THE same principle which protects the trespasser in the
case of delivery to him for some limited and temporary use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Trust.</NOTE>
will more strongly apply in his favour, in proportion as he
has the thing upon a higher interest of his own, and by a
contract which was meant to vest him with a fuller manage∣ment
and command of it. A creditor, who has his debtor's
property lying in pledge with him, is not guilty of theft if
he shall irregularly use or sell it; for such is his interest in
the thing, that the owner would be guilty of a crime, and as
some allege, would even be guilty of theft in certain cir∣cumstances,
if he should secretly withdraw it from his pos∣session.
Another apt illustration may be in that sort of in∣terest,
which a hired servant hath in the clothes and habili∣ments
of his body, furnished him by his master; which ar∣ticles,
though they are not the servant's property, (since the
master may insist that he shall leave them at quitting his
service), are, however, far more proper to him than his
master's plate, or other things committed to his keeping,
and belong to him by such a right, as shall at least hinder
any prosecution of him as a thief, if either he shall run off
<PB N="65" REF="122"/>
with them upon him, or shall sell them while in the service.
This point was tried with us in the case of Alexander Steill,
against whom it was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. 1669.</NOTE> that beside money and wri∣tings,
he had carried off certain arms and articles of wear∣ing
apparel, the property of Captain Barclay. It was
stated in defence, That the pannel was Captain Barc∣lay's
servant, and received his master's clothes and o∣ther
necessary furniture, to which he need prove no other
right, than by his having the delivery and use of the ar∣ticles;
and that to make a relevant charge, the pursuer
must specify a theftuous contrectation of the clothes, as by
withdrawing them from his master's study, cabinet, or
trunks.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sir George Lockhart pleads for the pannell, “That although the dittay were more special, yet the famen cannot be put to the knowledge of an inquest, be∣cause as to the species of the particular goods condescended on in the pannell's ex∣culpation, his intromission therewith can import no <HI>theft.</HI> In respect it is offer∣ed to be proven, that the pannell, being servant to Captain Barclay, did actually wear and make use of the said cloaths and goods during that year of his ser∣vice; and whilk using of the samen is sufficient to infer a right thereto, with∣out necessity to prove it otherwise, and beyond all question is sufficient to purge all theftuous contrectation, although the pannell had intromitted and car∣ried them away; there being nothing more ordinary than for servants during their master's service to get cloaths and other sicklike furniture, and it were most absurd and unjust, that servants making use thereof should not be such ane qualification of the right and possession, as though they did carry them away, it cannot infer the crime of theft against them.” He afterwards adds in a reply, “The libel must be circumstantiate, that it must convincingly appear, that the pannell's intromission was not warranted by ane preceeding delivery; but was a clear theftuous contrectation, as for example by proving that the goods lybelled, the time of the pannell's intromission, were in such way and manner in Captain Barclay's possession, as being in his trunks, cabinets and studies, as does clearly make out his right thereto.”</NOTE>. The Court sustained the charge with respect to
the writs and money; “and as to that article of the dittay,
anent the stealing of cloaths and arms, finds the same not
<PB N="66" REF="123"/>
relevant, except it be qualified specially, that he stole
these goods such a-day, forth of the house of Auchreddie,
and that they belonged to Captain Barclay, and were in
his possession, and that the same were stolen by breaking
of doors, chests, or trunks.”</P>
<P>UNDER the same rule falls the case of a factor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Trust.</NOTE> who runs
off with his employer's rents, after receiving them from the
tenants, or even, (which is stronger), the case of an over∣seer
or steward, entrusted with the management of a farm,
who privately disposes of the grain and other commodities,
the produce of the land, and receives the price to his own
behoof. The wrong of this proceeding does not lie in the
disposal of the things; for this falls under the powers of the
steward's office: Neither will the clandestine manner of
disposal make it theft, or a taking from his master, who has
put the produce out of his own hands, into those of the
steward, to be by him administred at his discretion, so he
faithfully account for the value. It is, therefore, in the
short accounting, and concealment of his receipts, not in
the withdrawing of the species or <HI>corpus,</HI> that the guilt of
such a trespass lies, which, though criminal, is however on∣ly
a fraud, or breach of trust, and a distinct offence from
thest. Such a charge had been brought by the Earl of Rose∣berry
against his steward Archibald Tait, before the Justices
of West-Lothian, who gave sentence for pillory and banish∣ment.
Which being challenged by Tait in a suspension,
among other reasons urged was this, That the Justices were
not competent to try a charge of theft. The Court found,
“That the libel or complaint brought by the Earl of Rose∣berry
and the procurator-fiscal against the said Archibald
Tait,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. 1776.</NOTE> before the Justices of Peace of the county of Lin∣lithgow,
<PB N="67" REF="124"/>
did not contain a charge of theft, but a charge
of fraudulent concealments of the proceeds of his matter's
goods, and by false contrivances endeavouring to prevent
these proceeds from coming to his master's knowledge;
find that such charge was competent to be tried by the Ju∣stices
without a jury.”</P>
<P>IN general, it seems to be true of all persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Trust.</NOTE> who are in
a responsible state as officers, and are entrusted not with the
care only, but the proper possession of money, such as cashiers
and tellers of banks, collectors of taxes or parochial rates,
treasurers of bodies corporate, judicial factors and the like,
that they are not punishable <HI>as thieves,</HI> but as criminals of
an inferior order, for any dishonesty or malversation in
their charge. It is implied in the nature of such appoint∣ments,
that the officer has more or less an administra∣tion,
a discretionary power, over the cash in his hands, with
which he is trusted in the mean time, upon his contract with
his employer, and in reliance on the surety which he has
found to be faithful; so that his obligation is not like that
of a mere hand, for the money received as a special <HI>corpus,</HI>
to be made forthcoming in the individual, and which is held
to be already in the possession of his master through him,
but for a just account of his receipts in general, to which he
may also be compelled by a civil action. The Roman law
says, with respect to a situation of this sort, “<HI>Siquis pecu∣niam
ita deposuerit, ut neque clausam, neque obsignatam, sed nu∣meratam
tradiderit; quo casu nihil aliud eum debere (accipien∣dum
est) apud quem deposita est, nisi tantundem pecuniae solvere.</HI>”
On this principle went the judgment for arbitrary pain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26. and Mar. 2. 1705.</NOTE> in
the case of Robert Pringle, the teller of a bank, who was
<PB N="68" REF="125"/>
convicted of embezzling the money under his charge, to a
considerable amount<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The like judgment was given in England, in the case of John Waite, cashier to the Bank of England, who had abstracted and sold six East India bonds, the property of the Bank, and entrusted to his keeping. At the Old Bailey, before Mr Baron Reynolds, in February 1743. But by that judgment the offence does not seem to have been considered as the ground of a criminal charge of any sort, but only of a civil action. See Leach's Cases in Crown Law; No. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. THE cases which have now been put,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Failure to re∣store Things found.</NOTE> are all such in
which the offender got the thing by the act and will of
the owner. But it seems to be an equally available de∣fence,
if the thing came to him, though against the owner's
will, in any lawful and warrantable manner, without <HI>tort</HI> or
transgression on his part in the apprehending of it. A land∣holder
finds a stray animal in his field, or a treasure in his
grounds, or has wrecked goods thrown in upon his shore;
or a passenger finds a pocket-book upon the highway, which
has the owner's name marked in it; or a hackney-coach∣man
finds a parcel in his coach, which was left there by
such a passenger, whom he some time before set down. It
seems not to be a theft in any of these cases, if the holder,
yielding to the opportunity and temptation, shall hide this
thing, which however does not in any of these cases be∣long
to him, and keep it to himself: And for this reason,
that there was no felonious intention, nor even so much as
a <HI>trespass</HI> in the first occupying of the thing, which was ly∣ing
vacant, and out of the power of the owner, who knew
not where it was, and might lawfully be taken into the pos∣session
of the finder, for the sake of custody, or till offer of
a reward.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The contrary seems to have been found with respect to the coachman, in the English case of William Wynne; but on principles which probably would not be followed in our practice. Leach's Cases, No. 168.</NOTE>. This is so much the case, that though caught
<PB N="69" REF="126"/>
in the very act of occupying the thing, he could not have been
challenged, nor made liable to any censure. In this, there∣fore,
as in some former instances, the wrong does not enter
deep into the case, but consists in the failure of social duty,
as to the restitution of the thing, or the giving of the due
notices, whereby the owner, or he who hath right, may
come to the knowledge of his property.</P>
<P>IT is no doubt true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment of Treasure.</NOTE> that in some of our antient treatises,
the concealer of a waif is ordered to be dealt with as a
thief, and the <HI>occultatio thesauri inventi</HI> is spoken of as not on∣ly
a theft, but a fort of treason. But it is obvious that these
views, (which at any rate no longer govern our practice,
and I know not if they ever did), were not drawn from the
nature of the fact, but are strained and artificial notions,
which were taken up for the more effectual protection of the
Crown's interest, in these articles so peculiarly exposed to
invasion, and hardly possible to be thoroughly defended<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In a list of cases tried before the Magistrates of Edinburgh, and subjoined to the information against Ludovick Campbell, in January 1730, I find the trial of Bailie Roger Hogg, for hidden treasure found in an old land in the town, 16th April 1724. This is the only vestige I have found of any charge of this fort.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN all situations of this kind, it is however essential, that
the thing, at the time of taking it, have in a full and proper
sense been out of the owner's possession. For, if I see my
neighbour's sheep break through our common fence, and
mingle with my flock, and I instantly drive off the flock to
another quarter of the country, and efface my neighbour's
mark, this seems to be nothing less than theft. Though in
my field for the instant, the sheep are not in any proper sense
out of the possession of my neighbour: It is rather to
he held that I for the first time take them out of it, when I
<PB N="70" REF="127"/>
drive off the flock, so as to remove them out of his probable
recovery. It might be more difficult, if the stray sheep should
remain for many days among mine unobserved, and be there
tended in my pastures along with mine, because I should here
be in possession, not only without any wrong on my part, but
even without my own knowledge.</P>
<P>THUS far in illustration of that side of the question which
is favourable to the pannel. It is no less necessary to guard
our rule on the other part, and to point out those situations,
in which the wrong will, in the estimation of law, amount
to theft, notwithstanding circumstances, which at first might
seem to lead to a milder construction.</P>
<P>1. IT is not to be understood that the offence ceases to
be theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Theft, though thing exposed to the Thief.</NOTE> because the owner has exposed the thing to a
risk of being stolen, and in this sense has put it under the
offender's power; for this may very well happen, and
yet the offender may not, in any proper sense, have been
made keeper of the thing, even for the time; not to men∣tion
that it were very dangerous to put property out of the
protection of the law in situations of this sort, which are
frequent and unavoidable in the daily intercourse and busi∣ness
of life. A shopkeeper produces his goods to one who
enquires for them, as if to buy, and the pretended customer
runs off with them, as soon as they are put into his hands;
or a person gallops off with a horse, which he has got upon
in public market, under the pretence of trying his paces; or
under pretence of giving change for a bank-note to one
who asks for it in public market, a cheat gets the note into his
hand, and instantly runs off. It seems to be very plain, that
in any of these cases, the crime is theft. For in no one of
them does the owner repose any voluntary or proper trust
in the stranger, or mean to venture his property for any
<PB N="71" REF="128"/>
time, how short soever, out of his own immediate care and
personal keeping; in which it still continues to be, though
put into the hand of another, under the owner's eye. And
as little doubt will there be of his case, who pockets the
spoons at an ordinary where he dines, or takes off and packs
up the sheets from the bed of a chamber where he has lain;
for in either case he has only the special use of that thing:
The possession, the care and charge of it, are with the ma∣ster
of the house, under whose keeping and protection it has
constantly remained.</P>
<P>2. IT seems likewise to be the better opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Custodiar of a Thing, can he steal it.</NOTE> that the
same shall hold of those very frequent and ordinary situa∣tions,
where, though in some sense a trust is given, that is
as far as relates to the care and custody of the thing for
particular uses, yet the constructive possession of it in the
opinion of law is with the owner, and not with the imme∣diate
keeper, who only holds it as a hand, in the name,
and for behoof, of his employer. Such is the case of the
butler stealing the plate, or the groom stealing the horses,
or the shepherd the sheep, which are entrusted to his keep∣ing.
The servant has not in any of these cases any sort of
property or interest in the thing, or any power of disposal
or administration of it, (as a factor or overseer hath), but
only the naked custody and detention of it in a state of ac∣cessibility
to the master, who can arrange the keeping of it
for his own uses in no other way, and out of which state,
thus natural to the thing, when the servant removes it; it is
therefore a proper <HI>taking</HI> from the possession of the master;
that is, a theft. By the master's commitment of it to the
servant, there was no change of lawful possession, no alte∣ration
nor decrease of his full command of the thing, in so
<PB N="72" REF="129"/>
much that it could not be arrested in the servant's hands
for the master's debt; and as in case of its being abstracted
from the servant by any stranger, it would nevertheless be
held to be taken out of the master's possession, who alone
could sue for recovery of it, so must the same be held when
the servant himself removes it, or is art and part with stran∣gers,
who do so.</P>
<P>THE contrary doctrine was strenuously urged in the case
of Margaret Heartside,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 31. June 1. Aug. 10. 1608.</NOTE> an attendant of the Queen, who was
charged with the theft of sundry jewels, her Majesty's pro∣perty,
and of considerable value, of which she had the keep∣ing.
But the Court repelled her defences, and sent the libel
as it stood, bearing a charge of theft only, to an assize<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The justice, with the advice of his assessors, finds the lybel and dittay re∣levant, nochtwithstanding of the haill exceptions proponit be the pannell; quairu pon my Lord Advocate askit instruments.”</NOTE>.
It is true, that though unsuccessful with the Court, this plea
prevailed with the jury, who acquitted her of the theft, and
found her only guilty “of the unlawful and undutiful sub∣stracting
and detaining:” But in matter of law the opi∣nion
of the Court is more to be regarded. She had sentence,
as was not unusual at that time, under authority of a letter
from the King, which indirectly blames the assize for ac∣quitting
of the theft, and bears, that his Majesty “accounts
her fact as infamous as if it had been done by direct
stealth,” and therefore banishes her to the isles of Ork∣ney,
for her lifetime. It appears, however, that she was
recalled in 1619, reponed against the sentence of infamy,
and reinstated in her place.</P>
<P>3. IF this doctrine be just of such situations as these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Servant or Clerk, steal∣ing Things sent by him.</NOTE> in
which the offender has the constant care and charge of the
particular thing which he has carried off, much more must
<PB N="73" REF="130"/>
the same hold good, if he has the thing only by an occa∣sional
employment, or on a special and instant errand; as
in the case of a porter at the post-office, who receives a let∣ter,
with money inclosed, to be delivered according to the
address; or the case of a banker's clerk, who is sent with a
sum of money, to be instantly paid at such a house; or in
the case of any tradesman's servant, who is sent with an ar∣ticle,
to be delivered to a customer. It seems to be at least
equally true in all these situations, as in any of the former,
that the present holder of the thing has no manner of inte∣rest
in it, and is to be regarded only as the instrument of
his employer, in whose possession the article remains until
such time as it be delivered to the use whereto he hath sent
it, in like manner as if it were only sent from one apartment
of the office or counting house to another. More especially,
in the first of these cases, the porter hath no sort of con∣cern
with the <HI>money,</HI> but a charge only over the <HI>letter,</HI> duly
to deliver it. And it is no less clear with respect to the
banker's clerk, that his master may countermand him, and
alter the destination of the money at pleasure, as long as it
is in the hands of the clerk.</P>
<P>OUR practice, accordingly, though it cannot be said to
have attained to the same certainty in this department as
that of England, where such questions have been settled by
frequent trial<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In the case of Thomas Hassell, a forter of letters at the Post-office, tried at the Old Bailey on the 16th October 1730, before Lord Chief-Justice Raymond, and other Judges, the Court were unanimously of opinion, that it was felony without benefit of clergy, for him to steal money out of a letter entrusted to him in his office. Leach's Cases, No. 1.</P>
<P>At the Old Bailey, in July session 1774, Timothy Skutt, a sorter of letters at the Post-office, was convicted of larceny at common law, for stealing money out of two letters, which had come into his hands as forter. <HI>Idem,</HI> No. 61.</P>
<P>In the case of the King against Paradise, tried before Mr Justice Gould at the assizes for Salisbury, that Judge was of opinion, that a banker's clerk who ran off with bills to the amount of L. 1500, which his master had given him to en∣close and dispatch by post, was guilty of larceny. The twelve Judges, being af∣terwards consulted, were of the same opinion. <HI>Idem,</HI> p. 420.</P>
<P>At the Old Bailey, in May 1782, William Bass was convicted of larceny, ha∣ving opened a package, with which his master, a gauze weaver, had sent him to a customer. The twelve Judges being consulted, were all of opinion that the conviction was right. <HI>Idem,</HI> No. 115.</P></NOTE>, seems, however, as far as it has gone, to
<PB N="74" REF="131"/>
have proceeded upon these views. Thus libel was sustained
for theft against James Shand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 27. and Dec. 11. 1704.</NOTE> a taylor's workman, for run∣ning
off from his master's house with a suit of clothes, which
had been entrusted to his master, to make. In the case also
of William Fairbairn, who was prosecuted as a thief in an
inferior court, for abstracting from the corn which he was
employed to thresh in the owner's barn, no exception was
taken to the form of charge, though advocation of the pro∣cess
was tried upon various other grounds in law, all of
which were strenuously urged<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This was the outset of the libel, “Where, by all law both human and divine, the stealing or taking away any person's property without the knowledge or consent of the owners, is a crime of a heineous nature, and severely punish∣able, more especially when committed in breach of trust and confidence.”</P>
<P>Libel was raised for theft against William Watt, 16th February 1779, clerk in a banking house, for running off with bills and money, given him by the cashier for a certain purpose. But the prisoner having contented to be banished, the case never came to trial.</P></NOTE>. The bill was refused on
the 26th July 1787. Farther, which is more express, in
the case of Daniel Mackay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 6. 1781.</NOTE> assistant-porter at the Post-office,
and of Adam Johnston, post-master of Moffat, in both
of which the libel was for stealing money out of letters en∣trusted
to them in these capacities, and was laid at common
law, as well as upon a statute in that behalf, an indiscri∣minate
<PB N="75" REF="132"/>
relevancy was found upon the charge as laid; and
this after debate in the last case, on the objection that the
offence, at common law, could not amount to more than
breach of trust. The pannels were convicted, and had sen∣tence
of death. Likewise, Peter Mathieson, an engraver's
apprentice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. 1789.</NOTE> for stealing seals and gravers tools from his
master, was transported for fourteen years, (the prosecutor,
on his confession, having restricted the libel to an arbitrary
pain), upon a libel which bore the charge of theft, aggrava∣ted
by the pannel's state, as an apprentice.</P>
<P>HAVING said so much of these cases, I need hardly remark,
that the pannel has no plea in those far less favourable situ∣ations,
where there has not been any commitment of the
particular thing to him, but only an advantage or oppor∣tunity
to steal given him, by reason of his station. As
if a servant open his master's repositories with the keys
which he has found in the house, mislaid, or if being sent
by his master with the key to fetch a particular thing from
a locked place, he take and secrete some other article; or
if the groom steal plate from the butler's pantry, or the
butler take a horse from the stable.</P>
<P>A MORE difficult set of cases than any of the above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Thing got in hire, &amp;c. with intent to take away.</NOTE> and con∣cerning
which still less information is to be obtained from
the records of our Criminal Court, are those in which the
prisoner obtains the thing by means of a trick and false
pretence, and upon some inferior title to that of property,
and has no other purpose, at the time of obtaining it, but
to cheat the owner, and turn the thing to his own pro∣fit.
An example of this may be, If a person under a false
name, and a false pretence of business, shall hire a horse to
<PB N="74" REF="133"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="75" REF="134"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="76" REF="135"/>
ride to a certain place, and return the same day; instead of
which he instantly rides the horse as hard as he can go, to
a great distance, and in a different direction, and there sells
him, and pockets the price. Or if a person goes from door
to door, asking employment as a bleacher, and getting linen
to be bleached and returned, and shewing a false letter of
recommendation, when in truth he is not, nor ever was a
person of that trade; and having got the linen, he instantly
packs it up, and flies. Is the offender here guilty of theft,
or only of fraud?</P>
<P>IT is to be observed of such situations, that they differ in
several respects from those, seemingly analogous cases, which
were formerly considered. First, the thing is not obtained
upon a contract of sale, or other habile title for the convey∣ance
of <HI>property,</HI> but upon a lower and limited title, under
which, if it were even fair and unexceptionable, the holder
would not have any right to dispose of the thing, nor to turn
the value of it into his own pocket. So far from it, that even
on this supposition, any stranger who should <HI>bona fide</HI> buy,
pay for and receive this thing from the holder, would not
thereby make it his own, but would be liable, in like man∣ner
as his author, to the owner's real action for recovery of
his property. When the holder assumes any such power of do∣minion,
it is therefore an unwarrantable and absolutely vici∣ous
conversion of the thing to his own use, wherein he has
not the colour of a title, and is in truth guilty of a double
wrong, having gained the very custody of the thing by
a trick, and arrogating the disposal to himself, without the
appearance even of the owner's will. Whereas in the case
of a swindling purchase upon credit, the holder has obtained
such a title, by which the property of the thing in the mean
time passeth, and in using, selling, or even destroying the
<PB N="77" REF="136"/>
thing, he does no more than exercise the powers appendant
to that title; so that the wrong in this case does not lie in
the after conversion of the commodity to his own uses,
without consent of the last owner, but in the false in∣ducements
by which that consent was gained.</P>
<P>AGAIN;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Thing hired with intent to take away.</NOTE> in this, the situation is different from that of a
swindling purchase, that the seller has the means of absolute∣ly
securing his interest if he please. He may either sell for
credit or for ready money, and if he sell for credit, it is out of
a voluntary trust, which he reposes in his customer, where∣by
he hath the less reason of complaint if he shall be decei∣ved,
and can only expect those remedies which are suitable
to a breach of trust. But, in the cases which are now in
hand, the owner hath no such choice nor means of absolute
security, but must necessarily deal as he has done. This risk
of the property which is parted with in hire, or to be worked
upon, or the like, is concomitant of the very nature of these
useful and necessary contracts, and cannot be separated from
them; so that the more necessary it is, (and this considera∣tion
never is indifferent in criminal matters), that a sufficient
protection be provided in the pains which the law denounces
against transgressors.</P>
<P>FATHER; there is this very material, and withal obvious
distinction, between the situations of hiring and the like, now
and formerly imagined, that the felonious purpose is now
supposed to be coeval with the very act of receiving the thing,
and to be that which alone has suggested to the pannnel to
ask it of the owner; whereas we had formerly put the case
thus, that the thing was at first obtained upon a just and
<HI>bona fide</HI> contract of hiring and so forth, and with a true in∣tention
on the part of the pannel, as at that time, to restore it
<PB N="78" REF="137"/>
according to promise. By the delivery, therefore, made in
pursuance of such contract, the owner's lawful possession
ceased and determined, and the abuse of the trust afterwards,
though criminal, cannot, however, amount to theft in the re∣ceiver
of the thing, since before the conception of any wrong
purpose, the thing had already passed into his power and en∣tire
possession, by a lawful taking. On the contrary, with
respect to the present case, in which there is truly no con∣tract
or <HI>consensus in idem placitum</HI> between the parties at all,
but a purpose of letting to hire in the one party, and a pur∣pose
to appropriate without payment, or an <HI>animus furandi</HI> in
the other, which exists at the moment of getting the thing, and
is the one original motive of the whole transaction, the just
and natural construction rather seems to be, that the owner's
lawful possession remains unaltered notwithstanding this de∣livery,
thus proceeding on the receiver's felonious purpose;
and that his conversion of the thing to his own uses is there∣fore
to be deemed a theft or <HI>tortious taking</HI> from the lawful
possession of the owner, in like manner as in the case of a
servant, who runs off with his master's goods. This result
too is not more agreeable to principles of law, than to
the natural feeling which one has with respect to the de∣gree
of the offence; for certainly on such an occasion
the very same villany is passing in the offender's thoughts
as in those of the thief, and the assurance, depravity, and
deliberate contrivance of such a device, by which the owner
is made the instrument of his own injury, is nowise infe∣rior
to that of an abstraction without his knowledge.</P>
<P>YET I shall not affirm that this is the law of Scotland:
Because I have found but one case, in which this important
question can be said to have been the subject of trial; I
mean the case of John Marshall, tried at Dumfries, before
<PB N="79" REF="138"/>
Lord Hailes on the 26th April 1792. This man had hi∣red
a horse at Sanquhar, to ride to Leadhills, a distance of
about ten miles, and return in the course of the same day.
Instead of which he rode directly to Edinburgh as fast as
the horse could go, and there sold it for his own behoof.
The charge in the libel was alternative, for fraud and
cheating, as well as theft. But the Judge delivered his opi∣nion,
that upon the fact as related in the libel, the offence
was theft; and the prosecutor in consequence, wishing to
avoid a capital conviction, found it necessary to restrict the
libel to an arbitrary pain. The man was convicted, and
adjudged to be transported for seven years.</P>
<P>THUS much of the taking which is essential to the crime of
theft. Upon the whole of which enquiry, before I entirely
dismiss it, it is proper to remark, that our practice has not
yet attained to sufficient maturity, and that a great part of
what has been advanced, is not to be considered as the re∣sult
of our adjudged cases, and other authorities, which are
few in number, but rather as an exposition of doctrines
which seem to be reasonable in themselves, and are in some
particulars recommended by the practice of England<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Judgment was given to that effect in these cases; John Tunnard, October 1729; George Charlewood, February 1786; John Pears, September 1779; all of them cases of a horse feloniously hired and sold, and upon the last of which, the opinion of the twelve Judges was taken, and was unanimous. Also in the case of Major Sempil, July 1786, for hiring and selling a carriage; and in that of John Wilkins, April 1789; and John Patch, February 1782; both of them cases of false device for getting hold of property, as upon some limited title; the offence was found to be felony, upon the general notion, that the owner could: not be divested of his lawful possession by a tortious taking. See Leach's Cases in Crown Law, p. 191; Case, 166; Case, 100; Case, 172; Case, 210;. Case, 110.</NOTE>;
which, though it is not of any authority with us as law,
<PB N="80" REF="139"/>
may, however, as far as it is grounded in just and natural
principles, meet with regard in the decision of such matters,
as our own custom or analogy of practice hath not settled.</P>
<P>II. THERE must not only be a taking of the thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Theft with∣out carrying away.</NOTE> but a
carrying away. For it seems to be in the nature of this
offence, (and any greater latitude of construction would
lead to controversy without end), that the thing have been
brought into a situation, in which it was less under the own∣er's
power and command than before. In general it is the
meaning of the rule, that the thing must be removed from
the place and state of keeping in which it had been, and that
without such an alteration, nothing done by the pannel, how
decisive soever of his felonious purpose, will amount to theft,
but to an attempt or misdemeanour only, which may be
greater or less, according to the circumstances of the fact.
A boy has his hand in my pocket, and has got hold of my
purse; but there I seize his hand, so that the purse is never
withdrawn from my pocket: This seems not to be theft. Nei∣ther
is it theft, if a vagabond passing make a snatch at linen on
the hedge, and it is held against him by the thorns; or hav∣ing
got into a waggon with intent to steal, if he raise a pack∣age
up, and set it on its end, but without removing it from
the place of the waggon where it had lain, and is there
caught, when about to cut the cords<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This was found by the twelve Judges of England, to be no sufficient aspor∣tation, p. 204. Leach's Cases.</P>
<P>A difficulty of this sort had been found in drawing the libel against Andrew Macewan, 10th August 1774. It related that two persons had entered a house in the day time, and made their way to a room where linens were lying on a bed. One of them had handed a shirt to his associate, and had laid hold of others, which, upon interruption, he was seen to throw back upon the bed; so that only one was <HI>taken,</HI> and that one neither concealed nor carried out of the room. The charge was therefore laid alternatively as for theft, or the entering of the houses of the lieges, <HI>with intention</HI> to steal, or the felonious taking of a shirt or shirts, or other goods their property. The pannel was transported on his own petition.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="140"/>
IT is not however by any means to be understood, that
there is no theft, unless the thing be carried clear away,
out of the sight or knowledge of the owner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a sufficient carrying away.</NOTE> so that he
knows not where to find it. Though the rhief be seen in
the very act of taking the thing, and be instantly and close∣ly
pursued, so that the owner has all along been in the near
prospect of recovering his property, the offence must never∣theless
be theft, for this very reason, that he has had the
thing to pursue for and recover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1686.</NOTE> Thus, in the case of Smith
and Forrester, this charge, among others, was found rele∣vant,
that they had laid hold of poultry in a close or court∣yard,
but being discovered, threw down the same, and fled<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And ye and your accomplices entered the close of William Simington, then and there laid hands upon his goose, to robb and steal the samin, but by reason of their noise and jangling, the people and servants having wakened, and come out in their shirts, they fand you in the fang, whereby you was forced to let the goose fall, and flee for your safety, but you the said Finlay Smith was taken.” This is the narrative of the libel.</NOTE>.
In that of Samuel Riccards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. and June 19, 20. 27. 1710.</NOTE> it was in like manner found
a good charge of robbery, (which is only a mode of
theft in the larger sense of the word), that he had run off
with a woman's plaid from her shoulders, which, on her
outcry, and a hot pursuit, he threw from him in the fields,
where it was instantly taken up by those who were upon his
footsteps.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there be but a very slight removal in respect
of place, it will also in every instance be a theft, if the
thing is thereby lost to the owner, so that he has to seek
<PB N="82" REF="141"/>
for and knows not where to find it, or in case of missing it,
would be under that necessity: For, how short soever the
time that this situation endures, it is quite a new and distinct
situation of the property and person, from that which they
were in before. Thus it will be theft in a servant to take
his master's purse from the table, or to unhook his watch
from the bed, though he be caught with it before he leave
the room, if it be found concealed in his clothes, or about
his person, in such a manner as proves his felonious inten∣tion.
As it would also be for any guest in an inn or ta∣vern,
to secret any piece of plate, linen, or the like, belong∣ing
to the house, in his chest, with intent to carry it away.</P>
<P>THERE seems to be as little doubt of this general direc∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a sufficient carrying away.</NOTE>
that it is always theft, if the thing is taken on of its
natural and proper place of keeping; not the place where it
accidentally happens to be, but that where for security
it had been put. Thus the crime is complete, as soon as
the horse is carried out of the stable, or the cattle out of
the inclosure, though the thief be stopped in the stable-yard
in the one case, or in the next field, being part of the same
farm, in the other. Accordingly, in the interlocutor of re∣levancy
in the case of William Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> the Court “<HI>separatim</HI>
find, That the goods libelled being stolen out of the said
house or waulk-mill, and their being found red hand in
the possession of the said pannel, <HI>coming out of the said
house,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death.”</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. 1782.</NOTE> Thomas Gordon had sentence of death
for sheep-stealing, on proof to this effect, that he had lifted
two sheep over the wall of the field, where they had been
at pasture, and had slaughtered and flead them behind the
wall, and was there taken, before removal of his booty.
<PB N="83" REF="142"/>
The slaughter was indeed a strong circumstance, taken along
with the others in the case; but if it had taken place with∣in
the field, would not of itself have grounded the charge
of theft, since it might have been done out of malice, and
without any purpose to carry off the carcase.</P>
<P>FOR the same reason which makes a removal from the
<HI>tenement</HI> sufficient in these cases, it is no less sufficient with
respect to any thing which has a peculiar and safe place of
keeping within the house, if it be once taken from thence,
with intent to carry it away. Under this rule my servant
is guilty of theft, when he takes money out of my bureau,
and the guest in an inn, when he forces the lock of any re∣pository
in his chamber, and takes out the contents, or one
who has entered a house, when he breaks up a chest, cup∣board,
or the like, and lays down the goods upon the floor<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was found to be felony in the case of Clement Simpson, at the Lent assizes for Cambridge, 16. Car. II. The opinion of all the Judges was taken out the case. Leach's Cases, p. 266.</NOTE>,
to be afterwards packed up and carried away. There is
a strong instance of this in the cafe of Alexander Snaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 1698.</NOTE> who
had sentence of death upon a libel and proof to this effect,
that he had entered a house, by means of a false key, upon
a Sunday, during divine service, and that having opened a
chest, by means of the key which he found in the lock, he
abstracted one article of very trifling value, with which he
was taken in that very chamber, by the people of the house,
returning from church<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Verdict, “Find Alexander Snaile, pannell, by his own confession, as also by the depositions of witnesses, guilty of opening the door of Mrs Douglas, her house, upon the Sabbath-day, the time of divine service, with a false key, and entering the said house, and taking out of a chest some butter; and that the keys produced in Court, and mentioned in his dittay, with the crooked irons, was then taken off him; as also a chissell, which was found, which he acknow∣ledged to be his, <HI>when he was taken prisoner in the said house.</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="143"/>
THE same principle equally applies to the stealing of such
things are kept in a certain manner about the person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a sufficient carrying away.</NOTE> where∣by
it is theft if the purse be taken out of the pocket, or the
watch drawn from the fob, or the ear-ring torn from the
ear<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A singular case of this sort was tried at the Old Bailey in May 1784. James Lapier had taken his stand at the door of the Opera-house, and seeing a lady, Mrs Hobart, passing to her carriage, he made a violent attempt to pull away a valuable ear-ring from her ear. The ear was torn through, and the ear-ring completely se∣parated from it, and the lady cried out that the man had got it; and he was taken. On going home, however, and at undressing, the ear-ring was found entangled in the curls of her hair. Nevertheless, as it had been violently forced from its due state of fastening to the person, and was for a time missing, the twelve Judges were of opinion, that his conviction of robbery was legal and good.—In like manner, at the Old Bailey, in February 1782, Henry Collet was convicted of larceny, having entered a waggon, and removed a parcel from the fore part of the waggon to the tail of it, where he was stopped, and threw back the parcel to the middle part of the waggon. Leach's Cases, No. 139. No. 108.</NOTE>. And in general it seems to be true, that if the state of
fixture in which the thing is by nature be altered, or if the
peculiar provisions, whatsoever, which the owner has made
for the safe-keeping of the thing, be once overcome, this,
joined with any the least removal of it in respect of place,
consummates the guilt. Hence it may seem that there is
ground for the charge, if wool be plucked from the sheep, or
fruit from the tree, or if a strong chest, which is fastened to
the floor, be unscrewed, and lifted ever so little out of its
place; or if a piece of cloth in a bleachfield is unpinned
from the ground, and rolled into a bale, which the thief has
taken up under his arm; or if he cut a web out of the loom
and fold it, or take a person's breeches with his money from
<PB N="85" REF="144"/>
under his pillow, as he sleeps, and be making off with them
out of the room. And even with respect to articles of that
nature, for which no such peculiar provision has been made,
any removal will be sufficient, that thoroughly alters the si∣tuation
in which the thing was left or happened to be, and is a
plain step in the conveyance of it out of the owner's power;
as if any loose article in a house is carried down from a
higher floor to a lower, or if a horse is taken in an open com∣mon,
and is haltered and mounted, and ridden away from
among the other cattle.</P>
<P>III. THE taking and carrying away must be with a felo∣nious
purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Theft with∣out felonious In∣tent.</NOTE> in the knowledge that the thing belongs to
a neighbour, and with intent to deprive him of his proper∣ty.
Hence, on the one hand, it is not theft, to take away
the property of another, though in the knowledge that it
is so, if the takers object is only irregular and improper,
and not to make the thing his own. It is an example of
this, that a servant rides his master's horse under night, up∣on
his own errand; or that a person finding his neighbour's
plough lying in the field, openly uses it to till his own lands
adjacent; or that he drives his neighbour's cattle into his
own field under night, in order to poind them, upon pretence
of trespass. On the other hand, neither will it be theft,
though the taker mean to dispose of the thing as his own,
if he take it in the belief, no matter though erroneous, if
serious, and withal excusable, that the thing is his own;
as may happen in many cases of disputed sale, legal dili∣gence,
succession, and other modes of conveyance. If John
carry off the goods of James by poinding, be the diligence
ever so irregular, nay, though John's proceedings be even
insidious and oppressive, still the taking in this form can
<PB N="86" REF="145"/>
never amount to theft or stouthrief, or other capital deno∣mination
of crime, but only to a spuilzie or oppression,
which may be punishable at the discretion of the Court.
Hence, of the many overstrained libels of this sort, to which
the proud and contentious spirit of the inhabitants of Scot∣land
formerly gave occasion, not one seems to have been
brought to a favourable issue, nor even to have had a clear
relevancy of capital pain pronounced on it. The ordinary
course in such cases was to continue the diet, till the ci∣vil
interest and regularity of the conveyance should be dis∣cussed
in the proper court<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the course taken in the case of James Adamson, 13th June 1677, accused of robbery, in the taking away of nine oxen; and who defended himself on the ground of <HI>lawfully poinded.</HI> In the case of Gilbert Stark and others, 30th November 1675, who pled the same defence against a charge of stouthrief, robbe∣ry and oppression, the Court assoilzied, on production of the diligence.</NOTE>. In the case of Graham of
Reidnock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9. 1636.</NOTE> prosecuted by the Laird of Buchanan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1637.</NOTE> for break∣ing
into his house, and carrying off certain writings and title∣deeds,
which appears to have been done upon mandate from
the old Laird of Buchanan, who conceived that he had right
to these deeds, “The Justices find the dittay relevant to
be put to the knowledge of an assize, as ane crime and
wrong of making up of the doors, and abstracting of the
evidents lybelled, nawayis to infer the pain and punish∣ment
of theft or stouthrief, but to be punished <HI>poena ar∣bitraria,</HI>
as ane crime and wrong in the awin kind.”</P>
<P>A CONTROVERSY had subsisted between Trotter of Mor∣tonhall
and Rigg of Morton, respecting the property of cer∣tain
parcels of ground. Rigg had cast the turf upon these
plots, and was proceeding to lay it on his bowling-green, in
which operation he was violently disturbed by a <HI>posse</HI> under
the orders of Trotter. This incident gave rise to mutual pro∣secutions;
<PB N="87" REF="146"/>
against Rigg for theft and robbery, in cutting
and carrying off the turf from Trotter's lands; against
Trotter for robbery, oppression, haime-sucken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in de∣stroying
Rigg's turf and bowling-green, tearing up the
new-turf in the green, (or <HI>green specificate,</HI> as it is called),
and troubling and beating his servants. The former was
found not relevant to infer any criminal conclusion; the
other was sustained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. and 15. 1714.</NOTE> as for a riotous molestation and outrage
only, to infer arbitrary pain, damages and expences.</P>
<P>MUCH a-kin to this, were the mutual prosecutions for
robbery, theft and stouthrief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. and 9. 1713.</NOTE> between Sir William and Ludo∣vick
Gordon. Which were upon no higher ground than
this, that having met to settle accounts, they had quarrelled
upon the matter, and in a sort of scuffle, had each laid hold of
the writings belonging to the other. Both parties found it ne∣cessary
to depart from these high conclusions; and the jury
found neither of the libels proven. Many examples more
of the same completion might be given.</P>
<P>IT has been said, and is fit to be remarked, that it is ne∣cessary
the pannel be excusable for believing that the thing
which he has taken is his own. For as to that sort of belief,
if such it may be called, which is directly in the face of
law, and only comes of the violent passions of the man, or
his blind prejudices in his own favour, it is what the Judge
can have no consideration of, nor any of the lieges be al∣lowed
to entertain. A smuggler, therefore, if he break in∣to
the Custom-house, and take away goods, which have been
seized from him and condemned, is as much guilty of theft
and house-breaking, as if he broke into the house and took
away the goods of his neighbour.</P>
<P>IV. IT is said to be another qualification of the taking
and carrying away,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the taking be for lucre.</NOTE> that it is for the sake of lucre, and profit.
<PB N="88" REF="147"/>
But this article will require to be guarded and explained.
It is true, in the sense already explained, <HI>viz.</HI> that the thing
must be taken away with the purpose to detain it from the
owner. It is also true in this other sense, that libel will not
lie for theft, if, out of malice to the owner, the property is
destroyed in the place where it is seized, without being re∣moved;
which happens when a man's cattle are slaughtered
and left upon the spot in the field, or when a mob enter a
man's house, and break and deface his effects, without car∣rying
any article away. But it may require to be consi∣dered,
in the case of the property being once removed into
the full possession of the offender, whether it alters the de∣scription
of the offence, that instead of being used or turned
to profit, the thing is afterwards destroyed, and that this
indulgence of spite was even the first inducement to take the
thing away. In its own nature, the crime of theft seems to be
complete by the removal, and the thorough alteration of the
state of command over the thing, if this be made with the
purpose of never restoring it to the owner. Be the offen∣der's
object what it may, he is actually <HI>locupletior,</HI> and the
owner poorer, <HI>eo ipso,</HI> that he has the thing under his power, to
dispose of as he pleases: And if he coveted that power for
the sake of revenge, this neither hinders the taking away to
be such, nor even in any proper sense to be a taking for the
sake of lucre; since this gratification of his evil passions, is
to him a lucre and gain. He still has sought an advantage
to himself, and sought it by removing his neigbour's proper∣ty
out of the possession of his neighbour into his own. Ha∣ving
secured this advantage, he may either persist in his
original purpose of mischief, or change it for one of use and
profit, if he shall be so inclined: He has now the very same
discretion in that respect by his possession, which the owner
<PB N="89" REF="148"/>
formerly enjoyed by the same means. In case, therefore,
(if such a thing should happen), of a herd of cattle being
driven from the owner's lands to those of his enemy at a
distance, and only slaughtered when there settled in the cu∣stody
of his enemy, the charge of theft may seem to lie;
for it would have lain if he had been pursued and taken
on his way; and it is hardly to be thought that this can be
altered by any after event. The criterion, therefore, in
this question, rather lies in the want of removal of the
thing.</P>
<P>BUT however this may be,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus Lucri</HI> explained.</NOTE> it is certain, that in the ordi∣nary
case, the <HI>animus lucri</HI> is to be presumed from the act
itself of taking the thing away. If the offender knew at
the time what it was he took, he was actuated by the desire
of that thing, and if he knew it not, as happens in pocket∣picking,
and in stealing the mail, and if the thing prove to be
such as can be of no use to him, all that can be said is, that
the man has been deceived in his expectations; for take it
he did in the hope of profit, and in the belief that it was
worth having, and making venture of his person for. No
matter then what afterwards becomes of the thing, or with
what view he keep it, nay, though he do not keep it at all,
but destroy or throw it away, or even fall on some means
of reconveying it to the owner, the guilt still abideth with
him. The profit only, and not the profligacy of the enter∣prise
is thereby lessened, which last is determined by that
which is passing in the mind of the adventurer at the time
of taking, and not by those considerations, of fear, repen∣tance,
or prudence, which may afterwards come to affect
him.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="149"/>
IT is also to be understood, that if the thing be kept by
the taker,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus Lucri</HI> explained.</NOTE> it matters not what the motive of the keeping is,
whether merely to hoard, or with a view to consume the
thing, or what other advantage, real or conceived. Eve∣ry
object is <HI>lucre</HI> in the estimation of law, which tempts
a person to desire the <HI>keeping</HI> and possession of that which is
another's; though the thing is not of that nature to yield,
or be convertible to, pecuniary profit. If a criminal pur∣loin
from the Sheriff-clerk or Procurator fiscal, the docu∣ments
and evidences either of his own guilt or that of an
associate, surely this is to him a real lucre, and relatively
to the nature and use of the thing taken, he is as much
actuated by a selfish and irregular desire of gain, as he who
steals a bag of money. And probably it will be admitted,
with respect to a connoisseur, who should steal pictures or
medals for the pleasure of admiring them, or an anti∣quarian,
who should steal rare books or manuscripts for
his instruction, that neither of them would have a sound
defence in a court of justice. We shall afterwards see,
that we accordingly have precedents of libel sustained
for the stealing of a child; though the <HI>ordinary</HI> incite∣ment
to such a crime, must either be love conceived to the
child, or more probably hatred to its relations. In short,
as various as the pleasures are which a man may have in
possessing his own, so various are the sorts of lucre, which
the law will hold sufficient in this question, if on account of
them one should covet that which is another's.</P>
<P>V. ACCORDING to some authorities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the taking be clandestine.</NOTE> it ought also to be
added to the description of the crime, that the taking and
carrying away is secret and clandestine. And this may be
true, if we understand a clandestine taking as contradi∣stinguished
<PB N="91" REF="150"/>
only to a taking by main force, or by putting
in fear. But in any looser and more general sense, such as
would exclude all taking by surprise, or of a sudden; as if
a person snatch the hat from a man's head, or his watch
out of his hand, as he is carelessly holding it, or if he dart
into a shop and run off with goods from the counter in pre∣sence
of the owner; it does not seem to be a proper part of
the description of the crime, which in all these instances
seems rather to be theft than any thing else. For neither
is there any application here to the will of the owner, to
over-awe him, nor any compulsion by an overpowering
force, which seem to be the characters of robbery, but a
taking in such a way, which equally sets aside the owner's
will in the matter, as the most clandestine abstraction; since
the thing is gone, before he can use any means to detain it.
If, however, any sort of struggle ensues on the attempt, and
the purpose is only accomplished by violence or terror, the
case becomes then a case of robbery, notwithstanding the
first intention to take by surprise.</P>
<P>VI. WE are now come to the last article in the descrip∣tion
of this crime;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thing taken must be <HI>Res aliena.</HI></NOTE> which is that the thing taken be the
property of another: For I see no authority in our prac∣tice
to persuade me, that a person can in any case be
guilty of theft, though he may of some inferior wrong, by
irregularly taking that which is his own. It is not, how∣ever,
any hinderance of the charge of theft, that the pro∣perty
of the thing taken is uncertain or unknown, such as
the goods of a deceased, goods passing on commission, or a
waif or stray that is stolen from the finder. Indeed, a cer∣tain
latitude in this respect is indispensible to justice, in
the extended state of commerce and manifold transaction
<PB N="92" REF="151"/>
among men, which offers so many situations of this ambi∣guous
character, but in which there is nevertheless no rea∣son,
why the thing should be out of the ordinary protection
of the law. Hence, though any libel at a private instance
must set forth the pursuer's interest in the thing, and though
in all cases where it can conveniently be done, the property
is in use to be set forth, for the pannel's full information of
the nature of the charge against him, yet in indictment for
the public interest, whensoever there is any reason for it, it
will be sufficient that the charge is made in such a manner,
as shows that the thing did not belong to the pannel, neither
really nor by pretension, and that neither was it lying unoc∣cupied,
but in a state of lawful possession, for behoof of the
person who then had, or should afterwards acquire, a right
to it. Nor is there any sort of hardship here on the pannel,
who has it equally in his power under this, as any other
form of charge, to prove that the things are his own proper∣ty,
or that of others, by whose authority he took them; a proof
which it always lies on him the pannel to bring forward.</P>
<P>THE charge against Wilson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 1736.</NOTE> Hall and Robertson was,
that they had carried off “bank-notes in a pocket-book be∣longing
to the said James Stark, and gold and money <HI>in
his possession,</HI> to the value of L. 200 Sterling, less or more<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The person robbed in this case was collector of excise at Kirkcaldy, and the money taken from him was chiefly public money, the produce of a collection, upon which he had been employed.</NOTE>.”
Janet Johnston was indicted for stealing certain articles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. 1787.</NOTE> “the
property of James Marshall, <HI>or others of his family.</HI>” And
Macdonald and Jamieson for breaking into the shop of Alex∣ander
Macdougall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. 1770.</NOTE> and stealing goods from thence, “being
the property of Alexander Macdougall, <HI>or of some other per∣son,
to the prosecutor unknown.”</HI> The charge was sustained
<PB N="93" REF="152"/>
in all these instances, and in the last after exception taken
to it by the pannel.</P>
<P>IT is almost unnecessary to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Res universitatis</HI> may be stolen.</NOTE> that the charge of theft
is competent, without regard to the quality of the owner,
whether a private person, or his Majesty, a corporation, a
private society, a parish, or what else, or though the case
should be such, in which it is difficult to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix the precise de∣scription
of the owner, or the nature of the immediate inte∣rest
in the thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27. 1788.</NOTE> The money taken in Smith and Brodie's
case, and in that of Wilson and Hall, was part of the royal
revenue. On the 6th of December 1556, Adam Sinclair and
Henry Elderlous had sentence of death for breaking into the
church of Forres, and stealing money, chalices, and church-ornaments.
On 21st May 1602, William Norvall, school∣master
of Cockpen, was banished for stealing from the ses∣sion-house,
the poors box of that parish, containing L. 8 of
the poors money. And in the spring circuit 1750, at Aber∣deen,
William Martin had sentence of death for the same
crime, having broken into a church, and stolen L. 11 of the
poors money. We are not subject, in such cases, to the same
difficulties, which seem to embarrass the English practice in
stating the property, and which, in some instances, have
constrained them to feign a property, where in strictness
there is none, (as in the case of a shroud taken out of the
grave, which is feigned to be the property of the relations
of the deceased), but will more reasonably be content with
such a description of the thing, as makes the possession or
administration of it clear, and excludes all title in the pan∣nel
to take it away.</P>
<P>VII. THESE seem to be the principal circumstances of the
description of the crime of theft.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft not pur∣ged by restoring thing or vaule.</NOTE> Which having once been
<PB N="94" REF="153"/>
committed by a proper taking and carrying away, can∣not
afterwards be undone in any course of conduct, not even
by early and voluntary restitution of the thing stolen, and
much less by payment of the value, or other atonement in
money. For what the law chiefly consfiders in this matter,
is not so much the damage to the individual, as the viola∣tion
of the order of civil society, by dishonesty prevailing
over right, and the danger of seduction, by the spectacle of this
as a practicable thing. Witness, in proof of this, the case of
John Watson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 3. 1663.</NOTE> who had sentence of death for stealing forty
sheep, notwithstanding his allegation, which does not seem to
be disputed, that he had already refunded “the worth of
them” to the owner. Witness also the case of Finlay
Macgibbon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2. and 3. 1669.</NOTE> for the theft of six horses, and that of Grizel So∣merville,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Macgibbon's case. “The Justice repels the defence proponed for the pan∣nell, and finds the dittay relevant, and ordains the same to pass,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He was accordingly convicted and executed.</P>
<P>Somerville's case. “Sustain the dittay as to the haill remanent articles of theft lybelled, relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to infer an arbitrary pain; … and repell the defence founded on restitution, and remitts.”</P></NOTE>,
in both of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1686.</NOTE> the defence of restitution of
the things themselves, and in the former, along with “ten
score merks for the skaith,” was specially repelled. In
the case too of Daniel Mackay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 6. 1781.</NOTE> a letter-carrier, who had
sentence of death for stealing L. 300 out of a letter, the whole
sum but L. 15 had been returned through the Post-office, to
the owner. Yet it may plausibly be maintained, though I
do not know of any judgment to that effect, that the private
party, who not only recovers his property, or the value of
it, (for which he cannot be blamed), but has also taken
theft-bute from the thief, shall not be allowed to prosecute;
since, in the construction of law, he is in that case himself
participant of the theft. But it is certain, that neither by
<PB N="95" REF="154"/>
this, nor any other measure of his, can he screen the cri∣minal
from punishment, or disappoint the course of public
justice; of which he hath no disposal.</P>
<P>VIII. Next;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Things whereof Theft may be committed.</NOTE> of the things, whereof theft may be commit∣ted.
In the law of England, theft is only of things perso∣nal,
and not of things real, or things which appertain to,
or favour of, the realty. Under this rule, there is no theft
with them at common law, of nursery plants, nor of growing
trees, nor of any of the growing fruits of the ground; nor of
hedge-paling, nor of lead, iron, or other thing united to
a house. As also the writings of any real estate, are not
subject of this crime; neither are bonds, bills, or other
choses in action; though for this a different reason is gi∣ven.
But to all these, (as we should esteem them) artificial di∣stinctions,
our practice has ever been a stranger, and recog∣nises
the theft of every inanimate thing, which can be se∣vered
from that, which either naturally, or by art, it is at∣tached
to, and be carried away. Thus, in the case of James
Inglis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE> relevancy was found on the tearing of wool from
sheep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 13. 1758.</NOTE> and carrying it away<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Long before this, sentence of death had passed upon James Gray, convicted of pulling wool from nine ewes, and stealing an ewe, and carrying off the wool which he had pulled; 17th March 1581. MS. Abs. Record, Adv. Libr.</NOTE>. And in that of James Miln,
accused of the several facts of stealing shorn grain, shearing
grass, and carrying it away, and pulling up growing pease,
and carrying them away, all of which were charged under
the name of theft only, the trial proceeded on that footing
as to the whole articles; and the man was transported. It
seems even to be the more probable opinion, according to
the analogy of what is settled, that the separating and car∣rying
away of part of the substance of the tenement itself,
<PB N="96" REF="155"/>
shall be judged by the same rule. It is true, that injuries of
this sort are ordinarily done in that open manner, and are ac∣companied
with those circumstances, which bear evidence of
a trespass only or molestation; but it seems to be only there
that the distinction lies. For if one come in the night-time
and work coal in his neighbour's pit, or stone in his quarry,
or feuel in his moss, and carry it away and hide it, this
seems to be just such an act as the cutting off the leaden
spouts, or tearing up the iron spikes of his house, which is
certainly theft.</P>
<P>WITH respect to writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is committed of Writings.</NOTE> the law has been settled against
the thief, by repeated judgments. As long ago as the 23d
June 1599, Grizel Mathew had sentence of death, for steal∣ing
a coffer with writs and evidents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 30. Ap. 1. &amp; 3. &amp; May 2. 1601.</NOTE> Also James and Wil∣liam
Wood, and Alexander Dow, had sentence of death, for
breaking into the house of Bonnington, and stealing the
whole writs and evidents of that estate, contained in a coffer,
together with certain articles of furniture, and another
coffer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 20. 1614.</NOTE> also containing writs. As had Patrick Eviot, con∣victed
of common theft, and of stealing a leather wallet,
whereof the principal contents were certain title-deeds,
which the owner was carrying, to obtain a charter of con∣firmation.
On the 6th November 1635, Michael Scott is
sent to an assize, on a charge of stealing certain bonds of
borrowed money from the owner's chest; but he is acquitted.
Relevancy is found to the same effect in these cases: Against
Alexander Steel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. 1669.</NOTE> for stealing three dispositions and charters
of the estate of Towie<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">The Justices “sand the dittay relevant as to that part anent the money <HI>and writs,</HI> as it is lybelled, <HI>viz.</HI> By breaking up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tuer's doors under cloud and silence of night, out of his dwelling-house of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>edie.”</NOTE>;—against; James Graham <HI>alias</HI> Gra∣moch<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 8 and July 1. 1717.</NOTE>

when collecting rents at Chappell-aroch, and taking
from him money or books, papers or accounts; and against
John Johnston for stealing a pocket-book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. 1786.</NOTE> containing bank∣notes,
“with several other papers of less value.” In this
case an objection was stated to the charge, and was over∣ruled.</P>
<P>IT may be thought a confirmation of the same doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Stealing the Mail.</NOTE>
that on the 3d July 1691, in the case of John Seton, libel
for robbing the mail, was found relevant to infer the pain
of death; which must have been upon the common law;
because, though the trial was after, the offence itself was be∣fore
the passing of the statute 1690, c. 3. <HI>against robbing of the
packet.</HI> This plea is therefore stated for the pannel, and
that to steal letters and papers, which are not objects of
lucre, is not theft at common law. In answer, the prosecu∣tor
maintains the contrary, and that the statute was only
explanatory of what had been law before. Likewise, in
later times, indictments for robbing or stealing from the mail,
have generally been laid upon the common law, as well as
upon the statutes of the 5th Geo. III. c. 25. and 7th Geo. III.
c. 50<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">By the first of these, it is death to rob the mail of any bag, packet or letter, though such robbery should appear not to be a taking from the person, nor on the highway, nor in a dwelling-house, nor by putting the person in fear. The same is enacted by the other with respect to the stealing of any bag, packet, or letter, out of the mail, or from any Post-office; and with respect to any servent of the Post-office secreting, embezzling, or destroying any bag or letter, which contains a bank note, bill, or other voucher for money, or taking such note or voucher out of a letter.</NOTE>. which have been passed to cut off all doubt respect∣ing
<PB N="98" REF="157"/>
any case, in a matter of such importance: Two in∣stances
of this were formerly mentioned; and a third, in
which too this part of the charge was objected to, is the
case of Charles and James Jamieson, who both had sentence
of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. 1786.</NOTE> for stealing a mail from the stable-yard of an
inn.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the stealing of animate things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft of Things animate.</NOTE> or living
creatures, certain distinctions must be made. Our practice
of course acknowledges the common exception of those ani∣mals
which are wild, and in no degree under dominion, such
as game in the fields, or fish in a lake or river, which there
may be a trespass in taking without leave of the owner of the
grounds, but which are not his property, to be stolen. And
though it be true, that our statutes of different periods have
punished the killing of beasts and fowl of certain sorts with
great severity, when done at certain seasons, or with certain
weapons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551, c. 9. 1567. c. 16. 1594, c. 214. 1597, c 270.</NOTE> at one time with death, afterwards with consis∣cation
of moveables, and at last with fine, and setting in the
stocks; yet none of these laws create a property in the heritor
of the grounds where the offence is done, nor make the tres∣pass
liable to prosecution at his peculiar instance, as owner
of the animals, or upon a charge of theft. Therefore, in the
only prosecution of this sort that appears in the record, that
of the Duke of Gordon and the Advocate against Ronald
Macdonald and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 17. &amp; 24. 1711.</NOTE> for killing of forty deer, which they
had driven, or which had strayed towards Lochlagan, from
<PB N="99" REF="158"/>
their pasture in the Duke's forrest of Benalder, the charge
is not laid as for theft<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor: “Finds the same as lybelled not relevant, at instance of the said Duke of Gordon; but sustain the same relevant to infer a pecuniary n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ict against the pannells.” It is ambiguous upon the libel, whether the deer were killed upon the Duke's grounds, or were driven from, or had strayed out of them. 24th December 1711.</NOTE>: Neither is it sustained at the
Duke's instance, but that of the Advocate only.</P>
<P>ON the other extreme, with respect to all domestic crea∣tures,
or creatures <HI>domitae naturae,</HI> such as horses, sheep, poul∣try
and the like, it is equally clear that these are the pro∣per
subjects of theft. And the same seems to be reasonable
with respect even to animals of a wild and unreclaimed na∣ture,
if so confined and kept that they cannot escape, and
may easily and at any time be caught, such as deer in a pen,
rabbits in a house, or young pigeons in a dovecote; being
then in nearly the same condition as their dead carcases
after slaughter, which may certainly be stolen. But between
these extremes, there lie a great number of more ambigu∣ous
situations, such as that of deer in a park, rabbits in a
warren, doves in a dovecote, fish in a stank or pond, with
respect to which it may not be certain what opinion our
Judges would have held, if the Legislature had not made
them the subject of special provisions; which declare that
the taking of these things, or even the shooting at deer, rabbit
or pigeon, without consent of the owner, shall be theft. The
chief of these are the acts 1474, c. 60.; 1535, c. 13.; 1587,
c. 59.; and 1579, c. 84.; which last declares, that in a person
who is not responsible with his goods, for the pecuniary pains,
the breaking of dovecotes, cunningaires or parks, may be
punished with death on the third fault, even by an infe∣rior
court. The acts 1535, c. 13. and 1555, c. 58. extend
<PB N="100" REF="159"/>
the same pains to the stealing of bee-hives, which indeed
seems to be of the nature of theft at common law. It is
true, that other statutes may be cited, such as the acts
1503; c. 69.; 1607, c. 3.; which appoint the transgressors
in these several ways to be punished only with pecuniary or
petty corporal pains, at least in certain cases. But notwith∣standing
this sort of variance, of which there are many
other instances in our statute-book, the clear result of the
whole seems to be the raising of these offences to the rank of
theft, and an authority for inflicting death in case of fla∣grant
and repeated guilt. Certain it is, that John Raitt and
Alexander Dean had sentence of death for breaking into
eight different gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. &amp; 25. 1623.</NOTE> and stealing garden-stuffs, and from
some of them bee-hives; but whether they were convicted
on these statutes, or on the common law as incorrigible
thieves, does not appear from the record.</P>
<P>IN the law of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft of Things animate.</NOTE> no larceny seems to be acknow∣ledged
of animals of a base nature, such as dogs, singing
birds, and other creatures, kept for whim or pleasure. This
may perhaps be more suitable to their system, in which the
pains are more definite, and which requires the value of the
thing to be set forth in the indictment, and distinguishes be∣tween
grand and petty larceny according to the amount of
the value, (whereas of such things there is no determinate
value, great or small), than it is to ours, where the Judge
has free discretion to proportion the pains to the whole cir∣cumstances,
whatsoever, of the case, and may six them as low
as he sees good. But on this I have found no precedent.
Special statute, 1474, c. 59. has interposed for the protection
of hawk and hound, and especially the former, “in respect
of the nobleness of its nature and use for princes and
<PB N="101" REF="160"/>
great men”<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 512.</NOTE>, and has forbidden to steal them, “maide
or wild, or out of nests,” or even to take the egg out of
the hawk's nest in another man's ground, under the penalty
of L. 10.</P>
<P>NOT to insist longer upon these.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stealing of hu∣man Creatures.</NOTE> The most interesting ar∣ticle
under this head of our enquiry relates to the stealing
of a human creature, the <HI>crimen plagii,</HI> as it was termed in
the Roman law. This might be committed, either by the
selling of a free man to be a slave, whereof the punishment
was capital,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xxi. 16.</NOTE> the same that is appointed by the divine law,
or by enticing, concealing, or buying the slave of another,
whereof the punishment was at first pecuniary, under the
<HI>lex Favia,</HI> and afterwards arbitrary, according to the degree
of the fault<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Dig. lib. 48. tit. 15. I. 1. 6. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RIGHTLY considered, the away-taking and vending, or
sending into captivity, of a person of grown years and mature
discretion, seems to be a crime of a distinct nature from
theft or robbery, and in nowise a patrimonial, but a proper
personal injury, and one of the highest sort. It cannot
fall under the notion of theft, by reason, if there were no
more in the case, of the circumstances of force and invasion
of the person, with which it must be accompanied. And
even to call it a robbery, seems to be a perversion, and a
figurative, rather than judicial use of the term; since the en∣tire
injury of such an act consists in the distress and suffering
of the person himself who is taken, and not in any damage
to others by the taking of him. It cannot therefore with
any more propriety be called a robbery, than even the mur∣der
<PB N="102" REF="161"/>
of him might be called so, by which his relations, me∣taphorically
may be said to be robbed of their kinsman. Ac∣cordingly,
I have not found any precedent of capital pain
inflicted for this offence under the notion of theft. The
light in which of old it was sometimes viewed, and even
this seems to be somewhat a strained and artificial notion,
(though it prevailed in England as well as here<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Blackst. vol. iv. p, 76.</NOTE>), was that
of a treasonable usurpation of the royal authority, in the de∣taining
of the King's free lieges, without his licence or
commission. This, in particular, is the form of the charge
against George Meldrum younger of Dumbreck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 12. 1604.</NOTE> who, beside
other offences, was accused of the invading, taking captive,
and conveying away of three persons; among whom was Gib∣son
of Durie, one of the clerks of the Court of Session, whom
he conveyed out of Fife, by Kinghorn, and Edinburgh,
through Lothian, and by Melrose, into England. Being con∣victed
of this charge, he had sentence of death and forfei∣ture,
which proceeds upon the special narrative, that this,
as well as certain other points of his dittay, were of a trea∣sonable
nature<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Finding the said crimes, <HI>viz.</HI> the taking and apprehending of the said three persons, our Sovraine Lord's free leiges, prisoners and captives, and detaining them in captivitie; and sicklike the said stouthrief of the foresaid twa pursis, and gold and silver being therein; and sicklike the taking of the said house of Dum∣breck, and keeping thereof, quairof the said George Meldrum was convict, <HI>to be treasonable,</HI> Be the mouth of Ro.

In the same form, the charge was laid and sustained in the case of the Viscount Frendraught,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4. 1664.</NOTE> ac∣cused
<PB N="103" REF="162"/>
of the wounding, carrying off, and at last murdering,
Alexander Gregory of Netherdale; though in the debate
the crime of <HI>plagium</HI> was mentioned, and the tests of the Ro∣man
law were referred to, as grounds of the libel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Libel: “As also by the laws and acts of Parliament of the kingdom, the taking and imprisoning of the lieges, without warrand, is a crime of a very high nature, to be punished as encroaching on his Majesty's power and royal authority.”</P>
<P>“The Justices sustains the dittay only art and part of the murder, and taking and incarcerating the King's free lieges.”</P></NOTE>. It
does not appear, that for more than a century past there
has been any conviction in the same sort<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lieutenant Mark Ker, and others, were pursued (23d November 1649), for the rapt and taking away of Ro. Cunninghame, a youth, as it appears, of fourteen or thereby, from the possession of his uncle, and tutor or curator, Harry Cunninghame. The libel was sent to an assize, after debate on the title of his, uncle to pursue, which was sustained. But in the end, (7th March 1650), the matter was remitted for trial to the Lords of Parliament.</NOTE>; and as no argu∣ment
can now be drawn from any similitude which the of∣fence
may have to treason, so a just ground may seem to be
wanting, especially if we consider the altered temper and
condition of the country, upon which to inflict the pains of
death for offences of this kind.</P>
<P>THE one case, therefore, which seems to be referrible to
this part of our subject, is the away-taking of an infant
child. For in this instance the creature taken, which has
no will of its own to be forced, is as a <HI>thing</HI> under the care
and in the possession of others, from whom it is taken, and
to whom, without any violence, it may be said, and in com∣mon
language is said, to belong, and to whom too the loss
and distress of the taking of it is, which the child itself does
not feel nor know. Neither is it an objection to this view
of the transgression, that the child cannot be taken away
<PB N="104" REF="163"/>
for the sake of profit. For, beside that the person of the
child may be, and sometimes is turned to profit in certain
ways, it is lucre in the estimation of law, that the child is
detained and kept. The detainer has therein that advan∣tage
and benefit, whatsoever it was, which he coveted in
taking the child away; and this, when reaped by custody
and keeping of the thing, not by instant destruction of it
without keeping or removal, is all the lucre which the law
requires, and makes the case as much a case of theft, if the
child were even stolen out of affection to itself, and much
more if out of enmity to the parents, as if a person should steal
a MS. from any one in a language to himself unknown, in or∣der
to distress him, or any other article on which he sets
a value, and which is useless to any but the owner. Now, if
there be no obstacle to the conception of the deed as a theft in
this point of view, much less is there any in the nature of it,
considered with relation to the wickedness of the offender, or
the distress and misery it occasions to the parents or near re∣lations
of the child, both of which are out of all compari∣son
greater, that in any other case of theft; not to mention
the danger and facility of this invasion of a creature, which
can make no resistance. Mackenzie hath accordingly said,
that with us, Aegyptians and others, stealing children, have
been punished with death. And of this there was a late
instance in the case of Margaret Irvine, tried and condem∣ned
at Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 24. 1784.</NOTE> by the Lords Hailes and Henderland, for
stealing an infant from its father's house at Edinburgh,
and travelling with it as a beggar, north to Aberdeen,
where, at the distance of a year, she was taken with it in
her possession<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The major of the libel, is in these words: “That albeit <HI>theft</HI> is a crime of a heinous nature, and severely punishable, especially that species of it called man-stealing or <HI>plagium,</HI> and when committed by stealing and carrying away an infant of tender years from its parents,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The jury recommended the wo∣man to mercy, in respect that the person of the child did not appear to have been abused; and it is believed that she obtained a transportation pardon.</NOTE>. The case too, reported in Maclaurin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. 61.</NOTE> of
<PB N="105" REF="164"/>
Jean Waldie and Helen Torrence, seems to be another in∣stance
in point. For the libel bore a double charge; one
of murdering the child and selling the body, the other of
stealing the child alive, and shortly after selling his dead
body; and the conviction, on which they had sentence of
death, seems to be in the precise terms of the second charge.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds them both guilty art and part of stealing John Dallas, a living child, and son of John Dallas, chairman in Edinburgh, from his father's house, at the time and in the manner libelled, and of carrying him to the house of Jean Wal∣die, one of the pannels; and soon thereafter, on the evening of the day libel∣led, of selling and delivering his body, then dead, to some surgeons and students of physick.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN regard to the raising of a dead body from the grave;
this cannot in any proper sense be regarded as a theft, but
may be prosecuted as a great indecency, and a crime of its
own sort, the <HI>crimen violati sepulcri.</HI> In that form it was ac∣cordingly
tried, and was punished with whipping and ba∣nishment,
in the case of John Samuel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. 1742.</NOTE> The English lawyers
seem to hold, that indictment will lie for theft, if the dead∣clothes
are stolen along with the body. But I have not found
any vestige of such an opinion with us.</P>
<P>IX. HAVING now gained some notion of the nature of
theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Punish∣ment of Theft.</NOTE> we proceed to consider the pains which law has ap∣pointed
for the transgressor. In entering upon this article,
much shall not be said in relation to the controversy, though
keenly agitated, respecting the justice or propriety of <HI>in
any case</HI> punishing a single act of theft with death. That
<PB N="106" REF="165"/>
such a controversy should subsist, may not indeed be won∣derful,
considering how light the owner's loss in any one in∣stance,
when weighed against the life of a man; and moved
by this humane view of the matter, many eminent lawyers,
among whom Mathaeus and Grotius, have loudly declared
against what seems to be the almost universal practice of
the nations of modern Europe. But that such is the com∣mon
practice of an improved age, and in the most enlight∣ened
quarter of the globe, seems to afford a strong presump∣tion,
that there are considerations of general policy, or ra∣ther
of necessity, on the other side, (if the peace, prosperity,
and good order of society are to be consulted), which are of
a nature too urgent and powerful, to let this scheme of mercy
be put in practice. And indeed, if we shall not take into
our view this of the character of crimes, with respect to their
influence on the tranquillity or other great interests of so∣ciety,
but think of establishing a scale of pains for all of∣fences,
in proportion to their wickedness and natural de∣formity,
it will not be in this one article of theft that the
reformation must be made, but almost the whole system of
punishments must be new modelled. As Hale<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 13.</NOTE> has justly
remarked, “when offences grow enormous, frequent and
dangerous to a state or kingdom, destructive or highly per∣nicious
to civil societies, and to the great insecurity and
danger of the kingdom and its inhabitants, severe punish∣ments,
even death itself, is necessary to be annexed to
laws in many cases, by the prudence of lawgivers, though
possibly beyond the single demerit of the offence itself,
simply considered.” It is true, that entirely to suppress
the evil, is not to be expected of this, nor of any other course
of treatment; but it is not therefore to be concluded, that
<PB N="107" REF="166"/>
the spectacle of this high and ultimate vengeance in such cases
is of no efficacy towards reclaiming the petty transgressor,
or guarding the young against the allurements of vice and
evil example, or in general, in heightening among the people
that respect for property, and that esteem of honest indu∣stry,
which are the great basis of the happiness and prospe∣rity
of civil life. Besides, it is to be remembered, that any
such lenity in the punishment of theft is not a matter which
has no relation to others, and may be arranged without re∣gard
to them, but, if any consistency is to be maintained in
the law, must be followed with the like relaxation in the
pains of forgery, and many other offences, which, like theft,
are only modes of patrimonial injury. If indeed this were
understood to be the universal rule of punishment for theft,
without regard to the small value of the thing taken, or
other the extenuating circumstances of the act, there might
be as little to say for such an order of things, in respect of
policy as of humanity. But among the many authorities
which touch upon this point, there is none that argues
for such excessive rigour, or carries the precept farther than
this, that a single act of theft may warrantably be punished
with death, <HI>si sit-admodum grave,</HI> if, taken in all its circum∣stances,
it is a great and serious offence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the practice of Scotland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of simple Theft.</NOTE> Though Mac∣kenzie
has treated of it at some length, it is not with that
order and precision which might be wished, nor is the gene∣ral
result of his discussion very easy to be gathered; though,
on the whole, this is observable, that his remarks on the
merciful side are rather the expression of his own sentiments
with respect to the course which things ought to have, and
what he says on the other is an account of the practice
<PB N="108" REF="167"/>
as it stands, and of the views which have actually govern∣ed
it.</P>
<P>THE conclusion that arises upon these, which alone are the
proper subjects of our attention, seems plainly to be this,
that as theft is not a crime of one fixed and invariable de∣gree
of guilt, but may either be a venial or a heinous offence,
according to the circumstances of the act, and the situation of
the culprit, so by ancient custom, grounded on this substantial
reason in the nature of the thing, our Judges have an equi∣table
discretion of attending to the whole particulars of
any case, and proportioning the sentence to the evil of the
example, and profligacy of the offender; whereby he in
some instances may escape very lightly, and in others shall
suffer the highest pains that are known to the law. That
is to say, if on attending to the value of the thing stolen,
the mode of the theft, qualities of the offender, and whole
case, the fact appears to be no more than a pickery, to which
he may have been betrayed by youth and opportunity; or
if it is of a higher, but still excusable description; or if it
marks a daring or practised offender; or is of such a kind,
that the example of it is very dangerous: I say, according
to these equitable considerations, the Court have power to
deal with the pannel, inflicting the capital pain for even,
one act of simple theft, if taken with all its qualities, it is
a <HI>furtum grave,</HI> and being bound to shew mercy, more or
less, if it is a mere pilfery, or less considerable theft; be∣cause
the course of practice hath been, to be tender in such
cases.</P>
<P>IN testitnony of this position,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of simple Theft.</NOTE> I may refer to one of the
oldest authorities in our law, the <HI>Leges Burgorum,</HI> which
speaking of him who is taken with a theft to the value of
<PB N="109" REF="168"/>
thirty-two pennies and a half, expressly order that he
be put to death “<HI>ab eo suspendatur a quo captus est</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. L. Burg. ch. 121. No. 6.</NOTE>.” In
like manner, our authentic statute-book, though it does not
contain any law, which declares, as upon a new matter, or by
way of general ordinance, that a thief shall be punished ca∣pitally,
yet in many places implies that such is his forfeit,
and cursorily and <HI>narrative</HI> speaks of <HI>the pains of theft and
death,</HI> as of thengs which were known to be one and the
same. The act 1579, c. 74. orders that a vagabond who de∣serts
his master, to whom the magistrate has bound him, and
returns to his vagrant courses, shall be adjudged and suffer
“<HI>the pains of death, as a thief.</HI>” The act 1581, c. 110. concern∣ing
the slayers and houghers of oxen, declares in the entrance
of the enacting part, that these offenders shall be esteemed
and punished <HI>as thieves.</HI>” It goes on to say, that such as
receive or maintain them, shall be esteemed and punished
<HI>as resetters and maintainers of thieves;</HI>” and it finishes with
an order as to both, that, “being duly called and convict
thereof, they shall incur <HI>the pain of death</HI> and confiscation
of all their gudes moovabil,” thus plainly assuming it as
a known thing, that such in law was the estimation and pu∣nishment
of a thief. The same thing is said in more direct
and concise form, by the act 1587, c. 83. which ordains that
destroyers of ploughs and plough-gear “shall be punished
therefor <HI>to the death, as thieves.</HI>”</P>
<P>THIS also is the conclusion which arises on comparison of
the statutes 1600, c. 11. and 1606, c. 5. against the slaying of
salmon in forbidden time. The first of these orders it to
be punished “<HI>as theft</HI> in every quality, according to the
committer's rank and estate;” and the other, which re∣cites
the former, and takes away the exception in it of cer∣tain:
<PB N="110" REF="169"/>
rivers, directs that the offenders in these rivers “shall
underlie the paines foresaid <HI>of thrift and death,</HI> according to
the quality, rank and estate of the committers thereof.”
Mention may also be made of the statute 1567, c. 21. which
prescribes with respect to thieves when taken, that they
shall be presented to the Justice and his deputes, “give their
takeris, havand power, <HI>justifye them not to the death,</HI> them∣selfis.”</P>
<P>THESE may suffice as a specimen of the language of our
statute-book on this subject;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of simple Theft.</NOTE> with which the construction
also of practice and custom entirely agrees. Not that in∣stances
are not to be found, and even many in number, of
arbitrary pain applied to a theft of some importance: but
neither is this anywise repugnant to our position, which
only goes to the assertion of a discretionary power in the
Judge to punish the single act with death, in such cases where
he shall think that this high correction is due; so that the
very terms of the rule imply a variable course of prac∣tice,
in which the instances are numerous to the side of
mercy.</P>
<P>THE following are among the cases, which may be quoted
in proof of this discretionary power. The case of Thomas
Steele for stealing sixty-two sheep.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4. 1602.</NOTE> The case of Thomas
Frame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. 1608.</NOTE> for stealing three oxen and one cow, belonging to

Thomas Neilson, for stealing a horse<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It has been objected to this instance, which is taken notice of by Mackenzie, that Neilson was also charged as a common thief, and one who stood enacted for banishment. But it is no less certain, that no proof was attempted of that part of the charge, and that both the conviction and preamble of the sentence are ex∣pressly confined to the single act. The assize, 10th September, “fand, pro∣nouncit, and declarit the said pannell Thomas Neilson, to be guilty, culpable, and convict <HI>of the theftuous stealing of the horse</HI> belonging to John Henderson in Woodfoot of Tullibody, after the form and manner mentioned in the dittay.”—11th September, “Thomas Neilson being brought forth of prison to hear doom pronounced against him, as he who was found guilty upon the 10th Sep∣tember instant, <HI>of the crime of theft contained in his dittay;</HI> the Justice-depute therefore, by the mouth of Henry Monteath, dempster of Court, decerned and adjudged him to be taken upon the 18th day of September instant, betwixt two and four in the afternoon, to the Castlehill of Edinburgh, and there to be hanged on a gibbet till he be dead.”</NOTE>.

The case of Henry Forrester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26. 1662. and Feb 3 1663.</NOTE> hanged upon a verdict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1686.</NOTE> which,
as far as concerns him, convicts only of the theft of a gun<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This act is indeed charged alternatively either as theft or robbery. But at that time the term robbery was often used very loosely; and in this case it was improper: For the fact was a pretended quarrel among persons drinking in an alehouse, in the course of which they struck out the lights, and ran off with what they could lay their hands on, without knowledge of the owner, who swore up∣on on the trial, that he was only afraid of their hurting each other, and that he missed nothing for an hour after they were gone. The interlocutor finds the charge re∣levant for death under either quality: “Find the robbery <HI>or theft</HI> committed upon William Jackson's house, or art and part thereof relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to in∣fer the pains of death, and consiscation of moveables.” The verdict also makes use of both phrases, but chiefly theft: “And as to the second part of the lybel, the robbing of Jackson's house, they found the pannells have had a design to <HI>rob and steal,</HI> and for that end have had a combination with rogues to accom∣plish their design; wherefore the members of the assize, find the said Finlay Smith, guilty of <HI>robbing and stealing</HI> out of the said William Jackson's <HI>ane gunne,</HI> and that the said Henry Forrester was actually with him the time of the <HI>theft,</HI> and art and part with him.

THOUGH conviction did not follow on them, these interlo∣cutors

<P>AND in the case of Alexander Thomson, tried at Jed∣burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 11. 1714.</NOTE>
for stealing a pedlar's pack, this interlocutor was
<PB N="114" REF="173"/>
given by the Lords Minto and Poltoun. “The Lords find the
said Alexander Thomson, his away-taking and stealing
about the time libelled, the said William Douglas's pack,

<P>IT is farther to be observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of simple Theft.</NOTE> of some of those cases which
issued in an arbitrary pain, that they were attended with
such circumstanccs in the way of proceeding, as clearly in∣dicate
the opinion of the Court respecting the ordinary pain
for such offences. Thus in August 1661, David Murdoch, be∣ing
convicted of stealing seven cows, and it being represent∣ed
for him, that, he had made a free confession, that it was
his first offence, and had been committed in a state of ne∣cessity,
and that the man was penitent, the Court do not
however themselves venture to mitigate the pain, but refer
the decision of it, as an extraordinary matter, to the Lords
of Privy Council, from whom they receive a warrant,
grounded on these extenuations, to give sentence of banish∣ment
instead of death. The same course was taken in these
cases;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 6. 1639.</NOTE> that of Alexander Craig, convicted of stealing six
sheep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 21. &amp; 24. 1662.</NOTE> of John Rae, convicted of stealing four sheep; of
William Thomson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. and Feb. 23. 1664.</NOTE> convicted of stealing three cow-hides,
an old coat, and L. 27 Scots. The proceedings in the case
<PB N="115" REF="174"/>
of George Macdonald are of the same tendency. At cra∣ving
judgment upon this man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22. 1772.</NOTE> who had been convicted of
stealing seventeen sheep, Mr Solicitor reminded the Court,
that in charging the jury he had expressed his hope that an
arbitrary pain only would be inflicted, in case of conviction;
adding, that though he thought it fit to bring this under the
view of the Court, yet it lay with them to do as they saw
cause<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Compeared Mr Henry Dundas, “his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and re∣presented, That in summing up the evidence to the jury, he had taken the li∣berty of stating to them, that if the verdict returned by them should find the pannel only guilty of the stealth of the sheep libelled, he, in that case, was per∣suaded, that the Court would not inflict the utmost punishment of the law; and as it was still in the breast of their Lordships what judgment they would pro∣nounce in this cause, he had taken the liberty to bring this circumstance to the recollection of the Court,”</NOTE>. Now this sort of address, ordered to be entered on
the record, marks the opinion of the Court, that the judg∣ment
of transportation, which in this case they pronounced,
required to be accompanied with a statement of the reasons,
which had moved them to this course of mercy.</P>
<P>BUT what shall be esteemed a <HI>furtum grave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Theft; what it is.</NOTE> or great theft,
such as shall bring the pannel into hazard of his life? Cer∣tainly
the great value of the thing taken is always one ar∣ticle
of weight against him: In as much as this circum∣stance,
which allures and encourages the practised thief,
as naturally alarms and deters the new offender: In as
much too, as in taking so much more than he can need
for the supply of any present necessity, he forfeits any plea
which he might have on that ground, and shows a danger∣ous
rapacity of temper, of which less hope of amendment
<PB N="116" REF="175"/>
can be entertained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of William Creighton, on the south circuit, 1st May 1714, the Lord Minto found the stealing of one sheep only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain.</NOTE> Judgments have been quoted, which
proceed on this express distinction, and also other, no less
proper and necessary judgments, which find that the stealing
of a horse is such a theft, for which the offender shall have sentence of death.</P>
<P>BUT it would truly be a vain attempt to circumscribe this
matter within the letter of any absolute or invariable rule.
The Court, in giving judgment, consider the whole circum∣stances
of the case, among which the value of the thing
taken is but one, and liable to be affected by the other par∣ticulars
of the situation. It often happens, that the thief
himself is ignorant of the value of the thing when he takes it,
as in pocket-picking; and it may either be that he had, or that
he had not the opportunity of taking more at the time when
he. stole; on which ground he who steals a sheep or two out
of a flock, having it in his power to steal a greater number,
or the whole, has an argument in his favour, which he would
not have if he stole the same number of sheep, when pastu∣ring
by themselves. And hence it comes that judgments are
to be found, more than one, which affix only an arbitrary
pain to a theft of the same value, which in other less favour∣able
cases, or at times of more frequent, depredation of that
kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 24. and Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE> is punished with death. Thus in the case of James
Inglis<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Lords find, “That James Inglis, pannel, having at the times libelled, “stolen and thestuously taken away from off the street of Edinburgh, a mare be∣longing to Alexander Brown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there being a horse belonging to John Gibson, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> stolen about the time libelled, from Miln's Square in Edinburgh, and the said horse, within a few days thereafter, was found and seized in the pannel's possession, in the town of Tranent;, and there being another horse stolen at the time libelled, out of the Cowgate of Edinburgh, and thereafter, within a few days, also found and seized in the said pannel's possession, and that he the pannel, when examined thereupon, did acknowledge that he had stolen the said last horse, all <HI>jointly</HI> relevant to infer the pains of death, and confiscation of moveables; as also, find <HI>any</HI> of the saids horses being stolen in manner foresaid, and within a few days found in the pannel's possession, and he the said pannel, when examined, acknowledging that he had stolen <HI>any</HI> of the saids horses, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE>, the theft of three horses is found relevant to infer
<PB N="117" REF="176"/>
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEFT AND STOUTHRIEF.</NOTE> and the theft of one to infer only an arbitrary pain.
The like distinction is made in sundry trials on the circuits;
and on the 5th March 1734, John Scott, <HI>alias</HI> Park, convict∣ed
of stealing a horse, is only banished forth of Scotland,
though he had even stolen it by breaking into a stable. On
the whole, it is observable of these varieties of practice; that
this discretion of the Court in the punishing of theft, has
been to the great advantage of the pannel; since if a statute
were to be passed, appointing an invariable pain for the theft
of horses or cattle, certainly the public interest would not
allow this to be any other than the pain of death, in any
case, for the taking of even one.</P>
<P>XI. BESIDE this of the value of the thing taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Thief Ha∣bite and Repute.</NOTE> there
are other aggravations of the single act of theft, which also
warrant the inslicting of the capital pain; some of which
have relation to the person of the thief, and others, to the
mode of the particular theft. Among the former, I shall
first attend to that most useful, as well as reasonable rule,
which relates to the character of the pannel, and holds the
single act of theft for capital, though not otherwise a <HI>furtum
grave,</HI> if it be the act of a common thief, (<HI>fur famosus,</HI>) one
who is held and reported, or <HI>habite and repute,</HI> (according to
<PB N="118" REF="177"/>
our phrase for it), to be one of that calling, and to make or help
his livelihood in the way of thieving. In such a case, the
general character and way of life of the pannel being duly
established, the particular act comes to be regarded only as
a confirmation and detected instance of his daily course of
evil doing, and his punishment to be proportioned to the
habits and calling of the man, as a trained thief, and com∣mon
nuisance to the country. In older and more disorderly
times, so much higher was the regard paid to this article of
common <HI>bruit</HI> and fame, that one who stood convicted of it
by an inquest, and could find none to answer for him, was on
that one ground to be held as a proven thief or robber, and to
be disposed of accordingly. “<HI>Fiat de eo,”</HI> says the statute of
Alexander II. c. 13. <HI>“sicut de latrone probato.”</HI> To the same
purpose, the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> b. 4. c. 14.; and c. 17. of the
statutes of David II<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There are many memorandums in the older records, which would lead one by their terms to suspect that this had continued to be the law at a later time. Thus, 28th April 1554, “Thomas. Armstrong <HI>convictus de communi furto, communi “furti receptatione, extraportatione et importatione, furtivo modo, et suspen.”</HI> But nothing can be affirmed with certainty upon such short and imperfect entries.</NOTE> And this course of proceeding it
probably was, that served as the foundation of that mitiga∣ted
sort of charge, and more suitable to the altered condi∣tion
of the country, which was received in after times, and
still retains an undoubted place in the practice of our Courts.</P>
<P>THIS rule is so well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Thief Ha∣bite and Repute.</NOTE> that it would be no less use∣less
than tedious to confirm it, by referring to any consider∣able
number of the judgments, which have been given to
that effect. But I shall take notice of a few, which are
chosen in the different periods of our practice. There is
this memorandum in the record, of December 1539, “Cocky
<PB N="119" REF="178"/>
Turner <HI>filius Johannis in Dollar, convict de arte et parte,
furti unius ovis lie wedder, a Johanne Lowres extra Dollar,

horse,” has the like fate. On the 11th February 1584.

5. 1782, for stealing<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This man had also severely wounded the owner of the sheep; but this was charged as a separate offence.</NOTE> two sheep.</P>
<P>IT is not sufficient to conviction of this charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of Habite and Repute.</NOTE> that the
pannel is a person of doubtful fame, or one concerning
whom suspicions are entertained, and evil rumours have
been abroad. He must have laboured under the common
<HI>bruit</HI> and defamation of the neighbourhood as a thief, and
have had a character affixed to him as a brother and asso∣ciate
of the trade. In the case therefore of George Macdo∣nald
<HI>alias</HI> Badenoch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 18. &amp; 22. 1772.</NOTE> where the jury made this distinction,
having found, “that it is not proven that the pannel is ha∣bite
and repute a thief, although of a suspicious character,”
sentence of transportation only ensued.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, with respect to the proof of this repute:
though judicial proceedings, such as warrants to search the
pannel's house, or repeated commitments for, or convictions
of theft, are the most unexceptionable, they are not however,
the only or an indispensible evidence of this sort of charge.
According to the settled practice, it may equally be esta∣blished
by the testimony, if positive and uniform, of cre∣dible
and proper witnesses, who have cause of knowledge,
and depone in general terms to the estimation of the pan∣nel,
with the neighbourhood and with themselves. We have
instances of capital conviction in both ways. Upon the
trial of John Johnston for pocket-picking<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the 14th March 1786, Walter Ross had sentence of death, being con∣victed as habite and repute, and of two acts of pocket-picking; the one of a pocket∣book with L. 26, the other of an almanack with L. 13.</NOTE>, three convic∣tions
in inferior courts were given in evidence. In that of<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. 1786.</NOTE>
<PB N="121" REF="180"/>
Thomas Gordon, in February 1782, the proof was of the
other description, with the exception of one commitment
for an assault<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A proof of the same sort was brought in the case of James and Ronald Mac∣grigor, in August 1736, upon which the jury found, “that they are reputed to be thieves in the country.”</NOTE>. In the case of Wilson and Macdonald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 11. 1751.</NOTE>
there was no testimony to any charge or commitment; but
an associate swore to their way of life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. &amp; 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1731.</NOTE> In that of Thomas
Henderson, one witness swore to a charge of horse-stealing,
and two to the pannel's general repute.</P>
<P>BY the ordinary stile of indictment, this of <HI>habite and re∣pute</HI>
is only laid as an aggravation of the special charges
of theft. Should the pannel therefore be acquitted of these,
and the repute nevertheless be found to be proved, no pu∣nishment
can follow on the verdict, but at most only an
award, in the way of prevention, ordaining the pannel to find
caution for his good behaviour. Such an order was accord∣ingly
given on conviction to that effect, in the case of
James and Ronald Macgrigor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. 1736.</NOTE> It follows on the other part,
that a general verdict of <HI>not guilty</HI> returned on such a charge,
will not hinder the pannel to be tried, even the next day,
for a different act of theft, charged with the same aggra∣vation,
drawn from his fame and course of life. For not
only is the habite and repute no proper point of dittay,
or punishable accusation, to which the maxim of▪ <HI>not tholing
an assize twice</HI> can apply, but farther, such a verdict cannot
even be construed into an acquittal of that quality of the
charge; on which the jury were not bound to pronounce,
unless some special fact of theft had at the same time been
proved, so as to make room for that sort of aggravation.
This plea was stated and repelled in the case of John Reid,
indicted in August 1774, for stealing sheep, and as habite
<PB N="122" REF="181"/>
and repute a sheep-stealer, and who had been acquitted on
the like charge in 1766. It seems too to have been re∣pelled
generally, and without any limitation of the proof
to the period between these years.</P>
<P>XII. FROM this kind of aggravation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of repeated Theft.</NOTE> which amounts to
a presumption in law, founded on the character of the pan∣nel,
that he has often been guilty in the same sort before,
we naturally pass to that other, also capital aggravation,
which arises from his repeated trial and conviction as a
thief. Which situation, as it deprives him of all those ex∣cuses,
which may often be justly pleaded for the first tres∣pass,
and yields evidence of a perverse and corrupted habit
of mind, so it justly places his life in the power of the
Court.</P>
<P>UPON this head, lawyers have proposed two points to con∣sideration;
as to which they have been of different opi∣nions
according to their several casts of temper, and views
of human character, or of policy and discipline. The one
relates to the number of acts, and whether fewer than three,
which shall warrant the inflicting of death, and the other to the
course taken with these acts, whether they must be the subject
of repeated convictions and punishments, undergone and dis∣regarded
by the pannel, or if it be sufficient that they are all
proved at the same time, upon one charge and trial of the
whole. Now, as to the practice of Scotland: it must be
evident from what has been already said of it, that except
with regard to mere pilferies and thefts of the very lowest
and most venial nature, the state of the law is exclusive of
any absolute limitation on either of these heads. For if
it be true, as has been said, that the Court have a discretion∣ary
<PB N="123" REF="182"/>
power with respect even to a single act of theft, to pu∣nish
it according to the wickedness of the act, as it can be
collected from the whole circumstances of the case; much
more must they have the like discretion in the trial of repeat∣ed
theft, if the things taken be of any value, such as raises
the offence to be more than a pilfery; though the acts are
neither to the number of three, nor have any of them been
the subject of a former conviction. That is to say, if upon
the libel which is in Court, being the first charge against
the pannel, he is convicted of two acts of theft, neither of
them inconsiderable, and such as taken together and in their
whole circumstances mark him for a practised thief; as if
he have stolen two or three sheep at one time, and ten or
twelve pounds at another, by picking the lock of the place
in which it lay; then may sentence of death pass against
him: though if he were tried for either of these acts sepa∣rately,
the same severity would not be applied to his case.
Or, if upon the libel which is in Court, the pannel is con∣victed
of one not inconsiderable theft, and is also proved to
have had sentence of pillory or scourging for another theft
of somewhat less magnitude, but such as merited those pains,
this progress in boldness, and in contempt of the chastise∣ment
of the law, is in like manner a reason for dealing
with him, as one who is in the trade, and is not likely to
quit it.</P>
<P>IT is certain that the course of practice has been regu∣lated
by these views.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of repeated Theft.</NOTE> Thus, on the 13th December 1557,
John Fidler in Howburn, has sentence of death, being con∣victed
of stealing eleven wedders, and of resetting his ser∣vant
William Lithgow in his thievish misdeeds, particularly
when he stole four wedders and an ox.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 7. 1614.</NOTE> William Middlebuy
<PB N="124" REF="183"/>
has the like sentence, for stealing certain articles of wearing
apparel, “and out-putting” (as the libel terms it), “ane brown
ambling horse, the property of the goodman of Carberry,
his master for the time,” to another person, a notorious
thief, who paid him part of the price received for it. As
have John Brown and Andrew Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 29 1616.</NOTE> convicted on one libel
of two acts of stealing a horse. In like manner, William
Young and John Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 11. 1698.</NOTE> have sentence of death on a ver∣dict,
which amounts to a conviction of sundry, (it is not said
how many), acts of pocket-picking, done in society with
each other<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The assize found it proven, “That John Hamilton, <HI>alias</HI> Scarlet, is guilty of combination and society of picking and cutting of purses or pockets, and other∣ways of stealing and thieving at fairs and markets, in so far as he took several persons oaths to do the same; and likewise find proven, That he is guilty of receiving the same money stolen, to bear their expence as they went through the country; and also finds proven, That whatever should be stolen should be delivered to him: And as to William Young, finds proven, That he is guilty of association by swearing to Scarlet, and stealing and picking of pockets, and delivering what was stolen to Scarlet: And as to John Garden, finds nothing of the libel proven.” 12th December 1698.</NOTE>. Again, on the north circuit, May 1721, in the
trial of Alexander Maccoull<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">May 2. 1721. “Finds, That the said pannels, or either of them, being guilty or art and part of <HI>any one of the thefts libelled,</HI> relevant to infer an arbi∣trary punishment; but finds the said Alexander Maccoull, or either of them, being guilty or art and part <HI>of two or more of the thefts libelled,</HI> relevant to in∣fer the pain of death and confiscation of moveables.”</NOTE> and others, indicted for sun∣dry
thefts of sheep and cattle, the Court found his guilt
of any <HI>one</HI> of the charges, relevant to infer an arbitrary pain,
and his guilt of any <HI>two</HI> of them, relevant to infer the pain

and of his former conviction of the same crime<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">John Brown, 8th February 1774, was hanged for stealing two horses, the property of different persons, at two different times. William Philp was hanged, 13th March 1769, for stealing a horse at one time, and two at another: And James Trotter, tried at Jedburgh, 26th April 1783, for the theft of two horses, stolen at different times. In each of these cases, the pannel was convicted of all the act on one libel.</NOTE> in Au∣gust
1720, is condemned to die. Lastly, at Inverness,
Hugh Ross had sentence of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 18. 19. &amp; 21. 1785.</NOTE> on conviction of stealing
eight sheep or lambs at one time, and five lambs at another,
from the same farm.</P>
<P>THE question therefore with us, will only relate to those
acts, which properly fall under the appellation of pilfering
or little thieving, such as the breaking of gardens, or the
stealing of poultry, or of handkerchiefs from the pocket.
With respect to these, I have not. found any thing in our re∣cords,
to countenance the opinion that fewer than three
offences shall be sustained to infer the pain of death, (if even
that number be sufficient), or that the warning of successive
trials and convictions shall be dispensed with. To require
that number, seems to be in some measure the common prac∣tice
of nations in cases of this description, and the rule has
the support with us of this circumstance, that with regard
to certain other petty offences, of a nature somewhat allied
to theft, and which are ordered by statute to be dealt with
accordingly, such as the destroying of green wood, and the
breaking of dovecotes and cunningaires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535, c. 11.; 1579, c. 84.</NOTE> it is only the third
offence, that is punished with death.</P>
<P>XIII. These seem to be the only aggravations relative to
the person of the thief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft in a landed Man.</NOTE> of which notice can be taken, as
grounds in law, of pronouncing judgment of death on him
<PB N="126" REF="185"/>
for his crime. The guilt is indeed greater in a near rela∣tion
of the owner, or in his domestic servant, or other per∣son
in a situation of trust under him; as it also is if the
thief be in that rank and situation of life, which ought to
set him above the temptation of this mean and degrading
vice. But although, in a certain degree, regard will be paid
to any of these circumstances, as well as to several others
which are easy to be imagined; yet it is not in such a man∣ner,
as entitles them to a place in this list of the known ca∣pital
aggravations. In this the condition of the law is dif∣ferent
now, from what it was in older and more unruly
times, when thieving was not the peculiar habit of the low
and indigent, but often common to them with persons of
rank and landed estate, who not only robbed and plun∣dered
themselves, but entertained bands of lawless and bro∣ken
followers, who, emboldened by their countenance and
protection, set the ordinary powers of law, in some measure,
at defiance. To repress so pernicious a disorder, the statute
1587, c. 50. raised the crimes of common theft, reset of
theft, and stouthrief in landed men, to the rank and pains
of treason; and on this law, many convictions were soon
afterwards obtained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1601. Mar. 30. and April 1. 1601. Aug. 23. 1603. Jan. 12. 1604. Aug. 12. 1608. Sept. 6. 1610. July 2. 1617.</NOTE> As in the case of James Davidson;
James and William Wood; George Turnbull; George Mel∣drum;
John Hamilton of Spittleshiells; William Douglas of
Lincludden, a notorious thief and robber; and Adam Ross.
In the second of these cases, the appellation of landed man
was applied, (which may seem a doubtful judgment), to an
apparent heir, in the lifetime of his father<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This forfeiture was afterwards challenged, as appears from an unprinted act of the 17th Parl. of James VI; which gives commission to the Court of Session to judge in the reduction of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="186"/>
ACCORDING to Mackenzie, the term of <HI>common theft,</HI>
used in the statute, was not to be understood of habitual and
repeated, but of simple and ordinary theft; but this is nei∣ther
agreeable to the ordinary acceptation of the phrase in
law language, nor to what Mackenzie himself has elsewhere
said upon the same subject<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, tit. Theft, No. 12, and tit. Robbery, No. 2.</NOTE>. The decision of this, or of any
of the other controversies which had been moved respecting
the construction of that statute, is, however, of no moment
since the act of the 7th of Queen Anne, ch. 21. which abo∣lished
all the sictitious treasons of the Scots law, and redu∣ced
this sort of theft to its proper rank.</P>
<P>XIV. AMONG those aggravations which relate to the
particular act that is under trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft done by violence.</NOTE> the principal is, if it be
done by means of violence. This may either be directed
against the person of the possessor, and then it is properly the
crime of robbery or stouthrief, of which afterwards, or
against the place of custody or deposit of the thing, where∣to
for security it has been committed.</P>
<P>IN general, it seems to be true of all theft, which is ac∣complished
by the forcing or effraction of any shut or fasten∣ed
place of keeping, that it is held to be of an aggravated
nature, by reason of the bold and deliberate temper, which
appears in the manner of the enterprise. Thus, he who
steals by breaking open a booth, or other the like temporary
place of sale, or by breaking open a chest, cupboard, or
other lockfast place within a house, though his crime is not
thereby so much altered as to receive any peculiar appella∣tion,
will, however, be more severely punished, (and, it may
be, capitally), than if he had taken the same article from a
more exposed and tempting situation.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="187"/>
BUT the species of violent theft, to which the law has
paid the most particular attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft by House-breaking.</NOTE> is that which is done by
the violent entry of a house; for this it now distinguishes
by the name of house-breaking, and holds to be in every in∣stance
a capital crime, without regard to the quantity or
value of the spoil made, be it ever so inconsiderable. The
plain grounds of this severity are, that the thing is done
with that contrivance and deliberation, to which none but
the practised offender is equal; and that in thus venturing
his person to take the thing from within the very sanctuary
assigned for keeping it, and notwithstanding all the ob∣stacles
contrived for its safe detention, he shows a resolute
and daring spirit, from which even the inhabitants of the
house, or any who shall try to seize or stay him in his pur∣pose,
must, by reasonable inference, be held to be in danger
of their lives and persons.</P>
<P>IT will not always bring a case within the description of
house-breaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Entry in House-break∣ing.</NOTE> that the thing is taken out of the house,
and by means of an entry made with intent to steal; for
if the entry is at an open door or window, the thief is in
some measure tempted by the opportunity; as well as it is
in some sort a wrong in the owner to leave his property in
this neglected state. On the other part, law understands it
to be house-breaking, wheresoever the thief opens a way in∣to
the house for himself, and overcomes the ordinary ob∣stacles
provided against entry thereof, and for the safe keep∣ing
of what it contains; though this should be done with∣out
out the piercing or actual effraction of any part of the build∣ing
itself, or of what is attached thereto: since it is neverthe∣less
true, that the strength and security of the house is inva∣ded
and broken. Thus it is equally a house breaking to en∣ter
<PB N="129" REF="188"/>
the house by means of false keys, or pick-locks, or by
any how putting aside the bolt, as by bursting open the
lock. It was judged accordingly in the case of Alexan∣der
Snaill<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel in this case charged various acts, but was restricted to a single in∣stance of entry by false keys, as contained in his own confession; which bore, that after entry, he stole some butter from a chest, and was taken within the house, with false keys and a chizel upon him.</NOTE>, who had sentence of death for a single act of
entry by false keys,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 1698.</NOTE> and stealing an article of small value;
as also in that of John Pringle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6. 1715.</NOTE> where a capital relevancy
was found upon charge to that effect<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">June 20. 1715. “And find the pannell, his breaking the house of Mrs Ferguson, and robbing, stealing, or away carrying the linen cloaths lybelled, about the time lybelled, or <HI>separatim</HI> the said house being broke, and the said stolen goods, or part thereof, being depositat in the hangsman's house by the said pannell, <HI>and his having of crooked irons or instruments proper for opening and picking of locks</HI> found about him when apprehended, relevant to infer the pain of death, and other pains lybelled; and sicklike, the said Lords find the said pannell, his breaking into the shop of Agnes Clark, under cloud and silence of night, and stealing of several things furth thereof, about the time lybelled, or <HI>separatim</HI> the said shop being broke, and the pannell having the goods stolen furth thereof, or disposing of the same, or part thereof, about the time lybelled, <HI>and his having the said crooked irons or instruments proper for opening and pick∣ing of locks</HI> found about him when apprehended, also relevant to infer the pain of death.</NOTE>; and again in the
case of Smith and Brodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27. 1788.</NOTE> who suffered death on conviction
of a single act of theft, committed in the same way. Nor
will it receive any other determination, if the entry is made
by means of the true key, which the thief has previously
stolen, or if, having occasion to be in the house, he un∣fasten
a window or shutter, and so return in the night-time,
and enter<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The libel against William Brown, collier, 16th June 1715, relates, That having occasion to be in a certain work-shop by day, he secretly thrust aside the latch of a window, and, returning in the night, opened the sash, and entered. But I cannot find that this libel ever came to any judgment on the relevancy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="189"/>
LIKEWISE, he is guilty of no lower crime who enters by
coming down the chimney;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Entry in House-break∣ing.</NOTE> which was the fact in the case
of Rendal Courtney, who accordingly had sentence of
death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This man entered the house of Cadham, by means of a rope let down the kitchen-vent. The jury “find, That the house was <HI>broke open and robbed;</HI> and likewise find it proven, That the pannel, Rendal Courtney, was guilty actor, art and part, of the said <HI>house-breaking and robbery.</HI>” The libel did not state how the entry was, but, simply, that “he broke into the said house.”</NOTE>; or who enters through a sewer which issues from a
cellar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. &amp; 6. 1743.</NOTE> or other part of the house, and passes under ground:
for neither of these is a place of entry, nor necessary to
be any farther guarded than it is by its own nature, against
attempts of this sort.</P>
<P>NAY, the same construction has more than once been ap∣plied
to the case of entry at a window, by simply raising the
casement, without removal of any bolt or other fastening:
and certainly with as good reason; since the window is no
place of entry more than the chimney, and the house is clo∣sed
and secured against access, when the fash is let down.
John Watson had sentence of death upon charge and proof of
two acts of theft committed in that way<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“In as much as you the said John Watson, did by a window in a closet of the manse of Maytown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enter the said manse, and did theftuously and fe∣loniously steal.” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It appears from the proof that both in this, and the other instance libelled, he entered by raising the sash, without any force or effraction.</NOTE>. As had William
Mills and Archibald Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 6. 1773.</NOTE> each of them for two acts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1785. Mar. 14. 1785.</NOTE> one
of which, in either case, was charged without any mention
<PB N="131" REF="190"/>
of force employed to make open the window<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“You the said Archibald Stewart did feloniously <HI>break</HI> or enter into a house called Neidpath Castle, belonging to his Grace the Duke of Queensber∣ty, in the parish of Peebles, and county of Peebles, <HI>by entering in at a win∣dow</HI> of the said Castle, and did steal,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>“And this you (William Mills) did, by means of a ladder, by which you ascended to, and got in at one of the windows of the said compting-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.”</P>
<P>The libel against Margaret Johnston and Helen Riddell, 7th February 1775, runs thus: “Whereas, by the laws of this, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> house-breaking, <HI>or the opening of doors and windows of houses possessed by others,</HI> and feloniously stealing there∣from.” These women were banished on their own petition.</P>
<P>John Allan was banished in the same form, on the 27th January 1774. He was charged with two acts of <HI>house-breaking;</HI> one by opening with some in∣strument, a door which was fastened with a timber bar on the inside, the other by lifting the window-sash of a laundry, and entering.</P></NOTE>. This con∣struction
is farther warranted by the more ancient case of
George Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16. 1672.</NOTE> who was indicted <HI>(inter alia) for robbing
the house</HI> of David Cunningham, having made his entry by
creeping in at the window, after which he opened the door
to his associate, Smith, without. The verdict found them
guilty of the <HI>thefts and robberies</HI> libelled; and they had sen∣tence
of death.</P>
<P>IT may even be maintained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Entry in House-break∣ing.</NOTE> that it is substantially a house-breaking
in certain cases, though the immediate act which
gives admission is not the act of the thief, but of the pos∣sessor
of the house. If the thief knock at a door by night,
under pretence of asking the way, and upon opening rush
in and steal, or if thieves beset a house to break into it, and
the owner open the door to drive them off, and they over∣power
him and enter; in either case they seem to be answer∣able
for it, as for an effraction of the building: because the
owner is here no better than an instrument in their hands,
and serves, in a manner, as a key to the house, which they
<PB N="132" REF="191"/>
have fraudulently and feloniously got possession of. The
crime in such a case is an invasion of the house, coupled to
a robbery or stouthrief; since the person of the master, as
well the strength of the building, opposes their entry, and
is overcome. We have had two instances of capital con∣viction
upon a charge of this kind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 10. &amp; 17. 1665.</NOTE> Patrick Macgrigor had
sentence of death for the theft of goods and money from
the house of Inchbellie, whereof he and his accomplices
obtained entry by calling up the master of the house under
night, to shew them the way, and threatening to burn the
house on his refusal; whereupon his wife, being terrified,
opened and gave access to them; and they carried off a
quantity of linen and other goods. The other is the case
of John Brown and James Wilson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1773.</NOTE> who having called the
master of the house to the door under night, under the
like pretence, instantly set upon, beat him down, and kil∣led
him; and having thus got entry, broke open his chest,
and carried off a sum of money. In the first of these cases,
the libel was however laid as for theft and hamesucken;
of which last charge the pannel was acquitted: In the
other, it was laid as for murder, robbery, and <HI>house-pillaging.</HI>
To these illustrations may be added the case of a servant,
who combines with thieves, and opens a window to them,
by which they enter and steal. This seems to be house-breaking
in all concerned: for the servant is art and part
of a felonious entry made by his associates; and they make
use of him, as they would of a pick-lock or other unlawful
instrument, to accomplish their purpose.</P>
<P>IT is more doubtful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking out of the House after Stealing.</NOTE> and in England a statute was
therefore passed upon the case, whether one who con∣ceals
<PB N="133" REF="192"/>
himself in a house with intent to steal, and after steal∣ing
breaks out of the house, to make his escape, is guilty of
the same crime. The contrivance, deliberation, and even
boldness of such an attempt, may seem to be little less than
that of him who makes his way through the inclosure of
the house before stealing. Yet I find, that in two cases
of this description,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27. 1774.</NOTE> that of James Mackenzie, and that of
William Wright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 10. 1774.</NOTE> the charge is laid as for simple theft, and
the pannels are transported on their own petition.</P>
<P>IT may likewise admit a question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodger breaking into another Chamber.</NOTE> whether it comes up to
the notion of house-breaking, (though it is an aggravated
theft, and may sometimes be punished with death), that one
who is lawfully within a house, such as the occupier of a hired
chamber, forces the door of another chamber of the house in
the night time, and steals. It is true, there is here a breaking
of what is part of the house, to accomplish the stealing; but
still the thief is under the roof, and within the inclosure
of the tenement, and has thus both better opportunity, and
greater temptation to steal, than one who has to force his
way from without. Such a case was that of Wilson, Hall,
and Robertson, (tried in March 1736), who all had sentence
of death, for forcibly breaking into a locked chamber in an
inn, from another room where they had been drinking
under night, and carrying off the money and effects of a
lodger, who made his escape by the window, to avoid
their violence. But the charge was made under the seve∣ral
names of <HI>house-breaking, stouthrief or robbery,</HI> to either of
which last the fact certainly amounted; since the things were
taken from under the special protection of the owner, and
by means of an assault upon his person: Neither can it be
said, upon the words of the interlocutor, to which of those de∣nominations
<PB N="134" REF="193"/>
the act was referred by the Court<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords sind, “That the said pannels, or any of them, having, time and place libelled, <HI>by violence broken into the room</HI> where James Stark, collec∣tor, was lodged, or that they or any of them did carry off bank-notes, gold, sil∣ver, or other goods out of the said room, or that they or any of them were art and part of any of the said crimes, relevant to infer the pains of law.” 9th March 1736.</NOTE>. But in
whichever way this point shall be settled, it will not be pre∣tended
that there can be any protection to the person, who,
being lodged in a barn or other out-house, shall leave it in the
night, and enter the mansion-house, or any other of the out-houses,
by breaking in at the door or window: If he does
so, his act is quite the same, as that of one who has come
from a greater distance.</P>
<P>IN regard to the circumstance of entering the house:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a sufficient Entry of the House.</NOTE>
This is no otherwise material to the notion of house-break∣ing,
than as it enables the thief to seize and remove some
thing which is under the protection and keeping of the build∣ing.
It is not therefore necessary that the thief have been
within the house with his whole person: He is guilty, if he
has been in it in such a manner, and being so by violence, that
he carries something off from within it. As if he forces open
the casement of a window, and putting in his hand only,
snatches up, and runs off with any article that lies within
his reach. This was the opinion of the Court, upon the de∣bate
in the case of William Gadesby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1790.</NOTE> who had sentence of
death upon conviction to that effect. The English authori∣ties,
speaking of the crime of burglary<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 227.</NOTE>, have said, that
there is even a sufficient entry by the pushing of a hook,
pole, or other instrument, into the house, to draw out goods,
<PB N="135" REF="194"/>
though the offender have never been within it, with any
part of his body. And, if this be true of that crime, which
consists in the breaking of a house, with intent to commit
a felony, though that object should not be accomplished,
much stronger reason is there for the same construction ap∣plied
to our crime of house breaking, which is only then
committed, when by means of the violent entry something
has actually been taken away; so that the breaking and en∣try
have fully answered the invader's purpose.</P>
<P>IT is likewise certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be art and part, without Entry.</NOTE> and falls under the common rules
of <HI>art and part,</HI> that a person may be convicted of house-breaking,
though with respect to him personally, there has
never been an entry of the house at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 6. 1780.</NOTE> Thus, Donaldson
broke into and entered a shop; and Calder watched without,
procured a light, and received the goods which Donaldson
threw out to him; and for this accession, Calder had sen∣tence
of death along with Donaldson. On the 7th of the
same month, Charles Cocks had sentence of death, for an ac∣cession
of the same kind. Also, in the case, already mentioned,
of Wilson, Hall, and Robertson, (which was at least a case of
stouthrief or violent theft), the office of Robertson, as char∣ged
in the libel, was to watch at the door of the inn, while
his associates, above stairs, were employed in breaking up
the door of the chamber.</P>
<P>IT has already been intimated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft by House-breaking always capital.</NOTE> that the notion of house-breaking
in the law of Scotland, is theft committed by vio∣lent
entry of the house; so that without the removal of some
article, in the same sense as already explained, under the
head of simple theft, there is no ground for this sort of charge.
But if any thing is taken, it signifies not of how little value
<PB N="136" REF="195"/>
it be. The resolute and dangerous disposition of the thief, is
manifest in the way of his attack; and it cannot be doubted
of him who comes in this fashion, that more he would have
taken, if more had fallen under his hands, and all circum∣stances
had suited to carry it away. Many cases might be
cited in proof of this, but I shall confine myself to one,
which may serve instead of all others; the case, already men∣tioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1698.</NOTE>
of Alexander Snaill, who had sentence of death for
entering a house by means of false keys, and stealing a
small quantity of butter from a chest. The charge too was
only proved by his own confession<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The case is printed entire in the Appendix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Houses are protected by this Law.</NOTE> with respect to the places which have the be∣nefit
of this protection. It is not disputed, that every man∣sion-house,
or tenement destined for habitation, enjoys it, how
mean and fragile soever it be; as indeed the houses of the poor
the more especially require to be guarded in this way, that
they are generally weak in themselves, and are often left void
during the day, and unprovided with any defence, other than
that which the terror of the law shall lend them. Like-wise,
every dwelling-place is guarded by this sanction, whether
it be or be not inhabited at the time, nay, though it have
never yet been dwelt in, nor thoroughly prepared for habi∣tation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1785.</NOTE>
One of the charges, on which William Mills had
sentence of death, was the breaking into the house of Dal∣ry,
which, as the libel says, “had some time before been
occupied by William Walker.” And in the case of Stuart
and Gordon, in March 1785, one article which was found re∣levant,
and went to trial with the others, was a charge of
house-breaking, committed “on a house which had then
been lately built in Merchant Street in Edinburgh, for Tho∣mas
<PB N="137" REF="196"/>
Cleghorn, merchant in Edinburgh, and was at that time
unoccupied by any person.” Which is more express than
any of these; on the 10th April 1783, Thomas Thomson
had sentence of death for repeated acts of breaking into
new, unoccupied, and unfinished houses, and stealing the
carpenters' tools.</P>
<P>BY the law of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Houses are protected by this Law.</NOTE> the crime of burglary relates to
dwelling-places, and can only be committed upon any shop,
warehouse, or out-house, if it be adjoining to a mansion-house,
so as to have right to the same protection, under the
notion of being parcel of the mansion. And this may be
a reasonable limitation according to the proper notion of
burglary, already taken notice of, but would be quite un∣suitable,
and is not admitted in our law, which only recog∣nises
the capital offence, when there is a stealing as well as
breaking. Every edifice, therefore, to what use soever de∣stined,
whether it be a counting-room, public office, place
of work, sale, store, or what else, is the subject: of a capital
pain in the breaking; so it be what can properly be consi∣dered,
and in common speech would be called, a house, or
shut and fast building, and is not a mere open shed, booth,
or temporary place of lumber. Charles Cunningham was
capitally convicted on the 12th March 1783, for breaking
into a wash-house at one time, and a brushmaker's work-house
at another: Alexander Mowat, on 8th April 1783,
for picking the lock of a printing-house, and through this
breaking into a counting-room, and stealing: Smith and
Brodie, on the 27th August 1788, for breaking into the Excise-office,
and stealing sixteen pounds: Bruce and Falconer on
the 14th August 1788, and James Dick on the 28th Novem∣ber
1788, for breaking into the office of the Dundee Bank:
<PB N="138" REF="197"/>
and William Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, (beside other acts) for breaking into a
private counting-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18, 1785.</NOTE> situated in a timber-yard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Charge of theft, aggravated by house-breaking, was also sustained against Da∣vid Mitchell, 14th July 1791, for breaking into a feed-loft and a stable; and against Christopher Beattie and Margaret Thomson, 11th July 1791, for break∣ing into a waste-house. In both of these cases, the Advocate saw cause to restrict the libel to an arbitrary pain, and the pannels being convicted, were adjudged to transportation for life.</P>
<P>Alexander Leitch and James Wilmer, indicted for house breaking, by entry of a coach-house, and a wash-house, had sentence of transportation on their own petition. 17th December 1785.</P></NOTE>. In all
these instances, either the crime was charged under the
name of <HI>house-breaking,</HI> or, which is a more advantageous
form of charge, the theft was laid as aggravated in being
committed by means of house-breaking. This, in particular,
was the form of the libel in the case of Alexander Mowat,
where the objection was stated, but was over-ruled, that
the printing-house and counting-room were distinct from
any dwelling-house, and were not themselves to be account∣ed
a house; whereby the aggravation charged would not
apply. In some instances, the term of <HI>shop-breaking,</HI> or other
equivalent and fuller expression has been employed; as in
the trial of Macdonald and Jamieson<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. 1770. April 6. 1780. April. 7. 1780. July 8. 1782.</NOTE> Calder and Donald∣son<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The forcibly and feloniously breaking open, or into the shops, or other places, used by the lieges for carrying on their lawful business, and stealing or feloniously taking away from such shops or places, merchant ware or goods.”</NOTE>, Charles Cocks, and John Macdonald; and in others
the fact has been charged as theft, aggravated in being done
by breaking into a shop, warehouse, or other place of de∣posit,
named and characterised according as the case required.
But under all these different forms, the dittay is substan∣tially
the same, and equally falls under the capital sanction,
<PB N="139" REF="198"/>
which the law has annexed to the act of stealing by violent
entry of a house.</P>
<P>XV. THE other prime instance of forcible theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Robbery or Stouthrief.</NOTE> is that
which is committed by invasion of the person, and is now
termed robbery, and formerly passed under the more general
name of <HI>stouthrief;</HI> which was applicable, generally, to every
sort of masterful theft or depredation.</P>
<P>1. IT is proper in this place to repeat what has already
been said of theft in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Robbery, if nothing is taken.</NOTE> but might perhaps he supposed
not to apply here, on account of the aggravation of vio∣lence,
—that the charge will not lie unless something be
carried away. Though an assault be made with intent to
take, and be on the very point of succeeding, as by the person
having his purse in his hand to deliver, or letting it fall from
his hand through trepidation, or being beaten to the ground
insensible, so that accident only hinders the full accomplish∣ment
of the invader's purpose, it still is not a robbery, but
only an attempt to rob; which may however be punished
at common law, with the highest arbitrary pain. Beside
the reasons for this in the nature itself of the act; under any
other construction, the notion of the complete crime would be
altogether arbitrary and uncertain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>It was argued for the prosecutor, in the case of Cranstoun, in September 1723, that it was sufficient if the robber were once master of the <HI>person,</HI> for that he was thus master of his money too. But the libel charged, and the verdict found the abstraction of a certain article. And no interlocutor to that effect was given.</P>
<P>In the case of Edward Farrell, tried for robbery at the Old Bailey, in July 1787, it was found that the prisoner stopped the prosecutor, as he was carrying a feather-bed on his shoulders, and threatened to shoot him if he did not lay it down. The man laid it down, but the prisoner was seized before he could take it up. The Judges were of opinion, that the crime was not complete. Leache's Cases, p. 266.</P></NOTE>. In the case therefore of
<PB N="140" REF="199"/>
Gavin Lowrie, 18th March 1783, of David and William
Dalgleish, 4th April 1780, and John Irvine, 25th September
1744, the assaulting and beating, or firing at a person with
intent to rob, or on account of the refusal to deliver, is
charged as a distinct and separate crime from robbery<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“As also the assaulting the lieges, and firing at them, in order to force them to give up or deliver their property, though not attended with the said effect, or the so firing, because such money or effects were not delivered up,” <HI>&amp;c. Major</HI> of the libel in the <HI>case of Dalgleish.</HI></P>
<P>“As also the assaulting persons upon a public highway, with an intention to rob them, and knocking them to the ground with a bludgeon or other wea∣pon, are crimes.” <HI>Case of Lowrie.</HI></P></NOTE>.
For the same reason, the charge in the libel against Robert
Steedman was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11. 1782.</NOTE> with respect to one article, made alternative,
as for robbery, or an attempt to rob; the fact in that in∣stance
being, that the person assaulted having taken out his
watch to deliver it, either he let it fall, owing to confusion,
or it was by a chance-blow struck to the ground, where it
was found lying, without ever, as far as appeared, having
been in the pannel's hand. Acts of complete robbery
were also charged in the libel; and the interlocutor was ge∣neral,
for the pains of law.</P>
<P>2. IN the construction of what shall be deemed a <HI>taking,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What is con∣strued a taking by Robbery.</NOTE>
we rather attend to the substance of the case, which is that
the thing has come into the hands of the invader by
means of his violence, than to the mode itself of the imme∣diate
act of apprehension. The purse shall therefore be
held to be <HI>taken,</HI> though the owner, being terrified, have
<PB N="141" REF="200"/>
with his own hand delivered it on demand; or though it
have fallen to the ground in a struggle between them, if
the invader lift it; or though the owner, meaning to save
it, cast it aside into some place, where the invader dis∣covers
and seizes it: for still the thing passes into his pos∣session
by means of the assault which he has made. Thus,
in the case of Anderson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1791.</NOTE> Paul and Bannatyne, one of the
articles charged to be taken from the person robbed, and
which led to the discovery of the pannels as the robbers,
was his hat, which had fallen from his head, in bringing
him to the ground, and was laid hold of by one of the as∣sailants.
And this the Court held to be an article of the
robbery, as much as their taking the money from his poc∣ket.
A plea of this sort was set up for Samuel Riccards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. and June 19. &amp; 20. 1710.</NOTE>
who argued, that to prevail on a woman by terror of his
threats, to deliver him a little money with her own hands,
was not robbery, but only concussion. No regard was paid
to this strange defence.</P>
<P>3. IN the construction also of the <HI>carrying away.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What a suffi∣cient carrying away</NOTE> the
same rule is to be observed as in the trial of simple theft;
that is to say, the crime is complete, as soon as any article
has fully passed into the hands of the invader, though he be
taken with it on the spot, the instant after; nay, in strict∣ness,
though from fear, or finding it not worth the keep∣ing,
he should instantly return the thing to the person rob∣bed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was determined in the English case of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat, tried at the Old Bailey in December 1781. The prisoner had taken Mr Downe's pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, but had re∣turned it, desiring him to keep the purse, if he valued it, and give him the con∣tents. But while Mr Downe was taking out the money, his servant jumped from behind the carriage, and secured the man. The Court determined this to be a robbery. Leach's Cases, p. 200.</NOTE>. The first of these points was settled, though con∣trary
<PB N="142" REF="201"/>
to the opinion of Lord Royston<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Royston's Notes, tit. Robbery, No. 4.</NOTE>, in the case of James
Cranstoun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10 &amp; 11. 1723.</NOTE> who had sentence of death for the taking of only
one article, with which he was apprehended on the spot, and
in presence of the person robbed.</P>
<P>4. THE taking and carrying away must be by invasion of
the person of another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Robbery without inva∣sion of the per∣son.</NOTE> This is not, however, to be under∣stood
in the literal sense, as if robbery could only be com∣mitted
by the taking of those things, which are upon the
person at the time, but in a loose and more general sense,
as applicable to whatsoever thing is under the perso∣nal
care and protection of the sufferer; so that unless by
force or terror to him applied, it cannot be taken away.
These things therefore amount to robbery; the taking of a
person's horse from him, as he travels on the highway, or
the horse of his servant who is attending him there, or his
portmanteau from behind his servant, (which charge was
accordingly found relevant in the case of Christopher Hog<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the pannell, his having, the time and place lybelled, at∣tacked George Sheriff, factor to the Earl of Hopetoun, and taking a clogbag from behind a servant of the said George Sheriff's that was riding with him, and predoniously carried away the samen, or was art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of death, and confiscation of moveables.”</NOTE>),
or the forcible taking of goods from a waggon which he is
conducting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. &amp; 21. and Dec. 12. 1720.</NOTE> or of sheep from among a flock which he is
driving on the road, or of goods from a ship which he has
charge of, whether in port, or stranded on the shore.</P>
<P>5. IT is another and an indispensible circumstance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What violence necessary to Robbery.</NOTE> that
the thing be taken by violence; for herein is the distinctive
<PB N="143" REF="202"/>
character of the crime. But in the construction of this
article, great latitude is used. There may be robbery
without any wounding or beating of the person, (which,
where it happens, may therefore be libelled as an aggrava∣tion,
as it was in the case of James Andrew);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 22. 1783.</NOTE> and also with∣out
any forcible wresting or tearing of the thing from the
person, or even any sort of struggle on the part of the suffer∣er
to detain it. The law only means to oppose this sort of
taking, as against the will of the owner, to that which hap∣pens
privately, or by surprise, (in neither of which is there
any application to the will or the fears of the sufferer), and
understands it therefore to be violence, if the thing is ta∣ken
by means of such behaviour and proceedings, as just∣ly
alarm for the personal and instant consequences of re∣sistance
or refusal. The mere display, therefore, of force,
and preparation of mischief, whether this appears in the
weapons shewn, in the number and combination of the as∣sailants,
or in their words, gestures, and demeanour, if on
the whole circumstances of the situation it may reason∣ably
intimidate and overawe, is a proper description of vio∣lence,
to found a charge of robbery. In the case of Ric∣cards,
already quoted, the interlocutor of relevancy is as
follows: “Find the pannel's having, the time libelled, <HI>in a
rude and violent manner,</HI> with a mortal weapon in his hand,
attacked Eliza<SUP>th</SUP> Bruce upon the highway libelled, and rob∣bed
from her money and goods, relevant to infer the pains
of death.” The libel in this case bore, that the woman,
being threatened, delivered what money she had upon her. On
the proof also against Stuart, Bannatyne, and Paul, who had
all of them sentence of death for one act of robbery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1791.</NOTE> it did not
appear that the assault was accompanied with show of arms,
nor with any sort of harm to the person robbed, farther than
<PB N="144" REF="203"/>
by pulling him to the ground, without a blow or other inju∣ry
of body.</P>
<P>MORE particularly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Robbery without having of arms.</NOTE> as to the showing or having of arms or
offensive weapons; whether this circumstance did or did not
make any difference in the Roman law, (for that is a dispu∣ted
point), it certainly is not material in ours, as appears
from the case of Barclay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. 1758.</NOTE> which issued in a capital convic∣tion,
notwithstanding the exception which on that ground
had been taken to the libel. The charge against Hugh
Lundie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 25. 1754.</NOTE> is, as to one act, thus, That he jumped over a wall
to a highway where two women were passing, “called out
to them, <HI>Damn you stand,</HI> and immediately thereafter, he
gripped the said Mary Burnet, put his hand in her pocket,
and took from thence 81/2d. Serling.” In another instance,
the libel relates the matter thus, That he overtook a woman
on the road, and addressed her, “demanding or asking six-pence
from her, to which she having answered, <HI>for what?</HI>
he thereupon gripped her, took hold of her pocket, and
robbed her of 2s. Sterling, being all the money she had
then upon her.” A third charge is for the robbery of
Elizabeth Allan, to whom the pannel had come up, “asking
of her if she had any money? to which she said, that she
had not, whereupon he forcibly laid hold of her pockets,
and took out thereof 2s. Sterling.” These charges were
found relevant, and the man was condemned and executed.
But it is not even necessary that there be, as in these instan∣ces,
a seizure of the person, and a taking by the hand of the
invader. All fear of danger, arising from a constructive vio∣lence,
which is gathered from the mode and circumstances
of the demand, being such as ordinarily carry awe and ter∣ror
with them, and may naturally<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>induce a man to surrender
<PB N="145" REF="204"/>
his property for the safety of his person, is sufficient to make
a taking <HI>against the will of the sufferer;</HI> which is the essence
of robbery.</P>
<P>IT seems however to be a point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fear of personal violence, if es∣sential to rob∣bery.</NOTE> which is at least worthy
of consideration, (though in England it has more than once
been determined against the prisoner<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See case of Daniel Hickman, July 1783; Patrick Donally, February 1779; and Samuel Gascoigne, October 1783. Leach's Cases in Crown Law, No. 124. 93. 125.</NOTE>), whether it will justify
the charge of robbery, that the delivery is made out of fear
of some other evil than personal and instant danger; as if
money be extorted from a person by means of threats to
set his house on fire, or to carry him to goal, or to bring a
charge of sodomy against him. The ground of distinction
seems to be this, that these are future dangers, against which
as the person assaulted has the means of protection from the
law, and otherwise; so, as a man of ordinary constancy, he is
bound to subdue the apprehension of them. Whereas, the
fear of instant and unavoidable injury to the person con∣strains
and justifies submission; on which account it is that
the law so severely punishes the offender, who proceeds
in that way. The best, but I shall not say a sufficient reply
to this objection, may seem to be, that the demand of mo∣ney
in these ways may sometimes be attended with such
circumstances, as beget a reasonable fear of present violence,
though not expressly threatened, in case of refusal to com∣ply;
and that the manner of the demand is truly no better
than a disguise, which will be thrown off as soon as oc∣casion
shall require. In whichever way that point shall be
settled, (with us it has not yet occurred), this at least will
not be the subject of controversy, that if the person only
<PB N="146" REF="205"/>
promises money at the time, and sends it afterwards, when
out of the reach of personal violence, and free of any in∣stant
terror, it is a crime of quite a different nature, as
much as where a person complies with the demand of an
incendiary letter.</P>
<P>6. IN the sixth and last place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thing must be taken feloni∣ously.</NOTE> robbery has this in common
with theft, that the thing must be taken with a felonious
intent; I mean on its own account, and with the purpose to
appropriate it, not being the property of the invader. Thus,
if John assault James to beat him, and in the struggle John
become master of James's staff and carry it off, this is not
a robbery; because the staff is not the object of the assault,
and if at all attended to at the time, is not taken with
an intention to keep it. This seems to have been the de∣scription
of the case of Edgar Wright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1788.</NOTE> where a pistol was
carried off in the course of a drunken squabble, and mutual
violence.</P>
<P>IT is immaterial in our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Place of taking is immaterial</NOTE> though it seems to be
otherwise in that of England, whether the thing be taken
on the highway, or elsewhere. When taken on the high∣way,
this circumstance, like the shewing of arms, or abuse
of the person, has sometimes been charged as an aggrava∣tion;
as in the case of John Irvine, 25th September 1744,
and Charles Ross, 23d February 1747. It is also immaterial
of what value the thing taken be; for though the value be
ever so little,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Value of the Thing taken is immaterial.</NOTE> the danger and terror of the mode of taking
make the robbery in every instance a capital offence, and
place the crime along with murder, rape, and fire-raising,
among the pleas of the Crown. This doctrine has never been
disputed, and is exemplified in many judgments of modern
<PB N="147" REF="206"/>
date. These are among the number; the case of Barclay,
31st July 1758, for robbing of a silver watch, of the value of
four guineas; of Thomas Hickton and Francis Simpson, 12th
March 1759, for robbing of a silver watch, worth four
pounds; of Robert Hay, 9th February 1767, for robbing
of a silver watch and forty shillings; of David and William
Dalgleish, 4th April 1780, for robbing of sive shillings and
a bundle of papers; of James Andrew, 22d December 1783,
for robbing of a silver watch; of Chalmers and Feagan, for
robbing of a gold watch, 8th April 1783. But the most re∣markable
of any is the case of James Cranston, in September
1723, where the one article by the verdict found to have
been taken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Verdict.</HI> “Find, That the pannel, on the day libelled, robbed Mr Charles Cockburn of his cane; also with one voice find the whole other circurastances proven in terms of the Lords their interlocutor.” The other circumstances here referred to were these, That the pannel was seen and heard to demand Mr Cockburn's money, with a pistol in his hand; that he was found standing by him, and threatened to shoot those who came up, and that Mr Cockburn, at this time, declared that he was robbed. These circumstances showed the felonious <HI>animus,</HI> but did not go to prove the taking of any article in addition to the cane.</P>
<P>The other capital cases of note are those of Robert Steedman, 11th February 1782; Gavin Lowrie, 18th March 1783; William Pickwith, 14th August 1771; all of them cases of conviction of repeated guilt.</P></NOTE>, was a walking staff or cane.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Same Act may be Robbery and House-breaking.</NOTE> it may not be amiss to observe, that
the same act may sometimes with propriety be charged both
as robbery, and under other denominations. In addition
to some instances of this which have already been taken
notice of, I will mention one more; the case of Robert Cal∣der,
against whom the charge was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1762.</NOTE> that he had entered a
lady's bed-chamber, in the night, by opening the casement
of a window, to which he ascended by a ladder, and that
<PB N="148" REF="207"/>
she being alarmed, he by threats and violence subdued her
resistance, and compelled her to deliver certain jewels which
were in the chamber at the time. Now this was both a
house-breaking, by the violent entry of the tenement, and
at the same time a robbery in the house, by the taking of
things from under the personal protection of the owner, and
by putting her in fear: It accordingly went to trial under both
denominations; but the pannel was acquitted. Perhaps the
most suitable term of any to be employed in such cases, is
our ancient, but of late neglected term of <HI>Stouthrief,</HI> or vio∣lent
theft, which embraces every sort of theft that is done
by open force, and in contempt of the possessors of the
things which are taken.</P>
<P>UNDER this description seems to fall that mode of theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Hership or Depredation.</NOTE>
not so necessary to be considered at large now, as in former
times, which was distinguished by the name of Hership or
Herdship; being the driving away of numbers of cattle,
or other <HI>bestial,</HI> by the masterful force of armed people.
This, according to Mackenzie, is the same offence with the
<HI>crimen abigeatus</HI> of the Roman law: but whether the cha∣racter
of the <HI>abigeus</HI> lay in his violent manner of depreda∣tion,
or in his habit of offending, and the quantity of his
spoil, (which is at least doubtful on the texts of the Ro∣man
law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See L. 1. 2. and 3. Dig. de Abigeis. Carpsov. Comm. ad. h. tit.—Also Voet, ej. Tit.</NOTE>), certain it is, that we need not resort to that
system, for authority to inflict a capital pain on the com∣mitter
of hership. For if the cattle are driven off in the
corporal presence of the owners or their people; as in the
case of Lauchlan Macintosh, who, in company with twen∣ty
<PB N="149" REF="208"/>
armed men, drove off three score oxen and seventeen cows,
and wounded the tenants and others who pursued them<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The assize “Finds the pannel L. Macintosh guilty and culpable of art and part of <HI>the robbing and stealing</HI> furth of the lands of Belshirie in June last, of three score oxen and cows, being the first article of the dittay; as also, they all in one voice cleanses the pannel of the robbing twa merchants, John Butter and John M'Robert, and of the haill remanent articles of the dittay, in respect they found the samen not sufficiently proven.”</NOTE>; and
as in the case of Donald Bain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 3. &amp; 10. 1722.</NOTE> who, with a band of twenty
armed men, drove off a herd of eighty-three cows, in pre∣sence
of the two keepers, whom they assaulted and bound;
this is an undoubted robbery; and as such it went to trial<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find that the pannel having at the time and place libelled, with a compa∣ny of armed men, <HI>robbed</HI> and carried off a herd of cattle; or, after carrying off the said cattle, when the pannel and his accomplices were pursued by a party of men, in order to rescue the said cattle, he the pannel did sire, or attempt to fire upon, or with his sword made resistance to the said party, or any one of them, or that the pannel was art and part of either of the foresaid alternatives, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of moveables, and repel the haill defences proponed for the pannel.” 10th Dec. 1722.</NOTE>
in these cases. But even when the taking happens out of the
presence of the owners, or their servants, who fly perhaps
on the approach of such a crew, it is still a case of violent
and masterful taking, or <HI>Brigancy,</HI> (as it is sometimes call∣ed),
and stouthrief, and not of simple theft; by reason of the
circumstances of open invasion and general alarm to the
neighbourhood, with which the spoil is committed. I shall
not enter into any farther discussion of the law concerning
those wasteful injuries, now almost unknown, though former∣ly
so frequent and so destructive, as obliged the Legislature
to have recourse to all manner of expedients, to repress them.
By one statute, (1587, c. 101.), the reparation of the loss is
laid on the captain or superior of the clan, within whose ter∣ritory
<PB N="150" REF="209"/>
the goods are received, shared, or disposed of: And
by another, (1581, c. 112.), the owners are empowered to
seize and detain, until reparation made, as well the body as
the goods of any person of the same clan to which the
offenders belong.</P>
<P>THESE seem to be the chief aggravations in the manner of
the particular act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft of Things sacred.</NOTE> which raise a theft to the degree of a
capital crime at common law. It does not appear that we
have any settled rule of punishing with death, the theft of
such things as are destined to sacred or religious uses; though
it is certainly an unfavourable circumstance to the pannel.
And it is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 6. 1556.</NOTE> that in the case of Adam Sinclair and Henry
Elderlous, convicted for breaking into the church of Forres,
and stealing chalices, priests ornaments, and gold and silver,
the one had sentence to be hanged, and the other to be
drowned; which, too, is expressed to be <HI>ex speciali gratia re∣ginae;</HI>
probably in lieu of some more cruel mode of death.</P>
<P>XVI. IN regard to those thefts which are punishable with
death by special statute;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutory capi∣tal Thefts.</NOTE> the list of them is very short, com∣pared
with that which has been found necessary in the situa∣tion
of England. Indeed I find but one enactment of this
kind (beside those, already mentioned, relative to stealing
from the mail), which, for certain, extends to this part of
the united kingdom. I allude to the act 18th Geo. II. c. 27.
by which it is made a capital offence to steal any linen, cot∣ton,
callico, or other stuff there mentioned, to the value of
ten shillings, from any bleaching-croft, or from any ground,
place, or building, made use of by any callico-printer, bleach∣er,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for printing, whitening, bleaching, or drying of the
same. The statute, however, bestows a discretion on the
<PB N="151" REF="210"/>
Judge, which with us has been liberally employed, of or∣dering
the offender to be transported for fourteen years,
in cases where he shall think it reasonable.</P>
<P>XVII. I HAVE now touched upon these things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Possession of sto∣len Goods, its Effect as Evi∣dence.</NOTE> which seem
chiefly to be observable, whether with respect to the descrip∣tion
or the punishment of theft. In the close of all, I shall
add a few words concerning that circumstance, by which,
more commonly than any other, the offender is detected,
and his guilt brought to light. I mean his possession of the
stolen goods. That this, by itself, shall in every case be
sufficient to conviction, would be too broad a position. Like
that of other circumstances, the weight of it may be great∣er
or less, according as the relative particulars in the
case happen to be. But, generally, it seems to be true,
that if the pannel is found in possession of the thing re∣cently
after it has been stolen, this, as it very much les∣sens
the likelihood of his having got it otherwise than by
stealing, is always a strong ingredient of evidence, and such
as if aided by any other circumstance of moment, will be
held a relevant ground of condemnation. If he has con∣fessed
upon examination, before a magistrate; if he is a per∣son
of evil fame, and pick-locks are found on him; if he of∣fers
money to the officers of justice, to let him escape; or if
he denies that he has the goods, and they are found in hid∣den
or unlikely places; any one of these particulars, joined
with his recent possession of the thing, and his inability to
show a fair way of coming by it, will serve to turn the ba∣lance
against him. This is the doctrine which results from
the interlocutors given in these, among many other cases,
which might be mentioned to the same effect: February

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF RESET OF THEFT.</HEAD>
<P>RESET OF THEFT is the receiving and keeping of stolen
goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RESET OF THEFT.</NOTE> knowing them to be such, and with the inten∣tion
to conceal them from the owner. And this offence
makes a proper sequel of those of theft and robbery, as being
<PB N="154" REF="213"/>
in some measure a continuation of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III.</NOTE> and that which by
its subserviency to the convenience of the thief, is one great
means of attaching him to his unlawful course of life.</P>
<P>1. IT is the fundamental circumstance in the description
of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resetter must be in Possession.</NOTE> that the stolen goods are received into the
offender's possession. That the person of the thief, ha∣ving
the stolen goods with him, is received and entertained
by one who knows him to be such, and also knows the
quality of the goods, is likewise a crime, but a different
one from reset of theft; which requires a special concern of
the resetter with the goods, a contrectation by him of the
things themselves, for the purpose of detention and conceal∣ment.
Not that there may not be proper reset, though the
thief continue in the house: for if the goods be once com∣mitted
to the peculiar care and keeping of the master of the
house, as by disposing of them about his person, locking
them up in his chest, or hiding them, with his knowledge or
connivance, in some secret place within his house, this is a
contrectation by him, and a clear ground of conviction. And
on this footing proceeded the interlocutor of relevancy in
the case of Anderson and others, in March 1701, and the
sentence of infamy and banishment upon John Tennant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Aug. 10. 11. 1714.</NOTE> in
the case of Hutchieson, Tennant, and others: for in both in∣stances
the thieves were taken in the resetter's house<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">As far as concerns Tennant, the verdict, is in these words: “Find, That John Tennant had the breeches and carabine libelled, and produced in Court, conceal∣ed in his house, and that he kept a public-house for travellers, proven; and finds the pocket-book▪ produced in Court, to have been concealed, and found upon the person of the said Tennant; but do not find the property thereof to be proven to be Robert Barr's.” These three articles were part of the goods stolen by the other pannels, Huchieson and Macdougall, who had sentence of death.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="155" REF="214"/>
rule, therefore, is only meant to be delivered thus; that to
harbour and entertain the thief, whether gratuitously, or for
reward as a publican, he keeping the goods under his own
exclusive care and custody, though with the knowledge of
the entertainer, will not involve that person as resetter.</P>
<P>BUT if the pannel receive the goods into his keeping, it
seems not to be material upon what footing, or by what
manner of covenant, this happens; whether for his own be∣hoof,
as upon pledge, purchase, or exchange of them, or
as depositary only for behoof of the thief. In either case,
he feloniously continues the detention of the property
from the owner, and does the same injury also to the public,
by securing to the thief the reward of his industry, and
heartening him in the trade.</P>
<P>As to the proof of the pannel's possession of the goods;
no other rule can well be laid down but this, that the
thing must be found in such circumstances, from which
it is presumable that it was not put there by servants or
others without his knowledge, but by himself, or with his
privity and connivance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. &amp; 15. 173<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> In the case of John and Eliza∣beth
Bell, the jury found a certain theft proved, “and that
part of the goods so stolen were found in the repositories
of the said pannels in their dwelling-house at Fala-dam; but
in regard the pannels were some considerable time absent
from their said house, before the said stolen goods were found
there, do not find it proven that the said pannels are guil∣ty,
art and part, in the stealing or resetting the said stolen
goods.”</P>
<P>2. IT does not seem to be a necessary circumstance of the
crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Reset∣ter receive di∣rectly from the Thief.</NOTE> that the thing have passed immediately from the
hands of the thief, into those of the resetter. When the
<PB N="156" REF="215"/>
prosecutor has proved the finding of the goods in the
possession of the culprit, and in such circumstances as pre∣sume
his knowledge of their theftuous quality, he has then
made out his case. And when the pannel shows in exculpa∣tion,
that he had them not from the thief himself, but from
another person, he still has not a relevant defence, unless
he at the same time show that he got them upon such a bar∣gain,
or from such a person, and on the whole in such a
manner, as outweighs the presumption against him, and
infers a lawful way of acquisition. For what if he had them
from some member of the family of the thief, or from a
confident of his, who got them from him to keep, but find∣ing
his house unsafe, and fearing a search, conveyed them
to the pannel. If, therefore, in the case of repeated chan∣ges
of hand, the charge of reset is apt to fail, it is not be∣cause
it is incompetent in these circumstances, but by reason
of the difficulty of the proof, and of the weaker grounds of
suspicion, generally speaking, which that situation affords.</P>
<P>3. THE possession must be set forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resetter must know that they are stolen Goods.</NOTE> as that which is held in
the knowledge of the vicious quality of the thing; where∣in
lies the entire wrong of the act, and the substance of the
charge. Bare suspicion, therefore, of the fact, or that the
possessor had reasonable cause to doubt whether his author
had acquired the things lawfully, is no relevant ground of
conviction of this crime: because in such matters the at∣tention
and sagacity of one man is so different from that of
another; and though a person may be blameable, he is not,
however, to be punished, on account of pure heedlessness
or indiscretion.</P>
<P>To require,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving his Knowledge.</NOTE> however, that the resetter's knowledge of the
quality of the things shall be proved by direct testimony
<PB N="157" REF="216"/>
to the disclosure of the theft to him, would be little less than
to secure him of impunity; because ordinarily, from the
very nature of the situation, no such evidence is to be had:
nay, from the jealousy and caution so natural to people of
this sort, it will often happen, that no express communi∣cation
ever takes place on the subject. The common and
relevant mode of proof is therefore by circumstances of
real evidence; such as the concealment of the goods in
hidden places, the denial of them to the officers of justice
upon their search, the attempt to disguise them by altera∣tion
or effacing of marks, the low price paid for them, the
inconsistent accounts given of the manner of getting them,
and the quality of the goods themselves, being such as those
from whom they were got could not honestly have obtain∣ed:
of all which it is a powerful confirmation, if the pan∣nel
himself or his author, is of evil fame as a resetter or
thief. Among other interlocutors which have been given
on this principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27. &amp; 29. 1726.</NOTE> notice may be taken of that in the case of
Ludovick More, Duncan, and Robertson<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, That any of the houses or shops libelled having been broken, and out thereof goods and effects stolen, and the said stolen goods, or part thereof, having been found in some secret and concealed places, within or about the said pannel (Ludovick More's) house, <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer the pains aforesaid; and find, That soon after the said shops, or any of them, were broke open, and out thereof goods stolen, as said is, the said Andrew Duncan and James Robert∣son, pannels, were apprehended at Belshiell, and in their custody and possession were found jilts, false keys, or pick-locks; and that they, the said pannels, when brought before the Sheriff-substitute of Lanark, did confess, that they had, about the time libelled, broke open any of the saids shops, or that they were known to dispose of any of the goods stolen out thereof, <HI>separatim</HI> rele∣vant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” The verdict was thus as to Duncan and Robertson: “Finds proven, That soon after the shops in Hamilton, libel∣led, were broke open, and out thereof goods were stolen, the said Andrew Dun∣can and James Robertson were apprehended at Belshiell, and in the custody and possession of the said Andrew Duncan were found jilts, false keys, and pick∣locks, and that both the said pannels, when brought before the Sheriff-substitute of Lanark, did confess that they had about the time libelled broke open the said shops at Hamilton.”</NOTE>; who were in con∣sequence
<PB N="158" REF="217"/>
convicted, and adjudged to be transported, for
their respective guilt as thieves and resetter.</P>
<P>4. ANOTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resetter must possess feloni∣ously.</NOTE> and no less indispensible quality of the pos∣session
is, that it be felonious,—with a purpose of detaining
the thing from the owner; because it may happen, though
it cannot be a frequent case, that a person is knowingly in
possession of stolen goods with an innocent, or even a meri∣torious
intention. But, ordinarily, the vicious purpose will
be presumable, from the same circumstances of evidence
which establish the pannel's knowledge of the quality of
the goods; so that when this has been proved, it will ra∣ther
lie with him to substantiate, in the way of exculpation,
and as he best may, the innocent or laudable view of his
wittingly detaining the stolen property of another.</P>
<P>5. IN these several articles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reset sometimes near a-kin to Theft.</NOTE> the crime of reset has a near
agreement with that of theft: And this, in some instances,
may rise so high, as to make it matter of debate, whether
the reset does not argue, and in fact amount to a participa∣tion
of the theft itself. If two pick-pockets are plying their
trade in different quarters of a market-place, and one of
them runs off with a purse, and in passing conveys it to the
other, who keeps and carries it away; this resetter, if he is
to be called so, is truly art and part of the theft: because
he is there to assist if there shall be occasion for it; he is
<PB N="159" REF="218"/>
privy to the time and circumstances of the particular fact;
and is concerned in, and continues the immediate act of re∣moving
the thing from the owner's power. The same seems
to be true, if a person, having stolen a pack of goods from a
waggon on the street, shall straightway repair with it to the
neighbouring house of a known thief<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Anne Robertson was charged with theft and reset, 5th July 1717, on this narrative: That James Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at having stolen a box, from a cart on the street of Edinburgh, he ran with it, straight-way, to her house; where, after he had told her how he came by it, she took him to a private place in the house, broke open the box, and got a share of the contents. There is this <HI>passage in the information for the prosecutor:</HI> “The lawyers for Anne Robertson contended, that the fact laid against her inferred only reset of theft, and not theft itself, and therefore, before she could be found guilty of reset, the theft itself ought first to be pro∣ven.”</P>
<P>“To which it being answered, that the libel as to her being complex, both as to reset and theft, the Lords by their interlocutor found, that by dividing the goods in her house, and in her presence, and drawing her share thereof, there needed no theft be previously proven in order to infer the resetting upon her; and accordingly the debate proceeded against her as <HI>guilty of the theft, or art and part,</HI> as well as Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, seeing it was offered to be proven, that she ac∣tually drew her share of the goods.” There is, however, no such interlocutor in the record: Probably it was only the expression of an opinion. An act of in∣demnity prevented any farther trial.</P></NOTE>, who bestows it in his
secret repository, and afterwards receives part of the con∣tents
for his assistance. In these and the like situations, ow∣ing
to the continuity and near connection of the two acts,
they are considered but as one; and the receiver, by his
concern in <HI>the particular deed,</HI> is held to be not only such,
but more properly an accessory to the theft itself. Perhaps,
though he has not fully explained himself, it is to acts of this
description that Mackenzie applies the term of <HI>immediate re∣set</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Theft-Boot, No. 7.</NOTE>,
in that passage where he says that it is punishable as theft.
<PB N="160" REF="219"/>
Be this as it may, it is certain with respect to those cases,
where the immediate receiving of the stolen goods is coupled
to a <HI>previous knowledge</HI> of the particular deed, and to <HI>any
sort of assistance</HI> lent towards the perpetration of it, that
the charge of reset can with no propriety be made use of.
This I shall illustrate by the case of Anderson and Marshall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25. and Dec. 3. 4. 1728.</NOTE>
Anderson was a vagabond or gypsey. Marshall kept a house
of resort for vagabonds. And both were charged as art and
part of a robbery committed on Bailie Rule, early in the
morning, upon the highway near Marshall's house. It
appeared that Anderson and other gypsies were lodged in
Marshall's barn on the night of the robbery, and that Mar∣shall
knew of Rule's intention to pass that way with a sum
of money, and communicated this to Anderson. Anderson
rose in the night from among his comrades, then asleep in the
barn, stepped out at a window, almost naked, and having rob∣bed
Rule a short way off, returned to his quarters; where he
threw in his staff at the window. At this moment, those with∣in
heard Anderson in conversation with Marshall; Anderson
desiring him to take care of the money, and Marshall assu∣ring
him, “that it was as safe as his shirt.” These were the
chief features of the case; upon which the Court found it
relevant to infer death and confiscation of moveables against
Marshall, “his having been guilty, art and part, of the fore∣said
robbery, by outhounding, resetting, or ratihabiting
the same.” He was accordingly found “guilty, art and
part, of said robbery, by outhounding and resetting;”
and had sentence of death along with Anderson.</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Possession; if presumed to be as Thief or Re∣setter.</NOTE> it may sometimes be matter of debate,
upon the possession of the goods as proved, whether it infers
guilt of theft or of reset, Now, as to this; in every case,

the whole circumstances of the fact are to be weighed. But
in general, if there be nothing farther to elucidate, the mat∣ter,
and more especially with respect to those cases, where
the time and place of finding are not remote from the time
and place of theft, so as to give countenance to the belief
of a change of hands; there seems to be no ground in law
for presuming that the pannel has the thing as resetter, ra∣ther
than as thief. Or rather there seems to be reason for pre∣suming
the other way; because if he truly got the thing
from another person, he has it in his power to show this;
and with him, in these circumstances, the burden naturally
lies of proving this, or any other defence, that is exclusive
of the charge of theft. On this ground judgment seems to
have gone in the case of Murdison and Miller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 89.</NOTE> in which the
verdict was considered by the Court as a special <HI>finding</HI> of
the several facts of possession, effacing of marks, and the
like, which are related in the libel.</P>
<P>6. NEXT of the pains of this offence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reset, how pu∣nishable.</NOTE> By the old statute
of Alexander II. c. 21. the resetter was to be held and punish∣ed
as the thief<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“<HI>Quicunque furtum ablatum sciens suscepit, in numero furum furantium ha∣beatur, et simili vindictae teneatur subjacere.</HI>”</NOTE>. And Mackenzie has said, that this is still
the law with respect to that fort of reset<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Theft-Boot, No. 7.</NOTE>, but not very well
explained by him, to which he gives the name of immediate.
Also it is certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1701.</NOTE> that in the case of Anderson, Fraser, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the
libel was found relevant to infer death, as well against An∣derson,
who was charged with reset only, as against Fraser,
<PB N="162" REF="221"/>
who broke the house, and brought the goods to him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The charge is against Anderson as resetter only. After relating the house∣breaking, as committed by Fraser, Duff, and Millar; the libel proceeds thus: “All which stolen goods were receipt by the said Alexander Anderson in his house near Snelup, where the said William Fraser, Thomas Duff, and William Millar were apprehended within two days thereafter, having the said stolen goods in their custody as they were divided among them.” The interlocutor “finds the same (libel) relevant against <HI>Fraser and Anderson</HI> to infer the pain of death.” The other pannels were boys; and as to them the relevancy was limited to an arbitrary pain. Anderson was not convicted.</NOTE>. I
find too, that in seveval of the older pleadings, the two of∣fences
are cursorily spoken of, as being of the same degree,
and punishable with equal pains.</P>
<P>YET I cannot discover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reset, how pu∣nishable.</NOTE> that in any one instance, judg∣ment
of death has passed on a resetter, not even on a com∣mon
resetter, and much less for a single offence. And
not only so; but sundry cases are to be found where the
distinction is made between the thief and the resetter,
by inflicting death on the one, and only arbitrary pain on
the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1714.</NOTE> This, was done in the case of Tennant, who
had sentence of banishment and infamy, for resetting the
goods in his house, which Hutchieson and Macdougal were,
upon the same libel, condemned to die for stealing. The
like rule of judgment was followed in the case of Archibald
Stewart and Charles Gordon:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1785.</NOTE> For Stewart had sentence of
death, being convicted of two acts of house-breaking; and
Gordon, convicted of resetting the articles, and to a great va∣lue,
carried off from one of these houses, was scourged, and
transported for seven years. It is to be observed too of
both cases, that the reset was in the course of the same night
In which the things were stolen. A still stronger instance
occurred in a trial at Jedburgh, before the Lords Hailes
and Henderland, in September 1786. This verdict was re∣turned
against John Clerk and Thomas Martin, indicted for
<PB N="163" REF="222"/>
stealing and resetting horses: “Find the said John Clerk
guilty of stealing and carrying away all and every one of
the mares and horses mentioned in the said criminal libel:
Find it not proven, That the said <HI>Thomas Martin</HI> is guilty
as actor, or art and part, of stealing and carrying away any
of the foresaid horses; but by a plurality of voices find it
proven, That the said Thomas Martin is guilty of reset of
theft as to the <HI>horses</HI> mentioned in the said criminal libel,
which were stole and carried off by the said John Clerk
from <HI>William Wilson and sisters, Robert Wingate, Andrew El∣liot,
and James Thorburn.”</HI> Now, on this verdict, which,
as to Martin, is a conviction of four acts of resetting stolen
goods of some value, that pannel had sentence to be scourged
and transported, at the same time that Clerk, the thief, had
sentence of death.</P>
<P>IT is a confirmation on the same side, that in the case of Mur∣dison
and Miller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 89.</NOTE> the opinions of the Judges assume and im∣ply,
though they do not directly lay it down, that reset of
theft, and even repeated reset, (for such in this case it would
have been), is the lower crime, and only liable to arbitrary
pain. Moreover, notice may be taken of the statute 1587,
c. 110. touching <HI>the sellers of gudes pertaining to malefactors,</HI>
which punishes those offenders, who seem to be at least a-kin
to resetters, with banishment only and confiscation of move∣ables.
Taken together, these things conspire to beget a doubt,
whether, for proper reset, and although guilty of repeated
acts, a person may warrantably be punished with death; and
whether those authorities, which may be alleged on the other
side, are not rather to be understood as applicable to such
cases only, where the pannel may be considered as also art
and part of the theft. In itself too, such a distinction
in the punishment of these crimes seems to be a reasonable
<PB N="164" REF="223"/>
thing. For though the one course of life may be little less
pernicious than the other, which it so much forwards and
encourages, yet there is a material difference of boldness
and wickedness between the actual enterprise of theft, and
the mere keeping of things which have already been taken
away<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">On the 4th March 1751, Richard Begbic, convicted of three acts of reset, on his own confession, was sent to the correction-house for three months, and ba∣nished Scotland.</NOTE>. That the highest arbitrary pain may be inflicted,
is not the subject of dispute.</P>
<P>IF it were even true that the thief and resetter may some∣times
be punished alike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reset, how pu∣nishable.</NOTE> yet still a distinction would be ne∣cessary
to be observed with respect to those thefts which
are attended with aggravations. For whether the aggrava∣tion
be by the habite and repute, or the repeated guilt of the
thief, or even by the violent or deliberate manner of the
particular act, these are qualities which affect the thief only,
and not the resetter; whose act of detaining the stolen goods
is distinct from the theft, and who, though he understand
in general that the thing is <HI>res furtiva,</HI> may, however, be
utterly ignorant of the particular way in which it was sto∣len.
The resetter, therefore, and his act, must be judged
in this respect by their own proper qualities, according to
the value and nature of that which he has resetted, the re∣petition
of the act, and the fame and repute of the man.</P>
<P>7. Now a few words respecting the prosecution of the
resetter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resetter, can he be tried before the Thief.</NOTE> which, according to Mackenzie, cannot take place
till after conviction of the principal thief<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Theft-Boot, No. 4.</NOTE>. That, in a
<PB N="165" REF="224"/>
certain sense, such a rule had once been received, seems in∣deed
to be sufficiently vouched. It is laid down generally
in the statutes of David II. c. 29. <HI>de receptatore alicujus ma∣lefactoris,</HI>
that he shall not be tried till after the malefactor.
And in the case of John Currour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16. 1587.</NOTE> indicted for resetting sto∣len
sheep, this plea being moved, “The Justice fand the
same relevant.” It is again sustained in the case of John
Douglas and Agnes Mustard his spouse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1623.</NOTE> and still more point∣edly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 19. 1634.</NOTE>
in the case of James Clerk, “brouster at the West Port
of Edinburgh,” where the Justice finds, “That be the
inviolabill practique of this judgment, the principal steal∣er
man be first discussit before the receipter can be con∣venit.”</P>
<P>THESE judgments were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resetter, can he be tried before the Thief.</NOTE> however, all of them given under
certain modifications, as relative to the case of the principal
thief being known, and neither brought to trial, nor even
called and outlawed. The argument in the case of Douglas
carries the plea no farther, and the Justice assigns his reason
for his interlocutor, “in respect nae diligence is usit against
the said Margaret Ahannay,” who was the principal thief.
The restraint, therefore, went only thus far, that the thief,
if known and in custody, was in the first place to be brought
to trial; and if not in custody, was to be outlawed for non∣compearance.
But that if the thief were unknown, or were
dead, or were abroad, or could not be taken, the resetter was
to escape unpunished; this would not have been reasonable
in itself; nor does it appear from our records, that any such
rule was ever established<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In the case of Graham, 18th December 1663, to which Mackenzie refers as a confirmation of the rule, the verdict was rescinded on a quite separate ground. <HI>viz.</HI> That it was disconform to the charge; the one being for theft, and the other for reset.</P>
<P>This question was again debated in the case of Francis Mellum, 21st February 1676. But there “The Lords declare, that they do not give answer to the de∣fence founded on reset of theft, because it is not libelled in the subsumption.”</P></NOTE>. Such as the rule was, it has
<PB N="166" REF="225"/>
long been thus far relaxed in practice, that the thief and re∣setter
may be tried at the same time, and upon one libel:
as was done in the case of Anderson and others in 1701; of
Ludovick More in 1726; of Stewart and Gordon in 1785; of
Clerk and Martin in 1786. It is also competent, (and in
this course the objection is in a great measure avoided), to
lay the libel with an alternative charge of theft and reset,
or one or other of them, as in the opinion of the jury the
fact shall turn out to be. This was done in the case of
Murdison and Miller, in 1773, and in that of Macdonald
and Jamieson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. 1770.</NOTE> where it was objected, that such a charge
was inept and inconsistent. But this objection was repelled.</P>

whether it be done from malice or misapprehension of
right, that it is cognisable with us as a crime at common law;
if it be done, as ordinarily happens, with circumstances of
tumult and disorder, and of contempt and indignity to the
owner. For instance: to enter a person's lands with a
convocation of servants and dependants, and cast down the
houses, or root out or spoil the woods, or throw open and
deface the inclosures; to break down in the same fashion
the sluices and aqueducts of a mill; to break or burn
the boats and nets at a fishery; to tear and destroy the
peats, turf, and feuel, in a heath or moss; all these are com∣petent
articles of dittay. The same is even true of the
bare usurpation of possession, though without any great da∣mage

done to the property,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV.</NOTE> if it be accomplished by the
show of a masterful force; so as to have in it a mixture of
<HI>riot,</HI> as well as of <HI>molestation</HI> or intrusion.</P>
<P>THE casting down of houses was found relevant in the
case of Donald and Charles Robertsons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. &amp; 9. 1671.</NOTE> And it was again

was also the charge of tumultuoussly intruding into the pos∣session
of the pursuer's lands, threatening his herds, beating

the turf to build folds, and other the like acts. In the

that, with an armed force, he had intruded himself into
possession of the house of Castlegrant,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords “Find, That the pursuer, having the possesstion of the house of Castlegrant, by having the keys thereof, and by having his furniture and ser∣vants there, and the said Mungo Grant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their or either of their going, about the time libelled, and entered the house of Castlegrant with armed men, and refusing the pursuer access thereto, relevant to infer an arbitrary punis∣hment and damages.” This action was after wards deserted.</NOTE>, and excluded the

<P>ON the 13th July 1730, Henry Trotter of Mortonhall,
Was prosecuted by Lord Sommerville, for causing his ser∣vants
Violently beat down part of the pursuer's seat, or lost
In the church of Libberton; which appears to have been
done on account of the alleged encroachment on the seat
Which belonged to the pannel<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>20th July 1730. “Find, That Henry Trotter of Mortonhall, pannel, having ordered his servants, or others, to beat down a seat or lost, or any part thereof, built by or for the behoof of James Lord Sommerville, pursuer; and the servants, or others, so ordered by the pannel, having, at the time and place libelled, violently beat down the said seat or lost, or any part thereof, or that the pannel was art and part of the premisses, relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment.”</P>
<P>The libel begins thus; “That where by the laws of this and all other well governed realms, all riots, and violent invasion of property of possession, and atrocious real injuries, such as the pulling or beating down with axes, ham∣mers, or such other like instruments, the seats and lofts in churches belonging to any of our subjects, or decorements put upon them for the decent adorning of the said seats, lofts, or churches, in a riotous, masterful, and lawless manner, by assembling any number of persons together, armed with the instruments a∣foresaid, which might have occasioned tumults and great disorders, and had fatal consequences, are crimes of a high nature,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It appears, that the act which gave occasion to this libel, was the pulling down of a Dorick pilaster in Lord Sommerville's seat, which, as Mortonhall alleged, en∣croached upon his seat. It was aggravated, in being done a day or two before the dispensation of the sacrament.</P></NOTE>. The pursuer had a favour∣able<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. and Aug. 4. 1730.</NOTE>
<PB N="171" REF="230"/>
verdict; and the pannel paid L. 100, of fine, damages,
and expences.</P>
<P>THESE may serve as a specimen of the course of practice
in times past, (for of late years the civil courts have more
commonly been resorted to for redress of such injuries),
with respect to violent or tumultuous molestation, intrusion,
or invasion of property.</P>
<P>UPON the whole of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of Re∣levancy in such Cases.</NOTE> these things seem to be obser∣vable.
1. It will not acquit the pannel, that there is a con∣troversy
between him and the pursuer concerning the mat∣ter
of patrimonial right, (as happened in every one of the
instances which have been quoted,) and that he proceeded
in the belief of a civil wrong, previously committed by
that person against him. For he is not excusable in forgetting
that the courts of law are open to his complaint. 2. It is
grounded in the same reason, namely, the due regard to the
order and tranquillity of Society, that the pannel shall
equally be convicted, whether it be that he interferes with
the property of another, or only with his state of peaceable
and lawful-possession. For neither is this to be broken but by
the order of law. This rule especially appears upon the terms
of the interlocutor in the case of Monro. 3. That which law
in such debates chiefly regards, is not so much the patri∣monial
damage sustained, (which in most of these instances
<PB N="172" REF="231"/>
was but trifling,) as the insult both to the public and the in∣dividual,
by the violence and tumult with which the thing
is done. Hence, on occasion of the above controversy be∣tween
Rigg and Trotter, the latter having recriminated, un∣der
the pretence that Rigg had raised the turf for his bow∣ling-green
from a spot of land which belonged to Trotter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1714.</NOTE>
but without specifying any circumstance of violence or dis∣order;
this was held to resolve into a question of trespass,
or controverted marches, and to be no relevant ground of
a criminal charge. In like manner, upon a libel against Sir
James Dunbar and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 11. 1714.</NOTE> which bears a charge of sundry
usurpations and iniquities committed by the pannels, one
article is dismissed for this reason, that no qualification of
violence is set forth<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As also, find the second article, <HI>viz.</HI> That Forsyth did by himself, or by order of Sir James Dunbar, possess a part of the lands set to the pursuer, and wherein the pursuer had been in possession, not relevant in a criminal process, <HI>no violence being libelled,</HI> without prejudice of any civil action as accords.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS limitation is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poisoning of cattle, sheep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> however, only applicable to the case
of inconsiderable injuries to property, or to such as may
have been done by the pannel under the misapprehension of
right. For if any one go and poison his neighbour's dogs,
sheep, or cattle, or mangle them by cutting out their tongues,
breaking their limbs, or the like, certainly this is a crime,
and punishable with severe pains, though he proceed ever so
secretly in the execution of his wrongful and malicious
purpose. Nay, I find that for the poisoning of poultry,
Thomas Bellie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5. 1600.</NOTE> burgess of Brechin, came in the King's will,
and was banished under pain of death; having mixed
arsenic with dough, and thrown it down in the court-yard
of his neighbour, Janet Clerk, to poison her fowls; whereby
some of them were killed.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="232"/>
THIS judgment proceeded on the common law. But in
certain instances of wilful mischief, which are more alarm∣ing
by the high damage which attends them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houghing of cattle, breaking of ploughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> or by their
frequency, and the ease with which they may be done, it
has been thought proper to strengthen the protection of the
common law, and to deter the malicious by the dread of a
higher and statutory pain. This is true of the breaking or
destroying of ploughs, or plough-gear, in time of tilth; of
the killing, goring, or houghing of oxen, horses, or other
cattle, at the same season, or in time of harvest-labour; and
of the breaking and destroying of mills; all of which of∣fences
are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1581, c 110. 1587, c. 83.</NOTE> by these statutes, punishable as theft, and with
the pains of death. The phrase of “uther cattel,” which
is used in the first of these laws, was, in one instance, ap∣plied
to the killing of sheep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 20. 1616.</NOTE> and three persons, George, Wal∣ter,
and Ingram Scott, were, in consequence, condemned to
die. But it may be doubted, whether this is a found con∣struction
of that statute, which, even with respect to the
kinds that are expressly mentioned in it, seems only to be
applicable to the seasons of labour. Other statutes, which
make the like provisions as to the killing of game, the cut∣ting
of trees, the breaking of dovecotes, and the like, were
formerly taken notice of under the head of theft.</P>
<P>II. BUT by far the most important article which falls under
the general head of malicious mischief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of wilful Fire-raising.</NOTE> is the crime of wilful
fire-raising; to which I have assigned a place in this Chapter,
as ordinarily intended to do a patrimonial injury, though it
may be, and sometimes, but more rarely, hath been direc∣ted
against life and person too. Take it in any view, it is
always a crime of the first degree; on account of the dread∣ful
and extensive waste it may occasion, the great terror and
<PB N="174" REF="233"/>
alarm which attend it, the impossibility of guarding against
it, and the pure and deliberate malice of the contrivance
and way of execution.</P>
<P>THE laws of all countries have therefore consented in
dooming the fire-raiser to death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-raising.</NOTE> as well as those of several
have ordered him to perish in some uncommon and more
cruel mode of execution. The Roman law, if he were a person
of low condition, allowed him to be exposed to wild beasts;
and in certain other cases, “<HI>igni necari jubetur</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 9. et 12. dig. De Incendio, &amp;c. L. 28. No. 12. dig. De Poenis.</NOTE>.” This
sort of retaliation was also adopted in the laws of the Visi∣goths,
and of some others of the barbarous nations; with re∣spect
to him at least who raised fire within a town or village.
The same law was proclaimed for the German empire, by a
constitution of Charles V.; and, as Carpsovius says, it was
the general rule of his time in Saxony, for fire-raisers of eve∣ry
degree and condition<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Leg. Visig. lib. 8. tit. 2. No. 1. Carpsov. quaest. p. 225.</NOTE>, “<HI>igne cremandos esse.</HI>”</P>
<P>WITH us in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-raising.</NOTE> we find that the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI>
likened the crime of fire-raising to that of murder, and or∣dered
that it should in all points be proceeded in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. c. 6.</NOTE> treated, and
brought to issue as such. But not content with this severity,
which had proved insufficient in those disorderly times, the
Legislature, first by statute 1426, c. 75. and afterwards, more
fully, by statute 1528, c. 8. raised the crime of fire-raising, at
least in certain cases, to the rank of treason. “The auld
lawes, (it says), shall be keeped with this addition, that
quha cummis and burnis folkes in their houses, and all
<PB N="175" REF="234"/>
burninges of houses and cornes, and wilfull fire-raisings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRERAISING.</NOTE>
be treason, and crime of lese majestie.”</P>
<P>OWING,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-raising.</NOTE> either to inadvertency, or to some reason which
cannot now be assigned, this act was not printed in the
Black Acts, or first edition of our statutes; which omission to
supply, special order was given to print it, by the statute
1567, c. 32. And thus it happens, that in all the later editions,
this law is found inserted both in its proper place, as a sta∣tute
of the year 1528, and also as a renewed act of the year
1567, being the act immediately following that which gives
order for the printing. But in this renewed form, the law
is inaccurately given, both as being referred to the year 1526,
in which there was no Parliament, and by the omission of
the words “and all burninges of houses;” whereby the sense
of the enactment is maimed and confounded. This is the
more material to be taken notice of, as Mackenzie in what
he says of this crime, having attended only to the renewed,
and not to the genuine statute, has been led into difficulties,
and indeed mistakes, respecting the extent and application
of the law.</P>
<P>BESIDE these two, there is an intermediate statute, the
act 1540. c. 118., which chiefly relates to the burning of corn
in stacks or barns, and on the whole seems to have been in∣tended,
not for taking away the pains of treason formerly
ordained, (as Lord Royston supposed), but for disabling the
King to pardon the offenders in this sort, or even to com∣mute
the lawful pains of their transgression for any thing
less than banishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Royston's Notes, No. 10. tit. Fire-raising.</NOTE>. It is not clear, that this was even
meant to be a perpetual law; and we know, that it was no
better observed than those other statutes which made the
<PB N="176" REF="235"/>
like provisions with respect to murder, and other acts of
violence to which those times were addicted.</P>
<P>THE pains of treason were afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-raising.</NOTE> by statute 1592,
c. 148. extended to the burning of coal-heughs. But by the
act of the 7th Anne, c. 21. the last which relates to the
pains of this offence, and the same which extends the Eng∣lish
treason-law to Scotland, fire-raising, in all the instances
which had been raised to the rank of treason, was again
lowered to the ordinary condition of a capital offence, and
was ordered to be proceeded in and tried as such.</P>
<P>So standing the law as to the punishment of fire-raising,
let us next attend to the character and lawful description of
the crime.</P>
<P>1. WE have to remark the distinction between the pro∣per
and capital crime of fire-raising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime requires actual burning.</NOTE> and the attempt to
commit it; which lies in this, that the fire must not only be
applied, but applied with success, to that which is meant to
be destroyed. Though our opinion of the offender may be
the same, it is not however sufficient authority in law for
passing sentence of death on him, that he has taken the last
step, and done his utmost towards the perpetration of his
wickedness, as by kindling his matches, and tossing them
among the corn, or upon the roof of the house; if in fact
his destructive purpose has not been accomplished. Probab∣ly
it was on this account, that no sentence followed in the
case of Barbara Phinnick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 8. 1670.</NOTE> who, as appears from the proof,
being left alone in her master's house, had torn a bed-quilt,
and placed it under a bed, with a burning candle in the
middle of it, and had then gone abroad and locked the
doors, with intent certainly to destroy the house: but which
<PB N="177" REF="236"/>
purpose failed to take effect, neither the bed being set fire
to, (owing to a bed-tick of leather), nor even the bed-quilt
being quite consumed, and the boards of the floor only be∣ginning
to be touched, when the discovery was made<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The jury however found her guilty “of raising of fire within the house of James Stamfield.”.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT this rule equally requires to be guarded on the other
side:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of any Part is sufficient.</NOTE> for we should form a very false, and no less unreason∣able
notion of the law, if we should conceive that there is no
fire-raising without the absolute and complete destruction of
the thing or tenement, to which the fire is put. Certainly
the crime is as much committed, if one stack in the barn∣yard,
or any distinct portion of the house is destroyed, as if
the whole were consumed, according to the pannel's in∣tention.
This position, (if there be occasion for authori∣ties
to confirm it), is announced in the interlocutor in the
case of Stuart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. 1713. Oct. 21. 1720.</NOTE> Mill, and Brodie, as also in that of William
and Alexander Fraser.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>“And <HI>separatim</HI> find their setting fire to the said house of Inchdruer, by which the same <HI>or part thereof</HI> was burned, also at the time foresaid, likewise relevant to infer the pain of death.” Interlocutor in the case of Stuart, 3<SUP>d</SUP> August 1713.</P>
<P>In the case of Frasers, “Find the said William Fraser <HI>alias</HI> Oig, and Alex∣ander Fraser <HI>alias</HI> Oig, pannels, or either of them, their having, the time li∣belled, wilfully set fire to Mr Patrick Robertson's barn, or corns in his barn∣yard, whereby the said barn or corns, <HI>or part of them,</HI> were burnt or consu∣med, &amp;c. relevant to infer the pain of death.” 7<SUP>th</SUP> November 1720.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT only so;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sufficient, if fire be <HI>raised.</HI></NOTE> but in the judgment of law, the pannel
shall be held to be guilty of no lower crime, though no stack
<PB N="178" REF="237"/>
in the barn-yard, nor chamber of the tenement be consu∣med,
if, properly speaking, the fire hath once laid hold of,
or been <HI>raised</HI> in the premisses; so as to occasion alarm for
their safety, and put them in plain danger of the farther
progress of the flames<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“Accedente periculo incendii majoris, quod facillime evenire potuisset, licet im∣pediente Deo non evener it.”</P>
<P>Absque dubio igitur poena ignis quoque reo est in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligenda, si per incendium, par∣vum et minimum damnum illatum, et ignis eo ipso momento, dum urere ac aedes in∣flammare coeperit, rursum fucrit extinctus.” <HI>Carpsovius, Quaest. p. 228. No.</HI> 39.</P></NOTE>. For, as the very appellation of the
crime indicates, it is not the crime of burning, or destroy∣ing
by fire, but of fire-<HI>raising;</HI> and agreeably to that stile
the statute 1528 not only declares all “<HI>burnings</HI> of houses and
corns,” but also that “wilful <HI>fire-raisings</HI>” shall be treason.
If therefore the fire hath once fastened on the subject, and
is only by timely discovery prevented from spreading far∣ther,
the capital offence is here committed, though no ma∣terial
damage has ensued. This was the description of the
case of Margaret Nicolson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. and Aug. 16. 1711.</NOTE> who was charged to have kind∣led
fire, but which was almost instantly discovered and ex∣tinguished,
in three different parts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatched roof of
her master's house. But the prosecutor restricted his con∣clusions
to an arbitrary pain; and the pannel agreed to be
transported.</P>
<P>2. THE only other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fire must be raised wilfully</NOTE> but an indispensible quality of the act,
as being that circumstance wherein the guilt of it entirely
lies, is that the fire be raised wilfully; that is to say out of
malice, and on purpose to do a neighbour harm. If it be
kindled <HI>recklessly,</HI> or from <HI>misgovernance,</HI> according to the
phrase of the old statute 1426, c. 75. the greatest severity
that can be used, beside levying the damage from the faulty
<PB N="179" REF="238"/>
person, is to inflict a sine or short imprisonment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">That statute appoints banishment for three years from the burgh. But this was a regulation of police, suited to the great danger of fire in those times, when houses were mostly of wood and thatch.</NOTE>. Nor is
even this censure warrantable, unless the fault be of that
high degree, <HI>“ut luxuriae aut dolo sit proxima,”</HI> L. 11. <HI>dig. de incendio.</HI></P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the wilful purpose.</NOTE> the prosecutor has peculiar difficulties to contend
with, in proving this the fundamental article of his charge.
In most cases of theft, murder, malicious mischief and the
like, the crime leaves such vestiges behind it, as upon
the first view betray the felony which has been committed.
The same is not true of fire-raising: On the contrary, the out∣ward
spectacle of a wilful, and of an accidental fire, is quite
the same; and indeed the more complete the success of the
felony, the more thoroughly all the means of detecting it
are destroyed. Excepting, therefore, in those rare cases,
where direct testimony can be obtained to the very act of set∣ting
fire, the prosecutor has to surmount this obstacle, as he
best may, by convincing arguments and presumptions, drawn
from the circumstances of the case. It is an article of that
tendency, that fire breaks out suddenly in a house which is
not inhabited, or in remote parts of a building at the same
time, or that combustibles are found strewed in or about the
premisses. But it were vain to attempt any enumeration of
the particulars which may be serviceable in that respect, or
to think of laying down any rule for their sufficiency, other
than this obvious and general direction, that the proofs and
tokens must be pregnant to prevail against the pannel, who
in this, as in other cases, has the presumption of innocence
in his favour. Barely to say that it is not easy to imagine,
<PB N="180" REF="239"/>
by what other than wilful means the fire could happen, will
not, without some farther indication, be sufficient; so many
are the strange accidents, and trifling indiscretions by which
mischief of this sort may be occasioned. On that ground, in
the case of John Ker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792.</NOTE> the jury found a verdict for the pannel.</P>
<P>SIR GEORGE MACKENZIE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the wilful purpose.</NOTE> in his chapter concerning this
crime<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">No. 2.</NOTE>, seems disposed even to go a greater length, and to
require a proof of the <HI>corpus delicti</HI> by direct testimony, or by
confession of party, to the absolute exclusion of presumption.
But as this passage is introduced with mention of the case
of John Meldrum, tried in August 1633, the meaning may
only be, and in this he is surely right, to exclude those vague
and inconclusive presumptions of common fame, previous
enmity, threats of mischief, and the like, which seem in
that case to have been the chief grounds of conviction.
The charge against Meldrum was for burning the tower of
Frendraught, “of the height (the libel says), of four house
high,” and in which perished the Viscount Melgum, son
of the Marquis of Huntly, the laird of Rothiemay, and four
of their servants, all of them guests at the time with the laird
of Frendraught. Meldrum▪ had once been an inmate of
the house; and the manner of the fire was supposed to be by
his tossing combustibles into a vault at the bottom of the
tower, “through the slits and scores of the vault,” whence
the flame communicated upwards, through a square aper∣ture,
or hole in the arch of the vault, and cousumed the
whole of this high tower. This was, however, nothing bet∣ter
than a hypothesis, unsupported by any pointed proof
with respect to the manner in which the fire began; and
though the man may have been guilty, I must agree with Mac∣kenzie
in thinking it doubtful, whether there was legal evi∣dence
<PB N="181" REF="240"/>
to convict him. A person named John Toshoch, a
servant in the tower, and an alleged accomplice of Mel∣drum's,
was indicted in the succeeding year; but as he had
previously been put to the torture, which he sustained without
confessing, and as no farther evidence had after this time
been obtained against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1634.</NOTE> the Court, in these circumstances,
refused to remit him to an assize.</P>
<P>WHERE these qualities concur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Thing burned, by fire set to another.</NOTE> it will not materially
affect the case, what the mode of executing the mischief
be: Whether it be done by one person or by a mob, (as
was resolved in the case of William Spence);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1784.</NOTE> whether
the pannel kindle the fire with his own hand, or by that
of others whom he procures or equips for the enter∣prise;
or whether he apply the fire directly to the thing or
tenement which is meant to be destroyed, or to something
contained in or nearly connected with it, so that the one
being on fire, the other is likely to kindle. If the pan∣nel,
thinking to cheat the law, shall not cast fire into
the corn, but into the dry furze in the middle of the field,
or immediately bounding it, or if he kindle a stack of
feuel adjoining to the barn-yard, or set fire to the goods
or furniture in the ware-house, he shall still be judged
as a fire-raiser, if his purpose take effect, by fastening
upon or consuming any part of the corn or of the build∣ing;
for it is all one, as if he had laid and kindled a
train of gun-powder with the same intent. The charge was
accordingly found relevant in a case of this description, that
of James Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. &amp; 10. 1682.</NOTE> who having broken into a writer's cham∣ber
and stolen, wilfully placed a burning candle among the
papers in a press or desk, (thinking to conceal his theft);
<PB N="182" REF="241"/>
whereby the house was set fire to and burned<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He escaped conviction, owing to a defect and irregularity in the way of pro∣ving his confession.</NOTE>. Nay, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
little shall he have any defence, though the thing which he
sets fire to be even his own property, if it be so situated
that the safety of his neighbour's property depends on it,
(being, for instance, floors of the same tenement, or being
contiguous and connected buildings), and if any part of his
neighbour's property is in consequence consumed. Certain∣ly,
by how much more such a deed shows a rooted and inve∣terate
malice against his neighbour, by so much more is it
deserving of the highest pains of law.</P>
<P>IN these instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Thing burned by fire set to another.</NOTE> I have supposed the pannel to have had a
purpose from the first, against the very subject which has in the
event been destroyed. But even this may not in every case be
necessary. It is the general rule which governs in the con∣struction
of other offences, and will equally apply here,
that the malefactor who is actuated by a malicious purpose
against his neighbour, and has meant to do him a great and fe∣lonious
mischief, shall be accountable for all the consequences
of his act; at least, if they are not of quite a fortuitous and
extraordinary nature, but such as might naturally, and not
improbably ensue on his enterprise. If, therefore, any one
set fire to his neighbour's copse-wood, or heath, or moss,
with intent only to destroy that subject, (in which he does
not commit a capital offence), but the fire gets head, and
consumes corn and houses, and all that is in the way, he
shall be punished in the same degree, as if he had intended all
this ravage from the first. He showed a high dole, a de∣praved
and wicked purpose against his neighbour, in the im∣mediate
<PB N="183" REF="242"/>
thing he did; that which has followed is a mis∣chief,
though higher, of the very same fort with that which
he intended, and so likely to follow on it, that, when he did
the other, he must have been utterly indifferent to his
neighbour's interest and safety, whether this mischief also
should ensue or not: So that the first purpose in such a
case naturally connects with the event, and completes the
capital offence. I shall put another case in illustration. If
a mob break into a man's house, and pull his effects to
pieces, and afterwards, the more effectually to destroy them,
proceed to pile them up in front of the house, and there
to burn the heap, by which the house itself is set fire to and
consumed; this, without a doubt, is fire-raising, though it
happen beyond their first intent.</P>
<P>AND here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object of the Fire raising not material,</NOTE> though not strictly in the order of our arrange∣ment,
I am naturally led on to observe with respect to the
offender's purpose, that if it was to burn the thing which has
been consumed, the crime will not the less be fire-raising, that
the doing of this particular mischief was not the ultimate, nor
sole, nor even chief purpose of his enterprise. If a mob assault
a gaol, to rescue rioters who are confined there, and they
burn down the doors, passages, and inner strengths of the
gaol, to obtain entry of the building; and of its several parts,
this seems alike to be fire-raising, (and may he maintained
to be so, even though they themselves should in the end extin∣guish
the fire), as if they had no other object in coming there.
It is still true that fire has been wilfully, maliciously, and felo∣niously,
not casually, excusably, or culpably raised within this
gaol, and that part of the same has thereby been consumed;
and the case is only so much the worse for the pannels, if this
act has been subservient to the also unlawful, and felonious
<PB N="184" REF="243"/>
transgressions of mobbing, breaking gaol, and setting pri∣soners
at large. Or put the case, that a toll-house is inva∣ded,
and partly burned by a mob, with the purpose of hin∣dering
the collection of the toll. It cannot be imagined that
the fire-raising ceases to be such, because it is the useful,
or the necessary instrument, towards that farther, and also
criminal object. In the case of Maclauchlane, tried as ac∣cessory
to the outrages committed by the Porteous mob, one
of which was the burning the doors of the gaol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 93.</NOTE> to gain
admittance to their victim, this of fire-raising was according∣ly
libelled, among other denominations of crime. But whe∣ther
the charge was meant to be sustained under that form,
cannot be said upon the general terms in which the interlocu∣tor
is expressed.</P>
<P>IT remains to enquire concerning the things or subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Fire-rai∣sings punishable with Death.</NOTE>
on which the capital crime of fire-raising may be committed.
There can be no question with respect to those subjects, name∣ly,
houses, corn, and coal-heughs, which are specially men∣tioned
in the statutes 1528, 1540, and 1592. And these, for
obvious reasons, are certainly the possessions which most re∣quire
to be guarded from this sort of injury. Neither can
I find that any. judgment has extended the description of
the crime beyond these articles, so as to affix the same pains
to the burning of woods, heaths, mosses, stacks of feuel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, No. 5. says, That in the case of Suddie, the Justices refused to sustain the burning of some feuel in a muir as treason. The fact, as upon the re∣cord, appears to be, that the Advocate din not insist upon his libel to that extent, but, upon objection moved<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consented “That the Justices consider the punish∣ment.” The verdict (of the 4th August), convicted the pannels only in terms of their own confessions, as burning feuel <HI>which belonged to themselves.</HI> Sentence was superseded, till discussion of the point of property and possession of the ground where this feuel was destroyed.</NOTE>,
<PB N="185" REF="244"/>
or in general any sort of moveable effects. Whatever may
be true as to other modes of charge, it would not therefore
be capital as fire-raising, that a mob, after riffling a house,
collect the effects and burn them in the street; nor even
within the house, that they burn the owner's title-deeds,
bank-notes and bonds, or other valuable papers and preci∣ous
effects, gathered into a heap in the fire-place, or upon
the hearth.</P>
<P>WITH respect however to corn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of Corn is capital.</NOTE> this subject, according to
the statutes 1528 and 1540, is equally protected by the
highest pains, whether it be in the field, or gathered into the
corn-yard or barn. And with respect to houses, the broad
terms of the act 1528, “all burnings of houses and corns,”
seem to be applicable alike, and practice has in fact applied
them, to every sort of house, whether it be a dwelling-house,
work-house, or warehouse, or a barn, stable, or other out∣house;
so it be what is commonly termed or understood to
be a house, and not a bare hovel or temporary place of shel∣ter.
Still less is any distinction admitted in the case of
a dwelling-house, according as it is or is not inhabited, or
even fit for habitation at the time. The charge was found
relevant in the following cases; that of Alexander Cun∣ningham,
July 30. 1677, for burning Lord Strathmore's of∣fices
and stables<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This case is worth consulting, as an instance of presumptive probation. An ambiguity in the wording of the verdict prevented sentence of death.</NOTE>; that of William and Alexander Fra∣sers,

and for burning and destroying the said twa bear∣stacks,
and sax ait-stacks, with the said barn, and certain
corns being therein.” He was convicted of this charge,
with the exception of the oat-stacks, and was hanged. The
oldest case I have met with is entered thus: “9th February

<P><PB N="187" REF="246"/>
BUT is it to be held concerning those tenements which
are the subjects of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Tenant burning House let to him.</NOTE> that they are so in all situ∣ations,
and even though a material interest in them is vest∣ed
in the offender himself? If the offender's interest is any
thing less than the property of the tenement; as for in∣stance
if the tenant or liferenter of a house, out of malice
to the owner, burns it over his own head, and perhaps part
of his own effects along with it; the crime seems to be no
farther altered than by the extraordinary malice of the of∣fender,
which will be gratified at any, however costly, rate
to himself, and overlooks all considerations of interest and
prudence. He has still wilfully burned the property of an∣other,
and in doing so, has been actuated by the proper dole
of the crime, in a more than ordinary degree.</P>
<P>IN the opposite case too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Man burning his own House.</NOTE> of a person wilfully burning his
own house, out of malice to a tenant or liferenter who is in
possession of it, these considerations weigh against the pan∣nel;
that he deprives the possessor of his home and dwelling∣place,
and destroys that real interest which he has in the
tenement for the time, as also occasions him all that perso∣nal
alarm, distress and danger, which, as much as the patri∣monial
loss, are considered by the law in this matter, and
are among the principal motives of its severity on the of∣fence.
Accordingly, this was found to be fire-raising in
the case of Walter Buchannan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15. 1728.</NOTE> against whom it was one
article, in a very numerous list of charges, that he had set
fire to the houses of Taynlone, his own property, but life∣rented
by Jean Dougal, (Lady Branshogle) and possessed by
her tenant John Maclintock, who had placed his corn and
effects in them. The pannel pleads, “That it is ad∣mitted
that the house was his own property. Who then
<PB N="188" REF="247"/>
can believe, <HI>that for the sake of damaging a little a liferent∣rix
whose interest might have lasted for a month,</HI> a man would
have destroyed his own property, whereby the far greater
prejudice must have arisen to himself.” The prosecutor
answers, “That the libel bears, that the house was possessed
by the Lady Branshogle and her tenant, as will be proven.
Besides the very discharge founded upon by the pannel
himself, instructs that she was in the possession of Tayn∣lone,
it bearing that the rents of these lands were counted
upon. So that <HI>albeit the property of Taynlone did belong to
the pannel, yet if he or any other heritor should set fire to houses
possest by tenants,</HI> it would unquestionably be wilful fire∣raising;
and therefore this point needs not be further dis∣puted.”
The Lords find upon this debate, “That the
house or houses of Taynlone, <HI>said to be liferented</HI> by Jean
Dougal complainer, were upon one or other of the days
of January 1721, by fire burned down; and that some
time before they were burned down, as said is, Walter Bu∣channan
pannel did <HI>threaten the burning of them,</HI> relevant
to infer an arbitrary punishment. <HI>Separatim</HI> find, That
after John Maclintock had taken possession of the said
house, he the said Walter Buchaunan, did, at the time li∣belled,
<HI>set fire to the said house,</HI> whereby, the same, or the
corns or plenishing placed there by the said John Mac∣lintock
were burnt, relevant to infer the pains of law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The same question was debated in the case of John Ker, 13th January 1792; but the decision was prevented by the consent of the prosecutor to restrict his libel to an arbitrary pain. The question was rendered still nicer in that case by certain additional circumstances; of which in their place.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS case was even thus far favourable to the pan∣nel,
that no person was dwelling in the house, to be
alarmed or put in danger. One circumstance more can
however be imagined, to make the situation still more favour∣able
<PB N="189" REF="248"/>
able to him; which is, that the tenant or liferenter is
not even in possession by having his effects in the house, and
thus suffers no loss but that of his real interest, which is
then only like that of a real creditor or adjudger of a sub∣ject,
which remains in the natural occupation of the owner.
But I am now stating a case which has never yet been
tried.</P>
<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Man burning his own House.</NOTE> and still more unlikely situation is, if a person
shall burn his own house, being either unoccupied at the
time, or occupied by himself. Now, if only his own house
be destroyed, and if this be so situated as not even to be at∣tended
with any risk of damage to the property of others
in the burning of it, and if it be set fire to withall, (if such a
thing could happen), for sport only, and without any sort
of malicious intention, this seems not only not to be the
crime of fire-raising, but not to be any crime at all. If it
is a house in a town, or is so situated that any degree of
danger, or of alarm and disturbance to the vicinity, arises
from the burning of it, the offender shall be liable to punish∣ment,
both in his purse and otherwise, as for a high breach
of good neighbourhood and public police.</P>
<P>A MORE unfavourable case to the offender,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning to de∣fraud Insurers.</NOTE> and of which
it was left to the ingenuity of modern times to introduce us
to the knowledge, is, if he insure his house at a high rate,
and afterwards set fire to it, with intent to injure the under∣writers.
Whether this enterprise succeed or not, by recove∣ry
of the money from the underwriters, and though only the
pannel's own house be destroyed; of this there cannot
be any doubt that the attempt is a criminal fraud of
the worst kind, and punishable with the highest arbitra∣ry
<PB N="190" REF="249"/>
pains. It was found relevant to that effect upon the Lord
Advocate's restriction of his libel, in the case of John Ker.
And in the prior case of Thomas Muir and James Cant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792.</NOTE>
which is our first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. 1774.</NOTE> and only other case of that sort, the
pannels, after some debate upon the question, and in pur∣suance
of their own petition, were adjudged to be tran∣sported.</P>
<P>BUT in this way the two main controversies still con∣tinue
undecided: First, and which is attended with the
greater difficulty, whether such fraudulent burning of a
person's own house be a capital fire-raising: And secondly,
which may seem more probable, whether when a person,
thus fraudulently settting fire to his own house, happens also
to burn his neighbour's house, or part of it, this is a capital
fire-raising, by reason of the highly criminal and kindred
nature of the original intent. The decision of a third and
still nicer question was prevented by the restriction of the
libel in the said case of Ker. For the charge against him
was, that having insured a tenement of houses, his pro∣perty,
and partly occupied by himself, partly by tenants,
he, in order to defraud the insurers, had set fire to the part
possessed by himself; whereby the whole building, being
all under one roof, and part of his tenants effects along
with it, were consumed. Thus the case involved the triple
question, of burning his own house in the occupation of a
tenant; of burning it by connection only with another pos∣sessed
by himself; and of setting fire to that one with intent
only to defraud. With respect to property in ships, the
doubt has been removed by the late statute, 29th Geo. III.
c. 46. which makes it a capital offence to burn, or otherwise
wilfully to destroy, any insured vessel, with intent to preju∣dice
the underwriters, or others concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="250"/>
THE convictions of fire-raising are not very numerous,
and are mostly of an ancient date.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Fire-raising</NOTE> On the 13th May 1609,
Sir James Macconnell, for burning the house of Askomell, and
breaking the King's ward in the castle of Edinburgh, had sen∣tence
of death and forfeiture. On the 14th June 1615, John
Henry, for setting fire to the coal-heugh of Little Fawside,
was sentenced to be beheaded, and his head to be set up
upon a pole at the heugh.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 18. &amp; 19. 1631.</NOTE> As also, Andrew Stewart, Alas∣ter
Stewart, and others, for burning the standing corn, barns
and houses on the lands of Ballindalloch, were sentenced
to be hanged, and their heads to be struck off and placed up∣on
the West Port of Edinburgh. Fire-raising, indeed, is one
charge, among others, which commonly occurred in the libels
against Highland robbers and depredators; as in that against
Alaster More Macgregor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 7. 1668.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who, for burning the house
of Belchirie, belonging to Lyon of Muiresk, was doomed
to die, to have the right hand struck off, and to be hung in
chains.</P>
<P>III. So much shall suffice for the proper and capital crime
of fire-raising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inferior acts of Fire-raising.</NOTE> which is only committed upon property of
certain sorts. But our view of this part of the law will still
be incomplete, unless the following things shall be attended to.</P>
<P>1. To destroy in this way any of the other sorts of proper∣ty,
moveable or immoveable, is always a heinous crime, and
punishable on every occasion, at common law, with the
highest arbitrary pains.</P>
<P>2. IN this instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to raise fire is punish∣able.</NOTE> as in some others, where the crime
is attended with high danger and alarm, and indicates the
extreme depravity of the offender, even the unsuccessful at∣tempt
<PB N="192" REF="251"/>
to commit it, <HI>“si devenit ad actum proximum,”</HI> is ac∣counted
a point of dittay, and for the sake of example, as
well as in order to amend the offender, or at least to deter him
from any renewal of his wickedness, may be repressed by a
suitable and severe correction. Interlocutor was given to
that purpose in the said case of Walter Buchannan, upon the
charge of casting a kindled peat into a house, with intent to
burn the tenement<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, That at the time libelled, in the year 1723, when the said houses were in the possession of John Montgomery, he the said pannel having attempted by himself, or others of his outhounding, to kindle a fire to the said houses, <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. BUT even a greater latitude than this has been taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Threats to raise fire are punish∣able.</NOTE>
and relevancy been sustained upon more remote acts of pre∣paration
for the crime, nay, upon the bare threatening to
commit it. The very uttering of such threats is itself con∣sidered
as an outrage and injury, by reason of the alarm
and loss of peace which may attend such denunciations,
when violent or frequently repeated.</P>
<P>A CHARGE of this sort was sent to the assize, in the case of
Grizzel Sommerville<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And sustain the reiterated threats of offering to burn the house, and to kill, as mentioned in the libel, relevant to infer an arbitrary pain.”</NOTE>, and in that of the Laird and Lady<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1686.</NOTE>
Grant<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the said Ludovick Grant, his threatening to burn the house of Castlegrant, <HI>or</HI> the charter-chest or writs therein, or the breaking the door and iron bars of the charter-house, where the said charter-chest and writs were, since the disposition by him to his son, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment.”</NOTE>, in neither of which any actual damage had been done;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 7. 1712.</NOTE>
<PB N="193" REF="252"/>
as also in the case, already quoted, of Walter Buchannan<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“They find, That the house or houses of Taynlone, said to be liferented by Jean Dougal complainer, were upon one or other of the days of January 1721, by fire burned down; and that some time before they were burned down, as said is, Walter Buchannan pannel, did threaten the burning of them, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>,
where a burning ensued. And again, in the case of Patrick
Hepburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. &amp; 12. 1714.</NOTE> where also a fire had followed soon after the
threats, the Court decerned the pannel to find caution as in
law-borrows, but under an extraordinary penalty, (for to such
a case of <HI>proof and conviction</HI> of malice, the statutory limita∣tion
of the surety will not apply), “in respect that two of
the threatenings sustained in the interlocutor against the
pannel, are found proved.”</P>
<P>SUCH being our practice as to threats, much more will we
be jealous of all approaches towards the perpetration of the
act, by soliciting or exciting others to commit it, even though
they refuse to be concerned; for if they comply, and fire is
raised in consequence, and the instigation can be shown to
have been the motive of the actors, then the author of the
counsel is art and part of the capital offence. The insti∣gation
is therefore laid as a separate offence in the libel
against William and Alexander Fraser;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 4. 7. 8. and 14. 1720.</NOTE> and it is, <HI>separatim,</HI>
found relevant to infer an arbitrary pain, “the said pannels,
or either of them, their having invited or solicited others
to have set fire to the said barn, or corns in the barn-yard.”
These subjects had actually been destroyed, but not by the
<PB N="194" REF="253"/>
persons solicited, who are stated in the libel to have refused.
Upon verdict convicting in terms of this part only<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“But find the third part, from which the Lords infer an arbitrary punish∣ment, proven against both pannels.” 8th November 1720.</NOTE> of the
interlocutor, both pannels were banished to the plantations
for life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF FALSEHOOD AND FRAUD.</HEAD>
<P>IN this chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALSEHOOD.</NOTE> we are to have before us a great variety
of transgressions, all of which are, however, naturally
reducible to the one head of FALSEHOOD, or <HI>crimen falsi;</HI> a
point of criminal accusation thoroughly established in the
Roman law, whence, at a remote period, it had been trans∣lated
into that of Scotland. Among the different species
of this comprehensive class, let us first attend to that sort
of falsehood, the most frequent and the most dangerous of
any, which is committed by the falsification of writings,
and which in the style of modern practice, (for it was not
so anciently), has been distinguished by the appellation of
Forgery.</P>
<P>I. IN discoursing of forgery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Forgery.</NOTE> it will be convenient to in∣vert
our usual order, and to turn our attention in the first
place to the pains, instead of the description of the offence;
because, without frequent reference to the former, the several
stages and degrees in the falsification of writings can scarce∣ly
to any advantage be explained.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="255"/>
AND, first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V.</NOTE> I shall take up our numerous statutes concern∣ing
falsehood, which, if clear and decisive, would relieve
from the trouble of any farther investigation. But on look∣ing
into these, of which the following are the chief, 1503,
c. 64.; 1540, c. 80.; 1551, c. 22.; 1621, c. 22.; it will be
found difficult to discover any certain warrant in them for
inflicting that ultimate punishment, which is, however, well
known to be the ordinary consequence of the higher spe∣cies
of falsehood. As far as any of these laws are spe∣cial,
they rather afford an argument the other way; in
as much as they enumerate only inferior pains, such as ba∣nishment,
and dismembering of hand or tongue, and, in
their more general expressions, consist only of a reference to
the pains of the canon and civil laws. Now, the inflicting
of death was not, in any instance, within the province of
the spiritual courts. Neither does it appear, that in the ci∣vil
law, the falsification of writings, nor indeed any other
sort of falsehood, was punished with this severity, except in
a slave, or in the case of false coining, which fell under the
<HI>Lex Julia Majestatis,</HI> or in the case of him, who, as a witness,
or as a magistrate, had been the cause of the death of an in∣nocent
person, and might therefore, as a murderer, be judg∣ed
on the <HI>Lex Cornelia de sicariis.</HI> The stated and ordinary
pain of falsehood in a freeman, was deportation, and consis∣cation
of goods<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. lib. 48. tit. 10. l. 1. No. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.; Ibid. tit. 8. l. 1. No. 1; Cod. 9. tit. 24. l. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING is, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Forgery.</NOTE> proved by a longer train of cohe∣rent
and authentic evidence, than that, according to the
course of custom in this matter, to which those statutes refer,
<PB N="197" REF="256"/>
and by which, as far as they are doubtful, they have been
explained, our Judges possess a discretionary power of pu∣nishing
this sort of falsehood <HI>pro modo admissi,</HI> and of applying
the highest pains to it in those cases, where either the wic∣kedness,
or the danger of the act, requires the example of
such severity. As this, on some occasions, has been a point
of controversy, I will briefly submit to consideration some
of the most remarkable of the judgments to that purpose.</P>
<P>THE oldest instance that I have met with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Forgery.</NOTE> is that of
Sir John Crawford, notary, who had sentence of death on the
16th July 1573, for the stealing of a certain writ from Mary
Millar, and forging an instrument to the prejudice of the
same person<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I find before this, various examples of arbitrary pain; of which it was ordina∣rily a part, that the hand was struck off, as ordered by the statute of Alexander II. c. 19. David Sechye, notary, for forging an assignation, was banished, declared inf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mous, and had his right hand struck off; 5th May 1558. Andrew Drum∣mond, for forging a charter, had the like sentence; 18th May 1556. As had Thomas Barry, 6th November 1570, for forging the subscription of the Earl of Lennox, regent, to diverse letters and grants. MS. abst, in Adv. Library.</NOTE> James Merchieston had the like sentence,
on the 11th December 1579, for the inventing and feign∣ing
of a pretended obligation of the laird of Carnbee. Soon
after came the case of Adam Ramsay and Alexander Adam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 15. 1580.</NOTE>
who were both hanged “for the falsifying, feigning and
inventing of ane false instrument of seisin of ane tene∣ment
of land lying in the burgh of Perth.” The next
to this is the case of John Halliday burgess of Edinburgh,
Thomas Marjoribanks notary, James Lowrie, John Winzet
baker to his Majesty, and Alexander Lowrie baxter in Edin∣burgh,
who, on the 8th February 1597, had all of them sen∣tence
of death, for their several concerns in certain for∣geries.
<PB N="198" REF="257"/>
On the same day, John Moscrop had the like sen∣tence
on a separate charge. Another striking example fol∣lowed
a few years after; when Finlay Ferne, James Tarbat
writer in Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. &amp; 16. 1600.</NOTE> and Robert Innes notary, were also con∣demned
to die for their several parts in one false transaction.
Indeed, it appears that about this period the thing had been
in flagrant practice; in so much that his Majesty, in a let∣ter
to the Advocate, which is entered in the books of ad∣journal,
commands that officer diligently to enquire after
and pursue all offenders in this kind.</P>
<P>EVEN these examples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of <HI>Forgery.</HI></NOTE> severe as they were, had not how∣ever
been attended with the immediate effect of repressing
the evil. The following persons were all condemned to
die, for false writings of different kinds, in the course of
the next twenty years. William Norval, schoolmaster of
Cockpen, June 9. 1602; David Donaldson, December 12.
1611; Alexander Cook, Sheriff-clerk of Berwickshire, De∣cember
20. 1616; John Muirhead, notary in Tweedmouth,
Nov. 17, 18. 1617; Dempster of Muiresk, April 20. 1620;
and John Watson, July 11. and 16. 1623.</P>
<P>THE next trial that came to a capital issue, is that of
William Blair notary, and Thomas Lawson, messenger, in
1650; and it deserves particular attention. On the 26th
and 28th of February, these persons were convicted, Blair of
forging, and Lawson of using a discharge of a bond of L. 20
Scots; Blair was farther convicted of forging a bond for
L. 320.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. <HI>ult.</HI> 1650.</NOTE> On Lawson, the Court, by direction of the Privy Coun∣cil,
pronounced sentence of pillory, infamy, and banishment.
With respect to Blair, the Justice-depute offered a supplica∣tion
to Parliament, setting forth his conviction, and pray∣ing
advice concerning the lawful and proper sentence to
<PB N="199" REF="258"/>
be passed on him. Instead of deciding on it directly them∣selves,
Parliament remitted this memorial, for more mature
consideration, to a committee of their number, the most qua∣lified
to judge of such matters, whose report was thus:
“That haveing considderit the within supplicatione remittit
to thaim,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6. 1650.</NOTE> togidder with the instructiones thereof, and actis
of Parliament and criminal praticques puniching the com∣mittirs
of falsett with death, doe find the within men∣tionat
William Blair to deserve the punichment of death
for several actis of falsett, and forgerie of fals writs,
mentionat in the within supplicatione, and at length con∣teinat
in ane decreet of the Lords of Counsall and Ses∣sione.”
On the 7th of June, the Estates of Parliament
approved of this report, and ordained the Justice to pro∣ceed
to minister justice on the convict. In pursuance of
which direction, Blair had sentence of death upon the 8th.
Here then is an express and solemn judgment of Parliament,
given upon review of the whole matter, statutes and course
of practice, and for the very purpose of sixing the point in
all future time.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, the question was again stirred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the pains of Forgery Feb. 11. and Mar. 12. 1663.</NOTE> upon the
words of the statutes, in the case of Alexander Kennedy,
where the libel concluded “for the pains due to the com∣mitters
of falsehood, whilk by the constant practicque of
this kingdom is the pains and tinsel of life and moveable
estate.” The Justice sustained the libel as laid; and
Kennedy being convicted, was adjudged to die.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 12. 1677.</NOTE> In like
manner, the libel against William and John Rutherford, en∣grosses
the act 1621, c. 22. and sets forth in connection with
it, “That by the municipal law and practicque of this
kingdom, the pain of death, and the escheat and consis∣cation
<PB N="200" REF="259"/>
of moveables, are the pains due to the committers
of falsehood.” These persons also were convicted, and
suffered death. There followed in the same century, the con∣viction
and execution of Dr John Elliot; in January 1694.</P>
<P>NOTICE may farther be taken of these capital convictions,
of a later date. The case of Mungo Strachan and William
Hunter, February 2. and 3. 1708; of Margaret Nisbet, Feb∣ruary
1. and 3. 1727; and of George Mackerracher, Februa∣ry
19. and 21. 1788; in both of which last cases, judgment
was given after debate on the point. Nor are these to be
passed over, in which a capital relevancy was found, though
conviction did not follow: November 19. 1705, John Howie∣son;
and Andrew Adam, February 20. 1710.</P>
<P>THESE, too, are exclusive of the many capital judgments,
in later times, for the forgery of bank-notes, which have
all proceeded on the ground of common law, without aid
of any statute in that behalf. The following persons
have had sentence of death for that offence: Robert Fle∣ming,
February 12. and 19. 1711; John Campbell, March
and April 1731; John Young, November 14. 1750; John
Raybould, January 18. and 19. 1768; William Herries, April
24. 1770; David Reid, August 12. 1780; John Macaffee,
November 1782.</P>
<P>THERE is thus scarce any point of our criminal practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the pains of Forgery.</NOTE>
which rests upon a longer train of precedents, than this of
capital pain applied to the crime of forgery. But although,
speaking in the general, the competency of this course of
judgment will not admit a doubt, it is not, however, meant
to be affirmed, that the Court have therefore an unlimited
discretion in this matter, so as to punish capitally in every
instance of false writing whatsoever. On the contrary, in
<PB N="201" REF="260"/>
terms of their own custom and course of practice, by which
chiefly the statutes have been expounded, so as at all to permit
the pronouncing of such a sentence, this power stands limi∣ted
to certain the more audacious and dangerous modes of
falsification of writing, and could not now be warrantably ex∣tended
to other modes, which have not hitherto been thought
deserving of the highest vengeance of the law. What those
modes are, we shall now proceed to enquire, and to ascer∣tain
at the same time the material characters of this offence,
as well in general, as in those its more criminal kinds.</P>
<P>II. THE most undoubted mode of capital falsification of
writing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Writings de∣fined.</NOTE> is the felonious making and publishing of a writing,
to the prejudice of another, as the <HI>signed instrument</HI> of a per∣son,
who in truth has not subscribed it. Some have even
thought that it is only to this mode of falsehood that the
term of forgery properly applies; and certainly on account
of the facility, the danger, and the flagrant impudence of
such an attempt, in which one man presumptuously assumes
the person, and acts in the name of another, it is the object
of the peculiar aversion and jealousy of the law.</P>
<P>1. To ensure the success of such an enterprise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imitation of Hand, how far necessary.</NOTE> the of∣fender
commonly proceeds by imitation of the hand-wri∣ting
of the person, to whom the deed is ascribed; so
that it may pass unsuspected by favour of that resemblance
and deception. And where this course has been taken, it
will, without a doubt, be no objection to the charge, nor to
its relevancy for the highest pains of law, that the pannel
is deficient in skill, or in attention, and has executed the imi∣tation
in so blundering and aukward a manner, as almost
to insure his detection; mispelling the name perhaps, or
<PB N="202" REF="261"/>
omitting part of the subscription. A blunder of this kind hap∣pened
in the case of Margaret Nisbet in 1727; who, in forging
a bill on the Duchess of Gordon, who was not a Peeress in
her own right, had omitted the Christian name. Such
mistakes, like the want of the water-mark on the paper
of a forged bank-note<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Twelve Judges of England found that this was no objection in the case of James Elliot, 21st July 1777. Leach's Cases, No. 87.</NOTE>, do not alter the dole or depravity,
but only the prudence of the purpose; which is quite a se∣parate
consideration.</P>
<P>2. BUT although this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be forgery without imita∣tion of Hand.</NOTE> of counterfeiting a man's hand, be
an ordinary, it does not however seem to be a necessary cir∣cumstance
of the capital offence. For there are several situa∣tions,
in which, without employing that expedient, the of∣fender
equally gives out and publishes a writing as the deed
and signed instrument of a person who knows nothing of
it; and in which he not only accomplishes the same end,
but does so, substantially, through the very same mode of im∣position,
and one which proceeds from an equal depravity
of purpose. Thus, if money be obtained by the false ac∣ceptance
of a bill, in name of one to whom it is specially
addressed by name and description, and who is a person of
known credit; this seems to be not the less a forgery, and a ca∣pital
crime, that this person never could sign his name at all<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A charge of forgery was made upon an allegation of this sort, <HI>inter alia,</HI> against John Robertson, of the 9th December 1709. The Lords, on the whole circumstances of that case, found the libel not relevant. But no objection was moved on the ground of two of the receipts being forged in name of persons who could not write.</NOTE>.
It is still true, that the offender has made a false deed for
him, and in his name, and that he has done so, not by any
<PB N="203" REF="262"/>
sort of alteration, corruption, or other evil practice upon a
writing which that person had signed, (for any of these is
a different <HI>mode</HI> of imposition), but by the bold device of
assuming his person, signing his name for him, and produ∣cing
and passing <HI>as his genuine signed writing,</HI> that to which
he never set his hand. That in these circumstances the
falsehood was more likely to be detected, (for the objection
comes to no more than this), is quite an extraneous con∣sideration,
and nowise alters the substance, nor lessens the
guilt of that which is done. Farther, as the complete crime
does not in any instance depend on the success of the device
in the obtaining of money; so it will still be forgery,
though this bill, as may probably happen, should be stop∣ped
on the very first attempt to use it.</P>
<P>NEITHER does there seem to be much distinction between
such a case and this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Forge∣ry without Imi∣tation of Hand.</NOTE> that one who has got possession of a
bill, which stands indorsed to another person of the same
name and surname, but who is of better credit, and is fully
described in the indorsement, transfers and indorses this bill
to some third person, who pays him the value, believing him
to be the person described in the preceding indorsement. For,
though he sign his own name and surname, and do not coun∣terfeit
the hand of the true creditor; still he signs for, and
assumes the person of that man, and in his name utters the
bill, which is taken upon the credit of that name, and may
be farther circulated by means of it, to such as are not ac∣quainted
with the hand.</P>
<P>IT would be quite a different case, if one who has found
a bill blank-indorsed, should, on getting payment of it,
grant receipt or indorsement under a pure <HI>fictitious</HI> name.
For in such a case, not only does the offender not presume.
<PB N="204" REF="263"/>
to sign for another existing person; but the credit is here
given to the offender himself <HI>personally,</HI> as an individual,
without any regard to the name which he assumes, or any
reliance on the character, sufficiency, or description of any
other man. Though signed with a fictitious name, the in∣strument
is yet taken and received as the instrument and
security of him, the very person who tenders it, and no
other. Though criminal, this act is therefore not a proper
forgery. There is a situation, different from either of these,
and which holds a middle place between them. This is
where the forgery is of the name of a person who never
existed, but to whom at the same time a certain <HI>character
and description</HI> is attributed, such as is a natural means of
obtaining credit, and may have the effect of procuring mo∣ney.
A charge of this sort, along with others, appears in
the libel against William Hunter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. 3. &amp; 5. 1708.</NOTE> and is to this purpose.
Hunter had obtained confirmation of Margaret Guine,
<HI>spouse of John Hodge, as executor to her deceased brother</HI> Robert
Guine, who was creditor, by certificate, to the African
Company. In truth, there was no such person as Margaret
Guine: John Hodge was not alive but dead, and the name
of his relict was not Margaret Guine, but Agnes Crawford.
Hunter proceeded to forge an indorsement, in his own fa∣vour,
of the said certificate, in name of John Hodge and
Margaret Guine; and this he presented for payment, but,
as far as appears, without success. This entire charge was
found relevant, and the pannel, having confessed, was con∣demned
to die. But the question was not debated; and as
the forgery of Margaret Guine's name was combined with
that of the name of John Hodge, a real person, and likewise
with a separate and capital charge, (of which afterwards),
the case cannot perhaps be cited as a precedent.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="264"/>
THIS point of doctrine may be farther illustrated thus,
There are two ways in which the law of Scotland allows a
person to subscribe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Deeds signed by Notaries.</NOTE> by his own hand if he is capable, and
otherwise by the hand of notaries, to whom he gives man∣date,
and in presence of witnesses, who sign along with the
notaries. Now, if it should happen, (though, fortunately,
such a combination is far from likely), that the due num∣ber
of persons conspire to frame a false deed of this last
sort, for a person who cannot write, they have it in their
power to accomplish their purpose without any imitation of
hands, and, in one sense, without even any false subscription;
by signing, each of them his own name, in their respective
capacities of notary and witness, but <HI>falsely</HI> relating and
affirming a mandate so to do. Now, substantially, this is
the very same thing, and as much or even more worthy of
a capital pain, as when John signs the name, and counter∣feits
the hand of James. In truth, these notaries <HI>do</HI> sign the
name of another man; that is, in the way, wherein law allows
persons in his condition to sign: and whether the appear∣ance
of a genuine and authentic deed is given to a false one
in the one way of subscription or the other, there seems to be
no reason for distinguishing; since the substance,—the wic∣kedness,
and the effect of what is done, is the same in both
situations. This is not a fictitious case; for sentence of
death passed on Mungo Strachan notary<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Strachan was not concerned in the other acts above mentioned, charged against Hunter, and which were laid in a separate libel of the same date. So that he had sentence on the single ground of his falsehood as notary.</NOTE>, and William Hun∣ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. 3. 5. 1708.</NOTE>
for the execution, in that way, of two false deeds of fac∣tory,
in name of persons deceased.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="265"/>
OF a nature nearly allied to this, and depending on the
same notion of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery by false Mandate to No∣taries.</NOTE> is the no less improbable, but
also real and adjudged case, of one man personating an∣other
who cannot write, and thus imposing upon notaries,
to whom he gives mandate to sign for him whom he
personates, and who is to them unknown. This is the
description of the case of David Donaldson.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 12. 1611.</NOTE> Who, having
got into the confidence of one Alexander, an old, bed∣rid,
and facile person, and blind of one eye, and having
made use of this situation to purloin the man's effects,
and among other things two bonds for money, fell upon
this device, for enabling him to recover the contents. He
employs a notary, as if by Alexander's desire, to draw an
assignation in favour of him, Donaldson, of all Alexander's
effects, and in particular of these bonds. Which being done,
he carries this notary and another, along with sundry honest
witnesses, but all of them strangers to Alexander, to a
house in Leith, where they are shown Alexander, (as they be∣lieve),
lying ill in bed, and with a patch on his eye and cheek.
After hearing the assignation read, this person gives man∣date
to the notaries to subscribe it for him; which is ac∣cordingly
done. In truth, this person was not Alexander,
but one John Henry, a cobler, and an associate of Donald∣son's,
whom he had seduced to join in the plot. The instru∣ment
being thus obtained, without any manner of wrong on
the part of any one whose hand appeared at it, and Donald∣son,
out of impatience to reap the fruit of his villany, pro∣ceeding
to do diligence upon the bonds in Alexander's life∣time;
the truth comes to light, and he is tried and convicted,
and has sentence of death.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="266"/>
EXTRAORDINARY as this case is, it is not, however, single
of its kind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery by false Mandate to No∣taries.</NOTE> John Watson in Barnhill, had in like manner
sentence of death; having fraudulently inserted the name of
John Coutts in a bond as cautioner for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 11. &amp; 16. 1623.</NOTE> “and thereaf∣ter,
deceitfully bringing another man to John Craig, notar,
and making him to name himself John Coutts, and so gave
command to the notar to subscribe.” Now, the device
employed in these instances, in this leading character en∣tirely
agrees with the more common one of the imitation of
hand-writing, that it is the false assumption of the person
of another <HI>in the act of signing a deed;</HI> and whether this be
done by the forger's taking the pen into his own hand, or
by his authorising, under a fictitious person, the pen of ano∣ther,
according to the form by law allowed, seems to be
immaterial to the guilt of the case; if it be not that the
latter is the bolder, more deliberate, and more complicated
artifice of the two.</P>
<P>3. ACCORDING to the principle which has ruled in these
cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Sig∣nature by Mark or Initials.</NOTE> a question may seem to arise, whether a capital forge∣ry
may not even be committed by subscriptions of so irregu∣lar
a kind, as scarcely admit forgery in the way of imita∣tion
of hand, but to which, in some instances, the civil
court have however paid regard in patrimonial questions.
As if one man shall assume the person of another, and in his
name draw money which he has right to, and shall put
his mark to a receipt or promissory note for the sum, and
authorise the payer, in his presence, to write his assumed
name and designation, in the usual manner, round the mark.
Or if he shall present a bill, bearing acceptance, by mark
or initials, of one who is in good credit, and shall bring an
associate along with him, who personates this acceptor, and
<PB N="208" REF="267"/>
confesses the subscription, such as it is; and shall thus draw
money on the bill, under the credit of this false acceptance.
No case of this character has yet been tried in our Courts.
And though in the English it has more than once been de∣cided
that such a device is forgery, and falls under their
statutes in that behalf<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the opinion of nine of the Twelve Judges, on the case of Elizabeth Dunn, in September 1765, who had personated a sailor's widow and executrix, and on the credit of that character, had got an advance of money, for which she gave a note in the same character and signed with her mark. Another judg∣ment to the same effect was in the case of Fitzgerald and Lee, who forged a sea∣man's will, signed with his mark, and thereupon obtained a probate, and a ticket for payment for certain arrears of wages. Leach's Cases, No. 31. No. 9.</NOTE>; yet this may not afford a certain in∣ference
with respect to our law: Both because something may
depend on the binding power of such instruments in civil
matters, according to the practice of the two countries, and
because the frequent instances of fraudulent device, which
occur in the more lucrative and corrupted market of that
kingdom, have led to a broader construction of the crime of
forgery, in general, in their Courts, than ours have yet been
accustomed to.</P>
<P>THESE cases also are difficult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Deed above a genuine Subscription.</NOTE> and may be the subject of
different opinions. The case of a genuine subscription torn
from one deed, and pasted or affixed to another, in such a
manner as not easily to be discovered. And the case of a
bill or promissory-note, drawn above a genuine subscription,
but which stood at such a distance from the original wri∣ting
to which it had been affixed, as to allow this fraudulent
operation. In one sense, the subscription may be said to be
genuine; yet it is no less true, that the act of signing, as
relative to this bill or note,—the application of the person's
<PB N="209" REF="268"/>
name to this particular use, is the pure act and fiction of the
offender. Accordingly, if ancient practice is to be followed,
this also shall be judged to be a forgery; for we have a
strong precedent of capital pain applied to a charge of
this description. I allude to the case already mentioned,
of Halliday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1787.</NOTE> Lowrie, and others, against whom the <HI>first</HI>
and principal charge was thus: That having got a blank
paper from Captain William Nesbit, signed with his name,
and intended to be filled up with a decree-arbitral, they
falsely filled up the paper with the discharge of a bond of
1200 merks, due to Nesbit by Lowrie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The case is printed at large in the Appendix.</NOTE>. No doubt seems to
have been entertained that this was a capital charge<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">It appears from the libel and debate, in the case of Robert Binning, July 2. and 3. 1662, that he had before undergone some arbitrary punishment, for writing a false charge to set himself at liberty when in prison, and attempting to authenti∣cate it (which was a high contempt), by the Signet, conclusion, and subscription, which he had torn from an old letter to the Signet. But the circumstances of that prior trial (if there was one), do not appear in the record.</NOTE></P>
<P>I HAVE not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of Wit∣nesses forged to a true Deed.</NOTE> however, found any precedent which deter∣mines
this other, and important question, Whether a capi∣tal
forgery is alike committed by counterfeiting the hand
of witnesses to a true instrument, as the hand itself of the
alleged granter of the deed. Certainly in either case a sub∣scription
is counterfeited, in order to authenticate a deed,
and an instrument is thus rendered <HI>ex facie</HI> valid, and such
as cannot without a proof of forgery be taken away, in∣stead
of being, (as otherwise it would be), <HI>ex facie</HI> null, and
liable to an absolute exception in law; so that the opera∣tion
is to the material prejudice of the person subscribing.
<PB N="210" REF="269"/>
The difficulty is, that the instrument is not false in the fun∣damental
matter, the subscription of the party who is meant
to be taken bound, but only in the form and manner of
that subscription, which are but a quality of the deed. Yet
it is such a quality, that our law holds the writing, in all mat∣ters
of importance, to be the same as none without it; and
as subscriptions are counterfeited in order to avoid an ob∣jection
which would otherwise be as fatal to the deed as the
want even of the granter's name, so it may be plausibly ar∣gued,
that such a charge ought to be sustained. But on this
head I will not presume to offer my private opinion.</P>
<P>THE guilt of the case rises higher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of Wit∣nesses forged to a deed false <HI>in gremio.</HI></NOTE> if beside the false sub∣scription
of witnesses, there is falsehood committed in the
deed itself. As if a bankrupt, wishing to favour one of
his creditors, conveys certain lands to him in security of
his debt, and antedates the deed, to elude the law against
such preferences, and being unable to find trusty witnesses
for his purpose, forges the names of persons in that capa∣city.
This was the nature of the <HI>second</HI> charge against
James and Alexander Lowrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1597.</NOTE> and John Winzet, who, for
some undue purpose, antedated sundry assignations, and for∣ged
the names of three witnesses to support them. It has
been mentioned that these pannels had sentence of death;
but not upon conviction of this single charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel is printed in the Appendix.</NOTE>. A still
stronger case, and which without a doubt is capital, is, if a
notary draw an instrument relating seisin which he ne∣ver
gave, and forge the names of witnesses to lend it faith.
For not only the names of these witnesses are false, but also
the whole instrument is a fiction; and in its own nature such
<PB N="211" REF="270"/>
an instrument is as much the deed and attestation of the
witnesses, and is as much published in their names, as in that
of the notary himself.</P>
<P>4. LET us next enquire concerning the sort of writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of what Writings Forgery capital.</NOTE>
of which a capital falsehood may be committed in this way,
what they must be in respect of form, and what in respect
of tenor and substance.</P>
<P>THE form will not detain us long. For in this matter
our practice does not distinguish, but holds the forgery
to be a capital offence, whether the writing be in the
form of a solemn and regularly attested deed, in which the
hands of party, writer, and witnesses, arc all counterfeited,
or in that of a holograph writing, or though it be even a
naked and unvouched subscription, such as the acceptance
or indorsement of a bill of exchange. Indeed, I do not
observe that this has ever been disputed, excepting in
the one case of Raybould, tried for the forgery of bank∣notes,
where it was objected, that the capital crime could
not be committed by the counterfeiting of unauthentica∣ted
subscriptions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. &amp; 19. 1768.</NOTE> such as the names of the officers of the
bank. This plea was over-ruled.</P>
<P>NEITHER have I found any thing in the record,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Writ be otherwise good in Law.</NOTE> to coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tenance
the opinion, which in itself seems not to be sound,
that the false writing must be drawn in such a shape, as
would render it, if true, a binding and unexceptionable
voucher in law. If, beside the falsehood, it labour under de∣fects
in matter of form, or of regular execution, which
might furnish an attentive or skilful observer with an ex∣ception
to it, this does not take away the falsehood, does
not alter the scope, nor lessen the wickedness of the offen∣der's
<PB N="212" REF="271"/>
purpose; nay, may not hinder it to be successful, and
indeed does not more affect the chance of success, than the
dissimilitude of the hands, or a blunder in the style of the
deed, which, while they expose the fraud to detection, are
however no obstacle to the inflicting of the ordinary pains.
In general it is not the rule of law with respect to any crime,
(for it would be a great encouragement to offenders), to de∣ny
that it has been committed, because by a higher degree of
circumspection on the part of the injured person it might
have been prevented; if he has done nothing to facilitate
or tempt to the commission of it. The offender shall there∣fore
answer it, as for a forgery, though he have used or∣dinary
instead of stamped paper<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the opinion of the Twelve Judges of England upon the case of Hawkeswood, in Easter Term 1783, and in that of John Lee, January 1784, both of them cases of bill forged upon unstamped paper. Leach's Cases, No. 119.</NOTE>, or one sort of stamped
paper instead of another; or though in forging a solemn
deed he have omitted to design the writer, or have given
the witness one name in the testing clause, and another in
the subscription; or, which is only a higher blunder of the
same class, though he adhibit a naked subscription of party,
without witnesses, to a deed of that importance, which
would not be binding by even a genuine subscription of this
unceremonious fashion. How defective soever the writing
in all these instances, the contriver still made it as good as
he could; published it as genuine, and purposed to deceive by
means of it; though his knowledge of the forms of law has
not enabled him to execute it to the best advantage: as
neither might the party concerned have had sufficient skill
in these, to defend himself from the attempt, or discover
the objection. I do not find that any pannel has ever resort∣ed
to such a plea.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="272"/>
TOUCHING the subject also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of what Writs Forgery is ca∣pital.</NOTE> and tenor of the false deed,
little distinction seems to be observed. At common law, for∣gery
may be committed, either of a private writing, or of one
of a public and official nature, such as an extract, a notorial
instrument, or any certificate pertaining to matters of reve∣nue,
which the officers of that department, in the course of
their duty, or in compliance with a statute, have to grant.
Among private writings, it is not confined to those, which,
like bills, bonds, or bank-notes, are calculated for patrimo∣nial
profit, but equally takes in all such as tend to any pur∣pose
of personal security, or revenge, or other gratification or
advantage, in itself of a grave and serious nature, and by the
pannel deemed material enough to be compassed in this way.</P>
<P>I PASS over, for the present, such proofs of this rule as
are in the ordinary course of practice, and confine myself to
the following examples.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1597.</NOTE> John Halliday had sentence of

<P><PB N="215" REF="274"/>
THIS 'also is to be remembered, with respect to the forg∣ing
of bills, bonds, and other documents for money, that
the small amount of the sum, though it will sometimes serve
as a plea to mitigation of the pain, does not affect the style,
nor in strictness, the capital conclusions of the charge. It
was on this ground, that George Short was refused the pri∣vilege
of bail, (18th Nov. 20th Dec. 1765), whose commit∣ment
was on the charge of forging a bill for the sum of L. 2,
5s.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, That the crime for which the petitioner is imprisoned is not bailable.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. OUR description of this sort of falsehood leads us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime not com∣plete without uttering.</NOTE> in
the next place, to observe, (but this it has in common with all
the other species of the offence), that the crime is not com∣plete
by the fabrication of the writing, unless it be also utter∣ed
or put to use. For if when executed it is kept lying with
the artist, unemployed, and is only by some accident brought
to light, (in the course, perhaps, of search for some other
writing), the evidence is wanting, though such a discovery
must needs be attended with suspicion, of the fraudulent
and felonious purpose of the fabrication; wherein lies the
essence of the crime. Or grant that evidence were even
recovered of the pannel's dishonest purpose, as by his own
letters bearing his intention to utter the false writing at
such a time and place, still it is no more than a naked pur∣pose,
just as in the case of a libel, composed, but not pu∣blished,
or an incendiary letter written, but not despatched,
and of which it is not too late to repent, as long as it has
not given birth to any act or measure, which may be to
the prejudice of society or of a neighbour. It is therefore
<PB N="216" REF="275"/>
the act of uttering, which first bestows a form and consumma∣tion
on the crime, such as gives the magistrate a title to en∣quire
into it: Till then, it is mere wickedness of heart, for
which the offender answers not to any human tribunal.</P>
<P>IT is true, that by common style of all indictment for this
crime, the forging, and the uttering or vending of the deed,
are severally charged, and a relevancy is sought on either.
But this form of libel, which is only of modern introduc∣tion,
is meant to meet the case of the pannel being found
art and part of the uttering only, (which is of equal guilt as
the forgery), and not of the fabrication; and the charge of
forgery in such a libel is not to be understood of the naked
fabrication, as in contradistinction to the uttering, but on
the contrary, as in connection with that act, which is a ne∣cessary
ingredient of the crime, and is implied in the simple
term forgery, wherever it is used. In the case, accord∣ingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1780.</NOTE>
of David Reid, where this alternative sort of charge
occurred, the objection taken to it was repelled, and the li∣bel
sent to an assize.</P>
<P>AND here we may take occasion to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forger presu∣med art and part of uttering.</NOTE> how contrary
forever it may be to first appearances, that in truth it is not as
fabricator purely, but as presumptively accessory to the ut∣tering,
which completes the crime, that the maker of the
false writing is punished, when he is not <HI>proved</HI> to be the
vender also. Having been executed by him, and being un∣der
his power, from the very nature of the situation
the writing cannot in ordinary cases pass out of his hands,
or be uttered, without his privity and concurrence: for
which reason, even in the more favourable case of another
person appearing to be the vender, it will still be presumed
against the fabricator, and need not be shown by proof upon
<PB N="217" REF="276"/>
the prosecutor's part, (at least, with the aid of ever so little
communication between the vender and fabricator it will
be presumed), that they were leagued in the adventure, and
had, each of them, his separate department, with the consent
of the other. If the fabricator deny this, it will rather
lie with him, who has a strong presumption against him that
he did not fabricate for nothing, to specify and prove the
manner wherein the writing passed from him without his
will; as by being withdrawn from his repositories, the loss
of it with his pocket-book, or the like.</P>
<P>IT is no less material to observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is a suffi∣cient uttering.</NOTE> with respect to what shall
be accounted an uttering of the writing, that the great danger
of this crime has established a very rigorous construction a∣gainst
the pannel. Not only it is no obstacle to the prosecu∣tion,
that the money or other thing procured by the forgery
has been refunded to the private party, so that no one ul∣timately
suffers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. &amp; 19. 1711.</NOTE> (which happened in the case of Robert
Fleming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 18. 19. 21. 1788.</NOTE> and of George Mackerracher); but it is not even
material that the writing should ever pass, or the imposition,
even for a moment, take effect. He hath published the false
writing for genuine, and his crime of <HI>forgery</HI> is complete, as
soon as he has produced or employed it towards the pre∣judice
of another; whereby not only is his felonious in∣tention
manifest, but instead of being under his power as
before, the false deed is communicated to a stranger, and
the last step is taken that depends on him to accomplish the
intended deception. The libel is therefore good, if the false
bond has been made the ground of action or diligence,
though no money has been recovered; or if it has been
produced and pleaded, or claimed upon in judgment, though
not <HI>abidden by</HI> upon challenge, (for this seems to be only
<PB N="218" REF="277"/>
a contrivance for shortening the civil process of improba∣tion
of the writing); as in the case of William and Tho∣mas
Mackie, January 16. and February 2. 1636, who were
pillored, declared infamous, and banished, for pleading on
a false discharge of a bond: or if the judicial bond of cau∣tionry
has been tendered to the proper officer; as was found
relevant in the case of Andrew Adam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 20. 1710.</NOTE> relative to a bond of
caution in suspension<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords “found the pannell's actual forging, or his causeing and intyseing others to forge, the subscriptions to the bond of cautionrie lybelled, or his ac∣tually giveing in of the same with his own hand to the Bill chamber, to obtain a suspension, relevant to infer the pain of death; and found the pannell's use∣making of the suspension, obtained on the said bond of cautionrie lybelled, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and repelled the defences proponed for the pannell.”</NOTE>: or if the bill or bank-note has been

the Court had repelled the defence, that it had never
been abidden by in judgment, nor used to the actual preju∣dice
of the party. To confirm which precedent, the Le∣gislature,
in the statute 1621, c. 22. declared, that it shall not
protect from the pains of falsehood to pass from the writing
upon challenge, or engage not to make use of it in future.
Notwithstanding this act, which is conceived in explicit
terms, doubts had however continued to be entertained con∣cerning
the bare production of a writing in judgment, or the
entry of it on record, how far either of these was to be
reputed an use of the writing, and a completion of the crime.
<PB N="219" REF="278"/>
For the same act of sederunt which convicts Alexander For∣rest
of falsehood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. 1650.</NOTE> and remits him to Parliament for punish∣ment,
also makes this request, “That ane new act thair∣anent
may be made for cleiring what sall be the punish∣ment
for such faults heirefter; and whether or not the
inserting of false wreattis in registeres, or produceing the
samyne in judgement, albeit they do not byde be them,
being challenceit theirfore, fall be fund to be a useing of
the saids false wreattes and punischable.” This request
does not seem to have been complied with. But it has ever
been held in all modern practice, that a writing is to this
effect sufficiently used by the bare production in judgment;
which in substance is always the founding of a right or plea
upon it as a genuine voucher. And with respect also to the
registration; if either it be a registration for diligence, or
such which is ordered by law, as in the case of seisins,
hornings, and some others, the same rule shall probably be
held: for in all these instances the entry on record is the
public assertion of a claim upon the writing as good. If it
is recorded for preservation only, there is more room for
argument upon the other side; and this question has not
yet been tried.</P>
<P>6. ONE thing more is implied in our description of this
sort of falsehood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forging, &amp;c. must be feloni∣ous.</NOTE> That the making and uttering of the deed
be felonious, or with intent to injure. Thus it is not a
forgery, if to accommodate another who cannot write, and
at his desire, a person shall sign a draught or receipt in the
name of that other; as often happens among persons of low
degree. For there is no imposition here, either done or in∣tended,
in the transaction. Mackenzie takes notice of such
a case, which had fallen under his own observation<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Falsehood, No. 6,</NOTE>. On
<PB N="220" REF="279"/>
the other part, the law will understand it to be fraudulent,
and to the prejudice of another, if there be a purpose to
gain any sort of advantage by the falsehood, though this
should not be of so high a degree, as amounts to the cheat∣ing
out of the sum or thing to which the writing relates.
Thus it is forgery, (though possibly the excuse might be
considered in the sentence), to frame a false bill, bond, or
other voucher for ever so just a debt, or a discharge for
money which was truly paid, but the payment forgotten to
be vouched; for still the offender has made a false deed, and
is thus far benefited, and the other party prejudiced, that
he has written evidence of the state of the transaction, and
therein enjoys that security which he coveted, and thought
worth attaining at such a hazard.</P>
<P>I SHALL now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part of Forgery.</NOTE> before proceeding, subjoin a few things con∣cerning
the different ways in which one may be involved in
the guilt of forgery. <HI>First;</HI> one is art and part by im∣mediate
assistance lent to the fabrication itself; so that if
one person furnish the scroll of the false deed, another
dictate the deed from that scroll, a third write it, and a
fourth affix the false subscription in presence of the rest,
all four are alike guilty of the crime. This was nearly the
situation of parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1597.</NOTE> in the case of Halliday and others, where
Marjoribanks the notary dictated a scroll of the false dis∣charge
to Halliday, (after consultation between them upon
the matter), by whom it was sent to Lowrie, who filled it
up in the blank-signed paper, with the assistance of Alexan∣der
Lowrie and John Winzet, the last of whom signed a
false name of witness to the deed. All these persons had
sentence of death; and as to Halliday this was the only
charge in the libel. The same sort of accession happened
<PB N="221" REF="280"/>
in the case of James Tarbet and Finlay Ferne, February 15.
1600; for Tarbet, according to a scroll delivered to him
by Ferne, wrote part, and employed John Kennedy to write
the remainder of a charter, to which he saw Ferne affix his
father's name. In regard to those who act as witnesses on
such occasions; though they sign their own names, and after
their ordinary fashion, they are not the less art and part
of forgery, since they thus knowingly confirm the false sub∣scription
of party.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly;</HI> IT has already been intimated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part by using false Writ.</NOTE> that the user or
vender of a false writ, being a different person from the
fabricator, is nevertheless equally punishable as he, and
that it is even as presumptively art and part of the vending,
that the fabricator himself is punished, when he is not pro∣ved
to be the vender too. This point is equally clear upon
the course of practice, the opinion of lawyers, and the au∣thority
of our statutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540, c. 80. 1551, c. 22.</NOTE> some of which are upon this head
express. The plain reason is, that even when the vender
has not from the first been privy to the process of fabrica∣tion,
(which, however, he often is), he by wittingly using
the false deed, becomes participant of, and associates him∣self
to the whole guilt of that contrivance, which he adopts
in its more mature state, and by his industry brings to the
desired accomplishment and issue; in like manner as the pu∣blisher
of a libel is participant of the guilt of the composi∣tion,
which by his art he disseminates to the world. It is
also to be considered, that the user of a false writing, more
especially if it be drawn directly in his own favour, must
in reason be presumed to be himself the falsifier too, unless
he can by evidence throw off that charge upon another<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Lex 33. Dig. L. 4. Cod. ad L. Corn. de falsis.</NOTE>.
<PB N="222" REF="281"/>
Among other instances of capital sentence for uttering only,
I may quote that upon John Macaffee<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the said John Macaffee guilty art and part of forging promissory. notes of the British Linen Company, as laid in the libel; and all in one voice find the 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th articles of the libel all proven. But find the other articles of the libel not proven.” The 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th articles were charges of uttering. See the printed Report of this case in the Appendix to Stuart and Craigie's Collection of Decisions. The debate is blank in the Record.</NOTE>; whose conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26. 1782.</NOTE>
however intended by the jury, could only be construed as
relative to certain articles of that sort of charge.</P>
<P>THE same statutes which extend to the users of false wri∣tings,
are equally levelled, and with as good reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part by procuring For∣gery.</NOTE> against the
seducers and corrupters, at whose instigation the false instru∣ment
has been made. This rule of judgment was applied
to the case already mentioned, of Robert Innes and Finlay
Ferne, of whom the latter was the suborner of the other, to
forge a seisin on the false charter, and therefore suffered death
along with him. It will not, however, often happen, that the
procurer of the forgery so thoroughly abstains from all direc∣tion
or assistance towards the execution of the purpose, or
from all use of the writing when made, as to be implicated
in the crime upon that ground alone. In the case, for in∣stance,
of Nisbet, that person was the user, as well as procurer
of the forgery, which was executed by one Houshold, whom
she had ensnared into the employment<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See the Report of this Case in Arnot.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of remote As∣sistance in For∣gery.</NOTE> the question arises concerning assistance of a
remote kind lent towards the fabrication, how far this makes
the assister art and part of the capital offence: As in the
<PB N="223" REF="282"/>
case of the artist who makes the plate, or the paper, for
throwing off the false bank note. The decision in such cases
will depend on circumstances. If, (which has sometimes
been the case), it can be shown that the tradesman not on∣ly
knew the unlawful destination of his commodity, but was
in a society with the forger and vender, by which they were
severally to perform their parts in the adventure, and to
receive their share of the profits thence accruing; this seems
to be nothing less than an accession to the forgery: for there
is here one joint and undivided undertaking, in which each
is participant of what is done by the other, and must answer
for it, as if done by himself. Instead of this, if there be no
more in the case but an employment of the tradesman to exe∣cute
such a piece of work in his trade, he is not thereby in∣volved
in any cognisable degree of guilt; not even though
he should have reason to suspect the evil purpose to which
his handy-work is to be applied. This, at least, was the
judgment of the Court upon such a case, or rather a more
unfavourable one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. &amp; 14. 1781.</NOTE> that of John Brown, against whom this
verdict was returned: “Find it proven, that the brass plate
mentioned in the libel, was engraven by the said John
Brown, and that he was privy to the concealing of the
same in a whin-bush in the moor of Falkirk; but find that
it is not proven that he adhibited the subscription to, or
issued any of the three notes libelled on and produced.”
The judgment was to assoilzie the pannel <HI>simpliciter.</HI> But
between these there lies a middle, though more unlikely si∣tuation,
that of a tradesman who has a special privity to the
evil object of his employment, and receives on that account
a reward or extraordinary hire, but has no farther concern,
in the adventure or its profits. It may be thought, that up∣on.
<PB N="224" REF="283"/>
on such a delinquent, when the case shall happen, some pu∣nishment
may suitably be inflicted.</P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Notaries, how punishable.</NOTE> I SHALL now say nothing more of that sort of false∣hood,
which consists in the publishing of a deed as the signed
deed of another. It is a different species of the crime, if a
notary shall draw false instruments of seisin, intimation or the
like, which never was given, or an officer of the law return
executions of things which never were done, or were done
otherwise than is set forth in these reports. For he is not
giving forth his own act as that of another man, or putting
himself into the person of another; he is merely in his own
person, and in his official character, telling, a most flagrant,
impudent, and dangerous lie. Nevertheless, although in the
matter of officers executions this distinction seems to have
been acknowledged, and a milder course to have been ta∣ken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 15. &amp; 28. 1605.</NOTE>
as appears from the case of Strachan the messenger,
who for four false executions of charge and denunciation,
was only scourged and deprived of his office; yet with re∣spect
to notaries, whose trust of office is higher, and their
functions of still more consequence, and such as deeply affect
the lieges in their most valuable estates, the contrary seems
to have been holden. The act 1540, c. 80. was more espe∣cially
directed against the falsehood of notaries; and in like
manner as the other statutes were held to authorise the in∣slicting
of death in other cases, this seems to have been held
a warrant for the same severity upon this class of men, whose
fidelity is so important to be guarded. Thus, on the same day
that Ferne and Tarbet were condemned to die for forging a
charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. &amp; 16. 1600.</NOTE> Robert Innes notary had the like sentence for a
false and antedated seisin, wittingly made by him upon it.
Whether the seisin in that case bore the names of wit∣nesses,
<PB N="225" REF="284"/>
or, if it did, whether these also were forged, does
not appear from the record. But though the case be,
that the notary does not sign the names of pretended wit∣nesses,
but induces persons to sign along with him in that
capacity, the wickedness and the guilt seem to be much
the same: In either case, the whole seisin is still a fiction
of the notary's own contrivance, and he is art and part
of the false subscriptions of his associates.</P>
<P>THE case of Innes is not the only instance of this con∣struction
of the law. On the 20th December 1616, Alex∣ander
Cook notary, Sheriff-clerk of Berwickshire, upon a
libel which is laid on the act 1540, for falsehood in his
office of notary, had sentence of death; having vitiated
the entry of a seisin in his protocol-book, and having gi∣ven
forth two extracts of it, of different dates, and judici∣ally
sworn at different times to the truth of both, Farther;
it had been thought to be of little moment, whether the
notorial instrument were false by corruption and abuse of
trust in a real notary, or through the false assumption of
that character by one who was no notary, and who of course
could give no true instrument of that kind. For this sort
of falsehood, William Norval was condemned to die on the
9th June 1602, and John Moscrop, writer in Edinburgh, on
the 8th February 1597. Also, among other charges, Tho∣mas
Marjoribanks was convicted as a false and pretended
notary, on the same libel with Moscrop, and had sentence of
death. No instance of either of these kinds of falsehood
has been brought to trial in later times.</P>
<P>I SHALL now dismiss these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discretion of the Court in punishing For∣gery.</NOTE> the capital falsifications of
writing, with this general observation, that though the Court
may, they are not however constrained, invariably to inflict
<PB N="226" REF="285"/>
the pain of death for such offences, but have a discretion∣ary
power, as in the case of theft, to accommodate the pain
to the whole circumstances of the offender, and of the trans∣gression.
Thus, in the criminal Court, in September 1630,
Richard Home, for forging a testimonial and pasport under
the hand of the Chancellor of Ireland, and of the Earl of
Cork, had sentence to be scourged, burned in the hand, and
banished. In like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 16. and Feb. 2. 1636.</NOTE> William and Thomas Mackie,
convicted of forging a discharge for L. 100 Scots, were sen∣tenced
to pillory, infamy, confiscation of moveables, and
banishment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4. 1638.</NOTE> William Forsyth notary, for forging a charter,
was declared infamous, pilloried, and banished. As was
Lawson for using a false discharge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26. &amp; 28. 1650.</NOTE> at the same time that
Blair, the maker of the discharge, was hanged. More
lately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3. 1793.</NOTE> John Grant was transported for forging the indorsa∣tion
of a bill of L. 20. In like manner, the civil Court,
instead of remitting to the Justiciary, have, in many instan∣ces,
inflicted an arbitrary pain themselves<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See in the Books of Sederunt the case of James Adie, and Marion Shaw, Ju∣ly 28. 1739. William Fraser, February 28. 1741; David Young, July 18. 1741; William Stevenson, Feb. 18. 1747; John Tennant, November 14. 1751; John Smith, March 2. 1753; Murdoch Campbell, August 7. 1756.</NOTE></P>
<P>III. I CANNOT discover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falsification of Writs, how pu∣nishable.</NOTE> that, beside the two species already
spoken of, any other falsification of writing has, at any period
of our practice, been thought necessary to be chastifed with
the same severity. Some there are, which, in respect of
prejudice to the party who is meant to be injured, and
almost in respect of the wickedness of the contriver, may
seem to be little short of those to which the name of for∣gery,
in its stricter sense, is applied. If the holder of a bill
alter the sum to his own advantage, or if the writer of a
<PB N="227" REF="286"/>
deed insert provisions, without the knowledge of his employ∣er,
in favour of himself or of others; certainly an act, which
is not the act of the party, is here published as authentica∣ted
by his hand, equally as in the case of his subscription
being counterfeited. But as devices of this kind are neither
so frequent nor so dangerous as forgeries, by reason of the
greater difficulty which attends the execution of them, and
as in point of boldness at least, if not of depravity, there
is some difference between the corruption of a genuine signed
writing, and the supposition and signing of an entire deed in
the name of another, so the lenity of our practice seems to
have laid hold of this distinction, how slender soever, to save
the offender's life<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The statute 7th Geo. II. c. 22. which makes such offences capital in Eng∣land, does not seem to extend to this country.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the indulgence goes no farther. As great frauds and
falsehoods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentences for falsified Writ.</NOTE> such contrivances are punishable with us at com∣mon
law with pillory, infamy, and imprisonment, and in a
flagrant case, even with transportation, added to these pains.
And this holds good as to all the different modes of false
writing; whether it be by false assertion in the instrument,
as if it be antedated, or if a person falsely sign as wit∣ness
to an execution; or by corruption of the written
words thereof in the way of rasure, superinduction, in∣terpolation,
or the like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. 1737.</NOTE> Thus Belsches and others were
imprisoned and suspended, for antedating the registration of
a bond;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July. 19. 1788.</NOTE> James Wright was pilloried for signing witness to
executions without seeing the things done;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 2. 1750.</NOTE> Daniel Aitken,
messenger, for altering material words in a letter, was de∣prived,
imprisoned, and made incapable of trust; Robert
<PB N="228" REF="287"/>
Paton, for calumniously denying his subscription, and trying
to reduce it as a forgery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 9. 1762.</NOTE> was imprisoned and stood in the
pillory; William Dunbar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26. 1762.</NOTE> for rasing and otherwise vitiating
an interlocutor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. 1763.</NOTE> had sentence of transportation for life;
James Leatch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 6. 1766.</NOTE> for vitiating a bill, had sentence of infamy,
and to stand twice in the pillory. These judgments were
given in the civil Court.</P>
<P>IN the Court of Justiciary also, Thomas Taylor, charged
with attempting to alter two L. 5 bank-notes, into notes for
L. 10, was transported for five years on his own petition,
Aug. 11. 1753<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There were favourable circumstances in this case. Particularly, the prison∣er seems himself to have revealed his offence to the Directors of the Bank.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT by far the strongest illustration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence for fal∣sified Writ.</NOTE> and which may serve
instead of all others to prove the disposition of our practice,
and the vigour of our common law in this department, is
the case of Thomas Mathie, tried in the criminal Court, 10th
March 1727. This man had been factor to the York-build∣ings
Company on their estate of Winton; and the charge
against him was, that after recal of his factory, he had up∣lifted
or had taken bills for certain rents and sums of mo∣ney
addebted to the Company, and had given discharges of
them, which, as well as the bills, he antedated, to conceal
the fraud, and that in one instance, he had cancelled a bill
payable to the Company, and taken a new one of a false
date, and in his own name, for the sum. These things were
charged as being, in some measure, of the same nature with
the counterfeiting of a new power of factory; in as much as
through these false devices, his unwarrantable acts of admini∣stration
were in appearance brought within the term of his ex∣pired
power; and this for the fraudulent purpose of bringing
<PB N="229" REF="288"/>
the effects of the Company into his own hands. The libel was
found relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">March 20. 1727. The Lords “find, that the said Thomas Mathie, pannel, after intimation was made to him that his factory upon the estate of Winton, from the Company of Undertakers for raising the Thames water in York-build∣ings, was revoked, and a new factory from said Company was granted in fa∣vours of Mr Henry Streatchy, pursuer, and Mr Archibald Robertson; that the pannel did thereafter grant receipts and discharges to, or did take accepted bills from the persons debtors to the said Company in the produce of the said estate, on account either of rents, coal, salt, or pan-wood, and did antedate the saids receipts, discharges or bills, by making them to bear date prior to the re∣calling of his factory, though they were really granted posterior thereto; the pannel's so doing, in all or any of the particular instances specified in the libel, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and repelled the haill defences pro∣poned for the pannel.”</NOTE>; and the pannel being convicted of one ar∣ticle
of the charge, relative to the colliers' and salters' bills,
was fined and found liable in expences. It cannot therefore
be doubted, with respect to any false certificate granted by
a person in his office, such as certificate of marriage, bap∣tism,
proclamation of banns or the like, that this sort of fla∣grant
lie and breach of trust falls under the same rule, and
is an article of criminal charge; though no trial of that kind
has hitherto taken place.</P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of process for Forgery.</NOTE> SUFFICIENT has now been said concerning the falsi∣fication
of writings. Let us next attend to the form of pro∣cess;
which, from the remotest period of our practice, has
been subject to this peculiarity, that it may equally be
brought in the Court of Session, or of Justiciary; and more∣over,
(in which respect its situation is still more extraordi∣nary),
that though commencing in the civil Court, it often
times terminates and comes to issue in the other.</P>
<P>THE causes are obvious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of Session can try Forgery.</NOTE> which have led to the receiving
of the Lords of Session, as Judges competent in the matter
<PB N="230" REF="289"/>
of forgery. The crime often comes to light in the course
of process depending in that Court; whence arises a con∣tingent
jurisdiction over the offender, who is chastised sum∣marily
and without delay, in the very tribunal where he
has transgressed, for his scandalous attempt to impose upon
their wisdom, and to pervert the course of justice. Another,
and an equally substantial reason, lies in the very difficult and
tedious nature, generally speaking, of the proof of forgery,
which is often impossible to be absolved, as must be the case
with every trial by assize and in the criminal Court, in the
course of a single fitting.</P>
<P>IN addition to these reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are they exclu∣sive Judges in first instance.</NOTE> which of themselves are suf∣ficient
to justify this departure from ordinary rules, Mac∣kenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Falsehood, No. 4.</NOTE> hath farther supposed, that certain statutes have ex∣pressly
bestowed this jurisdiction on the Lords of Session.
Nay, he has expressly said that they are Judges in the first
Instance, exclusive of the criminal Court; in confirmation
of which opinion he appeals to the judgment in the case of
Lord Blantyre, and affirms that the books of adjournal do
not contain an instance of process for forgery commencing
in that Court. But in all this there is somewhat of inaccu∣racy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1555, c. 47.</NOTE>
Though the act of Mary for the punishment of false
witnesses has supposed, (for it does not introduce) the jurisdic∣tion
of the civil Court in the matter of perjury; no one of the
statutes concerning false notaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 7. 1664.</NOTE> or false writings, has any
expressions to the like purpose. And in the case of Blan∣tyre,
neither did the Justices give any such judgment as
Mackenzie has supposed, nor had they any opportunity of
doing so; seeing the forgery was not insisted on as a sepa∣rate
crime, but only as an aggravation of the charge of
<PB N="231" REF="290"/>
theft. This <HI>dictum</HI> of Mackenzie has not therefore govern∣ed
the practice of later times; which, on the contrary, af∣fords
sundry instances of process for forgery commencing,
as well as ending, in the criminal Court. Two cases may
in particular be attended to; that of Nicolson and Elliot
in January 1694, and of John Howison in November 1705,
in the first of which, the plea of incompetency was argued,
and Mackenzie's treatise referred to in support of the objec∣tion.
Judgment was also given against this plea, first in Sir
Robert Dunbar's case<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The said Lords find this Court competent to cognosce upon the crime of falsehood or forgery; but in respect neither the principal seisin nor the records are produced, therefore find that article as libelled not relevant.”</NOTE>, and afterwards in the case of Wil∣liam
Baillie and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1714.</NOTE> where, “as to the crime of forgery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 6. 1715.</NOTE>
or using of false or forged passes, libelled against the said
William Baillie, the said Lords find the Court competent
to judge thereupon. But in regard it appears from the
debate that the only means of improving the said passes
are indirect, therefore, remit the same to be tried by and
cognosced summarily before the Lords of Session.”</P>
<P>IN later times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If exclusive where proof is indirect.</NOTE> this general position has therefore been
abandoned for the more limited plea, suggested by the last
mentioned judgment, that the Lords of Session are at least
exclusive Judges in all cases, such as that of Baillie, where
the proof is in the <HI>indirect</HI> and more tedious way of circum∣stantial
evidence. In the case of <HI>James</HI> Baillie, where this
position was maintained, the interlocutor seems rather to
wave the question;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11. 1765.</NOTE> finding only, “in respect of the peculiar
circumstances of the case, that it is <HI>inexpedient</HI> to go on
in this trial before this Court <HI>in prima instantia”</HI> and
therefore dismissing the process. Thus the question seems
<PB N="232" REF="291"/>
to be still open to a judgment; which if it shall distin∣guish
the competent jurisdiction according to the nature
of the evidence, and not according to the matter of the
process, will establish the one instance of this kind that oc∣curs
in the whole circuit of our law.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the process to the Court of Session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of the Action.</NOTE>
may be in two different ways. It may be by summons of
reduction and improbation, raised by the private party, with
concourse of the Lord Advocate; and upon which, if the
writings are produced, they may be <HI>improven,</HI> and the de∣fender,
if in custody and appearing, may be found guil∣ty
of the forgery, and punished, or remitted to the cri∣minal
Court. I say, if the party appear, and the writings
are produced; for the accused cannot be tried in absence to
the effect of remitting, or of inflicting any pain; neither can
the writings be improven, but only suffer certification, unless
they are produced; as was found in the case of Captain Bar∣clay,
January 26. 1670<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Stair's Decisions.</NOTE>. The other way, and which has
more commonly been followed in later times, is <HI>per modum
simplicis querelae;</HI> in the form of summary complaint, at in∣stance
either of the Lord Advocate, or of the private party
with his concourse, and which, in substance, is the same
as an indictment, and must, along with its list of wit∣nesses,
and list of assize, be served upon the pannel in
the like form, and upon the same <HI>induciae,</HI> as an indictment
is. This way of proceeding, which in Mackenzie's time was
reckoned extraordinary, and was only allowed in case of for∣gery
of some part of process, or forgery committed by a mem∣ber
of the College of Justice, hath, during the greater part
of the present century, been employed without any regard
<PB N="233" REF="292"/>
to these circumstances, and in particular has been the
constant mode in the many trials for the forgery of bank-notes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The trial of Gilchrist and Brodie commenced in that way in 1719, It is mentioned in Lord Royston's notes, that in the case of the Royal Bank against Wallace in July 1742, for forging bank-notes, which was brought into Court by complaint, some of the Lords thought that the cognisance of that form only be∣longed to the Justiciary; but in the end the jurisdiction was sustained.</NOTE>. There is, however, nothing to hinder it from be∣ing
employed jointly with a summons of improbation; and
this course was followed both in the case of Mrs Nisbet in
1727, and of Adie and Shaw, July 28. 1739<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Acts of Sederunt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in Court of Ses∣sion.</NOTE> when duly brought into Court, the
course of proceeding is by hearing parties on the relevan∣cy
of the libel and defences, and by judgment given on
these; after which proof is taken on both sides, in pre∣sence
of the Court. The proof may either be direct, by
testimony of the persons whole names are forged, or indi∣rect,
by comparison of hands, <HI>alibi,</HI> and other circumstantial
evidence: which two sorts of proof, according to the later
practice, may be employed at the same time, or even the
indirect upon failure of the other; since it is always possible
that the instrumentary witnesses may mistake or be cor∣rupted<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Dictionary of Decisions, vol. i. p. 458.</NOTE>. After proof taken, and full hearing of parties
on it, and a final close of all the pannel's relevant allega∣tions,
who in this respect enjoys a benefit of bringing for∣ward
new pleas, and obtaining farther proofs, which no
pannel in the Justiciary can pretend to, the Court pro∣ceed
<PB N="234" REF="293"/>
to give their sentence, as well on his guilt or innocence
of the charge, as on the verity or falsehood of the writings.
But with respect to the tenor of the sentence in the article
of inflicting punishment, two situations are to be distinguish∣ed.
The one is, where in the opinion of the Court it is fit
to punish with an arbitrary pain; which they then award
themselves, and which may be carried to any extent that
is short of death: and the other is, where the public interest
requires the forfeit of the offender's life; for which end,
having no power to pronounce such a doom themselves, they
must remit the pannel to the Court of Justiciary; there to
undergo a new trial and condemnation.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of this remit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in the Court of Jus∣ticiary.</NOTE> an indictment is framed,
charging the pannel with the fact, as in common style, and
which is served upon him with a list of assize, and of wit∣nesses,
and of articles to be produced in evidence, on the or∣dinary
<HI>induciae,</HI> and in the accustomed form. The list of wit∣nesses
is however very brief; only consisting of persons, who,
if there shall be occasion for it by his denial, (as in the case
of Raybould),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, p. 472.</NOTE> may prove that he is the same person who was
convicted in the Court of Session<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The following words are part of the Sollicitor-General, Mr Charles Erskine's notes in the case of John Campbell, in March and April 1731. “In this trial, after the reading of the diet, the procurators for the pannel attempted two ob∣jections, 1 <HI>st,</HI> It was said that the extract was not proven. It was signed by one John Dalrymple, of whom they pretended to know nothing; but this was ridiculed by the Judges. 2<HI>do,</HI> It was urged, that there was no proof that the pannel was the person found guilty by the Lords of Session. But it being notour to the whole Court, that he had been constantly kept in prison during the course of the trials, both before the Session and Justiciary, the Lords al∣so disregarded this objection.” These words are copied from the notes upon the printed papers in Mr Erskine's hand-writing. But no such objections appear in the record.</NOTE>; and the productions are
<PB N="235" REF="294"/>
only the extracted decree of the Court of Session, and the
forged writings themselves, authenticated by the subscrip∣tion
of the President of that Court. For in this, by imme∣morial
custom, the condition of such a trial for forgery is
quite singular, that it comes before the criminal Court in
the shape of a concluded cause as to the matter of proof;
in which the prosecutor is not at liberty to examine wit∣nesses,
or to bring any, whatsoever, farther evidence, but
must entirely rest his prosecution on that which is contain∣ed
in the extracted decree of the Lords of Session, to which
the libel refers, as the sole proof intended to be used.</P>
<P>WHAT is true on the prosecutor's part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is new Proof competent there.</NOTE> is equally true on
the part of the pannel also; who, in his trial before the
Lords of Session, has already had such advantages in point
of prorogation of diet, allowance of new defences, addi∣tional
proofs, and the like, as no pannel in trial before the
Court of Justiciary can, in any the most favourable case, be
indulged with. It is the maxim in the civil Court, “<HI>nunquam
concluditur in falso:</HI>” that is to say, that as long as the
case is in Court, and is not closed by extract of the decree,
the Judges will not refuse to listen to any relevant defence,
though late of being resorted to, nor exclude new light, if
from any quarter it seem likely to be let in upon the
case. To them, therefore, and not to the criminal Court,
the pannel's request of additional evidence should have been
made. And indeed, if a farther proof in exculpation were
allowed him, then, in justice, must the prosecutor also be al∣lowed
a farther proof in reply, and this too by witnesses
not contained in the original list which was served upon the
pannel; and thus the inquiry would be drawn out to the
length of many diets, and in a manner quite irreducible to
<PB N="236" REF="295"/>
the shape of a jury-trial, as well as to the entire disappoint∣ment
of all those reasons for which the charge is allowed
to commence in the civil Court, and to the occasioning of
those very difficulties, both to Court and jury, which were
meant to be avoided by this course of process. Hence in
Raybould's case, though the Lord Advocate consented to the
production of certain papers, which had been exhibited in
the civil Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. 1768.</NOTE> but were not remitted, and of which the
pannel meant to avail himself towards some new defence;
this was <HI>ex mera gratia</HI> of the prosecutor, and was done under
protest entered in the record, that he should not be held to
have acquicsced in the lawfulness of the demand. In the
later case of David Reid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1780.</NOTE> the Lords on such an application
found, “That it is not competent for the pannel to adduce
any proof, other or farther, in his exculpation or allevia∣tion,
than what is contained in the decree of that Court,
referred to in the indictment, and therefore they refuse to
allow the witnesses to be examined.”</P>
<P>Now here arises a question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decree of Ses∣sion; is it <HI>pro∣batio probata?</HI></NOTE> both curious and important.
As the decree of the Lords of Session is thus the sole evi∣dence
which the prosecutor is allowed to produce; is it also
to be accounted conclusive and irrefragable evidence, (<HI>pro∣batio
probata</HI>), according to which the jury are necessitated
to condemn; or are they at liberty to look into the depo∣sitions
engrossed in the decree, and to acquit the pannel, if in
their mind the proof is not sufficient to convict him? The
first has been maintained; and in former times it seems even
to have been the prevailing opinion on the subject. Macken∣zie
has expressly said, that the decree is read for sole pro∣bation,
“and that the assize must condemn thereupon, else
<PB N="237" REF="296"/>
they will be pursued for error;” in confirmation of which
he elsewhere adds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Falsehood, No. 7. Tit. Jurisdiction of Lords of Session, No. 3.</NOTE>, (but on this it is to be observed, that no
such thing appears on the record), that in the case of Bin∣ning,
in 1662, the Lords refused to receive a verdict of ac∣quittal,
and obliged the assize to reinclose and condemn.
Even in later times this opinion was not abandoned. It is
laid down as law by Erskine<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Crimes, No. 72.</NOTE>; and in the case of Margaret
Nisbet, it was even endeavoured to be established in a more
direct and palpable form, than had ever before been tried.
The libel in that case concluded to have a relevancy found,
not only upon the pannel's guilt of the charge as made in
the libel, but also upon the mode of proof of her guilt, as by
the decree of the Court of Session <HI>per se.</HI> The conclusion is in
these words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. 1727.</NOTE> “All which or any part thereof being found
proven against her the said Margaret Nisbet, and particu∣larly
it being <HI>found proven,</HI> that the said writings above
mentioned, or any of them, <HI>were found</HI> to be fabricated,
false, or forged, <HI>by the said sentence</HI> of the Court of Ses∣sion,
and that she was by <HI>the same sentence found guilty,</HI>
or art and part of the said forgeries, or any of them;
by the verdict of an assize before our Lords Justice-General,
Justice-Clerk, and Commissioners of Justiciary,
she ought to be punished with the pains of death.”
This was to ask in plain terms, that the Court by their in∣terlocutor,
should bind down the jury to convict upon the
single ground, that such a decree had been given by the
Lords of Session. And to that effect the Lord Advocate
did urge his plea in the debate; appealing in support
of it to the constant style of verdict in such cases, which
<PB N="238" REF="297"/>
had always been to convict the pannel “in respect of the
decree of the Court of Session;” so that (said he), though
the same words and form of phrase may not have been used
in former libels, yet truly this was their substance and mean∣ing.
As far as can be judged from the interlocutor upon
record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lords find, “That the pannel being guilty of forging the bill and obliga∣tion or declaration libelled, or that she was art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of death,” &amp;c.</NOTE>, the Court had been desirous of avoiding to decide
on this debate; for it takes no notice of this conclusion ei∣ther
way, but finds a relevancy in common style, on the
pannel's being guilty, or art and part of forging the bill or
obligation libelled.</P>
<P>THE Lord Advocate had not, however, been discouraged.
For the same form of libel was again used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 26. 1731.</NOTE> and the same de∣bate
arose, in the case of John Campbell, where the prose∣cutor
argued, that the jury are here in the same case, as a
jury fitting on a felon who has returned from transportation,
or on a capital convict who has escaped; which jury must
find guilty in respect of the former verdict or sentence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1731.</NOTE> In∣terlocutor
was again given in the like general terms, as in
the case of Nisbet; and the jury returned a verdict of <HI>guilty,</HI>
without taking notice of the decree, or assigning any ground
of their opinion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I learn from the notes already referred to, which were taken by the Sollici∣tor-General at the time, Mr Charles Erskine, that the Court had spoken on this point, and had differed in opinion. “As to the second point pleaded, the President of the Court, and one of the Judges, declared their opinion, that the jury were to be determined upon the point of proof, by the decree of the Lords of Ses∣sion. Two of them (N. M.) made a sort of distinction, and said, that practice had so far settled the matter, that there was no necessity of examining the wit∣nesses before the jury, the depositions being engrossed in the decree, but that it was entire to the assize to examine the proof, how far they were satisfied with it.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="298"/>
I DO not find that the same conclusion has been inserted
in any libel of a later date; and Maclaurin, in his report
of the case of Raybould, mentions, That the Court were
agreed upon the right of the jury to acquit, if in their
own conscience they saw cause for it, as well as that in
this instance they did not rely on the authority of the
decree, but looked into the depositions, and were deter∣mined
thereby in their verdict. It does not seem probable,
that a different instruction shall be given on any future oc∣casion.
For as none of the reasons of commencing process
in the civil Court, seem to afford a just inference to the su∣staining
of their decree as conclusive of the issue, but rather
as the report of a commission entrusted to them by law, as
the body the most capable of taking such a proof, and of
forming an opinion whether the pannel should be put upon
trial for his life, and as that body which at any rate has
right to <HI>improve</HI> the writings as to their civil effects; so any
other opinion seems scarcely to be reconcileable to the dig∣nity
or the obligations of the office of an assize.</P>
<P>FROM this question arises another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decree Absolvi∣tor of Session; does it hinder farther Trial.</NOTE> If the decree of the
civil Court is thus not conclusive against the pannel, is it
conclusive in his favour when it acquits; or is it still com∣petent
to the prosecutor, to have him tried in a new and ori∣ginal
process brought against him in the criminal Court? I
do not find that this has ever been attempted, nor even that
any such opinion has ever been maintained. Having laid
his complaint, and taken his proof in that Court, and ac∣cording
to that form, which is competent by custom in the
trial of this crime, the prosecutor has joined issue with the
pannel, and, as in all other cases that have gone the length
of taking proof, must abide by the decision of the judicature,
<PB N="240" REF="299"/>
which has right to pronounce upon the evidence as brought
forward at the time. The opposite opinion would equal∣ly
expose the pannel to the suspense and misery of a se∣cond
trial, as if he were twice remitted to an assize; and
if against common rules, and out of necessity, the Court are
held as an assize, to the effect of taking a proof on which
he may lawfully be convicted, they must likewise be held
so to the effect of finishing the proof of his guilt, and
hindering all farther prosecution of him, other than shall be
laid upon and in pursuance of that proof.</P>
<P>ONE question more will require a word or two to be said
upon it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must capital pain follow on Re∣mit.</NOTE> Is the remit from the civil Court binding on the
Lords of Justiciary, to cause them pronounce <HI>sentence of death</HI>
upon the pannel; or are they at liberty to punish ac∣cording
to their own opinion of the case? Now, as to this;
Mackenzie, speaking of the verdict found in pursuance of
a remit, has said, “upon this verdict the Justices are tied
expressly to condemn the defender to be hanged<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit, Falsehood, No. 7.</NOTE>.” In
the case too of Margaret Nisbet, according to the form of
the libel, the sentence and remit were charged to be no
less obligatory on the Court to find a relevancy for the
pains of death; than on the jury to find the pannel guilty:
nay, according to Lord Royston's notes upon that case<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Falsehood, No. 25.</NOTE>, so
generally had this opinion of Mackenzie's been taken to be
good law, that it was rather regarded as a novelty, and
gave rise to debate on the bench, when that Judge main∣tained
the contrary at remitting her from the civil Court.
In truth, there were several things which had contributed
to spread the belief of such a doctrine. It had been taught,
<PB N="241" REF="300"/>
and was received, that the Court of Justiciary, in the first in∣stance,
were not even competent to this sort of trial, and
were only recurred to in capital cases, for the purpose of gi∣ving
out a sentence, which no civil Court could give. An∣ciently
too, the Court of Session had enjoyed a sort of supper∣eminence
to the Court of Justiciary, in virtue of which it
might be thought, that their opinion given upon any pro∣cess
which they remitted to the other, should be bind∣ing.
Farther, lawyers were affected by the ordinary course
of capital judgment following upon remit; this being
only made in flagrant cases, and such where there was little
doubt of the propriety of inflicting the highest pains. In
truth, there were however several precedents to the contrary;
the case of Strachan the messenger in 1605, of Forsyth in
1638, and of Lawson in 1650, (not to mention that of Craig,
a false witness, March 15. 1605); in all which cases only an
arbitrary punishment followed on the remit from the Lords
of Session. But even if there had been no such precedents,
Lord Royston's remark would still be just, that it is not easy to
imagine, how in a capital matter, and one which is properly
of their own cognisance, a sovereign Court shall be bound, to
the opinion of another judicature; and this difficulty will
appear the stronger if it be considered, that not a majority
only, but all the Judges of the Court of Justiciary, may
have been in the minority, as Judges of the Court of Session,
at remitting. The issue was in the case of Nisbet, that in
the criminal Court the prosecutor did not much insist on this
article of his libel; and that while the Judges thought upon
the case itself, that the woman was deserving of death, they
were however unanimously of opinion, that they had right
to punish, as on other occasions, according to conscience<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Lord Royston's note, which is printed entire in the appendix.</NOTE>,
and their own impressions of the degree of guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="301"/>
I SHALL now terminate this of the process for forgery, by
observing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can inferior Courts try for Forgery.</NOTE> that though the inferior courts must be allowed
to judge incidentally in the improbation of executions rela∣tive
to action before themselves, and of any writs which are
produced in such action, and are there challenged by way
of exception or reply; yet all process of reduction and im∣probation,
all original and separate process for punishment
of forgery, and all trial of any forgery in the indirect man∣ner,
seem to have been reserved, as matters of difficulty, for
the peculiar cognisance of the Supreme Courts<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See case of Williamson against Cushnie, ult. Nov. 1630, (Durie), Jan. 26. 1677, Cowan.</NOTE>: as also it is
understood, that no inferior Judge can in any case remit to
the Court of Justiciary.</P>
<P>V. THESE are some of the most material circumstances
pertaining to the forgery of writings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Forgery of Stamps.</NOTE> which is the most im∣portant
sort of falsehood, and chiefly rests upon the ground
of common law. Among the other species of falsehood,
those which are capital, and are not distinguished as sepa∣rate
crimes, by appropriated names, are to be found in the
department of the revenue law, and are referible to the autho∣rity
of statute. Provisions to that effect have in particular
been found necessary for the security of that very large and
important branch of the revenue, which is collected by means
of stamps, and, by the counterfeiting of these devices, might
be easily defrauded, to the great profit of the offender, as well
as to the injury of the fair dealer, and of the public. By the
various statutes, therefore, (not pretended to be here enume∣rated),
which introduced or augmented the stamp-duties
upon the several articles of leather, starch, perfumery, al∣manacks;
cards and dice; licence for ale, wine, or exciseable
<PB N="243" REF="302"/>
liquors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALSEHOOD.</NOTE> policy of insurance, receipts, bills of exchange,
and promissory-notes; as also upon paper, vellum, or o∣ther
material on which deeds, contracts, or obligations are
written; it has been made a capital crime to counterfeit
any of the seals, stamps, impressions, or other devices, by
means of which these duties are collected, or knowingly to
use or sell such counterfeit stamps, or privately and frau∣dulently
to affix and use the true stamps. By the 12th
Geo. III. c. 48. it is even made a felony, and punishable
with transportation for seven years, to insert any writing
in respect of which a stamp-duty is payable, upon the same
paper wherein any other writing chargeable with a stamp-duty
has been, or by any sort of operation to transfer the stamp
from one paper to another, or fraudulently to alter the con∣tents
of any writing engrossed upon stamped paper, to the
prejudice of the revenue.</P>
<P>UPON one of these laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 6. 20. 21. 24. 1716.</NOTE> the act of the 12th Anne, c. 9.
which imposes a duty on paper and vellum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> James Auch∣terlony
was tried and had sentence of death. Also on the 1st
August 1729, relevancy of the pains of law was found,
both at common law, and upon a statute of the 9th of Anne,
against Thomas Porteous, charged with forging the stamp
upon dressed hides<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the pannel, about the time libelled, his having counter∣feit or forged a stamp, or mark, provided, made or used in pursuance of the act libelled, entitled an act for laying on certain duties on hides and skins, or his being art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of law; and, <HI>separa∣tim,</HI> Found the pannel his having uttered, vended, or sold any hide or skin, with such counterfeit or forged mark thereon, knowing the same to be coun∣terfeit or forged, or his being art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of law; and repels the haill defences proponed for the pannel.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="303"/>
THOUGH statutes were requisite to warrant the pains of
death in such cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Law as to forging of Stamps.</NOTE> it is not however to be imagined,
(though the law of England in this respect may be differ∣ent),
that the offence of forging the revenue stamps is there∣fore
entirely statutory, and cannot to any extent be pu∣nished
at common law. As soon as any stamp-act passes,
this article of revenue is the lawful property of his Ma∣jesty
and his successors, and as much as any other property,
enjoys the protection of the common law of Scotland, which
will defend it from all manner of fraudulent devices, and
especially from all that are executed by means of false∣hood
or forgery, to injure or disappoint it; for it cannot
be thought that these are in the least more excusable, as
being directed to the prejudice of the Sovereign and the
public, and not to that of an individual.</P>
<P>THIS principle was exemplified in the case of Brown
and Macnab,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 18. 1793.</NOTE> starchmakers. These persons were charged,
both at common law and on the statute in that behalf, with
counterfeiting the stamp used in the collection of the duty
upon starch. So far as laid upon the statute, and for the
pains of death, the libel was found not relevant, by reason
of certain deviations from the statutory mode of affixing the
stamp. Nevertheless, as the mode actually practised had
the authority of the Board of Customs, and had been used
for some years, and been acquiesced in by the trade,
the Court were of opinion, and to that effect gave judg∣ment,
that the charge inferred the highest arbitrary pu∣nishment
at common law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“Find that the statute libelled on extends to Scotland; find that the crime charged in the minor proposition of the libel does not fall under the said sta∣tute; but find the libel as laid on the common law, relevant to infer the pains of law.”</P>
<P>On the 18th November 1793, John Macnab was again indicted, (for the first libel was not farther insisted in), by libel laid on the common law, and being convicted, he was banished forth of Scotland for 14 years.</P></NOTE>.</P>

affidavits or testimonies to the adultery of his wife; so as to
enable him to obtain a divorce. For this purpose Campbell,
by very foul means, of unlawful warrants and the like, having
got the woman's person into his possession, and having by
devices, (if possible still more wicked), stupified her and laid
her asleep, and having put a man to bed to her in that con∣dition,
he introduced certain persons into the chamber, there
<PB N="246" REF="305"/>
to see them in bed, and the man at the time either debauching
her, or making it to appear so. The persons thus made
witnesses of her shame, and meant to be afterwards made use
of in that capacity, were not privy to the contrivance<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This appears from several passages in the libel and informations.</NOTE>,
and were themselves imposed on. The crime could not
therefore be charged as subornation or attempt to suborn;
since the things to which those persons were to swear, they
believed to be true, and had actually seen. Nevertheless,
as the charge of wilful adultery to be inferred from those
facts, was itself an utter falsehood, to which those instru∣ments
were without their knowledge to be made subservient;
no doubt was entertained of the competency of punishing
it (and some of the Judges<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This I say on authority of the following note on the printed papers in my possession.</P>

DANIEL NICOLSON, writer in Edinburgh, was engaged in

arose a bitter enmity of both these persons to Jean Sands,
his lawful wife, and an earnest desire to get rid of her, in
order that they might marry, or at least enjoy their unlaw∣ful
intercourse more freely. Their first intention was to
dispatch her by poison; and thus far they went in the pro∣secution
of it, that they seduced a physician in the same
city, Dr John Elliot, to furnish them with poisonous drugs,
to be applied to her person. This purpose did not however
succeed; though it appears that Elliot had put the drugs
for that purpose into the hands of Maxwell. They therefore
changed their plan for an equally wicked, but far more
complicated, and more hazardous contrivance, <HI>viz.</HI> a con∣spiracy
to fix on Mrs Nicolson, and on Margaret Sands, her
sister, a design of poisoning Nicolson, her husband. In pur∣suance
of this, equally wild as flagitious compact, they pro∣ceeded
in the following manner. Nicolson waits on the
Lord Advocate, Sir James Stewart, and acquaints him, as
in great secrecy, that his life is in danger from the attempts
of his wife and her sister, who have conceived a ground∣less
suspicion of adultery between him and Marion Max∣well;
and he adds, that he has certain knowledge of the thing
from the information of Dr Elliot, to whom they had ap∣plied
for poison, and who, being filled with horror at such a
proposal, had come and revealed it to him and Maxwell.
This story he lays before the Advocate in such artful man∣ner,
as completely to deceive him; and he asks advice of
him how to proceed for his safety. The Lord Advocate
sends for Elliot, who confirms the whole particulars, and
adds that the two sisters seem immeasurably desirous to have
the poison: On the question being asked, he even ventures to
<PB N="248" REF="307"/>
say, that he believes they will not scruple to give a receipt
for the poison, specifying the use to which it is to be ap∣plied.
In consequence, he receives an instruction from
the Lord Advocate, to furnish the poison, and take such a
receipt from them if they will give it, and instantly to
bring it to him when obtained. In giving this direction,
the Lord Advocate's intention was to send and secure the
poison in the hands of Mrs Nicolson, and to provide evi∣dence
at the same time, of the mortal purpose for which she
had procured it. The conspirators intended secretly to
convey the drugs into Mrs Nicolson's repositories; so that
they might be found there upon search.</P>
<P>SOME farther intercourse relative to the terms of the re∣ceipt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Elliot and Nicolson.</NOTE>
took place with Elliot in the course of the succeeding
days. And the result was, that, in a short time, Elliot re∣turned
to the Lord Advocate, with a receipt for the poison,
under the hands of Jean and Margaret Sands, and in the terms
desired. In truth, this receipt was forged. Warrant however
immediately issues on it, to apprehend the two women. By
this means the charge becomes public; and in consequence
a fame arises, owing to the known evil character and scan∣dalous
conduct of Nicolson and Maxwell, that the whole
story is a lie, and a soul conspiracy of those adulterous para∣mours,
to destroy his lawful spouse. In short, one circum∣stance
transpiring after another, Elliot is alarmed and con∣fesses;
and the issue is, that all three are brought to the bar,
charged with the forgery and use of the receipt, the design
to poison, and the falsehood and conspiracy to fix that crime
upon Jean and Margaret Sands. Nicolson and Maxwell are
farther charged with the crime of notour adultery. Elliot
is found guilty of forging and using the false receipt, of the
<PB N="249" REF="308"/>
conspiracy against Jean and Margaret Sands, and of furnish∣ing
the poison; Nicolson and Maxwell are convicted of no∣tour
adultery, and of using the false receipt: And all three
have sentence of death; which is put in execution. It is
to be observed, that the conspiracy to fix the suspicion of an
intent to poison upon Jean and Margaret Sands, <HI>jointly</HI> with
the act of furnishing poison, with intent to destroy the for∣mer
of these persons, was found relevant to infer the pain of
death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the pannel's forging or using, or being art and part of forging or using the receipt of the poison libelled, relevant, <HI>per se,</HI> to infer the pains li∣belled; <HI>as also,</HI> find the pannel's giving poison to Marion Maxwell the other pannel at her desire, to be applied to the body of Jean Sands, spouse to Daniel Nicolson; <HI>with</HI> the endeavouring to fix a design upon the said Jean Sands and her sister, of poisoning the said Daniel Nicolson another of the pannels, rele∣vant to infer the pains libelled;” which were the pains of death.</NOTE>, independently of the forging or using of the receipt.</P>
<P>VII. THESE were instances of high and daring malice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of false As∣sumption of Character or Office.</NOTE>
which could hardly, in any civilised country, be supposed to
be beyond the reach of the common law. But it is the genius
of our practice equally to extend its attention to the inferior
offences of the same general class. Thus, on the 5th Fe∣bruary
1750, libel was sustained against George Craighead,
as well at common law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And farther, by the laws of this and other well governed realms, a per∣son taking upon him to act as a minister or clergyman, and as such celebrating a marriage, or signing an attestation or certificate thereof, under a false or as∣sumed name, especially when one of the parties so pretended to have been married, was formerly married to another spouse. Yet true it is,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> as upon certain statutes, for false∣ly
assuming the character of clergyman, to which he had
no pretension, and celebrating marriage, and giving certi∣ficates
thereof, under a false name. Indeed it is not to be
<PB N="250" REF="309"/>
doubted with respect to the false assumption of any official
character, for the purpose of breaking any point of public
discipline or order, that this scandalous imposture falls un∣der
the reprehension of the Magistrate, without, aid of any
statute directed against it.</P>
<P>THE same is even true of those offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Fraud or Swindling.</NOTE> of a pure pri∣vate
and patrimonial nature, which fall under the descrip∣tion
of what is known in England by the name of Swind∣ling,
and is committed by some false assumption of name,
character, commission, or errand, for the purpose of obtain∣ing
goods or money, or other valuable thing, to the offend∣er's
profit. With respect to tricks or frauds of this sort;
the more profitable market of England, and its more artificial
and punctilious system of law, have obliged our neighbours
to guard against them as they arise (in which shape the re∣medy
is always imperfect), by successive provisions of the
Legislature. But as these do not extend to, so neither are
they necessary in this country, where the common law takes
cognisance of, and competently punishes all such practices,
as frauds and falsehoods of a criminal nature.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention two late examples:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. and Aug. 1. 1786.</NOTE> the case of James
Grahame, and that of Thomas Hall; both of whom were
adjudged to be transported.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 12 Feb. 6. July 20. 21.</NOTE> The former had obtained mo∣ney
from several unsuspecting persons, under pretence of
having lately seen their relations abroad, and being the bearer
of presents to them from those relations, which, as he alleged,
were on board the vessel with him, and had put him to
charges in the payment of freight and the like; in support
of which fable he showed pretended bills of loading and
other vouchers. The libel was laid on a statute as well as at
common law, but was only sustained upon the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="310"/>
THE substance of the charge against Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRAUD AND CHEATING.</NOTE> was the ob∣taining
of goods from various dealers under the false pre∣tence
of setting up shop in Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> and having a trade
there to carry on. The man had indeed hired a shop, as
if with the view of trading; and the better to procure a far∣ther
credit, he had even paid in part for the goods which he
received. But in truth he was no trader, but a practised
cheat, and never meant to carry on traffic as a shopkeeper,
but to procure and run off with the goods; which in due
time he did, leaving the shop furnished with a show of
fictitious bales and empty boxes, to deceive for a time such
as might enquire about him. The case was thus distinguish∣ed
from the pure civil wrong of failure to pay for goods ob∣tained
on credit, in that the whole circumstances of the
story, the coming to Edinburgh, the hiring and opening
shop there, the assumed name of trader, and even any bu∣siness
done by him as such, were no more than the detail of
one original, false, and fraudulent purpose, to obtain and
run off with the goods, unpaid. The statute of the 30th
Geo. II. c. 24. on which also the libel had been laid, was
found not to extend to Scotland.</P>
<P>A PRIOR case of the like complexion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> and judged upon
the same grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 19. 1765.</NOTE> is that of Mathew Jack and Humphry
Ewing. These persons were dealers in tobacco, and were
in the use of exporting that commodity; on which occasion
they had drawback of the duties paid at importing. To
ascertain the amount of the drawback, the tobaccoes were
weighed in their presence, and that of the King's officers,
and with the King's weights; which were fixed to the balance
with a chain, secured with a padlock, of which the King's
officers kept the key. But this security the pannels had
<PB N="252" REF="311"/>
contrived to get the better of. They regularly, in the
night, before the weighing of their own tobacco, picked
the lock of the padlock, and detached certain of the King's
weights, and substituted an equal number of their own, con∣siderably
short of weight, but in appearance like the other.
With these their tobaccoes were weighed; and thus they
falsely and fraudulently gained the drawback on a greater
weight than they exported, to the extent, it appeared, of
28 lb. in a hogshead. After serving their purpose, the false
weights were again withdrawn in the night, and the King's
weights were replaced. These persons had sentence to be
scourged at the market-crosses of Glasgow and Greenock,
and to be drummed out of those towns.</P>
<P>ONE case more shall be stated in illustration of this salu∣tary
rule;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE>—The case of George Macfarlane, merchant in
Glasgow, who was tried there before Lord Royston, on the
10th of May 1733, at instance of William Alexander, mer∣chant
in Edinburgh. The libel bore, that having sold cer∣tain
hogsheads of tobacco to Michael and Thomas Wallace,
as agents for Alexander, and having in their presence mark∣ed
these hogsheads for him, he afterwards either transferred
the marks to other hogsheads of tobacco of inferior quality,
or took out the tobacco in the marked hogsheads, and
replaced it with other tobacco of an inferior kind, and by
this fraud and false device, cheated Alexander of his pro∣perty.
The Lords found it relevant to infer the pains of
law, “That the pannel by himself, or others by his war∣rant
and approbation, time and place libelled, fraudulent∣ly
defaced, erased or altered the marks put upon any of
the hogsheads mentioned in the libel, as chosen by Mi∣chael
and Thomas Wallace the pursuer's agents, and his
<PB N="253" REF="312"/>
having by himself, or others by his appointment, put on
the like marks on other hogsheads of tobacco, or changed
the tobacco in the said hogsheads so marked.”</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the principles of our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> it would be
no impeachment of these judgments, which are all of mo∣dern
date, that they were even the first of the kind, and
were pronounced upon offences of a new species, of which
no resemblance is to be found in our older practice. But
they have the authority of at least one judgment of an an∣cient
date; though perhaps the charge would have been also
relevant under the name of theft. In March 1634, James
Clerk, “brouster at the Wast-Port of Edinburgh,” was tried
upon a libel, whereof the 4th article charges him with the
<HI>cozenage</HI> of one James Moubray in Calder. It relates, that
Moubray had sent his servant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 18. &amp; 19. 1634.</NOTE> James Doig, with his sword,
worth L. 20, to one “Robert Moubray, sword-slippir, dwel∣land
outwith the Wast-Port of Edinburgh, to be dight and
dressit.” Doig neither knew the sword-slipper, nor had
ever been at his house. So, going along, with the sword in
his hand, he meets the pannel, also a stranger to him, of
whom he enquires the way to Moubray's house, and at the
same time tells him his errand. The pannel directs him to
go by the West-Port. Meanwhile, he hastens home by a
short way; disguises his person, by means of a cloak thrown
about him, and certain other contrivances; and getting
to the West-Port before Doig, he waits there for his co∣ming.
On his arrival, he again accosts him, and asks him
whom he seeks. “Robert Moubray sword-slipper,” answers
he. Then quoth Clerk, “<HI>I am the man.</HI>” And thus he gets
the sword, which he turns to his own uses. He is charg∣ed
as being withall “ane coosenar, trickir, fraudulent and
<PB N="254" REF="313"/>
false man, and abusir of honest persons, by fraudful and
dishonest meanis.”</P>
<P>THE pannel's plea to this charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> is entered in these
words: “As to the fourt article anent the pannell's alledgit
coosanadge, it is answerit by the pannell, his prolocutors,
that the samen is nawayis relevant to pass to the knaw∣ledge
of ane assize, being foundit upon nather law nor
practique; affirming that nae man can produce the like
caice, quh<SUP>r</SUP> the samyn was tryit at ony time be an assize.
And quh<SUP>r</SUP> it is lybellit, that the pannell is a common
coosenar, <HI>una hirundo non facit ver,</HI> and this is but <HI>casus sin∣gularis:</HI>
under protestatioun alwayis, that the pannell na∣wayis
grantis the samin.” The prosecutor answers in
substance, that the crime contained in the 4th article, is a
crime punishable of the law,—the <HI>crimen falsi,</HI> of which the
pannel is guilty by assuming the name of Robert Moubray,
and thereby deceiving Doig; but that he is content that the
pannel's punishment, if he be found guilty, shall be in <HI>arbi∣trio
judicis.</HI> “The Justice finds the said fourt article rele∣vant
to pass to the knawledge of ane assize, as ane crime
of the awin kynd, and in caise of convictione, the punisch∣ment
to be arbitrarie, excluding lyf and lym.” The man
was convicted, and remitted to the Privy Council for his
sentence; but what this was does not appear in the record.</P>
<P>WE have, however, in this century, some instances of
prosecution for a new species of fraud and falsehood, very
remote from any thing which the less fertile invention of our
ancestors had devised. One instance is the case of Maciver
and Macallum, tried before the Judge-Admiral in July 1784,
for a fraudulent combination to cheat the insurers of a cer∣tain
ship and cargo, by privately relanding part of the insured
<PB N="255" REF="314"/>
goods, and sinking the ship upon the voyage; for which pur∣pose
certain plug-holes bored in the bottom of the vessel
had actually been unstopped, so that the vessel was beginning
to fill, when it was captured by an enemy. In this way, the
discovery was made, and the ship saved from sinking; but the
pannels had proceeded to recover from the underwriters,
the full sums insured upon the ship and cargo. For this
complicated fraud and falsehood the Judge-Admiral con∣demned
them to pillory and banishment upon the ground
of common law; and this judgment, when brought under
review by suspension, the Court of Justiciary confirmed;
having expressly found<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the statutes of the 4th and 11th Geo. I. libelled on, do not ex∣tend to Scotland; but find that the libel, as laid upon the common law, was rightly found by the interlocutor of the Judge-Admiral relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and find that the verdict of the jury, as applied to that interlocutor, does warrant the judgment of the Judge-Admiral which passed upon it; and upon considering the atrocity and dangerous nature of the crime so charged and proved against the complainers, find that there is no just ground for mitigating that judgment; and repel the whole reasons of suspension, and refuse the bill.”</NOTE> that certain statutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1784.</NOTE> on which as
well as on the common law the libel had been laid, and which
the Admiral had disregarded as inapplicable to the case,
did not extend to Scotland at all.</P>
<P>THE like offence of making high insurance on a vessel,
and wilfully casting it away with intent to prejudice the
insurers, was by the Judge-Admiral found relevant to in∣fer
an arbitrary punishment at common law, in the case
of James Macnair, on the 14th March 1751; which seems
to have been our first trial of this sort. But a conviction
was not obtained. This article will be treated more at
large, under the head of crimes injurious to trade.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="315"/>
IT were vain to think of enumerating the many and va∣rious
forms of cheating or fraud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Use of false Weights and Measures.</NOTE> in which falsehood is one
of the chief ingredients of the guilt, and a cause of prose∣cution.
The instances which have been given may serve as
an illustration of the settled principle of our practice, and
as a ground of inference to other cases of the like cozenage
and circumvention. I shall therefore mention but one other
sort of falsehood, the easiest perhaps and most familiar of
any, and which accordingly has not been left to the pure
care of the common law: I mean that which is committed
by the use of false weights and measures, whereby the lieges,
and especially the mean and indigent, are cheated in their
daily and necessary traffic for the many commodities which
are disposed of in that way. This is acknowledged as a
point of dittay in the Leges Burg. c. 74. which place the
offender's life and limb in the King's will for the fourth of∣fence;
in the acts 1493, c. 47. and 1607, c. 2. the last of
which inflicts the pain of escheat of moveables, and the
other orders the transgressors to be punished as falsars; and
in the act 1661, c. 38. which commits the care of this mat∣ter
(formerly appertaining to the Chamberlain's department),
to the Justices of the Peace, and Magistrates of burghs, and
more especially to the Dean of Guild.</P>
<P>THESE things seem to be necessary for involving the accu∣sed
in the guilt of this offence. 1<HI>st,</HI> The deficiency of weight
or measure must be manifest and material, such as is injurious
to the customer, and cannot be supposed to pass unobserved
on the part of the user. Hence, verdict being returned against
Andrew Cochrane in a circuit Court at Ayr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 10. 1671.</NOTE> finding “the
said Andrew Cochrane, his weights proven light as to his
stone and quarter weight, but the quantity not proven what
they wanted, and his measures proven short, but not the
<PB N="257" REF="316"/>
quantity what they want;”<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALSE WEIGHTS, &amp;c.</NOTE> and this verdict being refer∣red
to the whole Court, “they fand the verdict of assize
both unclear and disconform to the dittay,” and therefore
assoilzied the pannel: for the deficiency might not be such
as to infer the pannel's wrong, <HI>2dly,</HI> The false weights
must have been used and given out for the true ones, (but
this may be done tacitly, and will be presumed against
the user), and the traffic have been carried on according∣ly.
3<HI>dly,</HI> They must be charged to be different from the
legal standard: for if the charge is only of a deviation
from the customary weight or measure of that neighbour∣hood
or district, (a thing for which there is no rule nor au∣thority),
this of itself, and without farther accusation of
some special device and dole, by which deception has been
occasioned, does not seem to be a relevant charge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1714.</NOTE> And so
it was found in the case of Sir James Dunbar and John For∣syth.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">August II. 1714. “Found the fourth article, <HI>viz.</HI> That Sir James used a half peck measure, for receiving the fractions of his rent from his tenants, dif∣ferent from the measure commonly used in that country; and likewise the fifth article, <HI>viz.</HI> That Forsyth used a half firlot for receiving his officer's corn or Yule bannock, different from the measure commonly used in that country, <HI>not</HI> relevant to infer a crime.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN strictness it is even a point of dittay (1503, c. 96.) to
make use of any weight or measure different from those
which national authority has established. And if this ap∣pointment
cannot every where be executed, by reason of the
long practice and known custom of certain counties or di∣stricts
to the contrary, it is not however to be imagined
that the law is therefore obsolete, nor that in other quarters
of the kingdom, or with respect to other commodities,
which have not been subject to any such irregularity, a li∣cence
<PB N="258" REF="317"/>
has been gained of dealing by various or arbitrary
weights or measures, such as are of no known proportion, and
are not reducible to any standard. For this loose practice is
against all equality or fairness of dealing, and is at variance
with our whole train of ordinances, as well as with the prac∣tice
of all the countries of Europe, and their interest in
traffic with each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE found but one conviction of this offence in the
books of adjournal. On the 30th July 1629, William
Brownlee, miller at Cairnbrue, was convicted of using a
measure, or fourth part of a peck, to receive his multure,
larger than that which he made use of in receiving the
corn to be grinded in his mill. But the assize at the same
time acquitted him of the making of this measure, which
he had found in the mill at his entry; and he was therefore
only condemned to pay a fine of 100 merks, and to find
caution to abstain from the use of the measure in time to
come.</P>
<P>IT is substantially the same offence with this, if a dealer
in any commodity, such as bread, which has a known
weight assigned it by public authority, shall make and ex∣pose
it of a lower weight. On this head there is the fol∣lowing
entry in the abridgment of the record in the Ad∣vocates
Library<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The record itself, from the end of 1539, to 19th April 1554, has pe∣rished.</NOTE>. “September 15. 1551. Thomas Craig

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF HOMICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to enter on that class of crimes which
are injurious to the person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. Of Homicide.</NOTE> and among these I shall
begin with that one, the highest of any, and of which na∣ture
has most abhorrence, the crime of homicide, by which
life is taken away, and the person of a human creature is de∣stroyed.
The order I shall observe in treating of this, equally
extensive as important part of our subject, will be, by first
enquiring concerning those things which are common to all
homicide, and afterwards proceeding to distinguish the se∣veral
degrees of homicide, one from another.</P>
<P>I. FIRST,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to mur∣der not capital.</NOTE> it is necessary to all conviction of homicide,
that a person have been actually killed. In this I mean to
say, that no attempt to kill will come under the description,
or expose to the proper pains of homicide, how deliberate
soever the purpose, or how cruel the means employed, and
how little soever it be owing to remorse or want of resolution
on the part of the assassin, that he has failed of success.
Nay, though the attempt have in a great measure succeeded,
and the party have received a wound which brings him to
<PB N="261" REF="320"/>
the brink of the grave, and leaves him infirm for the re∣mainder
of his life, still the benignity of our practice will
consider, that the man is not lost to society, and will allow
the offender an opportunity to repent, and to make atone∣ment
for his crime.</P>
<P>OF this, our well known rule, no stronger instance needs
be mentioned than the case of James Mitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 9. 1678.</NOTE> who, in
attempting to assassinate Sharpe, the Archbishop of St An∣drew's,
(for whom he had lain in wait to dispatch him with
a pistol, as he was stepping into his coach at the head of
Blackfriars-wynd, in the city of Edinburgh), inflicted a
severe and painful wound on the Bishop of Orkney, under
which he languished for years, and continued infirm and
ailing till the time of his death. Now, in the trial of
Mitchell for this offence, so far as the libel was laid at com∣mon
law, and not on a certain statute, by which it is capi∣tal
even to assault a privy counsellor on account of service
done the King, the charge was found only relevant to infer
an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And sicklike that article of the dittay, anent the invading, wounding and mutilating of the Bishop of Orkney, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment.”</NOTE>. Yet, that the shot did not take place
upon the person at whom it was aimed, could not have af∣fected
the judgment of the Court with respect to the pains
of law for such an attempt, if in itself it had been a capital
offence. A few years after, on occasion of the murder of
Sharpe, a statute was indeed made, the act 1681, c. 15.
which denounces the pains of treason not only against assas∣sins,
but against all who shall assert that it is lawful to kill up∣on
difference of opinion, or on account of service done to the
King, or to the established church. And from the latter part
of this enactment, occasion might have been taken to argue,
that for the higher offence of attempting to assassinate, or to
<PB N="262" REF="321"/>
kill <HI>per insidias et industriam,</HI> (for this with us seems to have
been the construction of that term), the offender could not
escape with a lighter pain. But this statute has been taken
away, in consequence of the general alteration of the Scot∣tish
system of treason law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>See the case of John Murray, 9th August 1703, where attempt to murder, laid to be done in the way of insidiating, and by firing with a gun, and thrusting with a sword, is found only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain.</P>
<P>On the 8th March 1756, John Ogilvy for stabbing a person with a knife, in the belly, and giving him a dangerous wound, was adjudged to be transported for life.</P>
<P>On the 8th July 1771, Thomas Young had the like sentence, on conviction of stabbing Henry Balnairs in the side, with a knife, as he lay asleep. The man's life was only saved by the knife striking a rib.</P>
<P>They have a statute in England by which it is a capital crime to shoot at a person with intent to kill. But it does not extend to this country.</P>.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE only controversy on this head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to poi∣son, if capital.</NOTE> of which it is worth
while to take particular notice, relates to the case of an at∣tempt
to poison; in regard to which, Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">B. 1. tit. 8. No. 5. and 6.</NOTE> hath said
that it may be punished with death; at least in aggravated
cases, as when directed against a parent, a magistrate, or a
matter. But the statutes 1450, c. 31. and 32. upon which
chiefly this opinion is grounded, have no relation to the
users, but only to the homebringers of poison; besides, that
even in the matter to which they properly related, the rigour
of those laws does not appear to have been in any instance
applied. It is true, respecting the attempt to poison a pa∣rent,
that this opinion may farther be strengthened by the
example of the Roman practice, which seems to have punished
the child with death, who bought poison with the purpose of
<PB N="263" REF="322"/>
administering it to the father, <HI>quamvis non potuerit dare.</HI>
But notwithstanding the extreme depravity of such a pur∣pose,
it does not seem to be certain, that upon this single
authority, which is borrowed from a state of manners, and
of domestic discipline, very different from ours, we shall be
disposed to judge in this instance, contrary to the general
analogy of our law. Upon the ordinary and less atrocious
case, two judgments have been given. In the noted trial of
Dr Elliot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15. 1694.</NOTE> an attempt to poison was found relevant to infer
the pains of death, but only in conjunction with a most malig∣nant
conspiracy to fix the guilt of that crime upon two inno∣cent
persons<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As also, find the pannells giveing poyson to Marion Maxwell the other pannell, at her desire, to be applyed to the body of Jean Sands, spouse to Da∣niel Niccolson, <HI>with</HI> the endeavouring to fix a <HI>design</HI> upon the said Jean Sands and her sister of poysioning the said Daniel Niccolson, another of the pannells, relevant to infer the pains labelled.”</NOTE>. And in the later case of Walter Buchannan
of Balquhan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15. 1728.</NOTE> who was charged with two attempts to poi∣son
Jean Dougal, liferenter of part of his estate, this article,
<HI>per se,</HI> was found only relevant to infer an arbitray pain<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">And further, the said Lords find “That the said Walter Buchannan ha∣ving, at either of the times libelled, attempted to poison the said <HI>Jean Dougal,</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEXT;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Person must die of the harm li∣belled.</NOTE> it must be shown that the person died of the harm
or mischief libelled; of that whereof the pannel was actor,
or art and part. For though a person be severely wounded,
yet if he recover of the injury so as to come abroad, and
engage in his ordinary occupations, there is no reason why
his death following afterwards, which in these circumstan∣ces
must be presumed to be from some other cause, should
be the ground of a charge of murder. Judgment was gi∣ven
to that purpose in the case of Patrick Kinninmonth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE> up∣on
<PB N="264" REF="323"/>
on that article of the libel, which relates to the slaughter
of Andrew Glassford.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And finds the defence of Glassford's liveing two moneths and upwards af∣ter receiving the wound and going abroad about his business, relevant to re∣strict the indytment as to that article to ane arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But even cases of a far more delicate nature must be de∣cided
in the same way. In a combat between John and
James, John receives a wound of that sort which either
may or may not prove mortal, and James flies for his safe∣ty,
and leaves John upon the field, to the care of his own
friend. If in these circumstances they are surprised by
ruffians, who strip and rob John, and beat out his brains;
no charge of homicide will on that account lie against
James, whose act has indeed given occasion to the catas∣trophe,
but is not the act by which John has been killed.
Or again: a person of a weakly habit receives a wound, of
which, after some space of time he is cured; but owing to
the pain and confinement, he is taken ill of a consumption
or other malady incident to a state of weakness; and of
this he dies. It may be very true, that the author of this
calamity has great cause of compunction and distress of
mind; but it is only in that sort of suffering that his punish∣ment
in this world must lie. Inferences of this kind are
by far too remote, and too uncertain, to be made the grounds
of judgment in human tribunals; and as even in the civil
question of deathbed, those ailments would on that account
be held to be distinct, much more must the same rule be
followed in the trial of a person for his life.</P>
<P>IN the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Person must die of the harm libelled.</NOTE> accordingly, of James Mitchell already men∣tioned,
though the libel relates that the Bishop of Orkney
“did never recover his health to that measure and vigour
<PB N="265" REF="324"/>
that he had or might have had, if he had not gotten the
said wound, and he was mutilate and dismembered of his
arm and hand, so that he could make no use of the samin,
but languished thereof until he died;” yet all this is not
found relevant to infer the pains of death; nor indeed is
it even charged as homicide in the libel.</P>
<P>MUCH the same case it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death <HI>ex malo regimine.</HI></NOTE> if a person receive some slight
injury, in itself nowise dangerous nor difficult to be cured,
but which by the great obstinacy and intemperance of the pa∣tient,
or by rash and hurtful applications, degenerates in the
end into a mortal sore; for the man here has killed himself,
and the first injury is nothing more than the occasion of
his deed. A defence of this sort was remitted to the assize,
along with the libel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 13. 1674.</NOTE> in the case of William Mason; where
it was alleged for the pannel, that by refusal of proper reme∣dies,
and by persisting to keep abroad in the night, and in
severe weather, the deceased had irritated a slight cut in
the head into a mortal complaint<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds the lybel as it is lybelled relevant only to infer <HI>poenam extraordina∣riam,</HI> and remitts the same to the knowledge of an assise; and also remitts the defences proponed for the pannell, <HI>viz.</HI> that of casual homicide, self-defence, and that the wound was not of itself mortal, likeways to the knowledge of an assise.”</NOTE>. In the older case of
Thomas Crombie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1625.</NOTE> on the pannel's allegation that the de∣ceased
had <HI>misgoverned</HI> himself, (as it is called), by hard
drinking, bearing company, and dancing at a bridal, con∣trary
to the advice of his surgeon, the complainer judged it
prudent to depart from his prosecution.</P>
<P>ANOTHER set of cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the Death must be certain.</NOTE> upon which the like judgment
must be passed, are those in which the violence sustained
<PB N="266" REF="325"/>
from the pannel is only one circumstance among others which
have contributed to the fatal issue, and is such whereof it can∣not
be well ascertained, what its own proper operation in the
case has been. There are for instance many situations of dis∣ease,
in which any sudden disturbance and alarm, or a cup of
cold water, or a glass of spirits improperly administered, may
produce a great and unfavourable change in the state of the
patient; who in the end dies. Yet even on the supposition that
the thing is wickedly done, it will still be very difficult to
convict the offender of murder; because the disease itself is
here the main and primary cause, and it cannot be shown
with that certainty of which the law is desirous in such
enquiries, that it has only proved mortal, owing to this ad∣ventitious
circumstance. Thus William Duff of Braco and
others were indicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 10. &amp; 17. 1707.</NOTE> at the instance of James Gordon, upon
a libel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The major proposition has these words: “To invade them by open force in their own houses; and farder, with full terror, threats, drawn swords, and outrageous violence, as occasion the disordering and frightening of persons out of their lives, and death visibly ensuing, are crimes of a high nature, and ought to be severely punished; the said in law being chargeable on the principal con∣vocator and invaders, as <HI>praebentes causam mortis, i. e.</HI> The fright whereof the person fevered and died.”</NOTE> which sets forth that they had broken into his house,
by way of haimesucken, to beat him, and that his wife being in
childbed at the time, “she▪ by reason of the terror of the roar∣ing
and raging of the armed men about her,” was thrown
into a fever of which she died: it therefore concludes for
a capital pain to be inflicted upon the pannels, as those who
“by cruelly affrighting the poor woman, even out of her
life, <HI>mortis causam tribuerunt.</HI>” Now the Court dismissed
this libel as irrelevant. In like manner, among other
charges in the case of Patrick Kinninmonth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1697.</NOTE> is that of
<PB N="267" REF="326"/>
breaking into a person's house and frightening his wife, who
had been delivered three days before, so that the child died
soon after, upon her breast, and to the great injury of her
own health. The interlocutor sustains the injury done the
woman as a ground of arbitrary pain; but it takes no no∣tice
of the death of the child<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As to the 4th article of the indictment anent the pannel and his accom∣plices entering Robertson's house, under cloud of night with drawn swords, the frightening Robertson's wife, and wounding of her and her daughter, find the same relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE things have been received in favour of the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Per∣son killed was on Deathbed.</NOTE>
to avoid the possibility of doing him injustice. But it is no
less requisite to the due prosecution of the guilty, that this
rule be also circumscribed on the other side, and that no ex∣ception
be admitted of any situation, where the death of the
deceased is the plain and direct consequence of that which
is done to him by the pannel, whatsoever in other respects
be the circumstances of the case. There are two descrip∣tions
of charge, which fall under this rule of judgment.
One consists of those cases, where it may be argued, that
the deceased was at any rate in a dying condition, and, ac∣cording
to the course of nature, had but a short time to live.
And there can be no doubt, that the slayer has not in that
circumstance any manner of defence. If a person who is
old and bed-rid, or in the last stage of a mortal disease,
shall be stabbed with a lethal weapon, or knocked in the
head with a stake, this is equally murder as to destroy in
the same manner one who is in the vigour of years and
health. Upon the issue of diseases, it belongs to none
but unto God to determine; and granting that a certain
judgment could even be formed concerning the event, still
<PB N="268" REF="327"/>
it is true, (and therefore the charge of homicide must
be good), that the pannel hath actually taken his neigh∣bour's
life; a deed in which there is no difference of de∣gree
from the amount of the harm which is thereby done,
but only from the motive which impels to it. Upon this
matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. &amp; 24. 1713.</NOTE> the case of Jean Ramsay is an authority in point.
The libel relates, that Robert Ramsay, a sickly and infirm
person, being found lying upon the street of Leith, was chari∣tably
carried from thence into the pannel's house, and laid
upon a bed; from which the pannel, on coming home, vio∣lently
dragged him, and beat him with a pair of tongs; and
that she repeated this usage when he was laid upon the bed a
second time; whereby, in a few hours he died. This was
found a relevant charge to infer the crime of murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the pannel's violently dragging the defunct Robert Ram∣say, a weak and infirm person, out of the bed on which he was laid, so that his head was bled on the bed-stock or floor, and her beating of him on the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de with a pair of tongs, and her <HI>again</HI> dragging him out of another bed, whereon he was afterwards laid, and his dying within a few hours thereafter, about the time libelled, <HI>jointly,</HI> relevant to infer the pains of death, and consiscation of all her moveable goods and gear; and find any of the foresaid facts, separately, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>;
though it was argued for the pannel, that the event was ra∣ther
to be ascribed to the previous condition of the man. She
was not, however, convicted of the violence, in the extent
which the interlocutor required; and therefore she escaped
with sentence of banishment and scourging.</P>
<P>THE other class of cases are such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Wound might have been cu∣red?</NOTE> concerning which it
may be argued or conjectured, that in more favourable cir∣cumstances
than those in which the violence was offered, the
injury might not have had a mortal issue. And in gene∣ral
it seems to be true, that as little can there be any al∣lowance
<PB N="269" REF="328"/>
of this sort of plea. If an assault is made with a
knife, or other cutting weapon, whereby some artery or
blood-vessel is divided, and the person bleeds to death upon
the spot; it is no answer to the charge of homicide, that of
itself the wound was not necessarily mortal, and that with
the instant assistance of a surgeon, if he could have been
procured, the effusion of blood might have been stopped,
and the man's life preserved. Or put the case, that a sur∣geon
is procured, who staunches the blood for the time, but
that after his departure the wound breaks out a-fresh, and
the man dies before assistance can again be had; this inci∣dent
also is at the hazard of the pannel. Or what if a per∣son
receive a gunshot-wound at some remote place in the
country, where no surgeon skilled in the treatment of such
wounds is to be had, and of which wound he dies, notwith∣standing
the best care of the practitioners in that quarter.
Or let us imagine that a person is robbed, and unmercifully
beaten under night, in severe weather, and in a solitary
place, so that lying exposed to the cold throughout the
night, he dies upon the spot, or of the consequences shortly
after. In all these, and the like cases, there is an undoubt∣ed
homicide. It is still true, that of this very injury, done
him by the pannel, the person dies. It has had its natural
course and issue, in the circumstances of the situation, such
as they happened to be where the pannel did the deed, and
which the party suffering has done nothing to aggravate,
and every thing in his power to relieve. If these have been
unfavourable, this he must answer and run the risk of, whose
malicious deed, then and there done, has made them of mo∣ment
to the loss or preservation of the life of a fellow
creature. Besides, the uncertainty must be considered,
which always hangs about such cases of great and outrage∣ous
<PB N="270" REF="329"/>
injury, whether by any course of treatment, the life of
the person could have been saved. The actual destruction
of him by this violence is proved; and that he would have
survived in more favourable circumstances, is matter of
conjecture only, or of probability at the best.</P>
<P>ONE case which serves in some measure to illustrate this
rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Wound might have been cured. June 30. and July 6. 1747.</NOTE> is that of David Edgar, tried for the murder of Wil∣liam
Paisley, officer of excise. Edgar was one of a party
of smugglers, who had fired at Paisley in the exercise of his
duty, and wounded him with small shot or slugs, in the leg
or knee. The man was attended by a surgeon, the best
that could be had in the village whither he was carried,
and who was not alleged to have been deficient in atten∣tion:
nevertheless a great collection of matter having form∣ed
in the leg, below the wound, and fever having ensued;
at the end of three weeks the man died. Now this, it was
objected for the pannel, was not a relevant charge of mur∣der:
In as much as the wound (it was said) was of that na∣ture,
and in such a place, that with skilful treatment it might
have been cured, and could not justly be supposed to be the
cause of the person's death, especially at such a distance
of time. It was answered, that the pannel might prove,
if he could, that death ensued <HI>ex malo regimine,</HI> and not
from the nature of the wound; but that otherwise his plea
was naught, if the proof upon the prosecutor's part should
come up to the showing of his libel. The Court found the
libel relevant to infer the pains of law. But the proof was
not conclusive against the pannel, as the person who in∣flicted
the wound; and he had therefore a verdict in his
favour.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="330"/>
THIS case gives occasion farther to remark, that though
death do not ensue for weeks or months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Death at a Distance of Time;</NOTE> yet if the wound
be of itself severe, and keep in a regular progression from
worse to worse, so that the patient continually languishes
thereof, and is plainly consumed by it as a disease; this
in reason, and in law, is all one as if he died upon the
spot. A plea to the contrary was repelled in the case of Ed∣ward
and James Scrymgeour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 27. 1618. and Jan. 15. 1619. July 30. 1630.</NOTE> where the deceased had been
wounded in September, and survived till the succeeding Ja∣nuary<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Justice repells the haill allegations in respect of the dittay and an∣swers made by my Lord Advocate in fortification thereof, and ordains the dittay, which is found relevant, to pass to the knowledge of ane assize.”</NOTE>.
As it also was in the case of John Young, indicted
for slaughter, by striking a person “with a whinger on the
shakell-bane” in the month of June; of which wound
he died in October. Again, in the case of William Lowis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18. 1610.</NOTE>
where it appeared from the libel that the person had lived
for seventeen months after the injury, the charge was
nevertheless sent to an assize<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Justice remits this matter to the assize, to be tried and cognosced by them according to their knowledge and conscience.” The assize acquitted the pannel.</NOTE>, along with the defence,
that he had reconvalesced and appeared at kirk and mar∣ket.
Witness also the pointed interlocutor in the case of
Peter Leith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1686.</NOTE> who was accused of wounding the deceased
with shot or small slugs, in the arm or shoulder, whereof he
died at the distance of three months. This the Court “find
relevant in thir terms, <HI>viz.</HI> that after the defunct re∣ceived
the wound he languished thereof constantly from
evil to worse, till he died of the same; and find that the
defunct died of the wounds relevant to be proven by
<PB N="272" REF="331"/>
physicians and skilful surgeons only.” Add to these
the case of John Caldwall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. June, July 1737.</NOTE> who had robbed the mail, and
with some sharp instrument violently cut and abused the
post-boy. The lad lay on the ground all night, and suffered
severely by the cold, the loss of blood, and the pain of
his wounds, so that thenceforward he was feverish and
hectic, and growing daily worse, died at the end of two
months. The Court found a relevancy on the charge of
murder as well as robbery.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 28. 1737. “The Lords find, that the pannel having, time and place libelled, seized the mail or packet coming from Glasgow, or that he robbed the same, or robbed James Johnston the post-boy of all or any of the particulars respectively libelled, or that the pannel did give a mortal wound to the said James Johnston, whereof he afterwards died, or that the pannel was art and part of any of the foresaid crimes, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death and confiscation of moveables.”</NOTE>. It was given in evidence by
a surgeon, that the boy had received a deep wound in the
thigh, “and that the above wound, with the cold that the
defunct got by lying out all that night he received it, and
the great loss of blood that followed on it, was the cause
of his death.” The jury found him guilty of the <HI>crimes</HI> li∣belled;
and he was condemned and executed accordingly<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the case of David Pretis, who was convicted of murder, by wounding with a knife, the surgeon swore, that for three days the man seemed in a way of recovery, but then fevered, owing to the wound, and died. January 19. and February 2. 1730.</NOTE>.
This, upon the whole, was not very remote from the case of
William Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 24. 1669.</NOTE> taken notice of by Mackenzie, where,
according to the evidence of the surgeon, the deceased “had
ane wound in her forehead, and that the wound of its own
nature was not mortal, but that the fractious contusions
and ruptures, joined with the wound, could not be cured,
and that he used his art for mending of it; that the
<PB N="273" REF="332"/>
wounds joined with the fractions was mortal and uncure∣able,
<HI>and brought ane symptomatical fever on her,</HI> which con∣tinued
to the time of her death.” The hardship in this
case, and which in the end procured a pardon for the pannel,
was in the refusal of the evidence offered on his part, to
show that the fever was contracted at a distance of time, and
from another cause<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I shall here observe, that though such has always been anciently the course of judgment, yet nothing was more common in criminal pleadings than ar∣guments of a very different complexion; in so much, that I again and again find it objected to a libel, that it did not characterise the wound as <HI>mortal,</HI> although it related and set forth that of this wound the deceased died. Thus, in William Davidson's case, (12th July 1726), the pannel argues, “It is not enough to say that Hutchinson <HI>died</HI> of the wound, for every wound after which death may, or even did follow, is not to be esteemed a mortal wound. The essence of which consists in this, that a man <HI>cannot</HI> receive it, and at the same time have the <HI>possibility</HI> of living.” Again in William Cob's case, 1st February 1720,— “The giving of a wound, if it is not a mortal wound, though a person should <HI>chance to die thereof,</HI> the crime of murder will not be inferred;” and with this plea the information is chiefly occupied. In this the lawyers were taking advantage of the arrangements of books of surgery; where wounds are found <HI>classed</HI> into such as are, or are not, mortal; and they endeavoured from thence to argue, that wherever a person died of a wound, not belonging to the mortal class, it must have been <HI>ex malo regimine,</HI> or through misconduct. We find, in like manner, that in the case of Sir John Shaw, 20th February 1716, upon an indictment for assaulting and wounding, three physicians and two surgeons swear, that “by the rules of their prognostick,” the wounds received by James Houston were mortal. Now Houston was alive, and pursuer in the very process where these gentlemen deponed to this effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOW right soever these judgments upon the cases in which
they were given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is there a limit∣ed period in that article.</NOTE> it may however be alleged, that there
ought to be some rule of limitation in this matter, (such as
they are said to have in England to the space of a twelve-month)
grounded on the circumstance of the period at
which the death takes place: Because where the illness is
<PB N="274" REF="333"/>
of very long duration, it is difficult to trace the influ∣ence
of the original injury, and its connection with the final
issue, in that clear and palpable manner, which is to be
wished in the investigation of crimes. But with us, so far
as I can learn, (nor have I observed that this course has
ever been attended with injustice), that circumstance has
not been considered any otherwise than as one among
others, in the sum of evidence upon the case. It is true,
that in the trial already mentioned of Patrick Kinninmonth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE>
where certain injuries done to the person of Walter Ander∣son
are charged as the cause of his death, which took place
at the distance of more than fourteen months, the libel, as
to this article, is found only relevant to infer an arbitrary
pain. But this, as far as I can judge, was rather on account
of the nature of the injuries themselves, which, as related in
the libel, are more of the description of indignities, less in∣tended
to injure, than to vilify and degrade.</P>
<P>THIRDLY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of a Child <HI>in utero.</HI></NOTE> The slaughter must be of a person, or existing
human creature. Wherein is excluded all procuring of
abortion, or destruction of future birth, whether quick or
not; because, though it be quick, still it is only <HI>pars visce∣rum
matris,</HI> and not a separate being, or such of which it can
with certainty be said, whether it would have become a
quick <HI>birth</HI> or not. It is no doubt true, that on the 10th
November 1606, Patrick Deanes had sentence of death for
the slaughter of his wife and a child in her womb. As also,
on the 12th February 1631, Thomas Davidson and Effie
Gibb had the like sentence, for the murder of Elizabeth
White, Davidson's wife, “and the bairn in her belly being
near to the full time.” And again there is the case of
Patrick Robertson and Marion Kempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. 1627.</NOTE> for notour adultery
<PB N="275" REF="334"/>
and the administering and taking of <HI>a poisonable draught,</HI> (as
the record calls it), wherewith she destroyed her child in
the womb. But in all these instances, another and a capital
crime concurred with the destruction of the child; and it
cannot be known from the short and general expressions of
the record, that the latter was found relevant as a murder by
itself: Neither have I found any instance of that description
in later times. One case is indeed stated in some of the
English books, upon which there may be room for argument
against the prisoner; the case of a child which is born alive,
but dies immediately upon the birth, in consequence of evil
medicines, which have previously been administered to the
mother<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 16.</NOTE>. But it is difficult to imagine, (and no more needs
be said on the case), that in these circumstances a decisive
proof shall ever be obtained of the true cause of the death
of the child.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be decided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All one what the person kill∣ed is.</NOTE> (if the occasion shall ever
happen), it is certain that no distinction is taken in regard to
the creature killed, from any circumstance which may be
thought to lessen the value or importance of the life that has
been taken away. There is the same law for it, whether the
deceased was of found intellects or insane, a native subject or
an alien, a Christian, a Jew, or an infidel, a true man or a
known criminal, one at peace with the church or an ex-communicated
person. With respect however to one class
of persons, namely, persons who have been proclaimed re∣bels,
(or denounced at the horn, as it is called), for criminal
causes, this has only become our law in later times. For it
appears, that according to the more severe notions of our
<PB N="276" REF="335"/>
older jurisprudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaughter of one at the Horn.</NOTE> no process could be maintained for the
slaughter of a person in that condition; not by the King,
who had not lost a subject, or person at his peace and faith,
and as little by the relations of the deceased, who by sundry
statutes were forbidden to harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540, c. 97. 1592, c. 146.</NOTE> comfort, or have inter∣course
with him, under pain of death, or at least under the
like pain to which the rebel himself would be subject on
conviction. Strange as it seems to us, this defence was ex∣plicitly
sustained in the case of Thomas Cranstoun of Mo∣riestoun,
and others, tried on the 17th June 1606, for the
slaughter of William Broomfield, who was at the horn for
houghing of oxen. The proceedings are entered in the re∣cord
as follows. “It is allegit for the pannell, that this

the pannell askit instruments. <HI>The pannell</HI> protestes,
that the using of this horning prejudge thaim nocht of
the rest of their lawful defenses.”</P>
<P>THE same decision was substantially given in the case of
Johnston against Graham;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaughter of one at the Horn.</NOTE> where the Justice on considering
the defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. 1605.</NOTE> and certain objections stated to the horning in
reply, “remitts the decision of the nullity or validity of
the horning to the Lords of Session, <HI>and giff the horning be
<PB N="277" REF="336"/>
null by the Lords,</HI> ordains the pannell now to find caution
to enter before the Justices upon fifteen days warning,
to abide a trial for the said slaughter.” In the case too
of Hector Turnbull and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. &amp; 19. 1601.</NOTE> the prosecutor does not dis∣pute
the relevancy of the defence, but replies on certain nul∣lities
in the horning, and on a lawful relaxation from it;
which last reply is sustained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The precise same reply occurs in the case of Hector Bannatyne, 24th July 1600; but on this no judgment was given.</NOTE>, and one of the pannels is con∣victed.
Neither does it seem to be certain, what Mackenzie
says on authority of the judgment in the case of Robert
Achmooty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 5. &amp; 9. 1600.</NOTE> that this licence did not excuse the slaughter if
committed on a private quarrel, or from motives of revenge.
It rather appears that the reasons of the practice were inde∣pendent
of any such consideration; and indeed in that
trial other defences were far more strenuously urged, and
chiefly this, that the horning was already reduced and set
aside by decree of the civil Court<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Besides, the King had directed two several warrants to the Court, ordering them to proceed in the trial without delay, and refusing, before hand, to receive the pannel into will, if he should make any tender to that effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NAY more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaughter of one at the Horn for a civil cause.</NOTE> and which serves to confirm these prece∣dents,
the like plea had even been set up in cases of horn∣ing
for civil and pecuniary causes; as is plain from a
debate at large upon that matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1611.</NOTE> in the case of William
Douglas of Drumlanrige, who being indicted for the ta∣king
and imprisoning of a free liege, defends himself on
this ground, that as such a one may lawfully be killed,
much more may he be imprisoned. It appears that this
pretension, which was not so void of support in specious
arguments of law, as in reason and in substantial justice,
<PB N="278" REF="337"/>
had given occasion to some alarm concerning the exten∣sive
consequences into which such a doctrine would have
led: at least this may be conjectured from a letter of the
King's, (recorded on the 24th April 1612), which absolves
the pannel from the prosecution, on condition that he re∣nounce
his said defences, and consent to their being ex∣punged
from the record; “insisting in the meane time ear∣nestly,
that thouse uthir exceptiones heretofoir usit in his
defence being so dangerous, and by no presedent warranded,
may not heiraftir be recordit in the registeris of adjournall
as lauchful or tolirable defences, to be proponit in the like
caiss in ony tyme cuming.” It was not however thought pro∣per
to trust to this security: for truly the principle went alike
to both cases; the person being equally a rebel to the royal
will, whether he disobeyed a civil or criminal process. In the
same year a statute was therefore made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612, c. 3.</NOTE> which cut short this
controversy, and declared, that in cases of slaughter or muti∣lation
no such defence should be admitted. In the end, this
barbarous and extravagant doctrine was retrenched to the
due bounds, by the statute 1661, c. 22. which only permits
the slaughter of declared rebels for capital crimes, and only
when done in pursuit of them to the ends of justice, and up∣on
their forcible opposition. Indeed it would be a strange
condition of the law, if a private and unauthorised indivi∣dual
could with impunity, and on his private quarrel, kill a
person against whom there is no conviction on record, and
yet the magistrate be guilty of murder, who varies from his
warrant in the execution of the sentence of death.</P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing; the se∣veral ways of it.</NOTE> as to the way of killing; this general and
necessary limitation must be acknowledged, that the manner
of the death be such, wherein the act of the pannel plainly
<PB N="279" REF="338"/>
and palpably, and not by suspicion and conjecture only, ap∣pears.
It may be true, that in adhering to this rule, we shall
leave unpunished those many modes of unkindness, ingrati∣tude,
treachery, and oppression, by which, in too many cases,
the heart as well as health is broken, and the sufferer con∣ducted
to the grave, by a longer and more painful passage.
But the reasons are obvious, why these transgressions, how
deep soever, cannot be vindicated in the tribunals of this
world.</P>
<P>OTHER than this unavoidable restriction, there seems to be
none with respect to the way in which the person is destroyed.
It is equally a homicide, whether the deed be done by the
very hand of the pannel, as in shooting or stabbing, or by
his exposing the deceased to the operation of some destructive
power; as by confining him to a dungeon without food, or by
setting fire to the house where he is asleep, or by fastening
him to a rock in the sea, and leaving him there, to be drown∣ed
by the flood<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This illustration was suggested by the narrative of the libel in the case of Neilson and others, (16th June 1620), which bears, that they bound the deceased hand and foot, and carried him in a boat “to the Craig of Class<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esse, where ha∣ving left him, the sea overflowed the said Craig, and so he was <HI>pitifully drown∣ed and carried away to the main-ocean-sea.</HI>” This libel was not prosecuted to a trial.</NOTE>. Another illustration of this more indirect,
but not less cruel sort of homicide, is in the case of a new
born child or infant, if it be cast out into the fields, in the
night, in a solitary place, and in rigorous weather, there to
be consumed with cold and want of food;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of In∣fants by ex∣polure.</NOTE> for this treatment
not only shows an utter indifference about the fate of the
child, but is a deliberate selection of the very circumstances
that are fitted to extinguish life. A charge of this kind
was found relevant in the case of Helen Wilson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16. 1722.</NOTE> who is sta∣ted
<PB N="280" REF="339"/>
to have left her child, of fifteen months old, naked, or
slenderly clothed, in the night, upon a rock in the sea, called
Lammer Island, where it was next morning found dead<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">23d July 1722. The Lords “find, that the pannel having, the time and place libelled, thrown down John Bruce her child from a rock, where he was found dead next morning; <HI>or</HI> her leaving and exposing her said child upon the rocks in the night time, where he was found dead next morning; <HI>or</HI> her ha∣ving the time libelled carried out her said child under cloud of night, and returned soon thereafter without the child, and giving false and various ac∣counts about the child to those who enquired after him, and the child next morning being found dead upon the rocks, all three of the alternatives, <HI>se∣peratim,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of moveables.”</NOTE>.
A similar charge had been made in the older case of Marga∣ret
Smith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 10. 1679.</NOTE> Margaret Henryson, and Catharine Scott, two of
whom were convicted, and hanged. These women, on the
birth of the child, which was in the night, and in severe
weather<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And so cruel and unnatural were all the said persons, that though the child was a living and a strong child, yet they took no care thereof, but left the samen naked and undressed, crawling upon the floor of the said Margaret Smith's house, in a cold and frosty night, by the space of three hours, and thereafter carried the said infant to the south side of the Cannongate, and left the samen in the furre of a ridge upon the snow, because they could not get it buried, the frost being hard.”</NOTE>, had laid it upon the stone-floor of the apartment,
where having lain for three hours, naked and unassisted, it
perished in their presence. There is also an instance of re∣levancy
found upon the exposure of a person of riper years.
Elizabeth Key was indicted for the murder of Agnes Stew∣art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 20. and April. 10. 1699.</NOTE>
her apprentice, a girl of eleven or twelve years of age,
by carrying her out under cloud of night, when sick and
ailing, and exposing her in the open air; whereby she died
through cold and hunger. This was found relevant to infer
the pains of death, though the exposure was in a public street
<PB N="281" REF="340"/>
of a considerable town<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the indytment, as lybelled, relevant to infer the pain of death against the pannel; and also find, that if she carried out the child, after she was dead, as is lybelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” On∣ly the last part of the interlocutor was found proved; and the pannel was set up∣on the Tron, and banished Scotland.</NOTE>. One can imagine other situations,
though not so likely to happen, in which the same judgment
shall be due. If a goaler shall deliberately consine a prison∣er
in the same cell with an outrageous madman who is un∣bound,
or with a person who is dying of some known ma∣lignant
and contagious disease, or shall wilfully thrust him
into a lothsome and pestilential dungeon, where he sickens,
and shall refuse to remove him thence, though he observe the
dying condition of the man; all these acts are in law, equal∣ly
as in conscience, proper instances of the guilt of murder.
One situation more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Evidence on a capital Trial.</NOTE> which may seem to have a near affinity
to these, and which in the Roman practice was classed along
with them<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Dig. Lib. 48. tit. 8. t. 1. No. 1.</NOTE>, is that of the person who bears false witness
in the trial of another for his life; if in consequence the
accused be condemned and suffer death. That the guilt of
such a conspiracy is equal to that of murder, and truly far
exceeds the ordinary instances of it, in as much as it is an
act of deeper contrivance, and more deliberate and conti∣nued
malice, will not admit of question; and cases may
easily be imagined where the dependence of the conviction
on the particular testimony of the pannel shall be suffi∣ciently
plain, to set him down as the undoubted author of
the death of his fellow creature. Also, all uncertainty of
this inference may be avoided, by using the jury on the for∣mer
trial as witnesses; who, if they concur in swearing that by
the pannel's testimony they were chiefly influenced to con∣demn,
<PB N="282" REF="341"/>
and that but for this they would have acquitted, seem
to furnish all that is needful, to make up the due measure to∣wards
his conviction. I have not however found any autho∣rity,
which introduces this construction into the Scottish
practice; and perhaps there are considerations, of expediency
at least, upon the other side, to outweigh these reasons in the
natural malignity of the act<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Conviction of murder was obtained upon such a ground, in England, in the case of Macdaniel and others, in January 1754. But on motion in arrest of judg∣ment, sentence was delayed in order that the law might be more fully considered. In the end, the Attorney-General declined to argue the question; and the men were in consequence discharged. Foster (p. 131. 132.) seems to think that the conviction was not right. Blackstone (b. 4. p. 196.) says that the prosecution was only dropped for prudential reasons. See Leach's Cases, No. 18.</NOTE>. Besides; as Montesquieu
has justly observed<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Esprit des Loix, liv. 29. c. 11.</NOTE>, there is less need of a capital pain
applied to this offence, in those systems of law, which, like
that of Scotland, furnish innocence with so many resources,
and are open to the admission of all manner of proof on
the part of the pannel, equally as on that of the accuser.</P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide; its serval kinds.</NOTE> HITHERTO, of the common qualities, wherein all ho∣micide
agrees. Next of the several degrees of homicide;
which seem to be principally four; though perhaps not ful∣ly
distinguished in our practice by appropriated names.
There is one sort of homicide, which is free of all blame,
and does not expose to any manner of pain. Another sort
of homicide cannot indeed be capitally punished, yet being
in some degree blameable, is subject to censure, greater or
less, according to the measure of the fault. The third sort
of homicide is murder, and is punished with death. In the
fourth division are comprised those cases of aggravated mur∣der,
<PB N="283" REF="342"/>
for which, to mark its abhorrence of them, the law
has appointed a more rigorous mode of execution, or some
indignity or farther injury, beside the loss of life.</P>
<P>FIRST, therefore, of the lowest degree of homicide, that
for which the killer is not liable to any sort of pain. This
subdivides into two species; being either <HI>casual,</HI> that which
happens by pure misadventure, without any act of the kill∣er's
will; or <HI>justifiable,</HI> which is committed intentionally,
but may be vindicated upon principles of duty.</P>
<P>TO bring his case within the description of <HI>casual</HI> homicide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casual Homi∣cide; what it is.</NOTE>
it is not sufficient for the pannel to show, that he had no
fixed and absolute purpose to kill. For if he had a purpose
to do any great and outrageous bodily harm, such as might
issue in death, and showed an utter indifference about the
safety of the sufferer; this is not only not innocent, but it is
nothing less than murder. We shall afterwards see, that the
books of adjournal contain many precedents to that effect.</P>
<P>FARTHER; where there is a wrongful purpose to do any
bodily harm, though not outrageous or excessive, still if
the event fall out unfortunately, so that it kills, the invader is
not entirely innocent of the blood of the deceased; since he
is thus far blameable, that he did a thing which was wrong
and unlawful in itself, and which could issue in the destruction
of his neighbour. It is an example of this, if without pro∣vocation
a person strike a single blow with the hand, and
it lights unluckily and kills; or if he violently jostle or
push a person aside, whereby he slips a foot, and breaks his
neck in the fall, or has his skull fractured, and dies. We
shall find, in speaking of culpable homicide, that we have
also many precedents of punishment, more or less, inflicted
<PB N="284" REF="343"/>
in cases of this description, according to the degree of the
wrong.</P>
<P>IN both these situations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casual Homi∣cide, Limitation of.</NOTE> there is a purpose of some
sort of harm to the person who actually suffers. But
the same holds equally good, if the homicide is done in
prosecution, generally, of any wrong and unlawful act,
though without malice to an individual. As if a person
fires a gun, loaded with powder only, in the streets of a
town, and the gun bursts, and a passenger is killed; or if a
piece of metal or other hard substance, has ignorantly and
accidentally been put into the gun in loading, and death
ensues; for the firing of a gun in such a situation is abso∣lately
wrong and unlawful. This last was the allegation
made in the case of James Niven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1795.</NOTE> who had killed by siring
his piece, loaded (as he said accidentally) with a bit of iron,
in a street of common passage, and at a time when several
persons were near him, and in sight. The Court were una∣nimously
of opinion, that even upon his own state of the
case, he would still be guilty of culpable homicide. But
the jury acquitted him of the whole charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This case is erroneously quoted in p. 6. as tried in March 1796. Notes of the opinions of the Judges in this case are printed in the Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casual Homi∣cide, Limitation of.</NOTE> some punishment is due, though the slaughter
happen in the performance even of a lawful act, if there be
culpable heedlessness and indiscretion, or a want of the due
caution and circumspection, in the way of doing the thing.
As if a man leave his fowling-piece loaded, and afterwards
kill in trying the lock, having forgot the condition in which
he left it. Or if in driving any carriage through the streets
<PB N="285" REF="344"/>
of a town, the driver quit his horses, and they run off with the
carriage, and a passenger is killed. Or if workmen upon
a building by the side of a highway, throw down rubbish
without timely warning to the passenger, that he may
avoid the danger. In all these cases, there is a want of
that attention, and due regard to the safety of one's neigh∣bour,
which justly makes one answerable for the consequen∣ces,
and punishable to that extent which may serve to cor∣rect
so faulty a habit of mind, either in one's self or in
others. Hereunto must be referred that judgment of rele∣vancy,
as for culpable homicide, which was given at Stir∣ling
in April 1789, in the case of one Henderson, who being at
a wedding, and having fired a pistol by the side of the high∣way,
to salute the couple as they passed, happened to kill
one of the party with the wadding only. The thing it∣self
could hardly be said to be unlawful, being usual on
such occasions; but the pannel was blameable in having fired
so near, and with that position of his arms which was at∣tended
with danger to his neighbour.</P>
<P>THIS may farther be illustrated by one situation more,
though not as yet tried in any of our Courts; that of a quack,
or ignorant and unlicensed practitioner of medicine, who rash∣ly
administers powerful and improper drugs, or in excessive and
unusual doses, or one drug by mistake for another; so that his
patient dies. It may, and I believe it will be very difficult to
find a case so circumstanced, as to be open to the application
of such a censure. Yet it cannot be denied, that there is a
high wrong, and criminal indiscretion in the conduct of such
a one, who knowingly puts his neighbour to hazard, though
in some measure with his own consent, by the use of such
extraordinary prescriptions as may possibly kill, or by fur∣nishing
medicines, without the due skill to distinguish be∣tween
<PB N="286" REF="345"/>
the different kinds. But this I only offer as a doubt
of my own.</P>
<P>THE result of these considerations seems to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of casual Homicide.</NOTE> that it is
only then a proper casual homicide, when a person uninten∣tionally
kills, who is lawfully employed, and neither has a
purpose of bodily harm to any one, nor has failed in the due
degree of care for preventing danger to his neighbour. Un∣der
this rule falls the case of Samuel Hale, a soldier, indict∣ed
in December 1726, for the murder of his fellow soldier
Rochford<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Sustain the indictment relevant to infer the pains libelled; but sustain the defence of casual homicide, proponed for the pannel, and remit,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> De∣cember 20. 1726.</NOTE>. It was pleaded for this man, that the deceased
having his musquet in his hand, which, unknown to the pan∣nel,
was loaded, it discharged in the course of some sport
or foolery that was going on between them. The Court su∣stained
the defence; and it was fully proved, along with
this circumstance in favour of the pannel, that while the
deceased was lying in the pannel's arms upon his death-bed,
he said, “That he verily believed that Samuel Hale
knew not that the piece was loaded, and that he freely
forgave him, and then stretched out his hand and kissed
Hale, and said he believed he meant him no harm.” The
jury, in consequence, found a verdict of <HI>not guilty.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the issue was different,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of casual Homicide. June 24. 1673.</NOTE> the like exception had been
found relevant in the older case of John Nicolson<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Finds both the libel and defence relevant, and remits the pannel to the knowledge of an assize upon both.”</NOTE>, who
alleged that his piece discharged and killed in the course of a
<PB N="287" REF="346"/>
struggle, in which the deceased was the aggressor, and had in∣vaded
his person. A more extraordinary case, and which end∣ed
favourably for the pannel, was that of John Leper.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 13. 1682.</NOTE> This
man, in his duty as town-officer, had apprehended a person
and carried him prisoner to the castle of Straven. On en∣tering
that building, which in some parts was waste and
ruinous, the prisoner had hastily run up stairs before the
pannel, who warned him of his danger, and was following
him with a candle to conduct him to his place of custody;
and in consequence, having mistaken the way, and passed
through a door which opened from the stair-case, the prisoner
fell down from thence into a paved hall or court-yard, to the
depth of more than twenty feet, and was killed. The
Court found this defence relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor. “Sustains the defences proponed for the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> that the defunct being carried to the Castle of Straven as prisoner, he went up stairs be∣fore the candle and the pannel, and that he was advertised before he came to the first door to beware of himself because of danger, and that notwithstanding he went up the stair and casually fell over the second door of the stair, rele∣vant to elide the dittay.”</NOTE> and the man was ac∣quitted.
Notice may also be taken of the case of William
Bathgate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. 1710.</NOTE> who being indicted for the murder of Andrew
Wood, by throwing him to the ground and beating him,
had this defence sustained to him, that the fall happened in
the course of a wrestling bout for sport, and was only in∣jurious
to the deceased, owing to his previous valetudinary
condition<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel, as libelled, only relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment; and sustained the defence proponed for the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> that the throwing down libelled was only a wrestling out of no malice or ill design, but only for diversion, and that previously thereto the defunct was valetudinary and sickly, and in a habit of spitting blood, <HI>relevant to elide the libel.”</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="347"/>
THESE cases may serve as illustrations of the nature of
casual homicide; that which happens without the act of the
killer's will.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justifiable Ho∣micide, what it is.</NOTE> Next of that sort of homicide, which though
intended, is justifiable; and of which the description seems
to be, that it is committed in the necessary prosecution of
that which the killer hath a right and is bound to do.</P>
<P>1. THIS is the situation of the Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Judge giving Doom to die.</NOTE> who pronounces the
sentence of the law on the malefactor, in pursuance of his
conviction of a capital offence, and of the proper officers,
who see that sentence duly put to execution. For the per∣sons
who officiate in either of these capacities, have no
choice nor will upon the matter, but are the mere organs
of the law, whose command they are necessitated to obey.
To enjoy the full benefit of this indemnity, the Judge must
however be such, whose office gives him cognizance of the
offence which he has tried; and he must have proceeded in
the exercise of his powers, according to the known rules
of law, and the settled order of his Court. A Sheriff, there∣fore,
who should condemn to death for rape or fire-raising;
or any inferior judge who should presume to hold process
for treason; or any judge who should try for witchcraft, or
should try for any capital offence without a jury; would, in
case of execution of his sentence, (if such a thing could
happen), be guilty of a murder, so much the more blame∣able
only as proceeding under colour and form of law.
The same would be his peril,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Judge err.</NOTE> who should try and condemn
for felony as Justice of the Peace, on the notion of his
name being in the commission, when in truth it is not there,
nor had ever been. That these persons have acted conscien∣tiously,
and in the belief of their respective powers, is a plea,
(how available soever in matters of patrimonial damage),
<PB N="289" REF="348"/>
which though it should even be true, the law cannot coun∣tenance
or pay regard to. The mistake was gross and pal∣pable;
the occasion called for the highest circumspec∣tion;
and he shall therefore be judged as if he had witting∣ly
and maliciously compassed the death of the person who
has fallen a victim to his ignorance or precipitation. With
all this, it is not however to be understood, that every error
of the judge with respect to the extent, or even the subsist∣ance
of his commission, is equally inexcusable, and puts him
in the same hazard of his life. But with respect to situa∣tions
of this character, which must always be rare, and
the precise bounds of the allowance which the law will
or ought to have of such irregularities; I shall not un∣dertake
the arduous task of conducting the reader through
so difficult, and hitherto unexplored a path, or of supplying
from my own lights, the defect of our records, which fur∣nish
no materials towards the decision of controversies of
so delicate a kind.</P>
<P>WHAT is true of the magistrate in the ordinary case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Officers executing capi∣tal Sentence.</NOTE>
is no less so of the officer employed to execute the sentence;
who, to have the protection of the law, must be the proper
officer, to whom the execution of that sentence belongs, and
has been committed. A mob, for instance, who break into
the goal, and carry forth the capital convict and put him
to death, are guilty of no lower crime than murder; though
to save appearances, (but which only serves to make the
abuse the more remarkable) they proceed in this scheme of
vengeance on the very day, and in the manner mentioned
in the doom. For in their hands it is not at all an execu∣tion
of sentence, but an act of malicious and outrageous
<PB N="290" REF="349"/>
revenge on the individual, as well as an open contempt of
the magistrate, and of the established order of justice.</P>
<P>FARTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Sen∣tence executed by a wrong Per∣son.</NOTE> and which is not so strong a case: If the warrant
of execution is addressed to the magistrates of a burgh, and
they decline to execute the duty; how wrong and how pre∣judicial
soever such conduct on their part, still no private per∣son,
nor even any other magistrate of that place or neigh∣bourhood,
such as a Justice of the Peace, or the Sheriff of
the county, can without his own peril interpose, to take the
duty of execution on himself. Nay, it may even be main∣tained
to fall within the same rule, though the sentence be
executed at the proper time and place, and by the ordinary
magistrate to whom in common course the <HI>dead warrant</HI> falls
to be directed; if he proceed therein on sight only of the
books of adjournal, or on report of the clerk of Court, or on
common same and notoriety, without such warrant actually
made out and delivered to him. For this is a duty of that
nature, which to be justified in performing, a person must
be necessitated to undertake; so that he shall not be held
free of malice, if he is forward to offer himself to it, or
step out of the ordinary course of form and business, to
intermeddle with or enquire about it. Somewhat a-kin to
this, and to be judged in the same manner, is the case of a
magistrate, who proceeds of his own knowledge, and without
a new warrant from the proper Court, to execute a convict
who has escaped from goal, and is not recovered till after
the day appointed for his execution; though certainly if
the magistrate appear to have acted conscientiously, and in
the thorough belief of his powers, his case may be a proper
object of the interposition of the royal mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="350"/>
IN conducting the execution, the magistrate is in like
manner to be guided by the terms of the sentence, and war∣rant
in pursuance thereof to him addressed. That is to say,
any material and unnecessary variation from the warrant
shall bring the case to be the same, as if the sufferer had not
been under sentence of death. Thus if the magistrate shall
burn a convict, whose sentence is to be hanged upon a gib∣bet;
or, instead of a public execution, if he have him strang∣led
privately in goal; or if he negligently let the day of
execution pass, and think to make amends by executing the
convict on some later day; it seems clearly to be such a ho∣micide,
for which the offender shall be answerable with his
own life: seeing in all these instances there is a wilful va∣riation
in matters which are conditions of the sentence,
and that his conduct herein shows a degree of <HI>malus animus,</HI>
or criminal contempt and disregard, more or less, with re∣spect
to the unfortunate object of his unwarrantable pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>IT is no less necessary to remark on the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution vary∣ing from the Warrant.</NOTE> that this
rigour is only suitable to the ordinary case; where, if atten∣tive,
and in the due disposition of mind, the magistrate has it
in his power to proceed according to the letter of his war∣rant.
Where this is not so, and the obstacle is owing to the
fault of others, not to that of the magistrate himself, it were
against all reason to judge him by the same rules. Thus
our sentence of death, by ordinary style, directs the convict
to be hanged upon <HI>a gibbet</HI> by the hands of the <HI>common execu∣tioner,</HI>
between the hours <HI>of two and four.</HI> But if the com∣mon
executioner shall die, or run away, or refuse the duty
when the day comes, and if the magistrate shall carry the
sentence into effect by the hands of any other person, or
<PB N="292" REF="351"/>
even by his own hands, if he can find no one to undertake
the office, is it to be thought that he is therefore guilty of
murder; or is he not rather commendable for thus hinder∣ing
the sentence of the law to be disappointed, which if delay∣ed
to be fulfilled for so trivial a reason, could not afterwards
be at all put in execution? Or if a mob rise and pull down
the gibbet, and the judgment shall in consequence be car∣ried
into effect upon a tree, sign-post, or the like, as nigh as
can be found to the ordinary place of execution, and with
as near regard as the circumstances of the case allow to the
terms of the sentence; or if the multitude shall rescue the
criminal, and keep him for a time in their own hands, so
that the precise hour has passed before the last step of exe∣cution;
it seems that either this is no crime at all, (being
done under the firm impression of right and duty), or at the
worst it is a misdemeanour or irregularity, of a nature quite
remote from the crime of homicide, and to which some
very moderate censure only can be applied.</P>
<P>2. NEXT in degree to these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Suppression of a Riot.</NOTE> which are of the highest ne∣cessity
of any, is the case of that homicide which is com∣mitted
by a magistrate, or on his order, in suppression of
a riotous assembly. Now, with respect to this matter, which
shall be considered more at large under the head of riot, it
is in this place only necessary to observe, that to maintain
the King's peace, and disperse tumultuous convocations, and
arrest the delinquents, is an undoubted and important part of
the duty of every magistrate within his bounds; and such,
which if any one shall altogether decline, or be slack and
slow to perform, he shall not stand acquitted of the public
trust which is reposed in him. If, therefore, in his lawful
and laudable exertions towards this end, he shall be opposed
<PB N="293" REF="352"/>
or resisted by the offenders, who will not desist, nor disperse,
nor suffer themselves to be apprehended, but make head
against the magistrate and his <HI>posse,</HI> and violently molest
and hinder him therein, certainly he may make good his
purpose by force, and at the hazard of their lives; so he do
not employ such means unnecessarily, nor before the proper
season. This is the clear doctrine of the common law,
founded in reason and necessity, and without which the ends
of government cannot be answered, and to which, accord∣ing
to all authorities<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Hale, vol. 1. p. 53. 293. 495.; Hawkins, vol. 1. c. 28. No. 14. c. 65. No. 11.; Foster, p. 270. No. 2.; Blackstone, b. 4. c. 14. p. 179 180.</NOTE>, the declaration of the riot-act makes
no addition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st Geo. I. c. 5.</NOTE> farther than as it raises the bare continuance
of the riotous assembly for a certain space into a capital fe∣lony,
and thus determines a particular season, after which
the rioters are more inexcusable, and the magistrate shall be
more to blame, if he suffer the disorder to continue. In
like manner, though the time limited in that statute be not
expired, or though proclamation have not been made as
there directed; yet if the multitude proceed to outrageous
acts of violence against property or person, here also is the
magistrate not only entitled, but obliged to interpose in aid
and protection of the individual, and to repel this unlawful
force with force, without consideration of the consequence
to the invaders. For this too was always the common law,
and can never be construed to be taken away by those new
provisions which have been made for the more effectual sup∣pression
of tumults, and in enlargement of the ordinary
powers of the magistrate. The incidents of this sort which
have happened in Scotland, have been attended with such
decisive circumstances in favour of the magistrate, as has
<PB N="294" REF="353"/>
hindered them to be made, in any one instance, the subject
of prosecution against him.</P>
<P>3. NEXT of homicide committed by the officers of ju∣stice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Resistance of criminal War∣rant.</NOTE>
or their assistants, who are employed in the searching
for and taking, conveying, or sure-keeping of persons char∣ged
with crimes. Upon this important article the doctrine
of the law of England, seems by the concurrence of all au∣thorities
to be settled thus: That the felon who resists the
officers of justice having warrant, or called by hue and
cry against him by name, to hinder their taking him, or who
being taken assaults them, or the goaler who keeps him, to
make his escape, may lawfully be killed; nay that the same
is even true of the felon who flies from execution of the
criminal process, if he cannot be taken alive. This too shall
equally be the rule, though the person against whom the
warrant is, should truly be an innocent man; for he ought
to yield himself to the justice of his country, and answer
to the charge that is on record against him. Nor do I find
that in this matter any distinction is taken from the sort of
weapon, mortal or not mortal, with which the resistance or
assault is made; but only the just and salutary caution is
added, that the slaughter be necessary to the taking or re∣covering
of the person. In judging however of this neces∣sity,
it is not to be understood that the officer of justice,
like a private man, is obliged to give back on the assault
or resistance: on the contrary, his commission justifies him
in continually pressing forward to his object<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 481. 490.; Foster, p. 270, 271, 272, 318.; Hawkins, p. 70, 71.; Blackst. b. 4. c. 14. No. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="354"/>
THESE rules seem to be grounded in reason and sound
policy; in as much as they tend to the preventing of broils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Resistance of criminal War∣rant.</NOTE>
and to exalt the authority of the law, as well as to protect
the persons of its ministers, and to insure the course of cri∣minal
justice. But that the practice of Scotland shall in all
points be governed by the same considerations; and, in par∣ticular,
that it shall make the same allowance in the case of
the felon barely flying from the warrant that is out against
him; or in general, that our law has in this article attained
to the same maturity as that of England, cannot perhaps,
upon the state of our records, be affirmed. Such precedents as
they afford, are however, upon that side of the question.
One is the case of John Gillespie and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 24. 1694.</NOTE> who were in∣dicted
for the murder of Major Menzies. The pannels were
private persons, dispatched on a verbal order of the magis∣trates
of Glasgow, in pursuit of Menzies, who a few hours
before had committed a murder, and had fled. Having
found him, they fired at and killed him, on his refusal to
surrender, and preparation to resist them with a drawn sword
in his hand; but before he had made a pass or thrust at
any of the party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 8.</NOTE> The Court found the defence relevant;
and the pannels had a verdict in their favour.</P>
<P>IN this instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Resistance of criminal War∣rant.</NOTE> the resistance was with a mortal weapon,
and by a person who was charged with a capital offence.
But it is scarcely to be thought that there is room for any
settled distinction in law, to be taken from these, the aggra∣vating
circumstances of the situation. That which in any
case of resistance to a criminal warrant justifies the homi∣cide,
is the attempt, with probable success, to disappoint the
course of public justice, and the contemptuous defiance of
the powers of the state in this high and interesting part of
<PB N="296" REF="355"/>
public order. The necessity which the officer hath lain un∣der
to kill, is therefore, in every instance, to be judged of on
the whole circumstances of the situation; and to allow his
privilege in regard only to criminals of the highest degree,
would be a pernicious, and indeed impracticable distinction,
which would vilify, as well the law and the magistrate, as
the person and commission of the officer, with the very per∣sons
whom they are employed to overawe.</P>
<P>THE case of Samuel Burch, tried in July 1748, seems here
to be in point. This man was a sergeant in the recruiting
service at Lanark. Where, happening to have a quarrel
with one Ramage, an inhabitant of the place, the matter
was carried before the magistrate of the burgh, who found
Ramage in the wrong, and partly for that reason, but more
on account of contempt of himself in the course of the en∣quiry,
gave warrant to commit him. A multitude assembled
to rescue Ramage; and Burch with his party, was ordered to
assist in conveying him to gaol. In the course of carrying
him thither, and upon the steps in front of the goal, the par∣ty
were assaulted. Numbers of people pressed upon them,
and the soldiers were struck with staves by Ramage as
well as others; stones also were thrown at them, and at
length, a drummer was pulled down the steps by the hair,
to the ground; whereupon Burch drew his sword, and
by threats and feigned passes, disengaged his party for a
time. The attack was, however, renewed in the same fa∣shion;
some of the assailants, who had got higher upon the
steps pushing him down, while others, who were below,
pressed him the other way. In this situation, after striking
certain of them with the flat of his sword, he at length made
a thrust at one Aitken and killed him. This was the amount
of the proof: upon which the jury found it proved, that
<PB N="297" REF="356"/>
what he did “was in self-defence, and in the execution of
his office.” The strength of his plea lay, however, in the
circumstance of duty. For otherwise the danger of his per∣son
was hardly to be reckoned of that imminent and pres∣sing
kind, which would have made a case of pure self-de∣fence
to an individual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 54.</NOTE> invaded in his ordinary business.
The pannel was dismissed from the bar.</P>
<P>THIS high privilege of the officer and his party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the cri∣minal Warrant be wrong.</NOTE> who are
employed in the taking or conveying of a criminal, is al∣ways
to be received under the provision that he is bearer of
a lawful warrant; granted by one who has cognisance of
that matter, allowable to be issued on that occasion, and
proceeded with by the officer and his party in due and
reasonable manner. In any of which points, if there be
a plain and gross irregularity; as if the warrant is not
signed, or is signed by one who is not a magistrate for that
district, or does not bear the offender's name, or if the
officer has it not upon him at the time, or goes out of his
bounds to execute it, or lays hold of a wrong person, or
breaks up the door of a house in the night without demand
of entry, or notice given of the warrant: In all these cases,
being no longer within the rule of his duty, he forfeits the
privilege of his office in this particular, and cannot be
fully <HI>justified</HI> for any slaughter which ensues. Though,
whether in every case of this description his guilt shall
amount to murder, or sometimes only to some lower sort of
homicide, is a separate and more difficult question; of
which in its proper place.</P>
<P>IT seems however to be the more reasonable sentiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Warrant be wrong.</NOTE>
that the officer shall lose his privilege in the case only of
<PB N="298" REF="357"/>
such vices, which are in the immediate frame and texture
of the warrant; and that he is not affected by those more
remote and extrinsic, and to him unknown and unsearchable
irregularities, which have happened in the way of applying
for the warrant, or in the proceedings which have been the
grounds of obtaining it. A sheriff-officer kills upon re∣sistance
by a criminal, against whom there is an English
warrant, which the Sheriff has indorsed, in compliance with
the statute in that behalf. It is afterwards found, that the
first warrant was not obtained in the due course of the law
of England. Nevertheless, the Sheriff and his officer shall
have a clear defence, being neither of them bound to know,
nor entitled to enquire concerning the forms of issuing an
English warrant; but the one necessitated to obey the com∣mand
of his superior, as the other is to comply with the re∣quisition
of the law, upon proof made to him of the verity
of the warrant, after the manner appointed by the statute.
Or put the case, that the magistrate is imposed on by calum∣nious
information, or, which is more unfavourable, that
without any proper charge or information lodged with him,
he on his own suspicion, rashly, or even maliciously, issues
warrant against such a one by name, as accused of a high
crime. This will not hinder the killing of him to be law∣ful,
if he violently resist; for the officer can do no other
than obey the order of the magistrate; and it is therefore
the duty of the party to submit to him therein, and seek his
remedy in course of law.</P>
<P>ON all occasions where the officer would be justified in
killing the felon himself on his resistance, he shall equally
be justified in killing those, (as in the case of Burch), who
wilfully take part with the criminal, and by force obstruct
and stay him in his pursuit. And what is true of the mini∣sters
<PB N="299" REF="358"/>
of the law themselves, seems to be no less so of their
concurrents, lawfully commanded to assist them; so they
may be known for such to the party resisting, and are not
chargeable with any precipitation or excess in their pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>4. TOUCHING the case of process or diligence of a civil
nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re∣sistance of civil Process.</NOTE> there are plain and sufficient reasons why the officer
should not be allowed so broad a privilege, as for the execu∣tion
of criminal warrants, wherein not only is the public in∣terest
concerned, but the party is under higher temptation to
withdraw himself from the law. In England therefore,
the rule with regard to any pure civil process, or process
on account of trespass is, that the party cannot be killed in
flying from it, but on his resistance of it only<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 28. No. 17. 20. Foster, p. 271. No. 3. Hale, vol. i. p. 481.</NOTE>. The
doubt with us will not be, whether to go farther for pro∣tection
of the officer, but whether we will go so far, and hold
a messenger to be justifiable for such slaughter, as he neces∣sarily
doth towards the execution of a poinding, caption,
or other civil diligence to apprehend. The following seem
to be the chief precedents upon this matter, though perhaps
neither so numerous, nor so conclusive, as might be wished
in so interesting an article of the law.</P>
<P>THE first is the case of James Gordon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re∣sistance of civil Process.</NOTE> messenger, and
eleven others his assistants, indicted for the murder of Alex∣ander
Jack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. 27. and 31. 1691.</NOTE> whom they had shot in the execution of two
captions against him, one of which appears to have been
a caption of lawborrows. Their defence was twofold.
1<HI>st,</HI> The danger of their lives; having been invaded with
<PB N="300" REF="359"/>
mortal weapons, fired upon, and pursued from place to
place under night by a host of people. 2<HI>dly,</HI> Execution of
their duty<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The pannel maintains his defence of deforcement to be good, “because the pannel coming to execute a caption, he was authorised by their Majesties au∣thority, and being attacked in the execution, was thereby warranted to keep his post and defend against aggressors; and his being so warranted, did allow to him and his party a greater latitude of defence, especially when aggressed un∣der cloud of night by armed men, who actually first shot, than if he had been first stated in the case of precise self-defence, <HI>tanquam quilibet.</HI> And to al∣lege that the messenger finding opposition or resistance at the house, should only have broke his wand, and protested, and then might have insisted for his deforcement, as a distinct crime punishable by confiscation, it is <HI>gratis dictum;</HI> and the messenger was <HI>in optima fide</HI> to stay and wait his time for making open doors, conform to the warrant of the letters.”</P>
<P>The pursuer answered, “That the defence founded on deforcement is noways relevant, seeing by our law deforcement is ane distinct crime, and punished with a distinct punishment, <HI>viz.</HI> by confiscation of moveables, and by coming into the King's will as to their lives. And therefore, although they had been deforced, which is positively denied; yet all that in law could have been done is, that the messenger should have broke his wand of peace, and protested for remeid of law; and therefore deforcement is noways relevant, unless that the messenger and his assistants had been <HI>in periculo vitae,</HI> and could not otherwise have escaped.”</P></NOTE>; which last was sustained in these terms: “Su∣stain
the defence for James Gordon, messenger, <HI>and his
assistants,</HI> (except as to the said Mr Robert Keith of Len∣tush,
in as far allenarly as concerns the arbitrary punish∣ment
underwritten), <HI>in execution of the caption produced,</HI> in
thir terms, <HI>viz.</HI> that the said James Gordon, messenger,
having his blason displayed, was by force of arms hinder∣ed
to enter the house of Longmay by the persons within
that house, and that they did threaten and menace the
person of the messenger, and his assistants, in the terms
libelled, or by words to that purpose and effect; and that
Mr James White, or one or other of the persons com∣plained
<PB N="301" REF="360"/>
upon, did threaten to raise the country, with the
expressions libelled, or words to that purpose, and that
shortly thereafter the country did rise and beset and sur∣round
the messenger and his assistants, either in the house
or without the house, the said country people being arm∣ed
with swords, guns, or invasive weapons, and that be∣fore
the committing of the slaughter; relevant to elide the
libel <HI>simpliciter quoad the messenger and his assistants;</HI> Len∣tush
excepted as above.” This prosecution was deserted
by warrant from the Privy Council in November 1691.</P>
<P>IN the same year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re∣sistance of civil Process.</NOTE> William Fife, messenger in Paisley, and
his assistants, were indicted for the murder of Andrew Wil∣son,
an infirm old man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. &amp; 30. 1691.</NOTE> who had come forth in order to
rescue his son-in-law, one Peoch, their prisoner, taken upon
caption<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In one place he pleads, “That however the remedy mentioned in our sta∣tutes, of breaking the wand of peace, may have been thought suitable by the Legislature to that kind of deforcement that is carried on without invading the messenger with weapons offensive; yet it is not to be supposed that the meaning of the law would be beyond the expression of it, to preclude the Go∣vernment and its ministers from the benefit of those remedies, which by the principles and practiques of all laws and nations of the world, is competent upon a violent invading of authority in the person of the messenger, who, as executor of the law, is the life of it.”</P>
<P>In another place thus: “That the authority of the Government being the only thing in danger by such an attack upon a messenger, the law warrants his resisting such opposition in manner alleged for him, albeit his own person were in no danger, otherways the power that the messenger is entrusted with would put him in no special case from the rest of the lieges; to whom, <HI>de jure com∣muni,</HI> the allegeance of self-defence is always competent, albeit they have nei∣ther Government nor authority to protect them.”</P></NOTE>. This interlocutor was given on the defence and
reply: “As also, finds the defence, that William Fife,
messenger, and the other two pannels, his assistants, had
<PB N="302" REF="361"/>
Peoch their prisoner, by an execute caption, and that the
defunct did by violence offer to rescue him, and did ac∣tually
draw a daiger upon William Fife, the pannel, in∣vading
him therewith, relevant to elide the libel <HI>simpli∣citer.</HI>”
It was found relevant to elide this defence, that
the messenger killed the deceased at a time when he was
rescuing his son-in-law from a mastiff, which had thrown
him to the ground. It appeared in evidence, that Fife had
severely wounded Wilson with a sword, on his first coming
to the spot and showing a disposition to resist, and before
his drawing of the dagger. His defence was found not
proved, and he had sentence of death.</P>
<P>THE next case is that of Simpson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re∣sistance of civil Process.</NOTE> and others, tried in July
1757; which had a more fortunate issue for the pannels.
The matter which gave occasion to the slaughter, was a
warrant issued by the Justices of the Peace for East Lothian,
to apprehend and bring before them one George Wood, a
loose fellow, and a notorious poacher, with a view to his
being sent off as a soldier, under authority of a statute
of the time. The man was known to be of a hardy and
desperate nature, and the constable took assistance of sol∣diers
to his house. Where, when they had arrived, and had
notified their errand to him, posted as they were upon the
steps and threshold, he answered by discharging a fowling-piece,
loaded with ball, through the door. The soldiers
now loaded their pieces at the constable's command, and
standing aside from the door and the steps, they fired
into the house; one of which shots taking an oblique di∣rection,
killed the man, standing in his shirt, upon the
hearth, in his own apartment. The pannels farther prov∣ed,
that Wood had formed the resolution not to be ta∣ken
<PB N="303" REF="362"/>
alive, and kept several pieces ready loaded in the house.
There was no special interlocutor of the Court upon the de∣fence,
(for before this time the practice had ceased of pro∣nouncing
any such); but the jury thought favourably of the
case, and found a verdict for the pannels.</P>
<P>A SPECIAL relevancy had been found in a former, and
very similar case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. &amp; 19. 1711.</NOTE> that of the Master of Elphinston; where
the party resister did indeed survive the injury, but received
three wounds with a sword, of which he lingered for a time,
in great danger of his life. The Master of Elphinston was
an officer in the service of the King, and had accompanied
a constable to the house of one Dick, to take him on a war∣rant
from the Justices, as a proper person to be comprehend∣ed
under the statute, for a soldier. The persons within re∣fused
admittance, and fired on the party from the house;
whereupon the party broke in, and Dick was severely wound∣ed.
“The Lords find the libel against the Master of El∣phinston
as libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment;
and sustained the defence proponed for the Master,
that what he did was in assistance of the constable, to be
aiding to him at that time in execution of his office, com∣mitted
to him by the act 7<HI>mo Annae,</HI> anent recruiting his
Majesty's forces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or <HI>separatim,</HI> that what he did was
in self-defence, relevant to elide the libel, and repelled
the other defences and replies.” The jury found the li∣bel
not proved, and the pannel was assoilzied.</P>
<P>NOW it is to be observed of all these cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re∣sistance of civil Process.</NOTE> that it is some∣thing
more ample than the common plea of self-defence,
that is sustained to absolve the pannels; neither does any of
the interlocutors make use of that term, nor require the <HI>peri∣culum
vilae</HI> to exculpate. To have the benefit of self-defence,
<PB N="304" REF="363"/>
the pannel must be able to say that he has retired from the
invader, and avoided the assault, as far as with safety to
himself he could; and that it was only out of necessity he
killed, when he was otherwise in imminent and instant dan∣ger
of his life. Now in no one of these cases is it alleged
for the pannel that he at all yielded or gave back; and in any
one of them, and more especially in the two last, where a
locked door was between the hostile parties, he might at once
have put his person in security, by abandoning the object of
his warrant, on the threats and preparation of resistance.
It is indeed evident, that to apply the common rule of self-defence
in this department, and confine the officers of the
law to the same narrow path as ordinary men, would put
them in continual hazard of obstruction and deforcement,
to the utter ruin of their authority and that of the law;
till at last, (as I find it expressed in an old pleading<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Case of Mackintosh in 1673.</NOTE>),
“every man's sword would become his own suspension,
and the discharge of his debt.” Even the firing at the
officer, or an assault on him with mortal weapons, could not,
upon that principle, justify him in the use of the like force,
or in advancing to prosecute his purpose: For by the con∣sent
of all authorities, any such forward movement is sub∣versive
of the pure plea of self-defence. But an officer of
the law, bearing the lawful warrant of a magistrate, has
other considerations to attend to before the safety of the
person who wrongfully opposes him; other duties to fulfil be∣side
those of mere humanity; and must therefore have the
benefit of quite a different presumption in his favour. If
the party fly, he must follow; if he resist, far from yielding,
he must stand to and maintain his service; and in doing
<PB N="305" REF="364"/>
otherwise, he is guilty of a misdemeanour, tending to weak∣en
the authority of the law, and unhinge the order of the
State. If, therefore, he be reduced to the necessity of ei∣ther
killing the resister or abandoning his warrant, the law
cannot in justice refuse to hold it for a slaughter done from
constraint of his duty, and in nowise out of malice or re∣sentment.
Nor does it weigh against this view of the si∣tuation,
that, in all instances of personal diligence, the
slaughter, instead of fulfilling, defeats the object of the war∣rant.
For that which the Judge chiefly considers in these
questions, is not so much the carrying of the particular war∣rant
into effect, as the vindicating of the authority of law,
and of the magistrate, which would otherwise fall into con∣tempt.
And herein, as I conceive, lies one reason why, in
England, the person who flies from execution of a civil pro∣cess
cannot be killed, though he who resists it lawfully may.
His flight may be the most effectual disappointment of the
warrant, even more so than his resistance: But in flying he
does not dispute, he rather yields to and acknowledges, the
authority of the mandate which is sent against him.</P>
<P>THE rule seems therefore to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Resistance of civil Process.</NOTE> (and this, as I conceive,
is the meaning of what Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Murder, No. 19.</NOTE> has said upon the
subject), that in like manner as one may kill in defence of
one's life, if one cannot otherwise save it; so an officer of the
law may kill in defence of his office and his warrant, if ne∣cessary
it be to the doing of his duty, and carrying his
commission into effect. In judging however of this necessity,
and of the kind and degree of resistance which shall be held
to justify on such an occasion, the rule, as far as can be ga∣thered
from our records, and in itself a salutary and rea∣sonable
rule, appears to be, that none is held sufficient,
<PB N="306" REF="365"/>
which does not carry evidence with it to the officer, that
his life <HI>shall come</HI> to be in hazard, if he shall persist in the exe∣cution
of his warrant. According to any light with which
the practice of past times supplies us, the dread of a wrestling-bout
or struggle, or even of a beating and bruising, in the
prosecution of the service, shall not be held a relevant de∣fence;
nor indeed any thing short of the preparation of
lethal weapons against the officer, or of such a power and
force, as, in the whole circumstances of the case, plainly
inform him, that but with the peril of his life he can∣not
<HI>advance</HI> to do his duty. The difference, therefore, be∣tween
the case of the officer and of an ordinary man lies
here. An individual, to justify his killing of the invader,
must be in actual and instant danger of his own life <HI>as at
the moment of killing,</HI> and so situated, that unless by sacri∣ficing
the invader, he has no means of escaping alive. But
the officer shall be acquitted, if, at the time of killing, that
danger be <HI>in near and manifest preparation for him,</HI> so as in
reason to convince him that <HI>he shall come to be in danger of his
life,</HI> in the farther prosecution of his duty, and although,
by deserting the service, he might at once put an end to the
hazard. A messenger, for instance, bearer of a caption, if, on
coming to the house, he find a <HI>posse</HI> of the debtor's friends
posted at the door with drawn swords, and resolute to
oppose his entry, may justify the advancing and firing up∣on
them, though no thrust have yet been made at him,
and before coming within reach of their weapons; for his
life and theirs are not, in these circumstances, of equal
value to the law, nor is he obliged to expose himself so far
on their account<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Mackenzie (Tit. Murder, No. 19.) quotes the case of Macintosh and Fle∣ming, as a decision on the power of messengers, when resisted without the use of arms. But although that topic is discussed, along with others, in a very full de∣bate, it does not seem to be decided by the interlocutor, which only finds that the libel was relevant, notwithstanding the <HI>messenger's execution</HI> bearing the pannel Fleming to have been a witness to the caption. The messenger was not himself under trial; and the allegation against the pannels was, that they, out of the pre∣sence of the messenger, and after he had gone off, without showing or attempting to execute the caption assaulted and killed the person against whom the caption, was, as also his brother, after the other had been slain. Farther, this was alleged to be done while these two persons were flying, and were pursued by six or seven.</P>
<P>Another case to which reference has often been made, is that of Archibald Beath, June 14. 1672. The Lords of Privy Council had issued a proclamation, authorising the lieges to hinder the importation of Irish victual, and to seize the same on any attempt to land it. A boat, loaded with Irish victual had come to Lamlash in Arran, where Mr Beath, a clergyman, and a number of other persons, armed, seized and took possession of it. Afterwards, in the absence of Beath, the crew recovered it from certain of the party with whom it was left in charge, and set sail to make their escape. Beath and his armed party in another boat pursued, and, on refusal to surrender, fired, and killed two of the crew. Now in this there was a plain precipitation and excess. It was the use of fire arms against a party who were not armed, and flying, and who are neither alleged nor proved to have offered any violence to Beath's party, but only to have threatened to run down his boat: Not to mention that it might well be doubted whether the pro∣clamation meant to authorise a seizure by force of arms, or only <HI>civiliter</HI> by more orderly means. The Court repelled his defences, and the jury found him guilty, but the royal mercy interposed. The proof in the case is short, and only esta∣blishes the facts of shooting and killing, without any of the alleged circumstances, prior or concomitant.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="366"/>
5. ANOTHER article, which will require our attention, is
the nature of a soldier's privilege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldiers in their Duty.</NOTE> when opposed or assault∣ed
in execution of his duty. Now, this may seem to be en∣titled
to at least as liberal a construction as that of any officer
of the law, on account of the nature of the man's employ∣ment;
maintained as he is by the State, for the very pur∣pose
of repressing the disorderly, and being trained there∣in
to contempt and resistance of all invasion, and more∣over
being himself liable in high pains for disobedience or
<PB N="308" REF="367"/>
neglect of orders, and even for any common regard of his
own safety in the execution of them. All which conside∣rations,
as they serve to separate the soldier from the mass
of ordinary citizens, and to nourish a peculiar character in
him, and a higher jealousy of disgrace or affront, (without
which he were unfit for the duties of his profession); so do
they in justice require a higher allowance of his forward∣ness
in the maintaining of his service, whatsoever it is for
the time, and are withal a warning to every one, not to
molest or meddle with him therein.</P>
<P>THE precise boundaries of this allowance, I shall not at∣tempt,
(indeed I should be loath if I could), to define. This,
however, in a general way, the judgments of the Court
enable me to say, that an invasion with mortal weapons, or
an actual and instant danger of death, is not necessary to
entitle the soldier to use the arms which the State has given
him; and therefore given him, that he and his duty may be
secure, and in no danger of surprise, or material hinder∣ance.
In putting them into his hands, it is the intention of
the State, and of the law, that in every case he shall keep
them safe, and his person in condition to use them with ef∣fect;
and that on any post or station which is assigned him,
he shall maintain it surely, not only against actual capture
of his arms, but against any considerable risk of such a mis∣fortune.
Which if he actually suffers by the loss of them,
or if he shall quit his station without being relieved, he is
liable to death by the mutiny-act, which is an annual statute,
and part of the system of our law. Not only, therefore,
the hostile invasion of his person with arms, but any violent
attack upon him with other weapons, or any outrageous and
alarming tumult raised against him, when at his post or in
his duty, authorises him to be active in repelling it, and
<PB N="309" REF="368"/>
shall indemnify him for any slaughter that ensues. Not
that he can be justified (no one can be of this opinion) for
mortally resenting a slight indignity, or for quelling every
insignificant disturbance with force of arms; but this only,
that being invaded in his duty, he shall be justified by a
much lower violence and interference, than would be ne∣cessary
to excuse another man. The following are among
the cases, which may be mentioned in evidence of this ex∣position
of the law.</P>
<P>On the 3d of August 1692,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldiers in their Duty.</NOTE> Captain John Wallace was in∣dicted
for the murder of three boys, and the wounding of
several others, by ordering his company to fire upon a crowd
of people in the street. The pannel answered, that he had
orders from the Privy Council to keep guard with his com∣pany,
at the Abbey of Holyroodhouse; that there had for some
days been tumults in the city, and the rabble had threaten∣ed
mischief to his guard, and to the building; and that at
length, on the day libelled, they assembled in numbers, some
of them with arms, and came down to his post, where
(but without using mortal weapons) they beat his centinels;
and that though warned they persisted to advance against
his company; whereupon, to maintain his post, he gave or∣ders
to fire. The first part of this defence, relative to the
conspiracy and threats of mischief, was found relevant to
restrict the libel to an arbitrary pain, and the actual assault,
to elide the charge <HI>simpliciter</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor: “And finds this defence, that on the Sabbath night, or short∣ly before, a rabble did meet in several places in great numbers, and that seve∣rals of them did declare to John Paterson, their resolution to trouble the pan∣nel and his guaird, and to pillage the Abbay, relevant to restrict to an arbitra∣ry punishment; and finds, that the following defence, that the said rabble did, in a tumultuous manner, come down the Canongate with swords and fyre arms, and did beat some of the pannell's centinalls; and that being desyred to stand, they notwithstanding advanced so near, that the pannell could speak to them, and after he had desyred them to remove, or be at their hazard, they notwithstanding thereof, still persisted to advance, relevant to elide that part of the lybel <HI>simpliciter.</HI>” August 4. 1692.</NOTE>. The libel was found not
<PB N="310" REF="369"/>
proved, and the exculpation proved; and Captain Wallace
was dismissed from the bar.</P>
<P>IN this case there had been arms among the rabble;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE>
though it is not said that any use was made of them, before
the order was given to fire. But in the case of William
Hunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 19. 1711.</NOTE> dragoon, the invaders were not provided with any war∣like
weapons. This man was indicted for the murder of
Henry Macmillan, committed on the street of Dalkeith, by
a violent blow given him on the head with a clubbed mus∣quet
from behind; whereby the musquet was broken, and
the man so hurt, that he died on the succeeding day. He
pleaded, that the deceased was one of a rabble upon the
street who had insulted, abused, and beaten down certain of
the soldiers; and that on this occasion the guard, of which
Hunt was one, being ordered to relieve them, and an attack
being made on them with poles, clubs, shovels, and other the
like hasty weapons, he killed Macmillan in the execution of
this duty. In these terms the defence was found relevant
to assoilzie; and at the same time this other defence, that the
slaughter was committed <HI>in rixa,</HI> of which the deceased
was himself the author, was found only relevant to Hunt, as
an ordinary individual, to restrict the libel to an arbitrary
<PB N="311" REF="370"/>
punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And find this defence, <HI>viz.</HI> That there being a tumult at Dalkeith, in which some of the dragoons were maltreated or trodden down, and the pannel being upon the guard under duty at the time, was commanded out for quelling the mob or tumult, and relieving the dragoons; and that the defunct having been in the rabble and tumult which attacked the party of the guard com∣manded out, or any of them, before the stroack was given, relevant to assoilzie the pannel <HI>simpliciter,</HI> and elide the libel; and <HI>separatim,</HI> found that the stroack being given <HI>in rixa</HI> or a tumult, where the defunct was author of the tumult or <HI>rixa</HI> himself, or that the stroack was given in defence of the pannel, or any of his fellow soldiers, when attacked, relevant to restrict the libel to an arbitra∣ry punishment.”</NOTE>. The jury found a special verdict, which did
not establish that Hunt was the person who struck the de∣ceased;
and he was therefore assoilzied.</P>
<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> and no less apposite case, is that of John Will∣house,
sergeant, Thomas Turner, Thomas Fraser, and John
Muircock, private soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 16. June 15. &amp; 16. 1730.</NOTE> indicted for the murder of Chris∣tian
Greig and George Thomson, two of a multitude, upon
whom they had fired. The case was thus. The pannels, a∣long
with one soldier more, had been called out for protection
of a cargo of contraband spirits, which was already in the
hands of the revenue-officer, who had impressed the King's
mark upon the casks. While posted at the house where the
casks lay, and in the absence (as far as appears) of the re∣venue-officer,
the soldiers were assaulted by a mob of men
and women, who with stones, clubs, and the like, broke in
upon the party; and among other injuries heat down one of
the soldiers to the ground with a plough-paddle, took pos∣session
of his musquet, and abused his person, while lying
on the ground. In these circumstances the sergeant, with∣out
retiring into the house, gave orders to his party to fire;
and two persons were killed. The Court found the defence
<PB N="312" REF="371"/>
relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Lords find the said pannels, or any of them, having, time and place libel∣led, killed Christian Greig and George Thomson, or either of them, or their being art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of law; but <HI>for eleiding thereof,</HI> sustain this defence, that the said pannels were actually for some time in the possession or custody of certain goods seized by Daniel Macaula, who called them to his assistance, and were thereafter attacked by a mob throwing stones, and armed with other offensive weapons, and that some of the said mob did seize, disarm, <HI>or beat</HI> one of the soldiers, before the pannels did fire their shots, whereby the deceaseds were slain.”</NOTE>: The jury found the exculpation proved; and the
pannels were assoilzied.</P>
<P>A MORE noted case than any of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> owing to the differ∣ent
opinion which was entertained of it in the supreme
and inferior Courts, is that of Macadam and Long, a cor∣poral
and private soldier, tried in the Court of Admiralty,
on the 25th September 1735, for the murder of Hugh Fra∣ser,
younger of Belnain. According to their defence, the
occasion of the slaughter was as follows. They were quar∣tered
at Inverness, and were called by the revenue-officer,
to go on board the customhouse boat, to assist him in his
duty. They were ten men in all in the boat, of whom five
were armed; and in the course of their expedition they
came up with a boat, in which was Fraser and other ten
persons more, with a cargo of smuggled goods on board;
but excepting one, who had a pistol, all of them provided
with cudgels only. Words ensued between the parties; and
Fraser, followed by four more, one of them bearing a pistol,
leaped into the customhouse boat, and invaded the officer
and his assistants. The officer was knocked down, and his
blunderbuss thrown into the sea; the soldiers arms were
seized, and attempted to be wrested from them; and the
men themselves, in the scussle, were thrown down; in which
<PB N="313" REF="372"/>
situation one or other of them thrust at Fraser with his bay∣onet,
and killed him. On this narrative, a double plea was
set up for the pannels: that they killed upon resistance in
execution of their duty; at least that they killed in self-de∣fence,
being in danger of their lives. The Judge-Admiral sus∣tained
the plea of self-defence.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And sustains the defence of self-defence proponed by the pannels, that the killing of the said Hugh Fraser by the pannels, or either of them, was in the necessary defence of their lives; and repels the whole other defences proponed for the pannels.”</NOTE>, and repelled the other; and
the pannels were in consequence found guilty, and condem∣ned
to die; the jury being of opinion, “that the killing
of the said Hugh Fraser was not in the necessary de∣fence
of their lives.” Now, on review in the Court of
Justiciary, this sentence was suspended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5. 1735.</NOTE> and for the reason
announced in these words: “Fand, that the said Judge hath
committed iniquity in restricting the defences proponed
for the suspenders to the necessary defence of their lives,
and repelling the other defences proponed for them; and
therefore the said Lord Justice-Clerk and Lords Commis∣sioners
of Justiciary did suspend the interloquitor on the
relevancy, verdict returned by the assize, and sentence of
death pronounced by the said Judge, with all that had fol∣lowed,
or might follow thereon, <HI>simpliciter.</HI>” On the 20th of
the same month, in pursuance of their petition, and the Lord
Advocate's consent, the pannels were discharged from cus∣tody,
upon caution found to answer to any charge which
might be brought against them. But they were not again
indicted.</P>
<P>THERE are two precedents more, worthy to be obser∣ved;
the case of Henry Hawkins, July 17. 24. 1769, and
the case of Macfarlane and Firmin, February 4. 1788. Haw∣kins
<PB N="314" REF="373"/>
was on guard with his party, as corporal, at the
guard-house of Glasgow, where a rabble attacked them with
staves and stones, and after hurting several of the party, at
length beat down and cut Hawkins; who therefore drew his
bayonet and slew Hyndman, a butcher, the person who had
beat him down. The jury found him not guilty; in which
they had the approbation of the Court.</P>
<P>THERE was the like concurrence of opinion in the case of
Macfarlane and Firmin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty,</NOTE> which was this. Macfarlane was
an officer of excise, and had carried Firmin, a corporal of
the 39th regiment of foot, and his party along with him, by
water, to a village named Denoon in Ayrshire, there to
seize certain unlicenced stills. This purpose they so far ac∣complished,
as to deposit one still in their boat, under the
care of one only of the boatmen, who had been left there in
the charge of it. By this time the village was alarmed;
and the inhabitants rising against them in numbers, as they
were proceeding in their search, assailed them with stones,
and compelled them to desert the service, and retire towards
the beach. Meanwhile, one Kennedy, the man whose still
had been seized, was at the boat before them; leaped into
it, knocked down the boatman, and was proceeding, with
all speed, to put off from shore. At this moment, Firmin,
observing that the populace still continued to press them to∣wards
the water, and that in this way only they could re∣tire
in safety, took aim at Kennedy from some distance, and
fired and killed him; and thus they made good their seizure
and their retreat. At calling the libel against these pan∣nels,
the Lord Advocate restricted it to a charge of culpable
homicide only. But the jury were of opinion that the slaugh∣ter
<PB N="315" REF="374"/>
was <HI>inculpable,</HI> and found a verdict of <HI>not guilty</HI> in fa∣vour
of both the pannels.</P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> notice shall be taken of the case of Wood∣west
a soldier of the 37th regiment of foot, tried at Glas∣gow,
before the Lords Justice-Clerk and Henderland, in
April 1792. This man was upon duty as centinel at the
goal of Glasgow. A brawl had taken place upon the street,
hard by his post, between certain striplings on the one part,
and two soldiers and a woman on the other, who being mo∣lested,
and pelted with stones, took refuge in a sort of entry
or passage, behind his post. In this situation the rabble, many
of whom were boys, but came to be mingled with grown men,
continued to throw stones, and to threaten them with vio∣lence;
they also insisted with the centinel either to turn out
the soldiers and the woman from their place of refuge, or
to let the populace come upon his post, and pass his centry-box,
and execute their will on the objects of their displea∣sure.
The centinel refused to do either; and then they
began to annoy him in the same fashion with stones and
mud; abusing him likewise with foul names, and pressing
close in upon his post. He, in return, advised them to keep
off, and warned them that he should be obliged to fire, if
they persisted. The throwing of stones continued however
for some minutes, notwithstanding that, in the course of this
time, he endeavoured to deter them, by making preparation,
as if to charge them with his arms. At last, when many
of the rabble had pressed so close upon him as to be within
a musquet's length, he made ready, and, after waiting a
moment, fired. The shot took place and killed a boy. It
appeared upon the trial, that though several stones had
hit his arms, the man himself had never been struck, nor
<PB N="316" REF="375"/>
his person in any degree been injured. But on the other
hand, it was given in evidence, that it was part of the orders
of every centinel to keep his post clear, and his person free
of all risk of surprise, or of seizure of his arms; as also to quell
every manner of disturbance raised against him on his post,
and to protect any person, who should take refuge there in
a situation of distress. The Judges were agreed, that though
the term might not appear in our proceedings, yet the thing
itself of justifiable homicide was well known in the law of
Scotland; and that the case of a centinel who kills in de∣fence
of his post, where he is unlawfully and without pro∣vocation
assaulted, and which he cannot leave without or∣ders,
is a case of that description. The pannel had a ver∣dict
of <HI>not guilty,</HI> and was dismissed <HI>simpliciter</HI> from the bar.</P>
<P>IN answer to these numerous and uniform precedents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Captain Porteous.</NOTE> re∣ference
may perhaps be made to the noted case of Captain
Porteous, tried on the 19th July 1736. The general outline
of this case is well known. That he, being Captain of the
city guard of Edinburgh, and having in that capacity to at∣tend
the execution of one Wilson a smuggler, who was fa∣voured
by the people; and a tumult being raised after the
man had hung on the gibbet for some time, with the view,
as was supposed, of cutting down the body and taking pos∣session
of it, in order to use means for its revival; and in
the course of this attempt the city guard being assaulted
with stones; he, Porteous, gave orders to his men to fire,
and also fired himself among the people; whereby seventeen
persons were killed or wounded. The jury found a special
verdict in these words: “Find it proven, that the said John
Porteous, pannel, fired a gun among the people assembled at
the place of execution, and time libelled. As also, that he
<PB N="317" REF="376"/>
gave orders to the soldiers under his command to fire,
and upon his and their so firing, the persons mentioned in
the indictment were killed and wounded. And find it
proven, that the pannel and his guard were attacked and
beat by several stones of a considerable bigness thrown
amongst them by the multitude; whereby several of the
soldiers were bruised and wounded.” Upon this verdict
Porteous had sentence of death. On application to the
Crown, execution was ordered to be respited; and it was
believed that this order might probably be the fore-runner
of a pardon. But such was the rage excited among the
populace by the prospect of his escaping the punishment
which they thought due to his crime, that joining in a vast,
yet well concerted tumult, they for the time made them∣selves
masters of the city; and having broken into the goal,
conveyed their victim from thence to the common place of
execution, where they sacrificed him to their revenge, with
many circumstances of outrage and cruelty.</P>
<P>BUT between the case of Porteous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Captain Porteous.</NOTE> and any of the pre∣cedents
which have been cited on the other side, there is
this material circumstance of distinction; that the assembly
on which the slaughter was committed, was not an illegal
and criminal, but a lawful, and (as it must be esteemed)
even laudable assembly, in which by far the greater part of
the persons present were innocently and properly met, and
neither in truth were, nor could in law be held, participant
of the evil purposes of those among them, who came there
with intent to rescue the convict. Now to <HI>justify</HI> the firing
upon a multitude of this description, would have required
higher provocation than that which is mentioned in the ver∣dict,
and far more favourable circumstances of delay, warning,
<PB N="318" REF="377"/>
and forbearance, than were necessary in any of the other
cases, or than this unfortunate pannel could allege. The
tumult had not been of long continuance, at the time when
he gave order to fire; and this he did without authority
from the magistrates of the place, who were at hand to be
consulted on the occasion. Neither does it appear that he
ever warned the people to desist, or gave notice of his
intention to fire, or allowed time for the peaceable and
well disposed to withdraw themselves from the danger. The
fire too was not directed to that quarter only, from which
the stones were thrown; and stepping out of his proper duty,
Porteous acted the part of a private soldier, and was him∣self
the first to discharge his piece. Certainly, in these cir∣cumstances
his conduct could not be fully <HI>justified.</HI> Whether
his offence might not properly have been referred to some
of the lower species of homicide, if the jury, in their ver∣dict,
had stated all those favourable circumstances for the
pannel which the proof warranted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was <HI>admitted</HI> on the part of the Crown, that the magistrates, in the fear of a rescue, had given orders to the guard to load, before proceeding to take charge of the convict; and that a body of the King's forces had been called into the city, and assurance given them of permission to fire, if they were attacked. Farther, it seems to be <HI>proved,</HI> that before the order to fire, the convict's body was actually cut down by the mob; that the guard were pressed upon and thrown into disor∣der; that the executioner was cut in the face with a stone, to the effusion of his blood; that a drummer was cut in the head to the effusion of his blood, and his drum beaten to pieces in the same way; that a soldier of the guard had his shoulder-blade broken; and that the pannel himself was struck with a stone, be∣fore he fired. The verdict does not state any of these things, and the Court could not consider them. But even upon what is found by the verdict, it has not to every person seemed clear, that the case fell to be construed a case of murder.</NOTE>; nay whether there was
not even room for this construction upon the verdict as re∣turned;
and whether, upon the whole case, there might not
be just cause for interposition of the royal mercy, to mitigate
<PB N="319" REF="378"/>
the sentence, are different questions; and perhaps are not so
clear against the sufferer as one would wish them to have been.</P>
<P>PERHAPS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Samuel Mathews.</NOTE> reference may also be made to the case of Sa∣muel
Mathews, tried in August and September 1721, for the
murder of Thomas Boyd. Mathews was one of a sergeant's
party of twelve, who had orders to patrole the streets of
Edinburgh, on account of tumults, which were apprehended
at the time. At the port of the city, called the Netherbow,
and in a lane adjacent, (Leith-wynd), the party had met
with abuse of words and other annoyance: It was even al∣leged,
(but the proof of this entirely failed), that a shot was
fired at them from among a rabble within the gate and city∣wall.
In return, Mathews and other two fired without or∣ders,
and Thomas Boyd was killed. His defences were re∣pelled,
and the jury found him guilty; but sentence was
prevented by a pardon. That which seems chiefly to have
weighed in this case, was the circumstance of firing without
orders from the commanding officer, and indeed against his
injunction. For it was stated, and appears to have been
true, that when certain of the men levelled, the sergeant
struck up their pieces, and led off the party into another
street, (the Canongate); upon which Mathews and two
more broke their rank, and turning towards the port, di∣rected
their fire that way.</P>
<P>YET,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Soldier acting without Orders.</NOTE> though it may be generally, it is not without ex∣ception
true, that a soldier can only be justified for that
slaughter, which he does upon the order of his superior offi∣cer;
for it may happen him to be beaten down, and to be
in instant danger of losing his arms, before his officer can
interpose, either to assist or direct him. In like manner, it
<PB N="320" REF="379"/>
is generally true that an officer and his party, called to as∣sist
the civil magistrate in the quelling of a tumult, must
wait his orders to act against the rioters, and shall not be ex∣cused,
how great soever the commotion, if they proceed with∣out
that authority. Yet, if beside persisting in the original
purpose of mischief, (as to which, until the magistrate autho∣rise
them, the soldiers are but as so many individuals), the of∣fenders
shall proceed to assault, and outrageously to abuse the
soldiers themselves, so as to put them in plain hazard of being
driven from their post, or of losing their arms, or being dis∣abled
for the service; certainly, as men and as soldiers, they
have right to defend themselves from these injuries, with∣out
leave of the magistrate, who is blameable that he does
not permit them. Being brought thither at his instance,
the whole party are here in the same situation as a cen∣tinel,
and cannot retire until he dismiss them; neither,
any more than the centinel, are they to remain there, to
be made prisoners, or to be maimed and disabled. In
case of attack made on them on any other occasion, and
when under command of their own officers only, this
would be their undoubted right; and certainly it is not
the less so, that they are here attending in aid of the ma∣gistrate,
who owes protection to them equally as to the
rest of his Majesty's subjects, and the more to them, as they
have been brought by his act into this situation of danger.
It is to be observed, that neither in the case of Willhouse, nor
of Macadam and Long, was there any order on the part of
the revenue-officer, to repel the attack by force.</P>
<P>6. THE officers of revenue form another class of per∣sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Revenue-offi∣cers</NOTE>
whose situation, for reasons of the same kind as that
of the officers of justice, demands allowance of peculiar
powers towards the deterring and overcoming of that
<PB N="321" REF="380"/>
resistance, to which, from the nature of their duty, and
the lawless character of those against whom they have
to act, they are, perhaps, more exposed than any other of
the servants of the State. Their duty is, withal, of great
importance to the public, to be performed with activity and
zeal, and cannot be done with effect, unless instant advan∣tage
be taken of the opportunities of seizure, as they hap∣pen;
besides, that the persons who oppose them therein are
criminals, not only in the opposition which they make, but
in the very act which they endeavour to protect by this re∣sistance.
In justice, therefore, to the men, the Legislature
has made provision towards the better protection of their
persons, and appointed very high pains for such who shall
molest, oppose, or hinder them, in their office<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The offences of this class are treated in the chapter which relates to those crimes that are injurjous to trade.</NOTE>. And thence,
at common law, would result a corresponding privilege in
them, instantly to quell such resistance by the necessary
means, and make good their service at the hazard of the op∣poser<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>On the 15th March 1784, Alexander Reid, excise-officers, was indicted for murder, and pleaded two defences. 1. Exercise of duty, being invaded when con∣veying goods which he had seized. 2. Defence of his own life, which was in danger. The verdict was <HI>not guilty.</HI> But as the depositions are not in the re∣cord, I cannot say upon which of these grounds the acquittal proceeded.</P>
<P>Gilbert White, indicted for murder, July 2. 29. 1776, pleaded, that he was re∣sisted and assaulted in an attempt to seize run goods. The interlocutor was in the ordinary general style. The verdict was <HI>not proven.</HI> It appears from the depositions in the record, that the pannel and another, armed with swords were opposed to four smugglers, some of them bearing staffs, and that White was beaten, and also cut in the hand, in attempting to make the seizure.</P></NOTE>. But that which would have been implied at common
law, has not been trusted to this security, but is declared by
express clause in the statute, 9th of Geo. II. c. 35. which
<PB N="322" REF="381"/>
authorises the officers of customs or excise, and their assis∣tants,
when resisted in the searching for or seizing of goods,
by persons who are passing with the same, armed with of∣fensive
weapons, “to oppose force to force, and to endea∣vour
by the same methods that are violently used against
them, and by which their lives are endangered, to defend
themselves, and execute the duty of their office:” In
doing which, if any person shall be killed, and the officer or
his assistant shall be prosecuted, he may plead the benefit of
the statute. In truth, this direction is nothing more than
declaratory of the powers which arise to the officer <HI>vi juris,</HI>
(and on the same principle as already explained in the case of
the officers of justice), from the command of the law to him
to make the seizure. For if the smuggler oppose him there∣in
with mortal or offensive weapons, whereby the officer
<HI>shall come</HI> to be in danger of his life, if, as by the law en∣couraged,
and in duty bound, he shall <HI>advance</HI> and persist
to make his seizure; he must needs have right to quell this re∣bellion
by employment of the necessary means, and cannot
be answerable for any mischief that ensues. This statute is
virtually confirmed by a later one, that of the 24th Geo. III.
c. 47. which has made it punishable with death, to wound,
or even to shoot at, any officer of the navy, customs, or ex∣cise,
(or his assistants), acting in the execution of his duty.
It follows, that the officer, in such a case, who has thus a ca∣pital
felony committed against his person, has right to per∣sist,
at the utmost peril of the criminal, in the prosecution of
his lawful object.</P>
<P>BESIDE these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Revenue-offi∣cers.</NOTE> which are cases of resistance by persons
who are in the act of smuggling, there are many other si∣tuations
<PB N="323" REF="382"/>
of interference between the revenue-officer and the
lieges, with respect to which it would much exceed the com∣pass
of our enquiry, if we should attempt to settle, How far he
can be justified in the use of force, upon the resistance or re∣fusal
of what the law entitles him to demand. But in ge∣neral,
it seems to be true of those numerous entries and visi∣tations,
which the Excise laws have ordered in regard to
certain manufactures, and the sale of certain articles, and
whereof the refusal exposes to very high pecuniary penal∣ties,
that the Legislature has not meant to authorise the use
of force, and has made the penalties so high, for the very
purpose of hindering any recourse to it, and of outweighing
any possible profit which the dealer can have by his disobe∣dience
to the law. It is also to be remembered, that the
offenders in this way, are not, like smugglers, needy and
desperate persons, or strangers, who must be quelled upon
the spot, but persons domiciliated in the country, and pos∣sessed
of effects here, which, as well as their persons, are
accessible to the law, for punishment of their trespasses.</P>
<P>III. I SHALL not enlarge farther on this part of our sub∣ject;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de∣fence of Life a∣gainst a Felon.</NOTE>
of which sufficient has now been said, to give a general
notion of the principles by which it is governed. But it is
necessary to examine that sort of homicide also, which is
justifiable upon necessity of a private nature, or out of duty
to one's self. The most indisputable instance of this class,
is slaughter committed in the necessary defence of one's own
life, against an attempt feloniously to take it away. I say
against a felonious attempt to murder; for I am not at pre∣sent
speaking of that self-defence, which may become neces∣sary
in the course of an affray, or occasional quarrel, be∣tween
persons who have fallen out upon the spot, and, in the
<PB N="324" REF="383"/>
beginning, are probably, both of them, more or less in fault.
Those two kinds of self-defence are not grounded in the
precise same reasons, nor subject in all respects to the same
construction; nor indeed are they attended, in every in∣stance,
with the same benefit of an absolute and entire justi∣fication.
One difference between them is, that to enjoy the
plea of self-defence, as upon an occasional quarrel, the sur∣viver
must have given back, and done all that in him lay,
to take himself out of the affray, without shedding the blood
of his antagonist. But it were unreasonable to exact the
same temperance and <HI>moderamen tutelae</HI> of him, who being on
the high-way, and alone, is suddenly thrust at from be∣hind
by an assassin, or has a pistol fired in his face, by one
who springs out upon him from the side of the way, with
intent to murder. There is in such a case no manner of
possible or imputable wrong on the part of the person as∣sailed,
for which he should make amends by retreating:
In duty to himself, he is rather called on, instantly, and
without shrinking, to stand on his defence, that the assailant
may not continue to have the advantage of him, but be ter∣rified
from the farther prosecution of his felonious purpose.
To what greater lengths he may carry the attempt, or
what other means he may have prepared to accomplish his
end, a person invaded in this sudden manner cannot know,
nor is obliged to consider in such a moment. He is entitled
to suppose the worst of that which has been begun in so base
a fashion; and, by the law of nature, has therefore right to
put himself in security by the only certain means, the in∣stant
slaughter of the assailant; who is no true man, that
his innocent victim should contend with him on equal terms,
but a great criminal, taken in the commission of a known
<PB N="325" REF="384"/>
felony, and the fit object, therefore, of immediate and sum∣mary
justice.</P>
<P>IT seems also to be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de∣fence of Life a∣gainst a Felon.</NOTE> that the right of slaughter on such
occasions is not confined to the person himself who is attacked,
but is common to him, (which never can be true of self-de∣fence
upon a quarrel), with his friends or servants, or others
who are along with him. Nay, it may even be maintained,
that though the assailant give back on the resistance, yet the
innocent party is not for this obliged immediately to desist,
(since it may be only a feigned retreat, in order to call as∣sociates,
or to renew the assault with better advantage), but
may pursue and use his weapons, until he be completely out
of danger.</P>
<P>HAVING accomplished this object, how far he has right
still to pursue the offender onward, for the purpose of taking
him and bringing him to justice, and to kill him if he will
not be taken, is a question which seems to hinge upon this
other, What powers has an officer of the law for the same
purpose? For whatsoever powers the officer hath by reason
of his station, the same hath the party in this case by reason
of his certain knowledge of the offender, and the present
opportunity of bringing him to justice. In general, it is
obvious, that all the powers which he possesses, belong to
him for the ends of justice only, and in nowise for those of
resentment or revenge. So that if he kill the criminal
after he is secured, or after he is reduced to such difficulties
that he cannot escape, or may probably be taken alive, it is
at least a culpable homicide; and if there has been any in∣terval
for reflection, it may even amount to murder. For it
matters not how vile or mean the person slain, if he is killed
out of deliberate cruelty, or revenge. These observations I
<PB N="326" REF="385"/>
only offer as my own sentiments; which are not indeed con∣tradicted
by any thing in our practice, but have not the au∣thority
of any judgment of a court of law. Indeed, I cannot
find, that any proper case has ever happened for the illustra∣tion
of this sort of self-defence. And the other is so much a
more frequent situation in practice, that the lawyers not of
this only, but other countries, have chiefly directed their at∣tention
to it, and have formed their general precepts re∣specting
the duty of self-defence, with a view to it alone.</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in hinderance of Rape.</NOTE> as a man may kill in resistance of an at∣tempt
on his life, a woman also hath right to kill in resist∣ance
of that injury to her honour, which cannot be repair∣ed
if it be committed, and of which she is entitled to feel the
highest resentment. By parity of reason, the husband or
the father of a woman thus invaded, has right to feel the
like resentment, and to defend her from this extreme and
cruel injury, at the hazard of the invader.</P>
<P>THE right of resistance unto death is not however li∣mited
to cases of attempt upon one's person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de∣fence of Pro∣perty.</NOTE> but equally ap∣plies
to invasion of one's property, if it be made in that
forcible and felonious manner, which naturally carries
fear along with it. I say in a manner which is at once
forcible and felonious; for I conceive that the right fails,
if either of these circumstances be wanting. It may be a
high, and even a capital crime, to pick a person's pocket of
large sums of money, or to steal his linen to a great value
from the hedge. But he certainly shall not be justified, if
instead of seizing he instantly stab the pick-pocket, on dis∣covering
what he is about, or if he shoot the thief from be∣hind
the hedge, before he know that he is detected.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="386"/>
AS little will the force be sufficient, if it is not of a cri∣minal
or felonious nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de∣fence of Pro∣perty.</NOTE> but a trespass only, or other low
offence. A few instances will illustrate this matter. It
will not be lawful for me to kill my neighbour, who per∣sists
to search for game upon my lands without my leave; or
who, on a mistake of our marches, shall poind and carry off
my cattle pasturing on my grounds, in the belief, though
grossly wrong, that the grounds are his. Or what if he
come at the head of his servants and people, to throw down
a dike or other bulwark within my property, or to throw
open an alleged common, about which there is a controversy
between us? In any of these cases, since the trespass on the
property is not coupled to an assault on the person, (for if
it were otherwise the question would be far more delicate),
it is grounded in the highest justice, that the blood of the
assailant cannot be shed, to prevent the injury. For neither
is there the same depravity on his part, nor the same trepi∣dation
and alarm in the person assaulted; as well as there is
no cause to believe that the trespasser will fly from justice,
on account of such a fault, or that full amends may not be
had in course of law. But it is quite otherwise if I am at∣tacked
on the high-way, under night, and in a solitary place,
to be robbed. This injury can only be accomplished by
subduing my person, and I have reason to dread all sort of
violence on refusal, or even delay to comply; nor am I
even sure to be exempt from it, though I deliver: besides
that, if once surrendered, my property is lost, with but little
chance of recovery at any after time. Meeting in this man∣ner,
the assailant and I are therefore in a state of open war∣fare,
in which I have no terms to keep with him, and am
under no obligation in law, whatever compassion may sug∣gest,
to consult his safety, but may prevent and chastise his
felony upon the spot.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="387"/>
ACCORDING to all authorities, that of the Mosaic and
the civil law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of a House-breaker.</NOTE> as well as our own custom<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Exodus, c. 22. v. 2. &amp; 3.; l. 9. dig. ad leg. Corn de sicariis; Stat. 2da. Ro, I. c. 30.</NOTE>, and indeed ac∣cording
to the express permission of the statute, 1661, c. 22.
one is also justified in killing him who breaks into one's
house in the night, to steal. But though this be the example
given in these authorities, it would not be reasonable to un∣derstand
them in a restricted sense, such as would limit the
privilege to the case of an attempt to steal only; but rather
as grounds, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> for authorising the same course of re∣sistance
of him, who breaks into the house to commit mur∣der,
or rape, or haimesucken, or to set the house on fire.
Nor is it even necessary that the felon have carried his as∣sault
so far, as clearly to show which of these several fe∣lonies
was in his purpose; if either he has entered the house,
or has broke the safeguard of the building, so that he may
enter when he will, and is in the act, or immediate prepa∣ration,
so to do. Because this is an assault of so bold and
deliberate a nature, and in which the invader has already
so much the advantage, as warrants those within to dread
the worst designs, and such as are not to be prevented but
by superior force; as well as that all they can do upon this
sudden alarm is no more than sufficient to put them on an
equal footing with the felon, who comes cool and prepared
for the enterprise. Tenderness for the life of another may
indeed suggest to make trial, by cries and otherwise, to de∣ter
him from his purpose, before proceeding to the use of
higher means. But how commendable soever this generosity
in those who have sufficient presence of mind to employ it;
still it is what the law cannot absolutely enjoin, or hold a
<PB N="329" REF="388"/>
person to be culpable for omitting. The main consideration
in all such cases is the alarm, surprise, and danger of the
true man, who at the hour of rest, and in his place of surest
refuge, finds his safeguard broken on a sudden, and his per∣son
within the power of a felon, who has thus a favourable
opportunity to accomplish his purpose, and escape unknown.
In these circumstances, he may always be said to be within
the protection of that text of the Roman law, which al∣lows
the killing of the nightly thief, “<HI>si parcere ei sine suo
periculo non potest;</HI>” for there is always hazard, more or
less to the inhabitant of the house, from an assault which
has already been carried this length with success.</P>
<P>IN regard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of a House-breaker.</NOTE> again, to those cases, where the strength and
safeguard of the building are still unbroken; it may rather
be esteemed the duty of the inhabitant, being himself in
safety at the time, to use all natural and gentler means for
scaring the invaders from the prosecution of their purpose.
And certainly he shall not be free of blame, (some have
thought that it may even amount to murder), if, instead of
following this course, he purposely keep quiet for a time,
and deliberately take aim at the thieves, standing with∣out,
and kill them; or if he knowingly suffer them to
enter the house, and post himself in a safe and conve∣nient
station, from which he kills. For in this course of
conduct he rather shows a desire of the blood of the in∣dividual,
than to prevent his own injury or danger. But
it will deserve a very different construction, if, instead
of taking flight upon alarm raised within the house, and
means used to scare them, the invaders shall despise these
warnings, and openly persist in their purpose to force an en∣try.
This would even be the most favourable of all situ∣ations
<PB N="330" REF="389"/>
to those within, who are thus assured of the most vio∣lent
intentions, if entrance shall be obtained, and must there∣fore
defend themselves, by any the most effectual means, so
long as they have it in their power.</P>
<P>IN the case of one who steals in the day-time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of <HI>Fur diurnus.</HI></NOTE> there are
plain and substantial reasons, why more caution should be
observed. It was accordingly the precept of the Mosaic law,
“If the sun be risen upon him, there shall blood be shed
for him.” The law, also, of the Romans, seems only to
have permitted the killing of the <HI>fur diurnus</HI> “<HI>si telo se de∣fenderit.</HI>”And in our statute 1661, c. 22. there is no special
excuse set down, but of homicide committed upon thieves and
robbers, breaking houses in the night. These authorities are
however rather to be received, as applicable only to the or∣dinary
case of invasion of one's property in the day-time;
which being that the danger may be warded off without re∣course
to those ultimate means, they are therefore forbidden
to be used. But in this, as in every other enquiry, in cri∣minal
matters, consideration must always be had of all the
circumstances of the situation. And that a person who is
assaulted in the open air, to be robbed, or whose house is fe∣loniously
attacked, in order to be riffled or burned, or to
commit a haimesucken on him;—that he is obliged in any
case, or at any hour, rather to suffer this great wrong, which
the law punishes with death, than to hinder it, if it can no
otherwise be done, by killing the invader; or that law has
received any presumption so contrary to the truth, as that
this cannot be necessary against an attack in the day-time;
any of these things, it is neither reasonable in itself, nor
agreeable to the analogy of the rest of our practice, to be∣lieve.
In solitary and remote situations, where there is little
<PB N="331" REF="390"/>
use of passage, or likelihood of relief, there may be no
other means of defending one's property. And if this were
not itself a sufficient reason; how is the owner to know that
the ruffian who assails in this open fashion will be con∣tent
with his effects, and not endeavour, as in the day-time
he is strongly tempted, to take his life too, that he may not
prosecute, or bear evidence against him?</P>
<P>THOUGH they are not so probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of <HI>Fur diurnus.</HI></NOTE> yet cases may even be
imagined, to justify the slaughter of the felon, though the
first abstraction was of a secret and proper theftuous nature.
Put the case, that a person on foot, and at a distance from
any habitation or resort of passage, meets a thief riding off in
all haste upon his horse, which he has stolen from the field.
If he call to him to stop, and instead of complying, if the thief
continue the more hastily to ride away, whereby he will soon
be out of the reach of the owner's pursuit, or of any hue and
cry that he can raise against him, there seems to be no law
which should hinder him to save his property in this necessity,
though at the expence of the felon's life. “<HI>Unde sequitur,</HI>”
says Grotius, “<HI>si ad jus solum respicimus, posse furem, cum re∣fugientem,
si aliter res recuperari nequeat, jaculo prostrari; nam
quae inter rem et vitam est inequalitas illa, favore innocentis, et
raptoris odio compensatur</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. c. 1. No. 11.</NOTE>.” It is not a sound argument,
that is drawn to the contrary from the provisions of our
statute, 1662, c. 6. which directs a certain course for the
pursuit of thieves and depredators, by application to the
nearest magistrate, and raising the <HI>posse</HI> of the parish, and
declares the killers free of challenge, if in this pursuit any
of the thieves be slain. For this whole ordinance relates to
the situation “after the away-taking of the goods,” and
<PB N="332" REF="391"/>
cannot be construed as in derogation from any power
which arises to the owner at common law, for maintaining
himself in the possession.</P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Self-defence.</NOTE> HITHERTO of homicide committed in defence against
any attempt to perpetrate <HI>a felony</HI> on goods or person. But
the more ordinary situation of self-defence, is that where
the motive of the invasion is not so foul, nor so deliberate,
but lies in some misbehaviour of one or other of the parties,
some offence of word or deed, real or conceived, which has
kindled anger on the spot, and led to the mortal strife.</P>
<P>NOW, with respect to all slaughter committed on such oc∣casions,
it is the doctrine of the law of England, grounded
in its tenderness of the life of man, that it will not hold
the surviver entirely guiltless, but will rather presume that,
which it cannot always investigate, but which must often
be agreeable to the truth, namely, that the surviver was in
some measure to blame, and in a greater or less degree
brought the assault on himself. On conviction, therefore, of
slaughter <HI>se defendendo,</HI> the prisoner is not simply acquitted,
but has sentence of forfeiture of moveables, against which
he has a pardon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 187. 188.</NOTE> and writ of restitution of his goods, as a
matter of course and right.</P>
<P>OUR practice again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Self-defence.</NOTE> in this more lenient, but I shall not
say wiser than that of England, has not received any such in∣variable
presumption against the surviver, but investigates
the fact in each case as it happens; and in judging of the
pannel's plea, requires such a course of conduct to his en∣tire
acquittal, as bears earnest of his peaceable disposition,
and sincere aversion to shed the blood of his fellow-creature.
That is to say, in all cases where it appears that either in the
<PB N="333" REF="392"/>
origin or the progess of the quarrel, or in the ultimate strife,
there was any thing faulty or excessive on the part of the
surviver; there, for the sake of correction and example, the
Judge will inflict a suitable punishment on him, though it be
true that he killed out of no wickedness or malice, but only
to save his own life, and in the genuine belief that he could
not otherwise escape. This last part of the rule, beside that
it is grounded in reason and uniform custom, is declared by
the statute 1661, c. 22. which in the case, among others, “of
homicide in lawful defence,” protects the slayer against
the capital pain, but declares it lawful to imprison him, or
to inflict a fine on him, to the use of the relict or chil∣dren
of the deceased.</P>
<P>THE general description of slaughter in self-defence, is,
that it is committed from necessity; in the just apprehension,
on the part of the slayer, that his own life cannot otherwise
be saved, and without alloy of any other less excusable
motive. But this description will require to be particularly
analyzed.</P>
<P>1. AND first the pannel must have killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killer must be in Danger of his Life.</NOTE> <HI>to save his life.</HI> For
it will not bring him within the benefit of this plea, however
the case may be as to others, that he killed to avoid some great
indignity, or even some bodily harm; if it be clear that this
and no more was what he had reason to fear. If, for in∣stance,
he kill to avoid being kicked down stairs, or upon
attempt to horsewhip him, or roll him in the kennel, he can∣not
be fully justified: because, how painful soever such in∣juries
to the feelings both of mind and body, they still are
not mortal operations, nor attended with any immediate
danger of death; so that they amount only to a plea of great
provocation, which will not in any case completely exculpate.
<PB N="334" REF="393"/>
Thus, in the case of John Macmillan, sentence of death was
given upon a verdict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1690.</NOTE> which implies that the pannel had re∣ceived
repeated strokes of a staff or baton<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The jury sind the defunct Thomas Grierson of Bargaltown, was killed by the pannell's sword, in the pannell's own hand; and find that defence of the pannell's, that the defunct run himself upon the pannell's sword, not proven; and likewise, find the stick deponed upon, not such a baton or staff as might brain or kill the pannell, <HI>especially seeing all the stroaks the defunct gave the pannell therewith,</HI> did not so much as draw blood of the pannell.” Sentence of death was given, August 21. 1690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the case also of Peter Maclean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. and Mar. 1. 1710.</NOTE> a soldier, indicted for
the murder of John Ewan, by firing his carabine at him, it
was found only relevant to restrict to an arbitrary pain,
that he had been abused with foul names, her Majesty re∣viled
in his presence, and his own person assaulted, to de∣prive
him of his piece<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the indytment relevant to inferr the pains of death; and sustained the defence proponed for the pannell in these terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That the defunct quarrelled the pannell under the name of rascall, how he durst carry a fowling-piece, and that if the Prince had his own he durst not do so; and ad∣ding these words, that her Majesty was but a whore, and thereupon assaulted the pannell for taking his carabine from him, relevant to restrict the lybel to an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.

these injuries, pleaded as amounting to self-defence, were

<P>AS appears from this case of Hardie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killer must be in Danger of his Life.</NOTE> it will not even be
sufficient that the injury is of that kind, which by long con∣tinuance
may come to kill, or do a mischief from which
death may ensue. The assault must already have continued
so long at the time of killing, and have been conducted
in such a manner, as puts the sufferer in imminent and
present danger of his life, and shews the assailant's pur∣pose,
not to be satisfied with less than his destruction. One,
for instance, who is carried to the river and ducked, may
by this abuse contract a fever, which may prove mortal; or
the operation may be so often repeated, or so unmercifully
conducted, as to destroy the person on the spot. Yet neither
of these hazards will justify him in repelling the outrage
with death in the beginning. In like manner, a school-boy
may die of the consequences of excessive correction; or he
may be so cruelly scourged as to expire under the master's
hands. Yet if he draw a knife and stab the master on the
first excess, were it even a great excess, he shall certainly be
liable to punishment; or it may be that he is even guilty of
<PB N="336" REF="395"/>
murder. Matters, in short, must have come to the situation
<HI>morti proximum,</HI> in which the sufferer has a reasonable and
instant dread of death, before he can justifiably shed the
blood of the aggressor, to put an end to the assault. In this
view it probably was, that in the interlocutor upon the case
of David Pretis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. &amp; 26. 1730.</NOTE> the Court made use of very special terms,
and such as are exclusive of any lower danger than has now
been described. He pleaded, that the deccased had assault∣ed
him in his own house; had dragged him from thence,
cut him in the head with some sharp instrument, and beaten
him to the ground. But instead of adopting these allega∣tions,
the Court had thought it safer to find in general thus:
“But for eliding the foresaid relevancy, sustain this de∣fence
to the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> that his wounding of the defunct
was in self-defence, while the pannel was by the defunct's
invading of him put under the imminent hazard of his
life.</P>
<P>IT is not sufficient that the pannel have killed out of ap∣prehension,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Opinion of Danger not suf∣ficient.</NOTE>
though in him ever so genuine, of danger to his
life, if it was not also a reasonable apprehension, and well
grounded in the circumstances of the situation. In a matter
of this kind, the law cannot entirely pardon any vain terror
or sudden panic; for against this, so far at least as concerns
his conduct towards others, it is the duty of every man to be
on his guard. Neither can it have consideration to that extent,
of an excessive timidity of temper, (which is a blameable ha∣bit
and ought to be corrected), nor of any gross misapprehen∣sion
of the nature of the assault; because it will always be
supposed that by due caution and attention such misfortunes
may be avoided. If therefore one kill a person who makes an
attack upon one in sport with a foil; or if one mistake some
<PB N="337" REF="396"/>
harmless instrument for a pistol presented at one's head, and
kill the supposed robber or assassin, some censure must ne∣cessarily
follow. Allowance there may be for such unfor∣tunate
mistakes, since the deceased himself cannot be ac∣quitted
of indiscretion, in that he made this seigned assault;
but it cannot go the length of justifying the slaughter, which
is not done on any real danger of the pannel's life, but
on a false and hasty opinion only to that effect.</P>
<P>THIS position is in some measure illustrated by the case of
Captain John Price and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Opinion of Danger not suf∣ficient.</NOTE> indicted for the murder of
John Reid corporal of the town-guard of Glasgow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24. 1690.</NOTE> Their
defence was thus: that being in a tavern, they were abused
by the people of the house, and were afterwards assaulted
by a multitude, who gathered in front of the tavern, and
attempted violently to break in on them; which obliged
them to barricade the doors, and have recourse to arms.
In the mean time the guard arriving, and making open the
doors, if any of them was shot by the pannels, this (they
said) was done ignorantly, and in the belief, excusable in
such a state of trepidation and disorder, that the guard were
part of the mob, continuing their assault on the house. These
allegations were found only relevant to restrict the libel to
an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 26. 1690. “The Lords find the lybel, anent the slaughter of the deceast John Reid, and the pannells their being art and part there of, by each of them their stricking at the guard, resisting or opposing them, or having drawn swords or pistolls in their hands, relevant to infer the pain of death; as also that defence, that the pannells were assaulted by the rable, who cryed fire upon the dogs, or the like expressions, before audible intimation was made that the guard was come up, relevant to restrict the lybel, anent the slaughter, to an arbitrary punishment; but they find the duply, that the pannells were advertised of the guard's being at the door, and required to open to them, so as they might hear the same, relevant to elide the said defence <HI>simpliciter.</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="397"/>
IT is equally obvious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fear of Death must be at time of killing.</NOTE> that the apprehension of death must
apply to the very time when the slaughter is committed.
It will not bear out the plea, that in the beginning the sur∣viver
is taken at a disadvantage, and at one period of the
contest is “<HI>in periculo constitutus,”</HI> if he has ceased to be
so before the fatal blow is given. John suddenly draws,
and pushes at James, who draws in his defence, but gives
back without thrusting, till he is forced against a wall,
where he must either fight or die. If in this situation he
kill, it is self-defence. But if at this moment John, ma∣king
a thruft at James, happens to fall, and the sword flies
out of his hand in the fall, and is broken; or if James, at
this time, by a lucky hit disarms John, whose sword is
tossed to a distance; and if instead of using this opportu∣nity
to escape, or to make himself master of John's sword,
James shall follow up the accident with repeated thrusts at
John, thus disarmed, and kill him; he has at least lost his
pretensions to the plea of self-defence, however the case may
stand as to any other. Or suppose that James, being put to
the wall, has thrust and wounded: if upon this John retires,
and James advances on him; and John retires still farther, and
James continues to advance thrusting at him, and at last kills;
here also he cannot be justified. The case of Edward Da∣vies,
as it turned out on proof, seems to have been of this
description; though I cannot for certain affirm whether it
was judged on this or on another ground. Davies, a soldier,
was charged with the slaughter of Robert Park,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. &amp; 18. 1712.</NOTE> a country∣man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1713.</NOTE>
by running him through the body with a sword, from
back to breast. He pleaded, that the deceased, and three more,
provided with staves, had attacked and beaten him in the
street; that he retired, and they pressed on him, and cut
him severely in the hand; whereupon he called for the as∣sistance
<PB N="339" REF="398"/>
of the guard, which was near at hand, and drew and
made use of his sword. The reply was to this effect: that
any danger he had ever been in was past, since the guard
were coming up to his relief, and the aggressors were re∣tiring
at the time; and that in particular this was the case
with the deceased, as appeared from his being wounded by
the pannel in the back. Either on this footing, or on that
of high provocation, and that the pannel had never been
truly in danger of his life” the defence was found only re∣levant
to restrict the libel to an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">December 18. 1712. “The Lords find the pannel, his giving the defunct, the time and place libelled, the mortal wound with a sword, whereof he died, relevant to infer the pains libelled; and find the pannel, his being alone the time and place foresaid, and a scuffle then happening betwixt the defunct, with two or three more in his company, and the pannel, and after a beating with staves betwixt the said men and the pannel, the said pannel, his retiring and calling for the guard, and being mutilated in the hand before he gave the said mortal wound, a defence relevant to restrict the said libel to an arbitrary pu∣nishment.” The jury, Jan. 26. 1713, found, That there was proof of the slaughter, and none of the deceased having been in the scuffle. Upon which the pannel had sentence of death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. THE self-defence must not only be genuine in this sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not Self de∣fence, if Killer can escape other∣wise.</NOTE>
that the killer is assaulted to the danger of his life, but it
must be just and <HI>necessary</HI> also; the one refuge which the
killer has from this high peril of his person. That is to say,
the plea will not be good in those, not unfrequent situations,
where the pannel has other ways of escape from the assault,
or the certain and easy means of putting an end to it, but
out of pride, or humour, or some false notion of dishonour
in the thing, chooses rather to stand and repel the violence,
than have recourse to them. One for instance, who is as∣saulted
at mid-day, on the street, where he may easily re∣tire,
<PB N="340" REF="399"/>
and find shelter among the bystanders, or otherwise; if
instead of doing so, he deliberately wait to receive the on∣set,
and will not give back; he cannot allege that he kills
purely to save his life: he kills to indulge his temper, or
for the sake of his opinion, which, in the estimation of the
law, is a false and a wrong opinion, and one which he must
be taught to abjure in time to come. I may here quote the
words of the interlocutor on the libel against Captain James
Bruce and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1. &amp; 2. 1691.</NOTE> indicted for the murder of Simpson and
Linklatur, two soldiers of the city-guard of Edinburgh.
They pleaded, that they were violently assaulted by the
guard, when drinking the King's health at a bonefire on the
street. But this defence, the Court repelled “unless the
pannels prove, that before the killing of Henry Linkla∣tur,
they were (by the guard's aggressing them), put in
present danger of their lives, <HI>and could not otherwise escape.</HI>”
In the case also of John Macmillan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1690.</NOTE> where the assault was
alleged to have been made in the like situation, one of
the circumstances which the jury find, and on which the
Court proceed to give sentence of death is this, “that he
might with ease have made his escape, so as to save his
life without drawing his sword.” On the same prin∣ciple,
one who will stand a mortal assault, rather than ren∣der
himself to the officers of justice, because he is innocent
of the matter that is laid to his charge, or because they mis∣take
him for another man, (which error he observes, and
fullenly declines to explain), is, by this vice of temper, or
unsoundness of head, reduced to a far more difficult and
more unfavourable plea than self-defence. These are things
in which it is his duty to comply. He ought to yield though
he be innocent; and he deals most unfairly, and even cruel∣ly
with the officer of justice, not to inform him of his mistake.
<PB N="341" REF="400"/>
It would be easy to put many other cases of a like nature, in
which, though the surviver is not the first to assault, yet he
kills out of a necessity (if it may be called so), which is oc∣casioned
by his own will, and choice of a course of conduct.
I shall only farther explain this matter, (if I may be allowed
to use so familiar an illustration), by what is related, (and I
believe is true), of some noted sword's-man, who laid claim
to the sole privilege of walking upon certain boards of the
floor of the coffee-room which he frequented. This pre∣tension
had long been submitted to; but was at last wittingly
and deliberately disputed, by a gentleman, who fought with
this usurper on the spot, and killed him on his own do∣maine.
Certainly, it cannot be thought that the place suffer∣ed
a great injury in the loss of such a member of society.
Yet, in a trial for the homicide, this champion of the pub∣lic
right could hardly have had the benefit of the plea of
self-defence. For, in substance, the case was much the same
as if he had appointed to meet his antagonist in that place,
and to fight purely for possession of the spot. In short, in all
cases of this description, the surviver shows nothing of that a∣version
to shed the blood of his neighbour, which is a necessa∣ry
ingredient of the plea of self-defence; but rather a sort of
quarrelsome obstinacy, which courts and invites the assault.</P>
<P>3. TO have the benefit of a full and entire justification,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moderamen in culpatae Tutelae;</HI> what it is.</NOTE>
the pannel must have observed the due temperance and re∣serve,
(<HI>moderamen in culpatae tutelae,</HI> as it is termed by lawyers),
in conducting his defence. The meaning of which is, that
with respect to the weapons employed, the season and the
way of using them, and in all other particulars, he must have
confined himself to that just degree and measure which were
requisite towards his own safety, and have done what in
<PB N="342" REF="401"/>
him lay to take himself out of the strife, without shedding
the blood of the invader. For if in any of these points
there have been excess or precipitation on his part, some
reprehension proportioned to the error will attend it; true
though it be that he was in danger of his life at the time of
killing, and struck the mortal blow for his own protection,
and not out of any malice or revenge. Thus with respect to
weapons. One is suddenly invaded and beaten with a club,
poker, or the like dangerous weapon, by a person of supe∣rior
strength, and in a chamber from which he cannot rea∣dily
escape; and in this situation, to save his life, he draws
his sword and kills. It is however proved, that he might
have found in the apartment the like weapon to that with
which he was attacked; or that by cool and skilful manage∣ment
of his sword, he might have made good his retreat
from the chamber, without sacrificing the aggressor's life.
That he has done otherwise, may, and, with the aid of the
proper circumstances in evidence, will be presumed, to have
been owing to the alarm and trepidation which are natural
on such an occasion, and not to any cruel or malignant pur∣pose.
But though this disorder of spirits be sustained as
an excuse to him; still it is in some measure a blemish in
his conduct, and deprives him of the benefit of an absolute
and entire justification.</P>
<P>IT is in this sense that we are to understand the interlocutor
in the case of John Govan,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Excessus Mode∣raminis.</HI> Feb. 20. and Mar. 3. 1710.</NOTE> which finds the pannel liable to an
arbitrary punishment, at the same time that it implies him to
have been in danger of his life. “They find the libel relevant
to infer the pains of death; and sustain the defences propo∣ned
for the pannel in these terms, <HI>viz.</HI> that the pannel was
attacked by the defunct and his associate with opprobrious
<PB N="343" REF="402"/>
words, and beating of him, so that he was necessitat to fly
and betake himself to his house, and the defunct with his
associate returning and invading the pannel in his house,
and there renewed the scuffle by beating of him, and the
pannel, <HI>in dread and fear,</HI> laid hold on a sword for his
defence, endeavoured to repel the violence, and force
them out of his house, and that during the continuance of
this scuffle, the pannel gave the defunct the deadly wound,
either in the house, at the door of the house, or before
the door, relevant to restrict the libel to an arbitrary pu∣nishment.”
Probably, this is also the just construction of
the interlocutor in the case of John Macmillan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1690.</NOTE> Macmil∣lan
had killed Grierson, by stabbing him in the belly with a
sword. He stated in defence, that Grierson had set upon and
beaten him with a great staff, to the danger of his life, which
obliged him to draw his sword; and that Grierson's servant
then laid hold of and stopped him, till Grierson struck him
several violent blows more. The interlocutor was thus:
“And as to the qualification of self-defence, find that de∣fence,
that the pannel was assaulted and beaten by the de∣funct,
with such a great batton or rung, as might have
brained or killed him, and could not get fled, nor save his
life otherwise, <HI>than by drawing his sword,</HI> after he was so
assaulted, relevant to liberate the pannel from capital pu∣nishment,
but prejudice of inflicting an arbitrary pain,
as accords.” Now the words of this judgment are to
be attended to. If they had been, that the pannel could not
save his life <HI>without stabbing the deceased,</HI> certainly the judg∣ment
would have been unjust in subjecting him to any
punishment at all. But the hypothetical state of facts,
to which the interlocutor applies an arbitrary punishment,
is only this, that he could not escape <HI>without drawing his
<PB N="344" REF="403"/>
sword;</HI> which leaves the case open to this construction, that
by the due management of that weapon, against a person at∣tacking
with a staff, he might have secured his retreat, with∣out
striking a mortal blow.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise excess in the <HI>degree</HI> of the violence by
which the pannel has warded off the danger of his life; if
out of extreme fear and agitation, he has continued it long∣er,
or has done more, than was absolutely necessary to dis∣able
the invader.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1685.</NOTE> In the trial of Urquhart and Webster for
the slaughter of Simpson, it was urged in behalf of Webster,
(for Urquhart was alleged to have had no concern in the
violence), that the deceased had bruised him with a large staff
or baton, thrown him to the ground, and trodden upon him
to the danger of his life. In reply, the prosecutor allowed
the relevancy of this plea, but observed, that there was at
least an <HI>excessus moderaminis</HI> on the part of Webster; as he
had brought Simpson to the ground with a blow of a staff,
and had afterwards so bruised and abused him, as to break his
ribs, and occasion death. The Court find the libel relevant
to infer the pain of death; “sustain the answer of self-de∣fence
relevant to elide the dittay; and find the reply of ex∣cess
relevant to take off the defence.” An ambiguous ver∣dict
was returned; and the issue was, that in terms of the sta∣tute
1661, both pannels were decreed in a certain sum to the
relict and children of the deceased, and were ordered to
goal, during the pleasure of the Court.</P>
<P>AGAIN as to time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Excessus Mode∣raminis</HI> as to time.</NOTE> If John is in the act of drawing his
sword on James, and James rush in upon and kill him be∣fore
it be fully drawn, there is here also a precipitation and
excess, for which the killer shall be answerable to the law.
Yet it may nevertheless be a just case of self-defence. For
<PB N="345" REF="404"/>
let it be supposed that the deceased was a noted swordsman,
and of superior strength to James, and a man too of a known
cruel temper, and that he had posted himself by the door of
the chamber, so as to hinder James from escaping; certainly
James was in plain jeopardy, and had good reason to dread
the worst. Yet, as there is an apparent precipitation on his
part; a departure, in some measure, from that strict and scru∣pulous
caution, which the law would recommend and en∣join
in so interesting a particular; he cannot be dismissed
entirely free of censure or rebuke. In another sense, any
excess in the article of time, seems to be scarcely recon∣cileable
to the just notion of self-defence. This is, where
the slaughter is not instant upon the attack or danger, but
at some interval of time. For in this situation, at least if
the interval is of any length, the deed can only be at∣tributed
to the principle of revenge; which always makes a
case of murder. With this in some measure coincides the
excess in point of place; which is, if the pannel beat off
the assailant, and pursue him any considerable way in his
retreat. In either of these situations it is not an <HI>excessus
inculpatae defensionis,</HI> or nimious violence in defending, but an
<HI>excessus defensionis</HI> simply; an act of aggression, and an entire
departure from the defensive line of conduct.</P>
<P>TOUCHING these several modes of excess,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitation of the <HI>moderamen tute∣lae.</HI></NOTE> it would be a vain
attempt, (though not untried by the Civilians), to reduce
them, and the different possible combinations of them, under
a few general and invariable rules. By the very nature of
every such question, it is a question for the consideration
of the jury, and which must be resolved on a complex
view of the whole case; wherein regard is had not of
this or 'tother article only, which <HI>prima facie,</HI> or gene∣rally
<PB N="346" REF="405"/>
speaking, may be accounted unfavourable to the pan∣nel,
but of all and whatsoever those circumstances of the
situation, which may reasonably be supposed to have affect∣ed
him at the time. And one consideration there is on
his part, which ought always to be duly weighed; as in∣deed,
unless this be done, the foregoing rules would circum∣scribe
his plea within too narrow bounds. I mean the dan∣ger
to himself, from too great tenderness to the invader,
or an excessive backwardness in defence; the effect of
which may be, that he loses the proper season of defending
himself to advantage, or with effect. Thus, though it be a
point of duty to retire from the assault; yet this is always
to be received under provision that the assault be not so hot,
as makes it difficult to retire, and so that in retiring the
person do not materially encrease his own danger, or put
himself to a plain disadvantage for conducting his defence:
As if he have to retire down a dark or steep stair-case, or
by passages better known to the invader than to him. On
the same ground it cannot be exacted of him, to wait till the
pistol is in the very act of being fired at him; or if the
enemy have drawn, and be rushing towards him, he may
meet him with his fire, before the point be at his breast.
This seems to be allowed by the judgment in the case of
Captain William Barclay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 12. 1668.</NOTE> of which Mackenzie gives some,
but rather an incorrect account. The interlocutor is in
these words: “The Justices repels the haill defences and
qualifications proponit for the pannells in respect of the
reply; and finds that the qualification of self-defence is
relevant in this case, that the defunct Sinclair or his ac∣complices
were the first aggressors, without any just pro∣vocation
given by him, and that he woundit the pan∣nell's
<PB N="347" REF="406"/>
brother or servants, and thereafter <HI>pursued the pan∣nell
with a drawn sword or bended pistol.</HI>”</P>
<P>IN like manner, it is generally true that one is not to use
a mortal weapon against that which is not mortal. Yet this
also has its exceptions. If two persons set upon one and
invade him, the one with a sword, and the other with a
staff, which the latter uses to disconcert him in his defence,
so that he may be laid open to the assault of the former; is
it to be doubted that the ordinary rule of measuring wea∣pon
against weapon is set aside, and that he has right with
any weapon, or in any the most speedy way, to dispatch this
base and insidious assistant?</P>
<P>4. EVEN when all these considerations unite in sup∣port
of the pannel's plea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Killer occasioned the Assault.</NOTE> as relative to the moment of killing,
they may however be accompanied with one circumstance
more, which shall hinder them to work his absolute juscifi∣cation
and acquittal. This is, if in any degree the pannel
has himself been the cause of the fatal strife. John and
James deliberately appoint to fight with mortal weapons;
and in the course of the combat James is wounded and re∣tires,
and calls to John to desist; which John refuses, and
follows up his advantage so hotly, that James, purely to save
his life, is at last constrained to kill. If, as seems more pro∣bable,
this is not even a case of murder, at least it gives no
room for the proper plea of self-defence; because the dan∣ger
and necessity are the act of John himself; are the result
of a situation, which he has deliberately courted. In the
case of Robert Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Self-defence in cases of Duel. Aug. 4. 1673.</NOTE> it was even judged to be murder
in the surviver, notwithstanding the more favourable plea,
that on <HI>coming to the field</HI> he earnestly declined the com∣bat<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“So that <HI>esto argumenti causa,</HI> he had gone to the craigs with him, yet ha∣ving repented him on the place, it was lawful for him to have resiled; like∣as, <HI>de facto,</HI> he did resile and refused to fight; but being forced thereto by the defunct, it was necessary for him in his own defence to draw his sword.”</NOTE>,
<PB N="348" REF="407"/>
and was threatened, and abused, and drawn upon by
the deceased; so that he had no choice, but was necessitated
to defend his life: And of these things he offered proof.
But, though urged to the effect of alleviating only, this de∣fence
was disregarded; and the libel alone was remitted to
the assize<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Finds the indictment relevant, notwithstanding the defence and duply, and remits the same to the knowledge of an assize.” I have not found that this prosecution came to any issue: the diet was continued from time to time.</NOTE>. Much less, therefore, will the excuse serve, if
the parties have gone to the field, though in heat of blood,
and on a sudden quarrel, and have fought fairly, without ei∣ther
of them giving back or declining the strife. By our
practice, this is nothing less than murder; as was determi∣ned
in two cases, after full debate on the question.</P>
<P>THE first is the case of William Mackay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 17. 1670.</NOTE> and was shortly
thus. Mackay, a taylor, being in the castle of Edinburgh,
had quarrelled with a soldier who was in company with him,
drinking; and blows had passed between them. Mackay
said to the soldier, that he durst not fight him, or use him
so, if they were beyond the gates of the castle. They
then left the castle together, and went to the city, and got
swords, and from thence proceeded to the fields (the King's
Park), where they first fell to blows, and afterwards drew
and fought fairly; and the soldier was killed. In these cir∣cumstances,
Mackay, beside denying the challenge, offered
to prove that the deceased was the aggressor, and drew on
him, and obliged him to defend his life. The prosecutor an∣swered,
that he would prove the challenge and appointment
<PB N="349" REF="408"/>
stated in his libel. The Court repelled the defence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Repels the defence proponed for the pannel, as the same is alleged complex∣ly, and ordains the dittay to be put to the knowledge of an assize.” The libel was laid both on the statute against duels and at common law.</NOTE>, and
the pannel was convicted and condemned to die.</P>
<P>THE other case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Self-defence in Cases of Duel. June 10. &amp; 11. 1678.</NOTE> that of James Gray, was that of combat
between two persons who quarrelled in a tavern, and left their
party with a purpose to fight; and fought accordingly hard
by the house. The defence and libel were both remitted to
the jury<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel relevant, and that there is no necessity of any distinct probation for proving precogitate malice, and remits the libel,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As also, “They find the exception of self-defence <HI>simply proponed,</HI> relevant, and refuses to grant precognition upon the qualifications and circumstances mention∣ed in the defence.”</NOTE>, who found, “That the pannel did commit the said
slaughter upon the defunct Archibald Murray, and that
with one vote; and as to the second part, <HI>relating to the
pannel's self-defence,</HI> they find no such thing proven; but on
the contrary, <HI>that the pannel and defunct came both out from
their company, most likely upon one and the same design.</HI>” The
pannel had sentence to lose his head.</P>
<P>IN the case of an appointment to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Killer gave Pro∣vocation.</NOTE> the parties are
on the same footing, and equally in the wrong. The same
rule of judgment will therefore <HI>a fortiori</HI> apply, where∣soever
the surviver was himself, in the main, the provo∣ker
of the quarrel, and by his own misbehaviour excited
that resentment, against which in the end he has found it
necessary to defend himself, by the slaughter of his antagonist.
Upon words between John and James, John strikes a blow;
whereupon James draws and assaults John; who also draws,
<PB N="350" REF="409"/>
but retires, defending himself, as far as he can; till being
put to the wall, he is at last necessitated to kill, having no
other means of escaping the danger. This slaughter cannot
be accounted less than culpable homicide, being the result of
a necessity, which the surviver has occasioned by his own
wrong; a wrong for which, even if it had not been attend∣ed
with so fatal an issue, some atonement on his part would
have been due, and much more where it ends in the destruc∣tion
of the injured person. Judgment went upon this ground
in the case of the Master of Tarbat and others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 18. &amp; 19. 1691.</NOTE> These
persons were charged with the murder of Elias Poiset, a
French gentleman, whom they had met in a tavern, by run∣ning
him through the body with a sword. They gave this
account of the matter for themselves: that the deceased,
along with his brothers, George and Isaac Poiset, and an∣other
Frenchman, the Sieur de la Massie, had entered the
hall of the tavern where the pannels were sitting by the fire,
and there attacked them with swords and pistols; which ob∣liged
them to kill in self-defence. It was set forth in reply,
(and in part it was admitted by the pannels), that they had
previously intruded into George Poiset's chamber, where
he was in bed, and had abused his person; and that after
being turned out, they had again alarmed and disturbed him,
by beating on the chamber-door. Accordingly, the defence
was found only relevant, to restrict the libel to an arbitrary
punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the defence, that the slaughter was committed in self-defence, rele∣vant in thir terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That after the said pannels, in the first libel, came out of George Poiset's chamber, and after their second attempt, by beating and raping at his chamber-door, and that they were set down peaceably at the fire∣side, the defunct and his brethren, and Mr de la Massie, came into the room and assaulted the pannels, by presenting cocked pistols to them, or thrusting at them with drawn swords, before the pannels made any violent opposition to them, relevant to restrict the libel to an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="410"/>
IN the case of any assault, as above imagined, of a vio∣lent
or painful nature to the person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Killer gave Pro∣vocation.</NOTE> there seems scarcely to
be room for difference of opinion. But neither ought it
to turn the scale in favour of the pannel, that he did
not assault to hurt the body, but in some of those other
ways, which argue less of anger than contempt, and for that
very reason, at least among persons of a certain rank, are
perhaps only so much the more difficult to be endured. The
case of Lieutenant Robertson may be consulted with rela∣tion
to this point.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin's Cases, No. 68.</NOTE> Upon the whole case <HI>as proved,</HI> there may
be no reason to think that much injustice was done by the
general verdict of acquittal. Yet the Court could not pro∣perly
have given an interlocutor on his defence, as relevant
to exculpate; because, though grossly insulted and reviled,
he had himself been the immediate author of the com∣bat,
by a contumelious assault on the person of the de∣ceased;
having risen from the table where he was writing,
and having crossed the room, and pulled the deceased by the
nose.</P>
<P>THERE does not even seem to be any good reason, why he
should not be liable to the moderate correction of fine and
imprisonment, appointed by the statute 1661, who brings the
assault on himself, by the provocation of contumelious words,
or derisive signs and gestures. However blameable so ardent
a temper in the deceased, and though it would have been
murder in him, if, in revenge of the taunt, he had instantly
killed the reviler; yet, as the event has happened, this per∣son
cannot be held free of blame, who knowing that temper,
applied such incentives to it, or if he knew it not, was
<PB N="352" REF="411"/>
rash enough to make so dangerous a trial of what it might
prove to be. Though his words were not a provocation to
justify, or even to excuse the killing of him, and make it less
than a capital crime; it does not follow that they are there∣fore
no wrong at all, and insufficient even as a ground of
censure on the speaker, being himself the surviver, and the
slayer of the very person, to whose resentment (within
certain bounds), his insolence had justly exposed him. If
the law of England, without enquiry, presumes a wrong in
the surviver, in every quarrel which issues in homicide <HI>se
defendendo,</HI> we certainly will go the length of attending to
any actual, though but verbal wrong, that is proved against
him.</P>
<P>I HERE conclude my enquiry concerning homicide in self∣defence,
the last species of that homicide, which is termed
justifiable, and does not expose to any sort of correction.
In explaining it, I have necessarily introduced some instan∣ces
of another sort of homicide, of which we are next to
treat, namely, culpable homicide, which implies blame in
the killer, and is followed with punishment, more or less
considerable, according to the quality of the fault.</P>
<P>V. CULPABLE HOMICIDE appears to be of several kinds
and degrees; which are grounded in different reasons.</P>
<P>1. IT has been said, and does not stand in need of farther
illustration, that it is culpable homicide, where slaughter
follows in the doing even of a lawful act; if it be done without
the due caution and circumspection for preventing injury to
others.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="412"/>
2. IT has also been said, that it falls under the same
consideration, if death ensue on the doing of an unlawful
and prohibited thing; such as the discharging of fire-arms,
or the throwing of stones or fire-works in the streets of a ci∣ty,
or the whipping of a horse there, so that it springs for∣ward,
and kills a passenger.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD case of culpable homicide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi∣cide by Misad∣venture.</NOTE> also incidentally
taken notice of, and which may sometimes stand higher in
the scale of guilt than either of the others, is where death
ensues by misadventure, without the intention of the killer,
and in an unforseen and unlikely manner; but withal on a
purpose to do some sort of bodily harm to the deceased.
If John and James, persons of equal years and strength,
happen to quarrel, and John strike James a single blow
with the hand, which unhappily kills him; or if John
thrust James aside, and James slipping a foot fall to the
ground, and have his skull fractured, and in consequence
die; in either of these cases the death is an extraordinary
casualty, such as no one who strikes in that fashion can
fairly be presumed to have intended, or to have thought
of as a probable or even possible event. Yet as John is
blameable, in that he uses any manner of violence to the
person of his neighbour, and would be liable to some censure
even on that account, if nothing more happened; and as
his neighbour has actually died of this violence; so, for the
sake of example, and the satisfaction of the public, as well
as of the relations of the deceased, he shall, within cer∣tain
bounds, be answerable for the mortal consequence,
which it will here, without much enquiry, be presumed
that nothing but great indiscretion on his part could oc∣casion.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="413"/>
Many cases might be cited in illustration of this
part of the law. I shall confine myself to the following.</P>
<P>WILLIAM MASON was indicted for the murder of William
Ralston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Death on a Purpose of slight Injury. July 13. &amp; 29. 1674.</NOTE> by beating him and throwing him against the
sharp corner of a chest, or chair; whereby he was wound∣ed
in the temple to the effusion of his blood in great quan∣tity;
of which injury he died. The pannel stated sun∣dry
pleas, such as self-defence, casual homicide, and that
the wound, of itself, was not of a mortal nature; all
which, as well as the libel, were sent to the assize. But the
Court were of opinion, that even as laid in the libel, the
charge was not of that nature, which implied either a
mortal or a highly injurious purpose to the person of
the deceased; and they therefore found it only relevant
to infer an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds the libel as it is libelled, only relevant to infer <HI>poenam extraordina∣riam,</HI> and remits the same to the knowledge of an assize; and also remits the defences proponed for the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> That of casual homicide, self-defence, and that the wound was not of itself mortal, likewise to the knowledge of an assize.” The assize found, “that what was committed by the pannel was in self-defence.” He had sentence to pay the sum of L. 247 Scots to the widow of the deceased.</NOTE>. The like relevancy was found
upon the charge against William Bathgate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2. &amp; 23. 1710.</NOTE> where the man∣ner
of the death was set forth to have been by beating the
deceased and throwing him to the ground, but without men∣tion
of any weapon used against him, or of any wound in∣flicted
on his person<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>“The Lords find the libel as libelled only relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and sustain,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as formerly quoted.</P>
<P>On the circuit at Aberdeen, in September 1792, this verdict was returned against George Sellar. “Find it proven, that at the time libelled the pannel George Sellar did strike the deceased Robert Paterson a blow on the head with a check or clip, and that Robert Paterson died in consequence of that blow: But find no proof of malice against the pannel, and recommend him to the mercy of the Court.” He had sentence to be imprisoned for six months.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="414"/>
I SHALL next cite the trial of John Graham, for the mur∣der
of John Russell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Death on a Purpose of slight Injury.</NOTE> After relating that the deceased had
met the pannel and his son on the highway, driving cattle,
and that without any provocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. &amp; 8. 1727.</NOTE> they with opprobrious lan∣guage
and threats, ordered the defunct <HI>to go off,</HI> the libel
proceeds thus; “and the said John Russell then running off
was beat by the said John Graham elder and his son, or
pursued and chaced by him and his said son John, with
sticks or staves, or other mortal and offensive weapons, on
horseback, and wounded to the great effusion of his blood,
and obliged by force and violence, or terror and fear of
their cruelty, to run into the water of Nith; which with
the violence of the stream carried him down, so that at
some distance he was found dead.” Now here was a
plain abuse of Russell's person, which issued in his death.
And yet, as related in the libel, the assault could hardly be
said to justify a charge of murder; since Russell rather ap∣peared
out of excessive fear and terror to have thrown him∣self
into the stream, than to have been under any necessity of
doing so, to save his life. At least this was the view in which
the matter had occurred to the Court. For though they
found a capital relevancy on the general and concluding
charge, that at the time and place libelled the deceased was
murdered, and that the pannel was art and part thereof; yet
with respect to the above facts related in the libel, they were
of a different opinion, and found as follows. “<HI>Separatim</HI>
find, that he the pannel, time and place foresaid, did either
by himself, or by hounding out his son, pursue and give
<PB N="356" REF="415"/>
chace to the defunct with sticks or slaves, and thereby
forced him into the water of Nith, wherein he perished,
and thereafter was found dead, relevant to infer an arbi∣trary
punishment.” The jury found the libel not proved.</P>
<P>I FIND a fourth illustration in the case of Gaspar Rey∣sano,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Death on a Purpose of slight Injury. Dec. 7. 18. 19. 1724.</NOTE>
an Italian, who was charged with the murder of Ro∣bert
Lamb, by throwing him backwards down stairs; where∣by
he received a wound in the head, of which he died<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“Did upon the 25th, or one or other of the days of August last, without any just provocation, wilfully and violently throw the said Robert Lamb, who was then lodging at your house in the Canongate head, over the stair of your said house, upon which he fell and received a wound or bruise upon his head, near to his right ear, or upon some other part of his body, whereof he died next day, or soon thereafter.”</P>
<P>On the 7th of August 1741, Lillias Brown was indicted for the murder of Mary Mitchell, “by forcibly pushing or slinging her headlong down the stair of her own house, whereby she received a wound in her head, and a fracture of her arm, or wounds or fractures one or more on some part of her body, of which, or of a fever and mortification thereby contracted, she died in a few days thereafter.” This woman was banished Scotland for life on her own petition, on the 13th August, after informations recorded on the case.</P></NOTE>.
It appears that the stairs were winding, or (as they are pro∣vincially
called), turnpike-stairs, and that the deceased, who
was much in liquor, had fallen backwards down seven or
eight steps at the foot, so that his head lay out at the thresh∣old.
On the whole circumstances of the case, as shown in
the libel, the Court had been of opinion, that though the
pannel was criminal in pushing or striking the deceased in
so hazardous a situation, yet he could not be held to have been
actuated by a mortal purpose. They therefore found the libel
only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain. And on convic∣tion
<PB N="357" REF="416"/>
in the precise terms of the charge, he was adjudged to
be transported for life<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>December 14. “The Lords find the libel relevant only to infer an arbitra∣ry punishment, and repel the defences against the said relevancy, and remit,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>December 19. “The jury find it proven by concurring witnesses, that Gas∣par Reysano, pannel, did upon the day libelled, or thereabout, throw the de∣funct from the door of the said Gaspar Reysano's dwelling-house, backwards, down the stair, by which fall the defunct received a bruise or wound on the head or right ear, whereof he died next morning.”</P>
<P>In March 1721, Hugh Sandilands, a lad of fifteen, who had killed his fellow-servant, a grown man, with one stroke of a dung-fork, was indicted for murder; and informations are recorded on the case. He was afterwards transported on his own petition. I say so on authority of a note written on the printed papers. For the case drops out of the record.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>VERY analogous to this, but brought to an issue favour∣able
to the pannels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. 1769.</NOTE> was the case of Thomson and Aberdeen,
who were charged with the murder of William Michie, thus.
“He was met or attacked by the said Andrew Thomson and
Alexander Aberdeen above complained on, who, or one
or other of them, without provocation, either pulled or
pushed the said William Michie from off his horse, where∣by
he fell upon the pavement, and either fractured his
skull, or bruised the same so much, that he expired in the
afternoon of the day following.” This libel was found
only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain. And the pannels
were saved even from this, by a general verdict of ac∣quittal.</P>
<P>A CASE somewhat different from any of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Death on a Purpose of slight Injury.</NOTE> as to the
mode of the intended mischief, was tried at Perth on the 29th
September 1784. Henry Inglis, and Andrew and Robert Col∣villes,
were charged with culpable homicide, in having
<PB N="358" REF="417"/>
mixed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or some other hurtful stuff, with spirits, or some
other liquor, and administered it to a certain person as a
draught; in sport probably, or at worst meaning to make
him sick. The libel was found relevant as laid; but the
proof was defective, and the pannels were acquitted.</P>
<P>IF the law be so in these cases, it seems to be no less rea∣sonable
that the same judgment should pass upon a woman
who deserts and exposes, and thereby kills her infant child;
though she do it in a way not likely to destroy the child, as
by the side of a highway, and in the day-time. For still she
does a very wrong thing, and subjects the child, more or less,
to the hazard of what may happen. But of this more fully
afterwards.</P>
<P>IN the same view notice may be taken of the situation of
a preceptor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Ma∣ster killing Pu∣pil by Correc∣tion.</NOTE> who has been so unfortunate as to destroy his pu∣pil,
by excessive correction of his person. By reason of the
favour and privilege of his situation, this severity shall or∣dinarily
be ascribed to the due motive; but it is not there∣fore
to be entirely pardoned, being so great an intem∣perance,
and in such a person, but shall only save him from
the pains of murder. Nor shall he be saved even from
these, if the excess be so great, as can only be imputed
to special malice, or a cruel disposition: as if by invent∣ing
extraordinary ways, or using dangerous and unusual
instruments of discipline, he furnish evidence of his de∣praved
will. And of this opinion our Judges had been in
the case of Robert Carmichael,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1. 8. 10. 16. 19. 1700</NOTE> on the excesses as charged
in the indictment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“They find the indictment, as it is so declared and amended, relevant to infer the pains of death; and find any of the qualifications libelled in the in∣dictment, death immediately following, relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to infer an arbi∣trary pain.” January 15. 1700.</P>
<P>The verdict is in these words: “Find it proven that the pannel did three times, <HI>ex incontinenti,</HI> severely and cruelly lash and whip the defunct upon the back and hips, and in rage and fury did drag him from his desk, and did beat him with his hand, upon head and back, with heavy and sore strokes, and af∣ter he was out of his hands, he immediately died; and finds it likewise pro∣ven, that after the defunct's death, the side of his head was swelled, and blue marks seen thereupon, with several marks of stripes, from the small of his back to his houghs.”</P></NOTE>; though on the facts as found in the
<PB N="359" REF="418"/>
verdict, the culprit escaped with a very gentle (I had almost
said a nugatory) sentence. Indeed, many have thought
that even on the verdict there was room for a more se∣vere
construction. Whether the pannel had firmly resolved
to dispatch his victim on the spot, (as in truth he did dis∣patch
him), will not determine his guilt; for clear it is,
(which often amounts to the same in law) that he meant to
do him a dangerous, excessive, and outrageous bodily harm,
and commited such flagrant abuse of his person, as showed
an absolute and complete indifference about him, whether
he should live or die.</P>
<P>I SHALL now dismiss this article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is the <HI>animus occidendi</HI> presu∣med in such Cases.</NOTE> after observing, with
respect to the presumption on the subject, whether it be that
the pannel meant death, or some great mischief, or only
some inferior injury, that no general rule can be laid down,
which shall be very serviceable in practice, or shall not be
liable to frequent exceptions. It may seem reasonable, in
the case of a blow or two struck with the hand, or with some
ordinary and seemingly harmless implement, that the pre∣sumption
shall be in favour of the pannel, that he was not
actuated by a very injurious purpose. But even this is only
generally true, and entirely fails in the case of a stout and
<PB N="360" REF="419"/>
grown man, who smites a woman, or a boy, or an infant, or
an aged and very infirm person, in that manner, and with
all his might; a mode of assault as likely to prove mortal
to such a one, as in the case of one of his own years it is, if
he strike him with a stone or a club. Nay, the very words
uttered by the pannel on the occasion, if they be very ma∣lignant
and rancorous, and more especially if there have
been waylaying of the deceased, and previous threats of
destruction, may be expositive of the intent in such a man∣ner,
as to maintain the prosecution for murder, though com∣mitted
with a very unlikely weapon. Accordingly, dittay
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1664.</NOTE> without hesitation, sustained against Malcolm Brown,
miller in Lenox-mill, for killing William Stark, a young
boy, by striking him a blow on the ear with the hand; where∣by
he became instantly deaf, and languished for some time,
and died. The pannel maintained only this defence, that
the boy died of some other ailment; and on this ground it
probably was, that he had a verdict of acquittal.</P>
<P>THERE is thus no just and general rule but one, that the
intent must be gathered from the whole circumstances of the
case; by the Court, when judging of the relevancy, accord∣ing
as the story is related in the libel, which at that period is
held for true; and by the jury, according as the fact ap∣pears
upon the evidence. With respect to which, even
though the pannel bring no proof in exculpation, such <HI>indi∣cia</HI>
(or <HI>tokens</HI> as they were once called) may appear on the
prosecutor's proof, as shall justify the jury in acquitting of
the higher offence.</P>
<P>4. I NOW pass from those cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi∣cide on Provo∣cation.</NOTE> where the homicide is in
this sense accidental, that it happens without the intention
of the killer, to those, certainly more criminal cases, where
<PB N="361" REF="420"/>
the killer has a mortal purpose, and yet is not in the first
degree of guilt as a murderer: for this reason, that he is
not stirred to the deed by wickedness of heart, or hatred of
the deceased, but by the sudden impulse of resentment, ex∣cited
by the provocation of high and real injuries, and ac∣companied
with terror and agitation of spirits.</P>
<P>TO judge such a slaughter as a pure involuntary act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds there∣of.</NOTE> like
that of a brute or a madman, which is the object of nei∣ther
praise nor blame; this certainly is a course for which
nothing of any weight can be urged. For although, along
with other animals, we are subject to the impulse of resent∣ment
on injuries, which is necessary to our preservation;
yet it is not in our species, as in theirs, a blind and ungo∣vernable
impulse, which transports us whithersoever it will;
but has been placed by the Author of our nature, under
the controul of a superior principle, which may serve to re∣strain
it within those just bounds, where it answers its pro∣per
ends; and by means of which, if duly and habitually
exerted, not only the conduct of the man on any particular
occasion may be regulated, but even the feeling itself be in
a great measure chastened and subdued: so that the very
things which are done for self-defence, shall be done calmly
and with measure, and less out of rage or animal passion, than
from considerations of justice and necessity. To gain this
state of self-command, is part of every man's duty, according
to the degree that is attainable to him, in his way of edu∣cation
and course of life; and so far to fall short of it,
as mortally to avenge any insult or injury which neither
is attended with danger to one's life, nor is impossible to be
repelled and chastised by gentler means,—this, without a
doubt, is a culpable and criminal excess, such as in any well
<PB N="363" REF="421"/>
constituted mind will be followed with long regret, and
which the magistrate cannot pass over without severe re∣prehension.
A conclusion which will only be the more con∣firmed,
when he reflects on the great frequency of such
scenes of provocation, and how prone the nature of every
man to judge too hastily, and too highly, of any wrong
which he happens to sustain. To put men therefore on
their guard in this respect, and form them, as much as may
be, to a previous habit and disposition on the subject, which
may serve as a corrective of sudden passion, the law of all
civilized countries, has condemned all homicide that is
done on provocation, though grievous, and difficult to be
withstood, as a high crime, and the fit subject of exemplary
correction.</P>
<P>BUT while we thus entertain a well grounded jealousy of
every man's partiality in his own case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of culpable Homi∣cide on Provo∣cation.</NOTE> and have a due regard
to the peace and order of society, which are so deeply con∣cerned
in the repressing of such excesses; yet, on the other
side, we cannot as men be insensible to the wide difference in
respect of guilt, between the homicide which has no cause but
in the wickedness of the killer, and that which is only in re∣taliation
of sore and alarming injuries received upon the
spot, and has thus the double excuse of bodily pain, and
perturbation of spirits.</P>
<P>IT may indeed be said, that in one point of view, there
is more need of severity applied to sudden than to wilful and
malicious homicide; on account of the greater frequency
of the inferior offence. But no more in this than in other
cases, can we, in judging between man and man, put the feel∣ings
of human nature out of question on views of policy;
or forget what the degree of perfection is, to which our
<PB N="363" REF="422"/>
constitution permits us to aspire. To keep the allowance
for the frailties of our condition within as narrow bounds
as we safely can,—this is a right and necessary course; be∣cause
by means of such discipline we may improve and be
corrected. But to have some consideration of those frail∣ties,
so as only to punish them in their degree as such, and
not in the same rank with the foulest and most odious
crimes,—this is no less a just and salutary rule; if the pu∣nishment
is meant to have its due effect as an example, and
the people to be conciliated to the course of criminal ju∣stice.
And here let me add, that those who argue for the
reception of this plea into the law, are not, as at first it might
be thought, appearing on the side of mercy. For if in
every case the manslayer is to make atonement with his life,
without regard to the provocation, however high, which
he has suffered; then may it be expected that juries will
find a general verdict for the pannel, whensoever they can∣not
reconcile this severity to their own conscience; and
thus, (as actually happened in the case of Finhaven), the
pannel shall be disinissed without even that punishment,
which his intemperance deserves. Now the allowance of the
inferior denomination of homicide, while it saves the offend∣er's
life, keeps him liable to some correction proportioned
to his fault, and maintains this sort of slaughter in its due
place in the public opinion as a crime.</P>
<P>ALL considerations, therefore, issue in one conclusion. The
invader, who offered the injury, knowing as he did the re∣sentment
which it behoved to excite, was therein guilty of
a wrong; and justly merited to receive upon the spot, a se∣vere
chastisement of his person. And though the due mea∣sure
has been far exceeded; yet it were (I had almost said)
no less excessive, to condemn this culprit to death, who
<PB N="364" REF="423"/>
has not sinned out of cruel disposition or wickedness of heart,
and is neither that object of aversion to his neighbours, nor
that same irreclaimable and hopeless member of society, as
the wilful murderer, on whom mercy and pardon were thrown
away. Punished he ought to be, that he may stand corrected,
and others be taught the lesson of patience by his example;
but there is no reason why he should seal his repentance
with his blood, which, in civilized times, neither the fre∣quency
of the offence, nor the public opinion will demand.</P>
<P>THESE seem to be the obvious and reasonable grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of cul∣pable Homicide on Provocation.</NOTE>
on which to maintain the distinction between culpable ho∣micide
and murder; the one punishable with death, the
other at the discretion of the Judge. Reference has also
been made in support of it to the Jewish law, and to the Ro∣man;
but, for my own part, I rather think, both unnecessari∣ly,
and without success. The texts of the civil law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 1. No. 3. ad leg. Corn. de Sicariis. L. 1. Cod. ej. Tit.</NOTE> seem
rather to have relation to those cases, where the slaughter
happens without intention to kill, and not to those, where the
mortal purpose may be excused. And with respect to the Jew∣ish
law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Exodus, chap. xxi. ver. 13. 14.; Deut. ch. xix. ver. 4. 5. 6.; Numbers, ch. xxxv. ver. 15. to 28.</NOTE>, th
ough some of the passages may seem to be ambi∣guous;
yet on the whole, they give countenance to this opi∣nion,
that even for a pure casual slaughter, that which hap∣pened
by accident and misadventure, without evil purpose,
the slayer stood in need of the safeguard of the sanctuary,
to defend him from the vengeance of the kindred of the de∣ceased;
and that to any but him, even the city of refuge
was no protection. And this is perhaps the natural course
<PB N="365" REF="424"/>
in the infancy of law and government, while the passions of
men are violent, and crimes are less punished on any con∣siderations
of justice or policy, than to allay the passions of
the individuals concerned.</P>
<P>BUT concerning this it is truly of little importance to en∣quire:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder and <HI>chaude melle;</HI> Distinction of.</NOTE>
because clear it is, upon the testimony of our ancient
statutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See act 1425, c. 51.; 1426, c. 89. 95.; 1469, c. 35.; 1491, c. 28.; 1535, c. 23. See also Mackenzie, Tit. Murder, No. 11.</NOTE>, that the distinction of murder and slaughter on
suddenty, or <HI>chaude melle,</HI> as it was termed, (hot quarrel, that
is, or heat of blood), had once been thoroughly established in
the practice of Scotland. Not indeed on that regular and con∣sistent
plan, which is suitable to the improved jurisprudence
of later times; but still in a substantial and efficacious form,
such as commonly answered the purpose of saving the offend∣er's
life, and which sufficiently marks the sentiments of those
times with respect to the degree of his offence, as contradis∣tinguished
to murder. It was the appointment of those
laws, that the manslayer on suddenty was to have the be∣nefit
of the girth or sanctuary: He might flee to the church
or other holy place; from which he might indeed be taken
for trial, but to be returned thither, safe in life and limb,
if his allegation of <HI>chaude melle</HI> were proved. Thus, though
the form of the relief was defective, and the application of
it irregular and uncertain, as it depended on the circum∣stance
of flying to and reaching the girth; yet still (like the
benefit of clergy in England, which had the like supersti∣tious origin), it made a material difference in the law, and
was a mark of the different opinion of the country with re∣spect
to the two modes of homicide.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="425"/>
ON the Reformation, when the privilege of sanctuary was
abolished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If abolished at the Reforma∣tion.</NOTE> this mode of relief was of course at an end. But
as to the distinction of punishment in murder and <HI>chande melle,</HI>
which had hitherto been enforced by means of the <HI>jus asyli;</HI>
whether the just consequence was that this also should be
abolished along with that institution; this at least is not so
clear a position. To those who think that the circumstance
of sanctuary was not itself the ground-work of the doctrine,
but an accident only in the external shape and mode of ope∣ration
of a precept, which is founded in the first feelings
of humanity and justice, it may rather seem, that, unless a
statute had interposed to abrogate the distinction, it still be∣hoved
to have effect in law; and that it lay with the Judges
of the land to devise some new and improved expedient,
by means of which the ends of justice might with more
certainty, and in a more consistent form, be attained. That
this was actually done, does not appear from the books of ad∣journal.
On the other hand, (though some rigorous examples
may be produced), as little can it be said that they bear testi∣mony
of such a custom of judgment, or train of precedents,
as absolutely to six the law against the merciful construc∣tion.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaude melle;</HI> if abolished by Act 1661.</NOTE> it has however been alleged, was afterwards done, by
the statute of the 13th February 1649; which falling under
the general act rescissory of the usurper's laws, was re-enact∣ed
by the statute 1661, c. 22.; and which ordinance, if
in explicit terms it abolishes this humane distinction, or,
being ambiguous, if it has been so construed by long and
uniform custom, is without a doubt decisive of this im∣portant
question. But these things are far from being past
dispute.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="426"/>
THE statute is entitled “concerning the several <HI>degrees</HI> of
<HI>casual</HI> homicide.” It proceeds upon a narrative of being
intended to remove “all doubt that may arise hereafter in cri∣minal
pursuits for slaughter.” And it enacts in these words.
That the cases of homicide after following, <HI>viz.</HI> Casual ho∣micide,
homicide in lawful defence, and homicide com∣mitted
upon thieves and robbers breaking houses in the
night; or in case of homicide the time of masterful depre∣dation,
or in the pursuit of denounced or declared rebels for
capital crimes, or of such who assist and defend the rebels
and masterful depredators by arms, and by force oppose
the pursuit and apprehending of them, which shall happen
to fall out in time coming, nor any of them, shall not be
punished by death; and that notwithstanding of any laws
or acts of Parliament, or any practick made heretofore, or
observed in punishing of slaughter.” Now, an argument is
raised upon this ordinance; that being made for the settlement
of all doubts in this matter, and bearing a full enumeration of
those cases of slaughter which shall not be capitally punished,
(cases all of them more favourable to the pannel than that of
slaughter in <HI>chaude melle</HI>), it by necessary implication, ex∣cludes
this last species, from the benefit of the privilege
therein promulgated.</P>
<P>THE main answer to this argument has been:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaude melle;</HI> if abolished by Act. 1661.</NOTE> That under
the name of <HI>casual homicide,</HI> and <HI>casual homicide in defence,</HI> the sta∣tute
has truly made the exception of the very species in ques∣tion.
For that by these terms it does not intend a pure acci∣dental
and inculpable slaughter, about which there never could
be any doubt that it was not liable to any penalty, far less to
the pain of death, but homicide upon casual or occasional
rrencounter and sudden provocation, as contradistinguished
to homicide <HI>per industriam,</HI> wilful murder, or of malice afore∣thought,
<PB N="368" REF="427"/>
and without excuse from heat of blood. In sup∣port
of this construction it is urged; that not only in com∣mon
language, but also in the writings of lawyers, both
foreign and municipal<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Nae slaughter done <HI>by chance</HI> or <HI>chaude melle</HI> sould be callit murder, for all murder is committed of fore-thought felony.” Balfour's Practicks, p. 512. “Manslaughter committed voluntarily be fore-thought felony, or <HI>casually by chaude melle,</HI> generally is punished with death,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Skene, of Crimes, tit. 2. c. 6.</NOTE>, and in the texts likewise of the
civil law, the term <HI>casual</HI> has often been used in this loose
and larger sense, to signify any thing that happens sudden∣ly,
and on an unforeseen occasion; and that in this sense
it may properly be, and has been applied to slaughter com∣mitted
in <HI>chaude melle;</HI> where the meeting, the provocation,
and even in some sort the mortal stroke, are all of them
matters of chance and fatality, rather than design. Farther,
and which is more material, it is argued, that in this
sense the term is used in the rubrick of this very statute
“concerning the several degrees of casual homicide,” see∣ing
that pure accidental slaughter admits of no degrees,
but is always one and the same, and exempt from all man∣ner
of pain. Nay more, (proceeds the argument), in this
sense it is even used in the body itself of the statute, and in
that clause relative to “the case of <HI>homicide casual,</HI> and of
homicide in defence,” which empowers the Judge to fine
and imprison the offender; a provision utterly unapplicable
to a pure fortuitous, and in all cases inculpable, act<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Providing always, That in the case of <HI>homicide casual,</HI> and homicide in defence, notwithstanding that the slayer is by this act free from capital punish∣ment, yet it shall be leisum to the criminal Judge, with advice of the Coun∣cil, to fine him in his means, to the use of the defunct's wife and bairns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to imprison him. … And that all cases to be decided by any Judges of this kingdom, in relation to <HI>casual homicide in defence,</HI> committed at any time heretofore, shall be decided as is above expressed.”</NOTE>. As
<PB N="369" REF="428"/>
also it is again used in the same sense in the concluding
period of the statute, where it speaks of <HI>casual homicide
in defence;</HI> a phrase which does not so well apply to any thing
as to this of sudden slaughter, committed in defence against
a farther injury, which there is reason to fear from the
violence already suffered.</P>
<P>IN confirmation of these and other arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaude melle,</HI> if abolished by Act 1661. Aug. 1728. Jan. 1770.</NOTE> which
were urged with the first ability, in the noted cases of Car∣negie
of Finhaven and Mungo Campbell, reference may be
made to a record, not mentioned on either of these oc∣casions,
but which as an evidence of the proper acceptation
of the term <HI>casual</HI> or <HI>accidental</HI> in the Scottish practice, and
also of the nature of that slaughter which is opposed in the law
to slaughter on forethought felony, may seem to have its
weight. What I allude to is the following entry in the cri∣minal
record, relative to a remission of slaughter for Tho∣mas
Crawford.</P>
<P>“WEE his Majestie's Justice-deputes having considered

the said slaughter, and to repoirt our judgment y<SUP>r</SUP> anent:
As also, we having considered the said signator of re∣mission

That the foresaid slaughter committed be the said Hew
Crafurd was without any <HI>precogitate malice or forthought
fellonie;</HI> but that the samyen was committed <HI>ex calore ira∣cundiae,
upon occasion of reproachful speeches</HI> uttered at the
tyme amongst them, <HI>being occasionally together</HI> in ane ordi∣narie
way of friendship and familiarity drinking together,
conform to the narrative of the said remission: because,
<HI>first</HI> we find that the invitation to the alehouse where the
slaughter was committed was from the defunct Wylie,
and not frae Crafurd, who was both unwilling to go to
the house with him; and after the going was glade to be
red of Wylie when he was going away. <HI>Secundly,</HI> Both
Crafurd and the defunct Wylie denyed that there was any
<HI>malice or envy</HI> betwixt them; and it may be seine that the
malice was betwixt Crafurd and Wylie's wyfe for misre∣ports,
or upon the account of any threatening words spo∣ken
by Crafurd before the act. We having examined the
witnesses anent their knowledge of the ground thereof, we
find the samyne so frivolous and little cause, that we can∣not
look upon them as grounds <HI>of ane precogitate malice or in∣tention
to kill,</HI> especially considering that their meeting to∣gether
at that time was <HI>occasionally and accidentally</HI> upon
<PB N="371" REF="430"/>
the invitation and desyre of Wylie, and having gone with
some others their neighbours in a familiar way together;
wheiras we conceive if the samyne had been committed
<HI>upon forthought fellonie or precogitate malice,</HI> Crafurd would not
have desyred so many persons to have gone in with them
to drink to be witnesses thereto. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> After Wylie
was going away and was past the spence door, and almost
at the door of the fyre-house, he turned back again on Cra∣furd,
<HI>and yoked with him</HI> at the spence door, and when the
candle was lighted <HI>they found Wylie was above Crafurd,</HI> and
some of the witnesses depones, <HI>that he had thrust Crafurd to

<DIV2>
<P>NOW, it is remarkable, that in this case, which happened
so recently after the statute 1661, that which is opposed to
slaughter <HI>upon fore-thought felony or out of malice,</HI> is slaughter
upon <HI>accidental meeting or occasional rencounter,</HI> and proceed∣ing
<HI>ex calore iracundiae,</HI> on <HI>provocation and assault</HI> by the per∣son
slain; which circumstances are reported to his Majesty
as reasons for a pardon. The terms too, which are made
use of throughout this paper, are plainly the same in sub∣stance
as that of <HI>casual,</HI> which occurs in the statute 1661.</P>
<P>WHETHER decisive or not of the true meaning of the Le∣gislature,
these remarks are at least sufficient to show,
that the enactment is in some measure doubtful and obscure.
And happily this seems to be all that is requisite, for pre∣serving
this important doctrine to us, as a part of our law.
<PB N="372" REF="431"/>
Being grounded in the highest reason and humanity; being
confirmed by the practice of the most enlightened nations; and
having of old been established in our custom, and acknow∣ledged
by our statutes, in an efficacious and substantial form;
it could not therefore cease to be law, unless in virtue of a
statute which abolished the distinction for the future, in
clear and unambiguous terms. Applied to a matter of this
sort, it is a fair rule of construction, that the failure to ex∣press
and declare, is the same as the want of purpose. And
as long as they have it in their power, our Judges will
properly refuse to believe, that the Legistature entertained
an intention which is plainly barbarous and unjust.</P>
<P>WHETHER long and uniform practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of Act 1661 in Practice.</NOTE> constructive of
the statute in the unfavourable sense, would have been suf∣ficient
to decide this controversy, and to bind our Courts to
so rigorous a rule of judgment, is quite another question,
and one in which there is happily no occasion to engage.
Because in truth, the practice proved to be just that fluctu∣ating
and discordant practice, which is suitable to the ambi∣guity
of the statute, and might naturally be expected to
result from it. Certainly, instances can be produced of libel
found relevant to infer the pains of death, and even of the
pains of death inflicted, in cases where gross provoca∣tion
was proved to have been given. Such among others
is the case of George Cumin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 6. 1695.</NOTE> and more especially that of
Carnegie of Finhaven;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1728.</NOTE> where the defence of a continued
train of provocation by rude behaviour, and injurious words
and gestures, and these followed with an assault on the per∣son
of the pannel, by throwing him violently down into a
deep and offensive puddle, was found insufficient to protect
him from the ordinary pains of law, as for a murder. But
<PB N="373" REF="432"/>
the issue was that the assize, unable to reconcile this opinion
of the Court in point of law to their own feelings of huma∣nity
and justice on the case, found a general verdict of <HI>not
guilty</HI> for the pannel; who was in consequence dismissed
without even a censure of his fault.</P>
<P>ON the other side, it is no less true, that instances, can be
shown, equal at least in number, and more than necessary to keep
the construction of the statute open, of arbitrary punishment
applied to situations, where yet there was no just pretence of
either a pure accidental slaughter, or of danger to the life of
the killer. The defence of previous assault and beating,
was sustained to liberate from the ordinary pains in the case
of Alexander Maxwell and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp; 7. 1690.</NOTE> at the same time that the
defence of actual danger to the life was found relevant
<HI>simpliciter</HI> to assoilzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds that part of the libel raised by Alexander Maxwell, and the other pannels with him, and the defence founded thereon, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was pre∣vious combination, whereupon followed the convocation libelled, to debar and keep out Mr Walter Macgill, the minister, from entering into his church that Sunday, and when they were required to disperse, instead of doing thereof, they took the keys from the bedall, and beat the nottar and the minister's wife, and others, before the slaughter, mutilation, or wounding was commit∣ted, relevant to restrict the slaughter to an arbitrary pain; but find, if the mi∣nister's life was assaulted, or any actual attempt by throwing great stones at him before committing the slaughter libelled, the same is a defence sufficient to liberate from the slaughter and other crimes libelled, <HI>simpliciter.</HI>”</NOTE>. Another very apposite, and indeed
invincible case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. &amp; 16. 1701.</NOTE> is that of Ensign Hardie; in which, after
having repelled certain allegations of real injury, when
pleaded to the effect of self-defence, the Court sustained the
same facts as an aggression, to restrict the libel to an arbi∣trary
<PB N="374" REF="433"/>
pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords sustain these defences proponed for the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> That the defunct was the first aggressor, and did take hold of the pannel's horse bridle, and when he was holding the horse by the bridle, did give the pannel a stroak over the face with a rung or tree, and wounded him to the effusion of his blood, and that the defunct beat the pannel from his horse, <HI>conjunctim</HI> rele∣vant to restrict the libel to an arbitrary punishment; but found the reply made by the pursuers, that the pannel beat the defunct on the face with a thrawn road, before he struck the pannel with the rung or tree, relevant to elide the foresaid defence, <HI>simpliciter.</HI>”</NOTE>. Some years after, even a less violent injury,
by struggling with the pannel to take his carabine from him,
was found relevant to the same effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1710.</NOTE> in the case of Peter
Maclean.</P>
<P>THERE could not in these instances be any doubt of the mor∣tal
purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of Act 1661 in Practice.</NOTE> as the homicide was done with the proper weapons
of slaughter. And after them, though not of the same descrip∣tion
in that particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 19. and Dec. 7. 11. 1733.</NOTE> may properly be subjoined the case of
John Christie; where the manner of the homicide is described
to have been by throwing the deceased to the ground, and dis∣patching
him, while in that situation, with repeated blows of a
big stone, large stick, or other mortal weapon, upon the head
and other parts of the body, whereby his skull was fractu∣red,
and death ensued<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And the said deceased George Crookbone, as became him, endeavouring to restrain your violence upon his said brother, and to prevent any further fight∣ing or quarrelling with you, who having a big stone or large stick, or some other mortal weapon in your hands, and having tript or thrown down upon the ground the said deceased George Crookbone; at least, while the said de∣ceased George Crookbone was lying on the ground, and was in no condition, either to offend you, or to defend himself; you did with the said stone or wea∣pon, most barbarously, inhumanly and feloniously, beat, knock and bruise him upon the head, and sundry other parts of his body, while he was crying out <HI>he was gone,</HI> wherethrough he received a mortal wound or fracture of the bones in his head, and lay upon the streets till he was lifted up, and assisted to walk to the house of—, being all over blood, where he remained speechless, till he died about eight o'clock, or some other hour of the moru∣ing of that day.”</NOTE>. This was an assault of that sort,
<PB N="375" REF="434"/>
from which no inference could arise on the face of the
charge, in favour of the pannel, that he did not intend to
kill. The libel was therefore found relevant to infer the
pains of law, and a proof at large was allowed the pannel
of all matters tending to alleviate or exculpate. The ver∣dict
was thus: “Find it proven, that at the time libelled
the deceased George Crookbone received a stroak on his
head, with a stone from the pannel John Christie, of which
he died; and find it likewise proven, that the pannel was
drunk, and was first attacked by Thomas Crookbone, bro∣ther
to the defunct George Crookbone, in which scuffle
the defunct engaging, received from the pannel the wound
of which he died.” Now what is here found in favour
of the pannel, neither amounts to self-defence, nor is repug∣nant
to the notion of a mortal purpose. Yet his sentence was
only for transportation; which indeed, upon the footing of an
unintentional slaughter, would have been too severe<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>If the Court looked into the proof for explanation of the general terms, used in the interlocutor, they would find still less reason to believe the pannel free of malice. For the fact as proved was, that the deceased, when lying on the ground with his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat off, was repeatedly struck on the head by the pannel, lying above or standing over him, and with a stone clenched in his hand, which he had stooped to take up, when the pannel fell.</P>
<P>In the trial of Thomas Roy at Aberdeen, September 17. 1759, the verdict found, “That the said Thomas Roy did, time and place libelled, with a stone, hit the said John Murray in the head, of which blow the said John Mur∣ray thereafter died; but also found alleviating circumstances proven.” This case was referred for the opinion of all the Judges; but the decision was prevent∣ed by a pardon. See the Record, June 24. 1760.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="435"/>
LAST of all, I shall cite the case of James Christie. The
pannel had stabbed with a sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of Act 1661 in Practice. Oct. 19. and Nov. 12. 15. 1731.</NOTE> but excused the deed
on this ground, that he had found the deceased in the act of
adultery with his wife, and sacrificed him to his resentment
on the spot. This defence, the Court justly found relevant
to restrict the libel to an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“But for restricting the murder libelled to an arbitrary punishment, sustain this defence relevant, that the pannel killed the defunct, while he was in the act of adultery with the pannel's wife, and repel all the other defences.” The jury found the libel not proven.</NOTE>. Yet, how reason∣able
soever this judgment, what other view can be taken of
such a case, than as a case of homicide on high provocation?
And though the provocation be high, yet is it in some re∣spects
not so favourable to the pannel as that of other inju∣ries;
because the homicide is here done on the pure prin∣ciple
of rage and revenge, unaccompanied with that fear of
farther violence, or that personal confusion and alarm, which,
in the ordinary case of assault on the body, concur with the
resentment, and materially strengthen the defence.</P>
<P>WHILE such was the fluctuating and discordant state of
practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi∣cide on Provo∣cation now Part of the Law.</NOTE> in the construction of the statute 1661, no conclu∣sive
argument could well be reared upon that law, being
conceived in so equivocal terms, to exclude those strong con∣siderations
of reason, humanity, and the example of other na∣tions,
which all unite towards the allowance of this impor∣tant
distinction. Of late years, the opinion of the Court
has been more favourable to the reception of it; and the
term <HI>culpable homicide,</HI> as signifying slaughter on great provo∣cation,
and punishable at the discretion of the Judge, seems
to be fast gaining an establishment as a proper phrase of
style, in libels, interlocutors, and verdicts.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="436"/>
I REFER the reader to the following cases, in evidence of
this improvement of our practice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cases of Homi∣cide on Provo∣cation. Feb. 4. 1788.</NOTE> First the case of Richard
Firmin and Allan Macfarlane, who were charged with the
murder of Kennedy, by shooting him with a musquet. At
calling, the Lord Advocate restricted his libel to a charge
of culpable homicide; and in these terms, though bearing
a narrative which left no doubt of the mortal purpose, it
was sustained by the Court to infer an arbitrary punishment.
There was formerly occasion to mention, that the pannels,
having acted in their duty, had a general verdict in their
favour.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The case of George White, August, 4. 1788.
The charge against him was alternative, as for murder or
culpable homicide; and the narrative of the libel was, that
he had killed the deceased by first striking him on the head
with a candlestick, which beat him to the ground, and af∣terwards
on the same part with a bottle, which cut and
wounded him; so that he died of the consequences. The
charge of murder was found relevant to infer the pains of
law, and the other charge to infer an arbitrary punishment.
He was convicted of culpable homicide only; and had sen∣tence
to pay a fine of 100 merks, and to be imprisoned for
eight months.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, The case of James M'Ghie, Jan. 17. 1791; who
killed the deceased by striking him on the head, with a pair
of heavy iron tongs, while lying on the ground. In this case
also the charge was alternative; and the pannel pleaded
in defence, the provocation and alarm of a violent assault
made by the deceased on his father in his presence, by
throwing him to the ground, and severely beating him
when in that situation. The libel was found relevant, ge∣nerally,
to infer the pains of law. He was convicted of
<PB N="378" REF="437"/>
culpable homicide, and had sentence of banishment from
Scotland for seven years.</P>
<P>IN the circuit-courts also, of late years, many charges
and convictions of culpable homicide have been the grounds
of sentence; though in cases where the manner of the as∣sault
did not give any reason to presume, that the pannel
was not actuated by a mortal or highly outrageous purpose.</P>
<P>BUT though the distinction of murder and homicide on
provocation has thus at length become a part of our law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisite De∣gree of Provo∣cation.</NOTE> as
of that of England; it is not however to be imagined, that it is
therefore established in the precise same terms in both, or that
our practice has adopted the opinions of the English lawyers
with respect to the kind or degree of provocation, which
will save from the ordinary pains. On the contrary, there
is in this article a great and substantial difference between
our system and theirs. Thus far the two coincide, that no
provocation of words, the most foul and abusive, nor of signs
and gestures, how contemptuous or derisive soever, is of
sufficient weight in the scale, materially to alleviate the
guilt; so that if John, upon words or signs of reproach by
James, straightway take up a knife and stab him, or a heavy
hammer and beat out his brains, he shall be judged a
murderer, and die. In this also their doctrine agrees, that
they make no account of provocation by trespass on lands
or goods, if not accompanied with violence to the person;
whereby, if John find James breaking down his fence, or en∣tering
his inclosure to search for game without his leave, or
pasturing cattle on his grounds, or poinding John's cattle
when they are upon John's own property; in none of these
cases is it any thing less than murder, if John shall be so far
transported with rage at this trivial and reparable offence,
<PB N="379" REF="438"/>
as to knock the trespasser on the head. In this all the
English authorities are agreed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 290. 291.; Hale, vol. 1. p. 455. 456.; Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 27. No. 33.; Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 200.</NOTE>; and certainly for reasons
so obvious and convincing as admit of no reply.</P>
<P>BUT it is farther the sentiment of several,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisite De∣gree of Provo∣cation.</NOTE> and among the
ablest of their writers on law, that <HI>any</HI> assault on the person
of the killer sufficiently extenuates his guilt, to lower the case
to manslaughter; though the injury be nothing more than a
single blow with the hand, or twisting the nose, or a fillip on
the forehead, or justling in the street, or whipping the per∣son's
horse out of the track<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 455. 456.; Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 36.; Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>. Farther; it is the concur∣ring
doctrine of all their books, that where on a sudden
quarrel, parties fight upon the spot with mortal weapons,
and on equal terms, (each giving the other time to draw
and be on his guard); or even if in heat of blood they fetch
their weapons, and go to the field and fight; there also the
deed comes under the notion of manslaughter only<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 295. No. 3. p. 297. No. 5.; Hawkins, vol. i. c. 31. No. 28. 29. and 34.; Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>: and
this without any regard to the first provocation, whether it
be verbal or real, or from which of the parties it come.</P>
<P>NOW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisite De∣gree of Prove∣cation.</NOTE> in all these articles, our practice is formed upon
quite another plan. To have a good plea of extenuation,
the pannel, at the time of killing, must have stood in the
situation of an assaulted and injured person; one who was in
a manner constrained to strike by the violence which he
<PB N="380" REF="439"/>
was suffering from the deceased. If in any degree the mor∣tal
strife was matter of convention between the parties,
though but tacitly, and taken up at the moment; if the mor∣tal
blow was pot the impulse of instant pain and agitation,
but of a purpose to fight as on a certain plan and set of prin∣ciples;
this, according to our notions, is murder in the sur∣viver.
In which point of view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Fair Combat in Heat of Blood.</NOTE> the circumstance of waiting,
till the other party draw and be on his guard; that favour∣able
circumstance which makes it manslaughter by the law of
England; would not with us be of any advantage to the pan∣nel,
as shewing plain deliberation, presence of mind, and me∣thod
in his revenge. This, our rule, is proved by the two cases
formerly related,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 17. 1670.</NOTE> of James Murray and James Gray, both of
them cases of fair combat in heat of blood and on a re∣cent
quarrel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 1678.</NOTE> To which may be added (though with respect
to the sufficiency of the evidence, the verdict has been
thought questionable),<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 4. 1667.</NOTE> the case of William Douglas, for the
slaughter of Home of Eccles, which was shortly thus: That
these persons along with others, had quarrelled when at
dinner in a tavern, and having taken coach instantly drove
to the adjacent fields, where they set to consusedly with
swords, two against two; and Home was killed, as was al∣leged
(and indeed I think is proved), by Douglas. The same
principle seems to have ruled in the case of Andrew Ru∣therford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. &amp; 16. 1674.</NOTE>
indicted for the murder of James Douglas. This
slaughter had taken place on a sudden quarrel, of which
it could not be said on the proof who was the author, or
who had been the first to draw: only the parties were seen by
persons at some distance to alight from their horses and
thrust at each other, neither of them, as far as appeared, ta∣king
undue advantage, or giving back or declining the com∣bat.
The jury found the slaughter proved, and the self∣defence
<PB N="381" REF="440"/>
not proved. And the Court, who by their interlo∣cutor
had previously required it of the pannel to bring proof
of self-defence, gave sentence of death.</P>
<P>WITH us too, though not always a decisive, it is general∣ly
an unfavourable circumstance for the pannel in this que∣stion,
that he has struck the first blow. If John strike James
a blow with the hand, and James return it with severe blows
of a staff, on which John, being hurt and irritated, draws,
but gives James time to do the like, and thus they fight and
James is killed, this is murder by the Scottish practice;
however such a case might be resolved in the courts of Eng∣land.
We cannot make the same allowance for his being
provoked, who is only in a situation to be so by his own in∣temperate
and unlawful act, and has shewn an absolute dis∣regard
of those very emotions in his neighbour, which he
would have excused in his own case. His assault of his
neighbour's person justified the return of blows; and, though
there be excess, he cannot therefore be either justifiable or
excusable to resent these, (while they do not put his life in
danger), unto the death of his neighbour. This rule is
pointedly announced in the interlocutor on the case of
Ensign Hardie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1701.</NOTE> where it is sustained to restrict the libel to
an arbitrary pain, that the deceased was the first aggressor,
and had laid hold of the horse's bridle, and struck Hardie
on the face with a rung or tree: but this passage immediate∣ly
follows; “But sind the <HI>reply</HI> made by the pursuers, that
the pannel beat the defunct on the face with a thrawn
rod before he struck the pannel with the rung or tree, re∣levant
to elide the foresaid defence <HI>simpliciter.</HI>”</P>
<P>THE difference is still more remarkable with regard to the
degree of injury and provocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisite De∣gree of Provo∣cation.</NOTE> which will be received
<PB N="382" REF="441"/>
in our Courts to extenuate the guilt. That any even gross in∣dignity
is sufficient, or any assault on the person of so slight a
nature as those which are mentioned in the English books
of law; this it would be contrary to the whole tenor of our
records to believe. Suffice it to mention upon this head,
(since the invariable course of judgment makes it needless to
accumulate authorities),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8. &amp; 9. 1693.</NOTE> the case of William Aird, for the
murder of Agnes Bayne, by throwing her backwards down
stairs. The allegation was here repelled, of her having pro∣voked
him by tossing the contents of a chamber-pot in his
face<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of Joseph Hume, February 26. 1732, a defence of jostling and verbal abuse was once made, but almost immediately abandoned.</NOTE>. In short, it is to be understood, that it does not
come up to the due description of the defence by our
law, that the pannel is in rage and heat of blood, though
owing to some improper freedom which the deceased has
taken with his person: This passion must be occasioned by
some adequate and serious cause, some severe and continued
assault, such as carries agitation and alarm with it, a dread of
farther harm and injury, as well as present smart and pain
of body; whereby the sufferer is <HI>excusable</HI> in the loss of his
presence of mind, and excess of the just measure of reta∣liation.
Excepting the peculiar case of slaughter com∣mitted
on the adulterer discovered in the fact, I am ac∣quainted
with no case of culpable homicide in our record,
which is not more or less of this description; not a case of
passion only, but of passion excited by bodily suffering, and
mingled with terror, and with perturbation of spirits. And
truly it may be doubted, whether in this our rule is not
wiser and more salutary, at least more suitable to the fer∣vent
temper of the Scottish people, than that of the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="383" REF="442"/>
kingdom, which excuses the mortal revenge of such
inconsiderable wrongs. To curb and repress an over-jea∣lous,
choleric, or quarrelsome humour, as far as can be
done without injustice in the particular case, and thus to
bend the temper to the course of civil order, is the main
scope of law in this whole department of offences against the
person. And this object seems to be duly kept in view in our
practice, when it has consideration of human infirmity in
those difficult and agitating situations only, which require
a more than ordinary strength of mind, and command of
temper to withstand them; not in those, where the pride
more than the body of the man has been offended.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, upon which it would not become
the lawyers of either country to express themselves with
confidence, clear it is, that such is our fixed and certain
rule.</P>
<P>AND here I shall take occasion to observe touching the noted
case of Mungo Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Mungo Campbell.</NOTE> though certainly a case of difficul∣ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1769.</NOTE>
and well deserving of that deliberate attention which it
received,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1770.</NOTE> that it was judged in strict conformity to the
whole series of precedents, either of an ancient or a modern
date, that are to be found upon record. On the whole
circumstances of the situation, even those of the Judges who
were most favourable to the pannel, and along with them
the jury had been of opinion, that the injury to his person
was not of that degree, nor had been prosecuted to that
length<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Notes of the opinions of the Judges in this case, in Maclaurin's Criminals.</NOTE>, which could excuse his passion, or extenuate the
guilt; so that the deed was rather to be held a wilful and
<PB N="384" REF="443"/>
resentful deed, the fruit of the habit of mind, the proud and
jealous temper of the man, who acted deliberately on the
occasion, than of excusable perturbation and terror, or im∣mediate
distress of body. If, in prosecution of his unlaw∣ful
purpose, Lord Eglinton had advanced on Campbell,
and had laid hold of the piece; and thus a personal struggle
had ensued, in which Campbell, defending his property,
(and certainly he was not obliged to quit it), had been
beaten and overpowered, or injured in his body, before dis∣charging
his piece; this would have been a far more favour∣able
case, and indeed, in my mind, hardly distinguishable
from that already mentioned, of Maclean, in 1710, where
an assault on a person, to take his carabine from him, was
found relevant to restrict the libel to an arbitrary pain. For
this would not have been a situation of simple trespass on
goods, but of trespass necessarily coupled to assault of the
person. But taking all the particulars of this unfortunate
story; it could scarcely be said that Campbell had been at
all assaulted, or had any reasonable or well grounded ap∣prehension
of future harm to his person. Certainly, at the
time of discharging his piece, any provocation he had yet
received was not higher than if he had been justled in pas∣sing,
or pulled by the nose, or kicked on the breech; no
one of which indignities, according to any authority or pre∣cedent
that can be produced in the law of Scotland, would
have been sufficient to excuse him. In fine, he had shown
nothing of that forbearance, that phlegm and tardiness of
blood, which, according to the course of our practice, is a
necessary accompanyment of this plea, but rather a cho∣leric
and jealous disposition hastily to lay hold of the first
opportunity of offence, for the purpose of revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="444"/>
FROM what has now been said, with regard to the degree
of injury which will extenuate the guilt of slaughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation by Execution of ir∣regular War∣rants.</NOTE> there
results an important, but it should seem an unavoidable con∣sequence,
touching the construction of that slaughter, which
is committed in resistance of defective and irregular warrants,
or warrants executed in an irregular way. A messenger by
mistake arrests John, instead of James; or on a warrant
against John, he arrests that person, who knows him not,
without saying who or what he is; or he arrests John on
a warrant which bears an erroneous description of him, or
is otherwise not in due form of law. In some of these
cases the prisoner suffers a degree of provocation at the
time; and it may be said, that in all of them there is a
wrong or trespass on the part of the officer, who ought to see
that his warrant is good, and should proceed lawfully in the
execution of it. But to hold, which seems to be the rule in
the neighbouring kingdom, that it is such a wrong as will ex∣cuse
the party thus molested, if on mention of the mistake, and
in some instances even without that warning, he straightway
kill the officer with a mortal weapon, and though no personal
harm have yet ensued<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Foster, p. 312. No. 9.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 83. No. 36. p. 87. No. 56. 57. 58.; Hale, vol. i. p. 457. 458. 470.</P>
<P>See also the case of Mary Adey, (Leach's Cases, No. 99.) who stabbed a con∣stable's assistant, in defence of a man with whom she cohabited, and whom the constable meant to apprehend under a statute, as an idle and disorderly person. The constable had not even touched his person, but had entered his room without violence, and told the man that he must come along with him; which the assist∣ant repeated. On this the woman instantly stabbed the assistant in the side. The jury found these facts, and that the man was not an object of the statute. The case was referred for the opinion of the twelve Judges; which was never public∣ly given. But the woman, after lying 18 months in gaol, was discharged.</P></NOTE>; this is far from being in the dis∣position
or analogy of the law of Scotland. Very suitable
it may be to the rest of the English practice, which holds
<PB N="386" REF="445"/>
that a pull by the nose, or a fillip on the forehead, (injuries
not more material than a rude invasion of a person's liber∣ty),
is a provocation to extenuate the guilt. But as suitable
as such a rule is to their practice, as unsuitable it would be
to ours, which is quite a stranger to any plea of extenua∣tion
grounded on such trivial offences, and requires a proof
of bodily distress and agitation of spirits in the case of as∣sault
by any ordinary man, and much more will require it
in the case of an officer of the law; who may indeed be in
the wrong, or fall into an error, but has commonly some co∣lour
of excuse, and opinion of duty, more or less, for what
he doth. Though he do err, still he is not divested of his
character of servant of the law, which is itself entitled to
regard; as well as in all cases where he is known to be act∣ing
in that capacity, the motive, scope, and extent of his
purpose, are at the same time evident to the party; so that
by compliance, which is here a safe measure, all fear of
farther violence shall at once be at end: Not to mention the
more certain means of redress of the wrong, and punish∣ment
of the offender, which the person aggrieved enjoys in
all cases of this description. If therefore, instead of submit∣ting
for the time, as any man of a well regulated mind would
be disposed to, he shall take advantage of the mistake,
straightway to stab or shoot the officer, before any great
struggle has ensued, or any grievous harm of body been
sustained by him; certainly, in consistency with the rest of
our law, he cannot be found guilty of any lower crime than
murder.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="446"/>
PUT the case, that a Sheriff's officer having warrant
against a criminal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation by Execution of a vitious War∣rant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> has ignorantly followed him beyond the
bounds of the sheriffdom; and having overtaken, has laid
hold of him by the collar of the coat, to keep him, but with∣out
striking, or offering other violence to his person. If
in this situation the prisoner draw a knife and stab the offi∣cer,
he can neither be justified nor excused. Because even
between man and man, and supposing the one party not to
be an officer of the law, nor the other a felon, this purpose
of detention, and executed in so moderate a way, is not a
wrong of that degree, which would at all extenuate the
guilt of slaughter. And surely if it is not more, the case is
at least not less favourable to the officer, on account of these
circumstances in the relative situation of the parties. If a
struggle and beating ensue on the attempt, it will depend on
the degree of violence, as in other cases, whether this will
bring down the charge to culpable homicide. Or if the offi∣cer,
being resisted, strike the felon so as to put him in danger
of his life; still, to be completely <HI>justified,</HI> the felon must ob∣serve
the <HI>moderamen inculpatae tutelae</HI> in his defence: for so he
must have done on occasion even of a causeless and mali∣cious
quarrel, fastened on him by any one of the people, with∣out
pretence of warrant, or opinion of duty, to support him.
On the whole, there seems to be the highest equity and
reason in considering the hard situation of an officer of the
law, to whom the defect of his warrant may often be utter∣ly
impossible to be known, and who as often cannot judge
of the defect, and is obliged by his duty to proceed in the
execution of it; and yet according to the supposed doctrine
of the law of England, may be killed with impunity by a
ruffian, equally ignorant of that defect as the officer, and
<PB N="388" REF="447"/>
who is only actuated at the time by malignity and brutal
rage.</P>
<P>THE chief illustration of this doctrine is the late case
of John and Arthur O'Neal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5. and Feb. 4. 2. &amp; 4. 1796.</NOTE> These pannels were father and
son; and a warrant had been issued against them, as idle and
disorderly persons, to apprehend, and bring them for exa∣mination,
in order to their being adjudged as soldiers, under
a statute which gave powers to that effect. The men were
known to be resolute, and to have a purpose of resisting the
warrant, which had come to their knowledge; and a party of
soldiers was therefore sent with the constable, to support him
in his office. On their arrival at the house, and after notifi∣cation
of their business to those within, but before any at∣tempt
to break open the door, three shot were immediately
fired at the party, (indeed it was proved that they had pro∣vided
shot and loaded their guns, on purpose to resist);
and shortly after three shot more were fired; whereby one
man was killed, and several were wounded. In charging the
jury (for it was not pleaded to the Court on the relevancy),
the pannels counsel took two exceptions to the warrant,
as not within the terms of the statute; 1<HI>st,</HI> That it was
not under the seal as well as the hand of the magistrates,
(which no Scots warrant is); and, 2<HI>dly,</HI> That the warrant
bore a blank day of examination, instead of the next law∣ful
day of meeting, according to the direction of the act.
But the Lord Justice-Clerk, to whom it fell to address the
jury before inclosing, and who alone of all the Judges had
an opportunity of speaking on this objection, was very
explicit in his opinion, that these circumstances, which
were utterly unknown at the time of the slaughter, were no
extenuation of the guilt. The jury found the father guilty,
and he had sentence of death. He afterwards received a
<PB N="389" REF="448"/>
pardon; but on what grounds has not been communicated to
the public.</P>
<P>AFTER these circumstances of difference in the practice
of the two countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Excuse if the killing be deliberate.</NOTE> I shall now take notice of one article
of doctrine in which they are agreed. This is in excluding
the defence, in any case where, on the whole circumstances of
his behaviour, the pannel shall appear to have acted delibe∣rately,
and to have been master of his emotions. If the
husband find the adulterer in the act, and kill him on the
spot, he is excusable for this transport of sudden rage on such
an injury: but if he confine him till next day, and then kill
him, or if he force him to swallow a dose of poison, or if he
castrate him, and the person die of the operation; in all
these cases he has lost the privilege which is allowed to hu∣man
infirmity. In like manner, a schoolmaster; if instead
of instant correction in the usual way, he shall send for
some extraordinary instrument of torture, or shall bind his
pupil neck and heel, and scourge him in that posture, or
shall lock him up for an hour, and then scourge him so
that he dies; he cannot pretend to have been actuated by
the due motives as a preceptor, and shall answer it like any
other man. For all these are acts of deliberate and inven∣tive
cruelty, on a principle of revenge; which is always
murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 296. 7.; Hale, vol. i. p. 453—4.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 81. No. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the close of all, I shall venture to observe, that as
with regard to the degree of provocation which makes
a case of culpable homicide, so also with regard to the
judgment which may competently pass on the offender, it
may deserve to be considered, whether our law is not upon
as salutary a footing as that of England. For our Judges
<PB N="390" REF="449"/>
have a discretion in this matter, to condemn the manslayer
to such a punishment, according to the measure of his fault,
which shall truly serve as a correction to him, and a warn∣ing
to others. Whereas, in England, the judgment is one
invariable thing, the forfeiture of moveables, and burning
in the hand; which is very unequal in its application to the
different conditions of life, and if carried into effect, may
be either too severe or too lenient a course; but as some∣times
managed, by gift of the forfeiture to the offender him∣self,
becomes no punishment at all. But I find that I am
now venturing out of my proper sphere.</P>
<P>VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder; what its characteris∣tic.</NOTE> To proceed, therefore, with our subject. I shall now
examine the third degree of homicide, the crime of WILFUL
MURDER, for which the laws of all civilized nations, here∣in
conform to the Divine law, admit of no atonement, but
with the offender's life.</P>
<P>THE characteristic of this sort of homicide is, that it is
done wilfully, and out of malice afore-thought. But these
terms are not here to be received in their restricted and most
obvious sense, of a rooted and special enmity to the decea∣sed,
but only in the larger and more general sense of <HI>dole,</HI>
or a wicked and mischievous purpose, and as contradistin∣guished
to those motives of necessity, duty, or allowable in∣firmity,
which may serve to justify or to excuse the deed.</P>
<P>How far this construction will hold against the pan∣nel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Malice be special, or prior to Meet∣ing.</NOTE>
in the case of a mortal purpose not particularly directed
against the individual who has perished, was illustrated for∣merly,
in the general title of Crimes, and shall not now be
resumed. But farther, where the malice is special; as
little does it lie with the prosecutor, to assign or prov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any
<PB N="391" REF="450"/>
probable cause to which it may be ascribed, or to shew
that it has been of long endurance, or even prior to the fa∣tal
meeting of the parties. The more strange and unac∣countable
such malignity, the deeper is the guilt of the deed;
and how recent soever the occasion of it, if it precede and
be the motive of the mortal blow, “<HI>si antecedit ictum licet
non congressum,</HI>” the crime is murder, and the pannel's life
shall be forfeited for that which he has thus unnecessarily,
and without provocation, destroyed. The malice is im∣plied
in the act itself of intentional killing, which is the
highest possible injury, and naturally carries with it the pre∣sumption
of <HI>malus animus;</HI> which it therefore lies on the
pannel to overcome by proof made on his part, of some of
those circumstances of necessity, or excusable infirmity, in
which he may have a defence. “<HI>Non enim</HI> (says Mathaeus<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In Tit. de Sicariis, Chap. 3. No. 14.</P>
<P>In the trial of Andrew Rutherford, November 9. 10. 12. 1674, “The Lords find the lybell relevant, as likewise the pannell's defence of self-defence, <HI>and that the pannell ought to prove the sumin,</HI> and remitts both to the know∣ledge of an assize.” The jury found the slaughter proved, and the self-defence not. The pannel had sentence of death. He had pled that self-defence should be presumed, unless it were proved, that he was the aggressor. The parties here were seen thrusting at each other by persons at a distance; and who was the provoker, or who drew first, did not appear from the proof.</P></NOTE>.)
<HI>eam defensionem proposuisse satis est, nisi cadem idoneis argumen∣tis
probetur. In dubio enim caedes sicut quaevis injuria presumi∣tur
dolo malo facta.</HI>” The commentator has justly said, <HI>sicut
quaevis injuria;</HI> for we are not here taking up any strained
or peculiar rule, out of aversion only to blood, and in order
the better to repress so high a crime, but just the plain and
ordinary rule, which equally applies to any other violence
that is committed on the person.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="451"/>
IN particular, this was very expressly declared to be law
in the case of James Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sufficient, if Mulice taken up on the Spot. June 10. &amp; 11. 1678.</NOTE> where the libel bore a narrative
of deadly hatred; in respect of which it was pleaded that
the prosecutor, <HI>in this case,</HI> must prove that quality of his
charge. The Court found, that no such proof could be re∣quired
of him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel relevant, and that there is no necessity of any distinct probation for proving of precogitate malice, and remits the libel to an assize.”</NOTE>. The like defence was over-ruled in the
case of William Aird, September 8. 1693<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find the indictment relevant, and remits the same to the knowledge of an assize, and repels the defences and duplies made for the pannels.”</NOTE>; of George Cu∣ming,
November 11. 20. 1695<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">“Finds the indictment as it is libelled, relevant to infer the pains libelled, and repels the defence as reformed, and the haill other defences proponed for the pannel.”</NOTE>; and of Lindsay and Brock,
July 29. and November 15. 1717; as in many other cases of
a prior date, which it were tedious to recite. On the same
ground relevancy was sustained in these later cases; that of
David Pretis, January 19. 26. and February 2. 1730; Ro∣bert
Brown, January 19. 26. 1730; Matthew Randal, July
6. 7. 1730; George Donald, August 4. 11. 1730; in the
two first of which, the libel was entirely silent as to the
cause of hatred, or occasion of quarrel, and in the other two
only made mention of some very trivial interference at the
moment of the slaughter. These four pannels were all con∣victed
and executed.</P>
<P>As there is thus no need of any proof on the prosecu∣tor's
part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Libel bear Malice.</NOTE> but of the bare act of violently killing, accom∣panied
<PB N="393" REF="452"/>
with a purpose so to do, so neither is it indispen∣sable
to the charge, that it proceed on the narrative of
deadly malice and hatred conceived to the deceased. If it
bear the crime of murder in the <HI>major</HI> proposition, and say
in the <HI>minor</HI> that the pannel, at such a time and place, did
murder, or did cruelly kill and slay the deceased, by such
and such acts of great violence, these terms are themselves
an implied charge of the sort of malice which the law re∣quires;
how strange and unaccountable soever it may seem
in the circumstances of the case, that the pannel should
have been actuated by any such evil passion. A charge of
this sort was sustained against Alexander Robertson, Janu∣ary
1. 1679; against Richard Carse, June 10. and 17. 1700;
and on full debate, in the case of William Ross, February
9. and 16. 1719<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“In so far as, upon the, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he did kill and murder John Allardyce, peri∣wig-maker in Edinburgh, in his own house in Blackfriars Wynd in Edin∣burgh, or in the stair leading to it, by giving him a wound with a sword in the body.”</NOTE>. It was again sustained in the case of Hen∣ry
Hawkins<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“That whereas by the law of this and every well governed realm, murder, or the bereaving an innocent man of his life, is a great crime, and severely pu∣nishable;” and then it proceeds to relate, that a squabble having arisen at the guard-house between him and the deceased, “he did with a screwed bayonet seloniously stab the deceased.”</NOTE>, July 17. 1769; of James Baillie, December
16. 1771; and of Brown and Wilson, June 28. 1773; and of
George White, August 4. 1788; and in some of these instances
after debate on the objection. In addition to this list, which
might be swelled to a great bulk, notice may also be taken
of an entire class of cases, in which I do not observe
that any charge of malice has ever been made; I mean
cases of child-murder. The reason is, that the infant or∣dinarily
<PB N="394" REF="453"/>
is destroyed at the very moment of the birth, and
before, in any proper sense, it can be the object of the mo∣ther's
hatred. It may farther be remarked, that while the
fashion of special interlocutors of relevancy continued, this of
hatred born the deceased, though often stated in the libel, is
one of those articles which the interlocutor never repeated,
nor required to be proved. Thus, on the whole, the malice
which the law requires in this particular, turns out to be no
more than this,—a depraved and wicked disposition; a heart
regardless of duty or humanity; which is to be gathered
from the whole circumstances of the case, as they are shown
in evidence.</P>
<P>THIS will more plainly appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden∣di,</HI> how far es∣sential.</NOTE> if it be considered, that
even the <HI>animus occidendi,</HI> the purpose to deprive the deceased
of life, is not essential to the charge of murder; that is to
say, in the most obvious sense of the phrase, and that in which
it is ordinarily understood. If indeed the pannel bring a
proof of such circumstances in exculpation, or can point out
such in the manner of the assault which is related in the libel,
as are repugnant to the very notion of a mortal purpose, and
show that the slaughter fell out in an improbable and unex∣pected
manner, and in the prosecution of some inferior and not
outrageous object; certainly this will have its due effect of
restricting the charge to an arbitrary pain. This matter
was formerly illustrated, in the case of death taking place
on a single blow with the hand, or on a fall, occasioned by
a push or jostling. Of the same character also are such cases
as these: If the pannel, having a drawn sword in his hand,
throw it away and betake himself to a staff; or if having a
loaded pistol, he fire it off in the air and strike with the but;
unless these favourable circumstances, which yield probable e∣vidence
<PB N="395" REF="454"/>
of a purpose to chastise only, shall be outweighed by
after excess in the use of those instruments, or by other in∣cidents
in the progress of the contest.</P>
<P>BUT, with the exception of cases of this description,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden∣di,</HI> how far es∣sential.</NOTE> our
practice, which in this is the same as that of England<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 454. 472.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 74. No. 10. p. 83. No. 38.; Foster, p. 291. No. 2.; Plackstone, vol. iv. p. 199.</NOTE>, does
not distinguish between an absolute purpose to kill, and the
purpose to do any excessive and grievous injury to the person.
So that if the pannel assaulted the deceased meaning to ham∣string
him, or to cut out his tongue, or to break his bones, or
to beat him severely, (or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to beat
him within an inch of his life), and in the prosecution of this
outrageous purpose has actually destroyed his victim, he shall
equally die for it, as if he had run him through the body
with a sword. And the reasons are obvious and satisfac∣tory,
why no other judgment can pass on such a case. Be∣cause
to observe any other rule, would be to secure an in∣demnity
to all but those, comparatively rare, cases of mur∣der,
which are done with the peculiar instruments of slaugh∣ter.
Because, in committing any such flagrant outrage on
the body, the pannel shews an utter contempt of the safety,
distress, and existence of his neighbour, and if not a deter∣mination
to kill him, at least an absolute indifference about
the consequence to him, whether he live or die. And be∣cause,
from the very excess of the injury, the case does not
admit any clear or conclusive proof on the part of the pan∣nel,
that at the moment of killing he did not mean the thing
to follow, which actually happened. In great injuries and
violences there is no wounding by rule, so as with cer∣tainty
<PB N="396" REF="455"/>
not to kill. Neither is there in nature any precise
measure of the rage and mischievous feeling at such mo∣ments
of furious action, by which even the actor himself
can certainly tell, and much less can others discover, whe∣ther
he meant to kill, or barely to leave life in the ob∣ject
of his revenge. If he answer truly with respect to his
state of conscience on such an occasion, all that he can say
will be, that he was transported with rage and hatred, and
cared not what became of it, so he had his vengeance out.
He must therefore be accountable for it as a murder; since
knowing these things, he nevertheless resolved, that rather
than forego his vengeance, or employ some inferior means,
his neighbour should run this hazard of his life; so low was
his regard of his neighbour's safety. Now this <HI>corrupt dis∣regard</HI>
of the person and existence of another, is precisely
the dole or malice, the depraved and wicked purpose, which
the law requires and is content with<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Dolosum homicidium est, quod vel animo et proposito occidendi, vol so∣lum vulnerandi voluntate committitur.” Carps. Quaest. 27. n. 5.</NOTE>. It looks with a
jealous eye upon every act that has destroyed a man; and
wheresoever any one has been killed by the hand of his
neighbour lifted in outrageous or continued violence against
him, will presume that if not at first invaded, he was at least
continued to be abused, out of growing rage and malignity,
and with a purpose of doing that which in the end was done.
In short, to have the benefit of the plea of culpable homicide,
he must either point out such circumstances upon the face of
the charge in the libel, or in the evidence brought in support
of it, or he must bring such a proof on his own part, as
shews that the mischief which he meant was of that infe∣rior
kind, from which, according to the common course of
<PB N="397" REF="456"/>
things, not even any material danger of the person's life
was to be dreaded.</P>
<P>AMONG the many cases which might be appealed to in
evidence of this just and necessary rule of practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden∣di,</HI> how far es∣sential.</NOTE> that
which perhaps to most advantage illustrates it, is the case of
Dougal Macfarlane, tried in November 1737. This man
had quarrelled with John Woore, officer of excise at Crief,
on occasion of something relative to his duty in the gauging
of malt liquors, which belonged to the pannel's master.
And having learned that he was to pass by a certain way
under cloud of night, he solicited several persons, and prevail∣ed
with three of them, to go along with him, and lie in wait
by the side of the way, (as he expressed it), <HI>“to cuff the gauger.”</HI>
They went out accordingly, all of them provided with sticks
only, though other weapons might easily have been procu∣red.
And having met with Woore, they pulled him to the
ground from his horse, and there severely beat the poor man,
on the head and sundry parts of the body, so that he remain∣ed
upon the road insensible, and was next morning found
dead. It appears that Macfarlane in particular, reproached
one of the party for failing to use his stick, and having pul∣led
it out of his hand, returned and beat Woore a second time,
as he lay. The whole party, however, returned to the village
where they resided, and had liquor there from Macfarlane's
master and mistress, to whom he openly boasted of what he
had done, saying, <HI>“that he had cured the gauger of his gauging
for a week.”</HI> He slept too that night at home, and made
no attempt to escape. These and other circumstances of
the story were made use of to show, that the death of the
man was not within the compass of their project; whence
<PB N="398" REF="457"/>
it was argued, that only an arbitrary punishment could be in∣flicted.
But the answer was thought good, that the pannel had
deliberately planned an excessive and outrageous injury to the
person of the deceased; and as in the execution it had been pro∣secuted
to the death of his victim, so in the nature of things
it could not plainly appear, that at the moment of killing he
did not truly mean to destroy: In the most favourable view,
he was at least resolved on that which was to put the man
in imminent danger of his life; and he must stand there∣fore
to the issue of the hazard, which he had thus wicked∣ly
brought on his neighbour. The defences were repelled,
and the beating, even without the way-laying, was found re∣levant
to infer the highest pains. The fact was fully pro∣ved;
and the pannel had sentence of death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 28. 1737. “Find that Dougal Macfarlane pannel having time and place libelled way-laid the deceased J. Woore, officer of excise, and meeting with him, did, with a rung or large stick, beat him, whereby the said J. W. did soon thereafter die; <HI>or</HI> that he the said pannell did time and place foresaid, with repeated strokes of a rung or large stick, beat the said deceased J. W. to that degree that he did soon thereafter die thereof; <HI>or</HI> that time and place foresaid the said J. W. was killed in manner libelled, and that the pannell was art and part thereof, all <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer the pains of law; and repell the haill defences.” It will be observed, that in the second member of this interlocutor, the beating is found relevant without the way-laying.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER case of the same stamp,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden∣di,</HI> how far es∣sential.</NOTE> and which was decided
on the same principle, is that of David Hume, tried in Octo∣ber
1723. This man, along with two more, of the name
of Sinclair, had conceived a grudge against John Horsely
and others, Englishmen, and servants of the York-buildings
Company on their estate of Winton, who had reproved them
<PB N="399" REF="458"/>
for passing through the inclosures without leave. They
were heard, without much reserve, to threaten mischief to
<HI>the Englishmen,</HI> and to say, that they should be for ever <HI>af∣fronted,</HI>
if they had not amends of them. One evening, in
the dusk, they accordingly lay in wait, by a wall near the
house of Seaton, and set upon and beat one of Horsely's
servants, who had come out to draw water; and on his gi∣ving
the alarm, and another coming out, they set upon and
beat him also, with rungs and staves, in such a manner that
he died. There was nothing in these circumstances to in∣dicate
a formed purpose of assassination: But the Court not∣withstanding,
as in the other case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 9. &amp; 16. 1723.</NOTE> found, “That David
Home pannel having at the time and place libelled, beat or
wounded George Sweet servant to John Horsely possessor
of Seaton, of which strokes or wounds the said George
Sweet did soon thereafter die, relevant to infer the pain of
death, and consiscation of moveables.” The pannel, how∣ever,
was not convicted.</P>
<P>I SHALL only take notice of one case more, an old case,
and one of much malignity and cruelty, but in which the
pannel cannot be said to have had an absolute purpose to
destroy. I allude to the case of Patrick Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1602.</NOTE> who having
conceived great malice at Angus Maciver, on suspicion of
unlawful intercourse with his daughter, took possession of his
person, bound him hand and foot, cut off his privy member,
and put hot ashes in the <HI>scrotum,</HI> and then carried him on
horseback to a house at some distance, where in a few days
he died. Stewart was convicted and beheaded.</P>
<P>THUS it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lethal Weapon, if essential to the Charge.</NOTE> that it would be fruitless to set on foot
an inquiry, in which however some commentators have em∣ployed
much time and labour, concerning the nature of the
<PB N="400" REF="459"/>
several weapons, what are, and what are not to be repu∣ted
lethal. Thus far there is a difference in weapons, that
there be some, such as swords and fire-arms, which carry
absolute and uncontroulable evidence of the mortal purpose,
in every case where they are used; and in this sense it may
be not improper to distinguish these as lethal. But that
there is any weapon of so harmless a kind, that in every
case, and in all circumstances, it must be held to have been
used without a mortal purpose; this is an absurdity in itself,
and cannot be maintained without a plain perversion of the
term. The answer is, that the weapon must be lethal, by
which a man has died; that a man was actually killed with
this weapon, in this case; and that whether it was or was
not used with a mortal or highly injurious purpose, is a
matter which cannot be determined on bare sight of the wea∣pon,
but on the way of using it, the repetition of the blows,
the comparative age and strength of parties, the words ut∣tered
on the occasion, and all other particulars of the
story. Wherein, if on the whole there be evidence of a
mortal or very malignant purpose, the circumstance of an
unlikely weapon may be outweighed, like any other. That
weapon has actually killed; it might be intended so to do;
and it must be shewn <HI>idoneis argumentis,</HI> on the part of the pan∣nel,
that this was not the case. For this rule we may quote
the Divine law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers, c. 35. ver. 16. 18. 21.</NOTE> by which he who smites with a throwing
stone, or with a hand-weapon of wood, wherewith a person
may die, is to be held a murderer, and to be put to death.
And again, still more explicitly, “if in enmity he smite
him with his hand, that he die, he that smote him shall
surely be put to death, for he is a murderer.”</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="460"/>
THE practice of Scotland has in all times been governed
by these rational,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lethal Weapon, if essential to the Charge.</NOTE> and indeed necessary rules, without which
men would enjoy a very imperfect protection of their
lives. To mention a few instances, out of a great number
which it were equally tedious as useless to recite. On the
10th November 1606, Patrick Deanes was condemned to die
for the murder of his wife, and a child in her womb, done
by striking her with his foot on the belly, and with a swingle∣tree
on the back; of which strokes she and the child imme∣diately
died.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1613.</NOTE> Libel was found relevant against Hugh Som∣merville,
for slaughter committed by several strokes given
on the side, shoulders and belly, with a girth-sting, or strong
baton; and against Matthew Culdie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 10. 1616.</NOTE> for slaughter, by strik∣ing
on the head with a flail;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3. 1631.</NOTE> and against Ker in Edderstone,
for killing by the stroke of a <HI>kent</HI> (or staff) on the head. In
the case of Alexander Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1. 1679.</NOTE> the charge was thus, “that
he did invade and assault the deceased Alexander Falco∣nar,
his fellow soldier, and did most cruelly beat, wound,
and bruise him in several places of his body, of the whilk
strokes, wounds and bruises he languished, by the space
of—hours, and thereafter died;” and on this charge
the pannel had sentence of death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8. 1693.</NOTE> As had William Aird,
on a charge to this effect: that he had assaulted Agnes
Bayne, when standing at the entrance of her cellar, had re∣peatedly
kicked her on the side, pushed her backwards down
stairs, and having followed her into the cellar, there renew∣ed
the same sort of violence upon her as she lay; through
which she fainted, fell into a cold sweat, and next day died.
In this case it was farther pleaded for the pannel, who was a
soldier, that he had a sword upon him, which he did not
draw, nor make use of.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="461"/>
NEARLY a-kin to this, was the case of William Graham,
indicted for the murder of William Reid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April. 11. 1699.</NOTE> his servant; ha∣ving
beaten him down with many strokes upon the steps of a
stair, and there trodden upon him, to the discolouring and
crushing of his body, and the effusion of his blood within him,
so that he could hardly creep to his father's house; which
having reached with much difficulty, he there lay, swooning
and vomiting blood, daily, and almost hourly, until he ex∣pired,
about three weeks after the time libelled. This
charge went to trial, as relevant to infer the pains of
death. But the pannel was not convicted. On the 17th
June 1700, a libel was found relevant against Richard
Carse, to infer the pains of death, of which the charge
was thus: “You the said Richard Carse beat and wound∣ed
the said Thomas on the head or face, or elsewhere,
of which beating and wounding, he fell ill, and languished
two or three days, and in the wound, after he was dead,
was found a long piece of stick<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It appears from the proof that the pannel had struck the deceased on the head with a wooden dish or <HI>qucich,</HI> and that a splinter detached itself, and entered the skull at the eye, and broke off, short. The jury sound a special verdict; but the pannel made his escape before sentence.</NOTE>, which was taken out
from under his skull.” In the case, likewise, of Burnet
of Carlops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. &amp; 29. 1711.</NOTE> the libel went to trial, as for a capital pain,
though the beating was with a cane and broomstaff, and by
persons who had swords upon them; on which ground it was
argued, that they could not have intended to kill<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>The prosecutor answered, “Though the beating with one hand, or with a rod or staff, does presume that there was no intention to kill; but still there may be other circumstances, that are wholly inconsistent with the foresaid presump∣tions, and from which the <HI>animus occidendi</HI> may be as clearly inferred, as if a deadly weapon had been made use of. For as it cannot be contraverted that one may beat to death, by repeated strokes or blows of such weapons as the law does not call deadly, so the <HI>animus occidendi</HI> is as necessary to be inferred where such a continued beating is qualified, as where a mortal weapon is made use of, and even may be justly said to have a degree of more malice in it, as it is not sudden, but of longer continuance, and consequently more malicious than the other.”</P>
<P>Again, in answering certain decisions, he says, “In all of them it is evident, that that which happened was contrary to intention, and that there was no more but one single stroke given; whereas, in the present case, the repeated and continued strokes do take away the presumption naturally arising from the nature of the weapon.”</P></NOTE>. These
<PB N="403" REF="462"/>
persons also were acquitted. But it was otherwise in the
case of James Brown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. and Aug. 4. &amp; 5. 1735. Dec. 16. 1771.</NOTE> who suffered death for the murder of
a woman by striking her with the hand, and treading her
under foot; and in the case of James Baillie, who had sen∣tence
of death for the murder of his wife, by beating her
with the handle of a whip, tumbling her body down a steep
bank, and again beating and kicking her, so that she died.
As also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1773.</NOTE> John Brown and James Wilson, were convicted and
suffered death for the murder of Adam Thomson, done by
beating him with an oak stick, and a potatoe dibble.</P>
<P>WHAT is stronger than any of these instances;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lethal Weapon, if essential to the Charge. June 29. 1664.</NOTE> libel was sus∣tained,
as formerly mentioned, against Malcolm Brown, miller
in Lennox-mill, for killing a boy by a blow on the ear, with
his fist<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Unde et ex lege Cornelia de sicariis merito dixeris teneri cum, qui cujus∣cunque conditionis hominem, &amp;c. … et quocunque instrumenti genere, dolo malo occidit, vel etiam sine ullo instrumento extrinsecus assumpto, dum vel pugnis vel capitis impetu aut calcibus ictis et conculcationibus, &amp;c. … homi∣cidium dolo malo factum probetur.” Voet ad L. Corn. de sicariis, No. 1.</NOTE>. And more lately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 29. 1748.</NOTE> in the case of William Lindsay,
<PB N="404" REF="463"/>
we have an instance of the same judgment given on the
like charge, relative to the killing of a grown man. The
libel relates that he assaulted John Love, “seising him by
the hair of the head, and giving him several blows,
bruises and wounds on the face or head, whereupon he called
out ‘that he had received sore strokes indeed,’ went home,
languished for two or three days and died<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel is silent as to the weapon with which the blows were given. But it is clear from the debate that they were given with the fist. The same appears from the proof; though some of the bystanders suspected that the pannel had something hard concealed within his hand. But this is neither said nor insinu∣ated in the libel.</NOTE>.” The libel
was laid for murder, and was found relevant to infer the
pains of law; but the verdict was in favour of the pannel.</P>
<P>ONE thing is to be observed of all cases where no instru∣ment
but the hand is used, that if the pannel, before striking,
have suffered any real provocation, this will materially affect
the construction of his deed. If John without cause assault
James, and violently and for a length of time beat him
with the fist, so that he dies; the law can presume no
other, but that he assaults with the wicked intent to do
some great bodily harm. But if he only strike in retali∣ation
of a severe blow, this will not be murder, though
James die; because the provocation excludes the suppo∣sition
of malignity. He intends indeed to hurt; but, be∣ing
assaulted in this manner, he is entitled to resent, as far
at least as goes to a few blows with the hand; and if
these are attended with any danger of James's life, he
is himself alone to blame for the event. In short, with re∣gard
to any act which a person hath right to do, law will
presume on his side while it can, that he does not intend the
<PB N="405" REF="464"/>
great and unlikely evil which ensues; but will require evi∣dence
against him, of one kind or other, that he means to kill
or to do some outrageous harm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 81. and p. 517.</NOTE> The case of Archibald was
of this description. It was shortly thus: that in the course
of a struggle, a person was killed with two blows of the fist
on the head, to the surprise of the bystanders, and in such a
manner, of which even on opening the head, no satisfac∣tory
account could be obtained. It was evident on the
whole circumstances of the case, that there was no mortal,
nor even highly injurious purpose on the part of the pannel;
and as he had received such provocation of blows from
the deceased, as in the opinion of the jury entitled him to
strike in the way he did, they found him not guilty of
the charge.</P>
<P>ON review of these judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Outrageous Pur∣pose, if essential to the Charge.</NOTE> it may perhaps be thought
of some of them, that they are inconsistent with others,
formerly mentioned, by which the relevancy was confined to
an arbitrary punishment; and that in particular there is this
repugnancy between the case of Aird in 1693, and of Rey∣sano
in 1724, who escaped with transportation, although,
like Aird, he had killed by pushing the person backwards,
down stairs. But if the circumstances of the two cases
be duly weighed, the judgments will appear to be nowise
inconsistent, or rather to be an apt illustration of the
doctrine which we have in hand. In Reysano's case the
parties were men, and there was but one blow or push given,
by which the deceased was thrown backwards, and at once
killed. Now this degree of violence might, and in itself was
rather presumable to be done, without a purpose to destroy.
Whereas in Aird's case, the repeated kicks, given by a man
to a woman, on the side, and the throwing of her down
<PB N="406" REF="465"/>
stairs, together with the following of her, and the renewal of
the same abuse of her person, after she had been disabled by so
severe a fall, left no doubt of a malignant and outrageous
purpose, if not to kill upon the spot, at least to do her some
dangerous and excessive bodily harm. One convenient il∣lustration
more of this distinction, is to be found in the pro∣ceedings
on the charge against Jean Ramsay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 24. 1713.</NOTE> for the mur∣der
of a sick and infirm person, who had ben found upon the
street, and carried into her habitation for assistance: “The
Lords found the pannel's violently dragging the defunct,
a weak and infirm person, out of the bed on which he was
laid, so that his head was bled on the bed-stock or floor,
and her beating of him on the side with a pair of tongs,
and her <HI>again</HI> dragging him out of another bed whereon he
was afterwards laid, and his dying within a few hours
thereafter, about the time libelled, jointly relevant to
infer the pains of death and confiscation of all goods and
gear; and found any of the foresaid facts separately rele∣vant
to infer an arbitrary punishment; and repelled the
haill defences proponed for the pannel.” In this, the
Court required a reiterated dragging from the bed, to raise
the case to murder. But the jury found as follows:
“Find that part of the libel anent dragging a weak, silly,
and infirm man out of bed, once in house, upon a
chest and floor, and thereby wounded and bled, and
that the said weak and infirm man was dead about eight
or nine of the clock next morning proven.” Now,
on this verdict, as not establishing the requisite degree of
violence, the pannel escaped with sentence of scourging, and
banishment from the county of her residence.</P>

I SHALL conclude this inquiry with a word or two concern∣ing
one situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a Wo∣man killed by Potion to pro∣cure Abortion.</NOTE> which, though somewhat different from the
others, seems, however, fit to be governed by the same rule.
If a man administer a potion to a woman without her know∣ledge,
in order to procure abortion; and if the composition
be of that powerful nature, as probably it will, to be attended
with a plain risk of life to the person who takes it, especi∣ally
when it is taken in this unguarded manner; and if the
woman in consequence die; this too seems to be nothing less
than murder. Because, though in a different way, he shews
the same disregard of her life and safety, and exposes her
to the same risk, as by doing outward violence to her per∣son.
A case of this sort was tried at Aberdeen on the 10th
May 1785; the case of Robert Dalrymple a flax-dresser, and
Robert Joyner a druggist. The fact, as alleged, seems to
have been, that these persons, having each of them a young
woman with child to him, they administered some violent
drug to them without their knowledge, (as was supposed for
the purpose of procuring abortion), in consequence of which
both the women died in the course of the same night. The
libel was laid, without any mention of the supposed purpose of
the prescription, as for murder by poison, with an alterna∣tive
of culpable homicide. The Court found it relevant to
infer the pains of law. Joyner was outlawed; and the libel
was found <HI>not proven</HI> against Dalrymple.</P>
<P>VII. THESE seem to be some of the most material consi∣derations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part of Murder.</NOTE>
towards ascertaining the description of the crime
of murder. I will now submit what has occurred to me,
concerning the several ways wherein a person may be art and
part of murder, and liable to the proper pains of that crime,
though the slaughter is not the immediate act of his own
<PB N="408" REF="467"/>
hand. This may either be by some part taken in the
perpetration of the deed, or by something done in prepa∣ration
or furtherance of the future act; for all these several
modes enter into the composition of our phrase of art and
part. It is with respect to the first sort of accession, that
the most frequent, though not perhaps the most difficult
questions of art and part arise. Yet even here cases of some
nicety may happen. For according to the views with which
the several persons meet, the share which they respectively
take in the doing of the deed, the certainty or uncertainty
of the mortal blow, and sundry other circumstances, they
may be all in the same or in very different degrees of guilt,
and may deserve higher or lower pains, or perhaps some of
them be entirely free of the crime.</P>
<P>1. ONE thing is plainly reasonable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Presence.</NOTE> and among all au∣thorities
agreed. That if a number conspire and lie in
wait, to kill a certain person, “<HI>si plures, non per rixae oc∣casionem,
sed premeditato concilio, in necem alicujus conjura∣verint,</HI>”
it signifies nothing by whom the mortal blows
are given, nor how few of them there be. Though but one
of the party strike, and dispatch with one blow of a lethal
weapon, he is not therefore the one actor on the occasion,
but executioner, for all of them, of their common resolu∣tion:
properly speaking he is their instrument with which
they strike, and they by their presence are consenting, aid∣ing,
and abetting to him in all that he doth; having all of
them come thither on purpose to have it done, and being rea∣dy
to lend their aid, if need shall be. Their presence on the
occasion is substantially an assistance. It adds to the terror,
confusion, and danger of the deceased, who against the as∣sault
of one only, without the appearance of company or
<PB N="409" REF="468"/>
support, might chance successfully to defend himself; as on
the other side the invader is heartened in the enterprise, by
his knowledge of the force provided to sustain him. James
Shaw had sentence of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 10. 1673.</NOTE> on a verdict which specifies
his presence at the murder, as the main ground of con∣viction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, by his own judicial confession of his being present at the said murder, and other presumptions, that he had accession thereto, and was guilty of art and part of the murder.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS rule is to be understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Presence.</NOTE> not only of those (com∣paratively
rare) cases, where an express and formal com∣pact
to kill can be proved, but equally of all, in which
from the number, arms, or behaviour and language of the
persons engaged, an implied and tacit confederacy may
reasonably be gathered. And with respect to the presence
of any associate; in this article also, I do not mean to
speak of real only and physical presence, by seeing the deed
done, but of that constructive presence which is sustained by
the law in many other cases; and according to which every
person shall be held to be present, who in any shape co-ope∣rates
in, facilitates, or protects the actual execution of the
slaughter. One, for instance, gives notice of the person's ap∣proach
by signal from a distance; a second, dispatches him at
a spot agreed on; and a third, takes post at a convenient
place to prevent interruption, or favour their escape: Cer∣tainly
all the three are in one degree of guilt. By the con∣struction
of law, they are all present, and participant of the
murder; because at the time of doing it, they are each of
them in his place, lending effectual aid to the perpetration
<PB N="410" REF="469"/>
of the deed; and but for this mutual assistance and encou∣ragement,
the attempt might not be made.</P>
<P>IT is also to be observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Presence.</NOTE> with respect to this rule of con∣victing
on the ground of simple presence, that it is not con∣fined
to those cases, where the murder is committed with
the proper instruments of slaughter. It is true, that where the
whole party are equipped in that fashion, at setting out on
the enterprise, or where some of them provide themselves
with arms, with the knowledge and consent of the others,
those circumstances are themselves evidence of the assent of
all of them to the felonious and mortal purpose. And it
must be granted, that if the deceased is not dispatched in
this manner, but by beating with a staff or the like; here,
with respect to any one who has not actually struck, (for
there is not otherwise any room for such a question), the
stronger proof will be required of his full association to the
previous confederacy, and of the high and dangerous nature
of the intended injury, or of his actual assent to what he
sees done at the time: or at least, the case will be more
open to a proof of favourable circumstances on his part; as
that he remonstrated with his associates, and did what in
him lay to restrain them from any dangerous excess. In the
case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 16. 1723.</NOTE> accordingly, of David Hume, which was of this pre∣cise
description; the slaughter having been done in the pre∣sence
of three persons, by beating the deceased with staves;
the Court, after hearing a full argument, found a relevancy
on the actual beating only by Hume, and not as libelled and
insisted for, on the beating by him, or by the other persons
in his presence. The reason was, that no strong circum∣stances
were laid in the libel, to infer his knowledge of any
felonious conspiracy to destroy or maim; and that the cause
<PB N="411" REF="470"/>
of quarrel was the affair of the other persons, rather than
his<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find, that David Home, pannell, having at the time and place lybelled, beat and wounded George Sweet, servant to John Horsely, possessor of Seton, of which stroaks or wounds, he the said George Sweet did soon thereafter dye, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of move∣ables.”</NOTE>. But still the difference between such cases, and that
of slaughter with the proper instruments of death, lies in the
matter of proof only, and no deeper. For if satisfactory
evidence be obtained of a deliberate plan to way-lay the de∣ceased,
and to kill, or to maim and disable him, by an out∣rageous
beating; certainly, in the event of his death, this is
murder in all who are participant of that purpose, and stand
by to see it executed, approving, or not interposing to hin∣der
the continuance of the outrage.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been said of simple presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Assistance in the Act.</NOTE> it is need∣less
to enlarge on those circumstances in the conduct of the
persons present, which shall be held to prove their assent to
the deed, or to amount to an assistance. In general, all such
behaviour as tends to impede, disconcert, or intimidate the de∣ceased,
in his defence, is as decisive against the pannel, as the
striking of a severe blow, or the doing of a direct injury to the
person.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 14. 1676.</NOTE> Thus in the case of David Hamilton of Auchtoul,
accused of the murder of Mair of Milntown<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This was a very cruel and unnatural case. The pannel and Mair were near relations. His son, Gavin Hamilton, sends Mair a written challenge, and goes to the field, provided with a horse and other equipment to assist him in his flight, if need shall be. Mean while, David, the father, goes to Mair's house, (who was a lad of nineteen), and by threats and insults, draws him to the field to fight, though reluctant. When arrived there, the other persons present endeavour to make peace between the parties; but David Hamilton insists that they shall fight, and sets them to. Mair, for a time, has the better in the combat, and wounds Gavin in the hand; on which friends again interpose, and Mair re∣tires. But the father succeeds in again setting them to, and strikes Mair on the side, as he is retiring, and tumbles him down. Having then got to the right of him, as he lay on the ground, so as to hinder his free use of his sword, he thus gives an opportunity to Gavin, who thrusts at Mair, under his father's arm and kills him. He was found guilty art and part, and condemned to be beheaded.</P>
<P>In the case of Robert Kennedy of Auchtifardale, (July 15. 22. 30. 1706.) The Court found it “relevant to be proven, that the pannel, after he saw his son Gilbert, with his sword drawn, did beat or strike the defunct with his stick or staff. or that the pannel immediately struck the defunct with his cane before the mortal thrust, so that the defunct's disorder by the said strokes did hinder him to defend himself against the thrust.” But this only to the effect of inflicting an arbitrary pain. The ground of this restriction was, that the pannel Robert Ken∣nedy, and the deceased were, at the time when the son drew his sword and killed, actually engaged in the heat and passion of a scuffle, in which they mutually beat each other with canes: So that there could hardly be evidence that the father, in this agitation, had so thoroughly understood and entered into his son's purpose of killing, as to make him an associate therein. The father might desist as soon as he saw the sword drawn, and yet the thrust follow so quickly, that the decea∣sed could not recover from his disorder; or he might strike after seeing it drawn, not conceiving that the son meant to kill, but only to separate them, or to pro∣tect his father by the show of the weapon. It was thus a quite different case, from that of interposing to strike one of two persons, already engaged in a mortal combat. It rather appears from the proof, that the pannel's back was turned to his son at the time he drew, and that the pannel did not observe it. The jury found to that effect, and he was assoilzied.</P></NOTE>, the Court
<PB N="412" REF="471"/>
finds the libel bearing the pannel's murdering and slaying
the defunct relevant; <HI>as also,</HI> that the pannel came to the
defunct's house, and did entice and persuade the defunct
to go to the fields with him, and that as the defunct was
standing to his defence against Gavin Hamilton the pan∣nel's
son, David the pannel, came behind the defunct and
tripped up his heels, whereby the defunct fell back to the
<PB N="413" REF="472"/>
ground, and as the defunct was lying on the ground, the
said Gavin did thrust him through the body, whereof he
died, relevant to infer art and part of the slaughter of
the defunct.”</P>
<P>ALL commands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part by E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion <HI>in ipso actu.</HI></NOTE> incitements, or exhortations to the deed,
if given upon the spot, and <HI>in ipso actu</HI> of the slaughter, are
in like manner, a clear ground of conviction of art and part.
Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 7. 1690.</NOTE> in the case of Alexander Maxwell and others, accu∣sed
of convocating in a church-yard, in arms, and attacking
a Presbyterian minister and his congregation, who had assem∣bled
for divine service, in the course of which afray, a person
was shot; this slaughter was found relevant, as well against
Maxwell who gave the command, (but in very strong terms),
to use the mortal weapons, as against the actual assailants<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 7. 1690. “Find the libel at the instance of the relict and children of John Russell, William Hay, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bearing Alexander Maxwell and the other pannels, their unwarrantable convocating and assembling several persons in arms, and commanding them to stab, stick and gore; and the mutilation, blooding and wounding of William Hay, John Murdoch, and others, and the slau <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hter of the said John Russell, relevant; the slaughter to infer the pain of death libelled, as well against them who gave command, as against the com∣mitters of the said slaughter; and the rest of the foresaid crimes libelled, <HI>sepa∣ratim</HI> to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>.
Reference may also be made to the case of Davis and Wilt∣shire,
in March 1740. These were two soldiers of a party,
who irregularly, and of their own authority, had stopped a
cart as loaded with smuggled wine. In the absence of the
others, who had gone to inform the revenue officer, a scuffle
arose between the pannels and the driver, insisting to drive
off his cart. In the course of this contest, the carter wrested
the musket from Wiltshire, who thereupon cried to Davis to
fire; which Davis did, and killed the carter. The verdict
<PB N="414" REF="473"/>
was thus: “Find it proven, that Thomas Davis pannel,
discharged a firelock at the deceased John Mather, where∣by
he received a mortal wound, of which he soon there∣after
died; and finds it likewise proven, that Charles
Wiltshire, the other pannel, desired the said Thomas Da∣vis
to fire; but does not find the exculpation proven.” Af∣ter
hearing an argument on this verdict, the Court pronoun∣ced
sentence of death on both the pannels.</P>
<P>2. WHAT has been said of slaughter committed in pursu∣ance
of a concert to kill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Murder done in purinance of another Felony.</NOTE> or to do some grievous bodily harm,
seems to be equally true of slaughter done in prosecution of
any other felony; provided the nature of the attempt im∣ply,
or the behaviour and proceedings of the parties indi∣cate,
an unity of purpose in all concerned, and a resolu∣tion
to controul all resistance of their enterprise by force.
If several go out together, armed, to rob on the highway,
and one of them kill in the assault, it is murder in all those
of the party who are anywise aiding in this robbery, whe∣ther
present on the spot or not. For they are all there under
a compact of mutual support; and the slaughter is an obvious
and not unforeseen consequence of the assault, to rob: else
why go they out provided with arms? The like judgment
will be due, if a number be engaged in a house-breaking, and
one of them kill a person in the house, whether to subdue
resistance or make good his escape: even those who ne∣ver
enter the house, but only watch without, to prevent sur∣prise,
are here guilty of the murder. Or again; put
the case that a score of persons have assembled to rescue a
cargo of smuggled goods, which are in the course of con∣veyance
by the revenue-officer, and that they proceed for
this purpose, all or most of them provided with fire-arms. If,
<PB N="415" REF="474"/>
in the prosecution of this felonious enterprise, the revenue∣officer
or any of his party be killed, all the confederates
are answerable for it with their lives. For why come
they there armed, and in numbers, but in the expectation of
resistance, and in preparation to overcome it? All are
there at the time in a mutual league of defence and sup∣port,
by force of arms, in their unlawful project; and
it is by the deed of all and each of them, in pursuit of
their common object, that the immediate actor has been
brought into that situation which has tempted him to kill. It
is on their account, as much as his own, that he has made use
of his arms. He does so, to protect their persons, and promote
their enterprise, in which he has no deeper interest than the
others, and which, if he were left single, he would certainly
abandon. Were it not for their company, he would not be
on the expedition; if others had not brought arms with
them, neither would he; and it is to their power, and their
disposition to assist him, that he trusts when he makes use of
his weapon.</P>
<P>STATING the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Murder done in a great Assem∣bly.</NOTE> however, of a very numerous assem∣bly;
it is more especially necessary to attend to the terms
in which our rule has been guarded, namely, that the as∣sembly
be of that kind, in which a plain unity of pur∣pose
and temper of mind may be observed. For otherwise;
as in the case of a great mob, or riotous convocation, which
consists of persons who assemble from different quarters,
without previous concert, and variously equipped, as well as in
various tempers of mind, and for objects of very different
degrees of guilt, justice requires an investigation of the con∣duct
of each individual; in order that a judgment may be
formed with respect to him, according to the style of his
<PB N="416" REF="475"/>
equipment, the language he holds, and the part he acts on
the occasion, whether he is to be deemed an accomplice in
any slaughter which ensues, or not. It is indeed true, that in
the case of James Learmonth and William Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11. &amp; 13. 1678.</NOTE> the one
circumstance of presence in arms at a very numerous meet∣ing
where a man was killed, seems to have been judged a
sufficient ground of conviction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor. “The Lords Commissioners of Justiciary having considered the libel and debate, find the libel, reply, and triply proponed by his Majesty's Advocate, <HI>viz.</HI> presence at the unlawful meeting of the field coventicle libel∣led, with arms, at which the slaughter was committed; <HI>or</HI> giving counsel or command in the words condescended upon in the debaté, <HI>viz.</HI> ‘Let there be no cowards here the day, Sirs, and let these that have arms go out be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore,’ or the like expressions, relevant; and remits the same to the knowledge of the assize.”</NOTE>, as art and part of the
slaughter. And cases may doubless be imagined, where such
a judgment shall be unexceptionable; the case, for instance
of a treasonable rising in arms. Because the insurgents
are combined on the precise principle, of executing their
purpose by force and slaughter; so that all who are in
the field in arms, are art and part of all the depreda∣tions,
slaughters, and other mischiefs attending on the state
of war, that are committed in their presence. It may
also be suitable to such a case as that of the Porteous mob;
in which, to the tumult and disorder; there was joined a
pointed and special purpose of revenge and slaughter against
a certain person; whereof all who came equipped and as∣sisted
with arms, might reasonably be held to be partakers.
But the charge in the case of Learmonth and Temple was
thus. That they and their accomplices, to the number at
least of a thousand, and many of them armed, had assem∣bled
for a field preaching or conventicle, on the hills of
<PB N="417" REF="476"/>
Whitekirk, within sight of his Majesty's garrison of the
Bass; and that the governor of that place having sent out a
party of soldiers against them, they treacherously, after
promising to disperse, had set upon the party, some of
whom they wounded, and killed one. It appears that this
person was killed with a single blow of a halbert; and it was
not alleged, that either of the pannels struck the blow, or
invaded the man. Now on such an occasion as this, persons
might be present in arms from very different motives; some
in consequence only of the fashion of the times to wear
arms, some for self-defence in case of personal assault on
themselves, others <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to prevent disturbance by the
show of force, and a few perhaps with hostile purposes, and
prepared for slaughter on any molestation. The mere pre∣sence
in the conventicle with arms, was, however, explicitly
found relevant to infer guilt of the slaughter. Learmonth
was convicted of exhorting to resistance, and had sentence
of death. Temple was convicted of presence with a sword,
but undrawn, near the spot where the slaughter was commit∣ted;
and he only escaped the capital punishment which would
have followed in terms of the interlocutor, owing to inter∣cession
made for him with the Lords of Privy Council. But
this is a precedent taken from an arbitrary period, and rela∣tive
to an offence in which the State took a great and un∣due
concern; beside that the judgment appears to have
been much commented on, even at the time when it was
given<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Fountainhall's acount of this case, vol. i. p. 12. 13. Also Mackenzie's Vindication of Charles ll.'s Government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN every thing that has been said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if Slaugh∣ter, not in pur∣suance of the common Object.</NOTE> this limitation is implied,
That to affect all concerned, the slaughter must be done in
<PB N="418" REF="477"/>
pursuance of the common enterprise, in which the party are
engaged. For if it be done on some peculiar and accidental
quarrel of the slayer, which is not connected with nor sub∣servient
to the original design.; or, though it have some re∣lation
to that design, if a resolution of the whole party
to accomplish their object by such extreme means, cannot
reasonably be collected in the circumstances of the case;
in either of these situations all the reasons entirely fail, upon
which, by the construction of law, the act of one is carried
over into the persons of his associates. Such a case is that
mentioned by Foster<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Crown Law, p. 313.</NOTE>, of three soldiers who went out together,
to rob an orchard. Two got upon a pear-tree, and the third
stood at the gate, with a drawn sword in his hand. The
owner's son, coming by, collared the man at the gate, and ask∣ed
him what business he had there; and thereupon the soldier
stabbed him. It was ruled by Holt, that this was murder
in him who stabbed, but that those on the tree were inno∣cent.
They came to commit a small inconsiderable trespass,
and the man was killed on a sudden affray, without their
knowledge. It would, (said that able Judge,) have been
otherwise, if they had all come thither with a general reso∣lution
against all opposers.</P>
<P>3. THE more ordinary case of slaughter is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Cases of sudden Slaughter.</NOTE> that the felo∣nious
purpose is taken up on a sudden, upon fortuitous quar∣rel
among persons who were lawfully assembled for some
other object. And, in these circumstances, to convict any one
as art and part of the slaughter, evidence must be shown with
relation to him in particular, of such things done by him
as infer his adoption of the mortal purpose, and amount to the
rendering of assistance in the execution of it. On the 1st
<PB N="419" REF="478"/>
of April 1691, Captain Bruce and Lieutenant Arrot were
brought to trial, on charge of a tumultuous attack made by
them, along with others, on the city-guard of Edinburgh,
at their guard-house, in the course of which three soldiers
of the guard were killed. This was the issue of an acci∣dental
squabble with the guard, on the King's birth-day,
when bonfires were kindled, and the pannels, along with
other persons in liquor, were roaming through the streets, in
a disorderly manner, in the evening. It was thus obvious
that many might be present, and even in some measure en∣gaged
in the affray, out of curiosity or indiscretion, or at the
worst with no more criminal purpose than that of raising a
brawl in the street; and the Court thought it therefore just
to require evidence with respect to each of the pannels, of
his joining in the mortal assault, by thrusting at the guard
with a drawn sword<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">April 2. 1691. “Find the libel anent the slaughter of the said Henry Lincklatur relevant against Lieutenant David Arrot allenarly; and find the said libel as to the slaughter of Alexander Simpson and Colin Campbell relevant against both the pannels; and finds the said Lieutenant David Arrot his thrust∣ing at the guard with a drawn sword, relevant to infer art and part against him as to the slaughter of the saids three haill persons killed; and finds Captain James Bruce his thrusting at the guard with a drawn sword, relevant to infer art and part against him as to the slaughter of Alexander Simpson and Colin Camp∣bell allenarly.”</NOTE>. Nearly the same rule was followed
in the case of Captain John Price and five others:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24. 1690.</NOTE> of whom
the libel relates, that being in a tavern they quarrelled with
the people of the house, who sent for the guard to quell
them; whereupon they suddenly took up a purpose of re∣sistance,
shut the door of the house, and drew their swords
on the soldiers of the guard. At length, as the corporal
of the guard was entering, (having forced open the door),
<PB N="420" REF="479"/>
he was shot through the head by one or other of the party.
Here too the Court considered, that the pannels were inno∣cently
assembled at first, and that some of the party might re∣main
in the house rather from fear of the others, or want
of opportunity to retire, than from any concurrence in the
felonious purpose of resistance. They therefore required
evidence with regard to each, of his co-operation in the fe∣lony,
by striking at the guard, or otherwise opposing them,
or at least having his sword drawn against them<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 26. 1690. “The Lords find the libel anent the slaughter of the said deceased John <HI>Real,</HI> and the pannels their being art and part thereof, by each of them their striking at the guard. resisting or opposing them, or having drawn swords or pistols in their hands, rele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant to infer the pams of death.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN these instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Cases of sudden Slaughter.</NOTE> it was unknown by whose hand the
mortal blow had been given. But in the circumstances of
the fact, this uncertainty could not yield an argument for
mitigating the punishment of any one of the pannels, against
whom such a co-operation was proved. Because, in employ∣ing
the proper instruments of slaughter, they had all sub∣stantially,
though on a sudden, adopted the felonious pur∣pose;
were actuated by the same malignity; exerted them∣selves to one end; and effectually assisted the mortal
hand, whichever it was, by their combined attack; which
materially affected the terror of the deceased, and his a∣bility
to defend himself at the time. By whom the fa∣tal
blow was given, was indifferent in such a case, and
if known could not tend in any measure to relieve the
others; since the deed was equally that of the whole party,
as if it had been done on a more regular and deliberate
association. For with respect to a number of persons, as
with respect to one, it is immaterial as to the guilt of mur∣der,
<PB N="421" REF="480"/>
(if there be no sufficient provocation in the case), whe∣ther
the mortal purpose is of malice aforethought, or is only
conceived upon the spot. The deed in the case mentioned,
was therefore that of all who assailed with mortal weapons.
It has been seen, that in the case of Davis and Wiltshire,
a simple command or exhortation to fire was held to be re∣levant
against Wiltshire: much more would it have been so,
if Wiltshire had thrust with his bayonet, or had fired his
piece, though the mortal injury was done by Davis.</P>
<P>THE other side of the rule is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Cases of sudden Slaughter.</NOTE> that in such cases of sudden
slaughter, a person is not liable to any punishment, unless he
have in some measure been active in the assault. And in il∣lustrating this position, I shall consine myself to the single
case of Crief and Cordie, tried in February and March 1719.
The libel related, that the pannels, who were soldiers, when
standing at the door of their quarters, had thrown out
foul language against the deceased, and others in his com∣pany,
as they passed along the street; and that this being re∣torted, the pannels proceeded to blows. The issue was, that
one or other of them drew his bayonet, and gave a mortal
wound. The jury found that Cordie stabbed, and that both
had given scurrilous language<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Found it proven, that Neil Cordie, one of the pannels, gave a thrust with a drawn bayonet in his hand to John Anderson, in his left side of which he died the next day; and also finds, that John Crief and Niel Cordie pannels, gave scurrilous language to the said John Anderson and his company, such as saying,—There comes the blackguards and their whores.” March 3. 1719.</NOTE>. Now, on this verdict Cordie
was adjudged to die, and Crief was assoilzied <HI>simpliciter;</HI> ha∣ving
had no accession to any act of violence, far less to the
mortal purpose of his comrade.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="481"/>
THE class of cases which naturally connect with these,
are cases of slaughter committed in a sudden brawl or squab∣le
among a number of persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commissum.</HI></NOTE> and without employing
the proper instruments of slaughter; and to such cases I
understand the law-books to allude, in those passages which
make mention of <HI>homicidium in rixa per plures commissum,</HI> as
liable only to an arbitrary punishment. The reasons of
such a doctrine, will best be understood by the putting of a
common case; that two companies, both of them in liquor,
meet and quarrel on the streets of a town, in the dusk of the
evening. Words pass at first; and it soon comes to blows,
(owing commonly to the fault of both sides), with such in∣struments as the parties have upon them, or can lay hold of
at the time; and in this bustle a man is killed, it cannot be
said with certainty how, or by whom, but probably through
a succession of injuries inflicted by several persons. In
these circumstances, to punish every one capitally who is
proved to have struck, or at all to have invaded the deceased,
would be an unjust excess. Such a rule is indeed suitable in
the case of the deliberate way-laying of a single person by a
number; because each of the assailants sees, intends, and
measures the violence that is offered by the others; and all
is done in the direct prosecution of one wilful plan, to put
the sufferer in danger of his life. But in the case now put,
where the meeting, the quarrel, and the violence, are all sud∣den
and fortuitous, and where the deceased himself is probably
in some measure the cause of his own misfortune, these are
strong considerations in favour of the pannels. In such
situations the combat goes on confusedly, without any choice
of weapons or measures, and as chance wills, rather than with
any sort of conduct or guidance, and not only without any
<PB N="423" REF="482"/>
precise relation of the act of one to that of another, but
without any full knowledge on the part of any one of that
which the others have done; so as he may judge of the danger
or excess. If indeed it can be shown that the deceased was
destroyed by a certain more severe blow, given him by a par∣ticular
person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commissum.</HI></NOTE> this is quite a different case, in which it will
become matter of special inquiry with respect to that per∣son,
on the whole particulars of what he did, whether he
had a highly injurious purpose or not. But keeping to the
imagined case; that the death is caused by a succession of
injuries, or that the author of the mortal injury is unknown;
the result can only be to inflict an arbitrary pain on those
of the party who struck the deceased, and entirely to ac∣quit
the others, against whom no act of violence is proved.
One example of a homicide of this sort, is the case of George
Hutchieson and others, August 12. 1784. The charge was,
that the pannel and others were assembled in a disorderly
manner upon the street, where they insulted and molested
passengers; and that the deceased having interfered in be∣half
of some one who was abused, the pannels, “all and
each, or one or other of them,” gave him a mortal wound
on the head, with a stone, stick, iron-rake, or other offen∣sive
weapon, of which wound, after languishing about a
month, he died. The libel was laid as for homicide<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Where, by the laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> homicide, or the killing and slaying any of the lieges, by beating or otherwise wounding them, so as death follows; or the assaulting, bruising, or wounding any of the lieges to their bodily harm, to the effusion of their blood, and loss of their lives, in a violent, unlawful, and mastlerly manner; as also the riotously and wantonly assembling on the streets of a burgh, and beating of passengers, and raising disturbances and quarrels therein, are all,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, and
the prosecutor at calling restricted his conclusions to an ar∣bitrary
<PB N="424" REF="483"/>
punishment. The pannels were, however, acquitted
of the homicide, and found guilty of the riot; for which
they were ordered to be scourged.</P>
<P>WE have an older example of the same character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commissum.</HI> Jan. 8. 1711.</NOTE> in the
case of Archibald Burnet and John Loudon. These persons
being in company with two or three more, and an affray ha∣ving
arisen, in which Redpath, who was a stout man, had col∣lared
or laid hold of a stripling, who was a friend of the
pannels, blows had in consequence passed on the occasion;
and in particular the pannels had beaten Redpath, the
one with a cane, the other with a broom-staff, so that
his skull was fractured, and he died of the injury. The
Court found these circumstances relevant to restrict the libel
to an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel relevant to infer the pains libelled; and sustain this qualification of the libel, that the beating was <HI>per plures commissum,</HI> in conjunc∣tion with any of the two following defences, to wit, that any beating com∣mitted by them was in a tuilzie or <HI>rixa,</HI> in which they mixed themselves to relieve a youth in the defunct's grips, or in a struggle with him; or, <HI>separatim,</HI> that they had swords about them, and only made use of staves or batons, re∣levant to restrict the libel to an arbitrary punishment.” 22d Jan. 1711.</NOTE>. And upon verdict finding “that
the beating was <HI>per plures commissum,</HI> and that they both
had swords about them, and did not make use of them;”
the pannels were fined, and ordered to prison till payment.</P>
<P>CASES of this sort seem to be the most proper instances
of homicide <HI>in rixa per plures</HI> (i. e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commissum.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in turba seu tumultu pluri∣um</HI>)
<HI>commissum.</HI> But the same phrase has sometimes been
applied to situations, where in truth a felonious murder was
committed by some one, and with the proper instruments of
slaughter, but in such a way that neither could the actor be
fixed, nor the slaughter justly be imputed to all concerned.
<PB N="425" REF="484"/>
The case of Lindsay and Brock, according to the story told
in the libel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 15. 1717.</NOTE> was precisely of that description. They had
jostled Anderson as he passed them on the street; and in con∣sequence
a wrestling took place, in which Anderson was
thrown down, and the pannels came to the ground along with
him. Some struggle followed with them in that situation;
and when Anderson rose, he was seen to bleed profusely in
the neck, and was found to have received a deep cut
there, of which in a few minutes he died. The sheath of
a knife was found upon the spot where they had fallen, and
there was blood upon the face of the one pannel, and upon
the hand of the other. But the knife itself was not found
upon either of them; nor had either of them been ob∣served
to have such an instrument in his hand, or upon him,
in the beginning of the quarrel. The verdict of the jury
entirely exculpated Brock; and an act of indemnity hin∣dered
any judgment from passing on Lindsay. But if con∣viction
had been obtained in terms of the charge, the re∣sult
must have been to inflict an arbitrary punishment on
both; by reason of the uncertainty of the person who
gave the mortal wound. That both should escape all pu∣nishment
on that account, though it was certain that by
one or other of them the deceased had been <HI>feloniously mur∣dered,</HI>
would plainly have been unfit. And yet that both
should be punished with death, would have been utterly
unjust; since the mortal weapon had only been used by one
of them, who had taken up the purpose in the course of the
struggle on the ground; and this, for any thing that could
be gathered from the circumstances of the situation, with∣out
even the knowledge, and much less the assistance of the
other.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="485"/>
4. THE most favourable case of any to the pannel, for the
construction of these questions of art and part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of fortuitous Slaughter on a lawful Act.</NOTE> is where the
assembly is not only innocent, but for execution of thē law,
and in obedience to its orders. If a magistrate goes forth to
quell a tumult, and one of his <HI>posse,</HI> unnecessarily, and without
orders, strikes and kills; this is the peculiar act of the indivi∣dual,
from which no manner of blame or responsibility at∣taches
on the magistrate, whose purpose in going forth the
slaughter directly counteracts, by raising a greater tumult.
This rule was applied in the case of Mackintosh and Fle∣ming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1673.</NOTE>
accused of the slaughter of John and Robert Far∣quharson.
Fleming's defence was, that the slaughter happen∣ed
in the prosecution of a purpose to take the deceased with
caption; to which service he being called, had attended as
a witness, but without being anywise active in the slaugh∣ter.
The Court found with respect to Fleming, that simple
presence was not relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And as to the remanent dispute against Fleming, the Lords find. That simple presence is not relevant against him; but sustains the libel against the said Fleming, it being proven that he either killed or wounded the defunct Robert Farquharson, or assaulted him with arms, or behaved himself as an ag∣gressor, notwithstanding the messenger's execution bearing him to be a witness to the caption.”</NOTE>; and required a proof that he
had killed, wounded, or assaulted the deceased, or at least
had behaved as an aggressor.</P>
<P>VIII. IT is now time to pass on to the other mode of ac∣cession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession before the Fact.</NOTE>
which consists in things done previous to or in pursu∣ance
of the slaughter, without any (even constructive) presence
at the deed itself. 1. In regard to accession before the fact.
It is in the general obvious, that whosoever, being in the
knowledge of the mortal purpose, though contrived and ima∣gined
<PB N="427" REF="486"/>
by another, shall lend immediate and material aid to∣wards
the execution of it, is thus involved in the substantial
guilt of murder. He becomes partaker of the distinguish∣ing
character of the crime, the deliberate cruelty and ma∣lice,
or depravity of heart. He encourages the others to
the deed by his countenance and fellowship; and as far as
he facilitates or forwards the enterprise, he must be held
to be the cause why the thing is done; since the with∣holding
of these aids might have altered the time, place, and
manner, and chance of success of the attempt, or perhaps
might have hindered it from being made. The apothecary,
for instance, who prepares and furnishes the deadly drug, to
be applied by another to the person of his neighbour, truly
takes the most material step in the whole process, and re∣moves
the main obstacle to the perpetration of the murder;
and though not personally present at the administration of
his dose, has however his heart in the business as much
as his associate, and is equally deserving of the highest
pains. The same is true of him, who, by false pretences,
entices the victim to a place where he may conveniently be
set upon, and gives notice to others, to way-lay him; or
who lends the use of his house, as a convenient station
from which to fire on his neighbour, though he purposely
leave home on the day when the deed is to be done; or
who harbours the assassins there till the convenient season,
and accommodates them with arms suited to their design<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Opem serunt, qui cum crimini patrato non interfuerint, ferramenta tamen, tela, venena commodaverit, sciens enjus rei causa commodaret.” Mathaeus, Proleg. Chap. i. No. 11.</NOTE>,
or with disguises to do it in, or with money and horses, be∣fore
hand, to favour their escape. In the case of David
<PB N="428" REF="487"/>
Hay and John Thomson, for the murder of Hay's wife<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“Find the pannel David Hay guilty in terms of the libel, by administering poison to Helen Langrigg his spouse, of which, by the common report of the country, she died; and also finds the pannel John Thomson, commonly called Dr Thomson, guilty of having furnished the said David Hay with the poison administered; and therefore, by plurality of voices, finds him guilty art and part.”</P>
<P>In the case of Bisset and Currier, June 15. 22. 1705. the libel was found only relevant for arbitrary pain against Currier, by whom the poison was procured. The reason seems to have been, that the libel did not precisely charge, that she gave it to or procured it for Bisset, for the purpose of administering to the decea∣sed. The charge is only thus: “She the said Jean Currier did buy from David Millar, apprentice to Patrick Blair, apothecary in Dundec, an ounce of arse∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck unprepared, which she said, the was to make use of to kill a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that had bit her leg, <HI>which arsenick he the said William Bisset did get from the said Cur∣rier.</HI>”</P></NOTE>,
the jury found Thomson guilty of furnishing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. &amp; 17. 1692.</NOTE> and Hay of
administering the poison; on which verdict both had sen∣tence
to be hanged, and to have their heads cut off, and
affixed on the goal of Lanark. Reference may also be made
to the case of Muir of Auchindrayne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1611.</NOTE> who, having recei∣ved
a letter from the Tutor of Cassillis, acquainting him of
his intention to travel next day to Edinburgh, and request∣ing
Muir to meet him at a certain place on the way, gave no∣tice
of these things to Kennedy of Drummurchy, that he might
way-lay and kill him; which Kennedy accordingly did. For
this base deed, and for afterwards murdering William Dal∣rymple,
a boy who had been employed as a messenger on the
occasion, Muir had sentence of death. In like manner, Pa∣trick
Kininmount had a relevancy found against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. and Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE> on the
furnishing of swords and lighted candles towards a combat
<PB N="429" REF="488"/>
in or near his own house; in which one of the parties fell<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the first article of the libel, <HI>viz.</HI> the furnishing Petrie and Glassfoord with swords and lighted candles, whereby Petrie wounded said Glasfoord, and Glasfoord thereafter died, relevant to infer the pains libelled.” The libel concluded for the pains of death.</NOTE>.
This too was sustained, independently of the charge, also
made in the indictment, of the pannel having instigated the
parties to fight. The case was not prosecuted to an issue.</P>
<P>FOR what reason it was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession before the fact. July 29. and Aug. 5. 1695.</NOTE> I know not, that the like rele∣vancy
was not found in the case of James Edmonston. The
occasion of this trial was, that the Master of Rollo had been
killed by Graham of Inchbrakie, in their way from a house
where they had dined together, in company with Edmonston,
M'Naughton, the Laird of Clavage, and others. Edmonston
was Inchbrakie's friend and comrade; and, <HI>as the libel told the
story,</HI> (but it was not fully supported by the proof), Inchbra∣kie
having insulted Rollo at table, Edmonston abetted him in
his rudeness. The two whispered to each other at table,
and Edmonston was heard to say to the other, “<HI>I would
not baulk him, Inchie.</HI>” They then left the room, were
absent for a while, and returned. In the evening, after
supper, the whole party left the house together, and took
the same road on horseback. At a certain spot, however,
Edmonston and Inchbrakie parted for a short space from
the others; and Edmonston having unloosed his sword-belt,
gave his sword to Inchbrakie, who had none upon him.
Rollo and Inchbrakie then fell behind the party, by them∣selves;
and in a short time the others, riding on at some
distance, heard the clashing of swords. On turning back, they
find Rollo wounded and dying. Clavage exclaims, “<HI>O what
<PB N="430" REF="489"/>
a foul murder!</HI>” and Edmonston answers, “<HI>I think not so,
but that it was fairly done.</HI>” He then exchanges his hat with
Inchbrakie, who flies; and next morning, Edmonston's
sword and that of the deceased are found upon the spot. All
these qualifications were found only relevant to infer an
arbitrary pain. A special verdict was returned, convicting
him of certain only of the circumstances libelled, (as indeed
there seems to have been no proof of more); and he was ba∣nished
Scotland for life.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession before the Fact.</NOTE> which is single of
its kind, it seems to be true of all cases, where the as∣sistance
consists in furnishing the immediate means of do∣ing
the deed, those means without which it either would
not be done at all, or at least would be done after quite
a different manner, that they are proper cases of art
and part. I say the immediate means of doing the deed.
For if the assistance be only indirect and remote, this,
though accompanied with the knowledge in general of the
actor's malice and evil design, cannot safely be made the
ground of conviction. Put the case, that John reveals to
James his purpose of revenge against a certain person, their
common enemy, who resides at a distance; and that James
lends him a horse for the journey, or gives him money at his
request, to carry him to that quarter of the country. Some
weeks after, James is informed that the person in question
has fallen; but as to the circumstances of his death, and the
particular contrivance of his destruction, these he only learns
from common fame, after the thing is done. Though highly
blameable in the part he has taken, he is not, however, pu∣nishable
capitally, as art and part of the murder. The reason
is, that what he has done, is no part, properly speaking, of
<PB N="431" REF="490"/>
the contrivance or story of the slaughter, which alone is the
matter of the charge and trial. It is true, he has assisted the
<HI>man,</HI> and helped him into a possibility of attempting this ho∣micide.
But he is not, and cannot be accessary to the par∣ticular
deed of slaughter, whereof the notion as to its time,
place, and manner, and all the circumstances of its descrip∣tion,
was not so much as formed, at the season when he gave
his assistance. For aught that he knew, the felonious pur∣pose
had been laid aside, or never had been seriously enter∣tained.
And though his aid has been of service to the actor
at one period, in bringing him into the situation where the
thing might be contrived and done; yet it in nowise entered
into the immediate act of contrivance or execution, so as
to prompt, relieve, or assist the persons engaged. It is also
to be considered, on the part of the remote assistant, that he
has not passed through the same trial of his malice and de∣termination,
as the principal actor and his immediate coad∣jutors;
never having felt the terrors, agitations, and alarms,
that await on the last hours of consultation in such enter∣prises,
when there is just time, and no more, to repent and to
desist<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><L>“Between the thinking of a guilty thing,</L>
<L>And the first moments of the execution,</L>
<L>All is combustion; and the state of man</L>
<L>Suffers the nature of an insurrection.” <HI>Shakespeare.</HI></L></NOTE>. He has not, like them, had the deed made present
to his imagination, by knowledge of the detail with which
it is to be done; nor had the same opportunity as they, of
being shaken with fear for himself, or with pity for the des∣tined
victim. They have persisted, not withstanding these vi∣sitations
of nature; but he has been put to no such test of his
heart and temper, and ought not therefore to be judged as that
same hardened and unpardonable offender, of whom no hope
<PB N="432" REF="491"/>
can be entertained. Besides; with respect to all aid of this re∣mote
description, aid that is referable to the man, rather
than to the special act; its connection with the issue, and
the share which it contributes to the prosecution and success
of the attempt, is too conjectural and uncertain a matter, to
be a safe ground of judgment in these questions of life and
death. Whereas, in that which palpably is subservient to
the particular plan, the associate knows how far his assist∣ance
is material, and testifies, by affording it, his final reso∣lution,
and his desire of the event.</P>
<P>AND here I am led to observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession before the Fact.</NOTE> that to be sustained as a
ground of art and part, the assistance must not only be im∣mediate,
but it must be material too; such as substantially
forwards, and encourages to persevere in the enterprise. For
if it only relate to some insignificant particular, in which the
actor might easily be accommodated otherwise, or which, if
refused, would neither hinder the deed, nor materially alter
the manner of it; then cannot the rendering of this service be
construed as a participation of the contrivance or execution
of the slaughter, nor as a proof of any thing but a degree
of favour to the enterprise that is afoot. To descend to
particulars: If the pannel lent the assassin his watch, that
he might know the hour, (having to lie in wait for the de∣ceased),
or told him the nearest road to the lurking place,
or gave him victuals to sustain him on his way thither; no
one of these things, <HI>per se,</HI> seems to be a sufficient ground
of conviction.</P>
<P>2. ONE may also be art and part of murder before the fact,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part, by Order to kill.</NOTE>
(though it cannot be a frequent case), simply by command∣ing
to do the deed, without any farther part taken in the
<PB N="433" REF="492"/>
prosecution or maturing of the enterprise. An officer
of the army, for instance, (if such a thing could hap∣pen),
who on report brought to him by his inferior offi∣cer,
gives him orders to fire on the populace molesting
his party, is equally answerable for the consequence, (if
the firing cannot be justified on the state of the case), as
if he personally commanded the party. That he has been
deceived with respect to the nature of the situation, is no ex∣cuse;
for he ought to go to the spot and be convinced of
the necessity by his own observation, before he give any ab∣solute
order in a matter of this importance. The same will
hold with respect to the magistrate, conveying rash orders
to the officer, on the like occasion. It is upon the like
ground, that the Judge is equally answerable as the inferior
ministers of the law, to whom his warrant is addressed, in
case of the execution of his illegal sentence of death.</P>
<P>IN cases like these, the relative situation of the parties is
a good reason, why the act of slaughter ought to be at the
hazard of the person who gives the order. But lawyers
have said, that the same will even hold in other cases of
command, so it be urgent and authoritative, and issued to
such persons who on the whole may reasonably be supposed
to be under its influence, though they be not truly bound to
the same discipline, and implicit obedience, as in the situ∣ations
above mentioned. Between parent and child, for in∣stance,
or husband and wife, and perhaps, in some quarters
of the country, master and servant, or chieftain and clans∣man,
cases may be imagined, (though they would need to
be strongly circumstanced, and in truth none such have
ever been the subject of trial), in which the order given, and
immediately obeyed, may of itself be a ground of con∣viction.
But it will very seldom happen, that such an order
<PB N="434" REF="493"/>
is not accompanied with circumstances of assistance, or other
concern in the deed, less or more, to strengthen the charge;
which too is not so favourable a sort of charge in the present
state of the manners and habits of the country, as it may have
been in former times. In the short memorandum relative
to the case of Alexander Home and Margaret Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 14. 1558.</NOTE> (but
of what crime accused is not said), the Justice finds, “That
the words of the causing command assistance and ratiha∣bition,
is of the same substance as art and part<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is extracted from the MS. Abridgment in the Advocate's Library, vol. 1. p. 45.</NOTE>.” In
the case too of Mackintosh, in June 1673, the Court de∣clared,
“That command and hounding out in general falls
under the compass of art and part in such cases.” At
the same time they found “that the particular qualifica∣tions
of command and hounding out mentioned by the
pursuers in the dispute, are not relevant to extend to man∣date,
or hounding out, to found a criminal pursuit.” As
mentioned by Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, tit. Art and Part, No. 4.</NOTE>, the reason of this judgment was,
that the words of command to kill, though strong, were
however in this respect ambiguous, that they might only re∣late
to the case of the deforcement of the messenger, along
with whom the pannel sent his sons to execute the caption.</P>
<P>3. ANOTHER case of order or mandate which is certainly
relevant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by hiring to kill.</NOTE> (and this though there be no bond nor relation be∣tween
the parties), is that of order accompanied with the gi∣ving
of a bribe, or hire, to do the deed. For the actor is here
to be considered only as an instrument in the hand of the
employer.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="494"/>
4. THE article in this department which seems chiefly to
be liable to controversy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Counsel to kill.</NOTE> is that of accession by counsel
or instigation; which, according to some authorities, is
of itself sufficient to subject the adviser to the pains of
murder. Certain things may be observed, on the one and
the other side, which will at least serve to circumscribe
the debate. It must be yielded, with respect to that sort
of counsel which is not purely such, but truly amounts
to a share in the contrivance of the deed, that this is
ground of conviction as art and part. He, for instance,
who not only exhorts and urges in general to do the
slaughter, but proceeds to show how easily and how safely
it may be done in a certain way, or at a certain time and
place, and opens the detail of a contrivance for execution
of the purpose, which plan is accordingly followed, may
justly be accounted one of the most important persons in the
story, though he leave the entire execution to his associates.
An address of this kind is not a naked advice, which has
no effect on the person to whom it is given, farther than as a
coincidence of wishes, but is in truth a most substantial assist∣ance,
which may be of as much service towards the perpe∣tration
of the deed, and may as much determine the actor to
the attempt, as even the promise of presence at the fact.
The adviser here equips the actor for the business; <HI>instruit con∣cilio;</HI>
and is the life and source of the enterprise. The case,
already mentioned, of Muir of Auchindrayne, was in some
measure of this description; because the pannel had not only
instigated the actor, but had advertised him of the convenient
time and place, when the deed might with certainty be done.
Perhaps it is with reference to this sort of counsel, <HI>concilium
cum ope,</HI> that some of those authorities are to be understood,
which speak of instigation, (or <HI>hounding out</HI> as it is termed
with us), as amounting to art and part.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="495"/>
IT is no less plain on the other part, with respect to any
advice which does not favour of assistance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Counsel to kill.</NOTE> that is must at
least be very serious, urgent, and pointed, to bring it under
the compass of art and part. No proclaiming of it as a
meritorious thing to destroy the deceased; no words of mere
permission or allowance to do the deed; no intimation of
thanks or approbation if it shall be done; not the strongest
expressions of hatred to the deceased, nor the most earnest
wishes for his death: none of these things come up to
what the law in this matter requires. Because, though
wrong and blameable, they are, however, all of them, no∣thing
more than the expression of the party's own distempered
state of mind; which may indeed tend to infect others with
the same evil disposition, and to make them susceptible
of mischief; but still has no relation to any special at∣tempt
or immediate course of action, nor is even a certain
proof of that settled habit of mind in the speaker, which
would make him join in any such enterprise, if it were ac∣tually
afoot. This rule is exemplified in the case of Bar∣bara
Coutts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 97.</NOTE> where, though a capital relevancy was found
on the general charge of art and part, yet her particular ex∣pressions
of rage and hatred against the deceased, though
very bitter and malignant, were found to be only punishable
in some inferior way. In short, the only counsel which can
plausibly be maintained to come under the intendment of the
law in this matter, is a direct and special counsel; a persua∣sion
to kill by use of the topics calculated to work on the
particular man, and relative, less or more, to some near oc∣casion
of doing the deed; whereby to excite him to an im∣mediate
course of measures towards the slaughter.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="496"/>
EVEN with respect to this sort of counsel, if in any case
it is to be sustained to involve in the pains of the principal
offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Counsel to kill.</NOTE> it is at least under provision, that the counsel
have been the slayer's main incitement and spring of action;
that circumstance in the case, without which the deed would
not have been done. For if John, bearing malice to
James, lay a plan to kill him, and communicate this to
George, who encourages and confirms him in his purpose,
but without lending any sort of aid, George cannot be pu∣nished
as author of the murder. It is thus a material consi∣deration
in all such cases, In whose quarel was the deed
done? in that of the adviser or the actor? If in the ac∣tor's
quarrel, certainly the just presumption will be, (for
to this we must have recourse in the impossibility of tracing
the truth), that in a matter so interesting to him he was
mainly determined by his own passions and impressions, and
would have acted as he did, if he had been left to himself.
The bare advice, without proffer of comfort or assistance,
cannot reasonably be supposed to controul the will of a free
and independent person on such an occasion, where all the
labour and all the risk of the enterprise is to be his own. If,
on the contrary, it can be shown that the quarrel was
the adviser's business, or the common concern of both,
this is a circumstance on the other side. And if it be
strengthened with other considerations, such as the depend∣ence
of the actor on the adviser, or the known ascendency
which the adviser has over him; possibly such a case may
be made out, (though none such has yet been tried), as
shall fix the guilt on the adviser, as author and imaginer
of the deed. Put the case, for instance, (though per∣haps
not the most likely to happen), of a young wo∣man,
instigated by the father of a natural child with
<PB N="438" REF="497"/>
which she is pregnant, to destroy it on the birth. Let us
suppose, that his letters to her are recovered, in which he
opens the purpose to her; insists on the evil consequences
of a discovery of her situation; persuades her how easy to
be done, and to be concealed; and by artful arguments pal∣liates
the wickedness of the proposal. In return to these,
suppose her letters also to be recovered, at first rejecting the
purpose with horror, and in the sequel bearing the history
of her gradual and reluctant compliance on his account, and
won over by his influence and importunity. If such a case
could happen, without some farther circumstance of aid
or contrivance on the part of the man; perhaps it might
be held to possess all those qualities which are naturally
requisite in an advice, to bring it under the description of
art and part. But it is obvious, that a case of pure and
simple advice, possessed of all those qualities, and in which
the history of the guilt is at the same time capable of being
substantiated by proof, is rather supposed for the sake of il∣lustration,
than likely to be the subject of trial.</P>
<P>WE may now dismiss these cases of hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Man∣date, &amp;c. to kill, retracted.</NOTE> command, and
counsel, after making this observation, which is appli∣cable
alike to all of them; that the mandant, adviser,
or so forth, can only be liable as art and part, if in truth
the slaughter is done under the influence of his commission
or advice. If he repents him of his purpose, and comes
to the actor to retract his command, and seriously does all
that in him lies to dissuade from and hinder the deed;
though the actor should persist, whether because his heart
is now full of enmity, through his long meditation on the
subject, or that he <HI>will</HI> do it to be revenged of the mandant,
and make him guilty by prosecution of his order in spite
<PB N="439" REF="498"/>
of him, he is at least free of the guilt of murder: though
he never can entirely wipe out the stain he has contracted,
by proceeding to so hazardous a length against his neigh∣bour.
Again; if the case be that the mandant has only
meant to retract his commission, but in truth has not done
it, though only owing to an accident, such as the loss of a
letter or the like; he has then no advantage by his altered
purpose: For it is still true, that on his mandate this
murder has been committed. He is the cause why any
such accident is of moment in the case; and at his hazard
it must therefore be, if, by any means, his order is not coun∣termanded,
but runs on, and comes to an issue. He has laid
and kindled the train, and he must break it off at his peril.</P>
<P>BY the same rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Mandate to injure follow∣ed with Death.</NOTE> it will not even acquit the mandant,
that the slaughter has been committed without his express
order, if it be the natural and probable consequence of that
which he commanded to be done: As if he order John to
waylay and violently beat James, and John beat him so
that he dies; or if he order John to rob James, and on his
resisting, John kill him on the spot. In all such cases, ha∣ving
authorised a great and dangerous wrong, he must an∣swer
the ordinary concomitant hazards, which he might
and ought to have considered, just as in any crime commit∣ted
by himself in person. There is the same reason, why no
variation from the command should free the giver, if it is
only a variation in the circumstance and manner, and not in
the substance of the act; as if the person be knocked on the
head instead of being shot according to the order, or if on
command to kill him on such a day at such a place, and
this opportunity being lost, he is killed some days after, and
at the next convenient station.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="499"/>
BUT what shall be said, if there is a variation in the per∣son
killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Vari∣ation from the Order to kill.</NOTE> by dispatching one person instead of another,
against whom alone the mandate was? Foster seems well to
have resolved this question by a distinction. If John have
hired James to poison such a one, whom James well knows,
and James, choosing rather to execute his own enmity,
give the poison to another; there can be no good reason why
John should answer for this event with his life. The link is
wanting here between the act and the order. James, at
applying the poison, is in nowise under the influence of
John's order, but only uses it as the occasion of executing a∣nother
and quite a distinct crime, which in the wickedness of
his own heart he has conceived, and wilfully grafted on it.
But if John hire James, to lie in wait for George at a cer∣tain
place by night, and William, happening to pass at the
appointed hour, is killed by James, who mistakes him for
George; this is quite another case, and such as affords John
no manner of plea for relief. The mortal blow has been
given under the influence of his warrant and instigation;
and the accidental variation which has happened, is just one
of those natural and probable hazards of the case, which the
contriver of the situation must run: Indeed the mistake might
equally have fallen out in his own hands, if he had been ac∣tor
as well as contriver. The snare he wickedly laid for
one, another, through his guilt, has fallen into, and perish∣ed.
The malice, therefore, adheres to him, and connects
with the actual, equally as it would have done with the in∣tended,
even. Doubtless, the actor also is answerable for the
deed of his own hand, which is equally wicked, whether
he kill the person intended, or another. In these observa∣tions,
I have followed the doctrine of the English authori∣ties<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 617.; Hawkins, b. 2. ch. 29. No. 18. <HI>et seq.;</HI> Foster. p. 370. 371.; Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 37.</NOTE>
<PB N="441" REF="500"/>
and chiefly of Hale and Foster; which is grounded in
natural and universal principles, and seems both to be more
reasonable, and more precise, than that which Mackenzie,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the authority only of the foreign doctors, and not of any
thing which has been settled by our own custom, has deli∣vered.</P>
<P>I SHALL not enter farther into a discussion of the many
possible questions concerning accessories before the fact;
but shall observe as a conclusion to the whole, that there
can be none such in culpable homicide on provocation,
nor in homicide in self-defence <HI>cum excessu moderaminis;</HI>
because it is in the nature of all such slaughter to be
done on a sudden, and in such a manner as excludes all pre∣vious
counsel or concert. It is possible, on the other hand,
to imagine cases, where the mandant, instigator, or con∣triver,
shall be answerable, and the immediate actor be
entirely free. As if an idiot or a madman be set on to
murder; or if one give a person poison through the hands of
his servant, which the servant administers, believing it to
be a safe medicine. The servant is innocent, but the furnish∣er
of the poison is guilty of murder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 15. 1705.</NOTE> This actually happen∣ed
in the case of Robert Bisset, who administered poison
to his wife by the hands of their servant Helen Jamieson,
to whom he delivered it as a medicine, which had come for
his wife from the apothecary. This servant was the chief
witness against him on his trial. But he was not convicted
to the full extent of the charge; and therefore escaped with
his life.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="501"/>
IX. THE only other sort of accession is by things done
after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession after the Fact.</NOTE> and in pursuance of the act of slaughter; such as con∣cealing
the dead body, approving the deed, harbouring the
actors, or enabling them to escape. It is clear, that, taken
along with previous knowledge of the purpose of slaughter,
or instigation to commit it, or any aid lent in the contrivance
or execution of it, this of after assistance will be a strong
ingredient to make out the charge of art and part; as it
strengthens a train of facts, which on the whole go to prove
a share taken in the enterprise, and indeed to presume a pro∣mise
of that assistance which is afterwards given, and where∣of
the expectation would substantially encourage to the at∣tempt.
And here I may cite the case of Robert Walker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1642.</NOTE> and
David and Margaret Graham, tried for the murder of Isobel
Walker, the wife of Robert. The sole actor here was David
Graham, who strangled the woman in a solitary place in the
night; being instigated thereto by the other two, who con∣trived
the occasion of the deed, by sending her on a pretend∣ed
errand in the night. Robert expressed his joy on hearing
that the deed was done. And having taken her plaid, and
wrapped it round the corpse, he, with the assistance of the o∣ther
pannels, carried it to the river, and cast it into a salmon
cruive. On these grounds, they were all found art and part of
the murder, and were condemned to die. Of this description
also was the noted case of James Stewart in Aucharn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 21. 22. 23. 25. 1752.</NOTE> for the
murder of Campbell of Glenure; where the assistance given the
murderer to escape after the deed, was joined to sundry circum∣stances
of previous aid and comfort towards the commission
of it. It is true, that this trial was attended with several very
unusual things in the manner of conducting it, and for which
it would be very difficult to find any apology; but I see no
reason to believe that the verdict was not according to the
<PB N="443" REF="502"/>
justice of the case, or different from what the jury were
warranted to return upon the evidence laid before them.</P>
<P>BUT, how sufficient soever the grounds of conviction in
these and the like cases; it is a very different sort of charge,
and seems to constitute a distinct offence from homicide,
where the after assistance is libelled by itself, unconnected
with any earlier knowledge of, or concern in the deed.
To assist in concealing the dead body; to harbour the actors,
and help them to escape; to rescue them from the officers
of justice; to bear false witness for them on their trial;
or to persuade others to do so, or to suppress their testi∣mony
against them; all these are, doubtless, immoral and
criminal acts, and from which suspicion may sometimes
arise against the persons convicted of them, of a deeper
concern in the deed. But they are no part of the hi∣story
of the slaughter; nay they do not even necessarily
infer an approbation of it; since they may be done out
of affection only or compassion for the actors, to relieve
them of the consequences of that which cannot be reme∣died
nor undone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 97.</NOTE> In the case, accordingly, of Barbara
Coutts, her assisting to conceal the corpse was found only rele∣vant
to infer an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The interlocutor uses the term of <HI>the pains of law,</HI> but is opposed to that of <HI>the pains of death▪</HI> used in the former part of the same interlocutor.</P>
<P>On the 8th of November 1555, Marieta Montgomery, Lady Semple, came in will on a charge of resetting the murderers of Gilbert Rankine, “Per ejus do∣mmae servitores commissi, per receptationem suorum ser vitorum qui crimen praedictum commiserunt, manu sanguinea, seu recenti, cadem nocte, infra cas∣trum de Laven, immediate post crimen perpetratum.” But I do not find that any sentence followed.</P></NOTE>. In the case too of Thomas
Bryce, (taken notice of by Mackenzie),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar 22. and June 1. 1039.</NOTE> being that of a father
resetting his son, who had committed murder, and deterring
a constable who pursued him red-hand, the pannel's plea
<PB N="444" REF="503"/>
seems to have had the effect of hindering the libel to be pro∣secuted
to any issue. It is true, that in his observations on the
statute 1426, c. 91. that author seems himself to have given
a different opinion of our law. But in this he has not duly
attended to the statute which he cites as his authority; for
it has relation only to the harbouring of denounced cri∣minals.
Besides, even in the times (if ever there were such),
when this enactment was observed; still the resetting of the
manslayer was not punished as an accession to the murder,
but as a special and distinct offence <HI>of resetting,</HI> created by
statute for the better execution of justice, which was then
so difficult to be enforced.</P>
<P>WHAT is true of these modes of after assistance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Accession by ratifying the Deed.</NOTE> seems
to be equally so of that still more remote concern, which
only consists in ratifying and approving the murder;
whether by speaking in praise of the deed, or more sub∣stantially,
by reward bestowed on the actor, or by com∣fort
and countenance rendered him on account of it. To
applaud, and much more to recompense so foul a crime, is
indeed a thing of too pernicious example to pass uncensured
by the law; not to mention, that suspicion may naturally be
entertained of those who thus praise and confirm the deed,
that they secretly abetted it beforehand. Yet still, by itself,
and unsupported with proof of instigation or assistance, it is
only a misdemeanour, and not a participation of the act of
slaughter; not even, which is the most unfavourable case for
the pannel, though it should appear that in his name, or on
his quarrel, the deed was done. For one man cannot impli∣cate
another in guilt, by acting on his own opinion of his wishes
and desires, if these have never been communicated to him the
actor in a palpable form, so as to be motives of his deed. And
<PB N="445" REF="504"/>
it is not a certain inference, that he who expresses satisfaction
at the doing of such a thing without his risk or participation,
would have authorised or have taken a part in the enterprise,
if proposed to him. Besides; if the inference were even cer∣tain,
the fact has not happened so; and it is not for their evil
dispositions that men are punished, but for the evil things
which they have actually done. There are indeed certain
texts of the Roman law, which have often been quoted on
the other side<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. de vi Armata, L. 1. No. 14; L. 3. No. 10.</NOTE>; but I find nothing in the books of adjour∣nal
to countenance the opinion, that our practice would
be determined by those authorities. It must, however, al∣ways
be remembered, that if the pannel not only ratify the
deed when done, but have known and countenanced, or have
instigated to it, beforehand, this may amount to an acces∣sion;
especially if the actor be a person under the influence<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This was the description of the case of Robertsons, March 6. 9. 1671, indic∣ted for casting down of houses. The actors, tried along with him, were his own sons, pupils, resident in the house with him, from whence they set out on the en∣terprise, attended with a host of his tenants and dependents, and to which they returned after throwing down the houses. He then in very strong terms appro∣ved of what they had done, blamed them for not doing more, and continued to reset and entertain them. These circumstances, related in the libel, were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be a relevant ground of charge. As they might also be in a case of mur∣der.</NOTE>
of the approver, such as a son, a servant, or the like.</P>
<P>ON the whole of our inquiry concerning these several ways
of accession, by instigation, order, ratihabition, or assist∣ance
after the fact, the result seems rather to be, that though
cases cannot be supposed often to happen, so strongly circum∣stanced
with respect to any one of these grounds of charge,
<PB N="446" REF="505"/>
as to make it relevant of itself, yet, taken jointly, they may
amount to a just ground of conviction.</P>
<P>LET us now add a few words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Trial of Accession to Murder.</NOTE> concerning the mode and
form of process against an accessary to this crime. In this
article, the courts of England seem to be embarrassed with
a number of subtile, and (as they appear to us) unsubstantial
distinctions, to which our practice is a stranger. With us,
the principal actor and the accessary, in whatever way he
is so, may be called in one libel, and put to the bar toge∣ther<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was found on full consideration, in a case of indictment for casting down of houses; the case of Robertsons in March 1671; where the principal actors were two boys, the sons of the instigator and ratifier. The rule seems to be equally applicable to a charge of murder David Hay and John Thomson for administering and furnishing poison, were accordingly tried and convicted on one libel in the same diet. March 16. 17. 1692.</NOTE>. Or if the actor has sled, the accessary may be tried
on that same libel, after sentence of fugitation passed on it
against the actor; for the prosecutor has nothing farther in
his power. This was done in the case of Robert and Gil∣bert
Kennedy, in July 1706; and of Stewart of Aucharn,
in September 1752. Nay, the trial may even proceed with∣out
that sort of sentence against the actor, which is only a
sentence for contempt, and does not take place on the notion
of the outlaw's guilt of the charge, or if it did, still could be
no manner of presumption against his associate, who can
only be convicted on full proof of the <HI>corpus delicti,</HI> and
of his own concern in the slaughter, in like manner as if no
fugitation had passed. This point seems to have been final∣ly
settled in the case of James Edmonston.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 29. and July 29. 1695.</NOTE> Being brought to
trial, alone, on a libel which stated the murder as the act of
another, and him as instigator only and assistant, he pleaded,
<PB N="447" REF="506"/>
that the trial could not proceed until the actors were con∣victed,
or at least discussed by sentence of fugitation. This
dilatory objection was repelled, and the trial went on. The
same judgment had been given long ago, in the case of Muir
of Auchindrayne, in July 1611, who objected that Kennedy,
the actor, had not been discussed. Indeed, every objection
of this sort is in a great measure excluded by the very form
of our criminal libel, in which the pannel is always charg∣ed
in both characters, of actor or art and part; whereby the
case is laid open to a conviction of either sort of guilt, as
the fact may turn out to be. It is also certain, that un∣der
this form of charge, the prosecutor is admitted to a
proof of all circumstances, prior, concomitant, or after the
fact, from which the accession may be inferred.</P>
<P>X. THE pains of law for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punishment of Murder.</NOTE> are the pains of
death, and confiscation of moveables. In atrocious cases,
it had been usual for the Judge to award some farther
suffering or indignity, the better to mark the public de∣testation
of the crime; such as striking off the hand be∣fore
execution; the hanging of the dead body in chains;
the quartering of the body, and affixing of the head and
limbs on conspicuous places, to keep up the memory and
terror of the example. And by a late statute, the 25th
George II. ch. 37. entitled, <HI>for better preventing the horrid
crime of murder,</HI> it is ordered, that the sentence shall be
for delivery of the body to surgeons, to be dissected,
(unless ordered to be hung in chains); and that in no
case shall the body be buried, until it be dissected. It
farther appoints, that during the period between sentence
and execution, the convict shall be confined apart from all
other prisoners, and without access of any person to him,
<PB N="448" REF="507"/>
unless by permission of the Sheriff, or of the Court where he
was convicted; as also, that he shall be fed (excepting in
case of violent illness), with bread and water only.</P>
<P>WHERE it happens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assythment in what Cases due.</NOTE> that the pannel is only convicted of
culpable homicide, or that sentence is prevented by an act
of indemnity, or that he escapes execution of the capital
sentence through interposition of the royal mercy; as also,
according to one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 99.</NOTE> but a doubtful decision, where he is out∣lawed
for non-appearance; in all these situations, one other
consequence is, that he becomes liable in a sum of money,
or <HI>assythment,</HI> as it is called, to the widow and children, or
other the next of kin of the deceased. This exaction, whe∣ther
it is properly to be viewed as <HI>damages</HI> decreed to those
persons in satisfaction of the injury which they sustain by
the loss of their relation, or, (which is the opinion of Lord
Kames<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Law Tracts, vol. ii. art. 1. at the end.</NOTE>, and in itself seems not improbable), as the remains
of a more barbarous state of things, before the full establish∣ment
of public justice, when the criminal redeemed his
blood, and pacified the resentment of the kindred, by pay∣ment
of a stated composition<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See this matter argued, Maclaurin, No. 98.</NOTE>; has at all times been part of
our custom. And this so firmly, that even the Sovereign ne∣ver
pretended to have any power of protecting the criminal
against it; so far from it, that by the ordinary style of all
remissions, they bore a clause obliging to assyth the party<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Act 1424, c. 46.</NOTE>.
And indeed, such was the strictness observed of old in this
matter, that we find the Court ordering a person to be kept
<PB N="449" REF="508"/>
in sure ward during the space of forty days, thereby allowed
him to find caution for the assythment, and in case of his
failure so to do within that time, “to be justifyit and
execute to the deid for the saids crimes, notwithstanding
his remissione, conform to the law.” This was in the
case of Peter Dunne, April 19. 1554<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And because the said Peter Dunne could get nae sufficient soverties to find for him for assythement of parties of the gudes and skaiths above specified, the Justices therefore decernit him to be keepit in sure ward within the said tolbooth of Edinburgh, while the said sovertie were fundin by him, swa that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind the samen within forty days next hereafter; and failzing of finding thereof the saids fortie days being by past, doome was given upon him to be justifyit and execute to the deid for the saids crimes, notwithstanding his re∣missione conform to the law.”</NOTE>. Farther still; it was
by more than one statute provided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593, c. 173. 178.; 1581, c. 136.; 1592, c. 157.</NOTE> that no remission should
have effect, nor be allowed in Court, unless it proceeded (and
bore <HI>in gremio</HI> so to be), on evidence of satisfaction already
made to the kindred, and on the sight of sufficient <HI>litterae
pacis,</HI> or <HI>letters of slains,</HI> obtained from them. These were
letters, signed by the four principal branches of the kindred
of the deceased<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Balsour's Practicks, p. 517.</NOTE>, or the greater part of them, bearing re∣ceipt
of the assythment, granting oblivion of the injury, dis∣charging
the offender of all action, civil or criminal, at their
instance, on that account, and requesting the King to grant
him a remission. But though this in strictness was the law;
in practice it had long ago been thus far relaxed, that a re∣mission
might pass in Exchequer without production of the
letters of slains, on surety found there to the satisfaction
of the Court, for payment of such a sum as should afterwards
be awarded.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="509"/>
IN this course of proceeding, the care of taxing and decree∣ing
for the assythment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Court competent to tax Assyth∣ment.</NOTE> as an appendage of the pardon, natu∣rally
fell to the Judges of Exchequer. But of late years, the
ordinary course of expeding remissions has been, that they go
from the Secretary of State's office to the seals <HI>per saltum,</HI>
without passing through Exchequer at all. And in con∣sequence,
the practice has been introduced of allowing a re∣mission
in the Court of Justiciary, on surety found, (and
sometimes on enactment of the party himself<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was allowed at passing the remission in the case of Piccars and Collins, 22d April 1728; they being strangers and soldiers, and unable to find surety. As also in the case of Joseph Hume, 22d December 1732.</NOTE>), to pay such
assythment as shall afterwards be modified in the proper
Court. Commonly, the care of fixing the sum, and seeing
the caution duly found, has been remitted by the criminal
Court to the Barons of Exchequer; owing probably to their
ancient connection with this sort of business. This was
done in the case of Macneil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1717.</NOTE> (who appears to have lain in
goal until evidence was produced to the Court, of his pay∣ment
of the sum taxed in Exchequer); in the case of Ma∣thews,
November 13. 1721; of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Stobs,
July 30. 1727; of Joseph Hume, December 22. 1732; and
of David Hume,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1740.</NOTE> March 27. 1733. But on occasion of
Sir James Stewart's remission, for the slaughter of Moody of
Melsetter, the remit was to the Court of Session; where
process was accordingly raised by the son of the deceased,
in June 1741. The same course was taken at allowing the
remission in favour of Thomas Roy, June 24. 1760. And in∣deed
it seems probable, that on pleading of pardon in the Court
of Justiciary, they are as competent to tax the assythment
themselves, as to delegate this office to any other judicature.
<PB N="451" REF="510"/>
In the above cases of Sir Gilbert Elliot<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Declaring always, That it should be but prejudice of this Court to modi∣fy and determine such sum or sums in name of assythment as they should think fit, in all such cases that should come before them in time coming, not∣withstanding of the above reference to the Barons of Exchequer.”</NOTE>, Joseph Hume, and
Thomas Roy, the interlocutor was accordingly guarded with
a provision, saving the right of the Court to do this duty
themselves in any future case, if they should see cause.</P>
<P>BUT be this as it may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Court can tax Assythment.</NOTE> in the case of a remission; at least
it is not disputable, that where a prosecution in the Court of
Justiciary is at instance of the kindred of the deceased, and
issues in conviction of any sort of culpable homicide, it is
there a regular and legitimate part of the sentence, to tax and
award the assythment. As was done in the case of Mason,
July 13. 1674; of James Sommerville, December 8. 1704; and
of Lieutenant Storrie in January 1785. And again, in all
cases where this interest has not been previously settled by de∣cree
of some other competent judicature; there, of their own
right, and independently of any remit, the Lords of Session
have jurisdiction in process brought for the assythment by
the next of kin, as a matter of pure pecuniary interest,
which is the proper province of that Court. This seems to
be assumed, (for I do not think it is introduced), in the enact∣ment
of the statute 1592, c. 157.; and two instances of such
a proceeding are to be found in Maclaurin's Reports, No. 98.
and 99.</P>
<P>As to the distribution of this <HI>solatium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assythment, to whom due.</NOTE>—According to the
decisions shortly mentioned in Balfour<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Practicks, p. 517.</NOTE>, the widow has
<PB N="452" REF="511"/>
right to a share along with her issue, the heir along with the
other children, and the immediate issue, to the exclusion of the
more remote descendents. It seems to have been held, that
he who first pursued for the assythment, though not the near∣est
of kin, would exclude the nearer relations; at least, if by
refusing to concur in the prosecution, they had shown a
want of the due regard to their deceased kinsman.</P>
<P>XI. ACCORDING to the order proposed in the beginning
of this Chapter, I have now to treat of the cases of AGGRA∣VATED
MURDER; those cases, where either on account of
some peculiar baseness or cruelty in the mode of the deed,
or on account of the relative situation of the parties, our cus∣tom
proceeds against the murderer with more than usual se∣verity.</P>
<P>1. I SHALL be brief upon the first example,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder un∣der Trust.</NOTE> that of mur∣der
under trust, as a matter which cannot now be the sub∣ject
of any question in a court of justice. The thing was
established by the statute 1587, ch. 51. which declares it to
be “quhair the partie slaine is under the traist, credite, assu∣rance
and power of the slayer,” and raises the crime to
the rank of treason▪; ordering the offender to “forfault life,
lands and goods.” In themselves, the words of this de∣scription
are somewhat equivocal; and what the meaning
of the Legislature was might have been subject of contro∣versy,
unless we had been informed by history<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Spottiswood's History, p. 343.</NOTE>, of the oc∣casion
of passing the act; namely, the murder of the Laird
of Maclean in 1586, by one of the Macdonalds who had
been in feud with him, but enticed him to his house with
special invitations, and promises of safety. The proper cases
<PB N="453" REF="512"/>
therefore, to which the statute applied, were those where the
deceased had put himself into the killer's power, as at that
particular time, under the pledge and assurance, (either ex∣press,
or implied in the nature of the situation), of hospitality,
safety, and protection; and in these it would more especi∣ally
hold, if there had been previous feud between the par∣ties,
to occasion the exacting of such a pledge. It was under∣stood
in this sense in the following cases, where sentence
passed for the statutory pains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1605.</NOTE> The case of William Ross of
Dunskeith<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He was also charged with the murder of his own wife.</NOTE>, who bearing deadly hatred to Gibson, enticed
him by a friendly invitation to the house of a third par∣ty,
entertained him hospitably there throughout the day,
and at length, in the evening, invited him to lodge in
his (Ross's) house; which Gibson having agreed to, Ross
and his servants murdered him in the dark, on the way.
The case of Peter Weir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1611.</NOTE> who murdered John Hamilton at an
appointment which he had made with him, under pretence
of settling certain controversies at law that were between
them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1611.</NOTE> The case of Muir of Auchindrayne, who having ap∣pointed
to meet his ancient enemy, but late ally, the Tutor
of Cassillis, at a certain place, gave notice of this to others,
and instigated them to kill him. The case of John Max∣well
of Gerrarie and his son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1619.</NOTE> for the murder of Mackay of
Glassack, a person who had for some months been residing
with them at bed and board, “swa that nae suspicione of in∣jurie
(says the record) to be done be the said John Max∣well
could be thocht of be him.” He was killed one
evening, when coming to the house of Gerrarie, in company
with Maxwell's sons.</P>
<P>IT seems to be more doubtful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder un∣der Trust. Aug. 2. 1627.</NOTE> whether the judgment was
right in the case of Andrew Rowan, and also of the said Wil∣liam
<PB N="454" REF="513"/>
Ross, which extended the statute from those cases of spe∣cial
or covenanted trust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1605.</NOTE> to that general and constant state of
confidence, in which married persons may be said to be,
with respect to each other. In the next case which happen∣ed,
that of John Jamieson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14. 1628.</NOTE> the murder of the pannel's wife
was libelled as simple murder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21. 1664.</NOTE> In that of John Swin∣ton,
it was again charged as <HI>treason;</HI> but after full debate,
in which Sir George Mackenzie pleaded for the pannel, the
libel was restricted to a charge of <HI>murder,</HI> aggravated by the
relation of the parties. The like restriction took place in
the trial of Margaret Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 17. 1665.</NOTE> for the murder of Robert
Bedford her husband; a case of note at the time, and which
seems to have been tried with extraordinary care. And al∣though
in the later case of Robert Downie for the murder of
his wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 16. 1677.</NOTE> the libel is laid for murder under trust, and is
found relevant in general terms, yet the sentence is for the
ordinary pains of murder.</P>
<P>INDEED, if the statute properly related to the case of
spouses, it was equally applicable to the trust between parent
and child.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. 1663.</NOTE> But Stair reports the case of Yeaman against
Oliphant, relative to the murder of a mother by her son,
where the Lords of Session found that this was not murder
under trust.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. 1688.</NOTE> And in the case of Philip Standsfield, for the
murder of his father, where the statute was libelled, the
Court found the charge only relevant to infer the pains of
death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As to the pannell's murdering his father, mentioned in the indytement, they found the libell, as it is libelled and qualified, relvant to infer the pains of death.”</NOTE>. But on these or any other difficulties which may
have arisen touching the construction of this law, it is need∣less
<PB N="455" REF="514"/>
to enlarge; since the statute of the 7th of Anne, c. 21.
has reduced this offence to its natural and proper rank, of
an aggravated murder.</P>
<P>2. THE same statute took away that Scottish treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Killing in the royal Presence.</NOTE> in∣troduced
by the act 1593, c. 177, which was committed by
killing in the Parliament House during the sitting of Parlia∣ment;
or in the King's chamber of presence, the King being
in the palace at the time; or in presence of the King where∣ever
he is; or in the King's council-house during the sitting
of the Privy Council; or within the Inner Session-house, du∣ring
the sitting of the Lords of Session for administration
of justice.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD sort of treasonable slaughter that shared
the same fate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Assassination.</NOTE> was that of <HI>assassination;</HI> which, in the case of
its being done for service rendered to the King or Church,
had been raised to the degree of treason, by the statute
1681, c. 15. which was made on occasion of the murder of
Sharpe, Archbishop of St Andrew's. In our practice this
term seems not to have been understood in its restricted and
most proper sense, of slaughter committed for hire, and in
the quarrel of another, but more generally, as of any slaugh∣ter
done “<HI>per insidias et industriam,</HI>” or by deliberate lying
in wait. It is used in that sense in the statute above cited,
as also throughout the trial of James Mitchell, (in January
1678), for his attempt on Bishop Sharpe, some years before<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The following are passages in the libel: “You did daily contrive, resolve and design, the murder and assassination of the said Archbishop.” And again, “And after you had attempted and committed the said villany and assassination <HI>tanquam insidiator et per industriam,</HI> and by way of forethought felony, you did go away and escape,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The term is used in the same sense in the trial of John Maciver and Alexander Mowat, 15th December 1686, for the murder of Maciver's master, for whom they lay in wait in the wood of Humby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="515"/>
4. ANOTHER sort of murder, which, according to Mac∣kenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">B. 1. tit. 8.</NOTE>, had been made treason by the statutes 1450,
c. 31. and 32.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poison.</NOTE> is murder committed by means of poison.
And certainly, in every point of view, it justly holds the
rank of a dangerous and aggravated murder; whether it be
considered with respect to the deliberate and continued ma∣lice
which is shown in the contrivance of it; or the cruelty
of such a way of compassing death, which (as Mackenzie
observes) is such, that the law will not employ it even
against a criminal; or the impossibility of guarding against
such attempts, which those persons have the easiest and most
frequent opportunities of making, who are in situations of
confidence and trust. Nevertheless, it will be difficult to find
a warrant for applying the pains of treason to this crime,
in either of the above mentioned statutes; whereof both
the words and the rubric, (whatever might be the intention
of the Legislature), are strictly limited to the homebringers
of poison, and have no relation to the users. And thus we
are at no loss to account for that which Mackenzie himself,
both in his Treatise of Crimes and his observations on these
statutes, has remarked, (though he wonders how it should be
so); that he had found no instance in the records, of the
pains of treason inflicted on the giver of poison. Yet not a few
atrocious cases had happened, to which probably the Judges
applied the utmost severity, that was held to be within
their power. I shall mention one of the most remarkable.
On the 1st of December 1613, Robert Erskine, and his
sisters, Helen, Isobel, and Anne Erskine, were convicted of
conspiring to destroy two youths, his nephews, sons of the
<PB N="457" REF="516"/>
Laird of Dun, his brother, by sorcery and poison, in order
to get possession of the family-estate. The libel relates, that
for this purpose they went and consulted with Janet Irving, a
notorious witch, how they might best destroy the children;
and that she furnished them with certain herbs, to compose a
<HI>draught;</HI> of which the eldest boy having drank, was seized with
violent vomiting, and died “in great pain and dolour”, utter∣ing
these or the like words upon his deathbed, “Wo is me that
I ever had right of successione to ony landis or living, for
gif I had been borne some puir cotteris sone, I had nocht
been sa demanit, nor sic wicket practicks had bene plottit
againis me for my landis.” The other boy recovered.
These pannels were convicted, and had sentence to be be∣headed;
which was executed on all but Helen, who was al∣lowed
to go into banishment. There is no mention of for∣feiture
in the sentence. Neither is it any part of the doom
on John Dick and Janet Alexander his spouse, who were
convicted in March 1649, of the murder of his brother and
sister, having poisoned them with arsenick, which was admi∣nistered
in a loaf or <HI>bannock.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is needless to enter farther into this discussion now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poison.</NOTE>
after the statute of Anne, which has lowered this sort of mur∣der
from the rank of treason, if ever it stood in that degree.
The following are some of the most noted trials for it in later
times.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1754.</NOTE> Nicolas Cockburn was convicted of the murder
of her husband and his mother; a crime to which the main
incentive seems to have been, to disappoint a beneficial settle∣ment
in favour of the mother as a widow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. &amp; 12. 1755.</NOTE> Andrew Wilson was
convicted of poisoning his spouse; for the purpose, it appears,
of marrying a younger wife. In August 1765, Patrick
Ogilvy and Catharine Nairne were convicted of the crimes
<PB N="458" REF="517"/>
of incest and poisoning her husband, who was Ogilvy's bro∣ther.
The catalogue may properly be closed with the no less
atrocious case of Mathew Hay, convicted at Ayr, in May
1780, of poisoning and attempting to poison a whole family;
one of whom, the person chiefly meant to be destroyed, was
pregnant by him at the time. She, her sister, and her sister-in-law
survived, though grievously injured in their health;
but her father and mother died.</P>
<P>To bring a case under the description of murder by poi∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poison.</NOTE>
it is not indispensable that the stuff or substance admi∣nistered
be of that kind, which is ordinarily known and di∣stinguished
as a poison; if the circumstances of the case yield
pregnant evidence, on the whole, of the pannel's intention
to destroy by means of it. Which may not only appear
from the known quality and common operation of the
thing, (as where arsenick is given or verdigrise); but also
from the excessive quantity, or the frequent repetition of the
dose, being of a substance such as hemloc, tartar emetic, and
many others, which are used as medicines: and may also
appear from the age or the condition of the person to whom
the composition is applied; as if a few drops of laudanum
are given to a new-born infant, or if a person, for some
slight complaint, is made to take large and repeated doses
of the very medicine, the most suited to increase and aggra∣vate
it into a mortal illness. How unlikely soever such a thing,
it did once happen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 16. and Feb. 8. 1676.</NOTE> I refer to the case of George Clerk,
John Ramsay, and William Kennedy, to which Mackenzie
alludes, but without giving a full account of it. Clerk and
Ramsay were servants to John Anderson, merchant in Edin∣burgh;
Kennedy was an apothecary's apprentice; and these
three had conspired to rifle Anderson's house, and to kill
him by poison, for their greater security of the spoil. The
<PB N="459" REF="518"/>
season happened to be sickly, and a flux was prevailing in the
town. And this opportunity they took advantage of, to
administer such medicines to him in his drink and victuals, as
might bring that complaint on him; which accordingly in a
short time ensued. They next gave him a potion, to lay him
asleep; and while he was in that state, they broke into his repo∣sitories,
and plundered him of money, jewels, and other effects,
to a considerable amount. Contrary, however, to their ex∣pectation,
the disease appeared to abate, and the man to be
in a way of recovery; which made it necessary for them
to administer still more violent purgatives, such as might
instantly waste and destroy him. One dose appears to have
been given on a Saturday morning, another on the evening
of the succeeding Sunday, and early on the morning of Mon∣day
he was dead. A libel laid for theft and murder upon
these grounds, was found relevant against Clerk and Ramsay.
The jury found them “guilty of the theft, and also guilty
of designing” (that is conspiring), “to dispatch John An∣derson
the defunct, and giving him powders and jallops to
that effect.” They were condemned and executed ac∣cordingly.
With respect to Kennedy, who furnished the me∣dicines
and received part of the plunder, a debate ensued on
the relevancy of the libel; and in the end, after he had lain
twenty months in goal, the Court saw cause to banish him
on his own petition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1677.</NOTE> without pronouncing any interlocutor
on the charge.</P>
<P>5. THE crime of parricide also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Parricide.</NOTE> is one of those which find
a fit place in the list of aggravated murders; being such, of
which the laws of all countries have agreed in testifying their
abhorrence, by denouncing some extraordinary punishment for
the person, who shall be convicted of so wicked and unnatu∣ral
<PB N="460" REF="519"/>
a deed. What our Legislature has fixed on for that pur∣pose,
is a total corruption, (contrary to our ordinary custom), of
the convict's blood; so as that all his posterity may “be dis∣herised
in all time hereafter, fra their lands, heritages, tacks,
possessions;” which are to devolve on the next collateral
relations, in the same manner as if the direct line had failed.
This is ordered by the statute 1594, ch. 224. with respect to
him, “that has slaine, or shall hereafter slay his father or
mother, gudesir or gudedame.” Mackenzie has given his
opinion, that these terms are not to be extended to the kill∣ing
of a father or mother by affinity. And indeed, be∣side
the reasons which Mackenzie has given, there is this
other, that in themselves the relations by alliance are not in
the same degree of awe, reverence, and sanctity as the natu∣ral;
on which account, in the construction of the statute
against beating of parents, which uses the same terms of
<HI>father and mother,</HI> it has been found<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Case of Brown and Chalmers, July 18. 1735.</NOTE> that they do not
include father nor mother-in-law. The same author has
said<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Parricide, No. 3.</NOTE>, that though not <HI>in terminis</HI> so expressed, the sta∣tute
may however reach the case of the parent killing
the child. But, beside the general rule against extending
any penal law by implication, there seems reason to doubt
this from the very nature of the statutory pains, which
are not suitable to that situation, and would be attended
with the absurdity of disinheriting the grand-child, in the
case of the murder of its father by the grand-father. Nei∣ther
has this opinion that support from the authority of the
Roman law, which Mackenzie has supposed. For though the
slaughter of a child, and also of some other relations, was
<PB N="461" REF="520"/>
known by the name of parricide in the Roman system; yet
the peculiar pains of parricide, by drowning the convict
sewed up in the same bag with a dog, a viper, and an ape,
were confined to the case of proper parricide by the murder
of father, mother, or other relation in the direct line of as∣cendants<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. ad L. Pomp. L. 9. No. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do they reach natural Chil∣dren.</NOTE> Mackenzie inclines to the severe con∣struction
in the case also of natural children; because, (says
he), this is a crime against nature. But what he alleges on the
other side seems to be the better reason; that they ought not
to be subject to the disadvantages of a state, whereof they
do not enjoy the benefits. And if this be a sound plea, it
applies equally to the case of the slaughter of either parent;
since, how certain soever the natural connection with the
mother, the bastard child does not inherit of her, nor of
any person through her. It is always to be remembered,
that the question is not about the personal punishment of the
murderer, but about a patrimonial consequence to his issue,
and this only introduced by a positive ordinance, which in
using the terms <HI>father and mother,</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itly be understood
to mean only those relations, which are acknowledged by the
law in other questions.</P>
<P>I HAVE found but four convictions of this monstrous crime
in the record.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Parricide.</NOTE> That of John Dickson, eldest son of Dick∣son
of Belchester, April 30. 1591, who had sentence to be
broken on a <HI>row</HI> or wheel; that of Philip Standsfield, Fe∣bruary
6. 1688, for the murder of his father Sir Philip Stands∣field
of Newmills; that of William Rutherford, Septem∣ber
7. 1694; and that of James Lauder, February 14. March 7.
1707. The two last persons had sentence to have the right
<PB N="462" REF="521"/>
hand struck off, before execution. For what reason I know
not, the statute was not libelled in any of these instances.
One of the circumstances stated in the libel, and given in
evidence, in the case of Standsfield, as a presumption of his
guilt, was that the dead body of his father bled afresh when
the pannel touched it. He was, however, convicted on very
strong presumptions.</P>
<P>6. IT yet remains to take notice of another sort of mur∣der,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Child Mur∣der.</NOTE> which also passes under the name of parricide, (in a loose
sense), and is of all murders the most frequent; the murder
of a child by its own parent. This too, more commonly
happens by the hand of that one of the parents, who by
nature stands most attached to the child; but whose affec∣tions,
in the case of an unlawful intercourse, have to strug∣gle
with the also natural and strong emotions of shame,
the fear of relations, and too often the dread of want,
and the bitterness of treachery and desertion: A struggle
the more difficult to be sustained, as me has to bear it
in secret, and for a length of time, and without any aid of
counsel, or of comfort, to support her. Besides; this sort of
slaughter is the more likely to be frequent, that it is not
like others, which excite immediate inquiry by the sudden
disappearance of a known person, and are proclaimed by the
plain marks of violence upon the body, as soon as it is found;
but on the contrary, by steady denial of the pregnancy, and
a secret delivery, and concealment of the dead body, may be
placed beyond the reach, (in a great measure), of ordinary le∣gal
evidence to detect it. Add to this; that even wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the
body is discovered, there is yet so great a difficulty of ascer∣taining
whether there has been life in it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See on this subject, an able paper of the late Dr William Hunter's, publish∣ed in <HI>Medical Observations by a Society of Physicians in London,</HI> vol. vi. art. 26.</NOTE>; as well as that
<PB N="463" REF="522"/>
the new and tender life may be suppressed with so little use
of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHILD MURDER.</NOTE> nay, without any violence at all, by bare ne∣glect
and want of care of the helpless infant; circumstances
which at once tempt and reconcile to the deed.</P>
<P>IT appears that this evil had been much felt in the years
1680 and 1681;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Act 1690, as to Child Murder.</NOTE> of which period there are very numerous
trials for child-murder, and these, for the greater part, of
the kind above described, in which a jury could not con∣vict,
without proceeding on such presumptions as are not
very desirable to be trusted, in a matter of life and death.
To repress, therefore, the growing frequency of the crime,
and, as far as might be, to relieve juries from so painful an
exercise of judgment, the Legislature added an enactment to
the statute-book, the act 1690, c. 21. which is framed on
the like plan that had been followed in some other coun∣tries<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See 21st Jac. I. c. 27. Edict of Henry II. of France, <HI>an.</HI> 1556.</NOTE>, and authorises, or rather obliges, a jury to convict,
on proof of certain <HI>indicia</HI> or presumptions of guilt, with∣out
direct evidence of murder. The circumstances selec∣ted
for this purpose are, that the woman have conceal∣ed
her situation during the whole period of pregnancy,
and have not called for help to her delivery, and that
the child is found dead, or is missing. Even before the
passing of this law, juries in many instances, though not
invariably, had been in the use of attending to these pre∣sumptions.
Most of the many convictions obtained in Ja∣nuary
1681, were upon no other grounds, and the same is
true respecting some others of older date; that, for instance,
<PB N="464" REF="523"/>
of Margaret Black, of the 4th August 1677<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the pannel's murdering her own child relevant, and re∣mits the same to the knowledge of an assize; as also, they remit to the assize to consider how far the probation of the presumptions and circum∣stances libelled does infer the pannel guilty of the said crime of murder.”</NOTE>; that of Mar∣garet
and Agnes Taylor of the 24th June 1663; and of Bessie
Brebner of the 17th July 1663. Also, in June 1614, Janet
Brown was convicted of child-murder, in regard she went out
to the fields, and so neglected the ordinary help for being
delivered. Nay more; even in cases where the jury, not
choosing to proceed on such grounds, had acquitted the pan∣nel
of the murder; still the Court in those days, were in
the use of considering the presumptions of concealment and
failure to call for help, and of inflicting some correction,
and sometimes a severe one, for this blameable course of con∣duct.
In this situation, Margaret Ramsay had sentence to
be scourged, and to be banished from the city of Edinburgh,
March 6. 1662. And on the 20th August 1662, (but with
this difference, that the jury expressly remitted the presump∣tions
for the consideration of the Court), Marion Lawson was
sentenced to be scourged, and to be banished from the she∣riffdom
of Mid Lothian.</P>
<P>LET us now attend more particularly to the circumstances
which the statute has required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Child must be amissing.</NOTE> to place a jury in this, (as
it must be admitted to be), distressing situation. It is the
fundamental circumstance, that the woman be proved to
have been pregnant, and that the child be missing, or that the
dead body of a child be found, which is proved to be her child.
In the former case, the proof of the pregnancy can only be by
those symptoms in the state of the woman's person, which
<PB N="465" REF="524"/>
show her to have been recently delivered, (or, as I find the
witnesses often express it, to be a <HI>green lighter woman</HI>).
The statute has presumed, that decisive evidence of the preg∣nancy
may in this way be obtained, (else it could not have
ordered any thing in the case of a child that is missing), and
that where the birth is a mere abortion, or has not been
foully dealt with, it will not be put out of the way. The
libel was accordingly sustained, (though, for a separate rea∣son,
the prosecutor only insisted for an arbitrary punish∣ment),
in the case of Catharine Smith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp; 24. 1701.</NOTE> where the child was
still missing at the time of trial, and no evidence was offered
of her having brought one forth, other than the condition of
her person. In the case of the body being found, that evi∣dence
may be strengthened, if the woman, on being shown
the body, has before witnesses admitted it to be that of her
child; which confession, of itself, has always been held
sufficient proof of that material fact against her. An argu∣ment
was maintained to the contrary, but without success,
in the case of Margaret Crooks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. Aug. 5. Dec. 2. &amp; 4. 1718.</NOTE> who was convicted, and
had doom in terms of the statute. The verdict also against
Marion Govan, December 7. 1703, on which she had sen∣tence
of death, specifies her acknowledgment of the child
as the ground of conviction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, &amp;c. That Marion Govan pannel, is guilty of contravening the said act, by concealing her being with child, and not calling for help in the time of the birth, and after notice of her being brought to bed the child was found dead, <HI>which she acknowledged to be her's</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of this Part of the Charge</NOTE> before proceeding, be proper to observe,
that this alternative of the child being found dead, or being
missing, which was perhaps necessary to be inserted in the
statute, seems in some instances to have crept also into the
<PB N="466" REF="525"/>
libel; which bears an alternative charge, that <HI>either</HI> the
child was found dead <HI>or</HI> was missing. The libel is in that
form in the case of Helen Marshall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. 1720. Nov. 14. 1720. July 24. 1721.</NOTE> of Ann Brown, and of
Janet Hutchie. Now, (though in none of these cases was
any objection stirred), the propriety of such a charge may
seem to be doubtful. This is a matter of which the prose∣cutor
never can be ignorant; and he is obliged to make his
charge definite and positive, as far as the circumstances of
the case allow him. Nor has the statute given him any
dispensation in this respect, but only put two grounds of
accusation in his power, either of which he may employ,
as the case happens to be. I have not observed that this
fashion has been followed in later times.</P>
<P>THE statute has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Conceal∣ment of Preg∣nancy.</NOTE> in the second place, required, that the
woman conceal her pregnancy during the whole space. And
touching this article a question has arisen, whether there be
need of an active and industrious concealment (if I may so
speak), on the part of the mother, as by the use of devices to
disguise the state of her person, or by positive denial of her
pregnancy to such as inquire; or if it satisfies the statute that
she fails to reveal her situation; which, as a negative, will prove
itself. The former construction was argued for in the case of
Margaret Paterson, August 18. 1712, and of Helen Marshall,
February 15. 1720: But no regard was paid to the plea on
either occasion; as indeed it seems to proceed on rather a
strained interpretation of the words. That the contrary is
the settled doctrine, farther appears from the verdict and
judgment in the case of Catharine Bell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. 21. 22. 1726.</NOTE> The jury did not find
that this woman had concealed her pregnancy, but negative∣ly,
thus, “and do not find it proven that she ever revealed
her being with child during the whole space of her being
<PB N="467" REF="526"/>
so.” Upon which verdict, the Court proceeded to give
sentence of death.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of Dis∣closure of the Pregnancy.</NOTE> we have farther to inquire concerning
the disclosure which the law means to exact of the pannel,
Of what kind and degree it must be, to save her from the
saction of the statute. One thing never was doubted; that
the law did not mean to exact of her an open proclamation
of her shame, but only such a disclosure, as in itself may be
sufficient to take off the presumption of any evil purpose
against the child on its birth. If she reveal therefore to
two or three persons, though these be even her own relations,
and though to all others she persist in denying her preg∣nancy;
this has always been held sufficient to avoid the pre∣sumption
of the law. In particular, it had that effect in
the case of Elizabeth Orrock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. &amp; 3. 1715.</NOTE> where the jury found, “That
during the said time of the said pannel Elizabeth Orrock's
being with child, she revealed the same; Jean Orrock the
pannel's sister-german being one of the witnesses<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">She swore, that no one was present when the pannel revealed to her. There was but one other witness, who swore to a different occasion, when the pannel had spoken ambiguously.</NOTE>.” In
the case, also, of Elizabeth Johnston, tried on the 7th and
8th of the same month, the jury had in this matter given
credit to the assertion of two witnesses; one of whom swore,
that she revealed to him, in the presence of some other per∣sons.
They found in general terms that she had revealed;
and thus the woman's life was saved.</P>
<P>IT is liable to more doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disclosure to one person; if sufficient.</NOTE> and has been the subject of op∣posite
judgments, whether a disclosure ought to be sustained
<PB N="468" REF="527"/>
that is made to one person, alone. On the libel against
Christian Park<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the indictment relevant to infer the pains libelled; and repel the de∣fence of her telling to one single woman, that she was with child, five weeks after she conceived herself to be with child.”</NOTE>, the Court, in their interlocutor of rele∣vancy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1695.</NOTE>
expressly repelled the defence of disclosure made to
one woman, at the distance of five weeks after the pannel
found herself with child. But another, and a later case, was
at least more humanely, and I think more soundly judged,
the other way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 28. and Mar. 3. 4. 1709.</NOTE> I mean the case of Isobel Taylor, where
the jury “find her being with child revealed to one wit∣ness,
and as for the other defences not proven;” where∣upon
she was <HI>simpliciter</HI> assoilzied. The disclosure in this
case was on the evening preceding the pannel's delivery, and
to a woman who gave her lodging in a barn, where she was
delivered, alone, in the night. The truth seems to be, that
the disclosure to one person, if this person be such who is
under no temptation to keep the secret, may fairly be consi∣dered
as a revealing to many persons more.</P>
<P>BUT what shall be said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disclosure to the Father, if suffi∣cient.</NOTE> if the one person to whom the
pregnancy is disclosed, is the father of the child? On the
one side; the statute has not distinguished, but has spoken
of revealing in general terms. On the other; it seems diffi∣cult
to understand the law as having regard to any but that
sort of disclosure, which indicates the mother's purpose to
take care of her child, and puts it in some probability of
being saved. Now this can hardly be said of a disclosure to
the father alone, who may often be little disposed to inte∣rest
himself in the matter, and whose treatment of the mo∣ther
it sometimes is, that urges her to the crime. This point
<PB N="469" REF="528"/>
cannot be said to have yet received a decision. It is
true, that in the case of Marion Burnet, the Court sustained
“the defence proponed by the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1709.</NOTE> that she revealed her
being with child to the father during the time thereof;
<HI>and</HI> that the child was not come to the full time when
born.” But these defences are sustained jointly; and the
last seems to be relevant, of itself. In the later case of Marga∣ret
Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 22. 1743.</NOTE> the father swore positively that she revealed to
him, but desired him to keep the matter to himself. The
jury, notwithstanding, found her guilty; and she was con∣demned
to die. But in this way, (for any thing that ap∣pears
on the record), the point was never judged of by the
Court.</P>
<P>IN whichever way this question may afterwards be de∣cided,
(if unfortunately it shall again be tried), it will be
difficult to follow one invariable rule, (though the statute
has made no distinction,—but neither was it necessary),
with regard to all disclosure, to whomsoever made, or with
whatsoever views. For what if the mother disclose her
pregnancy to some one, and at the same time her resolution
to destroy the child when born, and endeavour to seduce
this confidant to approve and assist in the purpose? Instead
of invalidating, such a disclosure strengthens the presump∣tion
against the mother. Is it nevertheless to be held, that the
case is thereby taken from under the operation of the statute?
Or again; is it to be held sufficient, though she only reveal it
to an idiot, or to one of such tender years, as cannot be sup∣posed
to make any use of the information?</P>
<P>THIS question also had been started respecting the article of
disclosure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Disclo∣sure be volun∣tary.</NOTE> whether it must be voluntary, or will be equal∣ly
available though occasioned by constraint; as for in∣stance,
<PB N="470" REF="529"/>
on examination before a Justice of the Peace, or a
kirk-session. There was a debate, but no decision by the
Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1734.</NOTE> on this matter, in the case of Jean Cowan, who proved
that the kirk-session, entertaining suspicions of her situation,
sent a midwife to her, to whom, though with some diffi∣culty,
she was prevailed on to confess; and that she af∣terwards
renewed her confession to the kirk-session them∣selves.
The jury found a verdict in her favour. And it
should seem, rightly: because all such confessions are truly
voluntary; as well as the situation of the woman is the same,
and her temptation to destroy the child is equally at an
end, by the divulging of her shame, whether it happen in
the one way or the other. For the same reason, and as the
statute has not distinguished, it seems not to make an abso∣lute
difference in law, at what period of the pregnancy the
disclosure be, whether in the beginning or towards the
close; though the nearer it is to the period of delivery,
the stronger is the presumption in her favour.</P>
<P>ANOTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Disclo∣sure be positive. Mar. 12. &amp; 23. 1713.</NOTE> and a more delicate question, occurred in the
trial of Margaret Anderson: it relates to the degree of cer∣tainty
with which the pannel must express herself in regard
to her situation. One witness swore, “That in the begin∣ning
of May last the deponent asked Margaret Anderson,
if she was with child, and she said <HI>she thought she was with
child:</HI> That there was nobody present, and from that
time till the child was born, she never did any more ac∣quaint
the deponent therewith.” Another witness swore,
“That having suspicion that the pannel was with child, she
did about the middle of the month of May last inquire
at the pannel whether she was with child or not, who
made answer, <HI>That she did not know perfectly whether she was
<PB N="471" REF="530"/>
with child or not, but that she thought herself to be with child.</HI>”
The jury, by a plurality of voices, “found the libel proven,
in so far as she brought forth a child without calling for
help in the time of the birth. And found, that the two
witnesses in the exculpation are not concurring, in so far
as the pannel's declaration anent her being with child
was not positive to them.” She was in consequence
condemned to die. But I think her case was rigorously
judged, not only by the jury, but the Court also. For this
verdict, which is of the nature of a special verdict, cannot be
said to bear an explicit finding, either way, on the article of
concealment, which is however a necessary circumstance of
the statutory crime; beside that the verdict does not say, ei∣ther
that the child was missing or was found dead.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment must be till the death of the Child.</NOTE> (though of this not many illustrations can
be supposed to happen in practice), it seems to be a necessa∣ry
quality of the concealment, that it continue down to the
death of the child. For though the mother deny her preg∣nancy
during the whole space, and be delivered without help;
yet if she relent, and do not at that time destroy the child,
but preserve, acknowledge, and show it as her's; happen to it
afterwards what may, the investigation of the alleged murder
is in this case matter of common law, and in nowise subject to
the statutory rule. For according to the whole context of the
statute, and especially by the words <HI>found dead or amissing,</HI> it
is plainly intended for the one case of murder done on an in∣fant
unknown, and in the view of concealing that any such
has ever existed. Whereas, in the case now put, the mo∣ther's
shame is published, and more effectually than it would
have been by any declaration before the birth; her child is
known to have been born alive; is neither found dead, nor is
<PB N="472" REF="531"/>
missing <HI>on the birth;</HI> and cannot afterwards disappear without
occasioning suspicion and inquiry, as in the case of any other
existing person. A situation not very remote from this was
once the subject of trial. Christian Oliphant, being with
child, had confessed the fact to the family in which she li∣ved.
She brought it forth, however, in the fields, by the
river Tyne, secretly and unassisted, and travelled away with
it to some considerable distance. A man saw her with it,
alive, immediately after the birth; and at the place where
she slept that night, and remained next day, it was seen,
alive, by the people of the house. Early, however, next
morning, she went off from her place of lodging without
warning; and the body of the child was soon after found in
a coal sink. The indictment against this woman was laid
upon the statute; but was restricted, at calling, to an arbi∣trary
punishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 3. 1701.</NOTE> “In respect the pannel was found with
the child alive.” She emitted a qualified confession; was
convicted in terms of it; and had sentence to be scourged
and set upon the pillory.</P>
<P>IN regard to the effect of disclosure proved on the part of
the pannel;—this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disclosure of Pregnancy; its effect.</NOTE> at one period, was only to save her life,
leaving her liable to some inferior correction. The reason
was, that by the supposition of the case, she still had wilful∣ly
and wrongfully neglected to make the requisite provi∣sion
for her condition, or to use assistance in the delivery;
and in this had shown a criminal indifference about the fate
of her child; exposing it to the plain risk of being de∣stroyed
in the birth. By the ordinary style, therefore, of in∣terlocutor,
as used for many years, it bore a clause in these
or the like words, subjoined to the finding of a relevancy
on the statutory charge. “And for restricting the foresaid
<PB N="473" REF="532"/>
relevancy to an arbitrary punishment, sustain the defence,
that the pannel, while she was with child, did reveal
that she was so.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 29. 1701.</NOTE> In one instance, that of Janet Riddell,
the thing is done in a form which makes the reason more pal∣pable.
“And <HI>separatim,</HI> that part of the libel, <HI>viz.</HI> that in
the time of the birth the pannel called not for help, (find
it) relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and sustain
the defence proponed for the pannel, that she revealed her
being with child, relevant to elide the capital punishment.”
The instances are also numerous of arbitrary punishment,
and often a very severe one, inflicted on a pannel, upon ver∣dict
returned to that effect in her favour. Margaret Pater∣son,
in these circumstances, was transported, November 24.
1712. Christian Strachan had the same sentence on the
same day. Elizabeth Johnston was adjudged to be twice
scourged, March 8. 1715. Elizabeth Orrock had the same
sentence on the 7th of the same month. Isobel Stirling was
adjudged to be scourged, and to be confined in the house of
correction for six months, November 21. 1726. Many in∣stances
more might easily be produced.</P>
<P>BUT though it be substantially just,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disclosure of Pregnancy, its Effects.</NOTE> that one who has been
guilty of this misdemeanour, should not be dismissed with∣out
some censure; yet with respect to the matter of form,
it may seem more questionable, whether it be a correct or
regular course, thus to restrict a libel laid upon the act 1690.
Such a libel is a charge of the crime of murder only; and
the terms of that enactment are, as it were, an interlocutor
of relevancy on the presumptions of guilt related in the
libel. If they be all proved, then must the jury find the
pannel guilty of this constructive murder; and if any one
be wanting, as plain it seems to be, that a verdict of <HI>not guilty,</HI>
<PB N="474" REF="533"/>
or <HI>not proved,</HI> ought to be returned. If, instead of this, the
jury return a special verdict, finding some of these presump∣tions
proved, and some of them not, no judgment can regu∣larly
pass upon it, but to assoilzie; because the charge has no
relation to any inferior offence, but to the crime of murder
only, and to the statutory mode of proof, which is an in∣stituted
matter, and distinct from every other. The find∣ing
of previous relevancies for arbitrary punishment on the
several presumptions separately, and in the view of verdict
being returned in these partial terms, seems, therefore, to
have been somewhat a loose and inaccurate practice. To
authorise an interlocutor of that sort, the libel, both in the
<HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> proposition, ought to bear a distinct charge
of the failure to call for assistance in the birth as a separate
offence, and liable to its proper penalty.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, it is now some time since this form of in∣terlocutor
was discontinued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. 1734.</NOTE> In the case of Jean Cowan, the
revealing, equally as the calling for help, was found relevant
entirely to <HI>elide</HI> the charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">But for <HI>eliding</HI> this last relevancy, (<HI>i. e.</HI> on the statute), sustain the defence, that the pannel did reveal her being with child, <HI>or</HI> did call for help in the birth.</NOTE>. This judgment was repeated in
the case of Margaret Stuart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 22. 1743.</NOTE> where the form of the inter∣locutor
is said to have undergone a thorough discussion, in
the view of fixing a rule for the future<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“<HI>Separatim,</HI> find the pannel her having, time and place libelled, brought forth a child▪ which was thereafter amissing or found dead; <HI>and</HI> that the pannel during the whole time of her pregnancy, did conceal her being with child, <HI>and</HI> did not call for help or assistance at the time of the birth, relevant to infer the pains of law; and for <HI>eliding</HI> this last mentioned article of the judgment, sustain the defence, that the pannel, during her pregnancy, did reveal her be∣ing with child.”</NOTE>. The style of
<PB N="475" REF="534"/>
words devised on that occasion, was precisely followed in the
case of Anne Morison. And I have not observed that in any
later case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4. 1758. and Jan. 10. 1759.</NOTE> either any punishment is inflicted, or a relevancy
to that purpose is found, on any of the many libels of this
sort which have been in Court.</P>
<P>THE statute requires one thing more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call Help to the Birth.</NOTE> to make out the pro∣secutor's
case; that the pannel have not called for, and
made use of, help and assistance in the birth. For if the
contrary be the case; if she reveal her pregnancy at this
critical period, when it would most concern her to conceal
it, if she had any evil purpose; she has therein furnished
reasonable evidence, that her previous silence was owing to
shame or other excusable motive, and not to any resolution
against the child, which in the end she does all that in her
lies to preserve: At least, it is evidence that if ever she har∣boured
any such wicked purpose, she repented before it
was too late. Besides; in this way, evidence is provided
of the actual condition of the child at the birth, whether
it be dead or alive.</P>
<P>THE chief question which arises on this clause of the statute
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call for Help to the Birth.</NOTE> whether, to <HI>elide</HI> the charge, the pannel has to prove that
she both called for and made use of help in the birth? or if
it be sufficient that she send for help, although in the end she
do not make use of it? This seems to be a question upon
the case; and which cannot be decided by any one inva∣riable
rule. In general it is obvious, that the statute means to
require such a course of conduct on the part of the mother,
as defeats the presumption against her from the concealment
of her pregnancy, and bears earnest of a fair intention to∣wards
the child, at the time of her labour. Put the case there∣fore,
<PB N="446" REF="535"/>
that having fallen in labour, the pannel discloses her
pregnancy, till then carefully concealed, to the only person
who is in the house with her at the time, and dispatches
her to some distance for a midwife. When they arrive,
the child is missing; and the mother refuses to say what
has become of it. Certainly this case is under the statute. For
though she has called for assistance to the birth, and has there∣by
revealed her pregnancy, it is in such a way as bears evi∣dence
of her hostile disposition to the child, and shows that
her whole conduct was no other than a contrivance to
get rid of this troublesome witness, the more easily to de∣stroy
it. Or again; if, on their arrival, the messenger and
midwife find the door of the house shut against them, so that
after much delay they are obliged to force entrance;
and if they find the body of the child concealed within the
house, though not bearing marks of violence; here too the
real motive of the pretended call for assistance is sufficient∣ly
explained, to deprive the pannel of all benefit from this de∣fence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Elizabeth Johnston, being with child, went to the house of Isobel Craw∣ford, to whom she revealed her condition. When near her time, she set out along with Crawford, on the road for England, meaning to bear the child there; but was taken ill by the way, and was delivered in the fields, with the assistance of Crawford, who dressed the child, and carried it back to, or at least upon the way to her own house; but soon after, exposed it in the fields, where it was found deed. Libel was laid against these women, both on the act 1690, and at common law. Afterwards, the prosecutor restricted the libel to an arbitrary pain. In these terms, it was found relevant; and the women, being convicted, were condemned to be whipped and banished, November 9. 1702. It seems very doubtful, whether the act applies to such a case at all; for it does not appear that the mother revealed, and took assistance, <HI>at first,</HI> for her own sake only, and with a view to destroy the child upon the birth. If that had been the shape of the case, it would have been attended with more difficulty.</NOTE>.
The case would not be more favourable to her, if on
coming to the house they should find the door open, and the
<PB N="477" REF="536"/>
woman abroad, and upon search should discover her in the
fields, and the dead body in her possession, or hidden there
in some secret place.</P>
<P>IF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call for Help to the Birth.</NOTE> on the contrary, they get ready entrance of the house,
and find the body of the child openly exposed in the same
apartment with the mother, who says that it was still-born, or
that it perished in the birth for want of help, the case seems as
clearly not to be within the statute. She has shewn her dis∣position
to save the child at this critical time, how blameable
soever before; and the body is here patent to immediate in∣spection,
whereby it may be judged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. &amp; 12. 1700.</NOTE> whether her story be
true or false. The case of Agnes Scott was nearly of this
description. She pleaded, that her pains came on her sud∣denly,
about a month before the full time, owing to excess
of work as a reaper in the fields; and that she sent a girl of
seven or eight years of age, the only person who was in the
house with her at the time, for a midwife. Meanwhile, she
was delivered, as she said, of a dead and immature child,
which she showed to the midwife on her coming. In these
circumstances, the Lord Advocate consented to her banish∣ment;
which was a course of lenity not so common at that
time as it has since become.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. &amp; 14. 1726.</NOTE> A defence of the same sort was
stated for Elizabeth Stirling. She related, that being seized
with her pains, she requested help of certain persons, who
accordingly came to attend her; but that these persons ha∣ving
left her, in the opinion that her time was not yet come,
she was afterwards, in their absence, suddenly taken ill, and
was delivered of a dead child. The Court found it relevant,
in general terms, that she called for help in the birth. But
the verdict on this point was against her<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">One of the most singular cases in the record, is that of Jean Riddell, March 3. 1704. Being suspected to be with child, she was conveyed from one place to another upon a sledge, for examination, or some such purpose. It appears from the proof, that she was delivered in the course of conveyance upon this sledge, among some straw, and in the presence, but without the knowledge, of two men and two women, who were conducting her. The discovery was made, by one of the child's feet appearing through the straw. She was convicted, and had sentence of death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="537"/>
IN regard to the benefit of this defence; there is a plain
reason why it must always have been greater than that of
revealing the pregnancy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calling for Help; its Effect.</NOTE> Though the pannel have re∣vealed,
she is still liable to the charge of criminal ne∣glect
with respect to the time of birth; whereas the cal∣ling
for assistance on that occasion not only reveals the
pregnancy, but reveals it at the very time when the
disclosure is of greatest service to the child, and gives the
fullest assurance of the mother's resolution to preserve it;
since, if any harm were meant it, this were the season when
the most anxious concealment would be used. Acordingly,
there is no instance of any sentence following on ver∣dict
finding this defence proved, nor of interlocutor restrict∣ing
the libel to an arbitrary punishment upon such a ground.
Indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. &amp; 6. 1762.</NOTE> the interlocutor in the case of Anne Davidson, ex∣pressly
finds this defence relevant to elide the libel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. &amp;. 14. 1726.</NOTE> And
in that of Isobel Stirling, the distinction is pointedly made
between the two defences, by sustaining the one as relevant
to elide, and the other to restrict only<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel, as founded on the act of Parliament 1690 li∣belled on, relelvant to infer the pains of death and confiscation of moveables: But for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liding simpliciter</HI> the foresaid relevancy, sustain this defence, <HI>viz.</HI> that the said pannel called for help and assistance to her the time of her birth; and for <HI>restricting</HI> the foresaid relevancy to an arbitrary punishment, sustain this defence, <HI>viz.</HI> that the pannel while she was with the said child did reveal to others that she was so.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="538"/>
THESE being the qualities which the statute has expressly
required in the charge, does it farther lie on the prosecutor to
prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Child be proved to be ripe.</NOTE> that the child was a ripe child, produced at the full
time, and born alive? This is not by any means the rule.
It was, on the contrary, here,—in the difficulty of bringing
such a proof,—that the main inducement lay to the passing of
such a statute. If the body were missing, or were not found
until dissolved by time, the prosecutor was excluded from all
the means of showing that the child was born alive; and as
little could he prove the duration of the pregnancy, so as to
show that it might be a living birth, in a situation where the
fact itself of pregnancy is always studiously concealed. To
relieve him, therefore, from this difficulty, and in conside∣ration
that the blameable conduct of the woman, in conceal∣ing
her state, and refusing assistance, is the cause of this
embarrassment, and is withal ground of suspicion against
her; the statute has shifted this disadvantage in point of
proof over to her side, and has made the inference against her,
that the child <HI>was</HI> born alive, and <HI>was</HI> murdered by her the
mother. This is plain from the expressions and whole con∣text
of the act, which declares, that in these circumstances,
of concealed pregnancy and unassisted birth, the mother
shall be reputed the <HI>murderer</HI> of her child that is found dead
or is missing; in which it assumes and implies, that the child
has once been alive, to be destroyed. Though it has occa∣sionally
been done, the prosecutor need not therefore attempt
any proof, less or more, to that effect, (a proof, which is in∣deed
impossible if the child be missing); nor need he even
aver in his libel, that the pannel was delivered at the full
time, or of a ripe or living child. Among the many inter∣locutors
which have been pronounced on charges of this
sort, (charges far more numerous than for any other kind of
<PB N="480" REF="539"/>
murder), there are, as far as I have observed, but two, which
have any allusion to the maturity of the child; those in the
case of Jean Davidson;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. 1729. Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1734.</NOTE> and Jean Cowan; in both of which
the prosecutor, having proof of the maturity of the child,
had thought it proper to lay and circumscribe his libel in that
manner; and in this the interlocutor naturally followed the
libel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1715.</NOTE> But in the case of Elizabeth Johnston, where the libel
did not state the duration of the pregnancy, nor affirm that the
child was ripe or born alive, or had come to that maturity
that it might have life, the exception taken on that ground was,
after full debate, repelled, and interlocutor was given in the
ordinary style<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The pannel argues thus, “That though the libel bears that the pannel con∣cealed her being with child during the whole space, yet it does not condescend how long that space was. And no person can be tried for their life upon an indefinite libel. For if the concealment be for a month or two, it will not be contended that such a concealment, (although abortion had followed), would have fallen under the said act of Parliament. And yet that case would have fallen under the generality of the present libel. At least, the libel should have been, that the child was come to the maturity of a ripe child, so as to have life.”</NOTE>, without any mention of ripe or living birth.
The same objection was again repelled in the case of Helen
Marshall<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the said pannel having been <HI>with child,</HI> and concealing the same during the whole space, and not calling for nor making use of help in the birth, and that the child was found dead or amissing, jointly relevant to infer the foresaid pains.” In this libel, certain circumstances were farther laid, for inferring the pannel to be the actual murderer of her child, independently of the presumption of the statute. Now, in sustaining <HI>these,</HI> the same interlocutor pointedly distinguishes, and requires proof of the child having been ripe, thus: “And, <HI>separatim,</HI> find the following facts, <HI>viz.</HI> That the pannel, the time fore∣said, brought forth a <HI>ripe</HI> child as appeared, &amp;c. relevant to infer the pannel's guilt of the said crime.”</NOTE>; and a third time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. and Mar. 8. 1720. Mar. 22. 1743.</NOTE> in that of Margaret Stuart.
<PB N="481" REF="540"/>
In several other cases, such as that of Anne Reid, this point
after being started,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14. 1720.</NOTE> is given up.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Birth be proved to be unripe.</NOTE> although the Legislature have seen cause thus far to
relieve the prosecutor, and to raise a presumption against the
pannel, that the child was born alive; yet still it does not
follow, (nor would such a purpose be reconcileable to justice),
that this shall be an absolute presumption, which the pan∣nel
may not redargue by any proof on her part. If the
body of the child has been found, and she will undertake to
show, by the clear opinion of those who inspected it, (being
competent judges of such a matter), that it was a mere
abortion, and of such a period that it never could have been
quick; certainly this is a relevant defence to elide the sta∣tute,
and which she must be allowed to prove. Indeed, even by
the older practice, it was su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tained to lower the charge to an
arbitrary pain, if the pannel, without saying that the child
never had quickened, alleged that it was unripe, and born
considerably before the full time: this probably, on a pre∣sumption
that she had been suddenly taken with her pains, and
that the child could not have survived. In the case, already
quoted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. and Aug. 5. 1718.</NOTE> of Margaret Crooks, the Court “sustain the defence
of her having revealed her being with child; or, <HI>separatim,</HI>
her child not being brought to the full time, relevant to
restrict the crime as libelled to an arbitrary pain.” In
the case of Mary Nicol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. &amp; 13. 1705.</NOTE> who alleged that her delivery was
in the sixth month, verdict was returned, finding the quali∣fications
of the statute proved, but with this addition, “but
does not find it proven that the child was come to the
full time;” whereupon she had sentence to be scourged,
and to be confined three years in the house of correc∣tion<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The expressions of this verdict and incorrect, and at first sight seem to lay upon the prosecutor the burden of proving that the child was ripe. But the real meaning was to find <HI>negative</HI> upon that article, in favour of the woman.</NOTE>.
<PB N="482" REF="541"/>
Again; it was sustained to restrict the libel against
Marion Burnet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1709.</NOTE> that she had revealed
her pregnancy to the
father of the child, <HI>and</HI> that she had not gone to the full
time. On the 20th December 1700, Jean Hay was convict∣ed
on her own confession, which bore, that she concealed
her pregnancy, and did not call for help, but that the child
was still-born, and born long before the time: She was ad∣judged
to be scourged and banished.</P>
<P>FARTHER still;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is the statutory Presumption ab∣solute in all Cases?</NOTE> though the child be born at the full time,
yet neither is the presumption absolute against the mother,
in every case, that it must have been killed by her. For
what if she be delivered of it at a time when she is delirious
from disease, and incapable of calling for help either to the
child or to herself? This was found relevant to restrict, in
the case of Elizabeth Johnston.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1715.</NOTE> Or what if she allege,
that recently before her delivery she received such blows
and injuries as might probably destroy the child in the
womb, and show proof of this upon the body of the child,
as bearing the plain marks of a dead birth? In short, the
statute has authorised to convict on a certain sort of pre∣sumptive
proof; but which, like all proof of that kind, is
liable to be outweighed by evidence of such things, as are
naturally exclusive of guilt.</P>
<P>THE result of these several considerations is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of Inter∣locutor on the Charge.</NOTE> that, contrary to
the ordinary practice of the Court, an articulate interlocutor
of relevancy is pronounced on the charge; which, since 1743,
<PB N="483" REF="542"/>
has ordinarily been expressed in these or the like terms:
“Find that the said pannel having, time and place libelled,
brought forth a child, which was thereafter found dead;
<HI>and</HI> that during the whole space of her pregnancy she did
conceal her being with child; <HI>and</HI> that she did not call for
help or assistance at the time of the birth; relevant to infer
the pains of death; but for <HI>eliding</HI> this article of the indict∣ment,
allow the pannel to prove, that during her preg∣nancy
she revealed her being with child.” A proof of
all facts and circumstances, to exculpate or alleviate, is at
the same time allowed. In some instances; such as that of
Janet Heatly, March 3. 1761,—of Anne Davidson, July 5.
and 6. 1762,—and of Anne Mackie, August 5. 1776; notice
is also taken of the calling for help as relevant to exculpate:
but this is implied, when the same is found as to the article
of revealing.</P>
<P>IN regard to the persons who may be the objects of this sort
of prosecution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Does the Act apply to married Women?</NOTE> the only controversy which has occurred, is
concerning married women, whether they were meant to be
included under the sanction of the law. This plea was first
started in the trial of Catharine Smith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp;24. 1701.</NOTE> and there, (but whe∣ther
for this or for other reasons cannot be said), the prosecu∣tor,
in the end, thought it proper to restrict his charge. But
though it be probable, that the Legislature had chiefly in
view the case of single women, as those who more frequent∣ly
are under the temptation of concealment; yet there are
no words in the statute to authorise the making an exception
in favour of a married woman, in any case where the pre∣sumption
will suit her condition. Such it is, and one indeed
to which all the reasons of the law more especially apply,
if she become pregnant in the absence of her husband.
<PB N="484" REF="543"/>
The libel was accordingly found relevant in the case of
Margaret Dickson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. and Aug. 3 1724.</NOTE> which was of this precise description;
and she was convicted, and executed. It is even a pos∣sible
case, that a married woman may be interested to con∣ceal
and destroy her infant, though she be cohabiting with
her husband at the time. This will be true, if she was al∣ready
with child to another person, and some months ad∣vanced
in her pregnancy, at the time of her marriage; or if
she have become pregnant during the absence of her hus∣band,
and her time of delivery be so near his return, that
the child cannot pass for his. But no case of this extraordi∣nary
description has yet been tried, though I find that the si∣tuation
had once occurred. For on the 19th November 1711,
Barbara Taylor offers a petition for bail; which bears, that
she stood committed on a charge of murdering her infant,
brought to the world within five months after her marriage.
This petition is refused, though her husband concurs in
it, and sets forth, that he has no doubt of the child being
his, and that she had revealed her situation to him some
time before.</P>
<P>I HAVE now nothing more to add respecting the na∣ture
of a libel on the act 1690;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge on the Act 1690, does it allow Art and Part?</NOTE> if it be not that it is in the
singular situation in the law, of not admitting a charge of
<HI>art and part.</HI> The statute, in its whole strain and context,
has immediate relation to the mother alone, who is supposed
to be the one person in the world, that is conscious of the
wicked purpose. If, therefore, the case should happen, that
she calls assistance to the birth, but on her own account
only, and not to preserve, but to destroy the child; which
with the aid of this associate she does; the associate must
be tried by the ordinary rules of law, as for the actual mur∣der.
<PB N="485" REF="544"/>
In one instance, a trial on the statute had, however,
been attempted. On the 14th November 1720, Anne Brown
was indicted on the act 1690, for the murder of her child;
and in the same libel, William Reid, the alleged father, was
indicted, “as art and part with the said Anne Brown in the
said murder; at least as accessory to her bringing forth the
said child without calling for or making use of help, and
burying the same in the trench of the Citadel of Leith; in
so far as,” &amp;c. Certain circumstances are afterwards
charged to infer his participation of the murder; such as his
scandalous conversation with the mother till near the time of
her delivery, his concealment of certain linens when she
was imprisoned, and the like. This mode of charge was
objected to on the part of both pannels, as incompetent
and contradictory. And although, in his information, the
prosecutor abandoned the charge of art and part, and only
insisted on the criminal conversation and concealment of
the linens, as separate crimes of their own fort, and relevant
to infer an arbitrary pain; yet, in the end, it was judged ne∣cessary
entirely to desert this libel, and indict the woman,
singly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. &amp; 30. 1720.</NOTE> of new. She was convicted and executed. But there
were no farther proceedings against Reid.</P>
<P>THE act 1690 concludes with a provision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promulgation of the Act 1690.</NOTE> very proper to be
made on such an occasion, for the due notification of this new
law to the inhabitants of the land, by publication of the act,
at the market-cross of the head hurgh of every shire, and by
reading at the church of every parish. But it has repeatedly
been found, and especially in the case of Orrock and Johnston,
in March 1715, that it is not necessary for the prosecutor to
aver that any such promulgation was made. It has been ar∣gued,
that this provision was at any rate only added <HI>ob ma∣jorem
<PB N="486" REF="545"/>
cautelam,</HI> and not as a condition of the law. But con∣cerning
this it is needless to inquire at the present day, after
the statute has for more than a century been put to exe∣cution.</P>
<P>I HERE close my analysis of this rigorous edict. Yet it
is difficult to dismiss the subject, without taking notice of the
great number of capital sentences which have been pronoun∣ced,
and I am afraid executed, on the statutory evidence
alone<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of Anne Davidson, July 5. 6. 1762, an eminent physician and man-midwife, (Dr Young), swore, that the swimming of the lungs was not a cer∣tain symptom of living birth: For that this would happen if the child gave but a single sob, though it died in the birth; and that it might also be the effect of putrefaction. Mr Alexander Wood, surgeon, also swore, that at the distance of eight or ten days, there are no certain symptoms by which physicians can say, whether the child was born to the full time or not. See the above quoted paper of Dr Hunter's, to the same effect.</NOTE>. Such, indeed, was the facility of conviction laid
open by the statute, as had at one time betrayed both pro∣secutor
and Judges, into a degree of slovenliness, and of
indecent haste, in trials for child-murder, to which I find
nothing to be compared with respect to any other article
of our criminal system. Of this I need give no stronger
proof than the practice, which was far from uncommon,
of carrying on sundry trials for child-murder, in one sit∣ting,
and before the same assize, who inclosed, and re∣turned
their verdicts on the several libels into Court, at one
time<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the 3d March 1709, Bessy Turnbell, Isobel Taylor, Margaret Inglis, each for murdering her own child, are sent to one assize, who convict two of them.</NOTE>. The latest conviction on the statute, was that of
Anne Mackie, on the 5th of August 1776. Of late years,
in cases where the charge has been upon the statute only,
and which have otherwise been favourable to the pannel,
<PB N="487" REF="546"/>
it has been common for the prosecutor to consent to the pan∣nel's
petition, praying to be banished forth of Scotland, or
for other arbitrary punishment.</P>
<P>IN the way of Appendix to this of child-murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Expo∣sure of Infant Children.</NOTE> I shall
here subjoin a few words concerning another very frequent
offence against infant children, and which too, may some∣times
issue in their death: I mean, the desertion and exposure
of them to the risk of what may happen. One can imagine
cases of exposure, (and such have already been taken notice
of), which seem more properly to be cases of murder, if the
death of the infant shall ensue, than of any inferior offence.
But even where the child is not abandoned in such a way as
bears evidence of a resolution to destroy it; still for the mo∣ther
to desert her helpless issue, and expose it to any mate∣rial
risk of perishing, though it should not die in conse∣quence,
and much more where it does, cannot but be con∣strued
a high crime. Indeed, if the child die, though only
accidentally, and by connection with the exposure; as if it
be exposed in a field, and is killed by the cattle treading on
it, or on a highway, and is crushed to death by a carriage
running over it; the crime seems to be no other than a species
of culpable homicide. Mary Graham was indicted for in∣cest,
and for the exposure of her new born child, “naked as it
came into the world,” in a field of corn, where it was after∣wards
found dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1703.</NOTE> The Court found this part of the charge,
(though certainly not very remote from murder), relevant to
infer an arbitrary punishment; and being convicted on her
own confession<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Her confession bore, “That she did expose and lay it out, naked as it was born, amongst the corn, immediately after the birth.”</NOTE>, she was sentenced to be scourged, and to be
<PB N="488" REF="547"/>
confined in the house of correction, till the magistrates of the
burgh should dispose of her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9. 22. 23. 26. 1754.</NOTE> The case of Isobel Kilgour,
which also issued in a sentence of scourging and banishment,
was nearly of the same description. In the month of March,
and about five of the evening, and in severe weather, she had
exposed her child, of about three weeks old, upon a sandy bank
near the road from Inveresk to Leith, and had there left it,
stuffed into a rabbit's hole, (as appears on the proof), with its
head inwards, and the sand gathered up to the mouth of the
hole, so that the body lay for ten or twelve days unobserved.
The libel was laid as for murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And there murdered the foresaid child, by putting it into a hole in a san∣dy bank, near to the road leading from Inveresk to Leith, where it died im∣mediately, or soon thereafter. At least, time and place foresaid, she left the said child <HI>upon the foresaid ground,</HI> exposed to the cold at that season of the year, where it died in a short space thereafter, and in which place its dead body was found.” It concludes thus: “At least, time and place foresaid, the said child was murdered, <HI>or left upon the ground,</HI> exposed to the cold, without any help or assistance, whereby itdied immediately, or soon thereafter.”</NOTE>, and was found relevant, in
general terms, to infer the pains of law. The jury found
her “guilty of <HI>exposing</HI> her child <HI>in terms of the libel,</HI> which
was the cause of the child's death.” Now, the libel did
not relate some of the strong circumstances above mention∣ed,
and bore an alternative charge, of <HI>putting the child in∣to
a hole,</HI> or <HI>leaving it exposed upon the ground.</HI> On this re∣ference
in the verdict to the libel, the Court could do no
other than adopt the more favourable account of an expo∣sure
<HI>upon the ground,</HI> and at no great distance from a high∣way.
And thus the pannel's life was saved.</P>
<P>I HAVE followed the example of Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Self-Murder.</NOTE> in reser∣ving
self-murder (though there is very little to be said on
it), as the subject of a separate article; being an offence,
<PB N="489" REF="548"/>
of a nature quite distinct from any other instance of ho∣micide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SELF MURDER.</NOTE>
Though it may be contrary to popular belief, there
seems to be no law, nor practice<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See on this head the judicious opinion given in the case of Mungo Camp∣bell. Maclaurin, p. 531.</NOTE>, for inflicting any in∣dignity
on the remains of those unfortunate persons, who
finish their course in this unnatural way. But according
to all authorities<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Skene's Treatise of Crimes. Craig, lib. 1. dieg. 16. No. 32.; lib. 3. dieg. 6. No. 18.</NOTE>, the ordinary patrimonial consequence
of homicide takes place against their executors, in the con∣fiscation
of all their moveable goods; which is made effec∣tual
on establishment of the fact, in an action of declarator
before the Supreme Court. Craig has mentioned the case of
Thomas Dobbie, in which it was judged, that even the plea
of madness is not relevant to hinder this penalty from taking
place, “<HI>Neque insaniae objectio recepta, cum nemo sanus id face∣ret.</HI>”
But this seems to be an insufficient reason; and all
later authorities have held that judgment to be wrong.</P>
