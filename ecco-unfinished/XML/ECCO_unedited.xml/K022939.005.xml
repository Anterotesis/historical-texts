<PB N="iii" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER, Occasioned by the first correct Edition of the DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with pleasure I hear, that you have pro∣cured a correct copy of the DUNCIAD, which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so necessary; and it is yet with more, that I am in∣formed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY: A Work so requisite, that I cannot think the Au∣thor himself would have omitted it, had he ap∣proved of the first appearance of this Poem.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Notes</HI> as have occurred to me I herewith send you: You will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are, or will be, transmitted to you by others; since not only the Author's
<PB N="iv" REF="10"/>
friends, but even strangers, appear engaged by hu∣manity, to take some care of an Orphan of so much genius and spirit, which its parent seems to have abandoned from the very beginning, and suf∣fered to step into the world naked, unguarded, and unattended.</P>
<P>It was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately published, that my great regard to a Person, whose Friendship I esteem as one of the chief ho∣nours of my life, and a much greater respect to Truth, than to him or any man living, engaged me in enquiries, of which the inclosed <HI>Notes</HI> are the fruit.</P>
<P>I perceived, that most of these Authors had been (doubtless very wisely) the first aggressors. They had tried, 'till they were weary, what was to be got by railing at each other: Nobody was either concerned or surprized, if this or that scri∣bler was proved a dunce. But every one was cu∣rious to read what could be said to prove Mr. POPE one, and was ready to pay something for such a discovery: A stratagem, which would they fairly own, it might not only reconcile them to me, but screen them from the resentment of their lawful Superiors, whom they daily abuse, only (as I cha∣ritably hope) to get that <HI>by</HI> them, which they can∣not get <HI>from</HI> them.</P>
<P>I found this was not all: Ill success in that had transported them to Personal abuse, either of him∣self, or (what I think he could less forgive) of his
<PB N="v" REF="11"/>
Friends. They had called Men of virtue and ho∣nour bad Men, long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them bad Writers: And some had been such old offenders, that he had quite forgot∣ten their persons as well as their slanders, 'till they were pleased to revive them.</P>
<P>Now what had Mr. POPE done before, to in∣cense them? He had published those works which are in the hands of every body, in which not the least mention is made of any of them. And what has he done since? He has laughed, and written the DUNCIAD. What has that said of them? A very serious truth, which the public had said be∣fore, that they were dull: And what it had no sooner said, but they themselves were at great pains to procure, or even purchase room in the prints, to testify under their hands to the truth of it.</P>
<P>I should still have been silent, if either I had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious with such accusers, or if they had only meddled with his Writ∣ings; since whoever publishes, puts himself on his trial by his Country. But when his Moral cha∣racter was attacked, and in a manner from which neither truth nor virtue can secure the most inno∣cent, in a manner, which, though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and im∣partial, yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accusers; I mean by Authors <HI>without names;</HI> then I thought, since the danger was common to all, the concern ought to be so; and that it was an act
<PB N="vi" REF="12"/>
of justice to detect the Authors, not only on this account, but as many of them are the same who for several years past have made free with the great∣est names in Church and State, exposed to the world the private misfortunes of Families, abused all, even to Women, and whose prostituted papers (for one or other Party, in the unhappy divisions of their Country) have insulted the Fallen, the Friendless, the Exil'd, and the Dead.</P>
<P>Besides this, which I take to be a public con∣cern, I have already confessed I had a private one. I am one of that number who have long loved and esteemed Mr. POPE; and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings (which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character) but the honest, open, and beneficent man, that we most esteemed, and loved in him. Now, if what these people say were believed, I must appear to all my friends either a fool, or a knave; either im∣posed on myself, or imposing on them; so that I am as much interested in the confutation of these calumnies, as he is himself.</P>
<P>I am no Author, and consequently not to be suspected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the Men, of whom scarce one is known to me by sight; and as for their Writings, I have sought them (on this one occasion) in vain, in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance. I had still been in the dark, if a Gentleman had not procured me (I suppose from some of themselves,
<PB N="vii" REF="13"/>
for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies) the passages I send you. I solemn∣ly protest I have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them; which it behoves me to de∣clare, since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost. You may in some mea∣sure prevent it, by preserving at least their Titles <SUP>a</SUP>, and discovering (as far as you can depend on the truth of your information) the Names of the con∣cealed authors.</P>
<P>The first objection I have heard made to the Poem is, that the persons are too <HI>obscure</HI> for satire. The persons themselves, rather than allow the objection, would forgive the satire; and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer, were not all assassinates, popular insurrections, the in∣solence of the rabble without doors, and of domes∣tics within, most wrongfully chastised, if the Mean∣ness of offenders indemnified them from punish∣ment? On the contrary, Obscurity renders them more dangerous, as less thought of: Law can pro∣nounce judgment only on open facts; Morality a∣lone can pass censure on intentions of mischief; so that for secret calumny, or the arrow flying in the dark, there is no public punishment left, but what a good Writer inflicts.</P>
<P>The next objection is, that these sort of authors are <HI>poor.</HI> That might be pleaded as an excuse at <NOTE PLACE="foot">1 Which we have done in a List printed in the Appendix.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="14"/>
the Old Baily, for lesser crimes than Defamation, (for 'tis the case of almost all who are tried there) but sure it can be none: For who will pretend that the robbing another of his Reputation supplies the want of it in himself? I question not but such au∣thors are poor, and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest livelihood. But Poverty is here the accident, not the subject: He who de∣scribes Malice and Villany to be pale and meagre, expresses not the least anger against Paleness or Leanness, but against Malice and Villany. The Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet is poor; but is he therefore justified in vending poison? Not but Poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire, when it is the consequence of vice, prodigality, or neg∣lect of one's lawful calling; for then it increases the public burden, fills the streets and highways with Robbers, and the garrets with Clippers, Coiners, and Weekly Journalists.</P>
<P>But admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals, than in their writings; must Poverty make nonsense sacred? If so, the fame of bad au∣thors would be much better consulted than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of an hundred had ever been called by his right name.</P>
<P>They mistake the whole matter: It is not cha∣rity to encourage them in the way they follow, but to get them out of it; for men are not bung∣lers because they are poor, but they are poor be∣cause they are bunglers.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="15"/>
Is it not pleasant enough, to hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their persons and characters were too sacred for Satire; and the pub∣lic objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for Ridicule? But whether Bread or Fame be their end, it must be allowed, our author, by and in this Poem, has mercifully given them a little of both.</P>
<P>There are two or three, who by their rank and fortune have no benefit from the former objec∣tions, supposing them good, and these I was sorry to see in such company. But if, without any pro∣vocation, two or three Gentlemen will fall upon one, in an affair wherein his interest and reputa∣tion are equally embarked; they cannot certainly, after they have been content to print themselves his enemies, complain of being put into the number of them.</P>
<P>Others, I am told, pretend to have been once his Friends. Surely they are their enemies who say so, since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done. But of this I can∣not persuade myself, when I consider the constant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one.</P>
<P>Such as claim a merit from being his Admirers I would gladly ask, if it lays him under a perso∣nal obligation? At that rate he would be the most obliged humble servant in the world. I dare swear for these in particular, he never desired them to be his
<PB N="x" REF="16"/>
admirers, nor promised in return to be theirs: That had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance; but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse than ignorance, in the author of the Essay on Criticism? Be it as it will, the reasons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally subsisting, for his works and theirs are the very same that they were.</P>
<P>One, therefore, of their assertions I believe may be true, <Q>“That he has a contempt for their writ∣ings.”</Q> And there is another, which would pro∣bably be sooner allowed by himself than by any good judge beside, <Q>“That his own have found too much success with the public.”</Q> But as it cannot con∣sist with his modesty to claim this as a justice, it lies not on him, but entirely on the public, to de∣fend its own judgment.</P>
<P>There remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people, than any they have made use of. If Obscurity or Poverty were to ex∣empt a man from satire, much more should Folly or Dulness, which are still more involuntary; nay, as much so as personal Deformity. But even this will not help them: Deformity becomes an object of Ridicule when a man sets up for being hand∣some; and so must Dulness when he sets up for a Wit. They are not ridiculed because Ridicule in itself is, or ought to be, a pleasure; but because it is just to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from imposition, be∣cause
<PB N="xi" REF="17"/>
particular interest ought to yield to general, and a great number who are not naturally Fools, ought never to be made so, in complaisance to a few who are. Accordingly we find that in all ages, all vain pretenders, were they ever so poor or ever so dull, have been constantly the topics of the most candid satirists, from the Codrus of JU∣VENAL to the Damon of BOILEAU.</P>
<P>Having mentioned BOILEAU, the greatest Poet and most judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his Talents, and yet perhaps more admirable for his Judgment in the proper applica∣tion of them; I cannot help remarking the re∣semblance betwixt him and our author, in Quali∣ties, Fame, and Fortune; in the distinctions shewn them by their Superiors, in the general esteem of their Equals, and in their extended reputation a∣mongst Foreigners; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate, as he has had for his Translators persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Essay on Crititism, in French verse, by General Ha∣milton; the same, in verse al∣so, by Monsieur Roboton, Counsellor and Privy Secretary to King George I. after by the Abbé Reynel, in verse, with notes. Rape of the Lock, in French, by the Princess of Con∣ti, Paris 1728. and in Italian verse, by the Abbé Conti, a Noble Venetian; and by the Marquis Rangoni, Envoy Ex∣traordinary from Modena to King George II. Others of his works by Salvini of Florence, &amp;c. His Essays and Disserta∣tions on Homer, several times translated in French. Essay on Man, by the Abbé Reynel, in verse; by Monsieur Silhouet, in prose, 1737. and since by others in French, Italian, and Latin.</NOTE>. But the re∣semblance
<PB N="xii" REF="18"/>
holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abused by the ignorant pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the least me∣mory will remain but in their own Writings, and in the Notes made upon them. What BOILEAU has done in almost all his poems, our author has only in this: I dare answer for him he will do it in no more; and on this principle, of attacking few but who had slandered him, he could not have done it at all, had he been confined from censuring obscure and worthless persons, for scarce any other were his enemies. However, as the parity is so remarkable, I hope it will continue to the last; and if ever he shall give us an edition of this Poem himself, I may see some of them treated as gently, on their repentance or better merit, as Perrault and Quinault were at last by BOILEAU.</P>
<P>In one point I must be allowed to think the cha∣racter of our English Poet the more amiable. He has not been a follower of Fortune or Success; he has lived with the Great without flattery; been a friend to Men in power, without pensions, from whom, as he asked, so he received no favour, but what was done Him in his Friends. As his Satires were the more just for being delayed, so were his Panegyrics; bestowed only on such per∣sons as he had familiarly known, only for such virtues as he had long observed in them, and only at such times as others cease to praise, if not begin
<PB N="xiii" REF="19"/>
to calumniate them, I mean when out of power or out of fashion <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">As Mr. Wycherly, at the time the Town declaimed a∣gainst his book of Poems; Mr. Walsh, after his death; Sir William Trumbull, when he had resigned the Office of Secretary of State; Lord Bo∣lingbroke, at his leaving Eng∣land after the Queen's death; Lord Oxford in his last decline of life; Mr. Secretary Craggs, at the end of the South-Sea year, and after his death: Others only in Epitaphs.</NOTE>. A satire, therefore, on writers so notorious for the contrary practice, became no man so well as himself; as none, it is plain, was so little in their friendships, or so much in that of those whom they had most abused, namely the Greatest and Best of all Parties. Let me add a further reason, that, though engaged in their Friendships, he never espoused their Animosities; and can almost singly challenge this honour, not to have written a line of any man, which, through Guilt, through Shame, or through Fear, through variety of Fortune, or change of Interests, he was ever unwilling to own.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with remarking what a plea∣sure it must be to every reader of Humanity, to see all along, that our Author in his very laughter is not indulging his own ill-nature, but only pu∣nishing that of others. As to his Poem, those a∣lone are capable of doing it justice, who, to use the words of a great writer, know how hard it is (with regard both to his subject and his manner) VETUSTIS DARE NOVITATEM, OBSOLETIS NI∣TOREM,</P>

<HEAD>TESTIMONIES OF AUTHORS CONCERNING our POET and his WORKS.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. SCRIBLERUS Lectori S.</SPEAKER>
<P>BEFORE we present thee with our exerci∣tations on this most delectable Poem (drawn from the many volumes of our Adversaria on modern Authors) we shall here, according to the lau∣dable usage of editors, collect the various judgments of the Learned concerning our Poet: Various indeed, not only of different authors, but of the same author at different seasons. Nor shall we gather only the Testimonies of such eminent Wits, as would of course descend to posterity, and consequently be read with∣out our collection; but we shall likewise with incredible labour seek out for divers others, which, but for this our diligence, could never at the distance of a few months appear to the eye of the most curious. Here∣by thou may'st not only receive the delectation of Va∣riety, but also arrive at a more certain judgment, by a grave and circumspect comparison of the Witnesses with each other, or of each with himself. Hence also thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections, not only of a critical, but a moral nature, by being let into many
<PB N="xx" REF="25"/>
particulars of the Person as well as Genius, and of the Fortune as well as Merit, of our Author: In which if I relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee, and some of as little even to him; I entreat thee to consider how minutely all true critics and commen∣tators are wont to insist upon such, and how material they seem to themselves, if to none other. Forgive me, gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon become tedious: allow me to take the same pains to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, modest or arrogant; as another, whether his author was fair or brown, short or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a cassock.</P>
<P>We purposed to begin with his Life, Parentage, and Education: But as to these, even his cotemporaries do exceedingly differ. One saith <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Giles Jacob's Lives of Poets, vol. ii. in his Life.</NOTE>, he was educated at home; another <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dennis's Reflect. on the Es∣say on Crit.</NOTE>, that he was bred at St. Omer's by Jesuits; a third <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dunciad dissected, p. 4.</NOTE>, not at St. Omer's, but at Oxford; a fourth <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guardian, No 40.</NOTE>, that he had no University education at all. Those who allow him to be bred at home, differ as much concerning his Tutor: One saith <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jacob's Lives, &amp;c. vol. ii.</NOTE>, he was kept by his father on purpose; a second <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dunciad dissected, p. 4.</NOTE>, that he was an itinerant priest; a third <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Farmer P. and his son.</NOTE>, that he was a parson; one<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dunc. dissect.</NOTE> calleth him a secular clergyman of the Church of Rome; another <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Characters of the times, p. 45.</NOTE>, a monk. As little do they agree about his Father, whom one<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Female Dunc. p. ult.</NOTE> supposeth, like the Father of He∣siod, a tradesman or merchant; another <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dunc. dissect.</NOTE>, a husband∣man; another <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Roome, Paraphrase on the 4th of Genesis, printed 1729.</NOTE>, a hatter, &amp;c. Nor has an author been wanting to give our Poet such a father as Apuleius hath to Plato, Jamblichus to Pythagoras, and divers to
<PB N="xxi" REF="26"/>
Homer, namely a Daemon: For thus Mr. Gildon <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Character of Mr. P. and his Writings, in a Letter to a Friend, printed for S. Popping, 1716, p. 10. Curl, in his Key to the Dunciad (first edit. said to be printed for A. Dodd) in the 10th page, declared Gildon to be au∣thor of that libel; though in the subsequent editions of his Key he left out this assertion, and affirmed (in the Curliad, p. 4. and 8.) that it was written by Dennis only.</NOTE>: <Q>“Certain it is, that his original is not from Adam, but the Devil; and that he wanteth nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance of his infernal Father.”</Q> Finding, therefore, such contrariety of opi∣nions, and (whatever be ours of this sort of generation) not being fond to enter into controversy, we shall defer writing the life of our Poet, 'till authors can determine among themselves what Parents or Education he had, or whether he had any Education or Parents at all.</P>
<P>Proceed we to what is more certain, his Works, tho' not less uncertain the judgments concerning them; be∣ginning with his ESSAY on CRITICISM, of which hear first the most ancient of Critics,</P>

<P><Q>“”<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Spectator, No 253.</NOTE> The Art of Criticism (saith he) which was pub∣lished some months since, is a master-piece in its kind. The observations follow one another, like those in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose
<PB N="xxiii" REF="28"/>
writer. They are some of them <HI>uncommon,</HI> but such as the reader must assent to, when he sees them explain'd with that ease and perspicuity in which they are delivered. As for those which are the <HI>most known</HI> and the most <HI>receiv'd,</HI> they are placed in so beautiful a light, and illustrated with such apt allusions, that they have in them all the graces of novelty; and make the reader, who was before acquainted with them, still more convinced of their truth and soli∣dity. And here give me leave to mention what Monsieur Boileau has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his works: That wit and fine writing doth not consist so much in advancing things that are new, as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn. It is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world, to make observations in criticism, morality, or any art or science, which have not been touch'd upon by others; we have little else left us, but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong, more beautiful, or more uncommon lights. If a reader examines Horace's Art of Poe∣try, he will find but few precepts in it, which he may not meet with in Aristotle, and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the Augustan age. His way of expressing, and applying them, not his invention of them, is what we are chiefly to admire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Longinus, in his Reflexions, has given us the same kind of sublime, which he observes in the se∣veral passages that occasioned them: I cannot but take notice that our English author has after the same manner exemplified several of the precepts in the very precepts themselves.”</Q> He then produces some instances of a particular beauty in the numbers, and concludes with saying, that <Q>“there are three poems in our tongue of the same nature, and each a master-piece in its kind; The Essay on Trans∣lated
<PB N="xxiv" REF="29"/>

<P>Of the Epistle of ELOISA, we are told by the ob∣scure writer of a poem called Sawney, <Q>“That because Prior's Henry and Emma charm'd the finest tastes, our author writ his Eloise, <HI>in opposition to it;</HI> but forgot innocence and virtue: If you take away her tender thoughts, and her fierce desires, all the rest is of no value.”</Q> In which, methinks, his judgment resembleth that of a French taylor on a Villa and gar∣dens by the Thames: <Q>“All this is very fine, but take away the river, and it is good for nothing.”</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LEWIS THEOBALD</SPEAKER>
<P>thus extols it <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Censor, vol. ii. n. 33.</NOTE>, <Q>“The spirit of Homer breathes all through this translation.—I am in doubt, whether I should most admire the justness to the original, or the force and beauty of the language, or the sounding variety of the numbers: But when I find all these meet, it puts me in mind of what the poet says of one of his heroes, That he alone rais'd and flung with ease a weighty stone, that two common men could not lift from the ground; just so, one single person has performed in this translation, what I once de∣spaired to have seen done by the force of several ma∣sterly hands.”</Q> Indeed the same gentleman appears to have chang'd his sentiment in his Essay on the Art of sinking in reputation, (printed in Mist's Journal, March 30, 1728.) where he says thus: <Q>“In order to sink in reputation, let him take it into his head to descend
<PB N="xxvi" REF="31"/>
into Homer (let the world wonder, as it will, how the devil he got there) and pretend to do him into English, so his version denote his neglect of the manner how.”</Q> Strange Variation! We are told in</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIST'S JOURNAL, June 8.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“That this translation of the Iliad was not in all re∣spects conformable to the fine taste of his friend Mr. Addison; insomuch that he employed a <HI>younger muse,</HI> in an undertaking of this kind, which he supervised himself.”</Q> Whether Mr. Addison did find it con∣formable to his taste, or not, best appears from his own testimony the year following its publication, in these words:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ADDISON, FREEHOLDER, No 40.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“When I consider myself as a British freeholder, I am in a particular manner pleased with the labours of those who have improved our language with the translations of old Greek and Latin authors.—We have already most of their Historians in our own tongue, and, what is more for the honour of our lan∣guage, it has been taught to express with elegance the greatest of their Poets in each nation. The illite∣rate among our own countrymen may learn to judge from Dryden's Virgil of the most perfect Epic performance. And those parts of Homer which have been published already by Mr. Pope, give us rea∣son to think that the Iliad will appear in English with as little disadvantage to that immortal poem.”</Q></P>
<P>As to the rest, there is a slight mistake, for this <HI>younger muse</HI> was an <HI>elder:</HI> Nor was the gentleman (who is a friend of our author) employ'd by Mr. Addison to translate it <HI>after him,</HI> since he saith himself that he did it <HI>before</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vid. pref. to Mr. Tickel's translation of the first book of the Iliad, 4to.</NOTE> Contrariwise that Mr. Addison engaged our author in this work appeareth by declaration there∣of

in the preface to the Iliad, printed some time before his death, and by his own letters of October 26, and November 2, 1713. where he declares it is his opinion, that no other person was equal to it.</P>

<P><Q>“the sequel of that work, the Odyssey; and having secured the success by a numerous subscription, he employed some <HI>underlings</HI> to perform what, accord∣ing to his proposals, should come from his own hands.”</Q> To which heavy charge we can in truth oppose nothing but the words of</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. POPE'S PROPOSAL for the ODYSSEY,</SPEAKER>
<P>(printed by J. Watts, Jan. 10, 1724.)</P>

<PB N="xxviii" REF="33"/>
Mist's Journals, March 30, 1728. saying, <Q>“That he would not advise Mr. Pope to try the experiment again of getting a great part of a book done by assist∣ants, lest those extraneous parts should unhappily ascend to the sublime, and retard the declension of the whole.”</Q> Behold! these <HI>Underlings</HI> are become good writers!</P>
<P>If any say, that before the said Proposals were print∣ed, the subscription was begun without declaration of such assistance; verily those who set it on foot, or (as their term is) secured it, to wit, the right honourable the Lord Viscount HARCOURT, were he living, would testify, and the right honourable the Lord BATHURST, now living, doth testify the same is a falshood.</P>

<P><Q>“”<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Daily Journal, March 18, 1728.</NOTE> Upon reading the third volume of Pope's Mis∣cellanies, I found five lines which I thought excel∣lent; and happening to praise them, a gentleman produced a modern comedy (the Rival Modes) pub∣lished last year, where were the same verses to a tittle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagia∣ries, that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a man's works in his own life-time, and out of a Public print.”</Q> Let us join to this what is written by the author of the Rival Modes, the said Mr. James-Moore Smith, in a letter to our author himself, who had informed him, a month before that play was act∣ed, Jan. 27, 1726/7, that <Q>“These verses, which he had before given him leave to insert in it, would be known for his, some copies being got abroad. He desires, nevertheless, that since the lines had been read in his
<PB N="xxx" REF="35"/>
comedy to several, Mr. P. would not deprive it of them,”</Q> &amp;c. Surely, if we add the testimonies of the Lord BOLINGBROKE, of the Lady to whom the said verses were originally addressed, of Hugh Bethel Esq; and others, who knew them as our author's, long be∣fore the said gentleman composed his play; it is hoped, the ingenuous that affect not error, will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honourable personages.</P>

Most true it is, that Mr. Moore had such a design, and was himself the man who prest Dr. Arbuthnot and Mr. Pope to assist him therein; and that he borrowed those Me∣moirs of our author, when that History came forth, with intent to turn them to such abuse. But being able to obtain from our author but one single hint, and ei∣ther changing his mind, or having more mind than abi∣lity, he contented himself to keep the said Memoirs, and read them as his own to all his acquaintance. A no∣ble person there is, into whose company Mr. Pope once chanced to introduce him, who well remembereth the conversation of Mr. Moore to have turned upon the <Q>“Contempt he had for the work of that reverend pre∣late, and how full he was of a design he declared

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. JOHN DENNIS;</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, in his Reflections on the Essay on Criticism, thus describeth him: <Q>“A little affected hypocrite, who has nothing in his mouth but candour, truth, friendship, good-nature, humanity, and magnanimity. He is so great a lover of falshood, that, whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries, he brands them with some defect which is just <HI>contrary to some good quality,</HI> for which all their <HI>friends and their ac∣quaintance</HI> commend them. He seems to have a par∣ticular pique to <HI>People of Quality,</HI> and authors of that rank.—He must derive his religion from St. Omer's.”</Q>—But in the Character of Mr. P. and his writings, (printed by S. Popping, 1716.) he saith, <Q>“Though he
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="39"/>
is a professor of the worst religion, yet he <HI>laughs at it;"</HI> but that "nevertheless, he is a <HI>virulent Pa∣pist;</HI> and yet a <HI>Pillar</HI> for the <HI>Church of England.”</HI></Q> Of both which opinions</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. LEWIS THEOBALD</SPEAKER>
<P>seems also to be; declaring, in Mist's Journal of June 22, 1718. <Q>“That, if he is not shrewdly abused, he made it his practice to cackle to both <HI>parties</HI> in their own sentiments.”</Q> But, as to his <HI>pique</HI> against <HI>People of quality,</HI> the same Journalist doth not agree, but saith (May 8, 1728.) <Q>“He had, by some means or other, the <HI>acquaintance</HI> and <HI>friendship</HI> of the <HI>whole body of our nobility.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>However contradictory this may appear, Mr. Den∣nis and Gildon, in the character last cited, make it all plain, by assuring us, <Q>“That he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions; he is a beast, and a man; a Whig, and a Tory; a writer (at one and the same time) of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Names of two weekly Papers.</NOTE> Guardians and Examiners; an Assertor of liberty, and of the dispensing power of kings; a Jesuitical professor of truth; a base and a foul pretender to candour.”</Q> So that, upon the whole account, we must conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite, or a very honest man; a terrible im∣poser upon both parties, or very moderate to either.</P>
<P>Be it as to the judicious reader shall seem good.

<P>thus wrote<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In a Letter under his hand, dated March 12, 1733.</NOTE> to the unknown author, on the first pub∣lication of the said Essay: <Q>“I must own, after the re∣ception which the vilest and most immoral ribaldry hath lately met with, I was surprised to see what I had long despaired, a performance deserving the name of a poet. Such, Sir, is your work. It is, indeed, above all commendation, and ought to have been published in an age and country more worthy of it. If my testimony be of weight any where, you are sure to have it in the amplest manner,”</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus we see every one of his works hath been ex∣tolled by one or other of his most inveterate Enemies; and to the success of them all they do unanimously give testimony. But it is sufficient, <HI>instar omnium,</HI> to be∣hold the great critic, Mr. Dennis, sorely lamenting it, even from the Essay on Criticism to this day of the Dunciad! <Q>“A most notorious instance (quoth he) of the depravity of genius and taste, the <HI>approbation</HI> this Essay meets with <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dennis, Pref. to his Reflect. on the Essay on Criticism.</NOTE>—I can safely affirm, that I never attacked any of these writings, unless they had <HI>suc∣cess</HI> infinitely beyond their merit.—This, though an empty, has been a <HI>popular</HI> scribler. The epidemic madness of the times has given him <HI>reputation</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pref. to his Rem. on Ho∣mer.</NOTE>.—If, after the cruel treatment so many extraordina∣ry men (Spencer, Lord Bacon, Ben. Johnson, Milton, Butler, Otway, and others) have received from this country, for these last hundred years, I should shift the scene, and shew all that penury changed at once to riot and profuseness; and more squandered away up∣on <HI>one object,</HI> than would have satisfied the greater
<PB N="xl" REF="45"/>
part of those extraordinary men; the reader to whom this one creature should be unknown, would fancy him a prodigy of art and nature, would believe that all the great qualities of these persons were centered in him alone.—But if I should venture to assure him, that the PEOPLE of ENGLAND had made such a choice—the reader would either believe me a <HI>mali∣cious enemy,</HI> and <HI>slanderer;</HI> or that the reign of the last (Queen Anne's) <HI>Ministry</HI> was designed by fate to encourage <HI>Fools</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rem on Homer, p. 8, 9.</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>But it happens, that this our Poet never had any Place, Pension, or Gratuity, in any shape, from the said glorious Queen, or any of her Ministers. All he owed, in the whole course of his life, to any court, was a subscription, for his Homer, of 200<HI>l.</HI> from King George I, and 100<HI>l.</HI> from the prince and princess.</P>
<P>However, lest we imagine our Author's Success was constant and universal, they acquaint us of certain works in a less degree of repute, whereof, although owned by others, yet do they assure us he is the writer. Of this sort Mr. DENNIS<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 8.</NOTE> ascribes to him <HI>two Farces,</HI> whose names he does not tell, but assures us that <HI>there is not one jest in them:</HI> And an imitation of Horace, whose title he does not mention, but assures us <HI>it is much more execrable than all his works</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Character of Mr. Pope, p. 7.</NOTE>. The DAILY JOURNAL, May 11, 1728. assures us, <Q>“He is below Tom. Dur∣fey in the Drama, because (as that writer thinks) the Marriage Hater matched, and the Boarding School are better than the What-d'-ye-call-it;”</Q> which is not Mr. P.'s, but Mr. Gay's. Mr. GILDON assures us, in his New Rehearsal, p. 48. <Q>“That he was writing a <HI>play</HI> of the Lady Jane Grey;”</Q> but it afterwards proved to be Mr. Row's. We are assured by another, <Q>“He wrote a pamphlet called Dr. Andrew Tripe <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 6.</NOTE>;”</Q> which proved to be one Dr. Wagstaff's. Mr. THEOBALD as∣sures
<PB N="xli" REF="46"/>
us, in Mist of the 27th of April, <Q>“That the treatise of the <HI>Profound</HI> is very dull, and that Mr. Pope is the author of it.”</Q> The writer of Gullive∣riana is of another opinion; and says, <Q>“the whole, or greatest part, of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascribed to Gulliver <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gulliv. p. 336.</NOTE>.”</Q> [Here, gentle reader! cannot I but smile at the strange blindness and positiveness of men; knowing the said treatise to ap∣pertain to none other but to me, Martinus Scriblerus.]</P>
<P>We are assured, in Mist of June 8, <Q>“That his own <HI>Plays</HI> and <HI>Farces</HI> would better have adorned the Dun∣ciad, than those of Mr. Theobald; for he had nei∣ther genius for Tragedy nor Comedy.”</Q> Which whether true or not, is not easy to judge; in as much as he hath attempted neither. Unless we will take it for granted, with Mr. Cibber, that his being once very angry at hearing a friend's Play abused, was an infalli∣ble proof the Play was his own; the said Mr. Cibber thinking it impossible for a man to be much concerned for any but himself: <Q>“Now let any man judge (saith he) by this concern, who was the true mother of the child <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Lettter to Mr. P. p. 19.</NOTE>?”</Q></P>
<P>But from all that hath been said, the discerning rea∣der will collect, that it little availed our author to have any Candour, since, when he declared he did not write for others, it was not credited; as little to have any Modesty, since, when he declined writing in any way himself, the presumption of others was imputed to him. If he singly enterprised one great work, he was taxed of Boldness and Madness to a prodigy <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Homerides, p. 1. of his translation of the Iliad.</NOTE>: If he took as∣sistants in another, it was complained of, and repre∣sented as a great injury to the public <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The London and Mist's Jour∣nals, on his undertaking of the Odyssey.</NOTE>. The loftiest heroics, the lowest ballads, treatises against the state or church, satires on lords and ladies, raillery on wits and
<PB N="xlii" REF="47"/>
authors, squabbles with booksellers, or even full and true accounts of monsters, poisons, and murders; of any hereof was there nothing so good, nothing so bad, which hath not at one or other season been to him a∣scribed. If it bore no author's name, then lay he con∣cealed; if it did, he fathered it upon that author to be yet better concealed: If it resembled any of his styles, then was it evident; if it did not, then disguised he it on set purpose. Yea, even direct oppositions in re∣ligion, principles, and politics, have equally been sup∣posed in him inherent. Surely a most rare and singu∣lar character! Of which let the reader make what he can.</P>
<P>Doubtless most Commentators would hence take oc∣casion to turn all to their Author's advantage, and from the testimony of his very Enemies would affirm, That his Capacity was boundless, as well as his Imagina∣tion; that he was a perfect master of all Styles, and all Arguments; and that there was in those times no other Writer, in any kind, of any degree of excellence, save he himself. But as this is not our own sentiment, we shall determine on nothing; but leave thee, gentle rea∣der, to steer thy judgment equally between various opi∣nions, and to chuse whether thou wilt incline to the Testimonies of Authors avowed, or of Authors conceal∣ed; of those who knew him, or of those who knew him not. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS Of the POEM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poem, as it celebrateth the most grave and ancient of things, Chaos, Night, and Dul∣ness; so is it of the most grave and ancient kind. Homer (saith Aristotle) was the first who gave the <HI>Form,</HI> and (saith Horace) who adapted the <HI>Mea∣sure,</HI> to heroic poesy. But even before this, may be rationally presumed from what the Ancients have left written, was a piece by Homer composed, of like na∣ture and matter with this of our poet. For of Epic sort it appeareth to have been, yet of matter surely not unpleasant, witness what is reported of it by the learn∣ed archbishop Eustathius, in Odyss. x. And accord∣ingly Aristotle, in his Poetic, chap. iv. doth further set forth, that as the Iliad and Odyssey gave example to Tragedy, so did this poem to Comedy its first idea.</P>
<P>From these authors also it should seem, that the Hero▪ or chief personage of it was no less <HI>obscure,</HI> and his un∣derstanding and sentiments no less quaint and strange (if indeed not more so) than any of the actors of our poem. MARGITES was the name of this personage, whom Antiquity recordeth to have been <HI>Dunce the first;</HI> and surely from what we hear of him, not unworthy to be the root of so spreading a tree, and so numerous a posterity. The poem therefore celebrating him was pro∣perly and absolutely a <HI>Dunciad;</HI> which though now un∣happily lost, yet is its nature sufficiently known by the
<PB N="xliv" REF="49"/>
infallible tokens aforesaid. And thus it doth appear, that the first Dunciad was the first Epic poem, written by Homer himself, and anterior even to the Iliad or Odyssey.</P>
<P>Now, forasmuch as our poet had translated those two famous works of Homer which are yet left, he did con∣ceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost: And was therefore induced to bestow on it the same form which Homer's is reported to have had, namely that of Epic poem; with a title also framed after the ancient Greek manner, to wit, that of <HI>Dun∣ciad.</HI></P>
<P>Wonderful it is, that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some Dunciad! since, in the opinion of the multitude, it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic. But possible it is also, that, on due reflection, the maker might find it easier to paint a Charlemagne, a Brute, or a God∣frey, with just pomp and dignity heroic, than a Mar∣gites, a Codrus, or a Fleckno.</P>
<P>We shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our poet to this particular work. He lived in those days, when (after Providence had per∣mitted the invention of Printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned) Paper also became so cheap, and Printers so numerous, that a deluge of Authors cover∣ed the land: Whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested, but unmerciful demands were made of his applause, yea of his money, by such as would neither earn the one, nor deserve the other. At the same time, the licence of the Press was such, that it grew dangerous to refuse them either: for they would forthwith publish slanders unpunished, the authors being anonymous, and skulking under the wings of Publishers, a set of men who never scrupled to vend either Calumny or Blasphemy, as long as the Town would call for it.</P>
<P><PB N="xlv" REF="50"/>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vide Bossu, Du Poeme E∣pique, ch. viii.</NOTE> Now our author, living in those times, did con∣ceive it an endeavour well worthy an honest Satirist, to dissuade the dull, and punish the wicked, <HI>the only way that was left.</HI> In that public-spirited view he laid the plan of this Poem, as the greatest service he was capa∣ble (without much hurt, or being slain) to render his dear country. First, taking things from their original, he considereth the causes creative of such Authors, namely <HI>Dulness</HI> and <HI>Poverty;</HI> the one born with them, the other contracted by neglect of their proper talents, through self-conceit of greater abilities. This truth he wrappeth in an <HI>Allegory</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bossu, chap. vii.</NOTE> (as the construction of Epic poesy requireth) and feigns that one of these Goddesses had taken up her abode with the other, and that they jointly inspired all such writers and such works.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Book I. ℣ 32, &amp;c.</NOTE> He proceedeth to shew the <HI>qualities</HI> they bestow on these authors, and the <HI>effects</HI> they produce <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ver. 45 to 54.</NOTE>: then the <HI>mate∣rials,</HI> or <HI>stock,</HI> with which they furnish them <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ver. 57 to 77.</NOTE>; and (above all) that <HI>self-opinion</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ver. 80.</NOTE> which causeth it to seem to themselves vastly greater than it is, and is the prime motive of their setting up in this sad and sorry mer∣chandice. The great power of these Goddesses acting in alliance (whereof as the one is the mother of Indu∣stry, so is the other of Plodding) was to be exemplified in some <HI>one, great</HI> and <HI>remarkable Action</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap. vii, viii.</NOTE>: And none could be more so than that which our poet hath chosen, <HI>viz.</HI> the restoration of the reign of Chaos and Night, by the ministry of Dulness their daughter, in the re∣moval of her imperial seat from the City to the polite World; as the Action of the Aeneid is the restoration of the empire of Troy, by the removal of the race from thence to Latium. But as Homer singing only the <HI>Wrath</HI> of Achilles, yet includes in his poem the whole
<PB N="xlvi" REF="51"/>
history of the Trojan war; in like manner our author hath drawn into this <HI>single Action</HI> the whole history of Dulness and her children.</P>
<P>A <HI>Person</HI> must next be fixed upon to support this Action. This <HI>Phantom</HI> in the poet's mind must have a <HI>Name</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bossu, chap. viii. Vide Aristot Poetic. cap ix.</NOTE>: He finds it to be—; and he becomes of course the Hero of the poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fable</HI> being thus, according to the best exam∣ple, one and entire, as contained in the Proposition; the <HI>Machinery</HI> is a continued chain of Allegories, set∣ting forth the whole Power, Ministry, and Empire of Dulness, extended through her subordinate instruments, in all her various operations.</P>
<P>This is branched into <HI>Episodes,</HI> each of which hath its Moral apart, though all conducive to the main end. The Crowd assembled in the second book, demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad poets only, and that we may expect other Episodes of the Patrons, Encouragers, or Paymasters of such authors, as occa∣sion shall bring them forth. And the third book, if well considered, seemeth to embrace the whole World. Each of the Games relateth to some or other vile class of writers: The first concerneth the plagiary, to whom he giveth the name of More; the second the libellous Novellist, whom he styleth Eliza; the third, the flat∣tering Dedicator; the fourth, the bawling Critic, or noisy Poet; the fifth, the dark and dirty Party-writer; and so of the rest; assigning to each some <HI>proper name</HI> or other, such as he could find.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Characters,</HI> the public hath already ac∣knowledged how justly they are drawn: The manners are so depicted, and the sentiments so peculiar to those to whom applied, that surely to transfer them to any other or wiser personages, would be exceeding diffi∣cult: And certain it is, that every person concerned, being consulted apart, hath readily owned the resem∣blance
<PB N="xlvii" REF="52"/>
of every portrait, his own excepted. So Mr. Cibber calls them, <Q>“a parcel of <HI>poor wretches,</HI> so many <HI>silly flies</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Letter to Mr. P. pag. 9, 12, 41,</NOTE>: but adds, our Author's Wit is remarkably more bare and barren, whenever it would fall foul on <HI>Cibber,</HI> than upon any other Person whatever.”</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Descriptions</HI> are singular, the <HI>Comparisons</HI> very quaint, the <HI>Narration</HI> various, yet of one colour: The purity and chastity of <HI>Diction</HI> is so preserved, that in the places most suspicious, not the <HI>words</HI> but only the <HI>images</HI> have been censured, and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by ancient and clas∣sical Authority (though, as was the manner of those good times, not so curiously wrapped up) yea, and commented upon by the most grave Doctors, and ap∣proved Critics.</P>
<P>As it beareth the name of <HI>Epic,</HI> it is thereby sub∣jected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all Neoterics, a strict imitation of the Ancients; insomuch that any deviation, accompanied with whatever poetic beauties, hath always been censured by the sound Cri∣tic. How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece, appeareth not only by its general structure, but by par∣ticular allusions infinite, many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself; yea divers by his exceeding diligence are so altered and inter∣woven with the rest, that several have already been, and more will be, by the ignorant abused, as altogether and originally his own.</P>
<P>In a word, the whole poem proveth itself to be the work of our Author, when his faculties were in full vi∣gour and perfection; at that exact time when years have ripened the Judgment, without diminishing the Ima∣gination: which, by good Critics, is held to be punc∣tually at <HI>forty.</HI> For, at that season it was that Virgil finished his Georgics; and Sir Richard Blackmore at
<PB N="xlviii" REF="53"/>
the like age composing his Arthurs, declared the same to be the very <HI>Acme</HI> and pitch of life for Epic poesy: Though since he hath altered it to <HI>sixty,</HI> the year in which he published his Alfred <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See his Essays.</NOTE>. True it is, that the talents for <HI>Criticism,</HI> namely smartness, quick censure, vivacity of remark, certainty of asseveration, indeed all but acerbity, seem rather the gifts of Youth than of riper Age: But it is far otherwise in <HI>Poetry;</HI> witness the works of Mr. Rymer and Mr. Dennis, who begin∣ning with Criticism, became afterwards such Poets as no age hath paralleled. With good reason therefore did our author chuse to write his Essay on that subject at twenty, and reserve for his maturer years this great and wonderful work of the Dunciad. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>RICARDUS ARISTARCHUS OF THE HERO of the POEM.</HEAD>
<P>OF the Nature of <HI>Dunciad</HI> in general, whence derived, and on what authority founded, as well as of the art and conduct of this our poem in particular, the learned and laborious Scriblerus hath, according to his manner, and with tolerable share of judgment, dissertated. But when he cometh to speak of the <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>Hero</HI> fitted for such poem, in truth he miserably halts and hallucinates. For, misled by one Monsieur Bossu, a Gallic critic, he prateth of I cannot tell what Phantom of a Hero, only raised up to support the Fable. A putid conceit! As if Homer and Virgil, like modern Undertakers, who first build their house, and then seek out for a tenant, had contrived the story of a War and a Wandering, before they once thought either of Achilles or Aeneas. We shall therefore set our good brother and the world also right in this particular, by assuring them, that, in the greater Epic, the prime intention of the Muse is to exalt Heroic Virtue, in or∣der to propagate the love of it among the <HI>children</HI> of men; and consequently that the Poet's first thought must needs be turned upon a real subject meet for laud and celebration; not one whom he is to make, but one whom he may find, truly illustrious. This is the pri∣mum
<PB N="l" REF="55"/>
mobile of his poetic world, whence every thing is to receive life and motion. For this subject being found, he is immediately ordained, or rather acknowledged, an <HI>Hero,</HI> and put upon such action as befitteth the dignity of his character.</P>
<P>But the Muse ceaseth not here her Eagle-flight. For sometimes, satiated with the contemplation of these <HI>Suns</HI> of glory, she turneth downward on her wing, and darts with Jove's lightning on the <HI>Goose</HI> and <HI>Serpent</HI> kind. For we may apply to the Muse in her various moods, what an ancient master of Wisdom affirmeth of the Gods in general: <HI>Si Dii non irascuntur impiis et injustis, nec pios utique justosque diligunt. In rebus enim diversis, aut in utramque partem moveri necesse est, aut in neutram. Itaque qui bonos diligit, et malos odit; et qui malos non odit, nec bonos diligit. Quia et diligere bonos ex odio ma∣lorum venit; et malos odisse ex bonorum caritate descendit.</HI> Which in our vernacular idiom may be thus interpret∣ed: <Q>“If the Gods be not provoked at evil men, nei∣ther are they delighted with the good and just. For contrary objects must either excite contrary affections, or no affections at all. So that he who loveth good men, must at the same time hate the bad; and he who hateth not bad men, cannot love the good; because to love good men proceedeth from an aversion to evil, and to hate evil men from a tenderness to the good.”</Q> From this delicacy of the Muse arose the <HI>lit∣tle Epic,</HI> (more lively and choleric than her elder sister, whose bulk and complexion incline her to the flegmatic) and for this some notorious Vehicle of vice and folly was sought out, to make thereof an example. An ear∣ly instance of which (nor could it escape the accurate Scriblerus) the Father of Epic poem himself affordeth us. From him the practice descended to the Greek Dramatic poets, his offspring; who in the composition of their <HI>Tetralogy,</HI> or set of four pieces, were wont to make the last a <HI>Satiric Tragedy.</HI> Happily one of these
<PB N="li" REF="56"/>
ancient <HI>Dunciads</HI> (as we may well term it) is come down unto us amongst the Tragedies of the Poet Euripides. And what doth the reader suppose may be the subject thereof? Why in truth, and it is worthy observation, the unequal Contention of an <HI>old, dull, debauched buffoon Cy∣clops,</HI> with the heaven-directed <HI>Favourite of Minerva;</HI> who, after having quietly born all the monster's obscene and impious ribaldry, endeth the farce in punishing him with the mark of an indelible brand in his <HI>forehead.</HI> May we not then be excused, if for the future we consider the Epics of Homer, Virgil, and Milton, together with this our poem, as a complete <HI>Tetralogy,</HI> in which the last worthily holdeth the place or station of the <HI>satiric</HI> piece?</P>
<P>Proceed we therefore in our subject. It hath been long, and, alas for pity! still remaineth a question, whe∣ther the Hero of the <HI>greater Epic</HI> should be an <HI>honest man?</HI> or, as the French critics express it, <HI>un honnête homme</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Si un Heros Poëtique doit être un honnête homme. Bossu, du Poême Epique, lib. v. ch 5.</NOTE>: but it never admitted of any doubt, but that the Hero of the <HI>little Epic</HI> should be just the contrary. Hence, to the advantage of our Dunciad, we may ob∣serve how much juster the <HI>Moral</HI> of that Poem must needs be, where so important a question is previously decided.</P>
<P>But then it is not every Knave, nor (let me add) every Fool, that is a fit subject for a Dunciad. There must still exist some Analogy, if not Resemblance of Quali∣ties, between the Heroes of the two Poems; and this in order to admit what Neoteric critics call the <HI>Parody,</HI> one of the liveliest graces of the little Epic. Thus it being agreed, that the constituent qualities of the greater Epic Hero, are <HI>Wisdom, Bravery,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> from whence springeth <HI>heroic Virtue;</HI> it followeth, that those of the lesser Epic Hero, should be <HI>Vanity, Impudence,</HI> and <HI>De∣bauchery,</HI>
<PB N="lii" REF="57"/>
from which happy assemblage resulteth <HI>heroic Dulness,</HI> the never-dying subject of this our Poem.</P>
<P>This being confessed, come we now to particulars. It is the character of true <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to seek its chief sup∣port and confidence within itself; and to place that sup∣port in the resources which proceed from a conscious rectitude of Will. And are the advantages of <HI>Vanity,</HI> when arising to the heroic standard, at all short of this self-complacence? Nay, are they not, in the opinion of the enamoured owner, far beyond it? <Q>“Let the world (will such an one say) impute to me what folly or weakness they please; but till <HI>Wisdom</HI> can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be GAZED AT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dedication to the Life of C. C.</NOTE>.”</Q> This, we see, is <HI>Vanity</HI> according to the <HI>heroic</HI> gage or measure; not that low and ignoble species which pretendeth to <HI>Vir∣tues</HI> we <HI>have not,</HI> but the laudable ambition of being <HI>gazed at</HI> for glorying in those <HI>Vices,</HI> which every body knows <HI>we have.</HI> <Q>“The world may ask (says he) why I make my follies publick? Why not? I have passed my time very pleasantly with them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 2. octavo Ed.</NOTE>.”</Q> In short, there is no sort of Vanity such a Hero would scruple, but that which might go near to degrade him from his high sta∣tion in this our Dunciad; namely, <Q>“Whether it would not be <HI>Vanity</HI> in him, to take shame to himself for <HI>not being a wise man</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Life, ibid.</NOTE>?”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bravery,</HI> the second attribute of the true Hero, is Courage manifesting itself in every limb; while its cor∣respondent virtue in the mock Hero, is, that same Courage all collected into the <HI>Face.</HI> And as Power when drawn together, must needs have more force and spirit than when dispersed, we generally find this kind of courage in so high and heroic a degree, that it insults not only Men, but Gods. Mezentius is without doubt
<PB N="lii" REF="58"/>
the bravest character in all the Aeneis: But how? His bravery, we know, was an high courage of blasphemy. And can we say less of this brave man's, who having told us that he placed <Q>“his <HI>Summum bonum</HI> in those follies, which he was not content barely to possess but would likewise glory in, adds, <HI>If I am misguided,</HI> 'TIS NATURE'S FAULT, <HI>and I follow</HI> HER <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 23, octavo.</NOTE>.”</Q> Nor can we be mistaken in making this happy quality a spe∣cies of <HI>Courage,</HI> when we consider those illustrious marks of it, which made his FACE "more known (as he just∣ly boasteth) "than most in the kingdom," and his <HI>Lan∣guage</HI> to consist of what we must allow to be the most <HI>daring</HI> Figure of Speech, that which is taken from the <HI>Name of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentle Love,</HI> the next ingredient in the true Hero's composition, is a mere bird of passage, or as (Shake∣spear calls it) <HI>summer-teeming Lust,</HI> and evaporates in the heat of <HI>Youth;</HI> doubtless by that refinement it suffers in passing through those <HI>certain strainers</HI> which our Poet somewhere speaketh of. But when it is let alone to work upon the <HI>Lees,</HI> it acquireth strength by <HI>Old age;</HI> and becometh a lasting ornament to the little Epic. It is true indeed, there is one objection to its fitness for such an use: For not only the Ignorant may think it <HI>common,</HI> but it is admitted to be so, even by Him who best knoweth its value. <Q>“Don't you think (argueth he) to say only <HI>a man has his Whore</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Alluding to these lines in the Epist. to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<Q><L>"And has not Colly <HI>still</HI> his Lord and Whore,</L>
<L>"His Butchers Henly, his Free-Masons Moore?</L></Q></NOTE>, ought to go for little or nothing? Because <HI>defendit numerus,</HI> take the first ten thousand men you meet, and, I believe, you would be no loser if you betted ten to one, that every single sinner of them, one with another, had been guilty of the same frailty <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. P. p. 46.</NOTE>.”</Q> But here he seemeth not
<PB N="liv" REF="59"/>
to have done justice to himself: The man is sure enough a Hero, who hath his Lady at fourscore. How doth his Modesty herein lessen the merit of a <HI>whole well∣spent</HI> Life: not taking to himself the commendation (which <HI>Horace</HI> accounted the greatest in a theatrical cha∣racter) of continuing to the very <HI>dregs,</HI> the same he was from the beginning,
<Q><L>—Servetur ad <HI>IMUM</HI></L>
<L>Qualis ab incepto processerat—</L></Q></P>
<P>But here, in justice both to the Poet and the Hero, let us farther remark, that the calling her <HI>his</HI> whore, im∣plieth she was <HI>his own,</HI> and not his <HI>neighbour</HI>'s. Truly a commendable Continence! and such as Scipio himself must have applauded. For how much Self-denial was exerted not to covet his Neighbour's whore? and what disorders must the coveting her have occasioned in that Society, where (according to this Political Calculator) <HI>nine</HI> in <HI>ten</HI> of all ages have their <HI>concubines?</HI></P>
<P>We have now, as briefly as we could devise, gone through the three constituent Qualities of either Hero. But it is not in any, or in all of these, that Heroism pro∣perly or essentially resideth. It is a lucky result rather from the collision of these lively Qualities against one another. Thus, as from Wisdom, Bravery, and Love, ariseth <HI>Magnanimity,</HI> the object of <HI>Admiration,</HI> which is the aim of the greater Epic; so from Vanity, Impu∣dence, and Debauchery, springeth <HI>Buffoonry,</HI> the source of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> that "laughing ornament," as he well termeth it <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. P. p. 31.</NOTE>, of the little Epic.</P>
<P>He is not ashamed (God forbid he ever should be ashamed!) of this Character; who deemeth, that not <HI>Reason</HI> but <HI>Risibility</HI> distinguisheth the human species from the brutal. <Q>“As Nature (saith this profound Phi∣losopher) distinguished our species from the mute creation by our Risibility, her design MUST have been
<PB N="lv" REF="60"/>
by <HI>that faculty</HI> as evidently to raise our HAPPINESS, as by OUR <HI>os sublime</HI> (OUR ERECTED FACES) to lift the dignity of our FORM above them <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 23, 24</NOTE>.”</Q> All this considered, how complete a Hero must he be, as well as how happy a Man, whose Risibility lieth not barely in his <HI>muscles,</HI> as in the common sort, but (as himself in∣formeth us) in his very <HI>spirits?</HI> And whose <HI>Os sublime</HI> is not simply an <HI>erect face,</HI> but a brazen head, as should seem by his preferring it to one of Iron, said to belong to the late king of Sweden <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 8.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>But whatever personal qualities a Hero may have, the examples of Achilles and Aeneas shew us, that all those are of small avail, without the constant <HI>assistance of the</HI> GODS: for the subversion and erection of Empires have never been adjudged the work of Man. How great∣ly soever then we may esteem of his high talents, we can hardly conceive his personal prowess alone sufficient to restore the decayed empire of Dulness. So weigh∣ty an atchievement must require the particular favour and protection of the GREAT: who being the natural patrons and supporters of <HI>Letters,</HI> as the ancient Gods were of <HI>Troy,</HI> must first be drawn off and engaged in another Interest, before the total subversion of them can be accomplished. To surmount, therefore, this last and greatest difficulty, we have, in this excellent man, a professed Favourite and Intimado of the Great. And look, of what force ancient Piety was to draw the Gods into the party of Aeneas, that, and much stronger is modern Incense, to engage the Great in the party of Dulness.</P>
<P>Thus have we essayed to pourtray or shadow out this noble Imp of Fame. But now the impatient reader will be apt to say, if so many and various graces go to the making up a Hero, what mortal shall suffice to bear his character? Ill hath he read, who seeth not, in every
<PB N="xlvi" REF="61"/>
trace of this picture, that <HI>individual,</HI> ALL-ACCOM∣PLISHED PERSON, in whom these rare virtues and lucky circumstances have agreed to meet and concentre with the strongest lustre and fullest harmony.</P>
<P>The good Scriblerus indeed, nay the World itself might be imposed on in the late spurious editions, by I can't tell what <HI>Sham-Hero,</HI> or <HI>Phantom:</HI> But it was not so easy to impose on HIM whom this egregious error most of all concerned. For no sooner had the fourth book laid open the high and swelling scene, but he recognized his own heroic Acts: And when he came to the words,
<Q><L>Soft on her lap her Laureat son reclines,</L></Q>
(though <HI>Laureat</HI> imply no more than <HI>one crowned with laurel,</HI> as befitteth any Associate or Consort in Empire) he loudly resented this indignity to violated Majesty. Indeed not without cause, he being there represented as <HI>fast asleep;</HI> so misbeseeming the eye of Empire, which, like that of Providence, should never doze nor slumber. <Q>“Hah! (saith he) fast asleep, it seems! that's a little too strong. Pert and dull at least you might have al∣lowed me, but as seldom asleep as any fool<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 53.</NOTE>.”</Q> How∣ever, the injured Hero may comfort himself with this reflexion, that tho' it be a <HI>sleep,</HI> yet it is not the <HI>sleep of death,</HI> but of <HI>immortality.</HI> Here he will<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 1.</NOTE> <HI>live</HI> at least, tho' not <HI>awake;</HI> and in no worse condition than many an enchanted Warrior before him. The famous <HI>Duran∣darte,</HI> for instance, was, like him, cast into a long slum∣ber by <HI>Merlin</HI> the <HI>British Bard</HI> and Necromancer: and his example, for submitting to it with a good grace, might be of use to our Hero. For that disastrous knight being sorely pressed or driven to make his an∣swer by several <HI>persons of quality,</HI> only replied with a sigh, <HI>Patience, and shuffle the cards</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Don Quixote, Part ii. Book ii. ch. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="lvii" REF="62"/>
But now, as nothing in this world, no not the most sacred or perfect things either of Religion or Govern∣ment, can escape the sting of Envy, methinks I already hear these carpers objecting to the clearness of our Hero's title.</P>
<P>It would never (say they) have been esteemed suffi∣cient to make an Hero for the Iliad or Aeneis, that Achilles was brave enough to overturn one Empire, or Aeneas pious enough to raise another, had they not been Goddess-born, and Princes bred. What then did this Author mean, by erecting a Player instead of one of his Patrons, (a person "never a hero even on the stage <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Life, p. 148.</NOTE>,") to this dignity of Collegue in the empire of Dulness, and Atchiever of a work that neither old Omar, Attila, nor John of Leiden could entirely bring to pass.</P>
<P>To all this we have, as we conceive, a sufficient an∣swer from the Roman historian, <HI>Fabrum esse suae quemque fortunae: That every man is the</HI> Smith <HI>of his own fortune.</HI> The politic Florentine, Nicholas Machiavel, goeth still farther, and affirmeth that a man needeth but to <HI>believe him∣self a Hero</HI> to be one of the worthiest. <Q>“Let him (saith he) but fancy himself capable of the highest things, and he will of course be able to atchieve them.”</Q> From this principle it follows, that nothing can exceed our Hero's prowess; as nothing ever equalled the great∣ness of his conceptions. Hear how he constantly para∣gons himself; at one time to ALEXANDER the Great and CHARLES the XII. of SWEDEN, for the excess and delicacy of his Ambition <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 149.</NOTE>; to HENRY the IV. of FRANCE, for honest Policy <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 424.</NOTE>; to the first BRUTUS, for love of Liberty <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 366.</NOTE>; and to Sir ROBERT WALPOLE, for good Government while in power <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P. 457.</NOTE>: At another time, to the godlike SOCRATES, for his diversions and amuse∣ments <NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>; to HORACE, MONTAIGNE, and Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE, for an elegant Vanity that maketh them for

<P>Nothing therefore (we conceive) remaineth to hin∣der his own Prophecy of himself from taking immedi∣ate effect. A rare felicity! and what few prophets have had the satisfaction to see, alive!

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE DUNCIAD.] It is an inconvenience, to which Writers of reputation are subject, that the Justice of their resentment is not always rightly understood. For the calumnies of dull Authors being soon forgotten, and those whom they aimed to injure, not caring to recall to memory the particulars of false and scandalous abuse, their necessary correction is suspect∣ed of severity unprovoked. But, in this case, it would be but candid to estimate the chastisement on the general Character of the offender, compared with that of the Person injured. Let this serve with the candid Reader, in justification of the <HI>Poet;</HI> and, on occasion, of the <HI>Editor.</HI> <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>The DUNCIAD, sic MS. It may well be disputed whether this be a right reading: Ought it not rather to be spelled <HI>Dun∣ceiad,</HI> as the Etymology evidently demands? <HI>Dunce</HI> with an <HI>e,</HI> therefore <HI>Dunceiad</HI> with an <HI>e.</HI> That accurate and punctual Man of Letters, the Restorer of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> constantly ob∣serves the preservation of this very Letter <HI>e,</HI> in spelling the
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
Name of his beloved Author, and not like his common careless Editors, with the omission of one, nay sometimes of two <HI>ee's,</HI> (as <HI>Shakspear)</HI> which is utterly unpardonable. <Q>“”Nor is the neglect of a <HI>Single Letter</HI> so trivial as to some it may appear; the alteration whereof in a learned language is an Atchieve∣ment that brings honour to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. Bentley will be remembered to posterity for his perform∣ances of this sort, as long as the world shall have any esteem for the remains of Menander and Philemon.</Q> <BIBL>THEOBALD.</BIBL></P>
<P>This is surely a slip in the learned author of the foregoing note; there having been since produced by an accurate Anti∣quary, an <HI>Autograph</HI> of <HI>Shakspeare</HI> himself, whereby it appears that he spelled his own name without the first <HI>e.</HI> And upon this authority it was, that those most Critical Curators of his Monument in Westminster Abby erased the former wrong read∣ing, and restored the true spelling on a new piece of old Aegyp∣tian Granite. Nor for this only do they deserve our thanks, but for exhibiting on the same Monument the first Specimen of an <HI>Edition</HI> of an author in <HI>Marble;</HI> where (as may be seen on comparing the Tomb with the Book) in the space of five lines, two Words and a whole Verse are changed, and it is to be hoped will there stand, and outlast whatever hath been hither∣to done in Paper; as for the future, our Learned Sister Univer∣sity (the other Eye of England) is taking care to perpetuate a <HI>Total new Shakespear,</HI> at the Clarendon press. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></P>
<P>It is to be noted, that this great Critic also has omitted one circumstance; which is, that the Inscription with the Name of Shakspeare was intended to be placed on the Marble Scroll to which he points with his hand; instead of which it is now placed behind his back, and that Specimen of an Edition is put on the Scroll, which indeed Shakspeare hath great reason to point at. <BIBL>ANON.</BIBL></P>
<P>Though I have as just a value for the letter <HI>E,</HI> as any Gram∣marian living, and the same affection for the Name of this Poem as any Critic for that of his Author; yet cannot it induce me
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
to agree with those who would add yet another <HI>e</HI> to it, and call it the <HI>Dunceiade;</HI> which being a French and foreign termi∣nation, is no way proper to a word entirely English, and ver∣nacular. One <HI>e</HI> therefore in this case is right, and two <HI>e's</HI> wrong. Yet upon the whole I shall follow the Manuscript, and print it without any <HI>e</HI> at all; moved thereto by Authority (at all times, with Critics, equal, if not superior to Reason.) In which me∣thod of proceeding, I can never enough praise my good friend, the exact Mr. Tho. Hearne; who, if any word occur, which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong, yet keeps he it in the Text with due reverence, and only remarks in the Margin <HI>sic MS.</HI> In like manner we shall not amend this error in the Title itself, but only note it <HI>obiter,</HI> to evince to the learned that it was not our fault, nor any effect of our ignorance or inat∣tention. <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>This Poem was written in the year 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was published at Dublin, and reprinted at London in twelves; another at Dublin, and another at London in octavo; and three others in twelves the same year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in quarto; which was attended with Notes. We are willing to acquaint Posterity, that this Poem was presented to King George the Second and his Queen by the hands of Sir Robert Walpole, on the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of March, 1728-9. <BIBL>SCHOL. VET.</BIBL></P>
<P>It was expresly confessed in the Preface to the first edition, that this poem was not published by the Author himself. It was printed originally in a foreign Country. And what fo∣reign Country? Why, one notorious for blunders; where
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
finding blanks only instead of proper names, these blunderers filled them up at their pleasure.</P>
<P>The very <HI>Hero</HI> of the Poem hath been mistaken to this hour; so that we are obliged to open our Notes with a discovery who he really was. We learn from the former Editor; that this Piece was presented by the Hands of Sir Robert Walpole to King George II. Now the author directly tells us, his Hero is the Man
<Q><L>—who brings</L>
<L>The Smithfield Muses to the ear of Kings.</L></Q>
And it is notorious who was the person on whom this Prince conferred the honour of the <HI>Laurel.</HI></P>
<P>It appears as plainly from the <HI>Apostrophe</HI> to the <HI>Great</HI> in the third verse, that Tibbald could not be the person, who was never an Author in fashion, or caressed by the Great; whereas this single characteristic is sufficient to point out the true Hero; who, above all other Poets of his time, was the <HI>Peculiar De∣light</HI> and <HI>Chosen Companion</HI> of the Nobility of England; and wrote, as he himself tells us, certain of his Works at the <HI>earn∣est Desire of Persons of Quality.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, The sixth verse affords full proof; this Poet being the only one who was universally known to have had a <HI>Son</HI> so ex∣actly like him, in his poetical, theatrical, political, and moral Capacities, that it could justly be said of him
<Q><L>Still Dunce the second reign'd like Dunce the first. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>The Mighty Mother, and her Son,</HI> &amp;c.] The Reader ought here to be cautioned, that the <HI>Mother,</HI> and not the <HI>Son,</HI> is the principal Agent of this Poem: The latter of them is on∣ly chosen as her Collegue (as was anciently the custom in Rome before some great Expedition) the main action of the Poem be∣ing by no means the Coronation of the Laureate, which is per∣formed in the very first book, but the Restoration of the Em∣pire of Dulness in Britain, which is not accomplished till the last. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>Ibid.—<HI>her Son who brings,</HI> &amp;c.] Wonderful is the stupidity of all the former Critics and Commentators on this work! It breaks
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
forth at the very first line. The author of the Critique prefixed to <HI>Sawney,</HI> a Poem, p. 5. hath been so dull as to explain <HI>the Man who brings,</HI> &amp;c. not of the hero of the piece, but of our Poet himself, as if he vaunted that <HI>Kings</HI> were to be his readers; an honour, which though this Poem hath had, yet knoweth he how to receive it with more modesty.</P>
<P>We remit this Ignorant to the first lines of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> assur∣ing him that <HI>Virgil</HI> there speaketh not of himself, but of <HI>Ae∣neas:</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris</L>
<L>Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit</L>
<L>Littora: multum ille et terris jactatus et alto, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>I cite the whole three verses, that I may by the way offer a <HI>Conjectural Emendation,</HI> purely my own, upon each: First, <HI>ori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> should be read <HI>aris,</HI> it being, as we see <HI>Aen.</HI> ii. 513. from the <HI>altar</HI> of <HI>Jupiter Hercaeus</HI> that <HI>Aeneas</HI> fled as soon as he saw <HI>Priam</HI> slain. In the second line I would read <HI>flatu</HI> for <HI>fato,</HI> since it is most clear it was by <HI>Winds</HI> that he arrived at the <HI>shore</HI> of Italy. <HI>Jactatus,</HI> in the third, is surely as improperly appli∣ed to <HI>terris,</HI> as proper to <HI>alto;</HI> to say a man is <HI>tost on land,</HI> is much at one with saying <HI>he walks at sea: Risum teneatis, amici?</HI> Correct it, as I doubt not it ought to be, <HI>vexatus.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>The Smithfield Muses] Smithfield</HI> is the place where Bartholomew Fair was kept, whose shews, machines, and dra∣matical entertainments, formerly agreeable only to the taste of the Rabble, were, by the Hero of this poem and others of equal genius, brought to the Theatres of Covent-garden, Lincolns-inn-fields, and the Hay-market, to be the reigning pleasures of the Court and Town. This happened in the Reigns of King George I, and II. See Book iii.</P>

<P><PB N="70" REF="75"/>
VER. 12. <HI>Daughter of Chaos</HI> &amp;c.] The beauty of this whole Allegory being purely of the poetical kind, we think it not our proper business, as a Scholiast, to meddle with it: But leave it (as we shall in general all such) to the reader; remarking only that <HI>Chaos</HI> (according to <HI>Hesiod</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) was the Progenitor of all the Gods. <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 15. <HI>Laborious, heavy, busy, bold,</HI> &amp;c.] I wonder the learned Scriblerus has omitted to advertise the Reader, at the opening of this Poem, that Dulness here is not be taken con∣tractedly for mere Stupidity, but in the enlarged sense of the word, for all Slowness of Apprehension, shortness of Sight, or imperfect Sense of things. It includes (as we see by the Poet's own words) Labour, Industry, and some degree of Activity and Boldness: a ruling principle not inert, but turning topsy▪ turvy the Understanding, and inducing an Anarchy or confused State of Mind. This remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work; and without this caution he will be apt to mistake the Importance of many of the Characters, as well as of the Design of the Poet. Hence it is, that some have complained he chuses too mean a subject, and imagined he em∣ploys himself, like Domitian, in killing flies; whereas those who have the true key will find he sports with nobler quarry, and embraces a larger compass; or (as one saith, on a like oc∣casion)
<Q><L>Will see his Work, like Jacob's ladder, rise,</L>
<L>Its foot in dirt, its head amid the skies. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 16. <HI>She rul'd, in native Anarchy, the mind.] The na∣tive Anarchy of the mind</HI> is that state which procedes the time of Reason's assuming the rule of the Passions. But in that state,

the uncontrolled violence of the Passions would soon bring things to confusion, were it not for the intervention of DULNESS in this absence of Reason; who, though she cannot regulate them like Reason, yet blunts and deadens their Vigour, and, indeed, produces some of the good effects of it: Hence it is that <HI>Dulness</HI> has often the appearance of Reason. This is the only good she ever did; and the Poet takes particular care to tell it in the very intro∣duction of his Poem.

Mr. Oldmixon, in his Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, p. 413, 414. affirms, <Q>“That of all the Galimatia▪s he ever met with, none comes up to some verses of this poet, which have as much of the Ridiculum and the Fustian in them as can well be jumbled together, and are of that sort of nonsense, which so perfectly confounds all ideas, that there is no distinct one left in the mind." Farther he says of him, "That he hath prophecied his own poetry shall be sweeter than Catullus, Ovid, and Tibullus; but we have little hope of the accom∣plishment of it, from what he hath lately published.”</Q> Upon which Mr. Oldmixon has not spared a reflection, <Q>“That the putting the Laurel on the head of one who writ such verses, will give futurity a very lively idea of the judgment and justice of those who bestowed it.”</Q> Ibid. p. 417. But the well-known learning of that Noble Person, who was then Lord Chamber∣lain, might have screened him from this unmannerly reflection. Nor ought Mr. Oldmixon to complain, so long after, that the Laurel would have better become his own brows, or any others: It were more decent to acquiesce in the opinion of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> upon this matter:</P>

<P>It would be unjust not to add his reasons for this Fury, they are so strong and so coercive: <Q>“I regard him (saith he) as an <HI>Enemy,</HI> not so much to me, as to my King, to my Country, to my Religion, and to that Liberty which has been the sole felicity of my life. A vagary of Fortune, who is sometimes pleased to be frolicksome, and the epidemic <HI>Madness of the times</HI> have given him <HI>Reputation,</HI> and Repu∣tation (as Hobbes says) is <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>that has made him dan∣gerous.</HI> Therefore I look on it as my duty to <HI>King George,</HI> whose faithful subject I am; to my <HI>Country,</HI> of which I have appeared a constant lover; to the <HI>Laws,</HI> under whose pro∣tection I have so long lived; and to the <HI>Liberty</HI> of my <HI>Coun∣try,</HI> more dear to me than life, of which I have now for forty years been a constant assertor, &amp;c.

Pref. p. 2. 91, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Besides these public-spirited reasons, Mr. D. had a private one; which, by his manner of expressing it in p. 92. appears to have been equally strong. He was even in bodily fear of his life from the machinations of the said Mr. P. "The story (says▪
<Q><PB N="88" REF="95"/>
“he) is too long to be told, but who would be acquainted with it, may hear it from Mr. Curl, my bookseller.—However, what my reason has suggested to me, that I have with a just confidence said, in defiance of his two clandestine wea∣pons, his <HI>Slander</HI> and his <HI>Poison.”</HI></Q> Which last words of his book plainly discover Mr. D.'s suspicion was that of being <HI>poi∣soned,</HI> in like manner as Mr. Curl had been before him: of which fact see <HI>A full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge, by poison, on the body of Edmund Curl,</HI> printed in 1716, the year antecedent to that wherein these Remarks of Mr. Dennis were published. But what puts it beyond all question, is a passage in a very warm treatise, in which Mr. D. was also concerned, price two pence, called <HI>A true character of Mr. Pope and his writings,</HI> printed for S. Popping, 1716; in the tenth page whereof he is said <Q>“to have insulted people on those calamities and diseases which he himself gave them, by ad∣ministring <HI>Poison</HI> to them;”</Q> and is called (p. 4.) <Q>“a Jurk∣ing way-laying coward, and a stabber in the dark.”</Q> Which (with many other things most lively set forth in that piece) must have rendered him a terror, not to Mr. Dennis only, but to all christian people. This charitable warning only provoked our incorrigible Poet to write the following Epigram:</P>
<LG>
<L>Should Dennis publish, you had stabb'd your Brother,</L>
<L>Lampoon'd your Monarch, or debauch'd your Mother;</L>
<L>Say, what revenge on Dennis can be had?</L>
<L>Too dull for laughter, for reply too mad:</L>
<L>On one so poor you cannot take the Law;</L>
<L>On one so old your sword you scorn to draw:</L>

<L>Secure in dulness, madness, want, and age.</L>
</LG>
<P>For the rest; Mr. John Dennis was the son of a Sadler in London, born in 1657. He paid court to Mr. Dryden: and having obtained some correspondence with Mr. Wycherly and Mr. Congreve, he immediately obliged the public with their Letters. He made himself known to the Government by many admirable schemes and projects; which the Ministry, for reasons
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
best known to themselves, constantly kept private. For his character, as a writer, it is given us as follows: <Q>“Mr. Dennis is <HI>excellent</HI> at Pindaric writings, <HI>perfectly regular</HI> in all his per∣formances, and a person of <HI>sound Learning.</HI> That he is ma∣ster of a great deal of <HI>Penetration</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> his criti∣cisms (particularly on <HI>Prince Arthur)</HI> do sufficiently demon∣strate.”</Q> From the same account it also appears that he writ Plays "more to get <HI>Reputation</HI> than <HI>Money."</HI> DENNIS of himself.

<P>VER. 109. <HI>Bays, form'd by Nature,</HI> &amp;c.] It is hoped the poet here hath done full justice to his Hero's character, which it were a great mistake to imagine was wholly sunk in stupidi∣ty: he is allowed to have supported it with a wonderful mix∣ture of Vivacity. This character is heightened according to his own desire, in a Letter he wrote to our author. <Q>“Pert and dull at least you might have allowed me. What! am I only to be dull, and dull still, and again, and for ever?”</Q> He then solemnly appealed to his own conscience, that <Q>“he could not think himself so, nor believe that our poet did; but that he spoke worse of him than he could possibly think; and con∣cluded it must be merely to shew his <HI>Wit,</HI> or for some <HI>Profit</HI> or <HI>Lucre</HI> to himself.”</Q> Life of C.

In truth a great absurdity! Not that we are ignorant that the Hero of Homer's Odyssey is fre∣quently in that circumstance, and therefore it can no way de∣rogate from the grandeur of Epic Poem to represent such Hero under a calamity, to which the greatest, not only of Critics and Poets, but of Kings and Warriors, have been subject. But much more refined, I will venture to say, is the meaning of our au∣thor: It was to give us, obliquely, a curious precept, or, what Bossu calls, <HI>a disguised sentence,</HI> that <Q>“Temperance is the life of Study.”</Q> The language of poesy brings all into action; and to represent a Critic encompassed with books but without a sup∣per, is a picture which lively expresseth how much the true Cri∣tic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body, one of which he always castigates, and often totally neglects for the greater improvement of the other. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>

<P>Our Author manifests here, and elsewhere, a prodigious ten∣derness for the <HI>bad writers.</HI> We see he selects the only good passage, perhaps, in all that ever Ogilby writ; which shews how candid and patient a reader he must have been. What can be more kind and affectionate than these words in the pre∣face to his Poems, where he labours to call up all our huma∣nity and forgiveness toward these unlucky men, by the most moderate representation of their case that has ever been given by any author? <Q>“Much may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets: What we call a <HI>genius</HI> is hard to be distinguish∣ed, by a man himself, from a prevalent inclination: And if it be never so great, he can at first discover it no other way than by that strong propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. He has no other method but to make the experiment, by writing, and so appealing to the judg∣ment of others: And if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no sin in itself) he is immediately made the object of ridicule! I wish we had the humanity to reflect, that even the worst authors might endeavour to please us, and, in that en∣deavour, deserve something at our hands. We have no cause to quarrel with them, but for their obstinacy in persisting, and even that may admit of alleviating circumstances: For their particular friends may be either ignorant, or unsincere; and the rest of the world too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of.”</Q></P>

<P>The King being proclaimed, the solemnity is graced with public <HI>Games</HI> and sports of various kinds; not institut∣ed by the Hero, as by Aeneas in Virgil, but for greater honour by the <HI>Goddess</HI> in person (in like manner as the games Pythia, Isthmia, &amp;c. were anciently said to be ordained by the Gods, and as Thetis herself appearing, according to Homer, Odyss. <HI>xxiv.</HI> proposed the prizes in honour of her son Achilles.) Hither flock the Poets and Critics, attended, as is but just, with their Patrons and Booksellers. The Goddess is first pleased, for her dis∣port, to propose games to the <HI>Booksellers,</HI> and setteth up the Phantom of a Poet, which they contend to over∣take. The Races described, with their divers accidents. Next, the game for a <HI>Poetess.</HI> Then follow the Exer∣cises for the <HI>Poets,</HI> of <HI>tickling, vociferating, diving:</HI> The first holds forth the arts and practices of <HI>Dedica∣tors,</HI> the second of <HI>Disputants</HI> and <HI>fustian Poets,</HI> the

third of <HI>prosound, dark,</HI> and <HI>dirty Party-writers.</HI> Lastly, for the <HI>Critics,</HI> the Goddess proposes (with great propriety) an Exercise, not of their parts, but their patience, in hearing the works of two voluminous Au∣thors, one in <HI>verse,</HI> and the other in <HI>prose,</HI> deliberate∣ly read, without sleeping: The various effects of which, with the several degrees and manners of their operation, are here set forth; 'till the whole number, not of Cri∣tics only, but of spectators, actors, and all present, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fast asleep; which naturally and necessarily ends the games.</P>

There in his seat two spacious vents appear,</L>

<L>In office here fair Cloacina stands,</L>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>TWO things there are, upon the supposition of which the very basis of all verbal criticism is founded and supported: The first, that an Author could never fail to use the <HI>best word</HI> on every occasion; the second, that a Critic cannot chuse but know <HI>which that is.</HI> This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, first, that the author could <HI>never have used it;</HI> and, secondly, that he must have used <HI>that very one,</HI> which we conjecture in its stead.</P>
<P>We cannot, therefore, enough admire the learned Scriblerus for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the pre∣ceding book, which in all the former editions stood thus:
<Q><L>Hoarse thunder to its bottom shook the bog,</L>
<L>And the loud nation croak'd, God save king Log.</L></Q>
He has, with great judgment, transposed these two epithets; put∣ting <HI>hoarse</HI> to the nation, and <HI>loud</HI> to the thunder: And this being evidently the true reading, he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former; for which assertion of the just right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all sound Commenta∣tors.</P>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>Henley's gilt tub,]</HI> The pulpit of a Dissenter is usually called a Tub; but that of Mr. Orator Henley was co∣vered with velvet, and adorned with gold. He had also a fair altar, and over it is this extraordinary inscription, <HI>The Primi∣tive Eucharist.</HI> See the history of this person, book iii.</P>

Ibid. <HI>or Fleckno's Irish throne,]</HI> Richard Fleckno was an Irish priest, but had laid aside (as himself expressed it) the mechanic part of priesthood. He printed some plays, poems, letters, and travels. I doubt not our author took occasion to mention him in respect to the Poem of Mr. Dryden, to which this bears some resemblance, though of a character more different from it than that of the Aeneid from the Iliad, or the Lutrin of Boileau from the Defait de Bouts rimées of Sarazin.</P>

<P>VER. 3. <HI>Or that where on her Curls the Public pours,]</HI> Ed∣mund Curl stood in the pillory at Charing-cross, in March 1727-8. <Q>“This (saith Edmund Curl) is a false Assertion—I had indeed the corporal punishment of what the Gentlemen of the long Robe are pleased jocosely to call <HI>mounting the Rostrum</HI> for one hour: but that scene of Action was not in the month of <HI>March,</HI> but in <HI>February.”</HI></Q> <HI>[Curliad,</HI> 12<SUP>mo</SUP> <HI>p.</HI> 19.] And of <HI>the History of his being tost in a Blanket,</HI> he saith, "Here, <HI>Scriblerus!</HI> thou leeseth in what thou assertest con∣cerning

<P>We should think (gentle Reader) that we but ill performed our Part, if we corrected not as well <HI>our own Errors</HI> now, as formerly those of the <HI>Printer.</HI> Since what moved us to this Work, was solely the Love of <HI>Truth,</HI> not in the least any Vain∣glory, or Desire to contend with <HI>Great Authors.</HI> And further, our Mistakes, we conceive, will the rather be pardoned, as scarce possible to be avoided in writing of such Persons and Works as do ever shun the Light. However, that we may not any way soften or extenuate the same, we give them thee in the very Words of our Antagonists: not desending, but retracting them from our heart, and craving excuse of the Parties offended: For farely in this Work, it hath been above all things our desire, <HI>to provoke no Man.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>

which Leo X. gave to poets, travelled to Rome with a harp in his hand, and sung to it twenty thousand verses of a poem called Alexias. He was introduced <HI>as a Buffoon</HI> to Leo, and promoted to the honour of the <HI>Laurel;</HI> a jest which the court of Rome and the Pope himself entered into so far, as to cause him to ride on an elephant to the Capitol, and to hold a solemn festi∣val on his coronation; at which it is recorded the Poet himself was so transported as to <HI>weep for joy</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Life of C.

VER. 47. <HI>Never was dash'd out, at one lucky hit,]</HI> Our author here seems willing to give some account of the possibility of <HI>Dulness</HI> making a Wit (which could be done no other way than by <HI>chance.)</HI> The fiction is the more reconciled to probabi∣lity, by the known story of Apelles, who being at a loss to ex∣press the foam of Alexander's horse, dashed his pencil in de∣spair at the picture, and happened to do it by that fortunate stroke.</P>
<P>VER. 50. <HI>and call'd the phantom More.]</HI> CURL, in his key to the Dunciad, affirmed this to be James-More Smith esq. and it is probable (considering what is said of him in the <HI>Testimonies)</HI> that some might fancy our author obliged to represent this gen∣tleman as a plagiary, or to pass for one himself. His case in∣deed was like that of a man I have heard of, who, as he was sitting in company, perceived his next neighbour had stolen his handkerchief. <Q>“Sir, (said the thief, finding himself detected) do not expose me, I did it for mere want; be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again, and say nothing.”</Q> The honest man did so, but the other cry'd out, <Q>“See, gentle∣men, what a thief we have among us! look, he is stealing my handkerchief!”</Q></P>
<P>Some time before, he had borrowed of Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot</HI> a pa∣per call'd an Historico-physical account of the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> the Memoirs of a Parish Clark, which for two years he kept, and read to the Rev Dr. <HI>Young,—F. Bill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> Esq. and many others, as his own. Being applied to for them,
<PB N="127" REF="137"/>
he pretended they were lost; but there happening to be another copy of the latter, it came out in <HI>Swift</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Miscella∣nies. Upon this, it seems he was so far mistaken as to confess his proceeding by an endeavour to hide it: unguardedly printing (in the <HI>Daily Journal</HI> of <HI>Apr.</HI> 3. 1728.) "That the contempt "which he and others had for those pieces (which only him∣self had shown, and handed about as his own) "occasion'd "their being lost, and for that cause only not return'd." A fact, of which as none but he could be conscious, none but he could be the publisher of it. The plagiarisms of this person gave occasion to the following Epigram:</P>
<LG>
<L>"More always smiles whenever he recites;</L>
<L>"He smiles (you think) approving what he writes.</L>
<L>"And yet in this no vanity is shown;</L>
<L>"A modest man may like what's not his own.</L>
</LG>
<P>This young Gentleman's whole misfortune was too inordinate a passion to be thought a Wit. Here is a very strong instance attested by Mr. <HI>Savage</HI> son of the late Earl <HI>Rivers;</HI> who hav∣ing shown some verses of his in manuscript to Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> where∣in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was call'd <HI>first of the tuneful train,</HI> Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> the next morning sent to Mr. <HI>Savage</HI> to desire him to give those verses another turn, to wit, <Q>“That <HI>Pope</HI> might now be the <HI>first,</HI> because <HI>Moore</HI> had left him unrival'd in turning his style to Comedy.”</Q> This was during the rehearsal of the <HI>Rival Modes,</HI> his first and only work; the Town condemn'd it in the action, but he printed it in 1726-7, with this modest Motto,
<Q><L>Hic caestus, artemque repono.</L></Q>
The smaller pieces which we have heard attributed to this author, are, An Epigram on the Bridge at <HI>Blenheim,</HI> by Dr. <HI>Evans: Cosmelia,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Pit,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> &amp;c. The Mock-marriage of

<P>Notwithstanding what is here collected of the Person imagin'd by <HI>Curl</HI> to be meant in this place, we cannot be of that opi∣nion; since our Poet had certainly no need of vindicating half a dozen verses to himself, which every reader had done for him; since the name itself is not spell'd <HI>Moore,</HI> but <HI>More;</HI> and last∣ly, since the learned <HI>Scriblerus</HI> has so well prov'd the contrary.</P>

<P>VER. 53. <HI>But lofty Lintot]</HI> We enter here upon the episode of the Booksellers: Persons, whose names being more known and famous in the learned world than those of the Authors in this poem, do therefore need less explanation. The action of Mr. Lintot here imitates that of Dares in Virgil, rising just in this manner to lay hold on a <HI>Bull.</HI> This eminent Bookseller printed the <HI>Rival Modes</HI> before-mentioned.</P>
<P>VER. 58. <HI>Stood dauntless Curl;]</HI> We come now to a cha∣racter of much respect, that of Mr. Edmund Curl. As a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them, we shall only say of this eminent man, that he carried the Trade ma∣ny lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at; and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession. He pos∣sessed
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
himself of a command over all authors whatever; he caused them to write what he pleased; they could not call their very <HI>Names</HI> their own. He was not only famous among these; he was taken notice of by the <HI>State,</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Law,</HI> and received particular marks of distinction from each.</P>
<P>It will be owned that he is here introduced with all possible dignity: He speaks like the intrepid Diomed; he runs like the swift-footed Achilles; if he falls, 'tis like the beloved Nisus; and (what Homer makes to be the chief of all praises) he is <HI>fa∣voured of the Gods;</HI> he says but three words, and his prayer is heard; a Goddess conveys it to the seat of Jupiter: Though he loses the prize, he gains the victory; the great Mother her∣self comforts him, she inspires him with expedients, she honours him with an immortal present (such as Achilles receives from Thetis, and Aeneas from Venus) at once instructive and pro∣phetical: After this he is unrivalled and triumphant.</P>
<P>The tribute our author here pays him is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations: Many weighty animadversions on the public affairs, and many excellent and diverting pieces on private persons, has he given to his name. If ever he owed two verses to any other, he owed Mr. Curl some thousands. He was every day extending his fame, and enlarging his Writings: Witness innumerable instances; but it shall suffice only to men∣tion the <HI>Court Poems,</HI> which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer, a Lady of quality; but being first threatened, and afterwards punished for it by Mr. Pope, he generously trans∣ferred it from <HI>her</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> and ever since printed it in his name. The single time that ever he spoke to C. was on that affair, and to that happy incident he owed all the favours since received from him: So true is the saying of Dr. Sydenham, <Q>“that any one shall be, at some time or other, the better or the worse, for having but <HI>seen</HI> or <HI>spoken</HI> to a good or bad man.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="141" MS="y"/>
VER. 70. <HI>Curl's Corinna]</HI> This name, it seems, was taken by one Mrs. T—, who procured some private letters of Mr. Pope, while almost a boy, to Mr. Cromwell, and sold them without the consent of either of those Gentlemen to Curl, who printed them in 12mo, 1727.

He has in this very poem celebrated Mr. Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Barrow, Dr. Atterbury, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Congreve, Dr. Garth, Mr. Addison; in a word, almost every man of his time that deserved it; even Cibber himself (presum∣ing him to be author of the Careless Husband.) It was very diffi∣cult to have that pleasure in a poem on this subject, yet he has
<PB N="138" REF="150"/>
found means to insert their panegyric, and has made even Dulness out of her own mouth pronounce it. It must have been particularly agreeable to him to celebrate Dr. Garth; both as his constant friend, and as he was his predecessor in this kind of satire. The Dispensary attacked the whole body of Apo∣thecaries, a much more useful one undoubtedly than that of the bad Poets; if in truth this can be a body, of which no two members ever agreed. It also did, what Mr. Theobald says is unpardonable, drew in <HI>parts</HI> of <HI>private character,</HI> and introduced <HI>persons independent of his subject.</HI> Much more would Boileau have incurred his censure, who left all subjects whatever, on all occasions, to fall upon the bad poets (which, it is to be feared, would have been more immediately his concern.) But certainly next to commending good writers, the greatest ser∣vice to learning is to expose the bad, who can only that way be made of any use to it.

and whose indefatigable Muse produced no less than six Epic poems: Prince and King Arthur, twenty books; Eliza, ten; Alfred, twelve; the Redeemer, six; besides Job, in folio; the whole Book of Psalms; the Creation, seven books; Nature of Man, three books; and many more.

<P>In his Essay on Criticism, and the Arts of Logic and Rheto∣ric, he frequently reflects on our Author. But the top of his character was a Perverter of History, in that scandalous one of the Stuarts, in folio, and his Critical History of England, two volumes, octavo. Being employed by bishop Kennet, in pub∣lishing the Historians in his Collection, he falsified Daniel's Chronicle in numberless places. Yet this very man, in the pre∣face to the first of these books, advanced a <HI>particular fact</HI> to charge three eminent persons of falsifying the lord Clarendon's History; which fact has been disproved by Dr. Atterbury, late bishop of Rochester, then the only survivor of them; and the particular part he pretended to be falsified, produced since, af∣ter almost ninety years, in that noble author's original manu∣script.

The authors were the same obscure men; though sometimes relieved by occasional essays from States∣men, Courtiers, Bishops, Deans, and Doctors. The meaner sort were rewarded with Money; others with Places or Bene∣fices, from an hundred to a thousand a year. It appears from the <HI>Report</HI> of the <HI>Secret Committee</HI> for enquiring into the Con∣duct of R.

<P>After the other persons are disposed in their proper places of rest, the Goddess transports the King to her Temple, and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap; a position of marvellous virtue, which causes all the Vi∣sions of wild enthusiasts, projectors, politicians, inamo∣ratos, castle-builders, chemists, and poets.

There he is met by the ghost of <HI>Settle,</HI> and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place, and with those which he himself is destined to perform. He takes him to a <HI>Mount of Vision,</HI> from whence he shews him the past triumphs of the Empire of Dulness, then the present, and lastly the future: how small a part of the world was ever conquered by Science, how soon those conquests were stopped,

and those very nations again reduced to her dominion. Then distinguishing the Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> shews by what aids, by what persons, and by what degrees it shall be brought to her Empire. Some of the persons he causes to pass in review before his eyes, describing each by his proper figure, character, and qualifications. On a sud∣den the Scene shifts, and a vast number of miracles and prodigies appear, utterly surprising and unknown to the King himself, 'till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing. On this subject <HI>Settle</HI> breaks into a congratulation, yet not unmixed with concern, that his own times were but the types of these. He prophesies how first the nation shall be over-run with <HI>Farces, Operas,</HI> and <HI>Shows;</HI> how the throne of Dul∣ness shall be advanced over the <HI>Theatres,</HI> and set up even at <HI>Court:</HI> then how her Sons shall preside in the seats of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences:</HI> giving a glimpse, or Pisgah-sight of the future Fulness of her Glory, the accomplishment whereof is the subject of the fourth and last book.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 5, 6, &amp;c. Hereby is intimated that the following Vi∣sion is no more than the chimera of the dreamer's brain, and not a real or intended satire on the present Age, doubtless more learned, more enlightened, and more abounding with great Genius's in Divinity, Politics, and whatever arts and sciences, than all the preceding. For fear of any such mistake of our Poet's honest meaning, he hath again, at the end of the Vision, repeated this monition, saying that it all pass'd through the <HI>Ivory gate,</HI> which (according to the Ancients) denoteth Falsity. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>How much the good Scriblerus was mistaken, may be seen from the fourth book, which, it is plain from hence, he had never seen. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="192" MS="y"/>
VER. 15. <HI>A slip-shod Sibyl]</HI> This allegory is extremely just, no conformation of the mind so much subjecting it to real <HI>Mad∣ness,</HI> as that which produces real <HI>Dulness.</HI> Hence we find the religious (as well as the poetical) Enthusiasts of all ages were ever, in their natural state, most heavy and lumpish; but on the least application of <HI>heat,</HI> they run like lead, which of all metals falls quickest into fusion. Whereas <HI>fire</HI> in a Genius is truly Promethean, it hurts not its constituent parts, but only fits it (as it does well-tempered steel) for the necessary impres∣sions of art. But the common people have been taught (I do not know on what foundation) to regard Lunacy as a mark of <HI>Wit,</HI> just as the Turks and our modern Methodists do of <HI>Ho∣liness.</HI> But if the cause of Madness assigned by a great Philo∣sopher be true, it will unavoidably fall upon the dunces. He supposes it to be the <HI>dwelling over long on one object or idea:</HI> Now as this attention is occasioned either by Grief or Study, it will be fixed by Dulness; which hath not quickness enough to comprehend what it seeks, nor force and vigour enough to divert the imagination from the object it laments. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>

VER. 19. <HI>Taylor]</HI> John Taylor the Water-poet, an honest man, who owns he learned not so much as the Accidence: A rare example of modesty in a Poet!</P>

<L>I must confess I do want eloquence,</L>
<L>And never scarce did learn my Accidence;</L>

<P>He wrote fourscore books in the reign of James I. and Charles I. and asterwards (like Edward Ward) kept an Ale-house in Long-Acre. He died in 1654.</P>
<P>VER. 21. <HI>Benlowes,]</HI> A country gentleman, famous for his own bad Poetry, and for patronizing bad Poets, as may be seen from many Dedications of Quarles and others to him. Some of these anagram'd his name, <HI>Benlowes</HI> into <HI>Benevolus:</HI> to veri∣fy which, he spent his whole estate upon them.</P>
<P>VER. 22. <HI>And Shadwell nods the Poppy</HI> &amp;c.] Shadwell took Opium for many years, and died of too large a dose, in the year 1692.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="194"/>
VER. 24. <HI>Old Bavius sits,]</HI> Bavius was an ancient Poet, celebrated by Virgil for the like cause as Bays by our author, though not in so christian-like a manner: For heathenishly it is declared by Virgil of Bavius, that he ought to be <HI>hated</HI> and <HI>detested</HI> for his evil works; <HI>Qui Bavium non</HI> odit; whereas we have often had occasion to observe our Poet's great <HI>Good Nature</HI> and <HI>Mercifulness</HI> thro' the whole course of this Poem. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>Mr. Dennis warmly contends, that Bavius was no inconsi∣derable author; nay, that <Q>“He and Maevius had (even in Augustus's days) a very formidable party at Rome, who thought them much superior to Virgil and Horace: For (saith he) I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit.”</Q> Rem. on Pr. Arthur, part ii. c. 1. An argument which, if this poem should last, will conduce to the honour of the gentlemen of the Dunciad.</P>
<P>VER. 28. <HI>Brown and Mears]</HI> Booksellers, Printers for any body.—The allegory of the souls of the dull coming forth in the form of books, dressed in calf's leather, and being let abroad in vast numbers by Booksellers, is sufficiently intelligible.</P>

Mr. Curl (having likewise stood there) looks upon the mention of such a Gentleman in a satire, as a <HI>great act of barbarity,</HI> Key to the Dunc. 3d edit. p. 16. And another author reasons thus upon it. Durgen. 8vo. p. 11, 12. <Q>“How unworthy is it of <HI>Christian Charity</HI> to animate the <HI>rab∣ble</HI> to abuse a <HI>worthy man</HI> in such a situation? What could move the Poet thus to mention a <HI>brave sufferer,</HI> a <HI>gallant prisoner,</HI> exposed to the view of all mankind! It was laying aside his <HI>Senses,</HI> it was committing a <HI>Crime,</HI> for which the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>deficient</HI> not to punish him! nay, a Crime which <HI>Man can scarce forgive,</HI> or <HI>Time efface!</HI> Nothing surely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great Lady, &amp;c.”</Q> (to whom this brave, honest, worthy Gentleman was guilty of no offence but Forgery, proved in open Court.)

here: I believe I may say the same of the Critics; Dennis, Oldmixon, Welsted have passed it in silence. I have also stum∣bled at it, and wondered how an error so manifest could escape such accurate persons. I dare assert it proceeded originally from the inadvertency of some Transcriber, whose head ran on the <HI>Pillory,</HI> mentioned two lines before; it is therefore amazing that Mr. Curl himself should over look it! Yet that <HI>Scholiast</HI> takes not the least notice hereof. That the learned Mist also read it thus, is plain from his ranging this passage among those in which our author was blamed for <HI>personal Satire</HI> on a <HI>Man's face</HI> (whereof doubtless he might take the <HI>ear</HI> to be a part;) so likewise Concannen, Ralph, the Flying Post, and all the herd of Commentators.—<HI>Tota armenta sequuntur.</HI></P>

At length they spared some of the Temples, by converting them to Churches; and some of the Statues, by modifying them into images of Saints. In much later times, it was thought neces∣sary to change the statues of Apollo and Pallas, on the tomb of Sannazarius, into David and Judith; the Lyre easily became a Harp, and the Gorgon's head turned to that of Holofernes.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Welsted</HI> had, in his youth, raised so great expectations of his future genius, that there was a <HI>kind of struggle</HI> between the most eminent in the two Universities, which should have the <HI>honour</HI> of his education.

<P>VER. 173. <HI>Ah Dennis! Gildon ah!]</HI> These Men became the public scorn by a mere mistake of their talents. They would needs turn critics of their own country writers (just as Aristo∣tle and Longinus did of theirs) and discourse upon the beauties and defects of composition:
<Q><L>How parts relate to parts, and they to whole;</L>
<L>The Body's harmony, the beaming soul.</L></Q>
Whereas had they followed the Example of those <HI>microscopes of wit,</HI> Kuster, Burman, and their followers, in verbal criticism on the learned languages, their acuteness and industry might have raised them a name equal to the most famous of the Scho∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts.

<P>Here, Scriblerus, in this affair of the FIRE-SIDE, I want thy usual candour. It is true Mr. Upton did write notes upon it, but with all honour and good faith.

VER. 173. <HI>Ah Dennis,</HI> &amp;c.] The reader, who has seen thro' the course of these notes, what a constant attendance Mr. Den∣nis paid to our Author and all his works, may perhaps wonder he should be mention'd but twice, and so slightly touch'd, in this poem. But in truth he look'd upon him with some esteem, for having (more generously than all the rest) <HI>set his Name</HI> to such writings. He was also a very old man at this time. By his own account of himself in Mr. <HI>Jacob's Lives,</HI> he must have been above threescore, and happily lived many years after.

<P>Of the other works of these Gentlemen the world has heard no more, than it would of Mr. <HI>Pope's,</HI> had their united laud∣able endeavours discourag'd him from pursuing his studies.

champions to stifle them in their conception? And were it not better for the publick, that a million of monsters should come into the world, which are sure to die as soon as born, than that the serpents should strangle one <HI>Hercules</HI> in his Cradle?

<P>After many Editions of this poem, the Author thought fit to omit the names of these two persons, whose injury to him was of so old a date. In the verses he omitted, it was said that one of them had a <HI>pious passion</HI> for the other. It was a literal translation of <HI>Virgil, Nisus amore pio pueri</HI>—and there, as in the original, applied to Friendship: That between <HI>Nisus</HI> and <HI>Eu∣ryalus</HI> is allowed to make one of the most amiable Episodes in the world, and surely was never interpreted in a perverse sense. But it will astonish the reader to hear, that, on no other occasion than this line, a Dedication was written to that Gentleman to in∣duce him to think something further. <Q>“Sir, you are known to have all that affection for the beautiful part of the crea∣tion which God and Nature desiga'd.—Sir, you have a very fine Lady—and, Sir, you have eight very fine Children,”</Q>—&amp;c. <HI>[Dedic. to</HI> Dennis <HI>Rem. on the Rape of the Lock.]</HI> The truth is, the poor Dedicator's brain was turn'd upon this arti∣cle: He had taken into his head, that ever since some books were written against the <HI>Stage,</HI> and since the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> had prevail'd, the nation was infected with a vice not fit to be

Where∣upon the Lords met in a committee to appoint some other place to sit in, while the house should be taken down. But it be∣ing proposed to cause some other builders first to inspect it, they found it in very good condition. The Lords, upon this, were going upon an address to the King against Benson, for such a mis∣representation; but the Earl of Sunderland, then secretary, gave them an assurance that his Majesty would remove him, which was done accordingly. In favour of this man, the famous Sir Christopher Wren, who had been Architect to the crown for above fifty years, who built most of the Churches in London, laid the first stone of St. Paul's, and lived to finish it, had been displaced from his employment at the age of near ninety years.</P>

His constant cry was, that Mr. P. was an <HI>Enemy to the government;</HI> and in particular he was the avowed author of a report very industriously spread, that he had a hand in a party-paper call'd the <HI>Examiner:</HI> A falshood well known to those yet living, who had the direction and publication of it.</P>

The portico of Covent-garden church had been just then restor'd and beautified at the expence of the Earl of Burlington; who, at the same time, by his publication of the designs of that great Master and Palladio, as well as by many noble buildings of his own, revived the true taste of Architecture in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>VER. 330. <HI>Gay dies unpension'd,</HI> &amp;c.] See Mr. Gay's fable of the <HI>Hare and many Friends.</HI> This gentleman was early in the friendship of our author, which continued to his death. He wrote several works of humour with great success, the Shep∣herd's Week, Trivia, the What-d'ye-call-it, Fables; and last∣ly, the celebrated Beggar's Opera; a piece of satire which hit all tastes and degrees of men, from those of the highest quality to the very rabble: That verse of Horace
<Q><L>Primores populi arripuit, populumque tributim,</L></Q>
<PB N="219" REF="234" MS="y"/>
could never be so justly applied as to this. The vast success of it was unprecedented, and almost incredible: What is related of the wonderful effects of the ancient music or tragedy hardly came up to it: Sophocles and Euripides were less followed and famous. It was acted in London sixty-three days, uninterrupt∣ed; and renew'd the next season with equal applauses. It spread into all the great towns of England, was play'd in many places to the thirtieth and fortieth time, at Bath and Bristol fifty, &amp;c. It made its progress into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where it was performed twenty four days together: It was last acted in Minorca. The fame of it was not confined to the author only; the ladies carried about with them the favourite songs of it in fans; and houses were furnished with it in screens. The per∣son who acted Polly, till then obscure, became all at once the favourite of the town; her pictures were engraved, and sold in great numbers; her life written, books of letters and verses to her, published;
and pamphlets made even of her sayings and jests.</P>

The Edition of Shakespear (which he undertook merely because no body else would) took up near two years more in the drudgery of comparing impressions, rec∣tifying the Scenery, &amp;c. and the Translation of half the Odys∣sey employed him from that time to 1725.</P>

Remember what the Dutch stories somewhere relate, that a great part of their Provinces was once overflowed, by a small opening made in one of their dykes by a single <HI>Water-Rat.</HI></P>
<P>However, that such is not seriously the judgement of our Poet, but that he conceiveth better hopes from the Diligence of our Schools, from the Regularity of our Universities, the Discern∣ment of our Great men, the Accomplishments of our Nobility, the Encouragement of our Patrons, and the Genius of our Writers in all kinds (notwithstanding some few exceptions in

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Poet being, in this Book, to declare the <HI>Completion</HI> of the <HI>Prophecies</HI> mention'd at the end of the former, makes a new <HI>Invocation;</HI> as the greater Poets are wont, when some high and worthy matter is to be sung. He shews the Goddess coming in her Majesty, to destroy <HI>Or∣der</HI> and <HI>Science,</HI> and to substitute the <HI>Kingdom of the Dull</HI> upon earth. How she leads captive the <HI>Sciences,</HI> and silenceth the <HI>Muses;</HI> and <HI>what</HI> they be who suc∣ceed in their stead. All her Children, by a wonderful attraction, are drawn about her; and bear along with them divers others, who promote her Empire by conni∣vance, weak resistance, or discouragement of Arts; such as Half-wits, tasteless Admirers, vain Pretenders, the Flatterers of Dunces, or the Patrons of them. All these crowd round her; one of them offering to approach her, is driven back by a Rival, but she commends and encou∣rages both. The first who speak in form are the <HI>Ge∣nius's</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="238"/>
of the <HI>Schools,</HI> who assure her of their care to advance her Cause, by confining Youth to <HI>Words,</HI> and keeping them out of the way of real Knowledge. Their Address, and her gracious Answer; with her Charge to them and the Universities. The <HI>Universities</HI> appear by their proper Deputies, and assure her that the same method is observ'd in the progress of <HI>Education.</HI> The speech of <HI>Aristarchus</HI> on this subject. They are driven off by a band of young Gentlemen return'd from <HI>Travel</HI> with their <HI>Tutors;</HI> one of whom delivers to the Goddess, in a polite oration, an account of the whole Conduct and Fruits of their <HI>Travels:</HI> presenting to her at the same time a young Nobleman perfectly accomplish∣ed. She receives him graciously, and indues him with the happy quality of <HI>Want of Shame.</HI> She sees loitering about her a number of <HI>Indolent Persons</HI> abandoning all business and duty, and dying with laziness: To these approaches the Antiquary <HI>Annius,</HI> intreating her to make them <HI>Virtuosos,</HI> and assign them over to him: But <HI>Mummius,</HI> another Antiquary, complaining of his frau∣dulent proceeding, she finds a method to reconcile their difference. Then enter a Troop of people fantastically adorn'd, offering her strange and exotic presents: Amongst them, one stands forth and demands justice on another, who had deprived him of one of the greatest Curiosities in nature: but he justifies himself so well, that the Goddess gives them both her approbation. She re∣commends to them to find proper employment for the <HI>In∣dolents</HI> before-mentioned, in the study of <HI>Butter-flies, Shells, Birds-nests, Moss,</HI> &amp;c. but with particular caution, not to proceed beyond <HI>Trifles,</HI> to any useful or extensive views of Nature, or of the Author of Nature. Against the last of these apprehensions, she is secured by a hearty Address from the <HI>Minute Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Freethinkers,</HI> one of whom speaks in the name of the rest. The Youth thus instructed and principled, are de∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered to her in a body, by the hands of <HI>Silenus;</HI> and

<P>The DUNCIAD, Book IV.] This Book may properly be di∣stinguished from the former, by the Name of the GREATER DUNCIAD, not so indeed in Size, but in Subject; and so far contrary to the distinction anciently made of the <HI>Greater</HI> and <HI>Lesser Iliad.</HI> But much are they mistaken who imagine this Work in any wise inferior to the former, or of any other hand than of our Poet; of which I am much more certain than that the <HI>Iliad</HI> itself was the Work of <HI>Solomon,</HI> or the <HI>Batrachomuo∣machia</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> as <HI>Barnes</HI> hath affirmed. <BIBL>BENT.

<P>VER. 1, &amp;c.] This is an Invocation of much Piety. The Poet willing to approve himself a genuine Son, beginneth by shewing (what is ever agreeable to <HI>Dulness)</HI> his high respect for <HI>Antiquity</HI> and a <HI>Great Family,</HI> how dead or dark soever: Next declareth his passion for explaining Mysteries; and lasty his Im∣patience to be <HI>re-united</HI> to her. <BIBL>SCRIBL.

<P>I understand it very differently; the Author in this work had indeed a <HI>deep Intent;</HI> there were in it <HI>Mysteries</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which he durst not fully reveal, and doubtless in divers verses (according to <HI>Milton)</HI>

VER. 6. <HI>To whom Time bears me on his rapid wing,]</HI> Fair and softly, good Poet! (cries the gentle <HI>Scriblerus</HI> on this place.) For sure in spite of his unusual modesty, he shall not travel so fast toward Oblivion, as divers others of more Confidence have done: For when I revolve in my mind the Catalogue of those who have the most boldly promised to themselves Immortality, <HI>viz. Pindar, Luis Gongora, Ronsard, Oldham,</HI> Lyrics; <HI>Lyco∣phron, Statius, Chapman, Blackmore,</HI> Heroics; I find the one half to be already dead, and the other in utter darkness. But it becometh not us, who have taken up the office of his Com∣mentator, to suffer our Poet thus prodigally to cast away his Life; contrariwise, the more hidden and abstruse is his work, and the more remote its beauties from common Understanding, the more is it our duty to draw forth and exalt the same, in the face of Men and Angels. Herein shall we imitate the laudable Spirit of those, who have (for this very reason) delighted to comment on <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>uncouth</HI> Authors, and even on their <HI>darker</HI> Fragments; preferred <HI>Ennius</HI> to <HI>Virgil,</HI> and chosen to turn the dark Lanthorn of LYCOPHRON, rather than to trim the everlasting Lamp of <HI>Homer.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.

<P>VER. 11, 12. <HI>Sick was the Sun,—The moon-struck Prophet]</HI> The poet introduceth this (as all great events are supposed by sage Historians to be preceded) by an <HI>Eclipse of the Sun;</HI> but with a peculiar propriety, as the Sun is the <HI>Emblem</HI> of that in∣tellectual light which dies before the face of Dulness.

VER. 20. <HI>her Laureat son reclines.]</HI> With great judgment i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is imagined by the Poet, that such a Collegue as Dulness had elected, should sleep on the Throne, and have very little share in the Action of the Poem. Accordingly he hath done little or nothing from the day of his Anointing; having past through the second book without taking part in any thing that was trans∣acted about him; and thro' the third in profound Sleep. Nor ought this, well considered, to seem strange in our days, when so many <HI>King-consorts</HI> have done the like. <BIBL>SCRIBL. P. W.</BIBL></P>
<P>This verse our excellent Laureat took so to heart, that he appealed to all mankind, <Q>“if he was not as <HI>seldom asleep as any fool?”</HI></Q> But it is hoped the Poet hath not injured him, but rather verified his Prophecy (p. 243. of his own Life, 8vo. ch. ix.) where he says <Q><HI>“the Reader will be as much pleased to find me a</HI> Dunce <HI>in my</HI> Old Age, <HI>as he was to prove me a</HI> brisk blockhead <HI>in my</HI> Youth.”</Q> Wherever there was any room for Briskness, or Alacrity of any sort, <HI>even in sinking,</HI> he hath had it allowed; but here, where there is nothing for him to do but to take his natural rest, he must permit his Historian to be silent. It is from their <HI>actions</HI> only that Princes have their character, and Poets from their <HI>works:</HI> And if in <HI>those</HI> he be <HI>as much asleep as any fool,</HI> the Poet must leave him and them to <HI>sleep to all eternity.</HI> <BIBL>BENT. P.</BIBL></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>her Laureat]</HI> <Q>“When I find my Name in the satirical works of this Poet, I never look upon it as any malice meant to me, but PROFIT to himself. For he considers that <HI>my Face</HI> is more <HI>known</HI> than most in the nation; and there∣fore <HI>a Lick at the Laureate</HI> will be a sure bait <HI>ad captandum vulgus,</HI> to catch little readers.”</Q> Life of Colley Cibber, ch. ii.</P>
<P>Now if it be certain, that the works of our Poet have owed their success to this ingenious expedient, we hence derive an unanswerable Argument, that this Fourth DUNCIAD, as well as the former three, hath had the Author's last hand, and was by him intended for the Press: Or else to what purpose hath he crowned it, as we see, by this finishing stroke, the profitable <HI>Lick at the Laureate?</HI> <BIBL>BENT.

VER. 39. <HI>But sober</HI> History] History attends on Tragedy, Satire on Comedy, as their substitutes in the discharge of their distinct functions; the one in high life, recording the crimes and punishments of the great; the other in low, exposing the vices or follies of the common people. But it may be asked, How came <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Satire</HI> to be admitted with impunity to minister comfort to the Muses, even in the presence of the God∣dess, and in the midst of all her triumphs? A question, says <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> which we thus resolve: <HI>History</HI> was brought up in her infancy by Dulness herself; but being afterwards espoused into a noble house, she forgot (as is usual) the humility of her birth, and the cares of her early friends. This occasioned a long estrangement between her and Dulness. At length, in process of time, they met together in a Monk's Cell, were reconciled, and became better friends than ever.

<P>For while no rewards are given for the encouragement of Letters, Genius will support itself on the footing of that reputa∣tion, which men of wit will always win from the Dunces.

For, as the course of things is ordered, general reputa∣tion, when it comes into rivalship, is rather attendant on favour and high station, than on the simple endowments of Wit and Learning. Hence we conclude that unless the Province of en∣couraging Letters be wisely and faithfully administered, it were better for them that there were no encouragements at all. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>

<P>VER. 175. <HI>Oh (cry'd the Goddess)</HI> &amp;c.] The matter under debate is how to confine men to Words for life. The instruc∣tors of youth shew how well they do their parts; but complain that when men come into the world they are apt to forget their Learning, and turn themselves to useful Knowledge. This was an evil that wanted to be redressed. And this the Goddess assures them will need a more extensive Tyranny than that of Gram∣mar schools. She therefore points out to them the remedy, in her wishes for <HI>arbitrary Power;</HI> whose interest it being to keep men from the study of <HI>things,</HI> will encourage the propagation of <HI>words</HI> and <HI>sounds;</HI> and, to make all sure, she wishes for an∣other <HI>Pedant Monarch.</HI> The sooner to obtain so great a blessing, she is willing even for once to violate the fundamental principle of her politics, in having her sons taught at least <HI>one thing;</HI> but that sufficient, the <HI>Doctrine of Divine Right.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing can be juster than the observation here insinuated, that no branch of Learning thrives well under Arbitrary go∣vernment but <HI>Verbal.</HI> The reasons are evident. It is unsafe under such Governments to cultivate the study of things of im∣portance. Besides, when men have lost their public virtue, they naturally delight in trifles, if their private morals secure them from being vicious. Hence so great a Cloud of Scholiasts and Grammarians so soon overspread the Learning of Greece and Rome, when once those famous Communities had lost their
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
Liberties. Another reason is the <HI>encouragement</HI> which arbitrary governments give to the study of <HI>words,</HI> in order to busy and amuse active genius's, who might otherwise prove troublesome and inquisitive. So when Cardinal Richelieu had destroyed the poor remains of his Country's liberties, and made the supreme Court of Parliament merely <HI>ministerial,</HI> he instituted the <HI>French Academy.</HI> What was said upon that occasion, by a brave Ma∣gistrate, when the letters-patent of its erection came to be veri∣fied in the Parliament of Paris, deserves to be remembered: He told the assembly, that <HI>this adventure put him in mind after what manner an Emperor of Rome once treated his Senate; who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen he had deprived them of the cognizance of Public matters, sent a message to them in form for their opinion about the best Sauce for a Turbot.</HI> <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>

<Q><L>nunquam <HI>Libertas</HI> gratior exstat</L>
<L><HI>Quam sub</HI> Rege pio</L></Q>
But this I will say, that the words <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Monarchy</HI> have been frequently confounded and mistaken one for the other by the gravest authors. I should therefore conjecture, that the genuine reading of the sorecited verse was thus,
<Q><L>nunquam <HI>Libertas</HI> gratior exstat</L>
<L>Quam sub <HI>Lege</HI> pia</L></Q>
and that <HI>Rege</HI> was the reading only of Dulness herself: And therefore she might allude to it. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>I judge quite otherwise of this passage: The genuine reading is <HI>Libertas,</HI> and <HI>Rege:</HI> So Claudian gave it. But the error lies in the first verse: It should be <HI>exit,</HI> not <HI>exstat,</HI> and then the meaning will be, that Liberty was never <HI>lost,</HI> or <HI>went away</HI> with so good a grace, as under a good King: it being without doubt a tenfold shame to lose it under a bad one.</P>
<P>This farther leads me to animadvert upon a most grievous piece of nonsense to be found in all the Editions of the Author of the Dunciad himself.

For with the <HI>better sort of fool</HI> the first expedient is, ℣ 254 to 258, to run him so swiftly through the circle of the Sciences that he shall stick at nothing, nor nothing stick with him; and though some little, both of words and things, should by chance be ga∣thered up in his passage, yet he shews, ℣ 259 to 261, that it is never more of the one than just to enable him to <HI>persecute with Rhyme,</HI> or of the other than to <HI>plague with Dispute.</HI> But, if after all, the Pupil will needs <HI>learn</HI> a Science, it is then provided by his careful directors, ℣ 261, 262, that it shall ei∣ther be such as he can never <HI>enjoy</HI> when he comes out into life, or such as he will be obliged to <HI>divorce.</HI> And to make all sure, ℣ 263 to 267, the useless or pernicious Sciences, thus taught, are still applied perversely; the man of Wit <HI>petrified</HI> in Euclid, or <HI>trammelled</HI> in Metaphysics; and the man of Judg∣ment <HI>married,</HI> without his parents consent, to a <HI>Muse.</HI> Thus far the particular arts of modern Education, used partially, and diversified according to the Subject and the Occasion: But there is one general Method, with the encomium of which the great Aristarchus ends his speech, ℣ 267 to 270, and that is AUTHO∣RITY, the universal CEMENT, which fills all the cracks and chasms of <HI>lifeless</HI> matter, shuts up all the pores of <HI>living</HI> sub∣stance, and brings all human minds to <HI>one dead level.</HI> For if Nature should chance to struggle through all the entanglements of the foregoing ingenious expedients to <HI>bind rebel wit,</HI> this claps upon her one sure and entire cover.

What relation have these to the transformation of Hares into Larks, or of Pigeons into Toads? I shall tell thee. The Laestrygons spitted Men upon Spears, as we do Larks upon Skewers: and the fair Pigeon turn'd to a Toad is similar to the fair Virgin Scylla ending in a filthy beast. But here is the difficulty, why Pigeons in so shocking a shape should be brought to a Table. Hares indeed might be cut into Larks at a second dressing, out of frugality: Yet that seems no probable motive, when we consider the extravagance before-mentioned, of dissolving whole Oxen and Boars into a small vial of Jolly; nay it is expresly said, that <HI>all Flesh is no∣thing in his sight.</HI> I have searched in Apicius, Pliny, and the Feast of Trimalchio, in vain: I can only resolve it into some myste∣rious superstitious Rite, as it is said to be done by a <HI>Priest,</HI> and soon after called a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> attended (as all ancient sacrifices were) with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Song.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>

We should be unjust to the reign of <HI>Dulness</HI> not to consess that her's has one advantage in it rarely to be met with in Modern Governments, which is, that the public <HI>Education</HI> of her Youth fits and prepares them for the observance of her <HI>Laws,</HI> and the exertion of those <HI>Virtues</HI> she recommends. For what makes men <HI>prouder</HI> than the empty <HI>knowledge of Words;</HI> what more <HI>selfish</HI> than the Free-thinker's <HI>System of Morals;</HI> or duller than the profession of true <HI>Virtuosoship?</HI> Nor are her <HI>Institutions</HI> less admirable in themselves, than in the fitness of these their several relations, to promote the harmony of the whole. For she tells her Sons, and with great truth, that <Q>“all her commands are <HI>easy, short,</HI> and <HI>full.”</HI></Q> For is any thing in nature more <HI>easy</HI> than the exertion of <HI>Pride;</HI> more <HI>short</HI> and <HI>simple</HI> than the prin∣ciple of <HI>Selfishness;</HI> or more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>ample</HI> than the sphere of <HI>Dulness?</HI> Thus, Birth, Education, and wise Policy, all con∣curring to support the throne of our Goddess, great must be the strength thereof. <BIBL>SCRIBL.

<P>But if it be well consider'd, that whatever inclination they might have to do mischief, her sons are generally render'd harm∣less by their Inability; and that it is the common effect of Dul∣ness (even in her greatest efforts) to defeat her own design; the Poet, I am persuaded, will be justified, and it will be allowed

<DIV2>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Prefixed to the five first imperfect Editions of the DUNCIAD, in three books, printed at DUBLIN and LONDON, in octavo and duode∣cimo, 1727.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PUBLISHER<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Publisher]</HI> Who he was a uncertain; but Edward Ward tells us, in his preface to Durgen, <Q>“that most judges are of opi∣nion this preface is not of English extraction, but Hiber∣nian,”</Q> &amp;c, He means it was written by Dr. Swift, who, whe∣ther publisher or not, may be said in a sort to be author of the poem For when he, together with Mr. Pope (for reasons spe∣cified in the preface to their Mis∣cellanies) determined to own the most trifling pieces in which they had any hand, and to de∣stroy all that remained in their power; the first sketch of this poem was snatched from the fire by Dr. Swift, who persuaded his friend to proceed in it, and to him it was therefore inscribed. But the occasion of printing it was as follows:</NOTE> to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT will found a true observation, tho' somewhat surprizing, that when any scandal is vented against a man of the high∣est distinction and character, either in the state or in litera∣ture, the public in general afford it a most quiet reception; and the larger part accept it as favourably as if it were some kind∣ness done to themselves: whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touch'd upon, a whole legion is up a arms, and it becomes the common cause of all scriblers, bookfellers, and printers whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="320"/>
Not to search too deeply into the reason hereof, I will only observe as a fact, that every week for these two months past, the town has been persecuted with<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>pamphlets, advertisements,</HI> &amp;c.] See the List of those ano∣nymous papers, with their dates and authors annexed, inserted be∣fore the Poem.</NOTE> pamphlets, advertisements, letters, and weekly essays, not only against the wit and writ∣tings, but against the character and person of Mr. Pope. And that of all those men who have received pleasure from his works, which by modest computation may be about a<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>about a hundred thousand]</HI> It is surprizing with what stupidity this preface, which is almost a continued irony, was taken by those authors. All such passages as these were understood by Curl, Cook, Cibber, and others, to be serious. Hear the Laureate (Let∣ter to Mr. Pope, p. 9) <Q>“Tho' I grant the Dunciad a better poem of its kind than ever was writ; yet, when I read it with those <HI>vain-glorious</HI> en∣cumbrances of Notes and Re∣marks upon it, &amp;c.—it is amazing, that you, who have writ with such masterly spirit upon the ruling Passion, should be so blind a slave to your own, as not to see how far a <HI>low avarice of Praise,”</HI></Q> &amp;c. (taking it for granted that the notes of Scribleras and others, were the author's own.)</NOTE> hundred thou∣sand in these kingdoms of England and Ireland; (not to men∣tion Jersey, Guernsey, the Orcades, those in the new world,
<PB N="307" REF="321"/>
and foreigners who have translated him into their languages) of all this number not a man hath stood up to say one word in his defence.</P>
<P>The only exception is the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>The author of the following poem,</HI> &amp;c.] A very plain irony, speaking of Mr. Pope himself.</NOTE> author of the following poem, who doubtless had either a better insight into the grounds of this clamour, or a better opinion of Mr. Pope's integrity, join'd with a greater personal love for him, than any other of his nu∣merous friends and admirers.</P>
<P>Farther, that he was in his peculiar intimacy, appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him, and from his having in this poem attacked<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The publisher in these words went a little too sar; But it is certain, whatever names the rea∣der finds that are unknown to him, are of such; and the excep∣tion is only of two or three, whose dulness, impudent scurri∣lity, or self-conceit, all mankind agreed to have justly entitled them to a place in the Dunciad.</NOTE> no man living, who had not before printed, or pub∣lished, some scandal against this gentleman.</P>
<P>How I came possest of it, is no concern to the reader; but it would have been a wrong to him had I detain'd the publica∣tion; since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast, as must render it too soon unintelligible. If it pro∣voke the author to give us a more perfect edition, I have my end.</P>
<P>Who he is I cannot say, and (which is a great pity) there is certainly<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>there is certainly nothing in his style,</HI> &amp;c.] This irony had small effect in concealing the author. The Dunciad, imper∣fect as it was, had not been pub∣lished two days, but the whole Town gave it to Mr. Pope.</NOTE> nothing in his style and manner of writing, which can distinguish or discover him: For if it bears any resemblance to that of Mr. Pope, 'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose, with a view to have it pass for his. But by the frequency of his allusions to Virgil, and a labour'd (not to say affected) <HI>shortness</HI> in imitation of him, I should think him more an admirer of the Roman poet than of the Grecian, and in that not of the same taste with his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="322" MS="y"/>
I have been well inform'd, that this work was the labour of full <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>the labour of full six years,</HI> &amp;c.) This also was honestly and seriously believed by divers gen∣tlemen of the Dunciad. J. Ralph, pref. to Sawney. <Q>“We are told it was the labour of six years, with the utmost assiduity and application: It is no great compliment to the author's sense, to have employed so large a part of his life,”</Q> &amp;c. So also Ward, pref. to Durgen, <Q>“The Dunciad, as the publisher very wisely confesses, cost the author six years retirement from all the pleasures of life; though it is somewhat diffi∣cult to conceive, from either its bulk or beauty, that it could be so long in hatching, &amp;c. But the length of time and closeness of application were mentioned to prepossess the reader with a good opini∣on of it.”</Q></P>
<P>They just as well understood what Scriblerus said of the Poem.</P></NOTE> six years of his life, and that he wholly retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world, to attend diligently to its correction and perfection; and six years more he intended to bestow upon it, as it should seem by this verse of Statius, which was cited at the head of his manuscript,
<Q><L>Oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos,</L>
<L>Duncia <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The prefacer to Curl's Key, p. 3. took this word to be really in Statius: <Q>“By a quibble on the word <HI>Duncia,</HI> the <HI>Dunciad</HI> is formed,”</Q> Mr. Ward also fol∣lows him in the same opinion.</NOTE>!</L></Q></P>
<P>Hence also we learn the true title of the poem; which with the same certainty as we call that of Homer the Iliad, of Vir∣gil the Aeneid, of Camoens the Lusiad, we may pronounce, could have been, and can be no other than</P>

<HEAD>The DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<P>It is styled <HI>Heroic,</HI> as being <HI>doubly</HI> so; not only with respect to its nature, which, according to the best rules of the ancients, and strictest ideas of the moderns, is critically such; but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer, who dar'd to stir up such a formidable, irritable, and implacable race of mortals.</P>
<P>There may arise some obscurity in chronology from the <HI>Names</HI> in the poem, by the inevitable removal of some authors, and insertion of others, in their niches. For whoever will consi∣der the unity of the whole design, will be sensible, that the <HI>poem was not made for these authors, but these authors for the</HI>
<PB N="309" REF="323"/>
<HI>poem.</HI> I should judge that they were clapp'd in as they rose, fresh and fresh, and chang'd from day to day; in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thrust new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; since when he shall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the persons than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as they are, than to change them for fictitious names; by which the satire would only be multiplied, and applied to many instead of one. Had the hero, for instance, been called Codrus, how many would have affirm'd him to have been Mr. T. Mr. E. Sir R. B. &amp;c. but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him by a name, which by good luck happens to be that of a real person.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the FIRST EDITION with Notes, in Quarto, 1729.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be sufficient to say of this edition, that the reader has here a much more correct and complete copy of the DUNCIAD, than has hitherto appear'd. I cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipt into it, but a vast number of others will be prevented by the names being now not only set at length, but justified by the authorities and reasons given. I make no doubt, the author's own motive to use real rather than feign'd names, was his care to preserve the innocent from any false application; whereas in the former editions, which had no more than the initial letters, he was made, by keys printed here, to hurt the inoffensive; and (what was worse) to abuse his friends, by an impression at Dublin.</P>
<P>The commentary which attends this poem was sent me from several hands, and consequently must be unequally written; yet will have one advantage over most commentaries, that it is not made upon conjectures, or at a remote distance of time: And the reader cannot but derive one pleasure from the very <HI>Ob∣scurity</HI> of the persons it treats of, that it partakes of the nature of a <HI>Secret,</HI> which most people love to be let into, tho' the men or the things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Persons</HI> it was judg'd proper to give some account: For since it is only in this monument that they must expect to survive (and here survive they will, as long as the English tongue sshall remain such as it was in the reigns of Queen ANNE and king GEORGE,) it seem'd but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each, just to tell what he was, what he writ, when he liv'd, and when he died.</P>
<P>If a word or two more are added upon the chief offenders, 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the breast, to mark the enor∣mities for which they suffer'd; lest the correction only should be remember'd, and the crime forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="329"/>
In some articles it was thought sufficient, barely to transcribe from Jacob, Curl, and other writers of their own rank, who were much better acquainted with them than any of the authors of this comment can pretend to be. Most of them had drawn each other's characters on certain occasions; but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works.</P>
<P>Of the part of Scriblerus I need say nothing; his manner is well enough known, and approv'd by all but those who are too much concern'd to be judges.</P>
<P>The Imitations of the Ancients are added, to gratify those who either never read, or may have forgotten them; together with some of the parodies and allusions to the most excellent of the Moderns. If, from the frequency of the former, any man think the poem too much a Cento, our poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which Boileau did in earnest; and upon which Vida, Fracastorius, and many of the most emi∣nent Latin poets, professedly valued themselves.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the FIRST EDITION of The FOURTH BOOK of the DUNCIAD, when printed separately in the Year 1742.</HEAD>
<P>WE apprehend it can be deemed no injury to the author of the three first books of the Dunciad, that we publish this Fourth. It was found merely by accident, in taking a survey of the <HI>Library</HI> of a late eminent nobleman; but in so blotted a condition, and in so many detach'd pieces, as plainly shewed it to be not only <HI>incorrect,</HI> but <HI>unfinished.</HI> That the author of the three first books had a design to extend and complete his poem in this manner, appears from the dissertation prefix'd to it, where it is said, that <HI>the design is more extensive, and that we</HI>
<PB N="316" REF="330"/>
<HI>may expect other episodes to complete it:</HI> And from the declara∣tion in the argument to the third book, that <HI>the accomplishment of the prophecies therein, would be the theme hereafter of a greater Dunciad.</HI> But whether or no he be the author of this, we de∣clare ourselves ignorant. If he be, we are no more to be blamed for the publication of it, than Tucca and Varius for that of the last six books of the Aeneid, tho' perhaps inferior to the former.</P>
<P>If any person be possessed of a more perfect copy of this work, or of any other fragments of it, and will communicate them to the publisher, we shall make the next edition more com∣plete: In which we also promise to insert any <HI>Criticisms</HI> that shall be published (if at all to the purpose) with the <HI>Names</HI> of the <HI>Authors;</HI> or any letters sent us (tho' not to the purpose) shall yet be printed under the title of <HI>Epistolae Obscurorum Vi∣rorum;</HI> which, together with some others of the same kind for∣merly laid by for that end, may make no unpleasant addition to the future impressions of this poem.</P>

<P>I HAVE long had a design of giving some sort of Notes on the works of this poet. Before I had the happiness of his acquaintance, I had written a commentary on his <HI>Essay on Man,</HI> and have since finished another on the <HI>Essay on Criticism.</HI> There was one already on the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> which had met with general approbation: but I still thought some additions were wanting (of a more serious kind) to the humorous notes of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> and even to those written by Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ar∣buthnot,</HI> and others. I had lately the pleasure to pass some months with the author in the country, where I prevailed up∣on him to do what I had long desired, and favour me with his explanation of several passages in his works. It happened, that
<PB N="317" REF="331"/>
just at that juncture was published a ridiculous book against him, full of Personal Reflections, which furnished him with a lucky opportunity of improving <HI>This Poem,</HI> by giving it the only thing it wanted, a <HI>more considerable Heor.</HI> He was always sen∣sible of its defect in that particular, and owned he had let it pass with the Hero it had, purely for want of a better; not entertaining the least expectation that such an one was reserved for this Post, as has since obtained the <HI>Laurel:</HI> But since that had happened, he could no longer deny this justice either to <HI>him</HI> or the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>And yet I will venture to say, there was another motive which had still more weight with our Author: This person was one, who from every Folly (not to say Vice) of which another would be ashamed, has constantly derived a <HI>Vanity;</HI> and therefore was the <HI>man in the world who would least be hurt by it.</HI> <BIBL>W.

<P>WHEREAS, upon occasion of certain Pieces relating to the Gentlemen of the Dunciad, some have been willing to suggest, as if they looked upon them as an <HI>abuse:</HI> we can do no less than own, it is our opinion, that to call these Gentle∣man <HI>bad authors</HI> is no sort of <HI>abuse,</HI> but a great <HI>truth.</HI> We cannot alter this opinion without some reason; but we promise to do it in respect to every person who thinks it an injury to be represented as no <HI>Wit,</HI> or <HI>Poet,</HI> provided he procures a Certi∣ficate of his being really such, from any <HI>three of his companions</HI> in the Dunciad, or from Mr. <HI>Dennis singly,</HI> who is esteemed equal to any three of the number.</P>

<P>VERSE 285. <HI>Then ** try'd.]</HI> This is an instance of the Tenderness of our author. The person here intended writ an angry preface against him, grounded on a Mistake, which he afterwards honourably acknowledg'd in another printed pre∣face. Since when, he fell under a second mi∣stake, and abus'd both him and his Friend.</P>
<P>He is a writer of Genius and Spirit, tho' in his youth he was guilty of some pieces bor∣dering upon bombast. Our Poet here gives him a Panegyric instead of a Satire, being edify'd beyond measure, at this only instance he ever met with in his life, of one who was much a Poet, consessing himself in an Error: And has supprest his name, as thinking him capable of a second repentance.</P>
<P><PB REF="352" MS="y"/>
VERSE 175. <HI>Fam'd for good nature</HI> B **, &amp;c. D **, <HI>for pious passion to the youth.]</HI> The first of these was Son of the late Bi∣shop of S.

And Mr. <HI>D.</HI> writ an Epilogue for <HI>Powel</HI>'s Puppet-show, reflecting on the same work. Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> gives us this further account of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> <Q>“He did <HI>himself write</HI> a Letter to the E. of <HI>Halifax, informing his Lordship</HI> (as he tells him) <HI>of what he knew much better before:</HI> And he <HI>publish'd in his own name</HI> several political pamphlets, A cer∣tain information of a certain discourse, A se∣cond Tale of a Tub, &amp;c. <HI>All which</HI> it is strongly affirmed <HI>were written by</HI> Colonel <HI>Ducket.”</HI></Q> CURI▪, Key, p. 17.

VERSE 240. <HI>Can make a</HI> Cibber.] Mr. <HI>Colly Cibber,</HI> an Author and Actor; of a good share of wit, and <HI>uncommon vivacity,</HI> which are much improved by the <HI>conversation</HI> he enjoys, which is of the <HI>best.</HI> JACOB <HI>Lives of</HI> Dram.

Mr. <HI>Jacob</HI> omit∣ted to remark, that he is particularly admirable in Tragedy.</P>
<P>VERSE 244.—<HI>Johnson.] Charles Johnson,</HI> famous for writing a Play every season, and for being at <HI>Button</HI>'s every day. He had probably thriven better in his Vocation had he been a small matter leaner. He may justly be called a Martyr to obesity, and to have fallen a victim to the ro∣tundity of his parts. CHA. of the TIMES, print∣ed by CURL, pag. 19. Some of his Plays are, Love in a Forest <HI>(Shakespear</HI>'s As you like it) Wife's Relief <HI>(Shirley</HI>'s Gamester) The Victim <HI>(Racine</HI>'s Iphigenia) The Sultaness <HI>(Racine</HI>'s Baja∣zet (the prologue to which abused Dr. <HI>Arburthnot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gay.)</HI> The <HI>Cobler</HI> of <HI>Preston,</HI> his own.</P>
<P>VERSE 189. <HI>My</HI> Flaccus.] A familiar man¦ner of speaking used by modern Criticks of a favourite Author.

VERSE 66.] Curl<HI>'s</HI> Corinna.] This name it seems was taken by one Mrs. <HI>T,</HI> who procured some private Letters of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, while almost a boy, to Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and sold them without the consent of either of those gentlemen to <HI>Curl,</HI> who printed them in 12<SUP>•</SUP> 1727. He has discover'd her to be the pub∣lisher in his <HI>Key,</HI> p. 11. But our Poet had no thought of reflecting on her in this passage; on the contrary, he has been inform'd she is a decent woman and in misfortunes. We only take this opportunity of mentioning the.</P>

<P>VERSE 2 275.—<HI>And am I now three∣score?]▪</HI> I shall here, to prove my impartiality, remark a great oversight in our author as to the age of Mr. <HI>Dennis.</HI> He must have been some years above threescore in the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>George Thorold,</HI> which was in 1720, and Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> was born (as he himself inform'd us in Mr. <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Lives before-mentioned) in 1657; since when he has happily liv'd eight years more, and is already senior to Mr. <HI>Durfey,</HI> who hither∣to of all our Poets, enjoy'd the longest, bodily, Life.</P>

VERSE 130. Cook <HI>shall be</HI> Prior.] The man here specify'd was the son of a <HI>Muggleto∣nian,</HI> who kept a Publick-house at <HI>Braintree</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> He writ a thing call'd <HI>The Battle of Poets,</HI> of which <HI>Philips</HI> and <HI>Welsted</HI> were the heroes, and wherein our author was attack'd in his moral character, in relation to his <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Shakespear:</HI> He writ moreover a Farce of <HI>Penelope,</HI> in the preface of which also he was squinted at: and some malevolent things in the <HI>British, London</HI> and <HI>Daily Journals.</HI> His chief work was a trans∣slation of <HI>Hesiod,</HI> to which <HI>Theobald</HI> writ notes, and half-notes, as hath already been said.</P>
<P>VERSE ibid. <HI>And</HI> Concanen, Swift.] <HI>Mat∣thew Concanen,</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> an anonymous slan∣derer, and publisher of other men's slanders, par∣ticularly on Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> to whom he had obliga∣tions, and from whom he had received both in a collection of Poems for his benefit and other∣wise, no small assistance; To which <HI>Smedley</HI> (one of his brethren in enmity to <HI>Swift)</HI> alludes in his <HI>Metam.</HI> of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> p. 7. accusing him of having <Q>“boasted of what he had not written, but others had revis'd and done for him.”</Q> He was also author of several scurrilities in the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> and <HI>London Journals;</HI> and of a pamphlet call'd a <HI>Supplement</HI> to the <HI>Profund,</HI> wherein he deals very unfairly with our Poet, not only fre∣quently blaming Mr. <HI>Broome</HI>'s verses as his, (for which he might indeed seem in some degree ac∣countable, having corrected what that gentleman did) but those of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and others. To this rare piece, some-body humo∣rously caus'd him to take for his motto, <HI>De pro∣fundis clamavi.</HI></P>

He endeavour'd to create some mis-understanding between our author and Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> whom also soon after he a∣bused as much. His constant cry was, that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> was an Enemy to the government; and in particular he was the avowed author of a re∣port very industriously spread, that he had a hand in a Party-paper call'd the <HI>Examiner:</HI> A falshood well known to those yet living, who had the di∣rection and publication of it.</P>

<P>VERSE 323. <HI>Dormitory wall.]</HI> The Dor∣mitory in <HI>Westminster</HI> was a building intended for the lodging of the King's Scholars; toward which a sum was left by Dr. <HI>Edw.

<P>The time and date of the Action is evidently in the last reign, when the office of City Poet expir'd upon the death of <HI>Elkanah Settle,</HI> and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>Geo. Thorold.</HI> But there may arise some obscurity in Chronology from the <HI>Names</HI> in the Poem, by the inevi∣table removal of some Authors, and insertion of others, in their Niches. For whoever will consider the Unity of the whole design, will be sensible, that the <HI>Poem was not made for these Authors, but these Authors for the Poem:</HI> And I should judge they were clapp'd in as they rose, fresh and fresh, and chang'd from day to day, in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thrust new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; since when he shall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the Persons than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as they are, than to change them for <HI>fictitious names,</HI> by which the Satyr would only be multiplied▪ and applied to many instead of one. Had the Hero, for instance, been called <HI>Codrus,</HI> how many would have affirm'd him to be Mr. <HI>W</HI>—Mr. <HI>D</HI>—Sir <HI>R—B—,</HI> &amp;c. but now, all that unjust scandal is saved, by calling him <HI>Theobald,</HI> which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person.</P>
<P>I am indeed aware, that this name may to some appear too <HI>mean,</HI> for the Hero of an Epic Poem: But it is hoped, they will alter that opinion, when they find, that an Author no less eminent than <HI>la Bruyere</HI> has thought him worthy a place in his Characters.</P>
<P>Voudriez vous, <HI>THEOBALDE,</HI> que je crusse que vous êtes baisse? que vou n'êtes plus Poete, ni bel esprit? que vous êtes presentement aussi mauvais Juge d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tout genre d'Ouvrage, que mechant Auteur?

<P>THE <HI>Errata</HI> of this Edition we thought (gentle reader)to have trusted to thy candor and benignity, to correct with thy pen, as acci∣dental Faults escaped the press: But seeing that certain censors do give to such the name of <HI>Corruptions of the Text</HI> and <HI>false Readings,</HI> charge them on the Editor, and judge that correcting the same is to be called <HI>Restoring,</HI> and an <HI>At∣chievement that brings Honour to the Critic;</HI> we have in like manner taken it upon ourselves.</P>
<P>Book i. Verse 8. <HI>E'er Pallas issu'd from the Thund'rers head.

<P>After so shameful ignorance in <HI>Greek, Latin, French, English,</HI> Quantity, Accent, Rhyme▪ Grammar, we cannot wonder at such Error as the following.
