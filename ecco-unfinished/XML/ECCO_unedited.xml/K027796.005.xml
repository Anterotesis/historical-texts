<L>AN ample hide divine <HI>Ulysses</HI>
spread,</L>
<L>And form'd of fleecy skins his
humble bed:</L>
<L>(The remnants of the spoil the

<L>Then o'er the chief, <HI>Eurynome</HI> the chaste<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows,</L>
<L>And ruminating wrath, he scorns repose.</L>
<L>As thus pavilion'd in the porch he lay,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="10"/>Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey,</L>
<L>Whilst to nocturnal joys impure, repair</L>
<L>With wanton glee, the prostituted fair.</L>
<L>His heart with rage this new dishonour stung,</L>
<L>Wav'ring his thoughts in dubious balance hung;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="15"/>Or, instant should he quench the guilty flame</L>
<L>With their own blood, and intercept the shame;</L>
<L>Or to their lust indulge a last embrace,</L>
<L>And let the Peers consummate the disgrace?</L>
<L>Round his swol'n heart the murm'rous fury rowls;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="20"/>As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls,</L>
<L>And bays the stranger groom: so wrath comprest</L>
<L>Recoiling, mutter'd thunder in his breast.</L>
<L>Poor suff'ring heart! he cry'd, support the pain</L>
<L>Of wounded honour, and thy rage restrain.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="25"/>Not fiercer woes thy fortitude cou'd foil,</L>

Dire <HI>Polypheme</HI> devour'd: I then was freed</L>
<L>By patient prudence, from the death decreed.</L>
<L>Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast,</L>
<L>Tempests of wrath his soul no longer tost;<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd:</L>
<L>As one who long with pale-ey'd famine pin'd,</L>
<L>The sav'ry cates on glowing embers cast</L>
<L>Incessant turns, impatient for repast:</L>
<L><HI>Ulysses</HI> so, from side to side devolv'd,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>In self-debate the Suitors doom resolv'd.</L>
<L>When in the form of mortal nymph array'd,</L>
<L>From heav'n descends the <HI>Jove</HI>-born martial Maid;</L>
<L>And hov'ring o'er his head in view confess'd,</L>
<L>The Goddess thus her fav'rite care address'd.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Oh thou, of mortals most inur'd to woes!</L>
<L>Why rowl those eyes unfriended of repose?</L>
<L>Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care;</L>
<L>Blest in thy Queen! blest in thy blooming heir!</L>
<L>Whom, to the Gods when suppliant fathers bow,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>They name the standard of their dearest vow.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin'd)</L>
<L>Deeds full of fate distract my various mind,</L>
<L>In contemplation rapt. This hostile crew</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="50"/>What single arm hath prowess to subdue?</L>
<L>Or if by <HI>Jove</HI>'s, and thy auxiliar aid,</L>
<L>They're doom'd to bleed; O say, coelestial maid!</L>
<L>Where shall <HI>Ulysses</HI> shun, or how sustain,</L>
<L>Nations embattel'd to revenge the slain?</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="55"/>Oh impotence of faith! <HI>Minerva</HI> cries,</L>
<L>If man on frail unknowing man relies,</L>
<L>Doubt you the Gods? Lo <HI>Pallas</HI>' self descends,</L>
<L>Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends.</L>
<L>In me affianc'd, fortify thy breast,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="60"/>Tho' myriads leagu'd thy rightful claim contest;</L>
<L>My sure divinity shall bear the shield,</L>
<L>And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.</L>
<L>Now, pay the debt to craving nature due,</L>
<L>Her faded pow'rs with balmy rest renew.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="65"/>She ceas'd: Ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes;</L>
<L>His care dissolves in visionary joys:</L>
<L>The Goddess pleas'd, regains her natal skies.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Not so the Queen; The downy bands of sleep</L>
<L>By grief relax'd, she wak'd again to weep:</L>
<L>A gloomy pause ensu'd of dumb despair;<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Then thus her fate invok'd, with fervent pray'r.</L>
<L><HI>Diana!</HI> speed thy deathful ebon dart,</L>
<L>And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart.</L>
<L>Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from humane race,</L>
<L>Tost thro' the void, illimitable space:<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud,</L>
<L>Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shrowd!</L>
<L>So, <HI>Pandarus,</HI> thy hopes, three orphan fair</L>
<L>Were doom'd to wander thro' the devious air;</L>
<L>Thy self untimely and thy consort dy'd,<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>But four Coelestials both your cares supply'd.</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> in tender delicacy rears</L>
<L>With honey, milk, and wine, their infant years:</L>
<L>Imperial <HI>Juno</HI> to their youth assign'd</L>
<L>A form majestic, and sagacious mind:<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>With shapely growth <HI>Diana</HI> grac'd their bloom;</L>
<L>And <HI>Pallas</HI> taught the texture of the loom.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
But whilst to learn their lots in nuptial love,</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Cytherea</HI> sought the bow'r of <HI>Jove;</HI></L>
<L><MILESTONE N="90"/>(The God supreme, to whose eternal eye</L>
<L>The registers of fate expanded lie)</L>
<L>Wing'd <HI>Harpies</HI> snatch'd th' unguarded charge away,</L>

<L>Be such my lot! Or thou <HI>Diana</HI> speed</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="95"/>Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead:</L>
<L>To seek my Lord among the warrior-train,</L>
<L>E're second vows my bridal faith profane.</L>
<L>When woes the waking sense alone assail,</L>
<L>Whilst night extends her soft oblivious veil,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="100"/>Of other wretches care the torture ends:</L>
<L>No truce the warfare of my heart suspends!</L>
<L>The night renews the day-distracting theme,</L>
<L>And airy terrors sable ev'ry dream.</L>
<L>The last alone a kind illusion wrought,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="105"/>And to my bed my lov'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> brought,</L>
<L>In manly bloom, and each majestic grace</L>
<L>As when for <HI>Troy</HI> he left my fond embrace:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Such raptures in my beating bosom rise,</L>
<L>I deem it sure a vision of the skies.</L>
<L>Thus, whilst <HI>Aurora</HI> mounts her purple throne,<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>In audible laments she breathes her moan:</L>
<L>The sounds assault <HI>Ulysses</HI>' wakeful ear;</L>
<L>Mis-judging of the cause, a sudden fear</L>
<L>Of his arrival known, the Chief alarms;</L>
<L>He thinks the Queen is rushing to his arms.<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Up-springing from his couch, with active haste</L>
<L>The fleece and carpet in the dome he plac'd;</L>
<L>(The hide, without, imbib'd the morning air.)</L>
<L>And thus the Gods invok'd, with ardent pray'r.</L>
<L><HI>Jove,</HI> and etherial thrones! with heav'n to friend<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>If the long series of my woes shall end;</L>
<L>Of humane race now rising from repose,</L>
<L>Let one a blissful omen here disclose:</L>
<L>And to confirm my faith, propitious <HI>Jove!</HI></L>
<L>Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above.<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>Whilst lowly thus the Chief adoring bows,</L>
<L>The pitying God his guardian aid avows.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Loud from a saphire sky his thunder sounds:</L>
<L>With springing hope the Heroe's heart rebounds.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="130"/>Soon, with consummate joy to crown his pray'r,</L>
<L>An omen'd Voice invades his ravish'd ear.</L>
<L>Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoin'd,</L>
<L>Twelve female slaves the gift of <HI>Ceres</HI> grind;</L>
<L>Task'd for the royal board to bolt the bran</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="135"/>From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man)</L>
<L>Discharging to the day the labour due,</L>
<L>Now early to repose the rest withdrew;</L>
<L>One maid, unequal to the task assign'd,</L>
<L>Still turn'd the toilsome mill with anxious mind;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="140"/>And thus in bitterness of soul divin'd.</L>
<L>Father of Gods and men! whose thunders rowl</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>Cerulean</HI> Vault, and shake the Pole;</L>
<L>Whoe'er from heav'n has gain'd this rare Ostent,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="145"/>In this blest moment of accepted pray'r</L>
<L>Piteous, regard a wretch consum'd with care!</L>
<L>Instant, O <HI>Jove!</HI> confound the Suitor train,</L>
<L>For whom o'er-toil'd I grind the golden grain:</L>

Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast,</L>
<L>And be this festival decreed their last!<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Big with their doom denounc'd in earth and sky,</L>
<L><HI>Ulysses</HI>' heart dilates with secret joy.</L>
<L>Mean-time the menial train with unctuous wood</L>
<L>Heap'd high the genial hearth, <HI>Vulcanian</HI> food:</L>
<L>When, early dress'd, advanc'd the royal heir;<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>With manly grasp he wav'd a martial spear,</L>
<L>A radiant sabre grac'd his purple zone,</L>
<L>And on his foot the golden sandal shone.</L>
<L>His steps impetuous to the portal press'd;</L>
<L>And <HI>Euryclea</HI> thus he there address'd.<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Say thou, to whom my youth its nurture owes,</L>
<L>Was care for due refection, and repose,</L>
<L>Bestow'd the stranger guest? Or waits he griev'd,</L>
<L>His age not honour'd, nor his wants reliev'd?</L>
<L>Promiscuous grace on all the Queen confers;<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>(In woes bewilder'd, oft the wisest errs.)</L>
<L>The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires,</L>

<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
She thus: O cease that ever-honour'd name</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="170"/>To blemish now; it ill deserves your blame.</L>
<L>A bowl of gen'rous wine suffic'd the guest;</L>
<L>In vain the Queen the night-refection prest;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd he court repose in downy state,</L>
<L>Unbless'd, abandon'd to the rage of fate!</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="175"/>A hide beneath the portico was spread,</L>
<L>And fleecy skins compos'd an humble bed:</L>
<L>A downy carpet cast with duteous care,</L>
<L>Secur'd him from the keen nocturnal air.</L>
<L>His cornel javelin poiz'd, with regal port,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="180"/>To the sage <HI>Greeks</HI> conven'd in <HI>Themis</HI>' court,</L>
<L>Forth-issuing from the dome the Prince repair'd:</L>

<L>And let th'abstersive sponge the board renew:</L>

<L>The lunar feast-rites to the God of day.<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>She said; with duteous haste a bevy fair</L>
<L>Of twenty virgins to the spring repair:</L>
<L>With varied toils the rest adorn the dome.</L>
<L>Magnificent, and blithe, the Suitors come.</L>
<L>Some wield the sounding ax; the dodder'd oaks<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>Divide, obedient to the forceful strokes.</L>
<L>Soon from the fount, with each a brimming urn,</L>

<L>Three porkers for the feast, all brawny chin'd,</L>
<L>He brought; the choicest of the tusky kind:<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>In lodgments first secure his care he view'd,</L>

<L>What guest is he, of such majestic air?</L>
<L>His lineage and paternal clime declare:</L>

<P>VERSE 12. <HI>With wanton glee, the prostituted fair.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>USTATHIUS</HI> expatiates upon the conduct of
these female servants of <HI>Penelope.</HI> Silence and a
decent reserve (remarks that Author) is the
ornament of the fair sex; levity and laugh∣ter
betray them into an unguarded beha∣viour,
and make them susceptible of wan∣ton
impressions. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> as <HI>Pausanias</HI>
informs us, had a Temple sacred to Love and
<HI>Venus</HI> the Whisperer. <HI>Venus</HI> was called the Whisperer (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
because they who there offer'd up their prayers apply'd their
mouths to the ear of the statue of that Goddess, and whisper'd
their petitions; an Intimation, that Women ought to govern
their tongue, and not let it transgress either by loudness or loqua∣city.
But this no way affects the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> they
speak so well, they should never be silent.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<HI>Ulysses, Homer</HI> tells us, is almost provok'd to kill these females
with his own hands: This has been imagin'd a thought unwor∣thy
an Heroe. The like objection has been made against <HI>Aentas</HI>
in <HI>Virgil</HI> (<HI>Aeneid,</HI> lib. 2. ver. 567.)
<Q><L><HI>Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The graceless</HI> Helen <HI>in the porch I spy'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of</HI> Vesta'<HI>s temple: there she lurk'd alone,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Muffled she sate, and what she could, unknown;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,</HI></L>
<L>Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward.</L></Q>
This whole passage is said to have been expung'd from <HI>Virgil</HI> by
<HI>Tucca</HI> and <HI>Varius;</HI> for as <HI>Virgil</HI> there expresses it,
<Q><L>'Tis true a soldier can small honour gain,</L>
<L>And boast no conquest from a woman slain, <HI>Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
But the Objection is probably made with too great severity, both
against <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil:</HI> It is no disgrace to the best or bra∣vest
man, to be subject to such passions as betray him into no
unworthy actions: A Heroe is not suppos'd to be insensible;
he distinguishes himself as such, if he restrains them within the
bounds of reason. Both <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> are fir'd with a just
indignation, and this is agreeable to human nature; but both of
them proceed to no outragious action, and this shews that their
passions are govern'd by superior reason. However this resent∣ment
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is less liable to objection than that of <HI>Aeneas:
Ulysses</HI> subdues his indignation by the reflection of his own
reason; but <HI>Virgil</HI> introduces a Machine to compose the spirit
of <HI>Aeneas:</HI>
<Q><L>—all shining heav'nly bright,</L>
<L>My mother stood reveal'd before my sight,</L>
<L>She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
It may be further added that the case is very different between
<HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Ulysses.</HI> The persons whom <HI>Ulysses</HI> intends to punish
are his subjects and servants, and such a punishment would be no
more than an act of justice, as he is their Master and King; and
we find in the sequel of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> that he actually inflicts it.
It should therefore be thought an instance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s judgment,
in painting the disorders of these servants in such strong colours,
that we may acknowledge the justice, when he afterwards brings
them to punishment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 20. <HI>As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls,</HI> &amp;c.]
This in the original is a very bold expression, but <HI>Homer</HI> to
soften it, instances a comparison which reconciles us to it. <HI>Ennius</HI>
has litterally translated it, as <HI>Spondanus</HI> observes:
<Q>—animusque in pectore <HI>latrat.</HI></Q>
That is word for word,
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
The similitude itself is very expressive; as the mastiff barks to
guard her young, so labours the soul of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in defence of his
Son and Wife, <HI>Penelope</HI> and <HI>Telemachus. Dacier</HI> was afraid that
the comparison could not be render'd with any beauty in the
<HI>French</HI> tongue, and therefore has substituted another in the room
of it, <HI>Son coeur rugissoit au dedans de luy, comme un Lion rugit au∣tour
d'une bergerie, où il ne sçauroit entrer.</HI> But however more
noble the Lion may be than the Mastiff, it is evident that she
utterly deviates from the allusion: The Mastiff rages in defence
of her young, <HI>Ulysses</HI> of his Son <HI>Telemachus;</HI> but how is this
represented by a Lion roaring round a fold, which he is not to
defend, but destroy? We have therefore chosen to follow <HI>Homer</HI>
in the more humble but more expressive similitude; and what
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
will entirely reconcile us to it, is the great honour which was
paid to Dogs by the Ancients: they were kept as a piece of
state by Princes and Heroes, and therefore a comparison drawn
from them was held to be as noble as if it had been drawn
from a Lion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 23. Poor suff'ring heart! he cry'd, support the pain</L>
<L>Of wounded honour, and thy rage restrain.]</L></Q>
These two Verses are quoted by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Phaedo,</HI> where he
treats of the soul's immortality; He makes use of them to prove
that <HI>Homer</HI> understood the soul to be uncompounded and di∣stinct
from the body. “If the soul, argues that Author, were a
compounded substance, if it were harmony (as some philo∣sophically
assert) she would never act discordantly from the
parts which compose it; but we see the contrary, we see the
soul guide and govern the parts of which she herself is pretend∣ed
to be composed; she resists, threatens and restrains our pas∣sions,
our fears, avarice and anger: in short, the soul speaks to
the body as to a substance of a nature entirely different from
its own. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore evidently understood that the soul
ought to govern and direct the passions, and that it is of a
nature more divine than harmony.</P>
<P>This is undoubtedly very just reasoning, and there is an expres∣sion,
observes <HI>Dacier,</HI> that bears the same import in the holy
Scriptures: <HI>The heart of</HI> David <HI>smote him when he number'd the
people.</HI> There is this difference; in <HI>Homer</HI> by <HI>heart</HI> is understood
the corporeal substance, in the Scriptures, the spiritual; but both
make a manifest distinction between the soul and the body.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 32. <HI>As one who long,</HI> &amp;c.] No passage in the
whole <HI>Odyssey</HI> has fall'n under more ridicule than this compari∣son;
Monsieur <HI>Perault</HI> is particularly severe upon it: <HI>Homer</HI> (says
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
that Critic) compares <HI>Ulysses</HI> turning in his bed to a black-pud∣ding
broiling on a gridiron; whereas the truth is, he compares
that Hero turning and tossing in his bed, burning with impa∣tience
to satisfy himself with the blood of the Suitors, to a
man in sharp hunger preparing the entrails of a victim over a
great fire; and the agitation represents the agitation of <HI>Ulysses.
Homer</HI> compares not the thing, but the persons.</P>
<P><HI>Boileau,</HI> in his notes upon <HI>Longinus,</HI> answers this objection.
It is notorious that the belly of some animals was one of
the most delicious dishes amongst the ancients: that the
<HI>sumex</HI> or sow's belly was boasted of for its excellence by
the <HI>Romans,</HI> and forbidden by a sumptuary law as too volup∣tuous.
Besides, the <HI>Greek</HI> word used to express a black-pudding
was not invented in the days of <HI>Homer. Ogylby</HI> indeed thus
renders it:
<Q>As one a pudding broiling on the coals.</Q>
But you will ask, Is not the allusion mean at best, and does
it not convey a low image? Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> answers in the
negative, in his notes upon <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Poetics. The comparison
is borrow'd from sacrifices which yielded blood and fat, and
was therefore so far from being despicable, that it was look'd
upon with veneration by antiquity. <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. of the <HI>Iliad:</HI>
<Q><L>On these, in double cawls involv'd with art,</L>
<L>The choicest morsels lay from every part.</L></Q>
The <HI>Cawls</HI> and the <HI>choicest morsels</HI> were the fat of the Victim,
selected as the best part of it, to be offer'd to the Gods. We
may find that the thought was noble in the oriental language,
for the Author of <HI>Ecclesiast.</HI> makes use of it, 47. 2. <HI>As is the
fat taken from the peace-offering, so was</HI> David <HI>chosen out of the
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
children of</HI> Israel. And the same allusion which was used to represent
the worth and excellence of <HI>David,</HI> could be no degadation to
<HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>But what is understood by the <HI>belly of the beast, full of fat
and blood? Boileau</HI> is of opinion that those words denote the fat
and the blood which are in those parts of an animal naturally:
but he is in an error, as appears evidently from these lines,
<HI>lib.</HI> 18. of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<HI>Implentes sanguine &amp; pinguedine, in coenâ deponamus;</HI> a demonstra∣tion
that <HI>Homer</HI> intends not the natural fat and blood of the
animal.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 56. If man on frail unknowing man relies,</L>
<L>Doubt you the Gods?—]</L></Q>
There is excellent reasoning in this: If a friend whom we
know to be wise and powerful, advises us, we are ready to
follow his instructions; the divine Being gives us his council, and
we refuse it. Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> observes that <HI>Epictetus</HI> had this
passage in his view, and beautify'd his morality with it. “The
protection of a Prince or Potentate (says that Author) gives us
full tranquility, and banishes from us all uneasy apprehension.
We have an all-powerful Being for our Protector, and for our
Father; and yet the knowledge of it is not sufficient to drive
away our fears, inquietudes and discontents.”</P>
<P>What <HI>Homer</HI> further puts into the mouth of the Goddess of
Wisdom is consonant to sacred verity, and agrees with the lan∣guage
of the holy Scripture; <HI>Psalm</HI> xxvii. 3. <HI>Tho' an host of men were
laid against me, yet shall not my Heart be afraid.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet almost in every book mentions the destruction of
the Suitors by the single hand of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to reconcile us to it by
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
degrees, that we may not be shock'd at the great Catastrophe
of the Poem as incredible: It is particularly judicious to
insist upon it in this place in a manner so solemn, to prepare us
for the approaching event. If the destruction of the Suitors
should appear humanly improbable by being ascrib'd solely to
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> it is at least reconcileable to divine probability, and becomes
credible thro' the Intervention of a Goddess.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 72. Diana! <HI>speed thy deathful ehon dart,</HI> &amp;c.] I doubt
not but the Reader will be pleased with the beauty of this soliloquy.
There is an assemblage of tender images and moving complaints,
and yet they are such as betray no meanness of spirit: The la∣mentation
of <HI>Penelope</HI> is the lamentation of a Queen and Heroine;
she mourns, but it is with dignity. The Poet makes a good use
of her sorrows, and they excellently sustain her character of per∣severing
to elude the addresses of the Suitors, when she wishes
even to die rather than to yield to them.</P>
<P>But I confess the inserting so many particularities of the
daughters of <HI>Pandarus,</HI> &amp;c. greatly lessens the pathetic of this
speech.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 74. <HI>Snatch me, ye whirlwinds!</HI> &amp;c.] The ancients
(says <HI>Dacier</HI>) were persuaded that some persons were carried away
by storms and whirlwinds. I would rather imagine such expressi∣ons
to be entirely figurative and poetical; it is probable that
what gave occasion to these fictions might be no more than
the sudden deaths of some persons, and their disappearance
was ascrib'd, in the language of Poetry, to storms and whirl∣winds.
The <HI>Orientals</HI> delighted in such bold figures. <HI>Job</HI> xxvii. 21.
<HI>The east wind carrieth him away, and as a storm hurrieth him out
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
of his place.</HI> And <HI>Isaiah</HI> li. 16. <HI>The wind shall carry them away,
and the whirlwind shall scatter them.</HI></P>

<P><Q><L>VERSE 82. Venus <HI>in tender delicacy rears</HI></L>
<L>With honey, milk, and wine, their infant years.]</L></Q>
Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> observes upon this passage; <HI>Venus</HI> is said to
feed these Infants with wine, milk, and honey; that is, she nursed
them in their infancy, with plenty and abundance. For this is
the import of the expression: a land flowing with milk and
honey means a land of the greatest fertility, as is evident from
the writings of <HI>Moses.</HI> So the Prophet, <HI>Butter and honey shall
he eat, till he knows how to refuse the evil and chuse the good;</HI> that
is, till the age of discretion.</P>

<P><Q><L>VERSE 84. <HI>Imperial</HI> Juno <HI>to their youth assign'd</HI></L>

It may seem that <HI>Homer</HI> ascribes improper gifts to this Goddess;
Wisdom is the portion of <HI>Minerva,</HI> Beauty of <HI>Venus,</HI> why then
are they here ascrib'd to <HI>Juno? Spondanus</HI> calls this an insolvable
difficulty. <HI>Dacier</HI> explains it by saying, that the beauty of Prin∣cesses
is different from that of persons of inferiour station: their
beauty consists in a majesty that is every way great and noble,
and strikes with awe, very different from the little affectations
and formal softnesses of inferior beauty; the former kind is the
gift of <HI>Venus</HI> to the lower part of the fair sex, the latter is be∣stow'd
on Princesses and Queens, by <HI>Juno</HI> the Regent of the

It is not evident what is meant by these Princesses being carried
away by the <HI>Harpies: Eustathius</HI> thinks that they wander'd from
their own country, and fell into the power of cruel governesses,
whose severities the Poet ascribes to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Furies. Dacier</HI>

own son) fear'd a like calamity; and dreading marriage, retir'd to
some distant solitude, where never being heard of, it gave room for
the fiction. It must be allow'd that the thought excellently agrees
with the wishes of <HI>Penelope:</HI> These Princesses were taken away at
the point of their marriage; <HI>Penelope</HI> believes herself to be in the

nuptials. This Speech has a further effect; we find <HI>Penelope</HI> reduc'd

how can inferior persons (says <HI>Dacier</HI>) expect to be exempted,

These words are to be ascrib'd to the excess of sorrow which <HI>Phi∣laetius</HI>
feels for the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for they certainly trans∣gress
the bounds of reason. But if we consider the state of The∣ology

“How can <HI>Jupiter</HI> (says <HI>Philaetius</HI>) who is our father, throw his
children into such an abyss of misery? Thou, oh <HI>Jove,</HI> hast
made us, yet hast no compassion when we suffer.” It is no
easy matter to answer this argument from the heathen Theology,
and no wonder therefore if it confounds the reason of <HI>Philaetius;</HI>

the difficulty: that state will be a time of retribution; it will
amply recompense the good man for all his calamities, or as <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>

It may be observ'd in general that this introduction of <HI>Philaetius</HI>

his cautious character, being before certify'd of his honesty.</P>
<P>I will only add that <HI>Philaetius</HI> is not to be look'd upon as a
common servant, but as an officer of state and dignity: and what∣ever
has been said in these annotations concerning <HI>Eumaeus</HI> may

'tis true the sacrificial term of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is mention'd; but perhaps
that word may not denote a Sacrifice; for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, tho' it primarily

calls it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>excessive, inextinguish'd;</HI> and again, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,

a real and unfeign'd laughter. But how will the words be
brought to bear this construction? Very naturally: They laugh'd
as if they had borrow'd their cheeks, as if their cheeks were not
their own, and consequently they were not afraid to use them
with licence and excess; (such persons as the Suitors having no re∣gard
for any thing that belongs to another.)</P>

This is the opinion of <HI>Dacier:</HI> But there are some lines in the

of laughing with other mens cheeks, <HI>Homer</HI> adds, that their eyes

the reason why they are tost by so sudden a transition to
contrary passions, from laughter to tears; this moment they laugh
extravagantly, and the next they weep with equal excess: persons
in such a condition being liable to such vicissitudes.</P>

This is to be look'd upon as a prodigy, the belief of which was
establish'd in the old world, and consequently, whether true or
false, may be allow'd to have a place in Poetry. See Book XII.
Annot. 32.</P>
<P>In the following speech of <HI>Theoclymenus</HI> there is a beautiful en∣thusiasm
of Poetry; but how are we to understand that <HI>Theocly∣menus</HI>
sees these wonders, when they are invisible to all the Suitors?
<HI>Theoclymenus</HI> was a Prophet, and speaks of things future as pre∣sent;
it is the eye of the Prophet that sees these events, and the
language of prophecy that speaks of them as present. Thus when
he says he sees the palace red with blood, and throng'd with
ghosts; he anticipates the event, which is verify'd in the approach∣ing
death of the Suitors.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> is of opinion that by the last words of this speech
<HI>Theoclymenus</HI> intends to express an Eclipse of the sun; this being
the day of the new moon, when eclipses happen. Others under∣stand
by it the death of the Suitors, as when we say the sun is for∣ever
gone down upon the dead: <HI>Theocritus</HI> uses that expres∣sion,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Homer</HI> means by it, that the
Suitors shall never more behold the light of the sun,
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
So far <HI>Eustathius.</HI> It may be added that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets used
the same expression in this latter signification. Thus <HI>Catullus,</HI>
<Q><L>Nobis, quùm semel occidit brevis lux,</L>
<L>Nox est perpetua una dormienda.</L></Q>
Either of these expositions makes the passage intelligible.</P>

words to be a prophecy; and therefore by way of derision com∣mand
him to be carry'd into a place of publick resort, that he
may convince himself it is full day. <HI>Eustathius</HI> imagines they
intended to reproach him with drunkenness, because it makes all
objects appear indistinct and different from the reality: He quotes
a pleasant expression of <HI>Anacharsis</HI> to this purpose: A certain per∣son

and serious: “I have <HI>eyes,</HI> and therefore have no occasion for
a guide to lead me from the palace: I have <HI>ears,</HI> and there∣fore

<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 456. <HI>To some</HI> Sicilian <HI>mart these courtiers send.]</HI> It is
evident from this passage that the name of <HI>Sicily</HI> is very antient,
and <HI>Eustathius</HI> makes the following remark upon it: That the
reason why the Poet never mentions this word in describing the
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
wandrings of <HI>Ulysses</HI> which happen chiefly near <HI>Sicily,</HI> is to make
his Poetry more surprising and marvellous; and that the more to
countenance those fabulous relations and miracles which he
has told to the <HI>Pheacians,</HI> he chuses to speak of it by names
less known, and less familiar to his Readers. <HI>Dacier</HI> ob∣serves
from <HI>Bochart,</HI> that this island receiv'd the name of <HI>Sicily</HI>
from the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> long before the birth of <HI>Homer,</HI> or the war
of <HI>Troy: Siclul</HI> in their language signifies <HI>perfection;</HI> they call'd it
the <HI>Isle of perfection,</HI> because it held the chief rank amongst all the
islands of the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> “It is the largest and best island
in all our seas,” says <HI>Strabo.</HI> It has likewise been thought to
have taken its name from the <HI>Syrian</HI> language, namely from <HI>Segol,</HI>
or <HI>Segul,</HI> a <HI>Raisin.</HI> For long before the vine was known in <HI>Afric,
Sicily</HI> was famous for its Vineyards, and from thence the <HI>Cartha∣ginians</HI>
imported their raisins and wines. <HI>Homer</HI> celebrates this
island for its vines in the 9th <HI>Odyssey.</HI>
<Q><L>Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour,</L>
<L><HI>And</HI> Jove <HI>descends in each prolific show'r.</HI></L></Q>
It is likewise probable from this passage, that the <HI>Sicilians</HI> traded
in slaves; for their lands were fertil, and they merchandiz'd for
them to manure the ground. I should rather think that they
were remarkable for their barbarity to their slaves; the Suitors
speaking by way of terror to intimidate <HI>Theoclymenus;</HI> and the
expression seems to bear the same import with that concerning
<HI>Echetus,</HI> we will <HI>send him to</HI> Echetus, or <HI>the</HI> Sicilians, <HI>who will
use him with the utmost cruelty.</HI></P>

This circumstance (observes <HI>Eustathius</HI>) is not inserted in vain:

conduct according to the occasion: Now for instance, she per∣ceives

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
TWENTY-FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS book is entitled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the
<HI>proposition of the Bow:</HI> This action of <HI>Pene∣lope</HI>
has given occasion of raillery both to
modern and ancient Critics; they insinuate
that she propos'd this exercise of the bow to
try the strength of her gallants, determining
to have regard to that single qualification in
the choice of her husband.
<Q><L>Penelope vires juvenum tentabat in arcu,</L>
<L>Qui latus argueret, corneus arcus erat.</L></Q>
They interpret <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> into a sense very contrary to the
character of <HI>Penelope.</HI> 'Tis true, other Authors have directly
charg'd her with Inchastity, and affirm that she had a son na∣med
<HI>Pan,</HI> because <HI>all</HI> the Suitors had a share in him. <HI>Lycophron</HI>
calls her
<Q><PB N="84" REF="83"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>It is the exercise of the Bow that has occasion'd these impu∣tations;
for none of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Commentators have given the rea∣son
why she proposes that exercise in particular; and therefore see∣ing
no reason for it, they have invented a false one, and give the
story a ridiculous air: I flatter my self that a better solution
may be found out, and a reason given why <HI>Penelope</HI> proposes this
exercise in particular, and preferably to any other.</P>
<P>We are to remember that this day was sacred to <HI>Apollo;</HI> this
is evident from the preceding book, where the <HI>Ithacans</HI> offer an
Hecatomb in a grove consecrated to that Deity: The diversion
suits the day, the exercise of the bow being proper to be
practised on the festival of that Deity, who is the patron of it.
Several of the titles of <HI>Apollo</HI> are derived from it; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
It is strange that this necessary ob∣servation
should escape the notice of all Commentators.</P>
<P>If any thing further were wanting to reconcile us to the con∣duct
of <HI>Penelope</HI> in proposing the Bow, an instance almost paral∣lel
to it might be produced from History. When <HI>Cambyses</HI> was
preparing to make war against <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> the King of that coun∣try
bent his great bow with two fingers in the presence of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Ambassadors, and unbending it again, deliver'd it to them
with these words: That when the <HI>Persians</HI> could do the like, they
might hope to conquer the <HI>Aethiopians.</HI> There is nothing more
absurd in the delivery of the bow to the Suitors by <HI>Penelope,</HI> than
in the same act of the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> King to the <HI>Persian</HI> Ambas∣sadors.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 9. <HI>A brazen key she held,</HI> &amp;c.] The numerous par∣ticularities
and digressive Histories crowded together in the be∣ginning
of this book have not escap'd censure. The Poet very
circumstantially describes the key, and the make of it, as like∣wise
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
the bow and quiver, then tells us who gave it to <HI>Ulysses;</HI>
at the mention of the donor's name he starts into a little History
of him, and returns not in many lines to his subject; he then
no less circumstantially describes the chamber, and the frame of
the door, he descends to every particular of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s opening it,
and every step and motion she takes till she produces the bow be∣fore
the Suitors. This conduct has been liable to objection, as
made up of particulars of small importance, to no propos'd end.
But notwithstanding, every circumstance is not without its effect
and beauty, and nothing better shows the power of the Poet's
diction. So great a Critic as <HI>Vida</HI> admir'd this very passage.
<HI>Poetic. lib.</HI> 2.
<Q><L>Ipsa procos etiam ut jussit certare sagittis</L>
<L>Penelope, optatas promittens callida taedas</L>
<L>Victori, per quanta morae dispendia mentes</L>
<L>Suspensas trahit, ante viri quam proferet arcum?</L></Q>
The Poet adapts his verse to the nature of his subject;
the description loiters, to express the studied delay of <HI>Pe∣nelope,</HI>
and her unwillingness to bring affairs to a decision. How∣ever
I will not promise that these digressions and ancient hi∣stories
will please every Reader; the passage is so far from being
faulty, that it is really an instance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s judgment; yet
every thing that is not a fault, is not a beauty. The case is,
<HI>Penelope</HI> proposes the tryal of the bow, merely to protract time
from the nuptials; she is slow in producing it for the same rea∣son;
and <HI>Homer,</HI> to paint this slowness in a lively manner, lets the
subject of the Poem stand still, and wanders out of the way,
that he may not come too soon to the end of his journey.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 21. Messena'<HI>s state,</HI> &amp;c.] It has been disputed
whether <HI>Messene</HI> here was a city or a country; <HI>Strabo</HI> affirms it
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
to be a country, <HI>lib.</HI> 8. It was a port of <HI>Laconia,</HI> under the
dominion of <HI>Menelaus</HI> in the time of the war of <HI>Troy;</HI> and
then (continues that Author) the city named <HI>Messene</HI> was not
built. <HI>Pausanias</HI> is of the same opinion, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 1. “Before
the battle of <HI>Leuctra</HI> between the <HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
it is my judgment that there was no City called <HI>Messene;</HI>
this is evident from the words of <HI>Homer,</HI>”
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
Now <HI>Ortilochus</HI> lived in <HI>Pherae,</HI> a city of <HI>Messenia,</HI> and conse∣quently
<HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Iphitus</HI> meeting at his Palace in <HI>Messenia, Ho∣mer</HI>
must mean the country, not the city. That <HI>Ortilochus</HI> lived
in <HI>Pherae,</HI> appears from the third <HI>Odyssey.</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
This <HI>Iphitus</HI> was the son of <HI>Eurytus</HI> mention'd in the eighth
book, famous for his skill in archery.
<Q><L><HI>Vain</HI> Eurytus! <HI>whose art became his crime,</HI></L>
<L>Swept from the earth, he perish'd in his prime,</L>
<L>Sudden th' irremeable way he trod,</L>
<L>Who boldly durst defy the Bawyer God.</L></Q>
So that even this digression is not foreign to the purpose: The
Poet largely describes the bow, being to make great use of it in the
sequel of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> he shews it was originally in the possession of
<HI>Eurytus,</HI> the most famous archer in the world: Nay, this very di∣gression
may appear to be absolutely necessary; it being requisite
to describe that bow, as of no common excellence and strength,
which was not to be drawn by any of the Suitors; and at the
same time it sets off the strength of the Heroe of the Poem, who
alone is able to bend it.</P>

<P>VERSE 22. <HI>Three hundred sheep,</HI> &amp;c.] It has been observ'd
in a former annotation, that such ravages or pyracies were not
only lawful but honourable amongst the Ancients; why then is
<HI>Ulysses</HI> here sent to redemand the spoils made by the <HI>Messenians?
Dacier</HI> answers that such inroads were not allowable except in
open War; she means between <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Greeks;</HI> for they them∣selves
exercis'd such pyracies with impunity against other nations.</P>

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 31. <HI>Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rite transgrest.]
Homer</HI> very solemnly condemns this action of <HI>Hercules</HI> in slaying
<HI>Iphitus;</HI> and some Authors (remarks <HI>Eustathius</HI>) defend him by
saying, he was seiz'd with madness, and threw <HI>Iphitus</HI> down from
the top of his Palace; but this is contrary to <HI>Homer,</HI> and to
the sentiment of those who write that <HI>Hercules</HI> was deliver'd
as a slave to <HI>Omphale,</HI> for the expiation of the murder of <HI>Iphitus.</HI></P>
<P>But what chiefly wants explication is the expression
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L>'<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</L></Q>
That is, <HI>he paid no reverence to his Table.</HI> The Table was held
sacred by the Ancients, by means of which, honour was paid to
the God of Friendship and Hospitality: it was therefore a crime
to dishonour it by any indecent behaviour. To this purpose <HI>Ju∣venal:</HI>
<Q>Hic verbis nullus pudor, aut reverentia mensae.</Q>
The statues of the Gods were rais'd upon the tables, they were
consecrated by placing on them salt, which was always esteem'd
holy, and by offering libations to the Gods from them: the Ta∣ble
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
therefore is call'd in <HI>Plutarch</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>the altar of the Gods of Friendship and Hospitality;</HI> and therefore to
have eaten at the same table, was esteem'd an inviolable obliga∣tion
of friendship: And <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to transgress a∣gainst
the table, a breach of the laws of hospitality, and the
blackest of crimes. I will only add that it was customary
upon making an alliance of hospitality to give mutual To∣kens;
thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> here presents <HI>Iphitus</HI> with a sword and spear;
<HI>Iphitus Ulysses</HI> with a bow. And the producing these tokens was
a recognition of the covenant of hospitality, between the persons
themselves, and their descendents in following generations.</P>

<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 51. <HI>Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring.]</HI> This
description presents us with a noble image; <HI>Homer</HI> introdu∣ces
it to shew the largeness and strength of the door, which re∣sounds

The Bow recalls to her mind the thought of her husband, and
this raises her sorrows. The least trifle that once belong'd to a
belov'd person, is sufficient to cast a cloud over the soul, which
naturally falls in a show'r of tears: And no doubt the exercise
which the Suitors are to practise with the Bow, upon which her
future fate depends, aggravates her sorrows; she weeps not only
for the loss of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but at the thought that she is ready to en∣ter
upon second nuptials, contrary to her inclinations.</P>

<P>VERSE 105. <HI>Then thus</HI> Telemachus. <HI>Some God I find,</HI> &amp;c.]
This speech is not without greater obscurity than is usual in so
clear a writer as <HI>Homer.</HI> M. <HI>Dacier</HI> has done it justice, and clear∣ly
open'd the sense of it in her paraphrase. “Surely, says <HI>Te∣lemachus,
Jupiter</HI> has disorder'd my understanding: I see my
mother, wise as she is, preparing to leave the palace, and en∣ter
upon a second marriage; and yet in these melancholy cir∣cumstances,
I think of nothing but diverting my self, and be∣ing
an idle spectator of this exercise of the Bow: No, no,
this is not to be suffer'd: You (the Suitors) use your utmost
efforts to rob me of <HI>Penelope,</HI> I will therefore use mine to re∣tain
her: A woman the most excellent in any nation. But
why do I praise her? you know her worth; use therefore no
pretext to defer the tryal of the Bow, that we may come to
an issue; I will try the Bow with you; and if I succeed, then
I will retain her as the prize of the conquest; then she shall
not be obliged to second nuptials: Nor will <HI>Penelope</HI> abandon
a son, who emulating his father, is (like him) able to bear the
prize from so many Antagonists.</P>
<P>This is the true meaning of the words of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> the di∣ction
indeed is somewhat embarrass'd, and the connections a lit∣tle
obscure; but this is done by the Poet, to express the disorder and
hurry of mind in <HI>Telemachus,</HI> who fears for the fate of <HI>Penelope:</HI>
Therefore the connection of the Periods is interrupted, to repre∣sent
<HI>Telemachus</HI> starting thro' eagerness of spirit from thought to

<P><Q><L>VERSE 135. <HI>The fourth had drawn it. The great Sire with joy</HI></L>

It is not apparent at the first view why <HI>Ulysses</HI> prohibits <HI>Telema∣chus</HI>
from drawing the Bow; but <HI>Eustathius</HI> gives sufficient reasons
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
for this conduct: It would have defeated his whole design, and
render'd the death of the Suitors impracticable; for <HI>Telemachus</HI> had
declar'd that he would retain <HI>Penelope,</HI> if he succeeded in the exercise
of the Bow; and this of necessity would create an immediate contest
between that Heroe and the Suitors, and bring matters unseason∣ably
to extremity. The same author assigns a second reason; <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
fears lest <HI>Telemachus</HI> by bending the Bow should make it more
supple and flexible, and therefore commands him to desist, lest
it should be drawn by the Suitors; besides, if he had drawn it,
it would have rais'd an emulation amongst them, and they would
have apply'd the utmost of their abilities not to be outdone by
so young a person as <HI>Telemachus;</HI> but his despair to effect it, makes
them less sollicitous, the tryal being equally unsuccessful to
them all.</P>
<P>It may also be observ'd that there is a very happy address made
to <HI>Telemachus</HI> by <HI>Homer;</HI> He shews us that he could have drawn
it, but desists in obedience to <HI>Ulysses:</HI> Thus the Poet has found
out a way to give <HI>Telemachus</HI> the Honour of the Victory with∣out
obtaining it; and at the same time shews the superior wisdom
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who restrains his son in the heat of his attempt; and
makes him by a happy presence of mind at once foresee the dan∣ger,
and prevent it.</P>

tells us, sate next to the bowl; the reason of it, saith <HI>Eustathius,</HI>
was because the Suitors fear'd lest poison should be mix'd in it,
and they thought themselves safe thro' his care and inspection:
but it may perhaps be a better reason to say, that he sate there
in dischage of his office as a Prophet, to make libations to the

<P><PB N="92" REF="91"/>
The Poet adds that this Prophet was placed at the extremity
of the apartment; the reason may be because he was an enemy
to the insolence of the Suitors, and therefore withdrew from their
conversation; or perhaps the word is inserted only to shew that
his place was the first (for <HI>Eustathius</HI> explains <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and therefore he was the most proper

<P>This <HI>Leiodes</HI> falls by the sword of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the next book;
but is it not injustice to take away the life of a Person who is
here describ'd as a man of virtue, detesting the actions of the
Suitors, and dignisy'd with Prophecy? It is easie to answer this
objection; he is one of the Suitors to <HI>Penelope,</HI> as appears from
his trying the Bow amongst the rest of them, in order to ob∣tain
her in marriage, and consequently he is involv'd in the ge∣neral
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
crime: This distinguishes his case from that of <HI>Medon</HI>
and <HI>Phemius,</HI> whom <HI>Ulysses</HI> spares, it appearing that they made
no pretensions to the bed of <HI>Penelope;</HI> whereas <HI>Leiodes</HI> endea∣vours
to marry the Queen, which single act would exclude <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>

<P>VERSE 186. <HI>Chafe ev'ry knot, and supple ev'ry pore.]</HI> This
passage has been egregiously misunderstood, and it has been ima∣gin'd

make them more supple, after the manner of Wrestlers who ob∣serv'd
that custom; but it is very evident that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is to be un∣derstood
in the <HI>Greek,</HI> and that it is the Bow, not the Limbs of
the Suitors, that is to be anointed. <HI>Eustathius</HI> thus fully explains
it: The lard is brought to make the Bow pliant, they chafe it
before the fire that the particles of it may enter the pores of the
Bow and render it flexible. But <HI>Eustathius</HI> falls into an error
about the seat that is brought by <HI>Melanthius:</HI> he imagines the
Suitors sate while they drew the Bow, that they might be upon a
level with the ringlets which were fix'd upon the ground; whereas
in reality the seat is brought, that they may sit while they chafe the
Bow. <HI>Homer</HI> himself says, when <HI>Leiodes</HI> endeavours to draw it,
that he stood up, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and again,

<P><Q><L>VERSE 193. <HI>Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew</HI></L>
<L>The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.]</L></Q>
It is wonderful how exactly the Poet observes the distribution
of time; he distinctly marks the action of every day, and
allots a proper space to every action. In this place the Poem
goes forward while <HI>Ulysses</HI> withdraws to engage the assistance
of <HI>Philaetius</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> The Suitors are amus'd and em∣ploy'd
about the Bow, while <HI>Ulysses</HI> steals away from their
observation, and returns without raising their jealousy. The
Poet likewise manages the time of the discovery of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
very judiciously; tho' he knew the fidelity of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> and <HI>Phi∣laetius,</HI>
yet he trusts them not with the knowledge of his Per∣son,
till the very hour of execution; agreable to the general cha∣racter
of his cautious nature and profound secrecy. But then is
not this an imputation to <HI>Penelope,</HI> that he should chuse to disco∣ver
himself to these two persons, rather than to his Queen? The
answer is, There was a necessity for his discovery to the former,
but none to the latter; he wants their assistance in the future en∣gagement,
and makes good use of it; whereas a discovery made
to the Queen could have been of no advantage, and might possibly
have prov'd detrimental; besides, this is a season that requires
expedition; and we find <HI>Ulysses</HI> complies with it, and is very
concise in the discovery and interview with <HI>Philaetius</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus.</HI>
The Poet therefore reserves the discovery of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to <HI>Penelope</HI> to
a time of more leisure, that he may dwell upon it more largely,
and beautify his Poem with so essential an ornament with greater
solemnity.</P>

<P>VERSE 231.—<HI>and the scar expos'd.] Aristotle</HI> treating
of the different sort of <HI>Remembrances,</HI> Chap. 17. of his <HI>Poetics,</HI>
divides them into two kinds, <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>adventitious;</HI> the for∣mer
sort is simple and without art, which Poets use for want of
invention; as for instance, when they bring about the discovery
of a person by some natural mark or token upon the body: The
latter are either marks upon the body, as scars occasion'd by some
accident, or tokens distinct from the body, such as the Casket,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which <HI>Plautus</HI> and <HI>Terence</HI> use in the discovery of several
persons in their Comedies: Of this latter kind is this scar of <HI>Ulys∣ses;</HI>
it is an adventitious remembrance, and these remembrances
(continues <HI>Aristotle</HI>) may be us'd with more or less art: Thus in
the case of this wound of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> it is us'd by <HI>Homer</HI> in a diffe∣rent
way: <HI>Euryclea,</HI> Lib. 19. describes it accidentally; <HI>Ulysses</HI> here
shews it to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> and <HI>Philaetius</HI> voluntarily; and it is certain
that all those marks which a Poet designedly and deliberately uses
to establish any verity, have less ingenuity than those which pro∣duce
their effects undesignedly and casually, and consequently the
remembrance in the nineteenth <HI>Odyssey</HI> is more ingenious than
this second discovery. The reason is, it shews no ingenuity
to have recourse to such marks, when we have an intention to
make the discovery: it causes no surprize nor variety, neither
is it produc'd by any art or invention: On the contrary, the
other in the nineteenth book arises from the subject, and not
from the fancy of the Poet only. But, says <HI>Dacier,</HI> when <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
affirms that this present remembrance wants ingenuity, we
are not yet to imagine that he condemns it; for it is a remem∣brance
made by necessity. <HI>Ulysses</HI> has not opportunity to wait till
the discovery is made accidentally, as in the nineteenth Book; he
is absolutely compell'd to make it designedly, to engage <HI>Eumaeus</HI>
and <HI>Philaetius</HI> in his cause, by plainly proving to them that he
was the real <HI>Ulysses.</HI> If therefore that Heroe shews less art in the
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
manner of the remembrance, he shews more wisdom in accom∣modating
his conduct to the opportunity, and using the present
conjuncture advantageously, to bring about his own re-establish∣ment.
I will only further observe the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI>
in making this discovery with the utmost brevity, concluding it
in the compass of two verses: he had before enlarg'd upon the
wound, and the reader is already fully instructed in the story:
There is likewise another reason that requires conciseness; the
urgency of the time demands it, for <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> could
not be long in conference without observation, and raising the
jealousy of the Suitors.</P>

to obtain, arises from the pride of our natures, which
persuades us to endeavour to cheat the world into an opinion
that we have not been disappointed: The remedy for this di∣sease

<P>VERSE 274. <HI>Sacred to</HI> Phoebus <HI>is the solemn day.] Antinous,</HI>
in this reply, speaks, as well as <HI>Eurymachus,</HI> with dissimulation;
he is unwilling to give a true reason, and therefore invents a
false one: The true reason why he defers the tryal of the Bow
is, because he fears his inability to draw it: The feign'd reason
is a pretended piety paid to the day: it was a day to be ob∣serv'd
religiously, and he insinuates that all sports upon it are a
prophanation of it; and consequently, <HI>Apollo</HI> being provok'd,
disables them from drawing the Bow, of which he is the patron.
This is the reason why he proposes to offer a libation, to attone
for the abuse of the day by their diversions. But perhaps the
reason why <HI>Antinous</HI> defers the exercise of the Bow to the follow∣ing
day, is not because he thought it unlawful to proceed in it
on the festival of <HI>Apollo;</HI> for why should an exercise which was
instituted in honour of that Deity, be thought a prophanation
of the day? I should therefore rather conclude, that the impiety
intended by <HI>Antinous,</HI> was their omission in not offering a sacri∣fice
to that God before they begun the tryal, that he might pro∣sper
their endeavours: The conclusion of his speech makes this
opinion probable: “Let us now defer the experiment, and
offer sacrifice in the morning to <HI>Apollo,</HI> that he may give
us success in drawing the Bow;” which implies that they were
unsuccessful because they had forgot to sacrifice. I will only add
that <HI>Antinous</HI> mentions a goat as an offering to <HI>Apollo;</HI> we have
before seen bulls, sheep and bullocks offer'd to that Deity; the
reason why a goat is a proper victim, I suppose is because he is a
rural God, and patron of shepherds, and therefore all kinds of
beasts were offer'd to him promiscuously.</P>

This answer of <HI>Penelope</HI> is very severe and very just: <HI>Eurymachus</HI> (ob∣serves

lose our reputation: <HI>Penelope</HI> answers, It is in vain to be sollici∣tous

actions: Fame is the reward of good, and shame the por∣tion
of base and unworthy deeds: It is no dishonour to a Prince
to be surpass'd by a Beggar in strength, but a Prince is more in∣famous
than a Beggar, if his actions betray him to be a worse

they think to be none; they prey upon a King, who was a

deeds, and yet apprehend no discredit. This is an unhappy, and
I wish it were an unjust, picture of human nature; we deceive

He tells <HI>Penelope</HI> that the Bow shall be used as he directs; this is
done to intimidate the Suitors, and prepare the way for the de∣livery
of it to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> contrary to their injunctions to <HI>Eumaeus.</HI></P>
<P>The verses are the same with those in the 6th of the <HI>Iliad.</HI>
There <HI>Hector</HI> speaks to <HI>Andromache,</HI> a tender husband to a fond wife,
and the speech was never tax'd with any want of love and kind∣ness.
In that place <HI>Hector</HI> remembers that he is an husband, yet
forgets not that he is an Heroe. In this, <HI>Telemachus</HI> deviates not
from the duty of a son, yet speaks in the character and style
of a Prince.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> excellently enlarges upon the words of <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
There is an absolute necessity that <HI>Penelope</HI> should withdraw, that
she might not be present at the scene of blood and slaughter.
It is for the same reason that the Poet introduces <HI>Minerva</HI>
casting her into a profound sleep, that she might be entirely
ignorant of the death of the Suitors: This is absolutely neces∣sary;
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
for if she had been acquainted that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was return'd, and
the Suitors slain by his hand, there could have been no room for
the interview between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> in the succeeding parts
of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P>But is not <HI>Minerva</HI> introduc'd upon too small an occasion,
only to cast <HI>Penelope</HI> into a slumber? would not nature have work'd
the same effect without the assistance of the Goddess? I have al∣ready
remark'd that machines are not always used out of necessity,
but frequently for ornament, to dignify the Poetry and create
surprise by the appearance of a Deity. But here the Poet brings
down <HI>Minerva,</HI> to give credibility to the story; for tho' it be
true that nature is sufficient to produce this effect, yet that it
should operate in the critical and exact moment, when the Poet
has occasion for it, is in some degree incredible: The Poet there∣fore,
to reconcile the relation to probability, introduces a praeter-natural
sleep, occasion'd by the immediate operation of a God∣dess.</P>

This little particularity is not inserted in vain: <HI>Ulysses</HI> is ready
to engage in a terrible combat; it is therefore very necessary to
be curious in the examination of the Bow, to be certain that
he might depend upon it; if he had observ'd that it had been
decay'd thro' time, his prudence would have furnish'd him with
some other instrument. <HI>Eustathius</HI> is of opinion that this whole
Bow was made of horn, because <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> denotes worms that breed
in horn: The Bow, says that Author, was made of horn, and
not of wood, like the <HI>Scythian</HI> bows. This, it must be confess'd,
is not entirely satisfactory, because the bows were anciently tipt
or pointed at the extremities with horn; and to this horn <HI>Ulysses</HI>

very just, and well suited to the purpose; the strings of the lyre repre∣sent
the bow-string, and the ease with which the Lyrist stretches
them, admirably paints the facility with which <HI>Ulysses</HI> draws the
bow. When similitudes are borrow'd from an object entirely dif∣ferent

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
TWENTY-SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are now come to the great event or Ca∣tastrophe
of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> which is the De∣struction
of the Suitors. The manner by
which the Poet conducts it, has been prais'd
and censur'd, by some as noble and heroic,
by others as romantic and incredible: It is
therefore highly necessary to vindicate <HI>Homer</HI>
in the chief action of the whole Poem, that
he may not be found culpable, in the place where he ought to
be the most exact and draw his Heroe to the best advantage.
The Objection made against this decisive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action is, that the Poet
makes <HI>Ulysses</HI> perform impossibilities; no one person, with such
small assistance, being able to destroy above an hundred Enemies.
It is no answer to say that <HI>Pallas</HI> descends to aid <HI>Ulysses,</HI> for it
has been already proved, that all incidents which require a divine
probability, should be so disengag'd from the action, that they
may be substracted from it without destroying it; whereas this
action is essential to it. No less a Critic than <HI>Longinus,</HI> Chap. 7.
<PB N="140" REF="139"/>
condemns <HI>Homer;</HI> for enumerating the faults of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> he
thus proceeds: “To these may be added the absurdities he com∣mits,
in the account of the destruction of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s Suitors.”
And <HI>Scaliger,</HI> Lib. 5. of his <HI>Poetics</HI> is of the same opinion:
<HI>Ulysses interfecit arcu procos, inter quos &amp; ipsum tantillum esset in∣tervalli:
Quare omnes simul in eum impetum non fecerunt?</HI> The
strength of this Objection lies in the omission of the Suitors in
not rushing at once upon <HI>Ulysses</HI> in an united Body: Now this
was impossible, he stood upon the threshold in a narrow pass,
and by this advantage he was able to make it good against a
great inequality of numbers. It is not difficult to bring instances
of a like nature from undoubted history: <HI>Cocles</HI> alone defended
the bridge over the <HI>Tyber</HI> against the whole army of <HI>Porsena,</HI> and
stood unmoveable till the <HI>Romans</HI> broke it down behind him.
And <HI>Leonidas</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> General defended the Pass of <HI>Thermopylae</HI>
with a small number, against three millions of <HI>Persians</HI> led by
<HI>Xerxes;</HI> and if he had not been betray'd, he would have pro∣bably
defeated his whole army. In both these instances there
was a greater inequality of numbers, than between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and
the Suitors. The Reader will be reconcil'd to the probability of
these relations, if he considers that the whole business of war was
anciently decided by mere strength of body: Fire-arms now set
all men upon a nearer Level; but in these early ages, the strong∣est
person was the greatest Heroe; a man of superior and un∣common
strength drove his enemies before him like an army of
boys, and with as much facility. From this observation it is evi∣dent
that <HI>Homer</HI> scarce transgresses the bounds of historic truth,
when he describes <HI>Achilles</HI> chasing whole squadrons of <HI>Trojans:</HI>
He wrote according to the manners of his times, and drew after
the life, tho' sometimes he improv'd a feature to give grace to
the picture of his Heroe: Thus in the Scripture, from the mere
advantage of strength, we see a single <HI>Goliah</HI> defy the whole armies
of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rapin</HI> commends the conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in bringing about the
destruction of the Suitors. The unravelling the whole <HI>Odyssey</HI>
(says that Author) by their Deaths, is very great, and very becom∣ing
<PB N="141" REF="140"/>
an Heroe; that whole story is dress'd up in colours so decent,
and at the same time so noble, that antiquity can hardly match
any part of the narration; here <HI>Homer</HI> has display'd himself to
the best advantage. I wish <HI>Rapin</HI> had given his reasons, and
not run into a general commendation: But we shall be suf∣ficiently
convinc'd of the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI> in describing the
Suitors falling chiefly by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> if we consider the nature of
Epic Poetry. The chief action is to be peform'd by the Heroe
of the Poem: thus <HI>Hector</HI> falls by <HI>Achilles, Turnus</HI> by <HI>Aeneas:</HI>
The death of the Suitors is the chief action of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and
therefore it is necessarily to be executed by <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for if any
other person had perform'd it, that person would have done an
action more noble than the Heroe of the Poem, and eclips'd his
glory. It is for the same reason that the Poet refuses all easie
methods to re-establish <HI>Ulysses:</HI> he throws him into difficulties
which he is to surmount by his own prowess and magnanimity.
<HI>Homer</HI> might easily have rais'd an army, and plac'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> at the
head of it; but the more difficult way being most conducive to
his honour, he rejects all easie methods, shews him struggling
with infinite hazards, out of which he extricates himself perso∣nally
by his wisdom and courage. By these means he com∣pleats
the character of his Heroe, leaves a noble image of his
worth upon the minds of the Spectators, and makes him go
off the stage with the utmost applause.</P>

you repeat the verses of <HI>Homer</HI> emphatically, and ravish the

how <HI>Ulysses</HI> leaps upon the threshold, discovers himself to the

be allow'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> here paints to the Life; we see <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
his motion, his attitude, and the noble fury with which he begins
the onset. The Poet interests us in the cause of his Heroe, and

words, in compliance with the exigence of the time, which will
not permit him to speak at large. This prayer to <HI>Apollo</HI> con∣firms
my observation, that <HI>Penelope</HI> propos'd the tryal of the

It is from the urgency of the time that the speech of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> as

is in doubt of the great event, and stands still in admiration of
it. This has a double effect; it sets the courage of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in a

an impossibility; and at the same time it excellently contributes
to make the story credible; for <HI>Homer</HI> appears to be held in su∣spense

<P>VERSE 64. <HI>To slay thy son, thy kingdoms to divide.]</HI> This ex∣pression
is judiciously inserted, and with good reason put into
the mouth of one of the Suitors, namely <HI>Eurymachus.</HI> The Poet
is now punishing them for their crimes; it is therefore very ne∣cessary
that the Reader should be satisfy'd that they deserve pu∣nishment;
for if it be not an act of justice, it is murder. The
Poet therefore brings them all confessing themselves guilty by the
mouth of <HI>Eurymachus;</HI> their crime is the intended murder of <HI>Te∣lemachus,</HI>
and the usurpation of the throne of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> If this had
not been set in a clear light, there might have been room for a
suspicion that <HI>Ulysses</HI> inflicted a punishment too great for the guilt
of the Suitors. For was it a crime that deserv'd death, to aim at
the marriage of <HI>Penelope?</HI> this is not to be suppos'd; for they
took her to be a widow, and might therefore without a crime
ask her in marriage. Was death due for the waste and profusion
of the riches of <HI>Ulysses?</HI> This might have been redress'd, by a full
repayment, and a just equivalent. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore, to shew that
there is a cause for the severity of the punishment, sets their
crimes in open view, which are an intentional murder, and an
actual treason. The place likewise where he inserts this circum∣stance
is well chosen, <HI>viz.</HI> in the place where the punishment is
related; and by this method we acknowledge the equity of it.
'Tis true, <HI>Eurymachus</HI> throws the guilt upon <HI>Antinous</HI> as the chief
offender; but all the Suitors have been his associates, and approv'd
of all his violent and bloody designs thro' the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and there∣fore
are justly involv'd in the same punishment; so that <HI>Ulysses</HI>
punishes rebellious subjects by the authority of a King. <HI>Homer</HI>
likewise observes justice in the death of <HI>Antinous;</HI> he is the first
in guilt, and the first that falls by his Heroe's hands.</P>

<P>VERSE 108. <HI>The brazen weapon driving thro' his back.] Eusta∣thius,</HI>
and <HI>Spondanus</HI> from him, interpret this passage very much
to the disadvantage of the courage of <HI>Telemachus:</HI> They observe
that he is yet new to the horrors of war, and therefore wanting
the heart to meet his enemy in the front, gives him this wound
between the shoulders: That as soon as he has given the blow,
out of fear he leaves the spear in the wound; an action as disre∣putable,
as to throw away the shield in battle; and lastly, that
it is fear that suggests to his mind the expedient to fetch the arms,
a pretext to be distant from danger. But it is not difficult to
defend <HI>Telemachus. Amphinomus</HI> was assaulting <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and conse∣quently
his back was turn'd towards <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and this occasi∣ons
the wound in that part. This combat is not a combat of
<PB N="147" REF="146"/>
honour, where points of ceremony are observ'd; <HI>Telemachus</HI> was
therefore at liberty to destroy his enemy by any methods, with∣out
any imputation of cowardice; especially considering the ine∣quality
of the parties. Neither is it out of fear that he quits his
spear; but from a dictate of wisdom; he is afraid lest some of
the Suitors should attack him while he is disengaging it, and take
him at an advantage, while he has no weapon to use in his own
defence; besides, he has no farther occasion for it, he hastes
away to provide other arms; not only for himself, but for <HI>Ulysses</HI>
and his friends; and this is so far from being the suggestion of
fear, that it is the result of wisdom.</P>
<P>There is some difficulty in the expression <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the

used a little lower. It has given great trouble to the Com∣mentators

imagines that by the former there was a descent into the court∣yard,
and so to the street; but this cannot be true: For <HI>Agelaüs</HI>
exhorting his associates to seize this passage, makes use of the word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies to <HI>ascend,</HI> and not to <HI>descend</HI> into the
court-yard: Besides, he bids them raise the people by <HI>shouting
to them,</HI> which seems to imply, that this place overlook'd the
streets, from whence a shout might be heard by the people. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
(observes <HI>Eustathius</HI>) is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
that is, <HI>a door by which a person ascends to obtain a prospect:</HI> This
probably led to the roof of the porch of the palace fronting the
street, from whence a person standing in the open air and shout∣ing
might raise the City; or as for greater clearness it is here
translated a window, which answers all these purposes.</P>
<P>But there is still a difficulty arising from the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which is thus solv'd by <HI>Eustathius,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
that is, a narrow passage leading to this pri∣vate
window or door, and he afterwards interprets it by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="148"/>
From what has been observ'd, it appears evidently that there
was another passage to the upper apartments of the palace; for
this was guarded by <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> and was inaccessible, and conse∣quently
<HI>Melanthius</HI> conveys the arms to the Suitors by some other
stair-case. This <HI>Homer</HI> expresses by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; the
former word is very well explain'd by <HI>Hesychius,</HI> it signifies the
passages of the palace leading from chamber to chamber, or the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the apartments. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> properly denotes a rupture, and
here represents the openings of the passages from room to room.
The Ancients thought this whole passage so obscure, that they
drew a plan of these inward passages of the palace, as <HI>Eustathius</HI>
informs us; in this they figur'd the porch, the higher aperture,
the other stair-case, and the room where the arms were laid. But
<HI>Dacier</HI> starts another difficulty: If <HI>Melanthius</HI> could go up to the
room where the arms lay, why could he not go from thence into
the courts of the palace, and raise the city? The answer is, because
the arms were plac'd in an inward apartment, and there was no
passage from thence into the palace-yards. Her mistake arose from
her opinion that there was an entry into the palace by the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which opinion is refuted in the beginning of this annota∣tion.
If indeed <HI>Telemachus</HI> had brought down the arms this
way, then there must have been a passage for <HI>Melanthius</HI> to the
place from whence <HI>Agelaus</HI> bids him raise the city; for if <HI>Tele∣machus</HI>
had pass'd to the armory by it, why might not <HI>Melanthius</HI>
from it? But this is not the case; for this door or window is not
mention'd till <HI>Telemachus</HI> has furnish'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his Friends
with armour; and consequently <HI>Homer</HI> cannot intend that we

spoke with a low voice, and at a proper distance from <HI>Ulysses.</HI>
It may also be objected that <HI>Melanthius</HI> could not possibly bring
the arms without the observation of <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his friends. To
solve this difficulty we must have recourse to the second private
door, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, mention'd in a former annotation; by this
passage he ascends and descends without a discovery; that passage
standing in such a situation, as not to be visible to those who
were on the opposite side of the palace. What may seem to con∣tradict
this observation is, what <HI>Homer</HI> afterwards adds, for he di∣rectly
tells us, that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> observ'd that the person who brought
the arms was <HI>Melanthius;</HI> but that expression may only imply,

action of his whole Poem: Thus <HI>Jupiter</HI> assists <HI>Aeneas</HI> in
<HI>Virgil; Minerva, Achilles</HI> in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the same Goddess <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
here in the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> I very well know that all these passages
have been blam'd by some Critics, as derogatory to the courage
of these Heroes, who cannot conquer their enemies but thro' the
assistance of a Deity. The Reader may be pleas'd to look back

<P>We may observe that a Deity descends to assist <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but that
the Suitors are left to their own Conduct: This furnishes us with
a very just and pious moral, and teaches us that Heaven guards

<P>This perhaps may be the occasion of all such fictions. The
superstition of the heathen world induc'd the Ancients to believe
that the appearance of any Bird in a critical hour, was a sign of
the presence of a Divinity, and by degrees they began to
persuade themselves, that the Gods appear'd to them in the
form of those birds. Hence arose all the honours paid to Au∣gurs,
and the reliance upon divination drawn from the flight of
birds; and almost every Deity had a bird sacred to him. The

in search of foreign ornaments, beautifies and enlivens the hor∣rors
of it with two similitudes, drawn from subjects very distant
from the terrors they are brought to illustrate. The former of an
herd of cattle, represents the confusion and affright of the Sui∣tors;
the latter of the birds, their weakness and unavailing flight.
The Gadfly shews the fury and close pursuit of <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his
assistants, the Hawks their courage, and superior pow'r. <HI>Eustathius.
Virgil</HI> at large describes this breeze-fly. <HI>Georg.</HI> 3.
<Q><L>About th' <HI>Alburnian</HI> groves, with holly green,</L>
<L>Of winged insects mighty swarms are seen:</L>

<L>Oestros <HI>the</HI> Grecians <HI>call,</HI> Asylus, <HI>we:</HI></L>
<L>A fierce loud buzzing Breeze: their stings draw blood;</L>
<L>And drive the cattle gadding thro' the wood,</L>
<L>Seiz'd with unusual pains they loudly cry, <HI>&amp;c. Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
This description shews that this is no ill-chosen similitude; it ve∣ry
well paints the Suitors flying in an herd, and <HI>Ulysses</HI> wounding
them as they fly.</P>
<P>The latter simile from the Hawks, affords some curiosity in regard
to the antient manner of that sport. It is evident, says <HI>Dacier,</HI>
that this passage is an instance, that flying of birds of prey, in the
nature of our hawking, was practis'd by the Ancients: The nets,
call'd by <HI>Homer</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, were fix'd in the plain ground; the
fowlers with their falcons took their station upon the adjoining
eminences; when the birds, driven from this rising ground, flew
to the plain, they met with the nets, and endeavouring to escape
them, crowded into flocks; Then the Hawk or Vultur was
loos'd, and descending upon his prey, slew them in multitudes;
for the birds were incapable of resisting, and at the same time
were afraid of the nets, and therefore could not escape: This is
the reason why the fowlers are said to rejoice at the sport: A
plain indication, that the Poet intended to describe the sportman's
flying his bird at the prey. That the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <HI>Nets,</HI>
is evident from <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>I
swear by my nets: Hesychius</HI> is of the same opinion, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says
that Author, signifies the <HI>Clouds,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Hunters
Nets. Eustathius</HI> directly affirms, that in his time this sport
was practis'd in many countries; and the place where the nets
were fixed was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. That Author construes these
words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as if <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were to be understod, to
express the rushing of the birds against the net; but there is no
occasion for this violence to the text, for by joining <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the period will be plain, and signify, that thro' fear
of the net they fly with violence to avoid it. Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI>
has a pretty observation upon this sport; and shews us that the
<PB N="156" REF="155"/>
Ancients were used to take even deer with nets, by flying at them
birds of prey, in conformity to this description of <HI>Homer:</HI> This
is manifest from a passage in <HI>Arrian, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 1. where he speaks
of men placing their fears where they have nothing to fear:
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; “For what
remains, we are like deer, for they fearing the birds that are
flown at them, what course do they take? To what place of
refuge do they run to be in security? To the nets, and so pe∣rish,
mistaking their danger for their greatest safety.” <HI>Minerva</HI>
in this similitude is the bird of prey descending from the moun∣tain,
for she it is who scatters the Suitors by displaying her <HI>Aegis</HI>
from the roof of the palace: This is the opinion of <HI>Eustathius:</HI>
But in the winding up of the comparison, <HI>Homer</HI> plainly by the
vultur denotes <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his assistants (tho' perhaps not ex∣clusively
of the Goddess) for in the application he writes:

These Altars were places of sanctuary, and by flying to them
the person was thought to be under the immediate protection of
the Deity, and therefore in some cases inviolable. The same
practice prevail'd amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> for we find frequently in
the scriptures that it was customary to fly to the Altar as to a
place of refuge, which is evident from the expression of laying
hold on the horns of the Altar. This is the reason why <HI>Phe∣mius</HI>
entertains an intention to fly to the Altar of <HI>Jupiter Hercaeus.
Plutarch</HI> in his treatise upon Music, informs us, that <HI>Demodocus</HI>

himself, who was Author of two Poems, the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the

he had of the great qualifications that were necessary to form a
good Poet. He must sing of men and Gods; that is, be tho∣roughly

must be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>self-taught;</HI> that is, as we express it,
he must be a Genius; he must have a natural ability, which is
indeed to be improv'd, but not capable of being learn'd, by study:
He adds, that besides this felicity of nature, he must have an
heavenly inspiration; this implies that he must have a kind of
enthusiasm, an elevation of soul which is not to be obtain'd by

Hemistic <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as an instance that natural are
more excellent than acquir'd abilities; he gives the reason of it;
namely, because they are more uncommon, and not to be ob∣tain'd
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
by human industry. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> has a criticism up∣on
it. How (objects that Author) can it be said that the Poet
is self-taught, if the Gods teach him to sing? The answer is easy,
<HI>Homer</HI> means that he has no human instructor, and only oppo∣ses
natural to acquir'd abilities. It is observable that <HI>Maximus
Tyrius</HI> erroneously quotes the verse. <HI>Dissert.</HI> 22. for he writes,

<P>What <HI>Homer</HI> adds after all this, to raise the character of his
Poet, is very remarkably moral. That he never turned his

<L>Drive to yon' court—]</L></Q>
It would in these ages, observes <HI>Dacier,</HI> be thought barbarous in
a King to command his son to perform an execution of so much hor∣rour:
but antiently it was thought no dishonour: Thus in the
Scriptures <HI>Gideon</HI> having taken <HI>Zeba</HI> and <HI>Salmana,</HI> two <HI>Midian</HI>
Kings, commands his son to kill them with the sword in his pre∣sence:
But, continues that author, I wish <HI>Homer</HI> had deviated
from this custom, that he had given both <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI>
sentiments of more humanity, and spar'd his Reader a description
of such a terrible execution. I am not delighted with any thing
that has a tendency to Inhumanity more than that Lady; but it
may be answer'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> was obliged to write according to
the custom of the age. <HI>Virgil</HI> has ascrib'd an act more cruel to
the pious <HI>Aeneas,</HI> who sacrifices several unfortunate young men
who were his captives. <HI>Aen.</HI> 11. <HI>v.</HI> 15.
<Q><L>Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear</L>
<L>Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear;</L>
<L>Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,</L>
<L>To sprinkle with their blood the funeral flame. <HI>Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
This act is to be ascrib'd to the manner of the age, and the cu∣stoms
of war in the days of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and not to his inhumanity:
But here it may seem essential to the very nature of Epic Poetry to
relate this act of justice: The moral of it is, to see the good re∣warded
and the wicked punished, in the conclusion of the Fable.
These criminals had been as guilty in their several capacities
<PB N="165" REF="164"/>
as the Suitors themselves; it was therefore necessary that their
punishment should be set before the Reader, as well as that of
the Suitors.</P>

<P>VERSE 505. <HI>Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare.</HI>]
Nothing can better represent to us the Image of these sufferers
than this similitude of a bird taken by the neck in a gin or snare.
<HI>Hobbs</HI> in his version has omitted it; and <HI>Dacier</HI> has abridg'd
the whole description.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> is pleasant upon the death of these wantons. What
a certain person, says he, once spoke of a fig-tree, on which
his clamorous wife had hang'd herself, <HI>viz. I wish all trees
bore such fruit;</HI> may be apply'd to these ropes, <HI>It were to be
wish'd that all nooses could catch such birds.</HI> This remark has
escap'd the notice of Madam <HI>Dacier;</HI> because the race of clamo∣rous
women has been long extinct, and therefore there was no
occasion to prescribe a remedy for a disease unknown to these
happy ages.</P>

<P>VERSE 527. <HI>Bring sulphur strait and fire</HI>—] The rea∣son
why <HI>Ulysses</HI> orders sulphur to be brought, is, because
every thing was thought to be polluted by a dead body,
and he uses it by way of purification. The same opinion
prevail'd amongst the <HI>Hebrews</HI> as well as <HI>Greeks,</HI> as the Scrip∣tures
inform us. Thus also in <HI>Job</HI> it is said, <HI>Brimstone shall be scat∣tered
upon his habitation.</HI> xviii. 15. which is thought to allude to
this custom. <HI>Livy</HI> mentions this practice amongst the <HI>Romans,

<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> forbids <HI>Eurcylea</HI> to bring a better Garment: this little par∣ticularity
is inserted with judgment; for the disguise of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in
the garb of a beggar contributes to encrease the incredulity of <HI>Pe∣nelope,</HI>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
TWENTY-THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS book contains the Discovery of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
to <HI>Penelope.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Rapin</HI> is very severe
upon some parts of it; whose objections I
shall here recite.</P>
<P>The discovery of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to his Queen
was the most favourable occasion imaginable
for the Poet to give us some of the nicest
touches of his art; but as he has manag'd
it, it has nothing but faint and weak surprizes, cold and lan∣guishing
astonishments, and very little of that delicacy and ex∣quisiteness
which ought to express a conjugal tenderness: He
leaves his wife too long in doubt and distrust, and she is too cau∣tious
and circumspect; the formalities she observes in being fully
assur'd, and her care to act with security, are set down in num∣ber
and measure, lest she should fall into any mistake; and this
particularity makes the story dull, in a place that so much requires
briskness and liveliness. Ought not the secret instinct of her love
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
to have inspir'd her with other sentiments? and should not her
heart have told her, what her eyes could not? Love is penetra∣ting,
and whispers more to us than the senses can convey; but
<HI>Homer</HI> understood not this Philosophy: <HI>Virgil,</HI> who makes <HI>Dido</HI>
foresee that <HI>Aeneas</HI> designs to leave her, would have made better
advantage of this favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>The strength of this objection consists chiefly in the long in∣credulity
of <HI>Penelope,</HI> and the slowness she uses to make an un∣deniable
discovery: This <HI>Rapin</HI> judges to be contrary to the passion
of love, and consequently that the Poet writes unnaturally.</P>
<P>There is somewhat of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> in this Criticism: <HI>Homer</HI>
in his opinion wants vivacity; and if <HI>Rapin</HI> had been to have
drawn <HI>Ulysses,</HI> we had seen him all transport and ecstasy. But
where there is most fancy, there is often the least judgment.
<HI>Penelope</HI> thought <HI>Ulysses</HI> to be dead; he had been absent twenty
years; and thro' absence and his present disguise, he was another
person from that <HI>Ulysses</HI> whom she knew, when he sail'd to <HI>Troy;</HI>
so that he was become an absolute stranger. From this observa∣tion
we may appeal to the Reader's judgment, if <HI>Penelope,</HI> with∣out
full conviction, ought to be persuaded that this person was
the real <HI>Ulysses?</HI> And how could she be convinc'd, but by asking
many questions, and descending to particularities, which must
necessarily occasion delay in the discovery? If indeed <HI>Ulysses</HI> and
<HI>Penelope</HI> had met after a shorter absence, when one view would
have assured her that he was her real husband, then too much
transport could not have been express'd by the Poet; but this is
not the case, she is first to know her husband, before she could
or ought express her fondness for his return, otherwise she might
be in danger of misplacing it upon an impostor: But she is no
sooner convinced that <HI>Ulysses</HI> is actually returned, but she receives
him with as much fondness as can be expressed, or as <HI>Rapin</HI>
could require.
<Q><L>While yet he speaks, her pow'rs of life decay,</L>
<L>She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away:</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="192"/>
At length recov'ring, to his arms she flew,</L>
<L>And strain'd him close, as to his breast she grew.</L></Q>
'Till this moment the discovery was not evidently made, and her
passion would have been unseasonable; but this is no sooner done,
but she falls into an agony of affection. If she had here ap∣pear'd
cool and indifferent, there had been weight in <HI>Rapin</HI>'s ob∣jections.
Besides, <HI>Aristotle</HI> informs us, that there was a Play,
call'd <HI>the False</HI> Ulysses: It was form'd upon a story of a person
who design'd to surprize <HI>Penelope,</HI> and told her, that he was her
husband; and to confirm it, pretended to remember a Bow,
which he used before he went to the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> This shews
that <HI>Penelope</HI> had been in danger from impostors, and it is there∣fore
very prudent in her to be upon the guard, and not to yield
without full conviction.</P>
<P>But there is a dispute of a different nature mention'd by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Bayle;</HI> namely, whether if <HI>Penelope</HI> had yielded to an impo∣stor,
believing him to be really <HI>Ulysses,</HI> she had been guilty of
adultery? Monsieur <HI>Basnage</HI> thus argues: “Let us suppose a
wife transported with love for an husband, running eagerly to
the person she mistakes for him: This woman has no design
to be deceived, one cannot blame her ardor; it is lawful, if he
proves her real husband: in short, her ignorance is involuntary,
and occasion'd solely by a laudable passion for her husband:
Yet, if this person prove an adulterer, is the wife entirely ex∣cusable?
ought her eagerness and precipitation to give her
no uneasiness? Undoubtedly it ought, because she is suppos'd to
act precipitately, without a full examination: her passion is
stronger than her reason, and therefore she is blameable.” The
Author of the General Critique on <HI>Maimbourg</HI> is more indul∣gent:
He judges that if a woman does not refuse a strict exami∣nation
out of a blameable motive, she is excusable, tho' she hap∣pens
to oblige an impostor. “If a wife, deceived by the re∣semblance
between her husband and an impostor, shall allow
the latter all the privileges of the marriage-bed, this action is
no stain to her chastity; and the husband would be the most
<PB N="196" REF="193"/>
unreasonable creature breathing, should he blame it as a breach
of conjugal fidelity, provided she is no way accessary to the
imposition.” So that according to this Author, tho' the wife
is betray'd by her precipitation, yet she is to be accounted inno∣cent;
because the precipitation is occasion'd by a vehemence of
love for her husband. But I fear few husbands who should take
their wives in such circumstances would excuse them, or believe
that they had us'd due circumspection. In short, Monsieur <HI>Bayle</HI>
rightly decides the question, by saying, that every person who
acts precipitately is culpable; and that no person can act ratio∣nally,
without a full and satisfactory examination. And indeed if
this rule were observ'd, there would scarce be any room for the afore∣said
supposition. The resemblance between man and man is never
so perfect, but the difference upon a strict observation is discernible;
we may therefore conclude, that a wife who should suffer such a
deceit, was not very unwilling to be deceiv'd; especially when there
must be between a man and wife a thousand particularities, which
could only be known to the wife and husband, which upon a
due scrutiny would discover the imposture.</P>
<P>I fear I shall be tedious to the Reader, by mentioning ano∣ther
difficulty of a similar nature started by <HI>Seneca.</HI> “If any
person should make an assignation with his own wife in dis∣guise,
supposing her to be the wife of another person, would
he be guilty of adultery?” He answers in the affirmative;
tho' the wife her self would be innocent; for he is guilty inten∣tionally.
This may be illustrated by the example of <HI>Jacob,</HI>
who was blameless when he was deceiv'd by <HI>Leah,</HI> who persona∣ted
his wife <HI>Rachel;</HI> but <HI>Leah</HI> was culpable, tho' <HI>Jacob</HI> was in∣nocent,
for she very well knew that she was not wife to <HI>Jacob.</HI>
But this is the province of a Casuist, not of a Commentator.</P>

<PB N="197" REF="194"/>
a person may be return'd to his country, and yet never ar∣rive
at his family: Thus <HI>Agamemnon</HI> reach'd his dominions in
safety, but was assassinated before he came to his Palace. We may
observe in general, that <HI>Euryclea</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> thro' their whole
conference speak with brevity; <HI>Homer</HI> was too good a judge of
human nature, to represent them speaking with prolixity. Passi∣on
is always in haste, and delivers itself with precipitation; and
this is very well painted in this interview: <HI>Euryclea</HI> is in a trans∣port
of joy for the return of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> has all her af∣fections
awaken'd at the news of it.</P>

This is an admirable sentiment: it is consonant to many expres∣sions

gives and takes away as seems best to his infinite wisdom. The
thoughts of man, as well as his life, are equally in the power of
the Almighty.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 21. <HI>Never did I a sleep so sweet enjoy,</HI> &amp;c.] <HI>Homer,</HI>
observes <HI>Eustathius,</HI> very judiciously mentions this profound sleep
of <HI>Penelope;</HI> for it might have been thought improbable, that
she should not wake at the noise and confusion of the battle. It
was solely to reconcile it to credibility, that in a preceding book
<HI>Pallas</HI> was introduced to throw her into it: besides, the womens
apartment was always in the upper part of the house, and was
from thence call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and consequently <HI>Penelope</HI> was at a
sufficient distance from the place of the combat, and may be
easily suppos'd not to be wak'd by it.</P>
<P>The circumstance of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s not being awak'd by the cries
of the Suitors, furnishes us with a reason why they are not heard
by the <HI>Ithacans</HI> that liv'd near the Palace: for if she who is with∣in
<PB N="198" REF="195"/>
in the Palace is not disturb'd by noise, it is credible enough,
that the <HI>Greeks</HI> who liv'd at some distance from the Palace should
not hear it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 35.—The Queen in transport sprung</L>
<L>Swift from the couch—]</L></Q>
We are not to gather from this transport of <HI>Penelope,</HI> that she is
fully convinc'd of the return of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> She is yet incredulous;
but she must have been insensible if she had continu'd unmov'd
at the mention of the arrival of an husband, whose return has
been describ'd thro' the whole <HI>Odyssey</HI> as the chief object of all
her desires. Besides, she receives the death of the Suitors with
joy; she cannot disbelieve the testimony of <HI>Euryclea</HI> concerning
their deaths; but thinking it impossible that they should be slain
by any one person, she ascribes their destruction not to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but
a Deity. But then is not such a supposition extravagant? and
can it be reconcil'd to probability, that a God should really be
suppos'd to descend to work their destruction? It may be an∣swer'd,
that the excess of the assertion ought to be ascrib'd to the
excess of joy in the speaker: <HI>Penelope</HI> is in a transport, and no
wonder if she speaks with amplification: she judges it impossible
that such a great event should be wrought by a mortal hand;
and it is therefore very natural, while she is under a surprize, and
her thoughts rais'd above the bounds of calm Reason, to ascribe
it to a Deity.</P>
<P>It has been believ'd that all the notions of good and bad Dae∣mons
that prevail'd among the Ancients were borrow'd from
truth, and that they received them by tradition from the offices
of good and bad Angels: If I might be allow'd to make this
supposition, then what <HI>Penelope</HI> here speaks may be reconcil'd to
strict verity; then we may find a reason why she may without
extravagance ascribe the Suitors deaths to a Daemon, or Deity.
Thus, 2 <HI>Kings, cap.</HI> xix. <HI>v. 35. That night the Angel of the Lord
went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred four∣score
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
and five thousand.</HI> If this supposition be thought disallow∣able,
the former will be a sufficient vindication. I will only add
that the Poet artfully turns the incredulity of <HI>Penelope</HI> to the
praise of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> the exploit was so great, that no mortal was
brave enough to perform it; it must therefore be wrought by
a God; but this God is at length discover'd to be <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 83. <HI>The works of Gods what mortal can survey?</HI>] This
assertion is made with great judgment. <HI>Euryclea</HI> had given almost
a demonstrative proof that she was not mistaken in the person
of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> she had instanced in the scar which he received by a
boar on mount <HI>Parnassus;</HI> and this seem'd to be an undeniable
evidence of her veracity: what method then could the Poet
take to carry on <HI>Penelope</HI>'s incredulity, and give her room to re∣sist
such evidence with any appearance of reason? This is very
well explain'd by <HI>Eustathius. Penelope</HI> (observes that Author) an∣swers
with profound wisdom; her words are short, but contain
excellent truth and morality: This is her meaning: “<HI>Euryclea,</HI>
you appeal to your senses for the truth of your affirmation:
you saw the wound, and touch'd it as you bath'd him; and
he forbad you to make a discovery of his person: from hence
you conclude, that it is <HI>Ulysses</HI> who has slain the Suitors; not
remembring that the Gods are able thus to shew themselves
to man, and assume at their pleasure such disguises: How then
do you know but this is a God? Are you able to know the
ways of a Deity?” To this <HI>Euryclea</HI> makes no reply; from
whence we may gather, that it was believ'd to be an undeniable
truth, that the divine Beings sometimes assum'd the shape of man,
and appear'd visibly upon earth. Such expressions as these might
almost persuade us of the reality of a former conjecture, that
these notions were borrow'd from a tradition of the appearances
of Angels; they being so consonant to the testimony of the holy
Scriptures, and so agreeable to the manifestations of those coele∣stial
Beings.</P>

<HI>Penelope</HI> apprehends that the person mentioned by <HI>Euryclea</HI> is not
<HI>Ulysses;</HI> yet her apprehensions are not so strong as to exclude all
hopes that he is her husband; in this state of uncertainty she de∣scends,
doubtful whether to meet him as such, or first to prove
him whether he be the real <HI>Ulysses;</HI> and this explains her conduct
in this place: If he evidently were <HI>Ulysses,</HI> she ought to receive
him with transport; but if he be not <HI>Ulysses,</HI> then all such advan∣ces
would be acts of immodesty, and a reproach to her prudence.
Ladies are best judges of what is decent amongst Ladies, and
Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> affirms, that the point of decency is well main∣tain'd
by <HI>Homer</HI> thro' this whole interview; and that Antiquity
can shew nothing wherein a severity of manners is better observ'd.
And indeed it must be allow'd that in this respect <HI>Penelope</HI> pro∣ceeds
with no more than a necessary caution; it would have been
very absurd to have describ'd her flying to the embraces of a
stranger, merely upon the testimony of <HI>Euryclea,</HI> without waiting
for a personal and ocular demonstration.</P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 93. <HI>The Monarch, by a column high enthron'd.</HI>] The
circumstance of persons of figure being plac'd by a column oc∣curs
frequently in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> it may therefore be necessary to ex∣plain
it: it is mention'd twice in the eighth book, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
but being there apply'd to <HI>Demodocus</HI> who was
blind, it may be thought to mean only that he lean'd against
the pillar by reason of his blindness: but this is not the full im∣port
of the words, they denote dignity; and a seat erected near
the column was a seat of distinction. Thus 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xi. 14.
<HI>Behold the King stood by a pillar,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>as the manner
was, and the Princes, &amp;c. by the King.</HI> Thus we see the Royal

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which probably is a <HI>corruption;</HI> it ought to be

<HI>And the King stood by a pillar, and made a covenant,</HI> &amp;c. So that
by this expression of <HI>Ulysses</HI> being seated by a column, we are
to understand that he receiv'd <HI>Penelope</HI> as a King; he took the
royal seat, to convince her that he was the real <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

We have all along been vindicating the conduct of <HI>Penelope,</HI> for
not immediately acknowledging <HI>Ulysses.</HI> Her ignorance of his per∣son
is her vindication; but how then is <HI>Ulysses</HI> to be justify'd,
who is in no doubt about <HI>Penelope?</HI> Why does not he fly with
transport to the wife of his affection? The reason is very evident:
he very well knows that <HI>Penelope</HI> is uncertain about his person;
he therefore forbears to offer violence to her modesty by any
caresses, while she is in this state of uncertainty, and which de∣cency
requires her to refuse, till she is assur'd that the person who
offers them is <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> turn'd his eyes toward the ground.
<HI>Eustathius</HI> imagines, that he does it that <HI>Penelope</HI> may not imme∣diately

than to draw <HI>Ulysses</HI> here, as he drew him in the <HI>Iliad, Lib.</HI> 3.

<P>VERSE 116. <HI>The garb of Poverty belies the King.</HI>] This ex∣pression
furnishes another cause for the incredulity of <HI>Penelope;
Ulysses</HI> imputes it to his disguise, and is far from resenting it as
a want of conjugal affection. I must confess, that here may seem
to be an unseasonable transition: <HI>Homer</HI> brings <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Pene∣lope</HI>
together, raises our expectations to see a warm and tender
description at the discovery of the husband to the wife, and all
of a sudden he starts from the subject, and leaves us under an
uncertainty equal to that of <HI>Penelope.</HI> The scene closes too ab∣ruptly,
and <HI>Homer</HI> acts like one who invites his guests to an en∣tertainment,
and when they were sate down with an eager ap∣petite,
takes away their dinner. But then it may be answer'd,
that the occasion presses: <HI>Ulysses</HI> finds it necessary to provide for
his own safety, before the people of <HI>Ithaca</HI> are inform'd of the
slaughter of the Suitors; this is the dictate of good sense; he first
acts the wise man, by guarding against an imminent danger;
and then shews the tender husband, by his affection to <HI>Penelope:</HI>
and this is the reason why he adjourns the discovery. Besides,
this interval, which is very short, gives time to <HI>Penelope</HI> to recol∣lect
her spirits from surprize, and makes her mistress of her own
thoughts. In that view the Reader is to look upon this break,
like a pause between the acts in a Tragedy, and as an artful in∣terruption
to introduce the unravelling more naturally, and with
greater probability.</P>

to have no reason to fear the resentments of the chief families of
his subjects, whose heirs were slain by his hand. I cannot en∣tirely
agree with <HI>Dacier</HI> in this last sentiment: <HI>Ulysses</HI> had only
done an act of justice upon these offenders, and had transgress'd no
law by it, and ought therefore to apprehend no vengeance from
the law. I should rather ascribe the apprehensions of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to a
fear of a sudden assault from the friends of the Suitors before he

<L>Lo! the Queen weds—]</L></Q>
This is an instance of the art of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> essential to his character,
and maintain'd thro' the whole <HI>Odyssey. Eustathius</HI> excellently ex∣plains
the reason of this conduct: The Suitors had been accusto∣med
to retire from the Palace, and sleep in other places by night:
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
it would therefore have alarm'd the whole city, and made them
apprehensive that some calamity had befallen them, if there had
not appeared a seeming reason why they return'd not to their se∣veral
houses as usual: <HI>Ulysses</HI> therefore invents this stratagem to
deceive them into an opinion that they stay'd to celebrate the
Queen's nuptials. But there appears to be a strong objection
against this part of the relation; we have already seen the Sui∣tors
slain, without being heard by the <HI>Ithacans</HI> of the city; is it
then probable that the sound of the music should be heard abroad,
when the cries, shouts and groans, during the fight were not heard
out of the Palace? Was the music louder than these united noises?
It is not easy to solve this difficulty, unless we are allow'd to ima∣gine
that the more than usual stay of the Suitors in the Palace
had rais'd the curiosity of some of the <HI>Ithacans</HI> to enquire the
reason of it; who consequently approaching the Palace might
hear the music and dancing, and conclude that it was occasion'd
by the Queen's marriage. Besides, in the stillness of the night, a
lower sound may be further heard, than one more loud, during
the noise and hurry of the day: it being evident from the pre∣ceding

she was so far from having time enough to know him,
that she had scarce spoke three words to him, but he bluntly
commands <HI>Euryclea</HI> to get the bed ready for them.” So that,
according to this Author, <HI>Penelope</HI> mistrusts his impatience; she
imagines the reason why he is so hasty, is because he fears that
a longer time would discover his imposture, and frustrate his
desires: And indeed if <HI>Ulysses</HI> had given such a command, the
objection had not been without a foundation. But <HI>La Mothe</HI> is
deceiv'd: <HI>Ulysses</HI> does not ask a bed for himself and <HI>Penelope,</HI> but

<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 183. <HI>Thus speaks the Queen, still dubious</HI>—] It must
be allow'd that this is a very artful turn of thought in <HI>Penelope.
Ulysses</HI> commands a bed to be prepar'd, <HI>Penelope</HI> catches the word,
and seeming to consent, orders <HI>Euryclea</HI> to carry the bed out of
the bridal apartment, and prepare it. Now this bed was of such a
nature as to be inwrought into the substance of the apartment
it self, and could not be remov'd; if therefore <HI>Ulysses</HI> had ac∣quiesc'd
in the injunction given by <HI>Penelope,</HI> and not discover'd the
impossibility of it, she might very justly have concluded him an
impostor, being manifestly ignorant of the secret of his own
marriage-bed.</P>
<P>But <HI>Eustathius</HI> starts an objection against this whole process
of the discovery, which he calls insolvible; and indeed if <HI>Homer</HI>
fails in the unravelling of his Poem, he is to be severely blam'd:
<HI>Tully</HI> is of this opinion, <HI>Illic enim debet toto animo a poetâ in disso∣lutionem
<PB N="208" REF="205"/>
nodi agi; eaque praecipua fabulae pars est, quae requirit dili∣gentiam.</HI>
The difficulty rais'd by <HI>Eustathius</HI> is as follows: <HI>Pene∣lope</HI>
imagines that the person who pretends to be her husband,
is not really <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but a God, who not only assumes his form,
but, to favour the imposture, the resemblance of the wound re∣ceiv'd
from the boar: Now if he be a God, how is it possible
she should conceive him to be ignorant of the secret of the mar∣riage-bed,
and consequently how can she be convinc'd of the re∣ality
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> from his knowledge of it, when it must necessa∣rily
be known to a God, as well as to the real <HI>Ulysses?</HI> all that
she ought to gather from it is, that the person with whom she
speaks is <HI>Ulysses,</HI> or a God. <HI>Eustathius</HI> replies, that <HI>Penelope</HI> up∣on
the discovery of the secret makes no scruple to yield; because
whether it be <HI>Ulysses,</HI> or a God, her case is happy: if he prove
to be <HI>Ulysses,</HI> she has her wishes; if a God, it is no small piece of
good fortune. <HI>Dacier</HI> condemns this solution, and tells us, that
<HI>Penelope</HI> was so faithful to her husband, that she would not have
receiv'd even a God into the place of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> The true answer (con∣tinues
that Author) is to be drawn from the Pagan Theology,
according to which the inferior Deities were suppos'd to have a
finite knowledge, and consequently <HI>Penelope</HI> might think the
discovery of the nature of the nuptial-bed a full conviction of
the reality of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> it being so great a secret that even a God
might be ignorant of it. But this is all fancy; for allowing this
person to be a God, why might not <HI>Penelope</HI> imagine him to be
a Deity of the superior order, and for that reason well acquainted
with the secrets of this nuptial bow'r? especially because <HI>Jupiter</HI>
himself was notorious for such amorous illusions. <HI>Dacier</HI> her self
confesses this to be no just solution, but gives a very different
reason: How is it possible (says she) that this bed and whole apart∣ment
should be built by the single hand of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> without be∣ing
seen by any person while he builds it? or how can any one
be assured that a secret that is known to a third person (<HI>Actoris</HI>)
is not thro' weakness or interest discovered to others? 'Tis true,
the manner of the discovery entirely depends upon the choice of
the Poet, but I could wish that he had chosen a method more
<PB N="209" REF="206"/>
probable than this of the nuptial bed, which in my judgment
(continues the same Author) is unworthy of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> I am
persuaded that this is one of the places where (as <HI>Horace</HI> writes)
<HI>Homer</HI> nods.</P>
<P>I will lay together what occurs to me by way of reply. The
first objection is, that <HI>Penelope</HI> imagines <HI>Ulysses</HI> to be a God, and
consequently his knowledge of the nuptial bed ought not to
have induc'd her to believe him to be the real <HI>Ulysses:</HI> The an∣swer
is, <HI>Penelope</HI> thought him a God only during her first
transport; it is to be imputed to her surprize, that she at all thinks
him a Deity: This is very evident, for from the moment she
saw him, the thought of his divinity vanishes, and she never men∣tions
one word concerning such a supposition, nay from the first
glance she almost believes him to be the real <HI>Ulysses.</HI>
<Q><L>O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,</L>
<L>Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.</L></Q>
She is so far from thinking him a Deity, that she is almost per∣suaded
that he is her husband. If this be allow'd, the first diffi∣culty
ceases: For granting her belief that the person before her is
a real man, and that no man but <HI>Ulysses</HI> was acquainted with
the nuptial bed; it follows, that this man is the real <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and
that this incident is not ill chosen by the Poet, in the discovery
of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> objects, that this apartment could not possibly be erect∣ed
without being known to other persons; but we have seen <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
build a ship in a solitary Island, without the assistance of
any man, in the fifth <HI>Odyssey;</HI> and why may he not then be al∣low'd
to do the same, with respect to this nuptial bower? All
kind of arts in Mechanics were anciently practis'd by the great∣est
personages, and their knowledge and dexterity in them was
esteem'd a glory. This consideration may perhaps reconcile the
Reader to this part of the discovery.</P>
<P>The only difficulty that now remains is this: <HI>Actoris,</HI> a female
servant, is allow'd to be in the secret; how then can <HI>Penelope</HI> be
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
assur'd that she has not betray'd it? <HI>Homer</HI> himself obviates
this objection; he has in a very solemn manner told us, that on∣ly
twelve of all the female train were guilty of a breach of trust,
and therefore <HI>Penelope</HI> may safely rely upon the fidelity of <HI>Acto∣ris.</HI>
Besides, it adds no small weight to this vindication of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
to observe, that the whole procedure of the discovery is ac∣cidental;
how could <HI>Ulysses</HI> fore-know that the proof of his ve∣racity
would depend upon his knowledge of the bridal bower?
and consequently it is not to be imagin'd that he should have
made any clandestine enquiries about it: It may be added,
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> has been no more than five days upon the <HI>Ithacan</HI>
shores, and probably had never seen <HI>Actoris,</HI> who alone was ac∣quainted
with the nature of this bed: no person was anciently
permitted to enter the womens apartment, but fathers, husbands,
or brothers; this therefore was the greatest secret in all families;
this secret <HI>Penelope</HI> proposes in the tryal of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and upon his
knowledge of it receives him as her husband. To instance al∣most
in a parallel case; <HI>Orestes</HI> in <HI>Euripides</HI> tells <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> that
the lance which <HI>Pelops</HI> used in the combat against <HI>Aenomaus</HI> was
lodg'd in her apartment; this circumstance convinces her that
the person who knew this secret must be her brother <HI>Ore∣stes,</HI>
no persons of a more distant relation being admitted into
such privacies.</P>

Besides, it must be allow'd that the relation it self is very won∣derful;
for it is not easy to conceive that the bole of an olive-tree
should be so large as to contain upon the dimensions of it a whole
bedsted. I would willingly imagine that it is only a supporter of
it. It is likewise somewhat extraordinary that this olive-tree is
not fell'd, or cut up from the roots; for <HI>Eustathius</HI> informs us,
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <HI>to cut asunder at some distance from the
earth;</HI> so that a great part of the trunc is left standing, upon
which <HI>Ulysses</HI> builds his bridal bed. What occurs to me upon
this incident is, that <HI>Homer</HI> must be imagin'd to write according
to the customs of the age in which he liv'd, unless we can sup∣pose
he unnecessarily invented an absurdity; I therefore doubt
not but there were anciently such beds as this of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> Besides,
the more wonderful this bed is, the better it serves for the pur∣pose
of <HI>Homer,</HI> in convincing us that the person who was ac∣quainted
with a matter so uncommon must be the real <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
and not an impostor; it is for this purpose that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oet de∣scribes
the bower built round the olive-tree, before the framing

This I say is particularly describ'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> to convince us that
the place where the bed stood was entirely secret; it being clos'd
up from observation before this particular apartment was underta∣ken,

arms to free her from the impostor.</HI> They defend this application
by having recourse to a tradition, that <HI>Paris</HI> could never have
obtain'd the consent of <HI>Helen</HI> if <HI>Venus</HI> had not given him the re∣semblance
of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> in whose form he prevail'd upon that fa∣tal
beauty: otherwise the instance is no way paralel; for if <HI>Helen</HI>
was not deceived, how can her example be brought to induce
<HI>Penelope</HI> to act with caution, lest she take an impostor to her
bed instead of an husband? I confess this construction of the
<HI>Greek</HI> appears to me very obscure; contrary to the style of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
which is always clear and natural. Besides, it contradicts
the whole story of <HI>Helen</HI> thro' the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and she her
self no where alledges this deceit as her excuse, but frequently con∣demns
her own conduct in forsaking the bed of <HI>Menelaus.</HI> But
granting that she was thus deceiv'd originally, the deceit must ne∣cessarily

This <HI>Penelope</HI> introduces to vindicate her conduct in acting

Ulysses</HI> had said in the sentence immediately preceding,
<Q>A labour long, and hard, remains.</Q>
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
This could not fail of alarming <HI>Penelope,</HI> and raising all her cu∣riosity
to know it. <HI>Homer</HI> would greatly have offended against
nature, if he had not describ'd her under an impatience upon
the mention of it; her fondness is too sincere to be indifferent
upon such a suggestion, but her answer to <HI>Ulysses</HI> chiefly demands
observation.
<Q><L>If heav'n a kind release from ills foreshows,</L>
<L>Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes!</L></Q>
This discovers a greatness of spirit worthy of a Queen and He∣roine:
she is threatned to lose <HI>Ulysses</HI> by a second absence, she is
alarmed with a new train of his sufferings; but being inform'd
that all these calamities will end in a prosperous issue, that long
life and happiness attend him, she not only takes courage perso∣nally,
but comforts her husband. <HI>Homer</HI> was too good a judge
of decency to ascribe the weakness that attends the generality of
that sex to <HI>Penelope;</HI> she has a bravery of soul worthy of a Heroine
in Epic Poetry. Besides, this is a further instance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
judgment: the event of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is to shew <HI>Ulysses</HI> happy; now
if the Poet had not fully satisfy'd the Reader in this respect, he
had not reinstated his Heroe in prosperity, and consequently had
defeated the Moral of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> which is to shew wisdom and
virtue triumphant, by representing his Heroe after all difficulties
settled in full tranquillity.</P>

The Reader may be pleas'd to consult the Annotations on
book XI. <HI>p.</HI> 136. concerning the answer of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to <HI>Penelope;</HI>
it being a repetition from that part of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> informs us, that <HI>Aristarchus,</HI> and <HI>Aristophanes</HI> the
<HI>Grammarian,</HI> thought the verse quoted at the head of this remark
to be the conclusion of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and consequently they judged
<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
the remaining part of this book and the whole 24th supposititious:
those who were of a contrary opinion reply'd, that by ending
the Poem with that verse, many incidents of great importance
would be rejected; for instance, the recapitulation of the whole
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> and especially the discovery of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to his father <HI>Laer∣tes,</HI>
with all the beatiful fictions contain'd in it. They add, that
if the little relation that the beginning of that book bears to the
subject of the Poem be a reason for the rejection of it, we must
for the same reason abridge the Poem, and reject a multitude of
the Fables which are scatter'd thro' the whole course of it. It may
therefore be conjectured that <HI>Aristarchus</HI> and <HI>Aristophanes</HI> were
not of opinion that the Poem ended with this verse, but only
the most necessary and important incidents. <HI>Casaubon</HI> in a remark
upon a passage of <HI>Strabo,</HI> favours the opinion of <HI>Aristarchus,</HI> for
he there speaks of the last book as if he suspected it to be spuri∣ous;
and <HI>Rapin</HI> joyns in the same judgment. <HI>Homer</HI> is to be de∣fended
in another manner, than by such arguments as are brought
in answer to <HI>Aristarchus.</HI> The same objection has been made
against the two last books of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> as against these of the <HI>O∣dyssey;</HI>
the former ought to have ended with the decisive action
in the death of <HI>Hector,</HI> and the latter with the discovery of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
to <HI>Penelope,</HI> when his happiness seems to be establish'd. But
there is no weight in these objections. There is a difference
between the <HI>unravelling</HI> of the action, and the full <HI>accomplishment</HI>
of it; the Action is unravell'd by the death of the Suitors; but
there are consequences arising from their deaths that hinder the
accomplishment of the action; namely, the danger of the re∣sentments
of their friends, who rise in arms to revenge their slaugh∣ter;
and till their insurrection is pacify'd, <HI>Ulysses</HI> cannot be said
to be in a state of security. The subject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the Anger
of <HI>Achilles;</HI> that of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> the Re-establishment of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in
his dominions; now the anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> ends not with the death
of <HI>Hector,</HI> nor is <HI>Ulysses</HI> fully re-established by the death of the
Suitors; he has another obstacle to overcome, and till the com∣motions
of the <HI>Ithacans</HI> are appeas'd, the design of the Poem is
not executed, which is to shew <HI>Ulysses</HI> in peaceful possession of
<PB N="216" REF="213"/>
his Palace and Authority. We see in this very book, that <HI>Ulysses</HI>
is forc'd to fly from his own Palace; can he then be said to be
re-establish'd in tranquillity? this very action demonstrates, that
what follows is part of the subject of the Poem, and such a part,
as if it had not been related, would have given us room to have
imagin'd that <HI>Homer</HI> had never finish'd it, or that the conclusi∣on
of it had been lost. The beginning of the Action is his
sailing from <HI>Troy</HI> toward his country; the middle contains all
the calamities he sustains in his return, the disorders of his family
before and after it; and the end of the Action is his re-establish∣ment
in the peaceful possession of his kingdoms, when he is ac∣knowledg'd
by his wife, father, family, and subjects: now this
is not compleated till the very end of the last book, and conse∣quently
that book is not spurious, but essential. The Poet had
ended very injudiciously, if he had stopp'd before; for the Rea∣der
would have remain'd unsatisfy'd in two necessary points, <HI>viz.</HI>
how he was made known to <HI>Laertes,</HI> and what vengeance the
chief families of the nation endeavour'd to take against the de∣stroyers
of their sons; but this storm being once blown over, and
all his subjects who had taken arms being either vanquish'd or
appeas'd, the Action is compleated in all its parts, and consum∣mates
the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 324. <HI>A mournful story of domestic woes.]</HI> It is with
great judgment that the Poet passes thus briefly over the story of
<HI>Penelope;</HI> he makes her impatience to hear the history of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
the pretended occasion of her conciseness; the true reason is, he is
unwilling to tire his Reader by repeating what he already knows:
It is likewise remarkable, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> does not begin his own ad∣ventures
by a detail of his sufferings during the war of <HI>Troy;</HI> for this
would have been foreign to the design of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> but with
his sailing from <HI>Troy</HI> to the <HI>Cicons,</HI> and enters directly into the
subject of it. He likewise concludes an Epitome of the whole
<PB N="217" REF="214"/>
<HI>Odyssey</HI> in the compass of one and thirty lines; and purposely
contracts it, because we are already acquainted with the whole
relation.</P>
<P><HI>Lycophron</HI> has given us a summary of the wandrings of <HI>Ulysses;</HI>
which if any one is desirous to compare with this of <HI>Homer,</HI>
he will see the difference between a clear, and an obscure Writer.
<HI>Tibullus</HI> in his <HI>Panegyric</HI> on <HI>Messala</HI> has been more successful than
<HI>Lycophron,</HI> he follows the order of <HI>Homer,</HI> and treads directly in
his footsteps.

<HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion, that this recapitulation in <HI>Homer</HI> has a very
good effect. I will translate her observation. We learn from it,
that the subject of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is not alone the return of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
to his country, and his re-establishment in it; but that it com∣prehends
all his wandrings and all his voyages; all that he saw,
or suffer'd in his return to it; in a word, all that he underwent
after he set sail from the shores of <HI>Troy:</HI> Another advantage we
reap from it is, that we see the order and train of the adven∣tures
of his Heroe, as they really happen'd, naturally and histo∣rically:
for in his relation of them in his Poem, he uses an ar∣tificial
order; that is, he begins at the latter end, and finds an
opportunity to insert all that precedes the opening of his Poem by
way of narration to the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> Here he sets every event in its
natural order, so that with a glance of the eye we may distinguish
what gives continuity to the action, and what is comprehended
in it. By this method we are able to separate the time of the du∣ration
of the Poem, from the time of the duration of the Acti∣on;
for in reality the Poem begins many years before the return
of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> begins his action but thirty five days be∣fore
<PB N="218" REF="215"/>
he lands in his own country. In the course therefore of
the <HI>Odyssey, Homer</HI> gave us the artificial, here the natural or∣der;
which is an ease and assistance to the memory of the
Reader.</P>

<P><Q><L>VERSE 355.—<HI>How his companions slay</HI></L>
<L>The oxen sacred to the God of day.]</L></Q>
The story of these oxen is fully related, <HI>lib.</HI> 12. I refer to the
Annotations. The crime of the companions of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
was sacrilege, they having destroy'd the herds sacred to a
God. These herds were said to be immortal: I have there given
the reason of it, but too concisely, and will therefore add a sup∣plement
from the <HI>Polyhymnia</HI> of <HI>Herodotus;</HI> I ought to have men∣tion'd,
that the body of soldiers call'd Immortal, was a select num∣ber
of men in the army of <HI>Xerxes:</HI> so nam'd, because upon the
death of any one of their number, whether by war or sickness,
another was immediately substituted into his room, so that they
never amounted to more or less than ten thousand. If we apply
this piece of History to the herds of <HI>Apollo,</HI> it excellently explains
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poetry: they are call'd Immortal, because upon the death
of any one of the whole herd, another was brought into its
place; they are said neither to increase nor decay, because they
were always of a fix'd number, and continually supply'd upon
any vacancy.</P>
<P>The Reader will be appriz'd of the heinousness of the crime
in killing these oxen, from an observation of <HI>Bochart, p.</HI> 314.
The <HI>Phaenicians</HI> and <HI>Aegyptians</HI> so superstitiously abstain'd from the
flesh of the ox, that, as <HI>Porphyry</HI> affirms, they would sooner feed
upon human flesh than that of such beasts. <HI>Aelian</HI> tells us, that
it was death amongst the <HI>Phrygians</HI> to kill a labouring ox; and
<HI>Varro, Rust. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 5. thus writes; <HI>ab hoc antiqui manus ita
abstineri voluerunt, ut capite sanxerint, si quis occidisset.</HI> Thus also
<HI>Columella,</HI> in <HI>praefat. lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Cujus tanta fuit apud antiquos venera∣tio,
ut tam Capitale esset bovem necâsse, quam civem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="216"/>
I have been the more full upon this head, to shew that <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>'s
fiction is built upon a foundation of truth, and that he
writes according to the religion of the Ancients: <HI>Rapin</HI> is very
severe upon him for ascribing the death of the companions of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> to the violation of these herds of <HI>Apollo.</HI> “The reason
(says he) why they are destroy'd is very ridiculous, because,
<HI>lib.</HI> 1.”
<Q><L>—they dar'd to prey</L>
<L>On herds devoted to the God of day.</L></Q>
“This is certainly a far-fetch'd destruction: The Heroe, or the
Poet was willing to be freed from them.” But from this ob∣servation,
they will be found to be guilty of sacrilege, and a vio∣lation
of what was regarded by the world with the utmost vene∣ration;
and consequently the crime is adaequate to the punishment.
Besides, <HI>Horace Epist.</HI> 6. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. gives sentence against these
companions of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

This is a circumstance (observes Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>) that <HI>Ulysses</HI> ought
by no means to forget; for it gives him an opportunity to pay
an high compliment to his wife, by letting her know he pre∣ferr'd
her person to that of <HI>Calypso</HI> a Goddess: this is the reason
why he enlarges upon it in five verses; whereas he concludes
most of the other adventures in little more than one. But (adds
that Lady) we may easily believe that he was silent about the
nature of his conversation with that Nymph; and indeed it would
have lessen'd the compliment, and perhaps his welcome home,
if he had not been able to keep a secret; he is very cautious in
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
this respect; he enlarges upon the fondness of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alypso</HI> for his

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been already prov'd, that this book is
the genuine work of <HI>Homer;</HI> but perhaps
the Reader may not be displeas'd to see the
reasons why it was rejected by so great a
Critic as <HI>Aristarchus:</HI> I shall therefore lay
them before him from <HI>Didymus</HI> and <HI>Spon∣danus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristarchus</HI> affirms, that this is the only
place in <HI>Homer,</HI> where <HI>Mercury</HI> performs the office of conduct∣ing
the souls of the dead; and that there is no proof he was
known so early by the title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that this is the
only passage where he is call'd <HI>Cyllenius;</HI> that the ceremony of
his guiding the souls is contrary to other descriptions of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
where they all descend without a guide into the mansions
of the dead, even before the funeral rites. That it is absurd to
imagine a <HI>white rock</HI> in these kingdoms of darkness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To these
<HI>Didymus</HI> thus replies. If a single mention of any incident in <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
were a reason for its rejection, abundance of passages must
<PB N="260" REF="255"/>
be rejected. He thinks it a sufficient argument, that <HI>Mercury</HI> was
call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Cyllenius</HI> in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> that he
is here mention'd under these titles; but this is begging the questi∣on.
He adds, that altho' the souls of the dead descend without
a guide in other places, this hinders not but they may descend
with one; for they are in other places only said in general to
descend, whereas here the manner of their descent is particulari∣zed.
Neither is it any objection against this book, to say that
it is contrary to the manner of <HI>Homer</HI> to describe the shades of
the dead receiv'd immediately into the state of <HI>Achilles, Agamem∣non,</HI>
&amp;c. before the performance of their funeral ceremonies;
this (says he) is a favour granted by <HI>Mercury</HI> to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who
was descended from that Deity, he being the father of <HI>Arci∣sius</HI>
and consequently great grandfather to <HI>Ulysses.</HI> It was the
opinion of the Ancients, that the shades of the deceas'd could
visit the earth before the obsequies were finish'd, but not after∣wards;
this is evident from the words of <HI>Patroclus, Iliad</HI> 23.
<Q><L>—To the further shore,</L>
<L>When once we pass, the soul returns no more.</L></Q>
It is therefore out of favour to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that <HI>Mercury</HI> introduces
these shades into the region where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> resided, before the
funeral ceremonies, that they might not return to earth and dis∣quiet
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> But there may be a stronger objection made
against the former part of this book; namely, that this is
an Episode which has no relation to the principal subject,
and that we may retrench it without destroying any part of
the Action essential to the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> But it may be answer'd,
that tho' it makes no part of the principal Action, yet it
has a sufficient connection with it: it is the sequel of the
death of the Suitors, and consequently the principal Action is
the cause of it; it is drawn and deduc'd from it, and <HI>Homer</HI> makes
a very happy use of it to adorn and diversify his Poem, with the
History of what happen'd before <HI>Troy,</HI> after the conclusion of the
<PB N="261" REF="256"/>
<HI>Iliad;</HI> and in particular, with the death of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and a de∣scription
of his funeral ceremonies. <HI>Didymus, Dacier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> in the beginning of his third Dialogue, <HI>de Repub.</HI> brings
an heavy charge against <HI>Homer,</HI> for the disadvantageous character
he gives of a future state. He quotes the similitude of the Bats,
and affirms that the dreadful description of the condition of the
dead, must deter mankind from hazarding their lives, even in the
cause of their country. “Let us then (says that Author) with
the permission of <HI>Homer</HI> and other Poets, reject such relati∣ons,
not because they are unpoetical, not because they are
unpleasant to read, but because by how much they are
more pleasant and poetical, by so much they are more dange∣rous,
and to be kept from our youth, and men, who are born
to assert their liberty with the hazard of their lives, and prefer
death to slavery.” It must be allow'd that this is strong rea∣soning,
and it is not easy to guard the doctrine of <HI>Homer</HI> from
such unhappy consequences; for why should men chuse to die, ra∣ther
than be slaves, when by death they fall into a worse condition?
It will not be an answer to say that <HI>Homer</HI> asserts a threefold state
in futurity; <HI>viz.</HI> of the soul, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>vehicle,</HI> and the
body: and that while the <HI>vehicle</HI> is in this condition of hor∣rors,
the soul may be happy; for still the state of the dead is re∣presented
as a state of horror, and man is in part (namely, in
his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) miserable after death: Nay so miserable, that even
<HI>Hercules,</HI> who was a God and receiv'd amongst the Deities,
is yet tormented in Hell; <HI>lib.</HI> XI.
<Q><L>Here hov'ring ghosts, like fowl, his shade surround,</L>
<L>And clang their pinions with terrific sound,</L>
<L>Gloomy as night he stands, in act to throw</L>
<L>Th' aerial arrow from the twanging bow.</L></Q>
It will indeed be a vindication of <HI>Homer</HI> as a Poet, to say, that
he wrote according to the opinion of his age; and that such as was
the notion of the Ancients of a future state, such is his description
<PB N="262" REF="257"/>
of it. I will only add, that we may collect from <HI>Plato,</HI> that
he judg'd this book genuine, for he quotes this passage as
<HI>Homer</HI>'s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 17. <HI>And</HI> Leucas' <HI>rock</HI>—] This description of
the descent into hell is more particular than that in the XIth
<HI>Odyssey;</HI> and each particular is well suited to the subject; the de∣scent
is fabled to be by the Ocean, because the Sun seems to
descend thro' it into Night or the region of darkness, in the we∣stern
parts of Heaven. <HI>Milton</HI> fables the Sun to rise thro' the
gates of light, after the manner of the Ancients.
<Q><L>—'Till morn,</L>
<L>Wak'd by the circling hours, with rosy hand</L>
<L>Unbarr'd the gates of light—</L></Q>
The circumstance likewise of going thro' the region of <HI>dreams</HI> is
well chosen; Dreams are the attendants of sleep, the brother of
death; they come by night, and are therefore well imagin'd
to have relation to the kingdom of death, and to be introducto∣ry
to it; <HI>Virgil</HI> in the descent of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into hell, has borrow'd
this image,
<Q><L>—Quam sedem somnia vulgo</L>
<L>Vana tenere ferunt—</L></Q>
<Q><L>The God of sleep there hides his heavy head,</L>
<L>And empty dreams on every leaf are spread.</L></Q>
The only circumstance liable to objection is, the <HI>Leucadian,</HI> or
<HI>white</HI> rock, which <HI>Aristarchus</HI> thought improperly placed in the road
to the realms of darkness; but (replies <HI>Eustathius</HI>) this is only meant
<PB N="263" REF="258"/>
of a rock standing on the extremities of the earth, or a rock
on which the last rays of the Sun fall. <HI>Dacier</HI> imagines, that
there is a further meaning in the expression: “There is an Island
over-against <HI>Acarnania,</HI> on the west of <HI>Ithaca,</HI> call'd <HI>Leucas,</HI>
from a white rock standing in it; this rock was famous in
antiquity, because lovers in despair threw themselves from the
top of it into the ocean; it was call'd <HI>the Lover's leap,</HI> and
being thus remarkable for the deaths of numbers of people,
<HI>Homer</HI> places it here.” This is no ill explication; for a rock
may well be feign'd to stand at the entrance of the region of
death, by which so many persons had enter'd into it.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Epistles</HI> mentions this <HI>Leucadian</HI> rock.</P>
<Q><L>—O you that love in vain,</L>
<L><HI>Fly hence, and seek the far</HI> Leucadian <HI>main:</HI></L>
<L>There stands a rock from whose impending steep,</L>
<L>Apollo'<HI>s fane surveys the rolling deep;</HI></L>
<L>There injur'd lovers, leaping from above,</L>
<L>Their flames extinguish, and forget to love.</L></Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 35. <HI>O mighty chief!</HI> (Pelides <HI>thus began</HI>) &amp;c.] This
appears to be introduc'd somewhat unnaturally: <HI>Achilles</HI> had
now been dead about ten years, and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> almost as long;
it can therefore scarce be reconcil'd to probability, to imagine
that they should not have met before this time, and mutually
have satisfy'd their curiosities, by relating their several stories at
some former interview: <HI>Dacier</HI> indeed remarks, that we are not
to imagine this conference was held at the time when the Sui∣tors
descended, but upon some preceding occasion, immediately
after the death of <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> If this be allow'd, yet the ob∣jection
remains, that the introduction is forc'd and unnatural,
for then the descent of <HI>Mercury</HI> and the shades of the Suitors
will be no reason why this conference should be here repeat∣ed;
for so, neither <HI>Mercury</HI> nor the Suitors hear it. But
<PB N="264" REF="259"/>
<HI>Dacier</HI> is undoubtedly in an error; for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the original is the
third person plural, and absolutely refers to <HI>Mercury</HI> and the shades
of the Suitors; and therefore it follows that this conference hap∣pen'd
at the time of their entrance.</P>
<P>The shades of the Suitors (observes <HI>Dacier</HI>) when they are sum∣mon'd
by <HI>Mercury</HI> out of the Palace of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> emit a feeble
plaintive, inarticulate sound, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>strident:</HI> Whereas <HI>Agamem∣non</HI>
and the shades that have long been in the state of the dead
speak articulately. I doubt not but <HI>Homer</HI> intended to shew by
the former description, that when the soul is separated from the
organs of the body, it ceases to act after the same manner, as
while it was joyn'd to it; but how the dead recover their voices
afterwards is not so easy to understand. In other respects <HI>Virgil</HI>
paints after <HI>Homer.</HI>
<Q><L>—pars tollere vocem</L>
<L>Exiguam: inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes.</L></Q>
<Q><L>They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes,</L>
<L>But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats. <HI>Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
But why should we suppose with <HI>Dacier,</HI> that these shades of the
Suitors have lost the faculty of speaking? I rather imagine, that
the sounds they utter'd were signs of complaint and discontent,
and proceeded not from an inability to speak: After <HI>Patroclus</HI>
was slain, he appears to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and speaks very articulately
to him; yet to express his sorrow at his departure he acts like
these Suitors: for <HI>Achilles</HI>
<Q><L>Like a thin smoke beholds the spirit fly,</L>
<L>And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.</L></Q>
<HI>Dacier</HI> conjectures, that the power of speech ceases in the dead,
till they are admitted into a state of rest; but <HI>Patroclus</HI> is an
instance to the contrary in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and <HI>Elpenor</HI> in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="260"/>
for they both speak before their funeral rites are perform'd, and
consequently before they enter into a state of repose amongst the
shades of the happy.</P>

<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 56. <HI>Great, and terrific ev'n in death</HI>—] There is
a very peculiar beauty in the versification of <HI>Homer</HI> in this place:
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
The words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> set the largeness of the body of
<HI>Achilles</HI> stretch'd out upon the ground full before our eyes; we
see him in the description; the repetition forces it upon our ob∣servation,
so that the mind has time to dwell upon it, and ad∣mire
the extent of the limbs of that Heroe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 68.—<HI>Terror seiz'd the</HI> Grecian <HI>train.]</HI> This de∣scription
furnish'd <HI>Aristarchus</HI> with another objection to this book:
He thought it improbable that the appearance of <HI>Thetis</HI> and her
Sea-nymphs should terrify the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> army: they say in
answer, that all the ocean was in a great commotion as <HI>Thetis</HI>
ascended, or as <HI>Homer</HI> expresses it,
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</L></Q>
This uproar occasion'd their fear; the <HI>Greeks</HI> were ignorant of
the cause of it, and consequently apprehended some dreadful
event; this is evident, for <HI>Nestor</HI> appeases their consternation by
unfolding the reason of the tumult, and shewing them that it was
occasion'd by the ascent of <HI>Thetis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="261"/>
The Reader has undoubtedly observ'd how excellently <HI>Homer</HI>
sustains his characters; <HI>Nestor</HI> is the wisest man, both in the <HI>Ili∣ad</HI>
and <HI>Odyssey:</HI> he has the experience of a very great age, and
may therefore be suppos'd to be acquainted with all the most un∣common
appearances in nature: The Poet accordingly describes
him as the only person not afraid in the <HI>Grecian</HI> army: there were
others undoubtedly as brave as <HI>Nestor,</HI> but no one so wise; his
intrepidity is therefore to be imputed to his wisdom, not brave∣ry,
and this furnishes us with an excellent moral; That igno∣rance
is usually the source of fear.</P>
<P>The character of <HI>Achilles</HI> is no less happily supported; the same
love of glory is visible in all he speaks, that distinguish'd his
character thro' the <HI>Iliad:</HI> he still prefers a short life with fame,
before old age without it.
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
The sentiment is truly heroic; dishonour is worse than death,
the happiness or misery of which is not to be measured by time,
but glory; long life is but lengthen'd mortality, and they who
live the longest have but the small privilege of creeping more lei∣surely
than others to their graves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 77. <HI>Round thee, the</HI> Muses—] It is impossible
(observes <HI>Dacier</HI>) not to be struck with the noble fictions of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
in honour of <HI>Achilles;</HI> every circumstance is great. A whole
army is in tears; the <HI>Muses</HI> celebrate his glory; a Goddess and
her Nymphs ennoble it with their presence and lamentations.
At the funerals of other Heroes, women and captives are the
mourners; here the <HI>Muses</HI> personally appear. Heaven and Earth,
Men and Gods interest themselves in the obsequies of so great an
<PB N="267" REF="262"/>
Heroe! Yet from this place <HI>Aristarchus</HI> draws an argument
for rejecting this book: <HI>Homer</HI> (says he) no where else gives the
number of the nine <HI>Muses,</HI> insinuating that their number was
not fix'd in his age; but <HI>Homer</HI> frequently invokes the <HI>Muses,</HI>
why then should he be ignorant of the number? and if not igno∣rant
of it, why might he not mention it? <HI>Aristarchus</HI> further adds,
that it is absurd to imagine the body of <HI>Achilles</HI> could be

<L><HI>To move the great</HI> Ulysses <HI>to the war.</HI>]</L>
<P>It is not obvious why <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who was a person of the great∣est
bravery, should be unwilling to engage in such an action of
glory, as the war of <HI>Troy:</HI> Was it because he foresaw that it
would be a work of danger, (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> imagines) or was he
dissatisfy'd in the ground of it, which was only to revenge the
rape of <HI>Helen,</HI> and nothing but a private injury? the former is
a reason unworthy of his heroic character, the latter is no more
than a conjecture. It may possibly be a truer reason that he
was unwilling to forsake his wife, of whom he was very fond,
<PB N="269" REF="264"/>
and whom he had newly marry'd; but then it must be allow'd;
that he prefers his love to his glory. <HI>Eustathius</HI> recites the man∣ner
how he was drawn to engage in the war of <HI>Troy: Ulysses</HI> to
deliver himself from the importunities of his friends to assist <HI>Aga∣memnon,</HI>
pretended madness, and yok'd two animals of a different
kind to a plough, and began to work with them; <HI>Palamedes</HI> who
suspected the imposture, took his son <HI>Telemachus,</HI> an infant, and
laid him in the furrow before the plough; <HI>Ulysses</HI> turn'd aside not
to hurt his child, and this discover'd the imposition. <HI>Aristotle</HI>
takes notice of the great judgment of <HI>Homer</HI> in suppressing this
incident concerning <HI>Ulysses,</HI> it being unworthy of the bravery of
an Heroe: He is proving, <HI>Chap.</HI> 8. of his Poetics, that all the acti∣ons
of an Heroe's life are not to be inserted in an Epic Poem,
for the actions of the same man are so many and different, that
we can never reduce them to unity: For this reason <HI>Homer</HI> men∣tions
not all the adventures of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but only such as have re∣lation
to the subject of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> he knew that this counter∣feit
madness had no connexion either in truth or probability with
the subject of his Poem, and therefore he forbears the mention
of it. The Reader will understand the meaning of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> if
he considers that the subject of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is the story of a per∣son
who suffers great calamities in the return to his country; before
he establishes himself in his dominions: Now the counterfeited
madness of <HI>Ulysses</HI> has no connection with these sufferings, and
consequently is judiciously omitted by <HI>Homer</HI> as foreign to the
design of the Poem, and contrary to the unity of the action.
A detail of all the adventures of an Heroe's life is the province
of History; the relation of one single, great, and surprizing action
is the subject of Epic Poetry.</P>

the knowledge of it; and such stratagems being agreeable to the
character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> he imputes this action to him rather than
<HI>Penelope.</HI></P>
<P>It is impossible not to take notice that <HI>Homer</HI> makes repetiti∣on
after repetition: <HI>Agamemnon</HI> speaks the same words as in the
eleventh <HI>Odyssey; Amphimedon</HI> the same as in the second; and the
whole account of the Suitors' destruction is no more than a re∣cital
of what the Reader already knows. Was <HI>Homer</HI> tir'd at the
end of his work, and would not give himself the labour of in∣vention?
I confess we may lose our appetite to see the same en∣tertainment
thus continually serv'd up in the very same manner,
without so much as a new garnishment. I fear the words of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
may sometimes be applicable to <HI>Homer.</HI>
<Q>And what so tedious as a twice-told tale?</Q>
Besides, this whole infernal interview is merely ornamental, which
the Poet was at liberty to insert or omit according to his judg∣ment,
without breaking the thread of the principal action; it
might therefore be wish'd that he had substituted some other in∣cident
in the room of it, and given a greater diversity to the
story: If by laying the scene in Hell, he design'd to raise the won∣der
and curiosity of the Reader, (who cannot fail of having his
attention waken'd to see a prospect open'd beyond the bounds
of nature, and to look into the state of departed Heroes)
yet it must be confess'd that this design has already been fully
executed in the eleventh of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> But the Poet seems
to introduce the descent for the information of the dead rather
than the living; <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is told how the Suitors were destroy∣ed
by <HI>Ulysses;</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> how nobly the <HI>Greeks</HI> perform'd his
funeral obsequies; incidents that very little contribute to the story
of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> In short, the main action stands still during this
whole <HI>Episode,</HI> which takes up almost half the book, and the lat∣ter
<PB N="271" REF="266"/>
part of the <HI>Episode</HI> presents no new object to amuse and en∣tertain
us. But,

it will not be improper here to particularize from whence An∣tiquity
rais'd the fictions concerning Hell, and the nature of it,
as we have it in <HI>Diodorus Siculus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pluto</HI> (observes that Author) was the first that introduc'd the
rites of sepulture, and other ceremonies bestow'd on the dead:
This is the reason why the Ancients imagin'd him to be the
King of the dead.</P>
<P><HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> is said to have been the most just man in the world,
he severely punish'd robbers and other notorious offenders, and
from his singular reputation for integrity was feign'd to be
the judge of the good and bad after death; and for the same rea∣son
<HI>Minos</HI> was joyn'd with him in the same dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="267"/>
<HI>Homer</HI> borrow'd his fictions from <HI>Orpheus, Orpheus</HI> from the <HI>Aegyp∣tians:</HI>
it was <HI>Orpheus</HI> who introduced the opinion of the pains of the
damn'd, and of the <HI>Elysian</HI> fields, and taught that the souls of the
dead were conducted by <HI>Mercury</HI> into the infernal mansions: (a
proof that he was call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before the days of <HI>Homer</HI>)
<HI>Diodorus</HI> proceeds and mentions the beginning of this book, how
<HI>Homer</HI> feigns that <HI>Mercury</HI> leads the shades of the dead by the Oce∣an,
the <HI>Leucadian</HI> rock, and the gates of the sun: A plain instance
that he look'd upon this book as the genuine work of <HI>Homer.</HI>
All these fables (continues <HI>Diodorus</HI>) are of <HI>Aegyptian</HI> extract;
by the Ocean, <HI>Homer</HI> means <HI>Nilus;</HI> by the gates of the sun, he
means <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> a city sacred to the Sun; the meadow in∣to
which the shades are conducted, denotes the pleasant mea∣dows
full of canes adjoyning to <HI>Memphis;</HI> and the dead are feign∣ed
to reside there, because it was the general burial place amongst
the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI> Concerning <HI>Cocytus, Acheron,</HI> &amp;c. the Reader may
consult the first Note upon the eleventh <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of <HI>Isis</HI> and <HI>Osyris</HI> agrees with <HI>Diodo∣rus</HI>
concerning the extraction of these fables from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and
mentions at <HI>Memphis</HI> the gates of lamentation and oblivion; that
is, of <HI>Lethe,</HI> and <HI>Cocytus;</HI> which being open'd at the burial of
the dead, give a doleful and groaning sound. From hence they are
thus describ'd by <HI>Homer</HI> in the tenth <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>And where slow rolling from the</HI> Stygian <HI>bed</HI></L>
<L>Cocytus' <HI>lamentable waters spread,</HI></L>
<L>Where the dark rock o'erhangs th' infernal lake,</L>
<L>And mingling streams eternal murmurs make.</L></Q>
<P>These observations give light to most of <HI>Homer</HI>'s fictions con∣cerning
hell, and shew that his Poetry is built upon the customs
of Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Macrobius</HI> explains all these particulars after a different manner:
This solution supposes a state of pre-existence of the soul: If (says
that Author) “To die, be the same as to go to the infernal regions;
to enjoy the supernal, is then to live; and therefore before Philo∣sophy
<PB N="273" REF="268"/>
prevail'd, the body it self was suppos'd to be the infernal re∣ceptacle
of the Soul, into which she descended as into a prison,
from above; this was thought the sepulchre of the soul, and
the cave of <HI>Pluto.</HI> The river of Oblivion denotes the error
of the soul, which forgets the Majesty of the former state she
enjoy'd before she enter'd the body: <HI>Phlegethon,</HI> the ardor of
our desires, and flames of anger: <HI>Acheron</HI> all our words and
actions that bring us into sorrows; so likewise, <HI>Styx</HI> implies
our hatred, <HI>Cocytus</HI> our grief and lamentation. Thus also the
punishments in hell are verify'd upon earth: the Vultur which
preys upon the liver of <HI>Tityus,</HI> is the sting of a guilty consci∣ence;
the ambitious man is the <HI>Sisyphus,</HI> who is eternally as∣piring,
and yet always disappointed; the avaritious man is the
<HI>Tantalus</HI> who starves amidst his plenty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>By joyning these two interpretations together, we have at once
the double pleasure of a beautiful fable and instructive moral; from
the whole we may collect, that altho' the ancients were ignorant
of the true nature of a future state, yet that they believ'd it, and
expected there would be punishments and rewards in it. This note
is of use to explain several passages in the eleventh <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

This is the first appearance of <HI>Laertes,</HI> he is the very picture of
melancholy, his dress, his employ, and solitary life all discover a
fix'd sorrow and contempt of the world. It has been a dispute
whether we are to ascribe this retreat of <HI>Laertes</HI> to a meaness of
spirit, who forsakes his station, and is unequal to adversity; or to
wisdom, and a noble neglect of the pomp and splendor of the
<PB N="275" REF="270"/>
world, by which he prefers a little rural retreat to all the mag∣nificence
of a Palace, and a small garden to all the dominions
of a King. <HI>Plutarch</HI> severely censures his conduct: “A person
(observes that writer) who wastes his age in his bed, or in tri∣vial
affairs, makes himself an object of contempt, as <HI>Homer</HI>
teaches by the examples of <HI>Nestor</HI> and <HI>Laertes: Nestor,</HI> by en∣gaging
in the war of <HI>Troy,</HI> obtain'd the utmost veneration;
while <HI>Laertes,</HI> who abandon'd himself to solitude, was despis'd
universally.” I am unwilling to subscribe to this observation,
being of opinion that the silent virtues of a good man in soli∣tude
are more amiable than all the noisy honours of active life.
The picture of <HI>Laertes</HI> is undoubtedly drawn very naturally; a
tender father is afflicted for the loss of a brave and beloved son,
this bitter ingredient gives a disrelish to all the vanities of life;
he is depriv'd of an object that he valu'd above the world, he
therefore neglects it, as having nothing worthy of his cares, and
abandons it for privacy and tranquillity. <HI>Menedemus</HI> in <HI>Terence</HI>
is the very copy of <HI>Laertes</HI> in <HI>Homer;</HI> an instance that he thought
<HI>Homer</HI>'s an exact representation of human nature: and the applause
with which that Comedy was receiv'd, shews that all <HI>Rome</HI> was of
the same judgment. Sorrow loves to be alone, it rather seeks for
amusements than business and glory; and it may perhaps be
true, that it shews more greatness of soul to resign a kingdom
than to conquer it. Pride, ambition, and guilty passions have
rais'd many to the top of human glory; but it evidences that a
person is not influenced by vicious sentiments, who knows how
to moderate his desires, and is able to retire from the splendor
of a Crown into obscurity. <HI>Tully</HI> mentions the manner of life
in <HI>Laertes,</HI> without condemnation; the place is to be found in his
<HI>Cato Major,</HI> where he speaks of the innocent amusements of old
age, and illustrates his assertions by the example of <HI>Laertes. Ho∣merus

of his person; they likewise condemn the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which
<HI>Homer</HI> puts into the mouth of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> It must be allow'd, that
those words are frequently us'd by the Poet in a bad sense, and
fignify <HI>heart-wounding,</HI> or <HI>reproachful words;</HI> but here they are
not so to be understood; they only imply, <HI>that</HI> Ulysses <HI>blam'd</HI> La∣ertes
<HI>out of tenderness for taking no more care of his person;</HI> this is
not a reproach, but the language of fondness and affection: or
perhaps the Poet meant to express that this enquiry rais'd ima∣ges

<HI>A sharp sensation struck his nostrils. Eustathius</HI> judges, that the
meaning is, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> perceived himself ready to burst into
tears; a kind of a pricking sharp sensation being felt in the no∣strils
before the eruption of tears. <HI>Casaubon</HI> more fully explains
it; he observes that all violent passions cause a sensation in the
nostrils, arising from the ebullition of the spirits, which mount
toward the brain, and endeavouring to free themselves from re∣straint
find a vent by the nostril, and crouding thro' it, dilate it
in their passage; this is evident from animals, and the nobler
kinds of them, as the bull, the horse, the lion, whose nostrils al∣ways
dilate when mov'd to anger. A similar expression is found
in the first <HI>Idyllium</HI> of <HI>Theocritus.</HI>

He speaks of the anger of the God <HI>Pan,</HI> but it is applicable to
all violence of passion. <HI>Aristotle</HI> (observes <HI>Dacier</HI>) quotes this
verse as apply'd by <HI>Homer</HI> to express anger, <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. of his Mo∣rals
to <HI>Nicomachus,</HI> but he is evidently in an error; for there is here
no mention of anger: he undoubtedly trusted to his memory, it
being sorrow arising from filial tenderness which moves <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

<P><Q><L>VERSE 389. <HI>The sev'ral trees you gave me long ago,</HI></L>
<L>While yet a child—]</L></Q>
The word in the original is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies <HI>a very young
boy: Homer</HI> uses it to express the age, when out of a childish sim∣plicity
<HI>Ulysses</HI> ask'd his father to grant him such and such trees.
Such requests are very natural in children, and we see (says <HI>Dacier</HI>)
the same practis'd every day; Parents out of fondness indulge
the requests of their children in such little particularities, and a
bird, an horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continues the child's favourite for many years.
It must be allow'd, that no Poet ever follow'd nature so faith∣fully
as <HI>Homer. Virgil</HI> perhaps has reach'd his noblest elevations
and sublimities, but there is a greater variety of natural incidents,
more exact pictures of human life in <HI>Homer</HI> than in all other Poets.
Some Painters excel in the boldness of their figures, and know
how to draw a Heroe or a God, but are less happy in lower sub∣jects;
but <HI>Homer</HI> draws universally, and is excellent upon all oc∣casions;
he paints the largest figures or the least sketches equally
natural, and with equal beauty.</P>

of language and manner of self-commendation so remarkable in al∣most
all the speeches of <HI>Nestor:</HI> this is to be ascrib'd to the na∣ture

<P>I will only add, that the reason why <HI>Homer</HI> describes <HI>Laertes</HI>
enlarg'd with strength and majesty by <HI>Minerva</HI> is to reconcile
the future story to probability; <HI>Laertes</HI> acts the Heroe, engages
at the head of his friends, and kills the leader of his enemies;
this might appear to be an exploit too great for a weak old man
wasted away with sorrows: the Poet therefore knowing that he
had lost his natural vigour thro' age, supplies the defect with pre∣ternatural
strength, and by this method renders him equal to his
future actions.</P>

There is great art in the speeches of <HI>Medon</HI> and <HI>Eupithes: Eupi∣thes</HI>
said that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had slain the bravest of the <HI>Greeks; Medon</HI>
allows it, but adds, that it was done by the will of the Gods:
the consequence therefore is, that to fight against <HI>Ulysses</HI> upon
this account, is to fight against the Gods. <HI>Eupithes</HI> applies to
their revenge, <HI>Medon</HI> to their fears; <HI>Eupithes</HI> sheds tears to move
their compassion, <HI>Medon</HI> intimidates them by averring that the
assistance of the Gods was visible on the side of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> The
persons likewise whom <HI>Homer</HI> employs to plead against <HI>Eupithes</HI>
are well chosen; <HI>Halitherses</HI> is a Prophet, <HI>Medon</HI> an Herald, and
both persons esteem'd sacred by their offices; this is the reason
why the <HI>Greeks</HI> are said to be struck with awe at their appearance.</P>

<P>VERSE 518.—Halitherses <HI>spoke.</HI>] The speech
of <HI>Medon</HI> had a good effect upon the audience; for <HI>Homer</HI> adds,
that the whole assembly grew afraid; <HI>Halitherses</HI> perceiv'd it, and
seconds it. He insists upon a new head of persuasion, and sets
forth the justice of the late action of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> the Suitors were
slain (says he) for their crimes, and you are guilty for not re∣straining
their outrages; and then to deter them from their pre∣sent
designs, he represents their danger in engaging against their
King. From these speeches (observes <HI>Eustathius</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> draws
the probability of the future part of the story; he divides the
enemy, and wins over almost half of their numbers; whereas,
had they proceeded unanimously, <HI>Ulysses</HI> must necessarily have pe∣rish'd
by their power.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="277"/>
It is observable, that tho' <HI>Phemius</HI> accompanies <HI>Medon,</HI> yet he
is silent; the reason is, he as it were speaks by the mouth of
<HI>Medon,</HI> he was witness to the assistance of heav'n on the part
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and approves and confirms by his presence the truth
of his testimony. It is thus on the stage where the whole Cho∣rus

to give importance to the conclusive action of his Poem, intro∣duces

for the re-establishment of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> In the conclusion of it,
we see <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself rewarding the virtue and bravery of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>

carry'd on with great judgment: we are fully satisfy'd that the
action of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is compleated in the happiness of the Heroe,
when we hear <HI>Jupiter</HI> giving his sanction to it. Besides, it
leaves a noble image of the greatness of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and of the
whole story of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> upon the Reader's mind, when we see
it is of such weight as to engage <HI>Jupiter</HI> in its favour. Thus in
imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> toward the conclusion of the <HI>Aeneid, Virgil</HI>

The design of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is to shew virtue rewarded, and vice
punish'd; here, to introduce this act of justice with the greater
solemnity, <HI>Jupiter</HI> is represented giving his assent to it: “Let
there be peace (says that Deity) but let justice be done, and the

the equity of the cause of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> when he hears <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself
directing in it. Besides, this conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> presents us with
an excellent moral; it shews us that the Deity is the governour
of human affairs, and arbiter of peace and war; as he directs,
the scenes of blood are open'd or clos'd, and the words of <HI>Homer,</HI>

consisted of ten persons under the direction of <HI>Dolius, Laertes,</HI>
and <HI>Ulysses:</HI> How many were under <HI>Eupithes</HI> is uncertain, we
therefore are at liberty to suppose them more or less superior
in number; <HI>Medon</HI> and <HI>Halitherses</HI> had withdrawn almost half
of his assistants, and by that method reduc'd the enemy to a
greater equality: it is probable that they had no very extraor∣dinary
inequality, for the onset is so sudden, that the friends of
the dead Suitors could not have time to embody; besides, it
appears from the sixteenth <HI>Odyssey,</HI> that of the whole band of
Suitors, twelve only were <HI>Ithacans,</HI> the rest came from the ad∣jacent
Islands, and therefore none of their friends could as yet
be arriv'd to assist <HI>Eupithes,</HI> and consequently this party con∣sisted
solely of <HI>Ithacans,</HI> and were not perhaps greatly superior to
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> This observation likewise furnishes us with a reason why
the enemy was so easily defeated, by so small a body of men as

The meaning of the passage is no more than this, when stript
of its poetical ornaments: <HI>Mentor,</HI> a person of great wisdom,
acts as a mediator between the King and his subjects, he regu∣lates
the conditions of peace, and ratifies it with sacrifices to
the Gods; this being an act of wisdom, Poetry ascribes it to
<HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P>I must observe with what dignity <HI>Homer</HI> concludes the <HI>Odys∣sey:</HI>
To honour his Heroe, he introduces two Deities, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
and <HI>Pallas,</HI> who interest themselves in his cause: He then
paints <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the boldest colours, as he rushes upon the enemy
with the utmost intrepidity, and his courage is so ungoverna∣ble,
that <HI>Jupiter</HI> is forc'd to restrain it with his thunder. It is
usual for Orators to reserve the strongest arguments for the
conclusion, that they may leave them fresh upon the Reader's
memory; <HI>Homer</HI> uses the same conduct, he represents his He∣roe
in all his terror, he shews him to be irresistible, and by
this method leaves us fully possest with a noble idea of his
magnanimity.</P>
<P>It has been already observ'd, that the End of the action of
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is the re-establishment of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in full peace and
tranquillity, this is not effected, till the defeat of the Suitors'
friends: and therefore if the Poet had concluded before this
event, the <HI>Odyssey</HI> had been imperfect. It was necessary that
the Reader should not only be inform'd of the return of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
to his country, and the punishment of the Suitors, but
<PB N="285" REF="280"/>
of his re-establishment by a peaceful possession of his regal
authority; which is not executed, till these last disorders rais'd
by <HI>Eupithes</HI> are settled by the victory of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and therefore
this is the natural conclusion of the action.</P>
<P>This book opens with the morning, and ends before night,
so that the whole story of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is comprehended in the
compass of one and forty days. Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> upon <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
remarks, that an Epic Poem ought not to be too long:
we should be able to retain all the several parts of it at once
in our memory: If we lose the idea of the beginning when we
come to the conclusion, it is an argument that it is of too
large an extent, and its Length destroys its Beauty. What
seems to favour this decision is, that the <HI>Aeneid, Iliad,</HI> and
<HI>Odyssey</HI> are conformable to this rule of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and eve∣ry
one of those Poems may be read in the compass of a
single day.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the Collections upon the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
and laid together what occurred most remarkable in this excel∣lent
Poem. I am not so vain as to think these Remarks free
from faults, nor so disingenuous as not to confess them: All
Writers have occasion for indulgence, and those most who least
acknowledge it. I have sometimes used Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> as she
has done others, in transcribing some of her Remarks without
particularizing them; but indeed it was through inadvertency
only that her name is sometimes omitted at the bottom of the
note. If my performance has merit, either in these, or in my
part of the translation (namely in the sixth, eleventh, and eighteenth
books) it is but just to attribute it to the judgment and care
of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> by whose hand every sheet was corrected. His
other, and much more able assistant, was Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> in the fourth
and the twentieth books. It was our particular request, that our
several parts might not be made known to the world till the
end of the work; and if they have had the good fortune not to
be distinguished from His, we ought to be the less vain of it, since
<PB N="286" REF="281"/>
the resemblance proceeds much less from our diligence and study
to copy his manner, than from his own daily revisal and corre∣ction.
The most experienced Painters will not wonder at this,
who very well know, that no Critic can pronounce even of the
pieces of <HI>Raphael</HI> or <HI>Titian,</HI> which have, or which have not, been
worked upon by those of their school? when the same Master's
hand has directed the execution of the whole, reduced it to
one character and colouring, gone over the several parts, and
given to each their finishing.</P>
<P>I must not conclude without declaring our mutual satisfacti∣on
in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s acceptance of our best endeavours, which have
contributed at least to his more speedy execution of this great
undertaking. If ever My name be numbred with the learned,
I must ascribe it to his friendship, in transmitting it to posterity
by a participation in his labours. May the sense I have of this,
and other instances of that friendship, be known as long as
His name will cause mine to last: And may I to this end be per∣mitted,
at the conclusion of a work which is a kind of monu∣ment
of his partiality to me, to place the following lines, as an
Inscription memorial of it.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. POPE.</BYLINE>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Cannot dismiss this work without a few
observations on the true Character and
Style of it. Whoever reads the Odyssey
with an eye to the Iliad, expecting
to find it of the same character, or
of the same sort of spirit, will be grievously deceiv∣ed,
and err against the first principle of Criti∣cism,
which is to consider the nature of the piece,
and the intent of its author. The Odyssey is a
moral and political work, instructive to all degrees
of men, and filled with images examples and pre∣cepts,
of civil and domestic life. <HI>Homer</HI> is here a
person
<Q><L><HI>Qui didicit</HI> patriae <HI>quid debeat, &amp; quid</HI> amicis,</L>
<L><HI>Quo sit amore</HI> parens, <HI>quo</HI> frater <HI>amandus, &amp;</HI> hospes:</L>
<L><HI>Qui quid sit</HI> pulcrum, <HI>quid</HI> turpe, <HI>quid</HI> utile, <HI>quid</HI> non,</L>
<L>Plenius &amp; melius Chrysippo &amp; Crantore dicit.</L></Q>
The Odyssey is the reverse of the Iliad, in <HI>Moral,
Subject, Manner</HI> and <HI>Style;</HI> to which it has no sort
<PB N="290" REF="285"/>
of relation, but as the story happens to follow in
order of time, and as some of the same persons
are actors in it. Yet from this incidental connexi∣on
many have been mis-led to regard it as a con∣tinuation
or second part, and thence to expect a
parity of character inconsistent with its nature.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the common Reader
should fall into this mistake, when so great a
Critic as <HI>Longinus</HI> seems not wholly free from it.
Although what he has said has been generally un∣derstood
to import a severer censure of the Odys∣sey
than it really does, if we consider the occasi∣on
on which it is introduced, and the circumstan∣ces
to which it is confined.</P>
<P>“The Odyssey (says he) is an instance, how na∣tural
it is to a great Genius, when it begins
to grow old and decline, to delight it self in
<HI>Narrations</HI> and <HI>Fables.</HI> For, that <HI>Homer</HI>
composed the Odyssey after the Iliad, many
proofs may be given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From hence in my
judgment it proceeds, that as the Iliad was writ∣ten
while his <HI>Spirit</HI> was in its greatest vigor, the
whole structure of that work is Dramatick and full
of action; whereas the greater part of the O∣dyssey
is employ'd in Narration, which is the taste
of <HI>Old Age:</HI> So that in this latter piece we may
compare him to the setting Sun, which has still
<PB N="291" REF="286"/>
the same greatness but not the same ardor, or
force. He speaks not in the same strain; we
see no more that <HI>Sublime</HI> of the Iliad which
marches on with a constant pace, without ever
being stopp'd, or retarded: there appears no
more that hurry and that strong tyde of mo∣tions
and passions, pouring one after another:
there is no more the same fury, or the same
volubility of diction, so suitable to action, and
all along drawing in such innumerable images of
nature. But <HI>Homer,</HI> like the Ocean, is always
great, even when he ebbs and retires; even when
he is lowest and loses himself most in Narra∣tions
and incredible Fictions: As instances of this,
we cannot forget the descriptions of tempests,
the adventures of <HI>Ʋlysses</HI> with the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and
many others. But tho' all this be <HI>Age,</HI> it is
the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>—And it may be said
for the credit of these fictions, that they are
<HI>beautiful Dreams,</HI> or if you will, the <HI>Dreams
of</HI> Jupiter <HI>himself.</HI> I spoke of the Odyssey on∣ly
to show, that the greatest Poets when
their genius wants strength and warmth for the
<HI>Pathetic,</HI> for the most part employ themselves
in painting the <HI>Manners.</HI> This <HI>Homer</HI> has done,
in characterizing the Suitors, and describing their
way of life; which is properly a branch of Co∣medy,
<PB N="292" REF="287"/>
whose peculiar business it is to represent
the manners of men.”</P>
<P>We must first observe, it is the <HI>Sublime</HI> of which
<HI>Longinus</HI> is writing: That, and not the nature of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem, is his subject. After having highly
extoll'd the sublimity and fire of the Iliad, he justly
observes the Odyssey to have less of those qualities,
and to turn more on the side of moral, and refle∣ctions
on human life. Nor is it his business here to
determine, whether the <HI>elevated spirit</HI> of the one,
or the <HI>just moral</HI> of the other, be the greater ex∣cellence
in it self.</P>
<P>Secondly, that fire and fury of which he is speak∣ing,
can not well be meant of the general Spirit and
Inspiration which is to run through a whole Epic
Poem, but of that particular warmth and impe∣tuosity
necessary in some parts, to image or
represent actions or passions, of haste, tumult, and
violence. It is on occasion of citing some such
particular passages in <HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Longinus</HI> breaks
into this reflection; which seems to determine his
meaning chiefly to that sense.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he affirms the Odyssey to have
less sublimity and fire than the Iliad, but he does
not say it wants the sublime or wants fire. He
affirms it to be narrative, but not that the nar∣ration
is defective. He affirms it to abound in
<PB N="293" REF="288"/>
fictions, not that those fictions are ill invented, or
ill executed. He affirms it to be nice and parti∣cular
in painting the manners, but not that those
manners are ill painted. If <HI>Homer</HI> has fully in these
points accomplish'd his own design, and done all
that the nature of his Poem demanded or allowed,
it still remains perfect in its kind, and as much
a master-piece as the Iliad.</P>
<P>The Amount of the passage is this; that in his
own particular taste, and with respect to the <HI>Sub∣lime,
Longinus</HI> preferr'd the Iliad: And because the
Odyssey was less active and lofty, he judged it the
work of the old age of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>If this opinion be true, it will only prove, that
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Age might determine him in the choice of
his subject, but not that it affected him in the ex∣ecution
of it: And that which would be a very wrong
instance to prove the decay of his Imagination, is a
very good one to evince the strength of his Judg∣ment.
For had he (as Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> observes) com∣pos'd
the Odyssey in his youth, and the Iliad in his
age, both must in reason have been exactly the
same as they now stand. To blame <HI>Homer</HI> for his
choice of such a subject, as did not admit the same
incidents and the same pomp of style as his for∣mer;
is to take offence at too much variety, and
to imagine, that when a man has written one
<PB N="294" REF="289"/>
good thing, he must ever after only copy him∣self.</P>
<P>The <HI>Battle of</HI> Constantine, and the <HI>School of</HI> A∣thens,
are both pieces of <HI>Raphael:</HI> Shall we censure
the School of <HI>Athens</HI> as faulty, because it has not the
fury and fire of the other? or shall we say, that <HI>Ra∣phael</HI>
was grown grave and old, because he chose to
represent the manners of old men and Philosophers?
There is all the silence, tranquillity and composure
in the one, and all the warmth, hurry and tumult
in the other, which the subject of either required:
both of them had been imperfect, if they had not
been as they are. And let the Painter or Poet
be young or old, who designs and performs in this
manner, it proves him to have made the piece at
a time of life when he was master not only of his
art, but of his discretion.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> makes no such distinction between the
two Poems: He constantly cites them with equal
praise, and draws the rules and examples of Epic
writing equally from both. But it is rather to the
Odyssey that <HI>Horace</HI> gives the preference, in the E∣pistle
to <HI>Lollius,</HI> and in the Art of Poetry. It is
remarkable how opposite his opinion is to that of
<HI>Longinus;</HI> and that the particulars he chuses to ex∣toll,
are those very <HI>fictions</HI> and <HI>pictures of the man∣ners</HI>
which the other seems least to approve. Those
<PB N="295" REF="290"/>
fables and manners are of the very essence of the
work: But even without that regard, the fables them∣selves
have both more invention and more instruction,
and the manners more moral and example, than those
of the Iliad.</P>
<P>In some points (and those the most essential to
the Epic Poem) the Odyssey is confessed to excel the
Iliad; and principally in the great end of it, the <HI>Mo∣ral.</HI>
The conduct, turn, and disposition of the <HI>Fable</HI>
is also what the Criticks allow to be the better
model for Epic writers to follow: Accordingly we
find much more of the Cast of this Poem than of the
other in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and (what next to that is perhaps
the greatest example) in the <HI>Telemachus.</HI> In the <HI>Man∣ners,</HI>
it is no way inferior: <HI>Longinus</HI> is so far from
finding any defect in these, that he rather taxes <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
with painting them too minutely. As to
the <HI>Narrations,</HI> although they are more nume∣rous
as the occasions are more frequent, yet they
carry no more the marks of old age, and are neither
more prolix nor more circumstantial, than the con∣versations
and dialogues of the Iliad. Not to men∣tion
the length of those of <HI>Phaenix</HI> in the ninth book,
and of <HI>Nestor</HI> in the eleventh (which may be thought
in compliance to their characters) those of <HI>Glaucus</HI>
in the sixth, of <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the twentieth, and some
others, must be allow'd to exceed any in the whole
<PB N="296" REF="291"/>
Odyssey. And that the propriety of style, and the
numbers, in the Narrations of each are equal, will
appear to any who compare them.</P>
<P>To form a right judgment, whether the Genius
of <HI>Homer</HI> had suffer'd any decay; we must consi∣der,
in both his poems, such parts as are of a simi∣lar
nature, and will bear comparison. And it is
certain we shall find in each, the same vivacity and
fecundity of invention, the same life and strength of
imaging and colouring, the particular descriptions
as highly painted, the figures as bold, the metaphors
as animated, and the numbers as harmonious and
as various.</P>
<P>The Odyssey is a perpetual source of Poetry: The
stream is not the less full, for being gentle; tho' it
is true (when we speak only with regard to the <HI>Sub∣lime</HI>)
that a river, foaming and thund'ring in cataracts
from rocks and precipices, is what more strikes, a∣mazes
and fills the mind, than the same body of
water, flowing afterwards thro' peaceful vales and
agreeable scenes of pasturage.</P>
<P>The Odyssey (as I have before said) ought to be
consider'd according to its own nature and design,
not with an eye to the Iliad. To censure <HI>Homer</HI>
because it is unlike what it was never meant to re∣semble,
is, as if a Gardiner who had purposely cul∣tivated
two beautiful trees of contrary natures, as a
<PB N="297" REF="292"/>
specimen of his skill in the several kinds, should
be blamed for not bringing them into <HI>pairs;</HI> when
in root, stem, leaf, and flower, each was so entirely
different, that one must have been spoil'd in the en∣deavour
to match the other.</P>
<P><HI>Longinus,</HI> who saw this Poem was “<HI>partly of the
nature of Comedy,</HI>” ought not for that very reason
to have consider'd it with a view to the Iliad. How
little any such resemblance was the intention of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
may appear from hence, that although the
character of <HI>Ʋlysses</HI> there was already drawn, yet
here he purposely turns to another side of it,
and shows him not in that full light of glory but
in the shade of common life, with a mixture of
such qualities as are requisite to all the lowest acci∣dents
of it, strugling with misfortunes, and on a
level with the meanest of mankind. As for the o∣ther
persons, none of them are above what we call
the higher Comedy: <HI>Calypso,</HI> tho' a Goddess, is a
character of intrigue; the <HI>Suitors</HI> are yet more
approaching to it; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> are of the same
cast; the <HI>Cyclops, Melanthius,</HI> and <HI>Irus,</HI> descend
even to droll characters: and the scenes that appear
throughout, are generally of the comic kind; ban∣quets,
revels, sports, loves, and the pursuit of a
woman.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="293"/>
From the Nature of the Poem, we shall form an
Idea of the <HI>Style.</HI> The diction is to follow the ima∣ges,
and to take its colour from the complexion of
the thoughts. Accordingly the Odyssey is not al∣ways
cloath'd in the majesty of verse proper to Tra∣gedy,
but sometimes descends into the plainer Narra∣tive,
and sometimes even to that familiar dialogue es∣sential
to Comedy. However, where it cannot sup∣port
a sublimity, it always preserves a dignity, or at
least a propriety.</P>
<P>There is a real beauty in an easy, pure, perspi∣cuous
description even of a <HI>low action.</HI> There are
numerous instances of this both in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Vir∣gil;</HI>
and perhaps those natural passages are not the
least pleasing of their works. It is often the same
in History, where the representations of common, or
even domestic things, in clear, plain, and natural
words, are frequently found to make the liveliest
impression on the reader.</P>
<P>The question is, how far a Poet, in pursuing the
description or image of an action, can attach himself
to <HI>little circumstances,</HI> without vulgarity or trifling?
what particulars are proper, and enliven the image;
or what are impertinent, and clog it? In this matter
Painting is to be consulted, and the whole regard
had to those circumstances which contribute to form
a full, and yet not a confused, idea of the thing.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="294"/>
<HI>Epithets</HI> are of vast service to this effect, and the
right use of these is often the only expedient to ren∣der
the narration poetical.</P>
<P>The great point of judgment is to distinguish
when to speak simply, and when figuratively: But
whenever the Poet is oblig'd by the nature of his
subject to descend to the lower manner of wri∣ting,
an elevated style would be affected, and
therefore ridiculous; and the more he was forc'd up∣on
figures and metaphors to avoid that lowness, the
more the image would be broken, and consequenly
obscure.</P>
<P>One may add, that the use of the grand style on
little subjects, is not only ludicrous, but a sort of
transgression against the rules of proportion and me∣chanicks:
'Tis using a vast force to lift a <HI>feather.</HI></P>
<P>I believe, now I am upon this head, it will be
found a just observation, that the <HI>low actions of life</HI>
cannot be put into a figurative style without being ri∣diculous,
but <HI>things natural</HI> can. Metaphors raise
the latter into Dignity, as we see in the <HI>Georgicks;</HI>
but throw the former into Ridicule, as in the <HI>Lutrin.</HI>
I think this may very well be accounted for: Laugh∣ter
implies censure; inanimate and irrational beings
are not objects of censure; therefore these may be
elevated as much as you please, and no ridicule fol∣lows:
but when rational beings are represented above
<PB N="300" REF="295"/>
their real character, it becomes ridiculous in Art,
because it is vicious in Morality. The <HI>Bees</HI> in <HI>Vir∣gil,</HI>
were they rational beings, would be ridiculous
by having their actions and manners represented on
a level with creatures so superior as men; since it
would imply folly or pride, which are the proper ob∣jects
of Ridicule.</P>
<P>The use of pompous expression for low actions or
thoughts is the <HI>true Sublime</HI> of <HI>Don Quixote.</HI> How
far unfit it is for Epic Poetry, appears in its being
the perfection of the Mock-Epick. It is so far
from being the Sublime of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> that it is the
cause of all <HI>Bombaste;</HI> when Poets instead of being
(as they imagine) constantly lofty, only preserve
throughout a painful equality of fustian: That con∣tinu'd
swell of language (which runs indiscriminately
even thro' their lowest characters, and rattles like
some mightiness of meaning in the most indiffe∣rent
subjects) is of a piece with that perpetual
elevation of tone which the Players have learn∣ed
from it; and which is not <HI>speaking,</HI> but <HI>vocife∣rating.</HI></P>
<P>There is still more reason for a variation of style
in <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry than in <HI>Tragic,</HI> to distinguish be∣tween
that <HI>Language of the Gods</HI> proper to the <HI>Muse</HI>
who sings, and is inspir'd; and that of <HI>Men</HI> who are
introduced speaking only according to nature. Far∣ther,
<PB N="301" REF="296"/>
there ought to be a difference of style ob∣serv'd
in the speeches of human persons, and those
of Deities; and again, in those which may be called
set harangues or orations, and those which are only
conversation or dialogue. <HI>Homer</HI> has more of the latter
than any other Poet: what <HI>Virgil</HI> does by two or three
words of narration, <HI>Homer</HI> still performs by speeches:
Not only replies, but even rejoynders are frequent in
him, a practice almost unknown to <HI>Virgil.</HI> This ren∣ders
his Poems more animated, but less grave and ma∣jestic;
and consequently necessitates the frequent use
of a lower style. The writers of Tragedy lye under the
same necessity, if they would copy nature; whereas
that painted and poetical diction which they perpetually
use, would be improper even in Orations design'd to
move with all the arts of Rhetorick: This is plain
from the practice of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero;</HI> and
<HI>Virgil</HI> in those of <HI>Drances</HI> and <HI>Turnus</HI> gives an e∣minent
example, how far remov'd the style of them
ought to be from such an excess of figures and or∣naments:
which indeed fits only that <HI>Language of
the Gods</HI> we have been speaking of, or that of a
<HI>Muse</HI> under inspiration.</P>
<P>To read thro' a whole work in this strain, is like
travelling all along on the ridge of a hill; which is
not half so agreeable as sometimes gradually to rise,
and sometimes gently to descend, as the way leads,
and as the end of the journey directs.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="297"/>
Indeed the true reason that so few Poets have imi∣tated
<HI>Homer</HI> in these lower parts, has been the ex∣treme
difficulty of preserving that mixture of Ease
and Dignity essential to them. For it is as hard for an
Epic Poem to stoop to the Narrative with success, as
for a Prince to descend to be familiar, without dimi∣nution
to his greatness.</P>
<P>The <HI>sublime</HI> style is more easily counterfeited than
the <HI>natural;</HI> something that passes for it, or sounds
like it, is common in all false writers: But nature,
purity, perspicuity, and simplicity, never walk in the
clouds; they are obvious to all capacities; and
where they are not evident, they do not exist.</P>
<P>The most plain Narration not only admits of these,
and of harmony (which are all the qualities of style)
but it requires every one of them to render it plea∣sing.
On the contrary, whatever pretends to a
share of the Sublime, may pass notwithstanding any
defects in the rest, nay sometimes without any of them,
and gain the admiration of all ordinary readers.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> in his lowest narrations or speeches is e∣ver
easy, flowing, copious, clear, and harmonious.
He shows not less <HI>invention,</HI> in assembling the hum∣bler,
than the greater, thoughts and images; nor less
<HI>judgment,</HI> in proportioning the style and the versifica∣tion
to these, than to the other. Let it be remem∣ber'd,
that the same Genius that soar'd the highest,
<PB N="303" REF="298"/>
and from whom the greatest models of the <HI>Sublime</HI>
are derived, was also he who stoop'd the lowest, and
gave to the simple <HI>Narrative</HI> its utmost perfection.
Which of these was the harder task to <HI>Homer</HI>
himself, I cannot pretend to determine; but to his
Translator I can affirm (however unequal all his
imitations must be) that of the latter has been much
the more difficult.</P>
<P>Whoever expects here the same pomp of verse,
and the same ornaments of diction, as in the Iliad;
he will, and he ought to be disappointed. Were the
original otherwise, it had been an offence against na∣ture;
and were the translation so, it were an offence
against <HI>Homer,</HI> which is the same thing.</P>
<P>It must be allow'd that there is a majesty and
harmony in the <HI>Greek</HI> language which greatly con∣tribute
to elevate and support the narration. But
I must also observe that this is an advantage grown
upon the language since <HI>Homer</HI>'s time; for things are
remov'd from vulgarity by being out of use: And
if the words we could find in any present language
were equally sonorous or musical in themselves,
they would still appear less poetical and uncommon
than those of a dead one from this only circum∣stance,
of being in every man's mouth. I may add
to this another disadvantage to a Translator, from a
different cause: <HI>Homer</HI> seems to have taken upon
<PB N="304" REF="299"/>
him the character of an Historian, Antiquary, Di∣vine,
and Professor of Arts and Sciences; as well
as a Poet. In one or other of these characters he
descends into many particularities, which as a Poet
only perhaps he would have avoided. All these
ought to be preserv'd by a faithful Translator, who
in some measure takes the place of <HI>Homer;</HI> and all
that can be expected from him is to make them as
poetical as the subject will bear. Many arts there∣fore
are requisite to supply these disadvantages, in
order to dignify and solemnize these plainer parts,
which hardly admit of any poetical ornaments.</P>
<P>Some use has been made to this end, of the style
of <HI>Milton.</HI> A just and moderate mixture of old
words may have an effect like the working old Abbey
stones into a building, which I have sometimes seen
to give a kind of venerable air, and yet not destroy
the neatness, elegance, and equality requisite to a
new work; I mean without rendring it too unfami∣liar,
or remote from the present purity of writing, or
from that ease and smoothness which ought always
to accompany Narration or Dialogue. In reading
a style judiciously antiquated, one finds a pleasure
not unlike that of travelling on an old <HI>Roman</HI> way:
but then the road must be as <HI>good,</HI> as the way is
<HI>ancient;</HI> the style must be such in which we may
evenly proceed, without being put to short stops by
<PB N="305" REF="300"/>
sudden abruptnesses, or puzled by frequent turnings
and transpositions: No man delights in furrows and
stumbling-blocks: And let our love to Antiquity
be ever so great, a fine ruin is one thing, and a heap
of rubbish another. The imitators of <HI>Milton,</HI> like
most other imitators, are not <HI>Copies</HI> but <HI>Caricatura's</HI>
of their original; they are a hundred times more
obsolete and cramp than he, and equally so in all
places: Whereas it should have been observed of
<HI>Milton,</HI> that he is not lavish of his exotick words
and phrases every where alike, but employs them
much more where the subject is marvellous vast
and strange, as in the scenes of Heaven, Hell,
Chaos, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than where it is turn'd to the natural
and agreeable, as in the pictures of Paradise, the
loves of our first parents, the entertainments of
Angels, and the like. In general, this unusual style
better serves to awaken our ideas in the descriptions
and in the imaging and picturesque parts, than it
agrees with the lower sort of narrations, the character
of which is simplicity and purity. <HI>Milton</HI> has se∣veral
of the latter, where we find not an antiquated
affected or uncouth word, for some hundred lines
together; as in his fifth book, the latter part of
the eighth, the former of the tenth and eleventh
books, and in the narration of <HI>Michael</HI> in the twelfth.
I wonder indeed that he, who ventur'd (contrary
<PB N="306" REF="301"/>
to the practice of all other Epic Poets) to imitate
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Lownesses in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> should not also
have copied his plainness and perspicuity in the
<HI>Dramatic</HI> parts: Since in his speeches (where clear∣ness
above all is necessary) there is frequently such
transposition and forced construction, that the
very sense is not to be discover'd without a second or
third reading: And in this certainly he ought to
be no example.</P>
<P>To preserve the true character of <HI>Homer</HI>'s style
in the present translation, great pains has been taken
to be easy and natural. The chief merit I can
pretend to, is, not to have been carried into a
more plausible and figurative manner of writing,
which would better have pleased all readers, but the
judicious ones. My errors had been fewer, had
each of those Gentlemen who join'd with me
shown as much of the severity of a friend to me,
as I did to them, in a strict animadversion and cor∣rection.
What assistance I receiv'd from them, was
made known in general to the publick in the origi∣nal
Proposals for this work, and the particulars
are specify'd at the conclusion of it; to which I
must add (to be punctually just) some part of the
tenth and fifteenth books. The Reader will
now be too good a judge, how much the
greater part of it, and consequently of its faults, is
<PB N="307" REF="302"/>
chargeable upon me alone. But this I can with in∣tegrity
affirm, that I have bestowed as much time
and pains upon the whole, as were consistent with
the indispensable duties and cares of life, and with
that wretched state of health which God has been
pleased to make my portion. At the least, it is a
pleasure to me to reflect, that I have introduced
into our language this other work of the great∣est
and most ancient of Poets, with some dignity;
and I hope, with as little disadvantage as the Iliad.
And if, after the unmerited success of that translati∣on,
any one will wonder why I would enterprize
the Odyssey? I think it a sufficient answer to say,
that <HI>Homer</HI> himself did the same, or the world would
never have seen it.</P>
<P>I design'd to have ended this Postscript here;
but since I am now taking my leave of <HI>Homer,</HI> and
of all controversy relating to him, I beg leave to
be indulg'd if I make use of this last opportunity,
to say a very few words about some reflections which
the late Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> bestow'd on the first part
of my Preface to the Iliad, and which she publish'd
at the end of her translation of that Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seconde Edition, a Paris, 1719.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To write gravely an answer to them would be
too much for the reflections; and to say nothing
<PB N="308" REF="303"/>
concerning them, would be too little for the Au∣thor.
It is owing to the industry of that learned
Lady, that our polite neighbours are become ac∣quainted
with many of <HI>Homer</HI>'s beauties, which were
hidden from them before in <HI>Greek</HI> and in <HI>Eusta∣thius.</HI>
She challenges on this account a particular
regard from all the admirers of that great Poet,
and I hope that I shall be thought, as I mean, to
pay some part of this debt to her memory in what
I am now writing.</P>
<P>Had these reflections fallen from the pen of an
ordinary Critick, I should not have apprehended
their effect, and should therefore have been silent
concerning them: but since they are Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI>'s,
I imagine that they must be of weight; and
in a case where I think her Reasoning very bad, I re∣spect
her Authority.</P>
<P>I have fought under Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>'s banner,
and have wag'd war in defence of the divine <HI>Homer</HI>
against all the Hereticks of the age. And yet it is
Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> who accuses me, and who accuses
me of nothing less than betraying our common
Cause. She affirms that the most declar'd enemies
of this Author have never said any thing against
him more injurious or more unjust than I.
What must the world think of me, after such
a judgment pass'd by so great a Critick? the
<PB N="309" REF="304"/>
world, who decides so often, and who examines so
seldom; the world, who even in matters of littera∣ture
is almost always the slave of Authority? Who
will suspect that so much learning should mistake,
that so much accuracy should be mis-led, or that
so much candour should be byass'd?</P>
<P>All this however has happen'd, and Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI>'s
Criticisms on my Preface flow from the very
same error, from which so many false criticisms of
her countrymen upon <HI>Homer</HI> have flow'd, and
which she has so justly and so severely reprov'd; I
mean the error of depending on injurious and un∣skilful
<HI>translations.</HI></P>
<P>An indifferent translation may be of some use,
and a good one will be of a great deal. But I think
that no translation ought to be the ground of <HI>Cri∣ticism,</HI>
because no man ought to be condemn'd up∣on
another man's explanation of his meaning: Could
<HI>Homer</HI> have had the honour of explaining his, before
that august Tribunal where Monsieur <HI>de la Motte</HI> pre∣sides,
I make no doubt but he had escap'd many
of those severe animadversions with which some
<HI>French</HI> Authors have loaded him, and from which
even Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>'s translation of the Iliad could
not preserve him.</P>
<P>How unhappy was it for me, that the knowledge
of our <HI>Island-tongue</HI> was as necessary to Madam
<PB N="310" REF="305"/>
<HI>Dacier</HI> in my case, as the knowledge of <HI>Greek</HI> was
to Monsieur <HI>de la Motte</HI> in that of our great Au∣thor;
or to any of those whom she styles <HI>blind Cen∣surers,</HI>
and blames for condemning what they did
not understand.</P>
<P>I may say with modesty, that she knew less of
my true sense from that faulty translation of part
of my Preface, than those blind censurers might
have known of <HI>Homer</HI>'s even from the translation of
<HI>la Valterie,</HI> which preceded her own.</P>
<P>It pleas'd me however to find, that her objecti∣ons
were not level'd at the general Doctrine, or at
any essentials of my Preface, but only at a few par∣ticular
expressions. She propos'd little more than
(to use her own phrase) to <HI>combate two or three Si∣miles;</HI>
and I hope that to combate a Simile is no
more than to fight with a shadow, since a Simile is
no better than the shadow of an Argument.</P>
<P>She lays much weight where I lay'd but little, and
examines with more scrupulosity than I writ, or than
perhaps the matter requires.</P>
<P>These unlucky Similes taken by themselves may
perhaps render my meaning equivocal to an igno∣rant
translator; or there may have fallen from my
pen some expressions, which taken by themselves
likewise, may to the same person have the same ef∣fect.
But if the translator had been master of our
<PB N="311" REF="306"/>
tongue, the general tenor of my argument, that
which precedes and that which follows the passages
objected to, would have sufficiently determined him
as to the precise meaning of them: And if Ma∣dam
<HI>Dacier</HI> had taken up her pen a little more lei∣surely,
or had employ'd it with more temper, she
would not have answered Paraphrases of her own,
which even the translation will not justify, and which
say more than once the very contrary to what I have
said in the passages themselves.</P>
<P>If any person has curiosity enough to read the
whole paragraphs in my Preface, on some mangled
parts of which these reflections are made, he will ea∣sily
discern that I am as orthodox as Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI>
her self in those very articles on which she treats
me like an Heretick: He will easily see that all the dif∣ference
between us consists in this, that I offer <HI>opini∣ons,</HI>
and she delivers <HI>doctrines;</HI> that my imagination
represents <HI>Homer</HI> as the greatest of human Po∣ets,
whereas in hers he was exalted above humani∣ty;
infallibility and impeccability were two of his
attributes. There was therefore no need of defend∣ing
<HI>Homer</HI> against me, who (if I mistake not) had
carry'd my admiration of him as far as it can be car∣ry'd
without giving a <HI>real</HI> occasion of writing in his
defence.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="307"/>
After answering my harmless Similes, she proceeds
to a matter which does not regard so much the ho∣nour
of <HI>Homer,</HI> as that of the times he liv'd in;
and here I must confess she does not wholly mistake
my meaning, but I think she mistakes the state
of the question. She had said, the Manners of those
times were so much the better the less they were
like ours: I thought this required a little qualificati∣on,
I confest that in my own opinion the world was
mended in some points, such as the custom of put∣ting
whole nations to the sword, condemning Kings
and their families to perpetual slavery, and a few
others. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> judges otherwise in this; but
as to the rest, particularly in preferring the simplicity
of the ancient world to the luxury of ours, which is
the main point contended for, she owns we agree. This
I thought was well, but I am so unfortunate that this
too is taken amiss, and call'd adopting or (if you will)
stealing <HI>her</HI> sentiment. The truth is she might have
said <HI>her words,</HI> for I used them on purpose, being
then professedly, citing from her: tho' I might have
done the same without intending that compliment,
for they are also to be found in <HI>Eustathius,</HI> and the
sentiment I believe is that of all mankind. I cannot
really tell what to say to this whole Remark, only
that in the first part of it Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> is dis∣pleased
that I don't agree with her, and in the last
<PB N="313" REF="308"/>
that I do: But this is a temper which every po∣lite
man should over-look in a Lady.</P>
<P>To punish my ingratitude, she resolves to expose
my blunders, and selects two which I suppose are
the most flagrant, out of the many for which she
could have chastiz'd me. It happens that the first of
these is in part the Translator's, and in part her own,
without any share of mine: She quotes the end of a
sentence, and he puts in <HI>French</HI> what I never wrote in
<HI>English.</HI> “<HI>Homer</HI> (I said) open'd a new and bound∣less
walk for his imagination, and created a world
for himself in the invention of Fable;” which he
translates, <HI>Homere crea pour son usage un monde
mouvant, en inventant la fable.</HI></P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> justly wonders at this nonsense
in me; and I, in the Translator. As to what I
meant by <HI>Homer's</HI> invention of Fable, it is after∣wards
particularly distinguish'd from that extensive
sense in which she took it, by these words. “If
<HI>Homer</HI> was not the first, who introduced the Dei∣ties
(as <HI>Herodotus</HI> imagines) into the religion of
<HI>Greece,</HI> he seems the first who brought them into
<HI>a System of Machinery</HI> for Poetry.</P>
<P>The other blunder she accuses me of is, the
mistaking a passage in <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and she is pleased
to send me back to this Philosopher's treatise of Po∣etry,
and to her Preface on the Odyssey for my
<PB N="314" REF="309"/>
better instruction. Now tho' I am sawcy enough
to think that one may sometimes differ from <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
without blundering, and tho' I am sure one
may sometimes fall into an error by following him ser∣vilely;
yet I own that to quote any Author for what
he never said is a blunder; (but by the way, to cor∣rect
an Author for what he never said, is somewhat
worse than a blunder.) My words were these. “As
there is a greater variety of Characters in the Iliad
than in any other Poem, so there is of Speeches.
Every thing in it has manners, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> expresses
it; That is, every thing is acted or spoken: very
little passes in narration.” She justly says that “E∣very
thing which is acted or spoken, has not necessa∣rily
manners merely because it is acted or spoken.”
Agreed: But I would ask the question, whether any
thing can have manners which is neither acted nor
spoken? if not, then the whole Iliad being almost
spent in speech and action, almost every thing in
it has Manners: since <HI>Homer</HI> has been prov'd be∣fore
in a long paragraph of the Preface, to have ex∣cell'd
in drawing Characters and painting Manners,
and indeed his whole Poem is one continued occa∣sion
of shewing this bright part of his talent.</P>
<P>To speak fairly, it is impossible she could read
even the translation, and take my sense so wrong
as she represents it; but I was first translated igno∣rantly,
<PB N="315" REF="310"/>
and then read partially. My expression in∣deed
was not quite exact; it should have been,
“Every thing has manners as <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls them.”
But such a fault methinks might have been spa∣red,
since if one was to look with that dispositi∣on
she discovers towards me, even on her own
excellent writings, one might find some mistakes
which no context can redress; as where she makes
<HI>Eustathius</HI> call <HI>Cratisthenes</HI> the <HI>Phliasian, Callist∣henes</HI>
the <HI>Physician</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dacier Remarques sur le 4<SUP>me</SUP> livre de l'Odyss.</NOTE>. What a triumph might
some slips of this sort have afforded, to <HI>Homer</HI>'s, hers
and my enemies, from which she was only screen'd
by their happy ignorance? How unlucky had it been,
when she insulted Mr. <HI>de la Motte</HI> for omitting a
material passage in the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De la Corruption du Gout. <HI>pag.</HI> 467.</NOTE> speech of <HI>Helen</HI> to <HI>Hector,
Il.</HI> 6. if some champion for the moderns had by
chance understood so much <HI>Greek,</HI> as to whisper
him, that there was no such passage in <HI>Homer?</HI></P>
<P>Our concern, zeal, and even jealousy, for our great
Author's honour were mutual, our endeavours to ad∣vance
it were equal, and I have as often trembled for it
in her hands, as she could in mine. It was one of the
many reasons I had to wish the longer life of this La∣dy,
that I must certainly have regain'd her good
opinion, in spite of all mis-representing Translators
whatever. I could not have expected it on any other
<PB N="316" REF="311"/>
terms than being approved as great, if not as passio∣nate,
an admirer of <HI>Homer</HI> as her self. For that was
the first condition of her favour and friendship; o∣therwise
not one's Taste alone, but one's Morality
had been corrupted, nor would any man's Religion
have been unsuspected, who did not implicitly be∣lieve
in an Author whose doctrine is so conformable
to holy Scripture. However, as different people have
different ways of expressing their Belief, some purely
by public and general acts of worship, others by a
reverend sort of reasoning and enquiry about the
grounds of it; 'tis the same in Admiration, some
prove it by exclamations, others by respect. I have
observed that the loudest huzza's given to a great
man in a triumph, proceed not from his friends, but
the rabble; and as I have fancy'd it the same with
the rabble of Criticks, a desire to be distinguish'd
from them has turn'd me to the more moderate, and
I hope, more rational method. Tho' I am a Poet,
I would not be an Enthusiast; and tho' I am an
Englishman, I would not be furiously of a Party. I
am far from thinking my self that Genius, upon
whom at the end of these remarks Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>
congratulates my country: One capable of “correct∣ing
<HI>Homer,</HI> and consequently of reforming man∣kind,
and amending this Constitution.” It was
not to <HI>Great Britain</HI> this ought to have been ap∣ply'd,
<PB N="317" REF="312"/>
since our nation has one happiness for
which she might have preferr'd it to her own,
that as much as we abound in other miserable mis∣guided
Sects, we have at least none of the blas∣phemers
of <HI>Homer.</HI> We stedfastly and unanimously
believe, both his Poem, and our Constitution, to be
the best that ever human wit invented: That the one
is not more incapable of amendment than the other;
and (old as they both are) we despise any <HI>French</HI> or
<HI>English</HI> man whatever, who shall presume to retrench,
to innovate, or to make the least alteration in either.
Far therefore from the Genius for which Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI>
mistook me, my whole desire is but to preserve
the humble character of a faithful Translator, and a
quiet Subject.</P>
