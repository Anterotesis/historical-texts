<HEAD>A
FAREWELL,
FOR TWO YEARS, TO
ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SWEET Spring! while others hail thy op'ning
flowers,</L>
<L>The first young hope of Summer's blushing hours;</L>
<L>Me they remind, that when her ardent ray</L>
<L>Shall reach the summit of our lengthen'd day,</L>
<L>Then, ALBION! far from Thee, my cherish'd home,</L>
<L>To foreign climes my pensive steps must roam;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
And twice shall Spring, dispelling Winter's gloom,</L>
<L>Shed o'er thy lovely vales her vernal bloom;</L>
<L>Twice shall thy village-maids, with chaplets gay,</L>
<L>And simple carols, hail returning May;</L>
<L>And twice shall Autumn, o'er thy cultur'd plain,</L>
<L>Pour the rich treasures of his yellow grain;</L>
<L>Twice shall thy happy peasants bear along</L>
<L>The lavish store, and wake the harvest-song;</L>
<L>Ere from the bounded deep my searching eye,</L>
<L>Ah! land belov'd, shall thy white cliffs descry.—</L>
<L>Where the slow Loire, on borders ever gay,</L>
<L>Delights to linger, in his sunny way,</L>
<L>Oft, while I seem to count, with musing glance,</L>
<L>The murm'ring waves that near his brink advance,</L>
<L>My wand'ring thoughts shall seek the grassy side,</L>
<L>Parental Thames! where rolls thy ample tide;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Where, on thy willow'd bank, methinks, appears</L>
<L>Engrav'd the record of my passing years;</L>
<L>Ah! not like thine, their course is gently led,</L>
<L>By zephyrs fann'd, thro' paths with verdure spread;</L>
<L>They flow, as urg'd by storms the mountain rill</L>
<L>Falls o'er the fragments of the rocky hill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My native scenes! can aught in time, or space,</L>
<L>From this fond heart your lov'd remembrance chase?</L>
<L>Link'd to that heart by ties for ever dear,</L>
<L>By Joy's light smile, and Sorrow's tender tear;</L>
<L>By all that ere my anxious hopes employ'd,</L>
<L>By all my soul has suffer'd, or enjoy'd!</L>
<L>Still blended with those well-known scenes, arise</L>
<L>The varying images the past supplies;</L>
<L>The childish sports that fond attention drew,</L>
<L>And charm'd my vacant heart when life was new;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
The harmless mirth, the sadness robb'd of power</L>
<L>To cast its shade beyond the present hour—</L>
<L>And that dear hope which sooth'd my youthful breast,</L>
<L>And show'd the op'ning world in beauty drest;</L>
<L>That hope which seem'd with bright unfolding rays</L>
<L>(Ah, vainly seem'd!) to gild my future days;</L>
<L>That hope which, early wrapp'd in lasting gloom,</L>
<L>Sunk in the cold inexorable tomb!—</L>
<L>And Friendship, ever powerful to controul</L>
<L>The keen emotions of the wounded soul,</L>
<L>To lift the suff'ring spirit from despair,</L>
<L>And bid it feel that life deserves a care.</L>
<L>Still each impression that my heart retains</L>
<L>Is link'd, dear Land! to thee by lasting chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She too, sweet soother of my lonely hours!</L>
<L>Who gilds my thorny path with fancy's flowers,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The Muse, who early taught my willing heart</L>
<L>To feel with transport her prevailing art;</L>
<L>Who deign'd before my infant eyes to spread</L>
<L>Those dazzling visions she alone can shed;</L>
<L>She, who will still be found where'er I stray,</L>
<L>The lov'd companion of my distant way;</L>
<L>'Midst foreign sounds, her voice, that charms my ear,</L>
<L>Breath'd in my native tongue, I still shall hear;</L>
<L>'Midst foreign sounds, endear'd will flow the song</L>
<L>Whose tones, my ALBION, will to thee belong!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when with wonder thrill'd, with mind elate,</L>
<L>I mark the change sublime in GALLIA's state!</L>
<L>Where new-born Freedom treads the banks of Seine,</L>
<L>Hope in her eye, and Virtue in her train!</L>
<L>Pours day upon the dungeon's central gloom,</L>
<L>And leads the captive from his living tomb;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Tears the sharp iron from his loaded breast,</L>
<L>And bids the renovated land be blest—</L>
<L>My thoughts shall fondly turn to that lov'd Isle,</L>
<L>Where Freedom long has shed her genial smile.</L>
<L>Less safe in other lands the triple wall,</L>
<L>And massy portal, of the Gothic hall,</L>
<L>Than in that favour'd Isle the straw-built thatch,</L>
<L>Where Freedom sits, and guards the simple latch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, ALBION! while my heart to thee shall spring,</L>
<L>To thee its first, its best affections bring;</L>
<L>Yet, when I hear exulting millions pour</L>
<L>The shout of triumph on the GALLIC shore;</L>
<L>Not without sympathy my pensive mind</L>
<L>The bounds of human bliss enlarg'd, shall find;</L>
<L>Not without sympathy my glowing breast</L>
<L>Shall hear, on any shore, of millions blest!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Scorning those narrow souls, whate'er their clime,</L>
<L>Who meanly think that sympathy a crime;</L>
<L>Who, if one wish for human good expand</L>
<L>Beyond the limits of their native land,</L>
<L>And from the worst of ills would others free,</L>
<L>Deem that warm wish, my Country! guilt to thee.</L>
<L>Ah! why those blessings to one spot confine,</L>
<L>Which, when diffus'd, will not the less be thine?</L>
<L>Ah! why repine if far those blessings spread</L>
<L>For which so oft thy gen'rous sons have bled?</L>
<L>Shall ALBION mark with scorn the lofty thought,</L>
<L>The love of Liberty, herself has taught?</L>
<L>Shall <HI>her</HI> brave sons, in this enlighten'd age,</L>
<L>Assume the bigot-frown of papal rage,</L>
<L>Nor tolerate the vow to Freedom paid,</L>
<L>If diff'ring from the ritual <HI>they</HI> have made?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Freedom! who oft on ALBION's fost'ring breast</L>
<L>Has found <HI>her</HI> friends in stars and ermine drest,</L>
<L>Allows that some among her chosen race</L>
<L>Should there the claim to partial honours trace,</L>
<L>And in the long-reflected lustre shine</L>
<L>That beams thro' Ancestry's ennobled line;</L>
<L>While she, with guardian wing, can well secure</L>
<L>From each proud wrong the undistinguish'd poor.</L>
<L>On GALLIA's coast, where oft the robe of state</L>
<L>Was trail'd by those whom Freedom's soul must hate;</L>
<L>Where, like a comet, rank appear'd to glow</L>
<L>With dangerous blaze, that threaten'd all below;</L>
<L>There Freedom now, with gladden'd eye, beholds</L>
<L>The simple vest that flows in equal folds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' on Seine's fair banks a transient storm</L>
<L>Flung o'er the darken'd wave its angry form;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
That purifying tempest now has past,</L>
<L>No more the trembling waters feel the blast;</L>
<L>The bord'ring images, confus'dly trac'd</L>
<L>Along the ruffled stream, to order haste;</L>
<L>The vernal day-spring bursts the partial gloom,</L>
<L>And all the landscape glows with fresher bloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When, far around that bright'ning scene, I view</L>
<L>Objects of gen'ral bliss, to GALLIA new;</L>
<L>Then ALBION! shall my soul reflect with pride</L>
<L>Thou wert her leading star, her honour'd guide;</L>
<L>That, long in slav'ry sunk, when taught by thee,</L>
<L>She broke her fetters, and has dar'd be free;</L>
<L>In new-born majesty she seems to rise,</L>
<L>While sudden from the land oppression flies.</L>
<L>So, at the solemn hour of Nature's birth,</L>
<L>When brooding darkness veil'd the beauteous earth,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Heaven's awful mandate pierc'd the solid night,</L>
<L>“Let there be light,” it said, “and there was light!”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! when shall Reason's intellectual ray</L>
<L>Shed o'er the moral world more perfect day?</L>
<L>When shall that gloomy world appear no more</L>
<L>A waste, where desolating tempests roar?</L>
<L>Where savage Discord howls in threat'ning form,</L>
<L>And wild Ambition leads the mad'ning storm;</L>
<L>Where hideous Carnage marks his dang'rous way,</L>
<L>And where the screaming vulture scents his prey?—</L>
<L>Ah! come, blest Concord! chase, with smile serene,</L>
<L>The hostile passions from the human scene!</L>
<L>May Glory's lofty path be found afar</L>
<L>From agonizing groans and crimson war;</L>
<L>And may the ardent mind, that seeks renown,</L>
<L>Claim, not the martial, but the civic crown!</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
While pure Benevolence, with happier views</L>
<L>Of bright success, the gen'ral good pursues;</L>
<L>Ah! why, my Country! with indignant pain,</L>
<L>Why in thy senate did she plead in vain?</L>
<L>Ah! why in vain enforce the Captives' cause,</L>
<L>And urge Humanity's eternal laws?</L>
<L>With fruitless zeal the tale of horror trace,</L>
<L>And ask redress for AFRIC's injur'd race?</L>
<L>Unhappy race! ah! what to them avail'd,</L>
<L>That touching eloquence, whose efforts fail'd?</L>
<L>Tho' in the senate Mercy found combin'd</L>
<L>All who possess the noblest pow'rs of mind,</L>
<L>On other themes, pre-eminently bright,</L>
<L>They shine, like single stars, with sep'rate light;</L>
<L><HI>Here,</HI> only <HI>here,</HI> with intermingled rays,</L>
<L>In one resplendent constellation blaze;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Yes, Captive race! if all the force display'd</L>
<L>By glowing Genius, in Compassion's aid,</L>
<L>When, with that energy she boasts alone,</L>
<L>She made your wrongs, your ling'ring tortures known;</L>
<L>Bade full in view the bloody visions roll,</L>
<L>Shook the firm nerves, and froze the shudd'ring soul!—</L>
<L>As when the sun, in piercing radiance bright,</L>
<L>Dispelling the low mists of doubtful light,</L>
<L>Its lustre on some hideous object throws,</L>
<L>And all its hateful horror clearly shows—</L>
<L>If Genius could in Mercy's cause prevail,</L>
<L>When Interest presses the opposing scale,</L>
<L>How swift had BRITONS torn your galling chain,</L>
<L>And from their country wip'd its foulest stain!—</L>
<L>But oh, since mis'ry, in its last excess,</L>
<L>In vain from BRITISH honour hopes redress;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
May other Lands the bright example show,</L>
<L>May other regions lessen human woe!</L>
<L>Yes, GALLIA, haste! tho' BRITAIN's sons decline</L>
<L>The glorious power to save, that power is thine;</L>
<L>Haste! since, while BRITAIN courts that dear-bought gold,</L>
<L>For which her virtue and her fame are sold,</L>
<L>And calmly calculates her trade of death,</L>
<L>Her groaning victims yield in pangs their breath;</L>
<L>Then save some portion of that suff'ring race</L>
<L>From ills the mind can scarce endure to trace!</L>
<L>Oh! whilst with mien august thy Leaders scan,</L>
<L>And guard with jealous zeal the rights of man,</L>
<L>Forget not that to all kind Nature gives</L>
<L>Those common rights, the claim of all that lives.—</L>
<L>But yet my filial heart its wish must breathe</L>
<L>That BRITAIN first may snatch this deathless wreath;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
First to the earth this act divine proclaim,</L>
<L>And wear the freshest palm of virtuous fame;</L>
<L>May I, in foreign realms, her glories hear,</L>
<L>Catch the lov'd sounds, and pour th' exulting tear!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when, the destin'd hour of exile past,</L>
<L>My willing feet shall reach their home at last;</L>
<L>When, with the trembling hope Affection proves,</L>
<L>My eager heart shall search for those it loves,</L>
<L>May no sharp pang that cherish'd hope destroy,</L>
<L>And from my bosom tear the promis'd joy;</L>
<L>Shroud every object, every scene in gloom,</L>
<L>And lead my bleeding soul to Friendship's tomb!</L>
<L>But may that moment to my eyes restore</L>
<L>The friends whose love endears my native shore!</L>
<L>Ah! long may Friendship, like the western ray,</L>
<L>Chear the sad evening of a stormy day;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
And gild my shadowy path with ling'ring light,</L>
<L>The last dear beam that slowly sinks in night.</L>
