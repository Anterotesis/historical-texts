<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is so customary to write
Prefaces to all Books of
this Kind to introduce them
with the more Advantage into
the World, that I cannot omit it,
tho' on that Account, 'tis thought, this
Work needs a <HI>Preface</HI> less than any
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
that ever went before it; the pleasant
and delightful Part speaks for it self;
the useful and instructive Part is so
large, and capable of so many Improve∣ments,
that it would imploy a Book,
large as it self, to make Improve∣ments
suitable to the vast Variety of
the Subject.</P>
<P>Here's Room for just and copious Ob∣servations,
on the Blessing, and Ad∣vantages
of a sober and well govern'd
Education, and the Ruin of so many
Thousands of Youths of all Kinds, in
this Nation, for want of it; also
how much publick Schools, and Charities
might be improv'd to prevent the De∣struction
of so many unhappy Children,
as, in this Town, are every Year Bred
up for the Gallows.</P>
<P>The miserable Condition of unhap∣py
Children, many of whose natural
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Tempers are docible, and would lead
them to learn the best Things rather than
the worst, is truly deplorable, and is
abundantly seen in the History of this
Man's Childhood; where, though Cir∣cumstances
form'd him by Necessity to
be a Thief, a strange Rectitude of
Principles remain'd with him, and
made him early abhor the worst Part of
his Trade, and at last wholly leave it
off: If he had come into the World with
the Advantage of Education, and been
well instructed how to improve the
generous Principles he had in him,
what a Man might he not have
been.</P>
<P>The various Turns of his Fortunes
in the World, make a delightful Field
for the Reader to wander in; a Garden
where he may gather wholesome and
medicinal Plants, none noxcious or
poisonous; where he will see Virtue
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
and the Ways of Wisdom, every where
applauded, honoured, encouraged, re∣warded;
Vice and all Kinds of Wick∣edness
attended with Misery, many
Kinds of Infelicities, and at last, Sin
and Shame going together, the Per∣sons
meeting with Reproof and Re∣proach,
and the Crimes with Abhor∣rence.</P>
<P>Every wicked Reader will here be
encouraged to a Change, and it will
appear that the best and only good
End of a wicked mispent Life is Re∣pentance;
that in this, there is Comfort,
Peace, and often times Hope, and that
the Penitent shall be return'd like the
Prodigal, <HI>and his latter End be better
than his Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>While these Things, and such as
these, are the Ends and Designs of the
whole Book, <HI>I think,</HI> I need not say
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
one Word more as an Apology for any
part of the rest, no, nor for the
whole; if Discouraging every thing that
is Evil, and encouraging every thing
that is vertuous and good; <HI>I say,</HI> If
these appear to be the whole Scope and
Design of the Publishing this Story,
no Objection can lye against it, neither
is it of the least Moment to enquire
whether the Colonel hath told his own
Story true or not; If he has made it a
<HI>History</HI> or a <HI>Parable,</HI> it will be
equally useful, and capable of doing
Good; and in that it recommends it
self without any other <HI>Introduction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
Col. JACK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>EEING my Life has been such a
Checquer Work of Nature, and that
I am able now to look back upon
it from a safer Distance, than is ordi∣narily
the Fate of the Clan to which
I once belong'd; I think my History may find
a place in the World, as well as some, who I see
are every Day read with pleasure, tho' they have
in them nothing so Diverting, or Instructing, as I
believe mine will appear to be.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
MY original may be as high as any Bodies for
ought I know, for my Mother kept very good Com∣pany,
but that part belongs to her Story, more than
to mine; all I know of it, is by oral Tradition
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us; my Nurse told me my Mother was a Gentle∣woman,
that my Father was a Man of Quality,
and she (my Nurse) had a good peice of Money
given her to take me off his Hands, and deliver
him and my Mother from the Importunities that
usually attend the Misfortune, of having a Child
to keep that should not be seen or heard of.</P>
<P>MY Father it seems gave my Nurse something
more than was agreed for at my Mother's request,
upon her solemn Promise that she would use me
well, and let me be put to School, and charg'd her
that if I liv'd to come to any bigness, capable to
understand the meaning of it, she should always
take care to bid me <HI>remember, that I was a Gentle∣man,</HI>
and this he said was all the Education he
would desire of her for me, for he did not doubt,
he said, but that sometime or other the very hint
would inspire me with Thoughts suitable to my
Birth, and that I would certainly act like a Gen∣leman,
if I believed myself to be so.</P>
<P>BUT my Dissasters were not directed to end as
soon as they began; 'tis very seldom that the Un∣fortunate
are so but for a Day, as the Great rise by
degrees of Greatness to the Pitch of Glory, in
which they shine, so the Miserable sink to the
depth of their Misery by a continu'd Series of
Dissaster, and are long in the Tortures and Ago∣nies
of their distress'd Circumstances before a
Turn of Fortune, if ever such a thing happens to
them, gives them a prospect of Deliverance.</P>
<P>MY Nurse was as honest to the Engagement
she had enter'd into, as cou'd be expected from
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
one of her Employment, and particularly as
honest as her Circumstances would give her leave
to be; for she Bred me up very carefully with
her own Son, and with another Son of shame <HI>like
me,</HI> who she had taken upon the same Terms.</P>
<P>MY Name was <HI>John,</HI> as she told me, but nei∣ther
she or I, knew any thing of a Sir-name that
belong'd to me; so I was left to call myself Mr.
Any-thing, what I pleas'd, as Fortune and better
Circumstances should give occasion.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that▪ her own Son (<HI>for she had a
little Boy of her own, about One Year older than I</HI>)
was call'd <HI>John</HI> too, and about two Year after she
took another, <HI>Son of Shame,</HI> as I call'd it above,
to keep as she did me, and his Name was <HI>John</HI>
too.</P>
<P>As we were all <HI>Johns,</HI> we were all <HI>Jacks,</HI> and soon
came to be call'd so, for at that Part of the Town,
where we had our Breeding, <HI>viz.</HI> near <HI>Goodma's-fields,</HI>
the <HI>Johns</HI> are generally call'd <HI>Jack;</HI> but my
Nurse, who may be allow'd to distinguish her own
Son a little from the rest, would have him call'd
Captain, because forsooth he was the eldest.</P>
<P>I WAS provok'd at having this Boy call'd Cap∣tain,
and I cried and told my Nurse I would be call'd
Captain, for she told me I was a Gentleman,
and I would be a Captain, that I would: The
good Woman to keep the Peace, told me ay, ay,
I was a Gentleman, and therefore I should be a∣bove
a Captain, for I should be a Colonel, and that
was a great deal better than a Captain; for my
Dear, <HI>says she,</HI> every Tarpawlin if he gets but to
be Lieutenant of a Press-Smack is call'd Captain,
but Colonels are Soldiers, and none but Gentle∣men
are ever made Colonels; besides, <HI>says she,</HI> I
have known Colonels come to be Lords, and Ge∣nerals,
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
tho' they were Bas—ds at first, and there∣fore
you shall be call'd Colonel.</P>
<P>WELL, I was hush'd indeed with this for the
present, but not thoroughly pleas'd, till a little
while after I heard her tell her own Boy, that I
was a Gentleman, and therefore he must call me
Colonel, at which her Boy fell a crying, and he
would be call'd Colonel; that Part pleas'd me to the
Life, that he should cry to be call'd Colonel, for
then I was satisfy'd that it was above a Captain:
So universally is Ambition seated in the Minds of
Men, that not a Beggar-boy but has his share
of it.</P>
<P>So here was Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI> and Captain <HI>Jack,</HI> as
for the third Boy, he was only plain <HI>Jack</HI> for
some Years after, till he came to Preferment by
the Merit of his Birth, as you shall hear in its
Place.</P>
<P>WE were hopeful Boy's all Three of us, and
promis'd very early by many repeated Circum∣stances
of our Lives, that we would be all Rogues,
and yet I cannot say, if what I have heard of my
Nurses Character be true, but the honest Woman
did what she cou'd to prevent it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I tell you much more of our Story, it
would be very proper to give you something of
our several Characters, as I have gather'd them up
in my Memory, as far back as I can recover
things, either of myself▪ or my Brother <HI>Jacks,</HI>
and they shall be Brief and Impartial.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> JACK, was the eldest of us all, by a whole
Year, he was a squat, big, strong made Boy, and
promis'd to be stout when grown up to be a
Man, but not to be tall. His Temper was sly,
sullen, reserv'd, malicious, revengeful; and with∣al,
he was brutish, bloody, and cruel in his Dispo∣sition;
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
he was as to manners a meer Boor, or Clown,
of a Carman like Breed; sharp as a Street bred
Boy must be, but ignorant and unteachable from
a Child. He had much the Nature of a Bull Dog,
bold and desperate, but not generous at all; all
the School-Mistresses we went to, could never
make him learn, no, not so much as to make him
know his Letters; and as if he was born a Thief,
he would steal every thing that came near him,
even as soon almost as he could Speak; and that,
not from his Mother only, but from any Body
else, and from us too that were his Brethren and
Companions. He was an original Rogue, for he
would do the foulest and most villainous Things,
even by his own Inclination; he had no Taste or
Sense of being Honest, no, not, I say, to his
Brother Rogues; which is what other Thieves
make a point of Honour of; I mean that of being
Honest to one another.</P>
<P>THE other, that is to say, the youngest of us
<HI>Johns,</HI> was called Major <HI>Jack,</HI> by the Accident
following; the Lady that had deposited him with
our Nurse, had own'd to her that it was a Major
of the Guards that was the Father of the Child;
but that she was obliged to conceal his Name, and
that was enough. So he was at first call'd <HI>John</HI>
the <HI>Major,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Major,</HI> and at last,
when we came to rove together, Major <HI>Jack,</HI> ac∣cording
to the rest, for his Name was <HI>John,</HI> as I
have observ'd already.</P>
<P><HI>Major</HI> JACK was a merry, facetions pleasant
Boy, had a good share of Wit, especially <HI>Off-hand-Wit,</HI>
as they call it; was full of Jests and good
Humour, and as I often said, had some thing of
a Gentleman in him; he had a true Manly
Courage, fear'd nothing, and could look Death
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
in the Face, without any Hesitation; and yet if
he had the Advantage, was the most generous and
most compassionate Creature alive; he had
native Principles of Gallantry in him, without
any thing of the brutal or terrible Part that the
Captain had; and in a Word, he wanted nothing but
Honesty to have made him an excellent Man; he
Had learned to read as I had done, and as he talk'd
very well, so he wrote good Sense, and very hand∣some
Language, as you will see in the process of
his Story.</P>
<P>As for your humble Servant, Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI>
he was a poor unhappy tractable Dog, willing
enough, and capable too, to learn any thing, if
he had had any but the Devil for his School-Ma∣ster:
He set out into the World so early, that
when he began to do Evil, he understood nothing
of the Wickedness of it, nor what he had to ex∣pect
for it: I remember very well, that when I
was once carried before a Justice, for a Theft
which indeed I was not guilty of, and defended
my self by Argument, proving the Mistakes of
my Accusers, and how they contradicted them∣selves;
the Justice told me it was pitty I had not
been better employ'd, for I was certainly better
taught; in which however his Worship was mista∣ken,
for I had never been taught any thing, but
to be a Thief; except, as I said, to read, and
write, and that was all, before I was ten Years
old: But I had a natural Talent of Talking, and
could say as much to the Purpose as most People
that had been taught no more than I.</P>
<P>I pass'd among my Comrades for a bold reso∣lute
Boy, and one that durst fight any thing;
but I had a different Opinion of my self, and
therefore shun'd Fighting as much as I could,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
tho' sometimes, I ventur'd too, and came off well,
being very strong made, and nimble withal.
However, I many times brought my self off with
my Tongue, where my Hands would not have been
sufficient; and this as well after I was a Man, as
while I was a Boy.</P>
<P>I was Wary and Dextrous at my Trade, and was
not so often catch'd as my Fellow Rogues, I mean
while I was a Boy, and never, after I came to
be a Man, no, not once for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>26 Years, being so
old in the Trade, and still unhang'd as you
shall hear.</P>
<P>AS for my Person, while I was a dirty Glass-Bottle
House Boy, sleeping in the Ashes, and deal∣ing
always in the Street Dirt, it cannot be expect∣ed
but that I look'd like what I was, and so we did
all; that is to say, like a <HI>Black your Shoes your
Honour,</HI> a Beggar Boy, a Black-Guard Boy, or
what you please, despicable, and miserable, to
the last Degree; and yet I remember, the Peo∣ple
would say of me, that Boy has a good Face;
if he was wash'd, and well dress'd, he would be
a good pretty Boy, do but look what Eyes he has,
what a pleasant smiling Countenance, 'tis Pitty!
I wonder what the Rogues Father and Mother was,
and the like; then they would call me, and ask
me my Name; and I would tell them my Name
was <HI>Jack.</HI> But what's your Sir Name, Sirrah? says
they: I don't know says I: Who is your Father
and Mother? I have none, said I. What, and
never had you any? said they: No, says I, not
that I know of: Then they would shake their
Heads, and cry, poor Boy! and 'tis a Pitty! <HI>and
the like!</HI> and so let me go. But I say'd up all
these things in my Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
I WAS almost 10 Year old, the Captain 11,
and the Major about 8, when the good Woman
my Nurse died; her Husband was a Seaman, and
had been drown'd a little before in the <HI>Gloucester</HI>
Frigat. one of the King's Ships which was Cast
away going to <HI>Scotland</HI> with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the honest
Woman dying very Poor, the Parish was oblig'd
to bury her; when the three young <HI>Jacks</HI> at∣tended
her Corps, and I the Colonel, for we all
pass'd for her own Children, was Chief Mourner,
the Captain who was the eldest Son, going back
very sick.</P>
<P>THE good Woman being dead, we, the three
<HI>Jacks,</HI> were turn'd loose to the World; as to the
Parish providing for us, we did not trouble our
selves much about that; we rambl'd about all three
together, and the People in <HI>Rosemary-Lane,</HI> and
<HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and that Way knowing us pretty well,
we got Victuals easily enough, and without much
B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gging.</P>
<P>FOR my particular Part, I got some Reputation,
for a mighty civil honest Boy; for if I was sent
of an Errand, I always did it punctually and
carefully, and made haste again; and if I was
trusted with any thing, I never touch'd it to di∣minish
it, but made it a Point of Honour to be
punctual to whatever was committed to me, tho' I
was as Errant a Thief as any of them in all other
Cases.</P>
<P>IN like Case, some of the poorer Shop-Keep∣ers,
would often leave me at their Door, to look
after their Shops, 'till they went up to Dinner,
or 'till they went over the Way to an Ale-House,
and the like, and I always did it freely and chear∣fully,
and with the utmost Honesty.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<HI>Capt.</HI> JACK on the contrary, a surly, ill-look'd,
rough Boy, had not a Word in his Mouth that savour∣ed
either of good Manners, or good Humour; he
wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d say yes, and no, just as he was ask'd a Question,
and that was all, but no Body got any thing from
him that was obliging in the least; if he was sent
of an Errand he would forget half of it, and it may
be go to play, if he met any Boys, and never go
at all, or if he went never come back with an An∣swer;
which was such a regardless, disobliging
Way, that no Body, had a good Word for him,
and every Body said he had the very look of a
Rogue, and would come to be Hang'd: In a
Word he got nothing of any Body for good will,
but was as it were oblig'd to turn Thief, for the
meer Necessity of Bread to eat; for if he beg'd,
he did it with so ill a Tone, rather like bidding
Folks give him Victuals, than entreating them,
that one Man of whom he had something given,
and knew him, told him one Day, Capt. <HI>Jack,
says he,</HI> thou art but an awkward, ugly sort of a
Beggar now thou art a Boy, I doubt thou wilt be
fitter to ask a Man for his Purse, than for a Penny,
when thou comest to be a Man.</P>
<P>THE Major was a merry Thoughtless Fellow,
always Chearful, whether he had any Victuals
or no, he never complain'd, and he recommended
himself so well by his good Carriage that the
Neighbours lov'd him, and he got Victuals enough
one where or other: Thus we all made a shift, tho'
we were so little to keep from starving, and as for
Lodging, we lay in the Summer-time about the
Watch-houses, and on Bulk-heads, and Shop∣doors,
where we were known; as for a Bed we knew
nothing what belong'd to it for many Years af∣ter
my Nurse died, and in Winter we got into the
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Ash-holes, and Nealing-Arches in the Glass-house,
call'd <HI>Dallows</HI>'s Glass-house, near <HI>Rosemary-Lane,</HI>
or at another Glass-house in <HI>Ratcliff-high-way.</HI></P>
<P>IN this manner we liv'd for some Years, and
here we fail'd not to fall among a Gang of naked,
ragged Rogues like ourselves, wicked as the De∣vil
cou'd desire to have them be, at so early an
Age, and Ripe for all the other Parts of Michief
that suited them as they advanc'd in Years.</P>
<P>I remember that one cold Winter Night we
were disturb'd in our Rest with a Constable, and
his Watch, crying out for one <HI>Wry-Neck,</HI> who it
seems had done some Roguery, and requir'd a Hue
and Cry of that Kind, and the Watch were in∣form'd
he was to be found among the Beggar-boys
under the Nealing-Arches in the Glass-house.</P>
<P>THE alarm being given, we were awaken'd in
the Dead of the Night with <HI>come out here,</HI> ye Crew
of young Devils, come out and show yourselves;
so we were all produc'd, some came out rubbing
their Eyes, and scratching their Heads, and o∣thers
were dragg'd out, and I think there was a∣bout
Seventeen of us in all, but <HI>Wry-Neck,</HI> as
they call'd him, was not among them; it seems
this was a good big Boy that us'd to be among the
Inhabitants of that Place, and had been concern'd in
a Robbery the Night before, in which his Comrade
who was taken, who in hopes of escaping Punish∣ment
had discover'd him and inform'd where he
usually Harbour'd; but he was aware it seems,
and had secur'd himself, at least for that time; so
we were allow'd to return to our warm Appart∣ment
among the Coal-ashes, where I slept many
a cold Winter Night: Nay, I may say, many a
Winter, as sound, and as comfortably as ever I
did since, tho' in better Lodging.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
IN this manner of living, we went on a good
while, I believe two Year, and neither did, or
meant any Harm: We generally went all Three
together; for in short, the Captain for want of
Address, and for something disagreeable in him,
would have starv'd if we had not kept him with
us: As we were always together, we were gene∣rally
known by the Name of the three <HI>Jacks;</HI> but
Col. <HI>Jack</HI> had always the preference upon many
Accounts; the Major, as I have said, was Merry
and Pleasant, but the Colonel always held talk
with the better Sort; I mean, the better Sort of
those that would Converse with a Beggar-boy: In
this way of Talk, I was always upon the Inquiry,
asking Questions of things done in Publick as well
as in Private, particularly, I lov'd to talk with
Seamen and Soldiers about the War, and about
the great Sea-Fights, or Battles on Shore, that
any of them had been in; and as I never forgot any
thing they told me, I could soon, that is to say, in
a few Years give almost as good an Account of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> War, and of the Fights at Sea, the Battles
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the taking of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and the like,
as any of those that had been there, and this
made those old Soldiers and Tars love to talk with
me too, and to tell me all the Stories they could
think of, and that not only of the Wars then go∣ing
on, but also of the Wars in <HI>Oliver's</HI> time, the
Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, and the like.</P>
<P>BY this means, as young as I was, I was
a kind of an Historian, and tho' I had read
no Books, and never had any Books to read,
yet I cou'd give a tollerable Account of what
had been done, and of what was then a do∣ing
in the World, especially in those things
that our own People were concern'd in. I
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
knew the Names of every Ship in the Navy, and
who commanded them too, and all this before I
was 14 Year old, or but very soon after.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> JACK, in this time fell into bad Compa∣ny,
and went away from us, and it was a good
while before we ever heard Tale or Tidings of him,
till about half Year, I think or there abouts, I un∣derstood
he was got among a Gang of Kidnappers
as they were then call'd, being a Sort of wicked
Fellows that us'd to Spirit Peoples Children away
that is snatch them up in the Dark, and stop∣ing
their Mouths, carry them to such House<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
where they had Rogues, ready to receive them
and so carry them on Board Ships bound to <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI>
and sell them.</P>
<P>THIS was a Trade that horrid <HI>Jack,</HI> for so I call'd
him, when we were grown up, was very fit for
especially the violent Part; for if a little Child
got into his Clutches he would stop the Breath of
it, instead of stopping its Mouth, and never
Trouble his Head with the Childs being almost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
strangl'd, so he did but keep it from making <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Noise. There was it seems some Villainous thing
done by this Gang about that time, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Child was murther'd among them, or a Child o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
therwise abus'd; but it seems it was a Child of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣eminent
Citizen, and the Parent some how or other
got a Scent of the thing, so that they recover'd
their Child, tho' in a sad Condition, and almost
kill'd; I was too young, and it was too long ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
for me to remember the whole Story, but they
were all taken up, and sent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<HI>Jack</HI> among the rest, tho' he was but young, for
he was not then much above 13 Year old.</P>
<P>WHAT punishment was inflicted upon the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
gues of that Gang I cannot tell now, but the
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
Captain being but a lad, was order'd to be three
times soundly Whipt at <HI>Bridewell;</HI> my Lord Mayor,
or the Recorder telling him, it was done in pitty
to him, to keep him from the Gallows, not forget∣ting
to tell him that he had a Hanging look, and
bid him have a care on that very Account; so re∣markable
was the Captain's Countenance, even
so young, and which he heard of afterwards on
many Occasions: When he was in <HI>Bridewell,</HI> I
heard of his Misfortune, and the Major and I
went to see him, for this was the first News we
heard of what became of him.</P>
<P>THE very Day that we went, he was call'd out
to be Corrected, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> according to his
Sentence, and as it was order'd to be done sound∣ly,
so indeed they were true to the Sentence, for
the Alderman, who was the President of <HI>Bridewell,</HI>
and who I think they call'd Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI>
held preaching to him about how young he was,
and what pitty it was such a Youth should come
to be hang'd, and a great deal more, how he should
take warning by it, and how wicked a thing it
was that they should steal away poor innocent
Children, and the like; and all this while the
Man with a blue Badge on, lash'd him most un∣mercifully,
for he was not to leave off till Sir
<HI>William</HI> knock'd with a little Hammer on the
Table.</P>
<P>THE poor Captain stamp'd, and danc'd, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roar'd out like a mad Boy; and I must confess, I
was frighted almost to Death; for tho' I could
not come near enough, being but a poor Boy, to
see how he was handled, yet I saw him after∣wards,
with his Back all wheal'd with the Lashes,
and in several Places bloody, and thought I
should have died with the Sight of it; but I
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
grew better acquainted with those Things after∣wards.</P>
<P>I DID what I could to comfort the poor
Captain, when I got Leave to come to him.
But the worst was not over with him, for he
was to have two more such Whippings be∣fore
they had done with him; and indeed they
scourg'd him so severely, that they made him Sick
of the Kidnapping Trade for a great while; but
he fell in among them again, and kept among
them as long as that Trade lasted, for it ceased in
a few Years afterwards.</P>
<P>THE Major, and I, tho' very Young, had sensi∣ble
Impressions made upon us, for some time, by
the severe Usage of the Captain, and it might be
very well said we were corrected as well as he,
tho' not concerned in the Crime: But it was
within the Year, that the Major, a good Condi∣tion'd
easy Boy, was wheedled a way, by a
couple of young Rogues that frequented the
Glass-house Appartments, to take a Walk with
them, as they were pleased to call it: The Gen∣tlemen
were very well match'd, the Major was
about 12 Year old, and the oldest of the Two that
led him out, was not above fourteen; the busi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ness
was to go to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, and the End
of going to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, was in short, to
pick Pockets.</P>
<P>THE Major knew nothing of the Trade, and
therefore was to do nothing, but they promised
him a Share with them for all that, as if he had
been as expert as themselves; so away they
went. The two dexterous young Rogues manag'd
it so well, that by about 8 a Clock at Night, they
came back to our dusty Quarters at the Glass-House,
and sitting them down in a Corner, they
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
began to share their Spoil, by the Light of the
Glass-House Fire: The Major lug'd out the
Goods, for as fast as they any Purchase,
they unloaded themselves and gave all to him,
that if they had been taken, nothing might be
found about them.</P>
<P>IT was a devilish lucky Day to them, the Devil
certainly assisting them to find their Prey, that
he might draw in a young Gamester, and encou∣rage
him to the Undertaking, who had been made
backward before, by the Misfortune of the Cap∣tain.
The List of their Purchase the first Night,
was as follows.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. A white Handkerchief from a Country
Wench, as she was staring up at a <HI>Jackpud∣ding,</HI>
there was 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and a Row of Pins,
tyed up in one End of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. A colour'd Handkerchief, out of a young
Country Fellow's Pocket as he was buying a
<HI>China</HI> Orange.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A Ribband Purse with 11 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> and a
Silver Thimble in it, out of a young Wo∣man's
Pocket, just as a Fellow offer'd to pick
her up.
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> She mist her Purse presently, but
not seeing the Thief, charg'd the Man
with it, that would have pick'd her up,
and cry'd out a Pick-Pocket, and he
fell into the Hands of the Mobb, but
being known in the Street, he got off
with great Difficulty.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. A Knife and Fork, that a Couple of Boys
had just bought, and were going Home with;
the young Rogue that took it, got it within
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
the Minute after the Boy had put it in his
Pocket.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. A little Silver Box, with seven Shillings
in it, all in small Silver, 1 <HI>d. 2 d. 3 d. 4 d.</HI>
Peices.
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> This, it seems a Maid pull'd out
of her Pocket, to pay at her going into
the Booth to see a Show, and the little
Rogue got his Hand in and fetch'd it
off, just as she put it up again.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Another Silk Handkerchief, out of a Gen∣tleman's
Pocket.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. A Joynted Baby, and a little Looking
Glass stolen off a Toy Seller's Stall, in the
Fair.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>ALL this Cargo to be brought Home clear in
one Afternoon, or Evening rather, and by only
two little Rogues, so young, was it must be con∣fess'd,
Extraordinary; and the Major was elevated
the next Day to a strange Degree.</P>
<P>HE came very early to me, who lay not far
from him, and said to me Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI> I want
to speak with you. Well, said I, what do you
say? Nay, said he, it is Business of Consequence,
I cannot talk here, so we walk'd out: As soon as
we were come out into a narrow Lane, by the
Glass-House, look here, says he, and pulls out
his little Hand almost full of Money.</P>
<P>I WAS surpriz'd at the Sight, when he puts it
up again, and bringing his Hand out, here says he,
you shall have some of it, and gives me a Six-pence,
and a Shillings worth of the small Silver
Peices. This was very welcome to me, who, as
much as I was of a Gentleman, and as much as I
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
thought of myself upon that Account, never had
a Shilling of Money together before, in all my
Life, not that I could call my own.</P>
<P>I WAS very earnest then to know how he came
by this Wealth, for he had for his Share 7<HI>s.</HI> and
6<HI>d.</HI> in Money, the silver Thimble and a silk
Handkercher, which was in short an Estate to
him, that never had, as I said of myself a Shil∣ling
together in his Life.</P>
<P>AND what will you do with it now <HI>Jack</HI> said
I? I do, <HI>says be,</HI> the first thing I do, I'll go into
Rag-Fair, and buy me a pair of Shoes and Stock∣ings,
that's right, <HI>says I,</HI> and so will I too; so a∣way
we went together, and we bought each of us
a pair of Rag-Fair Stockings in the first Place for
5<HI>d.</HI> not 5<HI>d.</HI> a Pair, but 5<HI>d.</HI> together, and good
Stockings they were too, much above our wear I
assure you.</P>
<P>WE found it more difficult to fit our selves with
Shoes, but at last, having look'd a great while
before we co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d find any good enough for us, we
found a Shop very well stor'd, and of these we
bought two Pair for Sixteen-pence.</P>
<P>WE put them on immediately to our great
Comfort, for we had neither of us had any Stock∣ings
to our Legs that had any Feet to them for
a long time: I found myself so refresh'd with
having a Pair of warm Stockings on, and a Pair
of dry Shoes; things, I say, which I had not been
acquainted with a great while, that I began to
call to mind my being a Gentleman, and now I
thought it began to come to pass; when we had
thus fitted ourselves, I said, hark ye Major <HI>Jack,</HI>
you and I, never had any Money in our Lives
before, and we never had a good Dinner in all
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
our Lives; What if we should go somewhere and
get some Victuals, I am very hungry?</P>
<P>So, we will then says the Major, I am a hun∣gry
too; so we went to a boiling Cook's in <HI>Rose∣mary-Lane,</HI>
where we treated our selves Nobly,
and as I thought with my self we began to live
like Gentlemen, for we had Three-penny-worth
of boil'd Beef, Two-penny-worth of Pudding,
a pennv Brick, (as they call it, or Loaf) and a
whole Pint of strong Beer, which was seven Pence
in all.</P>
<Q><P><HI>N. B.</HI> WE had each of us a good mess of charm∣ing
Beef Broth into the Bargain; and which
chear'd my Heart wonderfully, all the while
we were at Dinner, the Maid and the Boy in
the House every time they pass'd by the open
Box where we sat at our Dinner, would look
in, and cry, Gentlemen Do ye call? and do
ye call Gentlemen? I say this was as good
to me as all my Dinner.</P></Q>
<P>NOT the best House-keeper in <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish,
not my Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> no, not the great∣est
Man on Earth could be more happy in their
own Imagination, and with less mixture of Grief,
or Reflexion, than I was at this new Peice of Felici∣ty,
tho' mine was but a small Part of it, for Major
<HI>Jack</HI> had an Estate compar'd to me, as I had an E∣state
compar'd to what I had before: In a Word,
nothing but an utter Ignorance of greater Feli∣city,
which was my Case, could make any Body
think himself so exalted as I did, tho' I had no
share of this Booty but Eighteen-pence.</P>
<P>THAT Night the Major and I triumph'd in our
new Enjoyment, and slept with an undisturb'd
Repose in the usual Place, surrounded with the
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
warmth of the Glass-house Fires above, which
was a full amends for all the Ashes and Cinders
which we roll'd in below.</P>
<P>THOSE who know the Position of the Glass∣houses,
and the Arches where they Neal the Bot∣tles
after they are made, know that those Places
where the Ashes are Cast, and where the poor Boys
lye, are Caveties in the Brick-work, perfectly
close, except at the Entrance, and consequently
warm as the Dressing-room of a <HI>Bagnio;</HI> that it is
impossible they can feel any Cold there, were it
in <HI>Greenland,</HI> or <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and that therefore
the Boys lye not only safe, but very comforta∣bly,
the Ashes excepted, which are no Grievance
at all to them.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Major and his Comrades
went abroad again, and were still Successful; nor
did any Disaster attend them, for I know not
how many Months, and by frequent imitation and
direction, Major <HI>Jack</HI> became as dexterous a Pick∣pocket
as any of them, and went on thro' a long
variety of Fortunes, too long to enter upon now,
because I am hastening to my own Story, which at
present is the main thing I have to set down.</P>
<P>THE Major fail'd not to let me see every Day
the Effects of his new Prosperity, and was so
bountiful, as frequently to throw me a Tester,
sometimes a Shilling; and I might perceive that
he began to have Cloths on his Back to leave the
Ash-hole, having gotten a Society Lodging (of
which I may give an Explanation by itself on
another Occasion) and which was more, he took
upon him to wear a Shirt, which was what nei∣ther
he, or I had ventur'd to do for three Year
before and upward.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26"/>
BUT I observ'd all this while, that tho' Ma∣jor
<HI>Jack</HI> was so Prosperous and had thriven so
well, and notwithstanding he was very kind, and
even generous to me, in giving me Money upon
many Occasions, yet he never invited me to enter
myself into the Society, or to embark with him
whereby I might have been made as happy as he,
no, nor did he recommend the Employment to
me at all.</P>
<P>I WAS not very well pleas'd with his being
thus reserv'd to me; I had learn'd from him in Ge∣neral,
that the Business was Picking of Pockets,
and I fancy'd that tho' the Ingenuity of the Trade
consisted very much in slight of Hand, a good A∣dress,
and being very Nimble, yet that it was
not at all difficult to learn; and especially I
thought the Opportunities were so many, the
Country People that come to <HI>London,</HI> so foolish,
so gaping, and so engag'd in looking about them,
that it was a Trade with no great hazard annex'd
to it, and might be easily learn'd, if I did but
know in general the Manner of it, and how they
went about it.</P>
<P>THE subtile Devil never absent from his Busi∣ness,
but ready at all Occasions to encourage his
Servants, remov'd all these Difficulties, and
brought me into an Intimacy with one of the
most exquisite Divers, or Pick pockets in the
Town; and this our Intima<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y was of no less a Kind,
than that, as I had an Inclination to be as wicked
as any of them, he was for taking Care that I should
not be disappointed.</P>
<P>HE was above the little F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llows, who went a∣bout
stealing Trifles, and Baubles in <HI>Bartholo∣mew-Fair,</HI>
and run the Risque of being Mobb'd
for three or four Shillings<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his aim was at
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
higher things, even at no less than considerable
Sums of Money, and Bills for more.</P>
<P>HE solicited me earnestly to go and take a
Walk with him, as above, adding that after he had
shown me my Trade a little, he would let me be
as wicked as I would, that is, as he express'd it, that
after he had made me capable, I should set up for
myself if I pleas'd, and he would only wish me
good Luck.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY as Major <HI>Jack</HI> went with his
Gentleman, only to see the manner, and receive
the Purchase, and yet come in for a Share; so he
told me if he had Success, I should have my Share
as much as if I had been Principal; and this he
assured me was a Custom of the Trade, in order
to encourage young Beginners, and bring them
into the Trade with Courage, for that nothing was
to be done if a Man had not the Heart of the Lyon.</P>
<P>I hesistated at the matter a great while, ob∣jecting
the Hazard, and telling the Story of Cap∣tain
<HI>Jack</HI> my elder Brother, as I might call
him: Well, Colonel, says he, I find you are
faint Hearted, and to be faint Hearted, is
indeed to be unfit for our Trade, for nothing
but a bold Heart can go Thro'-Stitch with this
Work; but however, as there is nothing for you
to do, so there is nothing for you to run, in
these things the first time, if I am taken says he,
you having nothing to do in it, they will let you
go free, for it shall easily be made appear that
whatever I have done, you had no Hand in it.</P>
<P>UPON those perswasions I ventur'd out with
him; but I soon found that my new Friend was
a Thief of Quality, and a Pick-pocket above the
ordinary Rank, and that aim'd higher abundant∣ly
than my Brother <HI>Jack;</HI> he was a bigger Boy
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
than I a great deal; for tho' I was now near 15
Year old, I was not big of my Age, and as to the
Nature of the thing, I was perfectly a Stranger to
it; I knew indeed what at first I did not, for it was
a good while before I understood the thing, as an
Offence: I look'd on picking Pockets as a kind of
Trade, and thought I was to go Apprentice to it;
tis true, this was when I was young in the Society,
as well as younger in Years, but even now I un∣derstood
it to be only a thing, for which if we were
catch'd, we run the Risque of being Duck'd or
Pump'd, which we call'd Soaking, and then all
was over; and we made nothing of having our
Raggs wetted a little; but I never understood,
till a great while after, that the Crime was Capi∣tal,
and that we might be sent to <HI>Newgate</HI> for it,
till a great Fellow, almost a Man, one of our
Society was hang'd for it, and then I was terribly
frighted, as you shall hear by and by.</P>
<P>WELL, upon the perswasions of this Lad, I
walk'd out with him; a poor innocent Boy, and
(as I remember, my very Thoughts perfectly well)
I had no Evil in my Intentions; I had never sto∣len
any thing in my Life, and if a Goldsmith
had left me in his Shop with heaps of Money,
strew'd all round me, and bad me look after it, I
should not have touch'd it, I was so honest; but
the subtile Tempter, baited his Hook for me, as I
was a Child, in a manner suited to my Childish∣ness,
for I never took this picking of Pockets to
be dishonesty, but as I have said above, I look'd
on it as a kind of Trade, that I was to be bred up to,
and so I enter'd upon it, till I became harden'd
in it beyond the Power of retreating; and thus I
was made a Thief involuntarily, and went on a
Length that few Boys do, without coming to
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
the common Period of that kind of Life, I mean
to the Transport Ship, or the Gallows.</P>
<P>THE first Day I went Abroad with my new
Instructor, he carried me directly into the City,
and as we went first to the Waterside, he led me
into the long Room at the Custom-house; we
were but a Couple of ragg'd Boys at best, but I was
much the worse, my Leader had a Hat on, a Shirt,
and a Neckcloth; as for me, I had neither of
the three, nor had I spoil'd my Manners so much
as to have a Hat on my Head since my Nurse died,
which was now some Years; his Orders to me
were to keep always in sight, and near him, but
not close to him, nor to take any notice of him
at any time till he came to me; and if any hurly
burly happen'd, I should by no means know him,
or pretend to have any thing to do with him.</P>
<P>IOBSERV'D my Orders to a tittle, while he
peer'd into every Corner, and had his Eye upon
every Body; I kept my Eye directly upon him,
but went always at a Distance, and on the other
Side of the long Room, looking as it were for
Pins, and picking them up on the Dust as I cou'd
find them, and then sticking them on my Sleeve,
where I had at last gotten 40 or 50 good Pins;
but still my Eye was upon my Comrade, who I
observ'd was very busy among the Crowds of
People that stood at the Board, doing business
with the Officers, who pass the Entries, and make
the Cocquets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AT length he comes over to me, and stooping
as if he would take up a Pin close to me, he put
something into my Hand and said, put that up,
and follow me down Stairs quickly; He did not
run, but shusfl'd along a pace thro' the Crowd, and
went down not the great Stairs, which we came in at,
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
but a little narrow Stair-Case at the other End of
the Long Room; I follow'd, and he found I did,
and so went on, not stopping below as I expected,
nor speaking one Word to me, till thro' innumera∣ble
narrow Passages, Alley's and Dark ways, we
were got up into <HI>Fenchurch-street,</HI> and thro' <HI>Billi∣ter
lane into Leadenball-street, and from thence into
Leadenball-Market.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not a Meat-Market Day so we had
room to sit down upon one of the Butcher's
Stalls, and he bad me Lug out; what he had given
me, was a little Leather Letter Case, with a <HI>French</HI>
Almanack stuck in the inside of it, and a great
many Papers in it of several kinds.</P>
<P>WE look'd them over, and found there was se∣veral
valuable Bills in it, such as Bills of <HI>Ex∣change,</HI>
and other Notes, things I did not under∣stand;
but among the rest was a Goldsmith's
Note, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> of one Sir <HI>Stephen Evens</HI> for
300 <HI>l.</HI> payable to the Bearer, and at Demand, be∣sides
this there was another Note, for 12<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI>
being a Goldsmith's Bill too, but I forget the
Name; there was a Bill or two also written in
<HI>French,</HI> which neither of us understood, but which
it seems were things of value, being call'd foreign
Bills accepted.</P>
<P>THE Rogue my Master knew what belong'd to
the Goldsmith's Bills well enough, and I observ'd
when he read the Bill of Sir <HI>Stephen;</HI> he said this
is too big for me to meddle with, but when he
came to the Bill, for 12 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> he said to me, <HI>this
will do, come hither</HI> Jack; so away he runs to <HI>Lom∣bard-street,</HI>
and I after him huddling the other Pa∣pers
into the Letter Case; as he went along, he en∣quir'd
the Name out immediately, and went di∣rectly
to the Shop, put on a good grave Counte∣nance,
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
and had the Money paid him without any
Stop or Question ask'd, I stood on the other side the
Way looking about the Street; as not at all con∣cern'd
with any Body that way, but observ'd that
when he presented the Bill he pull'd out the Let∣ter
Case, as if he had been a Merchant's Boy,
acquainted with Business, and had other Bills a∣bout
him.</P>
<P>THEY paid him the Money in Gold, and he
made hast enough in Telling it over, and came
away, passing by me, and going into <HI>Three-King-Court,</HI>
on the other Side of the way; then wes
cross'd back into <HI>Clements-Lane,</HI> made the best of
our way to <HI>Cole-Harbour,</HI> at the Water-side, and got
a Sculler for a Penny to carry us over the Water
to St. <HI>Mary Overs</HI> Stairs, where we Landed, and
were safe enough.</P>
<P>HERE he turns to me Col. <HI>Jack,</HI> says he, I be∣lieve
you are a lucky Boy, this is a good Jobb,
we'll go away to St. <HI>George's</HI> Fields, and Share
our Booty; away we went to the Fields, and sit∣ing
down in the Grass far enough out of the
Path, he pull'd out the Money, look here <HI>Jack,</HI>
says he, did you ever see the like before in
your Life? no, never says I, and added very inno∣cently,
<HI>must we have it all?</HI> we have it! lays he,
who should have it? Why says I, must the Man
have none of it again that lost it; he have
it again! says he, what d'ye mean by that; Nay,
I don't know, says I, why you said just now you
would let him have the tother Bill again, that
you said was too big for you.</P>
<P>HE Laught at me, you are but a little Boy
<HI>says he,</HI> that's true, but I thought you had not
been such a Child neither; so he mighty gravely
Explain'd the thing to me thus: That the Bill of
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
Sir <HI>Stephen Evans</HI> was a great Bill for 300<HI>l.</HI> and if
<HI>I, says be,</HI> that am but a poor Lad should venture
to go for the Money, they will presently say,
how should I come by such a Bill, and that I cer∣tainly
found it or stole it, so they will stop me
<HI>says he,</HI> and take it away from me, and it may be
bring me into Trouble for it too; so, <HI>says he,</HI> I
did say it was too big for me to meddle with, and
that I would let the Man have it again if I could
tell how; but for the Money <HI>Jack,</HI> the Money
that we have got, I warrant you he should have
none of that; besides <HI>says he,</HI> who ever he be that
has lost this Letter Case, to be sure, as soon as he
miss'd it, he would run to a <HI>Goldsmith</HI> and give
notice, that if any body came for the Money, they
should be stopp'd, but I am too Old for him there
<HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>WHY <HI>says I,</HI> and what will you do with the
Bill, Will you thro' it away? if you do, somebo∣dy
else will find it <HI>says I,</HI> and they will go and
take the Money: No, no, <HI>says he,</HI> then they will
be Stopp'd and Examin'd, as I tell you, I should
be: I did not know well what all this meant, so
I talk'd no more about that; but we fell to hand∣ling
the Money, as for me, I had never seen so
much together in all my Life, nor did I know
what in the World to do with it, and once or twice
I was a going to bid him keep it for me, which
wou'd have been done like a Child indeed, for to
be sure, I had never heard a word more of it, tho'
nothing had befallen him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I happen'd to hold my Tongue
as to that part, he shar'd the Money very honest∣ly
with me, only at the end he told me, that tho'
it was true, he promis'd me half, yet as it was the
first time, and I had done nothing but look on, so
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
he thought it was very well if I took a little
less than he did; so he divided the Money, which
was 12 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> into two exact Parts (<HI>viz.) 6 l. 5 s.</HI>
in each Part, then he took 1 <HI>l. 5 s.</HI> from my Part,
and told me I should give him that for Handsel,
Well, <HI>says I,</HI> take it then, for I think you
deserve it all; so however, I took up the rest, and
what shall I do with this now, <HI>says I,</HI> for I have
no where to put it? why have you no Pockets?
<HI>says he, yes says I,</HI> but they are full of Holes; I have
often thought since that, and with some Mirth
too, how I had really more Wealth than I knew
what to do with, for Lodging I had none, nor
any Box or Drawer to hide my Money in, nor
had I any Pocket, but such, <HI>as I say,</HI> was full of
Holes; I knew no Body in the World, that I
cou'd go and desire them to lay it up for me; for
being a poor nak'd, ragg'd Boy, they would pre∣sently
say, I had robb'd some Body, and perhaps
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay hold of me, and my Money would be my
Crime, <HI>as they say,</HI> it often is in foregin Coun∣tries
And now as I was full of Wealth, behold! I
was full of Care, for what to do to secure my Mo∣ney
I could not tell, and this held me so long,
and was so Vexatious to me the next Day, that I
truly sat down and cryed.</P>
<P>NOTHING cou'd be more perplexing than
this Money was to me all that Night, I car∣ried
it in my Hand a good while, for it was in
Gold all but 14 <HI>s.</HI> and that is to say, it was in four
Guineas, and that 14 <HI>s.</HI> was more difficult to carry
then the four Guineas; at last Isat down and pull'd
off one of my Shoes, and put the four Guineas into
that, but after I had gone a while, my Shoe hurt
me so, I could not go, so I was fain to sit down
again, and take it out of my Shoe, and car∣ry
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
it in my Hand, then I found a dirty Linnen
Rag in the Street, and I took that up, and wrapt
it all together, and carried it in that, a good way.
I have often since heard People, say when they have
been talking of Money, that they cou'd not get
in, I wish I had it in a foul Clout: In truth I had
mine in a <HI>foul Clout,</HI> for it was foul according to
the Letter of that saying, but it serv'd me till I
came to a convenient Place, and then I sat down
and wash'd the Cloth in the Kennel, and so
then put my Money in again.</P>
<P>WELL, I carried it home with me to my Lodg∣ing
in the Glass-house, and when I went to go to
Sleep, I, knew not what to do with it; if I had let
any of the black Crew I was with, know of it, I
should have been smother'd in the Ashes for it,
or robb'd of it, or some Trick or other put upon
me for it; or I knew not what to do, but lay with
it in my Hand, and my Hand in my Bosom, but
then Sleep went from Eyes: O! the weight of
Human Care! I a poor Beggar Boy could not
Sleep as soon as I had but a little Money to
keep, who before that, cou'd have slept upon a
heap of Brick-bats, or Stones, Cinders, or any
where, as found as a rich Man does on his down
Bed, and sounder too.</P>
<P>EVERY now and then dropping a sleep, I
should Dream that my Money was lost, and start
like one frighted; then finding it fast in my Hand,
try to go to sleep again, but could not for a long
while, then drop and start again; at last a Fancy
came into my Head, that if I fell a sleep, I should
Dream of the Money, and Talk of it in my
sleep, and tell that I had Money, which if I should
do, and one of the Rogues should hear me, they
would pick it out of my Bosom, and of my hand
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
too without waking me, and after that Thought
I could not sleep a wink more; so that I pass'd
that Night over in Care and Anxiety enough, and
this may safely say, was the first Nights rest that
I lost by the Cares of this Life, and the deceitful∣ness
of Riches.</P>
<P>As soon as it was Day, I got out of the Hole
we lay in, and rambled abroad into the Fields,
towards <HI>Stepney,</HI> and there I mus'd and consider'd
what I should do with this Money, and many a
time I wish'd that I had not had it, for after all
my ruminating upon it, and what Course I should
take with it, or where I should put it, I could
not hit upon any one thing, or any possible Method
to secure it, and it perplex'd me so, that at last,
as I said just now, I sat down and cryed heartily.</P>
<P>WHEN my crying was over, the Case was the
same; I had the Money still, and what to do with
it I could not tell, at last it came into my
Head, that I would look out for some Hole
in a Tree, and see to hide it there, till
I should have occasion for it: Big with this
discovery, as I then thought it, I began to look
about me for a Tree; but there were no Trees in
the Fields about <HI>Stepney,</HI> or <HI>Mile-End</HI> that look'd
fit for my purpose, and if there were any that I
began to look narrowly at, the Fields were so full
of People, that they would see if I went to hide any
thing there, and I thought the People Eyed me
as it was, and that two Men in particular follow'd
me, to see what I intended to do.</P>
<P>THIS drove me farther off, and I cross'd the
Road at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and in the middle of the
Town went down a Lane that goes away to the
<HI>Blind Beggars</HI> at <HI>Bedual-Green;</HI> when I came a lit∣tle
way in the Lane, I found a Foot-Path over
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
the Fields, and in those Fields several Trees for
my Turn, as I thought; at last one Tree had
a little Hole in it, pritty high out of my Reach,
and I climb'd up the Tree to get to it, and when
I came there, I put my Hand in, and found, (as
I thought) a Place very fit, so I placed my Trea∣sure
there, and was mighty well satisfy'd with it;
but behold, putting my Hand in again to lay it
more commodiously, as I thought, of a Suddain
it slipp'd away from me, and I found the Tree was
hollow, and my little Parcel was fallen in quite
out of my Reach, and how far it might go in, I
knew not; so, that in a Word, my Money was
quite gone, irrecoverably lost, there could be no
Room, so much as to Hope ever to see it again
for it was a vast great Tree.</P>
<P>As young as I was, I was now sensible what a
Fool I was before, that I could not think of Ways
to keep my Money, but I must come thus far to
throw it into a Hole where I could not reach it;
well, I thrust my Hand quite up to my Elbow,
but no Bottom was to be found, or any End of
the Hole or Cavity; I got a Stick off of the Tree
and thrust it in a great Way, but all was one;
then I cry'd, nay, I roar'd out, I was in such a
Passion, then I got down the Tree again, then up
again, and thrust in my Hand again till I scratch'd
my Arm and made it bleed, and cry'd all the
while most violently: Then I began to think I
had not so much as a half Penny of it left for a
half Penny Roll, and I was a hungry, and then I
cry'd again: Then I came away in dispair, cry∣ing,
and roaring like a little Boy that had been
whip'd, then I went back again to the Tree,
and up the Tree again, and thus I did several
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37"/>
THE last time I had gotten up the Tree, I
happen'd to come down not on the same Side that
I went up and came down before, but on the
other side of the Tree, and on the other Side of
the Bank also; and behold the Tree had a great
open Place in the Side of it close to the Ground,
as old hollow Trees often have; and looking into
the open Place, to my inexpressible Joy, there
lay my Money, and my Linnen Rag, all rap'd
up just as I had put it into the Hole: For the
Tree being hollow all the Way up, there had been
some Moss or light Stuff, which I had not
Judgement enough to know was not firm,
and had given way when it came to drop out of
my Hand, and so it had slip'd quite down at
once.</P>
<P>I WAS but a Child, and I rejoyced like a Child,
for I hollow'd quit out aloud, when I saw it; then
I run to it, and snatch'd it up, hug'd and kiss'd the
dirty Ragg a hundred Times; then danc'd and
jump'd about, run from on End of the Field to the
other, and in short, I knew not what, much less
do I know now what I did, tho' I shall never
forget the Thing, either what a sinking Grief it
was to my Heart when I thought I had lost it,
or what a Flood of Joy o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er whelm'd me when I
had got it again.</P>
<P>WHILE I was in the first Transport of my
Joy, as I have said, I run about and knew not
what I did; but when that was over, I sat down,
open'd the foul Clout the Money was in, look'd
at it, told it, found it was all there, and then I
fell a crying as savourly as I did before, when I
thought I had lost it.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38"/>
IT would tire the Reader should I dwell on all
the little Boyish Tricks that I play'd in the Exta∣cy
of my Joy, and Satisfaction, when I had found
my Money; so I break off here: Joy is as Ex∣travagant
as Grief, and since I have been a Man, I
have often thought, that had such a Thing befal∣len
a Man, so to have lost all he had, and not have
a bit of Bread to Eat, and then so strangely to
find it again, after having given it so effectually
over. <HI>I say,</HI> had it been so with a Man, it might
have hazarded, his using some Violence upon him∣self.</P>
<P>WELL,
I came away with my Money, and
having taken Six-pence out of it, before I made it
up again, I went to a Chandler's Shop in <HI>Mile∣End,</HI>
and bought a Half-Penny Roll, and a Half
Pennyworth of Cheese, and sat down at the Door
after I bought it, and eat it very heartily, and
begg'd some Beer to Drink with it, which the good
Woman gave me very freely.</P>
<P>AWAY I went then for the Town to see if I
could find any of my Companions, and resolv'd
I would try no more hollow Trees for my Trea∣sure;
as I came along <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> I came by
a Broker's Shop, over against the Church, where
they sold old Cloaths, for I had nothing on but
the worst of Rags; so I stopp'd at the Shop, and
stood looking at the Cloaths which hang'd at the
Door.</P>
<P>WELL, young Gentleman, says a Man that
stood at the Door, you look wishly, do you
see any thing you like, and will your Pocket
compass a good Coat now, for you look as if
you belong'd to the ragged Regiment: I was
affronted at the Fellow, what's that to you, <HI>said</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
I, how ragg'd I am, If I had seen any thing I lik'd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I have Money to pay for it; but I can go where
I shan't be Huffed at for looking.</P>
<P>WHILE I said thus, pretty boldly to the Fel∣low,
comes a Woman out, What a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l you, <HI>says she?</HI>
to the Man, to Bully away our Customers so; a
poor Boy's Money is as good as my Lord Mayors;
if poor People did not buy old Cloths, what would
become of our Business? and then turning to me,
come hither Child, <HI>says she,</HI> if thou hast a mind to
any thing I have, you shan't be Hector'd by him;
the Boy is a pretty Boy, I assure, you, <HI>says she,</HI> to a∣nother
Woman that was by this time come to her,
ay, <HI>says the 'tother,</HI> so he is, a very well looking
Child, if he was clean and well dress'd, and may be
as good a Gentleman's Son for any thing we know,
as any of those that are well dress'd; come my
Dear, <HI>says she,</HI> tell me what is it you wou'd have?
she pleas'd me mightily to hear her Talk of my
being a Gentleman's Son, and it brought former
things to mind, but when she talk'd of my being
not Clean, and in Rags, then I cry'd.</P>
<P>SHE press'd me to tell her, if I saw any thing
that I wanted, I told her no, all the Cloths I
saw there, were too big for me; come Child, <HI>says
she,</HI> I have two things here that will fit you, and
I am sure you want them both, that is, first a lit∣tle
Hat, and there, <HI>says she, tossing it to me,</HI> I'll
give you that for nothing; and here is a good
warm Pair of Breeches; I dare say, <HI>says she,</HI> they
will fit you, and they are very tite, and good;
and, <HI>says she,</HI> if you should ever come to have so
much Money, that you don't know what to do
with it, here are excellent good Pockets, says<HI>she,</HI> and a little Fob to put your Gold in, or your
Watch in, when you get it.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="40"/>
IT struck me with a strange kind of Joy, that
I should have a Place to put my Money in, and
need not go to hide it again in a Hollow-Tree;
that I was ready to snatch the Breeches out of her
Hands, and wonder'd that I should be such a Fool,
never to think of buying me a pair of Breeches
before, that I might have a Pocket to put my
Money in, and not carry it about two Days to∣gether
in my Hand, and in my Shoe, and I knew
not how; so in a Word, I gave her two Shillings
for the Breeches, and went over into the Church∣yard
and put them on, put my Money into my new
Pockets, and was as pleas'd as a Prince is with his
Coach and six Horses; I thank'd the good Wo∣man
too for the Hat, and told her I would come
again when I got more Money, and buy some o∣ther
things I wanted, and so I came away.</P>
<P>I WAS but a Boy 'tis true, but I thought my
self a Man now I had got a Pocket to put my Mo∣ney
in, and I went directly to find out my Com∣panion,
by whose means I got it; but I was fright∣ed
out of my Wits when I heard that he was car∣ried
to <HI>Bridewell;</HI> I made no Question but it was
for the Letter Case, and that I should be carried
there too, and then my poor Brother Captain <HI>Jack's</HI>
Case came into my Head, and that I should be
Whip'd there as cruelly as he was, and I was in
such a fright that I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>BUT in the Afternoon I met him, he had
been carried to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> it seems upon that very
Affair, but was got out again: The Case was thus,
having had such good Luck at the Custom-House
the Day before, he takes his Walk thither again,
and as he was in the long Room, gaping and staring
about him, a Fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays hold of him, and calls
to one of the Clerks, that sat behind, <HI>here,</HI> says
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
he, <HI>is the same young Rogue, that I told you I saw
Loitering about t'other Day when the Gentleman lost
his Letter Case, and his Goldsmith's Bills; I dare say
it was he that stole them;</HI> immediately the whole
Crowd of People gather'd about the Boy, and
Charg'd him point Blank; but he was too well
us'd to such things to be frighted into a Confessi∣on
of what he knew they could not prove, for
he had nothing about him belonging to it, not
had any Money, but Six-pence and a few dirty
Farthings.</P>
<P>THEY threatened him, and pull'd, and hall'd
him, till they almost pull'd the Cloths off of his
Back, and the Commissioners examin'd him; but all
was one, he would own nothing, but <HI>said, he</HI> walk'd
up thro' the Room only to see the Place both then,
and the time before, for he had own'd he was
there before; so as there was no proof against
him of any Fact, no, nor of any Circumstances
relating to the Letter Case, they were forc'd
at last to let him go; however, they made a show
of carrying him to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and they did carry
him to the Gate, to see if they could make him
confess any thing; but he would confess nothing,
and they had no <HI>Mittimus;</HI> so they durst not car∣ry
him into the House, nor would the People
have receiv'd him I suppose, if they had, they
having no Warrant for putting him in Prison.</P>
<P>WELL, when they could get nothing out of him
they carry'd him into an Ale-house, and there they
told him, that the Letter Case had Bills in it of a
very great Value, that they would be of no use to
the Rogue that had them, but they would be of infi∣nite
Damage to the Gentleman, that had lost them,
and that he had left word with the Clerk, who the
Man that stop'd this Boy had call'd to, and who
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
was there with him, that he would give 30 <HI>l.</HI> to
any one that would bring them again, and give
all the Security that could be desir'd that he would
give them no Trouble, whoever it was.</P>
<P>HE was just come from out of their Hands, when
Imet with him, and so he told me all the Story;
<HI>but,</HI> says he, <HI>I would confess nothing, and so I got
off and am come away clear.</HI> Well, says I, <HI>and what
will you do with the Letter Case, and the Bills, will
not you let the poor Man have his Bills again?</HI> No,
not, I, <HI>says he,</HI> I won't trust them, what care I
for their Bills; It came into my Head, as young
as I was, that it was a sad thing indeed to take
a Man's Bills away for so much Money, and not
have any Advantage by it neither; for I conclud∣ed
that the Gentleman, who own'd the Bills must
loose all the Money, and it was strange he should
keep the Bills, and make a Gentleman loose so
much Money for nothing: I remember that I ru∣minated
very much about it, and tho' I did not un∣derstand
it very well, yet it lay upon my Mind,
and I said every now and then to him, do, let the
Gentleman have his Bills again, do, pray do, and
so I Teiz'd him, with do, and pray do, till at last
I cry'd about them; he said, what would you have
me be found out and sent to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and be
Whip'd as your Brother Captain <HI>Jack</HI> was, I said
no I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not have you Whipt, but I would
have the Man have his Bills, for they will do you
no good, but the Gentleman will be undone it
may be; <HI>and then, I added again,</HI> do, let him have
them; he snapt me short, <HI>Why,</HI> says he, <HI>how shall
I get them to him? who dare carry them? I dare not
to be sure, for they will st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p me, and bring the</HI> Gold∣smith
<HI>to see if he does not know me, and that I receiv∣ed
the Money, and so they will prove the Robbery, and
I shall be hang'd, would you have me be hang'd</HI> Jack?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="43"/>
I WAS silenc'd a good while with that, for
when he said, would you have me be hang'd <HI>Jack?</HI>
I had no more to say; but one Day after this,
he call'd to me, Colonel <HI>Jack, said he,</HI> I have
thought of a way how the Gentleman shall have
his Bills again, and you and I shall get a good
deal of Money by it, if you will be honest to
me, as I was to you; indeed, <HI>says I</HI> ROBIN,
that was his Name, I will be very honest, let me
know how it is, for I would fain have him have
his Bills.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says he,</HI> they told me that he had left word
at the Clerk's Place in the Long Room, that he
would give 30 <HI>l.</HI> to any one that had the Bills, and
would restore them, and would ask no Questions.
Now if you will go, like a poor innocent Boy as
you are, into the Long Room, and speak to the
Clerk, it may do; tell him, if the Gentleman
will do as he promis'd, you believe you can tell
him who has it, and if they are civil to you, and
willing to be as good as their Words, you shall
have the Letter Case, and give it them.</P>
<P>I TOLD him aye, I would go with all my
Heart; but Colonel <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> what if they
should take hold of you, and threaten to have
you whip'd, won't you discover me to them; no,
<HI>says I,</HI> if they would whip me to Death I won't;
well then, says he, <HI>there's the Letter Case, do you
go;</HI> so he gave me Directions how to act, and
what to say, but I would not take the Letter Case
with me, least they should prove false, and take
hold of me, thinking to find it upon me, and so
Charge me with the Fact; so I left it with
him; and the next Morning I went to the
Custom-House, as was agreed, what my Directi∣ons
were, will to avoid Repetition, appear in
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
what happen'd; It was an Errand of foo much
Consequence indeed to be entrusted to a Boy, not
only so young as I was, but so little of a Rogue
as I was yet arriv'd to the Degree of.</P>
<P>TWO things I was particularly arm'd with,
which I resolv'd upon. (1.) That the Man should
have his Bills again; for it seem'd a horrible
thing to me that he should be made to lose his
Money, which I suppos'd he must, purely because
we would not carry the Letter Case home. (2.)
That whatever happen'd to me, I was never to tell
the Name of my Comrade <HI>Robin,</HI> who had been
the Principal: With these two Peices of honesty,
for such they were both in themselves, and with a
manly Heart, tho' a Boy's Head, I went up into
the Long Room in the Custom-House the next
Day.</P>
<P>As soon as I came to the Place, where the thing
was done, I saw the Man sit just where he had sat
before, and it run in my Head, that he had sat
there ever since; but I knew no better; so I went
up and stood just at that Side of the writing Board,
that goes up on that Side of the Room, and
which I was but just Tall enough to lay my Arms
upon.</P>
<P>WHILE I stood there, one thrust me this way,
and another thrust me that way, and the Man that
sat behind began to look at me; at last he call'd
out to me; what does that Boy do there, get you
gone Sirrah, are you one of the Rogues that stole
the Gentleman's Letter Case a <HI>Monday</HI> last? Then
he turns his Tale to a Gentleman that was do∣ing
Business with him, and goes on thus; here was
Mr.—had a very unlucky Chance on <HI>Mon∣day</HI>
last, did not you hear of it; no, not I, <HI>says the
Gentleman,</HI> Why? standing just there, where you
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
do, <HI>says he,</HI> making his Entries, he pull'd out his
Letter Case, and laid it down, as <HI>he says,</HI> but just
at this Hand, while he reach'd over to the Standish
there for a Penful of Ink, and some Body stole
away his Letter Case.</P>
<P>HIS Letter Case! <HI>says 'tother,</HI> What? and was
there any Bills in it?</P>
<P>AY, <HI>says he,</HI> there was Sir <HI>Stephen Evans</HI>'s Note
in it for 300 <HI>l.</HI> and another Goldsmith's Bill, for
about 12 <HI>l.</HI> and which is worse still for the Genle∣man,
he had two Foreign accepted Bills in it
for a great Sum, I know not how much, I think
one was a <HI>French</HI> Bill for 1200 Crowns.</P>
<P>AND who cou'd it be? <HI>says the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>NO BODY knows, <HI>says he,</HI> but one of our Room∣Keepers
<HI>says,</HI> he saw a Couple of young Rogues
like that, <HI>pointing at me,</HI> hanging about here,
and that on a sudden they were both gone.</P>
<P>VILLIANS! <HI>says he</HI> again, Why? what can
they do with them, they will be of no use to
them; I suppose he went immediately, and gave
notice to prevent the Payment.</P>
<P>YES, <HI>says the Clerk,</HI> he did; but the Rogues
were to nimble for him with the little Bill of 12 <HI>l.</HI>
odd Money, they went and got the Money for
that, but all the rest are stopp'd, however, 'tis
an unspeakable Damage to him for want of his
Money.</P>
<P>WHY, he should publish a Reward for the En∣couragement
of those that have them to bring
them again, they would be glad to bring them
I warrant you.</P>
<P>HE has posted it up at the Door, that he will
give 30 <HI>l.</HI> for them.</P>
<P>AYE, but he should add, that he will promise,
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
not to stop, or give any Trouble to the Person
that brings them.</P>
<P>HE has done that too, <HI>says he,</HI> but I fear they
won't trust themselves to be Honest, for fear he
should break his Word.</P>
<P>Why? it is true he may break his Word in that
Case, but no Man should do so; for then, no
Rogue will venture to bring home any thing that
is stolen, and so he would do an Injury to others
after him.</P>
<P>I DURST pawn my Life for him, he would
scorn it.</P>
<P>THUS far they Discours'd of it, and then went
off to something else; I heard it all, but did not
know what to do a great while; but at last, watch∣ing
the Gentleman that went away, when he was
gone, I run after him, to have spoken to him, in∣tending
to have broke it to him, but he went
hastily into a Room or Two, full of People, at
the hither End of the Long Room, and when I
went to follow, the Door-keepers turn'd me Back,
and told me I must not go in there; so I went Back,
and loyter'd about, near the Man that sat behind
the Board, and hung about there, 'till I found the
Clock struck Twelve, and the Room began to be
thin of People; and at last he sat there Writing,
but no Body stood at the Board before him, as
there had all the rest of the Morning, then I came
a little nearer, and stood close to the Board, as I
did before, when looking up from his Paper, and
seeingme, <HI>says he to me,</HI> you have been up and
down there all this Morning, Sarrah, What do
you want? You have some Business that is not
very good, I doubt?</P>
<P>No, I han't, said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47"/>
No, 'tis well if you han't, <HI>says he,</HI> Pray what
Business can you have, in the Long Room, Sir,
you are no Merchant?</P>
<P>I would speak with you, <HI>said I</HI></P>
<P>With me, <HI>saye he,</HI> What have you to say to
me?</P>
<P>I have something to say, <HI>said I,</HI> if you will
do me no Harm for it.</P>
<P>I do thee Harm Child, What Harm should I
do thee? and spoke very kindly.</P>
<P>Won't you indeed Sir, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>No, not I Child! I'll do thee no Harm; what
is it? do you know any Thing of the Gentle∣man's
Letter Case.</P>
<P>I answer'd, but spoke softly, that he could not
hear me, so he gets over presently, into the Seat
next him, and opens a Place that was made to
come out, and bad me come in to him; and I
did.</P>
<P>Then he ask'd me again, if I knew any thing
of the Letter-Case</P>
<P>I spoke softly again, and said, Folks would
hear him.</P>
<P>Then he whisper'd softly, and ask'd me again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>I told him, I believ'd I did; but that, indeed,
I had it not, nor had no Hand in stealing it, but
it was goten into the Hands of a Boy, that would
have burnt it, if it had not been for me; and
that I heard him say, that the Gentleman would
be glad to have them again, and give a good deal
of Money for them.</P>
<P>I did say so Child, <HI>said he,</HI> and if you can get
them for him, he shall give you a good Reward,
no less than 30 <HI>l.</HI> as he has Promis'd.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48"/>
But you said too Sir, to the Gentleman, just
now, <HI>said I,</HI> that you was sure he would not bring
them into any Harm that should bring them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you shall come to no Harm; I will
pass my Word for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy,</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shan't they make me bring other Peo∣ple
into trouble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you shall not be ask'd the Name of
any Body, nor to tell who they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am but a poor Boy, and I would fain
have the Gentleman have his Bills, and indeed,
I did not take them away, nor I han't got
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you tell how the Gentleman shall
have them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I can get them, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>will bring them to
you, to Morrow Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you not do it to Night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I may, If I knew where to
come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come to my House Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know where you Live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go along with me now, and you shall
see.</P>
</SP>
<P>So he carry'd me up into <HI>Tower-street.</HI> and
show'd me his House, and order'd me to come
there at five a Clock at Night, which accord∣ingly
I did, and carry'd the Letter-Case with
me.</P>
<P>When I came, the Gentleman ask'd me if I
had brought the Book, <HI>as he call'd it.</HI></P>
<P>It is not a Book, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>No, the Letter-Case, that's all one, <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>You promis'd me, <HI>said I,</HI> you would not hurt
me, <HI>and cry'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49"/>
Don't be affraid Child, <HI>says he,</HI> I will not hurt
thee, <HI>poor Boy!</HI> no Body shall hurt thee.</P>
<P>Here it is, <HI>said I,</HI> and pull'd it out.</P>
<P>He then brought in another Gentleman, who it
seems own'd the Letter-Case, <HI>and ask'd him,</HI> If
that was it? <HI>and he said,</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>ask'd me,</HI> If all the Bills were in it.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I heard him say, there was one gone,
but I believed there was all the rest.</P>
<P>Why do you believe so? <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P>Because, I heard the Boy, that I believe stole
them, say, they were too big for him to meddle
with.</P>
<P>The Gentleman then that own'd them, said,
Where is the Boy?</P>
<P>Then the other Gentleman put in, <HI>and said,</HI>
no, you must not ask him that, I pass'd my Word,
that you should not, and that he should not be
oblig'd to tell it to any Body.</P>
<P>Well Child, <HI>says he,</HI> You will let us see,
the Letter-Case open'd, and whether the Bills
are in it?</P>
<P>Yes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>says I.</HI></P>
<P>Then the first Centleman said, how many Bills
were there in it?</P>
<P>Only three, <HI>says he,</HI> besides the Bill of 12<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI>
there was Sir <HI>Stephen Evans</HI>'s Note for 300 <HI>l.</HI> and
two Foreign Bills.</P>
<P>Well then, if they are in the Letter-Case, the
Boy shall have 30<HI>l.</HI> shall he not? Yes, <HI>says the
Gentleman,</HI> he shall have it very freely.</P>
<P>Come then, Child, <HI>says he,</HI> let me open it.</P>
<P>So I gave it him, and he open'd it, and there
were all the three Bills, and several other Papers,
fair and safe, nothing defac'd, or diminish'd, and
the Gentleman said all was right.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"/>
Then said the first Man, then I am Security to
the poor Boy for the Money; well, but, <HI>says the
Gentleman,</HI> the Rogues have got the 12<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI>
they ought to reckon that, as Part of the 30<HI>l.</HI> had
he ask'd me, I should have consented to it at first
Word: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>But the first Man stood my Friend, Nay,
<HI>says he,</HI> it was since you knew that the 12 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> was
receiv'd, that you offer'd 30 <HI>l.</HI> for the other Bills,
and publish'd it by the Cryer, and posted it up
at the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Door, and I promis'd him the
30 <HI>l.</HI> this Morning; they argu'd long, and I thought
would have quarel'd about it.</P>
<P>However, at last they both yielded a little, and
the Gentleman gave me 25<HI>l.</HI> in good Guineas;
when he gave it me, he bad me hold out my
Hand, and he told the Money into my Hand, and
when he had done, he ask'd me if it was right, I
said, I did not know, but I believ'd it was: Why,
<HI>says he,</HI> can't you tell it? I told him no, I never
saw so much Money in my Life, nor I did not
know how to tell Money: Why, <HI>says he,</HI> Don't
you know that they are Guineas; no, <HI>I told him,</HI>
I did not know how much a Guinea was.</P>
<P>Why, how then, <HI>says he,</HI> did you tell me you
believ'd it was Right? <HI>I told him,</HI> because, I be∣liev'd
he would not give it me wrong.</P>
<P>Poor Child! <HI>says he,</HI> Thou knowest little of the
World, indeed; what art thou?</P>
<P>I am a poor Boy, <HI>says I,</HI> and cry'd.</P>
<P>What is your Name, <HI>says he,</HI> but hold, I forgot,
<HI>said he,</HI> I promised, I would not ask your Name,
so you need not tell me.</P>
<P>My Name is <HI>Jack, said I.</HI></P>
<P>Why, have you no Sir-Name? <HI>Said be.</HI></P>
<P>What is that? <HI>Said I.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/>
You have some other Name; besides <HI>Jack,
says he,</HI> han't you?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says I,</HI> They call me, <HI>Col. Jack.</HI></P>
<P>But have you no other Name?</P>
<P>No, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>How come you to be call'd, <HI>Col. Jack,</HI> pray.</P>
<P>They say, <HI>said I,</HI> my Father's Name was <HI>Col.</HI></P>
<P>Is your Father or Mother alive? <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P>No, <HI>said I,</HI> my Father is dead.</P>
<P>Where is your Mother then, <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P>I never had er'e a Mother, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>This made him laugh; what, <HI>said he,</HI> had you
ne'er a Mother, what then?</P>
<P>I had a Nurse, <HI>said I,</HI> but she was not my Mo∣ther.</P>
<P>Well,
<HI>says he to the Gentleman,</HI> I dare say, this
Boy was not the Thief that stole your Bills.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I did not steal them, <HI>said I,</HI> and
Cry'd again.</P>
<P>No, no, Child, <HI>said he,</HI> we don't believe you
did.</P>
<P>THIS is a cleaver Boy, <HI>says he,</HI> to the other
Gentleman, and yet very Ignorant and Honest,
'tis pity some Care should not be taken of him,
and something done for him; let us Talk a little
more with him; so they sat down and drank
Wine, and gave me some, and then the first Gen∣tleman
talk'd to me again.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says he,</HI> What wil't thou do with this
Money now thou hast it?</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>Where will you put it? <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P>In my Pocket, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>In your Pocket, <HI>said he,</HI> is your Pocket whole?
shan't you lose it?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>said I,</HI> my Pocket is whole.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52"/>
And where will you put it, when you come
Home?</P>
<P>I have no Home, <HI>said I, and cry'd</HI> again.</P>
<P>Poor Child! <HI>said he then,</HI> What doest thou do
for thy Living?</P>
<P>I go of Errands, <HI>said I,</HI> for the Folks in <HI>Rose∣mary-lane.</HI></P>
<P>And what dost thou do for a Lodging at Night?</P>
<P>I lye at the Glass-House, <HI>said I,</HI> at Night.</P>
<P>How lye at the Glass-House! have they any
Beds there? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>I never lay in a Bed in my Life, <HI>said I,</HI> as I
remember.</P>
<P>Why? <HI>says he,</HI> what do you lye on at the Glass-House?</P>
<P>The Ground, <HI>says I,</HI> and sometimes a little
Straw, or upon the warm Ashes.</P>
<P>Here the Gentleman, that lost the Bills, <HI>said,</HI> this
poor Child is enough to make a Man Weep for the
Miseries of humane Nature, and be thankful for
himself, he puts Tears into my Eyes; and into
mine too, <HI>says the other.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but <HI>Hark ye</HI> Jack? <HI>says the first Gentle∣man,</HI>
do they give you no Money, when they
send you of Errands?</P>
<P>They give me Victuals, <HI>said I,</HI> and that's better.</P>
<P>But what, <HI>says he,</HI> do you do for Cloths?</P>
<P>They give me sometimes old things, <HI>said I,</HI> such
as they have to spare.</P>
<P>Why? you have ne're a Shirt on I believe,
<HI>said he,</HI> have you?</P>
<P>No, I never had a Shirt, <HI>said I,</HI> since my Nurse
dyed.</P>
<P>How long ago is that? <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P>Six Winters, when this is out, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>Why, how Old are you? <HI>said he.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53"/>
I can't tell, <HI>said I,</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> now you have this
Money, won't you buy some Cloths, and a Shirt
with some of it.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>said I,</HI> I would buy some Cloths.</P>
<P>And, what will you do with the rest?</P>
<P>I can't tell, <HI>said I,</HI> and cry'd.</P>
<P>What doest cry for <HI>Jack,</HI> said he.</P>
<P>I am afraid, <HI>said I,</HI> and cryed still.</P>
<P>What art afraid of.</P>
<P>They will know I have Money.</P>
<P>Well, and what then.</P>
<P>Then I must sleep no more in the warm Glass-house,
and I shall be starv'd with cold.</P>
<P>They will take away my Money.</P>
<P>But why must you sleep there no more?</P>
<P>Here the Gentlemen observ'd to one another,
how naturally Anxiety and Perplexity attends
those that have Money; I warrant you, <HI>says the
Clerk,</HI> when this poor Boy had no Money, he slept
all Night in the Straw or on the warm Ashes in the
Glass-House, as soundly and as void of Care as it
would be possible for any Creature to do; But now as
soon as he has gotten Money, the Care of preserving
it brings Tears into his Eyes, and Fear into his Heart.</P>
<P>THEY ask'd me a great many Questions more,
to which I answer'd in my Childish way as well
as I could, but so as pleas'd them well enough;
at last I was going away with a heavy Pocket,
and I assure you not a light Heart, for I was so
frighted with having so much Money, that knew
not what in the Earth to do with my self: I went
away however, and walk'd a little way, but I
could not tell what to do; so after rambling
two Hours or thereabout, I went back again,
and satd own at the Gentleman's Door, and there
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
I cry'd as long as I had any Moisture in my Head
to make Tears of, but never knock'd at the Door.</P>
<P>I had not sat long, I suppose, but some body
belonging to the Family got knowledge of it,
and a Maid came and talked to me, but I said
little to her, only cry'd still, at length it came
to the Gentleman's Ears; as for the Merchant he
was gone; when the Gentleman heard of me, he
call'd me in, and began to talk with me again,
and ask'd me what I staid for.</P>
<P>I told him I had not staid there all that while,
for I had been gone a great while, and was come
again.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says he,</HI> but what did you come again for?</P>
<P>I can't tell, <HI>says I.</HI></P>
<P>And what do you cry so for, <HI>said he,</HI> I hope
you have not lost your Money, have you?</P>
<P>No, I told him I had not lost it yet, but I was
afraid I should.</P>
<P>And does that make you cry? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>I told him <HI>yes,</HI> for I knew I should not be able
to keep it, but <HI>they</HI> would Cheat me of it, or <HI>they</HI>
would Kill me, and take it away from me too.</P>
<P><HI>They,</HI> says he, Who? what sort of Gangs of
People art thou with?</P>
<P>I told him they were all Boys, but very wick∣ed
Boys, Thieves and Pick-Pockets, <HI>said I,</HI> such
as stole this Letter Case, a sad Pack, I can't a∣bide
'em.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Jack,</HI> said he, what shall be done for
shee? will you leave it with me, shall I keep it
for you?</P>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> said I, with all my Heart, if you please.</P>
<P>Come then, <HI>says he,</HI> give it me, and that you
may be sure I have it, and you shall have it ho∣nestly
again, I'll give you a Bill for it,
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
and for the Interest of it, and that you may keep
safe enough; <HI>nay,</HI> added he, and if you lose it or
any Body takes it from you, none shall receive
the Money but your self, or any part of it.</P>
<P>I presently pull'd out all the Money, and
gave it to him, only keeping about Fifteen Shil∣lings
for myself to buy me some Cloaths, and
thus ended the Conference between us on the first
occasion, at least for the first time: Having thus
secured my Money to my full Satisfaction, I was
then perfectly easie, and accordingly the sad
Thoughts that afflicted my Mind before began to
vanish away.</P>
<P>THIS was enough to let any one see how all
the Sorrows and Anxieties of Men's Lives come
about, how they rise from their Restless pushing
at getting of Money, and the restless Cares of
keeping it when they have got it. I that had
nothing, and had not known what it was to have
had any thing, knew nothing of the Care, either
of getting, or of keeping; I wanted nothing, who
wanted every thing; I had no Care, no Concern
about where I should get my Victuals, or how I
should Lodge, I knew not what Money was, or
what to do with it; and never knew what it was
not to sleep, till I had Money to keep, and was
afraid of losing it.</P>
<P>I HAD without doubt an opportunity at this
time, if I had not been too foolish, and too much
a Child to speak for myself; I had an opportuni∣ty,
<HI>I say,</HI> to have got into the Service, or per∣haps
to be under some of the Care and Concern
of these Gentlemen, for they seem'd to be very
fond of doing something for me, and were sur∣priz'd
at the Innocence of my Talk to them, as
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
well as at the Misery (as they thought) it of my
Condition.</P>
<P>BUT I acted indeed like a Child, and leaving
my Money, <HI>as I have said,</HI> I never went near
them for several Years after; what Course I took,
and what befel me in that Interval, has so much
Variety in it, and carries so much Instruction in
it, that requires an Account of it by it self.</P>
<P>THE first happy Chance, that offer'd it self to
me in the World, was now over; I had got
Money, but I neither knew the Value of it, or the
Use of it; the Way of Living I had begun, was
so natural to me, I had no Notion of bettering it;
I had not so much as any Desire of Buying me
any Cloths, no not so much as a Shirt, and much
less, had I any Thought of getting any other
Lodging, than that in the <HI>Glass-House,</HI> and loyter∣ing
about the Streets as I had done: For I knew
no Good, and had tasted no Evil; <HI>that is to say,</HI> the
Life I had led, being not Evil in my Account.</P>
<P>IN this State of Ignorance, I return'd to my
really miserable Life, so it was in it self, and was
only not so to me, because I did not understand
how to judge of it, and had known no better.</P>
<P>MY Comrade that gave me back the Bills, and
who if I had not press'd him, design'd never to
have restor'd them, never ask'd me what I had gi∣ven
me, but told me, if they gave me any thing it
should be my own; for as <HI>he said,</HI> he would not run
the venture of being seen in the restoring them, I
deserv'd the Reward if there was any; neither did
he trouble his Head with enquiring what I had,
or whether I had any thing or no; so my Title
to what I had got was clear.</P>
<P>I WENT now, up and down just as I did before;
I had Money indeed in my Pocket, but I let no
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
Body know it; I went of Errands chearfully, as
before, and accepted of what any Body gave me
with as much Thankfulness as ever; the only
difference that I made with myself, was, that if I
was a Hungry, and no Body employ'd me, or
gave me any thing to Eat, I did not beg from
Door to Door, as I did at first, but went to a
boyling House, <HI>as I said once before,</HI> and got a
Mess of Broth, and a piece of Bread, Price a Half-penny;
very seldom any Meat; or if I treated
myself, it was a Half-penny worth of Cheese;
all which Expence did not Amount to above 2<HI>d.</HI>
or 3 <HI>d.</HI> a Week; for contrary to the usage of the
rest of the Tribe, I was extremly Frugal, and I
had not dispos'd of any of the Guineas, which I had
at first; neither, <HI>as I said,</HI> to the Custom-House
Gentleman, could I tell what a Guniea was made
of, or what it was worth.</P>
<P>AFTER I had been about a Month thus, and had
done nothing, my Comrade, <HI>as I call'd him,</HI> came to
me one Morning, Col. <HI>Jack,</HI> says he, When shall
you and I, take a walk again? when you will, <HI>said
I:</HI> Have you got no Business yet? <HI>says he,</HI> no, <HI>says I,</HI>
and so one thing bringing in another, he told me, I.
was a fortunate Wretch; and he believed I would be
so again; but that he must make a new Bargain with
me now, for <HI>says he,</HI> Col. the first time we always let
a raw Brother come in for full share, to Encourage
him, but afterward, except it be when he puts him∣self
forward well, and runs equal Hazard, he stands
to Courtisie; but as we are Gentlemen, we always
do very Honourably by one another; and if you
are willing to trust it or leave it to me, I shall
do handsomly by you, that you may depend
upon. I told him, I was not able to do any
thing, that was certain, for I did not understand
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
it, and therefore I cou'd not expect to get any
thing, but I would do as he bad me, so we walk'd
Abroad together.</P>
<P>WE went no more to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> it was
too bold a Venture; besides, I did not care to
shew my self again, especially with him in Com∣pany;
but we went directly to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and
we hanker'd about in <HI>Castle-Alley,</HI> and in <HI>Swithins∣alley,</HI>
and at the Coffee-house-doors. 'Twas a very
unlucky Day, for we got nothing all Day, but 2
or 3 Hankerchiefs, and came home to the old
Lodging, at the <HI>Glass house;</HI> nor had I had any
thing to Eat or Drink all Day, but a piece of
Bread, which he gave me, and some Water at the
Conduit at the <HI>Exchange gate:</HI> So when he was gone
from me, for he did not lye in the <HI>Glass-house,</HI> as
I did, I went to my old Broth-house for my usual
Bait; and refresh'd my self, and the next Day
early went to meet him again, as he appointed me.</P>
<P>BEING early in the Morning, he took his
Walk to <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> where it seems two Sorts of
People make a great Crowd as soon as it is Light;
and at that time a Year, rather before Day light,
<HI>that is to say, Crimps,</HI> and the Masters of <HI>Coal Ships,</HI>
who they call <HI>Collyer Masters;</HI> and Secondly, Fish∣mongers,
Fish-sellers and Buyers of Fish.</P>
<P>IT was the first of these People that he had his
Eye upon: So he gives me my Orders, which was
thus; go you, <HI>says he,</HI> into all the Ale-houses as
we go along, and Observe, where any People are
telling of Money, and when you find any, come
and tell me; so he stood at the Door, and I went
into the Houses: As the <HI>Collyer Masters</HI> generally
Sell their Coals at the Gate, <HI>as they call it, So</HI>
they generally receive their Money in those Ale∣houses,
and it was not long before I brought him
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
Word of several; upon this he went in, and made
his Observations, but found nothing to his pur∣pose;
at length I brought him Word, that there
was a Man in such a House, who had received a
great deal of Money of some body, I believ'd of
several People, and that it lay all upon the Table
in Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and he was very busy Writing down
the Sums, and putting it up in several Bags; is he?
<HI>says he,</HI> I'll warrant him, I will have some of it,
and in he goes, he Walks up and down the House,
which had several open Tables and Boxes in it,
and lissened to hear if he could what the Man's
Name was, and he heard some body call him <HI>Cul∣lum,</HI>
or some such a Name; then he watches his
Opportunity, and steps up to him, and tells him
a long Story, that there was two Gentlemen at
the <HI>Gun-Tavern</HI> sent him to Enquire for him, and
to tell him they desired to speak with him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Collier</HI> Master had his Money lay be∣fore
him, just as I had told him; and had two
or three small Payments of Money, which he
had put up in little Black Dirty Baggs, and lay
by themselves; and as it was hardly broad
Day, he found means in delivering his Message;
to lay his Hand upon one of those Baggs, and
carry it off perfectly undiscover'd.</P>
<P>WHEN he had got it, he came out to me,
who stood but at the Door, and pulling me by the
Sleeve; run <HI>Jack,</HI> says he, for our Lives, and
away he Scours; and I after him, never resting or
scarce looking about me, till we got quite up into
<HI>Fenchurch street,</HI> thro' <HI>Lime-street,</HI> into <HI>Leaden∣hall
street,</HI> down St. <HI>Mary axe,</HI> to <HI>London Wall,</HI> than
thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Bishop gate,</HI> and down old <HI>Bedlam,</HI> into <HI>Moor∣fields.</HI>
By this time we were neither of us able
to run very fast, nor need we have gone so far,
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
for I never found that any body Persued us:
When we got into <HI>Moorsields;</HI> and began to take
Breath, I ask'd him what it was frighted him so?
<HI>fright me,</HI> you Fool, <HI>says he,</HI> I <HI>have got a Devilish great
Bag of Money:</HI> A Bag! <HI>said I,</HI> ay, ay, said he, let us
get out into the Fields, where no Body can see us,
and I'll shew it you; so away he had me through
<HI>Long-alley,</HI> and Cross <HI>Hog-lane,</HI> and <HI>Holloway lane,</HI>
into the middle of the great Field, which since
that, has been call'd the <HI>Farthing pye-house-field:</HI>
There we wou'd have sat down, but it was all full
of Water; so we went on, cross'd the Road at <HI>Anni∣seed
Cleer,</HI> and went into the Field where now
the Great Hospital stands: And finding a by place,
we sat down, and he Pulls out the Bag; thou art
a lucky Boy, <HI>Jack,</HI> says he; thou deservest a good
share of this Jobb truly, for 'tis all long of thy
lucky News, so he pours it all out into my Hat;
for, as I told you, I now wore a Hat.</P>
<P>How he did to Whip away such a Bagg of Mo∣ney
from any Man that was Awake, and in his
Senses; I cannot tell; But there was a great deal
in it; and among it, a Paper full by it self: When
the Paper dropt out of the Bag, hold, <HI>says he,</HI> that's
Gold; and began to Crow and Hallow like a mad
Boy, but there he was Bank'd; for it was a Paper
of old Thirteen-pence-half-penny peices, half,
and Quarter Peices, with Nine pences and Four-pence-half-penny's,
all old Crooked Money, <HI>Scots</HI>
and <HI>Irish</HI> Coin, so he was disappointed in that; but
as it was, there was about 17 or 18 Pound in the
Bag as I understood by him, for I cou'd not tell
Money, not I.</P>
<P>WELL, he parted this Money into three, that
is to say, into three Shares; two for himself, and
one for me, and ask'd if I was Content, I told him
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
yes, I had reason to be Contented; besides, it
was so much Money added to that I had left of his
former Adventure, that I knew not what to do
with it, or with my self, while I had so much
about me.</P>
<P>THIS was a most Exquisite Fellow for a Thief,
for he had the greatest Dexterity at Conveying
any thing away; that he scarse ever Pitch'd upon
any thing in his Eye, but he carried it off with
his Hands, and never that I know of, miss'd his
Aim, or was catch'd in the Fact.</P>
<P>HE was an Eminent Pick-pocket, and very Dex∣trous
at the Ladies Gold Watches; but he gene∣rally
push'd higher at such desperate Things as
those, and he came off the cleanest, and with the
greatest Success Imaginable; and it was in these
Kinds of the wicked Art of Thieving, that I be∣came
his Scholar.</P>
<P>As we were now so Rich, he would not let me
lye any longer in the <HI>Glass-house,</HI> or go Naked,
and Ragged, as I had done; but oblig'd me to buy
two Shirts, a Wastcoat, and a Great Coat, for a
Great Coat was more for our purpose, in the Busi∣ness
we was upon than any other: So I Cloathed
my self as he Directed, and he took me a Lodging
in the same House with him, and we Lodg'd toge∣ther
in a little Garret fit for our Quality.</P>
<P>SOON after this, we Walk'd out again, and
then we try'd our Fortune in the places, by the
<HI>Exchange</HI> a Second time. Here we began to act
separately, and I undertook to Walk by my self,
and the first thing I did accurately, was a trick I
play'd, that argued some Skill, for a new Begin∣ner,
for I had never seen any Business of that
Kind done before: I saw two Gentlemen mighty
Eager in Talk, and one pull'd out a Pocket-book
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
two or three times, and then slipt it into his Coat∣pocket
again, and then out it came again, and
Papers were taken out, and others put in; and
then in it went again, and so several times, the
Man being still warmly Engag'd with another
Man, and two or three others standing hard by
them; the last time he put his Pocket-book into
his Pocket, he might have been said, to thro' it in,
rather than put it in with his Hand, and the Book
Jay End way, resting upon some other Book, or
something else in his Pocket; so that it did not
go quite down, but one Corner of it was seen a∣bove
his Pocket.</P>
<P>THIS Careless way of Men putting their Pock∣et-books
into a Coat-pocket, which is so easily
Div'd into, by the least Boy that has been us'd
to the Trade, can never be too much blam'd; the
Gentlemen are in great Hurries, their Heads and
Thoughts entirely taken up, and it is impossible
they should be Guarded enough against such little
Hawks Eyed Creatures, as we were; and there∣fore,
they ought either never to put their Pocket-books
up at all, or to put them up more secure,
or to put nothing of Value into them: I happen'd
to be just opposite to this Gentleman in that they
call <HI>Swithins-alley;</HI> or that Alley rather, which is
between <HI>Swithins-alley;</HI> and the <HI>Exchange;</HI> just by
a Passage that goes out of the Alley into the <HI>Ex∣change:</HI>
When seeing the Book pass, and repass,
into the Pocket, and out of the Pocket, as above,
it came immediately into my Head, certainly, I
might get that Pocket book out, if I were Nimble,
and I warrant <HI>Will</HI> would have it, if he saw it go
and come, to and again, as I did: But when I saw
it Hang by the way, as I have said; Now, 'tis
mine said I, to my self, and crosing the Alley, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
brush'd smoothly but closely by the Man, with
iny Hand down flat to my own Side, and taking
hold of it by the Corner that appear'd; the Book
came so light into my Hand, it was impossible
the Gentleman should feel the least motion, or
any body else see me take it away. I went di∣rectly
forward into the broad Place, on the North∣side
of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> thenscour'd down <HI>Bartholo∣mew-lane,</HI>
so into <HI>Token-house-yard,</HI> into the Alleys,
which pass thro from thence to <HI>London-wall,</HI> so
thro' <HI>Moor-gate,</HI> and sat down in the Grass, in the
Second of the Quarters of <HI>Moor-fields;</HI> towards the
middle Field; which was the Place that <HI>Will</HI> and
I had appointed to meet at, if either of us got any
Booty: When I came thither, <HI>Will</HI> was not come,
but I saw him a coming in about half an Hour.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Will</HI> came to me, I ask'd him what
Booty he had gotten; he look'd Pale, and as I
thought frighted: But he return'd, I have got no∣thing,
<HI>not I,</HI> but you lucky young Dog, <HI>says he,</HI>
what have you got, have not you got the Gentle∣man's
Pocket-book in <HI>Swithins-Alley:</HI> Yes, <HI>says I,</HI>
and Laught at him; why, how did you know it:
Know it! <HI>says he,</HI> why, the Gentleman is Raving
and half Distracted: He Stamps and Crys, and
Tears his very Cloths, <HI>he says</HI> he is utterly un∣done,
and ruin'd, and the Folks in the Alley say,
there is, I know not how many Thousand Pounds
in it; what can be in it, <HI>says</HI> Will, <HI>come let us see.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, we lay close in the Grass, in the Middle
of the Quarter; so that no body minded us, and
so we opened the Pocket-book, and there was a
great many Bills and Notes under Men's Hands;
some <HI>Gold-simiths,</HI> and some belonging to <HI>Insurance
Offices,</HI> as they call them, and the like: But that
which was, it seems, worth all the rest, was that
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
in one of the Folds of the Cover of the Book, where
there was a Case with several Partitions; there
was a Paper full of loose Diamonds: The Man
as we understood afterwards, was a <HI>Jew;</HI> who
dealt in such Goods, and who indeed ought to have
taken more Care of the keeping of them.</P>
<P>NOW was this Booty too great, even for <HI>Will</HI>
himself to Manage; for tho' by this time, I was
come to understand things better than I did for∣merly,
when I knew not what belong'd to Money;
yet, <HI>Will</HI> was better skill'd by far in those things
than I. But this puzzl'd him too as well as me:
Now, were we something like the Cock in the Fa∣ble;
for all these Bills, and I think there was one
Bill of Sir <HI>Henry Furness</HI>'s for 1200 Pounds, and
all these <HI>Diamonds,</HI> which were worth abott 150<HI>l.
as they said,</HI> I say, all these things were of no Va∣lue
to us; one little Purse of Gold would have
been better to us, than all of it: But, <HI>come says
Will,</HI> let us look over the Bills for a little one.</P>
<P>WE look'd over all the Bills, and among them;
we found a Bill under a Man's Hand for 32 <HI>l. come
says Will,</HI> let us go and Enquire where this Man
Lives: So we went into the City again, and <HI>Will</HI>
went to the <HI>Post bouse,</HI> and ask'd there, they told
him he liv'd at <HI>Temple-bar;</HI> Well, <HI>says Will,</HI> I
will venture; I'll go and receive the Money, it
may be he has not remembred to send to stop the
Payment there.</P>
<P>BUT it came into his thoughts, to take another
Course; <HI>come says Will,</HI> I'll go back to the Alley, and
see if I can hear any thing of what has happen'd,
for I believe the Hurry is not over yet; it seems the
Man who lost the Book was carried into the <HI>King's-Head-Tavern,</HI>
at the End of that Alley, and a
great Crowd was about the Door.
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
AWAY goes <HI>Will,</HI> and watches, and waits about
the Place, and then seeing several People together,
for they were not all dispers'd, he asks one or
two what was the Matter; they tell him a long
story of a Gentleman who had lost his Pocket-book,
with a great Bag of <HI>Diamonds</HI> in it, and Bills
for a great many Thousand Pounds, and I know
not what; and that they had been just then Cry∣ing
it, and had offer'd a Hundred Pound Reward,
to any one that would discover and restore it.</P>
<P>I WISH <HI>said he,</HI> to one of them, that Parled
with him, I did but know who has it; I dont
doubt but I would help him to it again; does he
remember nothing of any body, Boy, or Fellow
that was near him, if he cou'd but Describe him,
it might do; some body that over heard him
was so forward to assist the poor Gentleman, that
they went up and let him know what a young
Fellow, meaning <HI>Will,</HI> had been talking at the
Door, and down comes another Gentleman from
him, and taking <HI>Will aside, ask'd him what he bad
said about it? Will</HI> was a Grave sort of a young
Man, that tho' he was an old Soldier at the Trade,
had yet nothing of it in his Countenance, and he
answer'd, that he was concerned in Business
where a great many of the Gangs of little Pick-pockets
haunted; and if he had but the least Dis∣cription
of the Person that they Suspected, he durst
say, he cou'd find him out, and might perhaps get
the things again for him: Upon this, he de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd
him to go up with him to the Gentleman, which
he did accordi gly; and there he said he sat lean∣ing
his Head back in a Chair, Pale as a Cloth;
disconsolate to a strange Degree, and as <HI>Will</HI> de∣scrib'd
him, just like one under a Sentence.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="66"/>
WHEN they came to ask him whether he had
seen no Boy, or shabby Fellow lurking near where
he stood, or passing, and repassing? and the like,
he answer'd, no, not any; neither could he re∣member
that any Body had come near him; then
said <HI>Will,</HI> it will be very hard, if not impossible
to find them out: However, said <HI>Will,</HI> if you
think it worth while, I will put my self among
those Rogues, tho' <HI>says he,</HI> I care not for being
seen among them, but I will put in among them,
and if it be in any of those Gangs, it is ten to
one but I shall hear something of it.</P>
<P>THEY ask'd him then, if he had heard what
Terms the Gentleman had offer'd to have it re∣stor'd;
he answer'd, no; (tho' he had been told at
the Door,) they aswer'd, he had offer'd a Hundred
Pound; that is too much, <HI>says Will,</HI> but if you
please to leave it to me; I shall either get it for
you for less than that, or not be able to get it for
you at all: Then the losing Gentleman said to
one of the other, tell him, that if he can get it
lower, the Over-plus shall be to himself; <HI>William</HI>
said, he would be very glad to do the Gentleman
such a Service, and would leave the Reward to
himself. Well, young Man, says one of the
Gentlemen, what ever you appoint to the young
Artist that has done this Roguery; for I warrant
he is an Artist, let it be who it will, he shall be
paid, if it be within the Hundred Pound, and the
Gentleman is willing to give you 50 <HI>l.</HI> besides for
your Pains</P>
<P>TRULY, Sir, says <HI>Will,</HI> very Gravely, it was
by meer Chance; that coming by the Door, and
seeing the Crowd, I ask'd what the matter was;
but if I should be Instrumental to get the unfor∣tunate
Gentleman his Pocket-book, and the things
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
in it again, I shall be very glad; nor am I so Rich
neither Sir, but 50 <HI>l.</HI> is very well worth my while
too: Then he took Directions who to come to, and
where, and who to give his Account to, if he learnt
any thing, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> staid so long, that as he and I agreed, I
went home, and he did not come to me till Night;
for we had Consider'd before, that it would not be
proper to come from them directly to me, least
they should follow him, and apprehend me; if he
had made no advances towards a Treaty, he would
have come back in half an Hour, as we agreed;
but staying late, we met at our Night-rendezvous,
which was in <HI>Rosemary-lane.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he came, he gave me an Account of all
the Discourse, and particularly what a Consterna∣tion
the Gentleman was in, who had lost the
Pocket-book, and that he did not doubt, but we
should get a good round Sum for the Recovery
of it.</P>
<P>WE Consulted all the Evening about it, and
Concluded he should let them hear nothing of
them the next Day at all; and that the third Day
he should go, but should make no Discovery;
only that he had got a Scent of it, and that he be∣liev'd
he should have it, and make it appear as
Difficult as possible, and to start as many Obje∣ctions
as he could; accordingly, the third Day
after, he met with the Gentleman, who he found
had been uneasie, at his long stay; and told him,
they was asraid that he only Flatter'd them, to
get from them; and that they had been too Easie
in letting him go, without a farther Examination.</P>
<P>HE took upon him to be very Grave with them,
and told them, that if that was what he was like
to have for being so free, as to tell them he
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
thought he might serve them, they might see
that they had wrong'd him, and were mistaken
by his coming again to them; that if they thought
they cou'd do any thing by Examining him,
they might go about it if they pleas'd now, that
all he had to say to them, was, that he knew
where some of the young Rogues Haunted, who
were Famous for such things; and that by some
Inquiries, offering them Money and the like,
he believ'd they would be brought to betray one
another, and that so he might pick it out for them,
and this he would say before a Justice of Peace if
they thought fit, and then all that he had to say far∣ther
to them, was to tell them, he had lost a Day
or two in their Service; and had got nothing but
to be suspected for his Pains; and that after that,
he had done, and they might seek their Goods
where they could find them.</P>
<P>THEY began to lissen a little upon that, and
ask'd him if he could give them any Hopes of re∣covering
their Loss; he told them, that he was
not afraid to tell them, that he believ'd he had
heard some News of them, and that what he had
done, had prevented all the Bills being Burnt
Book and all; But that now he ought not to be
ask'd any more Questions till they should be
pleas'd to answer him a Question or two: They
told him they would give him any Satisfaction
they could, and bid him tell them what he de∣sir'd.</P>
<P>WHY,
Sir, <HI>Says he,</HI> how can you expect any
Thief that had Robb'd you to such a Considerable
Value as this, wou'd come and put himself into
your Hands, confess he had your Goods, and re∣store
them to you; if you do not give them Assu∣rance,
that you will not only give them the Re∣ward
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
you agree to, but also, give Assurance that
they shall not be Stop'd, Question'd, or call'd to
Account before a Magistrate.</P>
<P>THEY said they would give all possible Assu∣rance
of it; nay, <HI>says he,</HI> I do not know what As∣surance
you are able to give; for when a poor
Fellow is in your Clutches, and has shown you
your Goods, you may Seize upon him for a Theif,
and it is plain he must be so; then you go take
away your Goods, send him to Prison, and what
amends can he have of you afterward?</P>
<P>THEY were entirely confounded with the dif∣ficulty,
they ask'd him to try if he could get the
Things into his Hands, and they would pay him
the Money before he let them go out of his Hand,
and he should go away Half an Hour before
they went out of the Room.</P>
<P>No Gentlemen, <HI>says he,</HI> that won't do now;
if you had talk'd so before, you had talk'd of ap∣prehending
me for nothing, I should have taken
your Words; but now it is plain you have had
such a thought in your Heads, and how can I, or
any one else be assur'd of Safety.</P>
<P>WELL, they thought of a great many particu∣lars,
but nothing would do; at length the other
People who were present, put in, that they should
give Security to him, by a Bond of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> that
they would not give the Person any Trouble
whatsoever: He pretended they could not be
Bound, nor could their Obligation be of any Va∣lue,
and that their own Goods being once seen,
they might Seize them; and what would it signi∣fy,
<HI>said he,</HI> to put a poor Pick-pocket to Sue for
his Reward: They could not tell what to say, but
told him, that he should take the things of the
Boy, if it was a Boy; and they would be Bound
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
to Pay him the Money promis'd. He Laught at
them, and said, no Gentlemen, as I am not the
Thief; so I shall be very loth to put my self in
the Thiefs stead, and lye at your Mercy.</P>
<P>THEY told him they knew not what to do then;
and that it would be very hard, he would not
trust them at all; <HI>he said,</HI> he was very willing to
trust them, and to serve them; but that it would
be very hard to be ruin'd, and Charg'd with the
Theft, for Endeavouring to serve them.</P>
<P>THEY then offer'd to give it him under their
Hands, that they did not in the least Suspect him;
that they would never Charge him with any
thing about it; that they Acknowledg'd he went
about to Enquire after the Goods at their Request;
and that if he produced them, they would Pay
him so much Money, at, and before the Delivery
of them, without Obliging him to Name or pro∣duce
that Person he had them from.</P>
<P>UPON this Writing Sign'd by three Gentlemen
who were Present, and by the Person in particu∣lar
who lost the things; the young Gentleman
told them, he would go and do his utmost to get
the Pocket-book, and all that was in it.</P>
<P>THEN he desir'd that they would in Writing
before Hand, give him a particular of all the
several things that were in the Book; that he
might not have it said when he produc'd it,
that there was not all; and he would have the
said Writing Seal'd up, and he would make the
Book be Seal'd up when it was given to him:
This they agreed to, and the Gentleman accord∣ingly
drew up a particular of all the Bills that
he remembred, <HI>as he said,</HI> was in the Book; and
also of the <HI>Diamonds,</HI> as follows:
<Q><LIST>
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
<ITEM>One Bill under Sir <HI>Henry Furness</HI>'s
Hand, for 1200 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill under Sir <HI>Charles Dun∣comb</HI>'s
Hand, for 800 <HI>l. 250 l.</HI>
Endorst off 550</ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill under the Hand of
<HI>J. Tassell,</HI> Goldsmith 165</ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill of Sir <HI>Francis Child,</HI> 39</ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill of one <HI>Stewart</HI> that kept
a <HI>Wager Office,</HI> and <HI>Insurance.</HI> 350</ITEM>
<ITEM>A Paper containing 37 loose <HI>Diamonds,</HI> value
about 250 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>A little Paper containing three large Rough
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> and one large one, polish'd, and
Cut, Value 185 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>FOR all these things, they promiss'd first to give
me what ever he agreed with the Thief to give
him; not exceeding 50 <HI>l.</HI> and to give him 50 <HI>l.</HI>
more for himself for procuring them.</P>
<P>Now he had his Cue, and now he came to me,
and told me honestly the whole Story, as above;
so I deliver'd him the Book, and he told me that
he thought it was reasonable we should not take
the full Sum; because, he would seem to have
done them some Service, and so make them the
easier; all this I agreed to, so he went the next
Day to the place, and the Gentlemen met him
very punctually.</P>
<P>HE told them at first Word, he had done their
Work, and as he hoped to their Mind; and told
them, if it had not been for the <HI>Diamonds,</HI> he
could have got it all for 10 <HI>l;</HI> but that the <HI>Dia∣monds</HI>
had shone so Bright in the Boy's Imagina∣tion,
that he talk'd of running away to <HI>France</HI> or

<HI>Holland,</HI> and living there all his Days like a Gen∣tleman;
at which they Laught: However, Gen∣tlemen,
<HI>said he,</HI> here is the Book, and so pull'd
it out wrapt up in a Dirty peice of a Colour'd
Handkerchief, as black as the Street could make
it; and Seal'd with a peice of sorry Wax, and the
Impression of a Farthing for a Seal.</P>
<P>UPON this, the Note being also unseal'd; at
the same time he pull'd open the Dirty Rag,
and shew'd the Gentleman his Pocket-Book; at
which he was so over surpriz'd with Joy; notwith∣standing,
all the preparatory Discourse that he
was fain to call for a Glass of Wine or Brandy,
to Drink to keep him from Fainting.</P>
<P>THE Book being open'd, the Paper of <HI>Dia∣monds</HI>
was first taken out; and there they were
every one, only the little Paper was by itself;
and the Rough <HI>Diamonds</HI> that were in it, were
loose among the rest; but he own'd they were all
there Safe.</P>
<P>THEN the Bills were call'd over, one by one,
and they found one Bill for 80 Pound more than
the Account mention'd; besides, several Papers
which were not for Money, tho' of Consequence
to the Gentleman; and he acknowledg'd that all
was very honestly return'd, and now young Man,
<HI>said they,</HI> you shall see we will deal as honestly
by you; and so in the first place, they gave him
50<HI>l.</HI> for himself; and then they told out the 50<HI>l.</HI>
for me.</P>
<P>HE took the 50<HI>l.</HI> for himself, and put it up in
his Pocket; wrapping it in Paper, it being all in
Gold: Then he began to tell over the other 50<HI>l.</HI>
but when he had told out 30<HI>l.</HI> Hold Gentlemen,
<HI>said he,</HI> as I have acted fairly for you; so you
shall have no reason to say, I do not do so to the
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
End; I have taken 30<HI>l.</HI> and for so much I agreed
with the Boy, and so there is 20<HI>l.</HI> of your Money
again.</P>
<P>THEY stood looking one at another a good
while, as surpriz'd at the honesty of it, for till
that time they were not quite without a secret Sus∣picion
that he was the Thief, but that peice of Po∣licy
cleared up his Reputation to them: The
Gentleman that had got his Bills, said softly to
one of them, give it him all, but the other said
(softly too,) no, no, as long as he has got it abated,
and is satisfied with the 50 <HI>l.</HI> you have given him,
'tis very well, let it go as it is; this was not
spoke so softly but I heard it, and <HI>I said no too,</HI> I
am very well satisfied, I am glad I have got them
for you, and so they began to part.</P>
<P>BUT just before they were going away, one of
the Gentlemen said to him, young Man come,
you see we are just to you, and have done fairly,
as you have also, and we will not desire you to
tell us who this cunning Fellow is that got such a
Prize from this Gentleman; but as you have
talk'd with him, prethee can you tell us nothing
of how he did it, that we may beware of such
Sparks again.</P>
<P>SIR, says <HI>Will,</HI> when I shall tell you what they
say, and how the particular Case stood, the Gen∣tleman
would blame himself more than any Body
else, or as much at least; The young Rogue that
catch'd this Prize, was out it seems with a Com∣rade,
who is a nimble experienced Pick-pocket
as most in <HI>London,</HI> but at that time the Artist
was some where at a distance, and this Boy never
had pick'd a Pocket in his Life before; but <HI>he says,</HI>
he stood over against the Passage into the <HI>Ex∣change,</HI>
on the East-Side, and the Gentleman stood
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
just by the Passage; that he was very earnest in
Talking with some other Gentleman, and often
pull'd out this Book, and open'd it, and took Papers
out, or put others in, and return'd it into his Coat-Pocket;
that the last time it hitch'd at the Pocket∣hole,
or stop'd at something that was in the Pocket,
and hung a little out, which the Boy, who had
watch'd it a good while, perceiving, he passes by
close to the Gentleman, and carry'd it smoothly
off, without the Gentleman's perceiving it at all.</P>
<P>HE went on, <HI>and said,</HI> 'tis very strange Gen∣tlemen
should put Pocket-Books which have such
things in them into those loose Pockets, and in so
careless a manner; that's very true, <HI>says the Gen∣tleman,</HI>
and so with some other Discourse of no
great signification he came away to me.</P>
<P>WE were now so rich that we scarce knew what
to do with our Money, at least I did not, for I
had no Relations, no Friend, no where to put
any thing I had, but in my Pocket; as for <HI>Will,</HI>
he had a poor Mother, but wicked as himself,
and he made her Rich, and Glad with his good
Success.</P>
<P>WE divided this Booty equally, for tho' the
gaining it, was Mine, yet the improving it
was his, and his Management brought the Money;
for neither he, or I could have made any thing
proportionable of the thing, any other way; as
for the Bills, there was no room to doubt, but un∣less
they had been carried that Minute to the
Goldsmiths for the Money, he would have come
with Notice to stop the Payment, and perhaps
have come while the Money was Receiving, and
have taken hold of the Person; and then as to the
Diamonds there had been no offering them to Sale,
by us poor Boys to any Body, but those who were
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
our known Receivers, and they would have gi∣ven
us nothing for them, compar'd to what they
were worth; for as I understood afterwards, those
who made a Trade thus of buying stolen Goods,
took care to have false Weights and Cheat the
poor Devil that stole them, at least an Ounce in
Three.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we made the best of it, many
ways besides; I had a strange kind of uninstructed
Conscience at that Time; for tho' I made no scruple
of getting any thing in this manner from any
Body, yet I could not bear destroying their
Bills, and Papers, which were things that would
do them a great deal of hurt, and do me no good;
and I was so Tormented about it, that I could not
rest Night or Day, while I made the People ea∣sie,
from whom the things were taken.</P>
<P>I WAS now rich, so rich that I knew not what
to do with my Money, or with myself, I had
liv'd so near and so close, that altho' as <HI>I said,</HI> I
did now and then lay out Two-pence, or Three-pence
for meer Hunger, yet I had so many Peo∣ple,
who, <HI>as I said,</HI> employ'd me, and who gave
me Victuals, and sometimes Clothes, that in a
whole Year I had not quite Spent the 15 Shil∣lings,
which I had sav'd of the Custom House
Gentleman's Money, and I had the 4 Guineas,
which was of the first Booty before that, still in
my Pocket, I mean the Money that I let fall in∣to
the Tree.</P>
<P>BUT now I began to look higher, and tho'
<HI>Will</HI> and I, went Abroad several times together,
yet when small things offer'd, as Handkerchiefs,
and such Trifies, we would not meddle with
them, not ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to run the Risque for small
Matters: It fell out one Day that as we were
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
strouling about in <HI>West-Smithfield,</HI> on a <HI>Friday,</HI>
there happen'd to be an antient Country Gentle∣man
in the Market, selling some very large Bul∣locks;
it seems they came out of <HI>Sussex,</HI> for we
heard him say there were no such Bullocks in the
whole County of <HI>Sussex;</HI> his Worship, <HI>for so they
calll'd him,</HI> had receiv'd the Money for these Bul∣locks
at a Tavern, whose Sign, I forget now, and
havi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g some of it in a Bag, and the Bag in his
Hand, he was taken with a sudden fit of Cough∣ing,
and stands to Cough, resting his Hand with
the Bag of Money in it, upon a Bulk-head of a
Shop, just by the <HI>Cloyster-Gate</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,
that is to say,</HI> within three or four Doors of it;
we were both just behind him, says <HI>Will</HI> to me,
stand ready; upon this, he makes an artificial
stumble, and falls with his Head just against the
old Gentleman in the very Moment, when he
was Coughing ready to be strangl'd, and quite
Spent for want of Breath.</P>
<P>THE violence of the blow beat the old Gentle∣man
quite down, the Bag of Money did not im∣mediately
fly out of his Hand, but I run to get
hold of it, and gave it a quick snatch, pul∣led
it clean away, and run like the Wind down
the <HI>Cloyster</HI> with it, turn'd on the Left-Hand as
soon as I was thro', and cut into <HI>Little-Britain</HI> so
into <HI>Bartholomew-Close,</HI> then cross <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI>
thro' <HI>Paul's-Alley</HI> into <HI>Red-Cross-street,</HI> and so cress
all the Streets, thro' innumerable Alleys, and
never stopp'd, till I got into the second Quarter
of <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> our old agreed Rendezvous.</P>
<P>WILL, in the mean time fell down with the old
Gentleman, but soon got up; the old Knight,
<HI>for such it seems he was,</HI> was frighted with the fall,
and-this Breath so stopp'd with his Cough, that
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
he could not recover himself to speak till some
time, during which, nimble <HI>Will</HI> was got up again,
and walk'd off; nor could he call out stop Thief,
or tell any Body he had lost any thing for a good
while; but Coughing vehemently, and looking
red till he was almost black in the Face, he cry'd
the Ro—<HI>Hegh, Hegh, Hegh,</HI> the Rogues <HI>Hegh,</HI>
have got <HI>Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh,</HI> then
he would get a little Breath, and at it again the
Rogue—<HI>Hegh, Hegh,</HI> and after a great many
<HI>Heghs,</HI> and <HI>Rogues</HI> he brought it out, have got a∣way
my Bag of Money.</P>
<P>ALL this while the People understood nothing
of the matter, and as for the Rogues indeed, they
had time enough to get clear away, and in about
an Hour <HI>Will</HI> came to the Rendezvous; there we
sat down in the Grass again, and turn'd out the
the Money, which prov'd to be 8 Guineas, and
5<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> in Silver, so that it made just 14<HI>l.</HI> to∣gether;
this we shar'd upon the Spot, and went
to Work the same Day, for more; but whether
it was that being fluth'd with our Success, we
were not so vigilant, or that no other opportunity
offer'd, I know not, but we got nothing more that
Night, nor so much as any thing offer'd it self
for an attempt.</P>
<P>WE took many Walks of this kind, sometime
together, at a little distance from one another,
and several small Hits we made, but we were so
slush'd with our Success, that truly we were a∣bove
meddling with Trifles, <HI>as I said before,</HI> no,
not such things, that others would have been glad
of; nothing but Pocket-Books, Letter-Cases, or
Sums of Money would move us.</P>
<P>THE next Adventure was in the dusk of the
Evening in a Court, which goes out of <HI>Grace-Church-street</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
into <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> where the <HI>Qua∣ker's-Meeting
House</HI> is; there was a young Fellow,
who as we learn'd afterward was a Wollen-Drapers
Apprentice in <HI>Grace Church street;</HI> it seems he had
been receiving a Sum of Money, which was very
considerable, and he comes to a Goldsmith's-Shop
in <HI>Lombard Street</HI> with it; paid in the most of
it there, insomuch, that it grew Dark, and the
Goldsmith began to be shutting in Shop, and
Candles to be Lighted: We watch'd him in there,
and stood on the other Side of the way to see what
he did When he had paid in all the Money he
intended, he stay'd still sometime longer to take
Notes, as I suppos'd, for what he had paid, and
by this time it was still darker than before; at
last he comes out of the Shop, with still a pretty
large Bag under his Arm, and walks over into
the Court, which was then very Dark; in the mid∣dle
of the Court is, a boarded Entry, and far∣ther,
at the End of it a Threshold, and as soon
as he had set his Foot over the Threshold he was
to turn on his Left Hand into <HI>Grace-Church-street.</HI></P>
<P>KEEPUP,
says <HI>Will</HI> to me, be nimble, and as soon
as he had said so, he flyes at the young Man, and
Gives him such a violent Thrust, that push'd him
forward with too great a force for him to stand,
and as he strove to recover, the Threshold took
his Feet, and he fell forward into the other part
of the Court, as if he had flown in the Air, with
his Head lying towards the <HI>Quaker's-Meeting-House;</HI>
I stood ready, and presently felt out the
Bag of Money, which I heard fall, for it flew
out of his Hand, he having his Life to save, not
his Money: I went forward with the Money,
and <HI>Will</HI> that threw him down, finding I had it,
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
run backward, and as I made along <HI>Fen-Church-street,
Will</HI> overtook me, and we scour'd home
together; the poor young Man was hurt a little
with the fall, and reported to his Master, as we
heard afterward that he was knock'd down, which
was not true, for neither <HI>Will,</HI> or I had any
Stick in our Hands; but the Master of the Youth
was it seems so very thankful that his young
Man was not knock'd down before he paid the
rest of the Money, (which was above 100 <HI>l.</HI> more)
to the Goldsmith, who was Sir, <HI>John Sweetapple,</HI>
that he made no great Noise at the Loss he
had; and as we heard afterward, only warn'd
his Prentice to be more careful, and come no
more thro' such Places in the Dark; whereas the
Man had really no such Deliverance as he ima∣gined,
for we saw him before, when he had all
the Money about him, but it was no time of Day
for such Work as we had to do, so that he was
in no Danger before.</P>
<P>THIS Booty mounted to 29 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> which was 14 <HI>l.</HI>
18 <HI>s.</HI> a peice, and added exceedingly to my Store,
which began now to be very much too big for
my Management; and indeed I began to be now
full of Care for the preservation of what I had
got: I wanted a trusty Friend to commit it to,
but where was such a one to be found by a poor
Boy, bred up among Thieves? if I should have
let any honest Body know that I had so much
Money, they would have ask'd me how I came by
it, and would have been afraid to take it into
their Hands, least I being some time or other
catch'd in my Rogueries, they should be counted
the Receivers of stolen Goods, and the encouragers
of a Thief.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80"/>
WE had however in the mean time a great ma∣ny
other successful Enterprizes, some of one
kind, some of another, and were never so much
as in danger of being apprehended; but my Com∣panion
<HI>Will,</HI> who was now grown a Man, and en∣courag'd
by these Advantages fell into quite
another Vein of Wickedness, getting acquainted
with a wretched Gang of Fellows, that turn'd
their Hands to every Thing that was vile.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> was a lusty strong Fellow, and withal ve∣ry
bold and daring, would Fight any Body, and
venture upon any thing, and I found he began
to be above the mean Rank of a poor Pick-pocket,
so I saw him but seldom; however, once coming
to me in a very friendly familiar Manner, and
asking me how I went on, I told him that I us'd
the old Trade still, that I had had two or three
good Jobbs, one with a young Woman, whose
Pocket I had pick'd of eleven Guineas, and ano∣ther
a Country Woman just come out of a Stage-Coach,
seeing her pull out her Bag to pay the
Coachman, and that I follow'd her till I got an
opportunity, and slipt it out so neatly, that tho'
there was 8 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> in it, yet she never felt it go;
and several other Jobbs I told him off, by which
I made pretty good Purchase: I always said you
were a lucky Boy, Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> but come
you are grown almost a Man now, and you shall
not be always at play at Push-pin, I am got in∣to
better Business I assure you, and you shall
come into it too, I'll bring you into a brave Gang
<HI>Jack, says he,</HI> where you shall see we shall be all
Gentlemen.</P>
<P>THEN he told me the Trade it self in short,
which was with a Set of Fellows, that had
two of the most desperate Works upon their
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
Hands that belong'd to the whole Art of Thieving;
<HI>that is to say,</HI> in the Evening they were Foot-pads,
and in the Night they were House-breakers: <HI>Will</HI>
told me so many plausible Stories, and talk'd of
such great things, that in short, I who had been
always us'd to do any thing he bid me do, went
with him without any hesitation.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that hitherto
being partly from the gross Ignorance of my un∣taught
Childhood, as I observ'd before, partly
from the hardness, and wickedness of the Com∣pany
I kept, and add to these, that it was the
Business I might be said to be brought up to, I had,
<HI>I say,</HI> all the way hitherto, no manner of thoughts
about the Good or Evil of what I was embark'd in;
consequently, I had no Sense of Conscience, no
Reproaches upon my Mind for having done
amiss.</P>
<P>YET I had something in me, by what secret In∣fluence
I knew not, kept me from the other degrees
of Raking and Vice, and in short, from the ge∣neral
Wickedness of the rest of my Companions:
For Example, I never us'd any ill Words, no
Body ever heard me swear, nor was I given to
drink, or to love strong drink; and I cannot omit a
Circumstance that very much serv'd to prevent it;
I had a strange original Notion, as I have menti∣oned
in its Place, of my being a Gentleman; and
several things had Casually happen'd in my way
to encrease this Fancy of mine; it happen'd one
Day, that being in the <HI>Glass house</HI> Yard, between
<HI>Rosemary-lane</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff-high-way,</HI> there came
a Man dress'd very well, and with a Coach attend∣ing
him, and he came, (as I suppose) to buy Glass-bottles,
or some other Goods, as they sold; and
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
in bargaining for his Goods, he swore most hor∣rid
Oaths at every two or three Words.</P>
<P>AT length the Master of the Glass, an anti∣ent
grave Gentleman took the liberty to reprove
him, which at first made him swear the worse;
after a while the Gentleman was a little calmer, but
still he swore very much, tho' not so bad as at
first; after sometime, the Master of the <HI>Glass-house</HI>
turn'd from him; really Sir, <HI>says the good
old Gentleman,</HI> you swear so, and take God's
Name in vain so, that I cannot bear to stay with
you, I had rather you would let my Goods alone,
and go some where else, I hope you won't take
it Ill, but I don't desire to deal with any Body
that does so, I am afraid my <HI>Glass-House</HI> should
fall on your Head while you stay in it.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman grew good humour'd at the
Reproof, and said, well come don't go away, I
won't swear any more, <HI>says he,</HI> if I can help it,
for I own, <HI>say he,</HI> I should not do it.</P>
<P>WITH that the old Gentleman look'd up at
him, and returning, really Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> 'tis pity
you that seem to be a fine Gentleman, well Bred
and good Humour'd, should accustom your self
to such an hateful Practice; why it is not like a
Gentleman to swear, 'tis enough for my black
Wretches that Work there at the Furnace, or for
these ragged nak'd black Guard Boys, pointing at
me, and some others of the dirty Crew that
lay in the Ashes; 'tis bad enough for them, <HI>says
he,</HI> and they ought to be corrected for it too;
but for a Man of Breeding, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> a Gentle∣man!
it ought to be look'd upon as below them;
Gentlemen know better, and are taught better,
and it is plain you know better; I beseech you
Sir, when you are tempted to swear, always ask
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
your self, is this like a Gentleman? does this be∣come
me as a Gentleman! do but ask your self
that Question, and your Reason will prevail, you
will soon leave it off.</P>
<P>I HEARD all this, and it made the Blood run
Chill in my Veins, when he said Swearing was on∣ly
fit for such as we were; in short, it made as
great an Impression upon me, as it did upon the
Gentleman; <HI>and yet he took it very kindly too, and
thank'd the old Gentleman for his Advice.</HI> But from
that time forward I never had the least Inclinati∣on
to Swearing, or ill Words, and abhored it when
I heard the other Boys do it; as to Drinking,
I had no Opportunity, for I had nothing to Drink,
but Water or small Beer, that any body gave me in
Charity, for they soldom gave away strong Beer;
and after I had Money, I neither desir'd strong
Beer, or car'd to part with my Money to Buy it.</P>
<P>THEN as to Principle, 'tis true I had no Foun∣dation
lay'd in me by Education; and being early
led by my fate into Evil, I had the less Sense of
its being Evil left upon my Mind: But when I
began to grow to an Age of understanding, and
to know that I was a Thief, growing up in all
manner of Villany, and ripening a-pace for the
Gallows, it came often into my thoughts that I
was going wrong, that I was in the high Road to
the Devil, and several times would stop short,
and ask my self, if this was the Life of a Gentle∣man?</P>
<P>BUT these little things wore off again, as often
as they came on, and I follow'd the old Trade
again; especially when <HI>Will</HI> came to prompt me
as I have observ'd, for he was a kind of a Guide
to me in all these things, and I had by Custom
and Application, together with seeing his way,
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
learnt to be as a cute a Workman as my Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>BUT to go back where I left off, <HI>Will</HI> came to
me as I have said, and telling me how much better
Business he was fallen into, would have me go a∣long
with him, and I should be a Gentleman:
<HI>Will</HI> it seems understood that Word in a quite dif∣fering
manner from me; for his Gentleman was
nothing more or less than a Gentleman Thief, a
Villain of a higher Degree than a Pick-pocket;
and one that might do something more Wicked,
and better Entituling him to the Gallows, than
could be done in our way: But my Gentleman
that I had my Eye upon, was another thing quite,
tho' I cou'd not really tell how to describe it
neither.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Word took with me, and I went
with him; we were neither of us Old, <HI>Will</HI>
was about 24, and as for me I was now about 18,
and pretty Tall of my Age.</P>
<P>THE first time I went with him, he brought me
into the Company only of two more young Fel∣lows;
we met at the lower part of <HI>Grays-Inn-Lane,</HI>
about an Hour before Sun-set, and went out
into the Fields toward a place call'd <HI>Pindar of
Wakefield,</HI> where are abundance of Brick-Kilns:
Here it was agreed to spread from the Field Path
to the Road way, all the way towards <HI>Pancrass
Church,</HI> to observe any Chance Game, which as
they call'd it, they might shoot Flying: Upon the
Path within the Bank, on the side of the Road go∣ing
towards <HI>Kentish Town,</HI> two of our Gang, <HI>Will,</HI>
and one of the other, met a single Gentleman
walking a-pace towards the Town, being almost
Dark: <HI>Will</HI> Cryed, <HI>Mark ho,</HI> which it seems was
the Word, at which we were all to stand still at a
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
distance, come in if he wanted help, and give a
Signal if any thing appear'd that was Dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> steps up to the Gentleman, stops him, and
put the Question, that is, <HI>Sir, your Money?</HI> the
Gentleman seeing he was alone, struck at him
with his Cane, but <HI>Will</HI> a Nimble strong Fellow
flew in upon him, and with Struggling, got him
down, then he begg'd for his Life, <HI>Will</HI> having
told him with an Oath, that he would Cut his
Throat: In that Moment, while this was doing,
comes a Hackney Coach along the Road; and the
fourth Man who was that way, Crys, <HI>Mark ho,</HI>
which was to intimate that it was a Prize, not a
Surprize, and accordingly the next Man went up
to assist him, where they stop'd the Coach, which
had a Doctor of Physick and a Surgeon in it, who
had been to Visit some considerable Patient; and
I suppose had had considerable Fees; for here they
got two good Purses, one with 11 or 12 Guineas,
the other Six, with some Pocket Money, two
Watches, one Diamond Ring, and the Surgeons
Plaister-box, which was most of it full of Silver
Instruments.</P>
<P>WHILE they were at this Work, <HI>Will</HI> kept the
Man down, who was under him; and tho' he pro∣mis'd
not to Kill him unless he offer'd to make a
Noise, yet he would not let him stir till he heard
the Noise of the Coach going on again, by which
he knew the jobb was over on that Side: Then he
Carried him a little out of the way, ty'd his
Hands behind him, and bid him lye still and make
no Noise, and he would come back in half an
Hour and untie him upon his Word, but if he
Cryed out he would come back and Kill him.</P>
<P>THE poor Man promis'd to lye still and make
no Noise, and did so; and had not above 11 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
in his Pocket, which <HI>Will</HI> took, and came back to
the rest, but while they were together, I who was
on the Side of the <HI>Pindar</HI> of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> cry'd
<HI>Mark ho,</HI> too.</P>
<P>WHAT I saw, was a Couple of poor Women, one
a kind of a Nurse, and the other a Maid-Servant
going for <HI>Kentish-Town:</HI> As <HI>Will</HI> knew that I was
but young at the work, he came flying to me, and
seeing how easie a Bargain it was, <HI>he said,</HI> go
<HI>Col.</HI> fall to Work; I went up to them, and speak∣ing
to the elderly Woman, Nurse, <HI>said I,</HI> don't
be in such hast, I want to speak with you, at
which they both stopp'd, and look'd a little
frighted; don't be frighted Sweetheart, <HI>said I,</HI> to
the Maid, a little of that Money in the bottom
of your Pocket will make all easie, and I'll do you
no harm; by this time <HI>Will</HI> came up to us, for they
did not see him before; then they began to scream
out; hold, <HI>says I,</HI> make no Noise, unless you have a
mind to force us to murther you whether we will
or no, give me your Money presently, and make
no Words, and we shan't hurt you; upon this, the
poor Maid pull'd out 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and the old Woman
a Guinea, and a Shilling, crying heartily for her
Money, and said, it was all she had left in the
World; well we took it for all that, tho' it made
my very heart bleed to see what agony the poor
Woman was in at parting with it, and I ask'd her
where she liv'd, she said her Name was <HI>Smith,</HI> and
she liv'd at <HI>Kentish-Town;</HI> I said nothing to her,
but bid them go on about their Business, and I
gave <HI>Will</HI> the Money; so in a few Minutes we
were all together again: Says one of the other
Rogues, come, this is well enough, for one Road;
its time to be gone; so we jog'd away, crossing the
Fields, out of the Path towards <HI>Tottenham-Court;</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
but hold, <HI>says Will,</HI> I must go and untye the Man,
D—m him, <HI>says one of them,</HI> let him lye, no <HI>says
Will,</HI> I won't be worse than my Word, I will untye
him; so he went to the Place, but the Man was
gone, either he had untyed himself, or some Body
had pass'd by, and he had call'd for help, and so
was unty'd, for he could not find him, nor make
him hear, tho' he ventur'd to call twice for him
aloud.</P>
<P>THIS made us hasten away the faster, and get∣ting
into <HI>Tottenham Court</HI> Road, they thought it was
a little too near, so they made into the Town at
St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and crossing to <HI>Pickadilly,</HI> went to <HI>High-Park-Gate;</HI>
here they ventured to rob another
Coach; <HI>that is to say,</HI> one of the two other Rogues,
and <HI>Will</HI> did it between the <HI>Park Gate</HI> and <HI>Knight's-bridge;</HI>
there was in it, only a Gentleman and
a Punk; a Whore that he had pick'd up, it
seems at the <HI>Spring-Garden</HI> a little farther;
they took the Gentleman's Money, and his Watch,
and his Silver hilted Sword; but when they come
to the Slut, she Damn'd them, and curs'd them
for robbing the Gentleman of his Money, and
leaving him none for her; as for her self, she had
not one Six-penny Peice about her, tho' she was
indeed well enough dress'd too.</P>
<P>HAVING made this Adventure, we left that
Road too, and went over the Fields to <HI>Chelsea;</HI> in
the way from <HI>Westminster</HI> to <HI>Chelsea,</HI> we met three
Gentlemen; but they were too strong for us to
meddle with; they had been afraid to come over
the Fields so late, (for by this time it was Eight
a-Clock, and tho' the Moon gave some Light, yet
it was too late, and too dark to be Safe,) so they
hired three Men at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> two with Pitch-Forks,
and the third, a Waterman, with a Boat-Hook-Staff
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
to Guard them, we would have Steer'd clear of
them, and car'd not to have them see us if we could
help it, but they did see us, and cry'd, <HI>Who comes
there?</HI> we answer'd Friends, and so they went on
to our great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Chelsea,</HI> it seems we had other
Work to do, which I had not been made privy
to, and this was a House to be robb'd; they had
some Intelligence it seems with a Servant in the
House, who was of their Gang; this Rogue was
a Waiting-man, or Foot-man, and he had a Watch
word to let them in by; but this Fellow not for
want of being a Villain, but by getting drunk,
and not minding his part of the Work disappoint∣ed
us, for he had Promis'd to rise at Two a-Clock
in the Morning, and let us all in; but be∣ing
very Drunk, and not come in at Eleven a-Clock
his Master order'd him to be shut out, and
the Doors lock'd up, and charg'd the other
Servants not to let him in, upon any Terms what∣soever.</P>
<P>WE came about the House at One a-Clock to
make our Observations, intending to go and lye un∣der
<HI>Beaufort-House</HI> Wall till the Clock struck Two,
and then to come again; but behold! when we came
to the House, there lay the Fellow at the Door
fast a-sleep, and very Drunk: <HI>Will,</HI> who I found
was the Leader in all these things, wak'd the
Fellow, who as he had had about two Hours
Sleep was a little come to himself, and told them
the Misfortune, as he call'd it, and that he could
not get in; they had some Instruments about them,
by which they could have broken in by Force,
but <HI>Will</HI> consider'd, that as it was but waiting till
another time, and they should be let in quietly,
they resolv'd to give it over for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89"/>
BUT this was a happy Drunken-bout for the
Family, for the Fellow having let fall some
Words in his Drink, for he was a Saucy one, as
well as a Drunken one, and talk'd oddly, as that
it had been better they had let him in, and he
would make them pay dear for it, or some such
thing; the Master hearing of it, turn'd him a∣way
in the Morning, and never let him come in∣to
his House again; <HI>so I say,</HI> it was a happy
Drunkenness to the Family, for it sav'd them
from being robb'd, and perhaps murther'd, for
they were a cursed bloody Crew, and as I found
were about Thirteen of them in all, whereof three
of them made it their Business to get into Gen∣tlemens
Services, and so to open Doors in the
Night, and let the other Rogues in upon them,
to rob and destroy them.</P>
<P>I rambl'd this whole Night with them, they
went from <HI>Chelsea,</HI> being disappointed there as
above, to <HI>Kensington;</HI> there they broke into a Brew-house,
and Wash-house, and by that means into
an Out-Kitchen of a Gentleman's-House, where
they unhang'd a small Copper, and brought it off,
and stole about a Hundred weight of Pewter, and
went clear off with that too, and every one going
their own by-ways, they found means to get safe
to their several Receptacles where they used to
dispose of such things.</P>
<P>WE lay still the next Day, and shar'd the
Effects stolen that Night, of which my Share
came to 8 <HI>l.</HI> 19 <HI>s.</HI> the Copper and Pewter being
weigh'd, and cast up, a Person was at hand to
take it as Money, at about half Value, and in the
Afternoon, <HI>Will</HI> and I came away together: <HI>Will</HI>
was mighty full of the Success we had had, and
how we might be sure of the like this way every
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
Day. But he observ'd that I did not seem so eleva∣ted
at the Success of that Night's Ramble as I us'd to
be, and also that I did not take any great Notice
of the Expectations he was in, of what was to
come, yet I had said little to him at that time.</P>
<P>BUT my Heart was full of the poor Woman's
Case at <HI>Kentish</HI> Town, and I resolv'd, if possible to
find her out, and give her her Money: With the
abhorrence that fill'd my Mind at the Cruelty
of that Act, there necessarily follow'd a little
Distaste of the thing it self, and now it came in∣to
my Head with a double force, that this was the
High Road to the Devil, and that certainly this
was not the Life of a Gentleman!</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> and I parted for that time, but next Morn∣ing
we met again, and <HI>Will</HI> was mighty Brisk and
Merry; and now Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> we shall be
Rich very quickly; well, <HI>says I,</HI> and what shall
we do, when we are Rich? do, <HI>says he,</HI> we will
buy a Couple of good Horses, and go farther a
Field; what do you mean by farther a Field, <HI>said
I?</HI> why, <HI>says he,</HI> we will take the Highway like
Gentlemen, and then we shall get a great deal of
Money indeed; well, <HI>says I,</HI> what then? why
then, <HI>says he,</HI> we shall live like Gentlemen.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Will, says I,</HI> if we get a great deal of
Money, shan't we leave this Trade off, and sit
down, and be Safe and Quiet?</P>
<P>AY, says <HI>Will,</HI> when we have got a great Estate
we shall be willing to lay it down; but where,
<HI>says I,</HI> shall we be before that time comes, if we
should drive on this cursed kind of Trade?</P>
<P>PRETHEE never think of that, <HI>says Will,</HI> if you
think of those things, you will never be fit to
be a Gentleman; he touch'd me there indeed, for
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
it run much in my Mind still, that I was to be
a Gentleman, and it made me Dumb for a while;
but I came to my self after a little while, and I
said to him, pretty Tartly, Why <HI>Will,</HI> do you
call this way of Living the Life of a Gentleman?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says, Will,</HI> why not?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says I,</HI> was it like a Gentleman for me
to take that Two and Twenty Shillings from a poor
antient Woman, when she beg'd of me upon her
Knees not to take it, and told me it was
all she had in the World to buy her Bread
for her self and a sick Child which she had at
home, do you think I could be so Cruel if you
had not stood by, and made me do it? why, I
cry'd at doing it, as much as the poor Woman
did, tho' I did not let you see me.</P>
<P>You Fool you, <HI>says Will,</HI> you will never be
fit for our Business indeed, if you mind such
things as those, I shall bring you off of those
things quickly; why, if you will be fit for Bu∣siness,
you must learn to fight when they resist,
and cut their Throats when they submit; you must
learn to stop their Breath, that they may beg and
pray no more; what signifies pity? prethee, who
will pity us when we come to the <HI>Old-Baily?</HI> I
warrant you that whining old Woman that beg'd
so heartily for her Two and Twenty Shillings would
let you, or I beg upon our Knees, and would not
save our Lives by not coming in for an Evidence
against us; did you ever see any of them cry when
they see Gentlemen go to the Gallows?</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>Will, says I,</HI> you had better let us keep
to the Business we were in before; there was no
such cruel doings in that, and yet we got more
Money by it, then I believe we shall get at this.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92"/>
No, no, says <HI>Will,</HI> you are a Fool, you don't know
what fine things we shall do in a little while.</P>
<P>UPON this Discourse we parted for that time,
but I resolv'd with my self, that I would never be
concern'd with him that Way any more; the
Truth is, they were such a dreadful Gang, such
horrid barbarous Villains, that even that little
while that I was among them, my very blood run
cold in my Veins at what I heard, particularly,
the continu'd Raving and Damning one another,
and themselves at every Word they spoke; and
then the horrid Resolutions of Murther, and
cutting Throats, which I perceiv'd was in their
Minds upon any Occasion that should present;
this appear'd first in their Discourse upon the
Disappointment they met with at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> where
the two Rogues that were with us, ay, and <HI>Will</HI>
too damn'd and rag'd, that they could not get
into the House, and swore they would have
cut the Gentleman's Throat, if they had got
in, and shook Hands, damning and cursing them∣selves,
if they did not murther the whole Fami∣ly,
as soon as <HI>Tom</HI> (that was the Man-Servant)
could get an Opportunity to let them in.</P>
<P>TWO Days after this, <HI>Will</HI> came to my Lodging,
for I had now got a Room by myself, had bought
me tollerably good Cloaths, and some Shirts, and
began to look like other Folks, but as it happen'd
I was Abroad upon the Scout another way; for
tho' I was not harden'd enough for so black a
Villain as <HI>Will</HI> would have had me be, yet I had
not arriv'd to any Principle sufficient to keep me
from a Life, in its degree wicked enough, which
tended to the same Destruction, tho' not in so vio∣lent
and precipitant Degrees: I had his Mes∣sage
deliver'd to me, which was to meet him the
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
next Evening, at <HI>such a Place,</HI> and I came in time
enough to meet, so I went to the Place, but re∣solv'd
before hand, that I would not go any more
with him among the Gang.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to my great Satisfaction I miss'd
him, for he did not come at all to the Place, but
met with the Gang at another Place, they having
sent for him in hast upon the Notice of some Booty,
and so they went all away together; this was a
Summons, it seems from one of the Creatures,
which they had Abroad in a Family, where an
Opportunity offer'd them to commit a notorious
Robbery, down almost as far as <HI>Hownstow,</HI> and
where they wounded a Gentleman's Gardiner so,
that I think he dyed, and robb'd the House of a
very considerable Sum of Money and Plate.</P>
<P>THIS however was not so clean carried, nor
did they get in so easie, but by the Resistance they
met with, the Neighbours were all arm'd, and the
Gentlemen Rogues were pursued, and being at
<HI>London</HI> with the Booty, one of them was taken;
<HI>Will,</HI> a dexterous Fellow, and Head of the Gang,
made his Escape, and tho' in his Cloths with a
great weight about him, of both Money and Plate,
plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI> and swam over where
there was no Path, or Road, leading to the Ri∣ver;
so that no Body suspected any ones going
that way; being got over, he made his way wet
as he was into some Woods adjacent, and as
he told me afterwards, not far from <HI>Chertsy,</HI> and
stay'd lurking about in the Woods, or Fields there
about, till his Cloaths were dry, then in the Night
got down to <HI>Kingstone,</HI> and so to <HI>Mortlack,</HI> where
he got a Boat to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HE knew nothing that one of his Comerades
was taken; only he knew that they were all so
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
closely pursued that they were oblig'd to disperse,
and every one to shift for himself: He hap∣pened
to come home in the Evening as good
luck then directed him, just after search had been
made for him by the Constables; his Companion,
who was taken, having upon promise of Favour,
and of saving him from the Gallows, discover'd his
Companions, and <HI>Will</HI> among the rest, as the
principal Party in the whole Undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> got notice of this just time enough to run
for it, and not to be taken, and away he came to
look for me; but as my good Fate still directed,
I was not at home neither; however, he left all his
Booty at my Lodging, and hid it in an old Coat,
that lay under my Bedding, and left Word that
my Brother <HI>Will</HI> had been there, and had left his
Coat that he borrow'd of me, and that it was un∣der
my Bed.</P>
<P>I KNEW not what to make of it, but went up
to go to Bed, and finding the Parcel, was perfect∣ly
frighted to see wrap'd up in it above a Hun∣dred
Pound in Plate, and Money, and yet knew
nothing of Brother <HI>Will, as he call'd himself,</HI> nor
did I hear of him in three or four Days.</P>
<P>AT the end of four Days, I heard by great Ac∣cident
that <HI>Will,</HI> who us'd to be seen with me,
and who call'd me Brother, was taken, and would
be hang'd: Next Day a poor Man a Shoemaker,
that us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d formerly to have a kindness for me, and
to send me of Errands, and give me sometimes
some Victuals, seeing me accidently in <HI>Rose∣mary
lane,</HI> going by him, clap'd me fast hold
by the Arm, hark ye young Man, <HI>says he?</HI> have I
catch'd you, and hal'd me a long as if I had been
a Thief apprehended, and he the Constable;
hark ye, <HI>Col.</HI> Jack, <HI>says he</HI> again, come a long
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
with me, I must speak with you: What are you
got into this Gang too? What are you turn'd
House-breaker? come I'll have you hang'd to be
sure.</P>
<P>THESE were dreadful Words to me, who tho'
not guilty of the particular thing in Question,
yet was frighted hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily before, and did not
know what I might be charg'd with by <HI>Will,</HI> if
he was taken, as I had heard that very Morning,
he was; with these Words, the Shoemaker began
to hale and drag me a long as he us'd to do when
I was a Boy.</P>
<P>HOWEVER recovering my Spirits, and provok∣ed
to the highest degree, I said to him again,
what do you mean Mr.—? let me alone, or
you will oblige me to make you do it, and with
that, I stop'd short, and soon let him see I was
grown a little too big to be hal'd about, as I us'd,
to be, when I run of his Errands, and made a Mo∣tion
with my other Hand as if I would strike him
in the Face.</P>
<P>How, <HI>Jack! says he,</HI> will you strike me? will
you strike your old Friend? and then he let go
my Arm, and Laugh'd; well, but hark ye <HI>Col.
says he,</HI> I am in earnest, I hear bad News of you;
they say you are gotten into bad Company, and
that this <HI>Will,</HI> calls you Brother; he is a great
Villain, and I hear he is Charg'd with a bloody
Robbery, and will be hang'd, if he is taken; I
hope you are not concern'd with him, if you are,
I would advise you to shift for your self, for the
Constable, and the Headborough are after him to
Day, and if he can lay any thing to you he will
do it you may be sure; he will certainly hang
you to save himself.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="96"/>
THIS was kind, and I thank'd him, but told
him, this was a thing too Serious, and that had too
much Weight in it to be jested with, as he had
done before; and that some Ignorant Stranger
might have seiz'd upon me, as a Person Guilty,
who had no farther Concern in it, than just know∣ing
the Man, and so I might have been brought
into Trouble for nothing; at least People might
have thought I was among them, whether I was
or no, and it would have rendred me suspected,
tho' I was Innocent.</P>
<P>HE acknowledg'd that, told me he was but in
jest, and that he talk'd to me just as he us'd to do:
However, Col. <HI>says he,</HI> I wont jest any more with
you, in a thing of such a dangerous Consequence;
I only advise you to keep the Fellow Company
no more.</P>
<P>I THANK'D him, and went away, but in the
greatest perplexity Imaginable; and now not
knowing what to do with my self, or with the lit∣tle
ill-gotten Wealth which I had; I went musing,
and alone into the Fields towards <HI>Stepney,</HI> my
usual Walk; and there began to consider what to
do, and as this Creature had left his Prize in my
Garret, I began to think, that if he should be ta∣ken
and should Confess, and send the Officers to
Search there for the Goods, and they should find
them, I should be undone, and should be taken up
for a Confederate; whereas, I knew nothing of
the matter, and had no Hand in it.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus musing, and in great Per∣plexity,
I heard some body Hallow to me; and
looking about, I saw <HI>Will</HI> running after me: I
knew not what to think at first; but seeing him
alone was the more Encouraged, and I stood still
for him; when he came up to me, I said to him,
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
What's the matter <HI>Will?</HI> matter, <HI>says Will,</HI> matter
enough, I am undone, when was you at Home?</P>
<P>I saw what you left there, <HI>says I,</HI> what is the
meaning of it, and where got you all that? is that
your being undone?</P>
<P>AY, <HI>says Will,</HI> I am undone for all that; for
the Officers are after me, and I am a Dead Dog if
I am taken, for <HI>George</HI> is in Custody, and he has
Peach'd me and all the other, to save his Life.
LIFE! <HI>says I,</HI> why, should you loose your Life,
if they should take you, pray what would they
do to you?</P>
<P>Do to me, <HI>says he,</HI> they would Hang me, if the
King had ne'er another Soldier in his Guards, I
shall certainly be Hang'd, as I am now alive.</P>
<P>THIS frighted me terribly, and <HI>I said,</HI> and what
will you do then? Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> I know not, I
would get out of the Nation if I knew how; but
I am a Stranger to all those things, and I know
not what to do, not I; advise me, <HI>Jack, says he,</HI>
prethee tell me whether shall I go, I have a good
mind to go to Sea.</P>
<P>You talk of going away, <HI>says I,</HI> what will you
do with all that you have hid in my Garret, it
must not lye there, <HI>said I,</HI> for if I should be taken
up for it; and it be found to be the Money you
Stole, I shall be ruin'd.</P>
<P>I CARE not what becomes of it, not I, <HI>says Will;</HI>
I'll be gone, do you take it, if you will, and do
what you will with it; I must Fly, and I cannot
take it with me: I won't have it, not I, <HI>says I,</HI>
to him, I'll go and fetch it to you if you will take
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, <HI>says I,</HI> but I wont meddle with it; besides,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is Plate, what shall I do with Plate, <HI>said I,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f I should offer to sell it any where, <HI>said I,</HI> they
will stop me?</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="98"/>
As for that, <HI>says Will,</HI> I cou'd Sell it well
enough, if I had it, but I must not be seen any
where among my old Acquaintance; for I am
blown, and they will all betray me: But I will
tell you where you shall go and Sell it if you
will; and they will ask you no Questions, if you
give them the Word that I will give you; so he
gave me the Word, and Directions to a Pawn-broker,
near <HI>Cloth-fair;</HI> the Word was <HI>GOOD
TOWER STANDARD;</HI> having these In∣structions,
<HI>be said,</HI> to me, Col. <HI>Jack,</HI> I am sure
you won't betray me; and I promise you if I
am taken, and should be Hang'd, I won't name
you, I will go to such a House, naming a House
at <HI>Eromley</HI> by <HI>Bow;</HI> where he and I had often been,
and there, <HI>says he,</HI> I'll stay till it is Dark; at
Night I will come near the Streets, and I will lye
under such a Hay-stack all Night, a place we both
knew also very well; and if you cannot finish to
come to me there, I will go back to <HI>Bow.</HI></P>
<P>I WENT back and took the Cargo, went to the
place by <HI>Cloth fair,</HI> and gave the Word, <HI>GOOD
TOWER STANDARD;</HI> and without any
words they took the Plate, weigh'd it, and paid
me after the Rate of 2<HI>s.</HI> per Ounce for it; so I
came away, and went to meet him; but it was
too late to meet him at the first place; but I went
to the Hay-stack, and there I found him fast a
sleep.</P>
<P>I DELIVER'D him his Cargo, what it really a∣mounted
to, I knew not, for I never told it;
but I went Home to my Quarters very late, and
Tyr'd: I went to Sleep at first, but not withstanding,
I was so weary I Slept little or none, for several
Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; at last being overcome with Sleep, I Dropt,
but was immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Rouz'd with Noise of People
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
knocking at the Door, as if they would beat it
down, and Crying and Calling out to the People
of the House, Rise, and let in the Constable here,
we come for your Lodger in the Garret.</P>
<P>I WAS frighted to the last degree, and started
up in my Bed; but when I was awake, I heard
no Noise at all, but of two <HI>Watch-men</HI> thumping
at the Doors with their Staves, and giving the
Hour past Three a Clock, and a Rainy wet Morn∣ing
<HI>for such it was:</HI> I was very glad when I sound
it was but a Dream, and went to Bed again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but
was soon Rouz'd a Second time, with the same,
very same Noise, and Words: Then being
sooner awak'd than I was before, I Jump'd out of
Bed and run to the Window, and found it was just
an Hour more, and the <HI>Watch-men</HI> were come
about past four a Clock, and they went away a∣gain
very quietly; so I say me down again, and
slept the rest of the Night quietly enough.</P>
<P>I LAY'D no stress upon the thing call'd a Dream,
neither till now did I understand that Dreams
were of any Importance: But getting up the next
Day, and going out with a Resolution. to meet
Brother <HI>WILL,</HI> who should I meet, but my for∣mer
Brother, Capt. <HI>Jack?</HI> When he saw me, he
came Close to me in his Blunt-way; and says, do
you hear the News? no, not I, <HI>said I,</HI> what
News? your old Comrade and Teacher is taken
this Morning and carried to <HI>Newgate;</HI> how! <HI>says I,</HI>
this Morning! yes, <HI>says he,</HI> this Morning, at 4 a
Clock, he is Charg'd with a Robbery and Mur∣ther;
some where beyond <HI>Brentford,</HI> and that
which is worse, is, that he is Impeach'd by one of
the Gang, who to save his own Life, has turn'd
Evidence; and therefore you had best consider,
<HI>says the Capt.</HI> what you have to do: What I have
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
to do! <HI>says I,</HI> and what do you mean by that?
Nay, Col. <HI>says he,</HI> don't be angry, you know best
if you are not in Danger; I am glad of it, but I
doubt not but you were with them: No, not I,
<HI>said I,</HI> again, I assure you, I was not; well, <HI>says
he,</HI> but if you were not with them this bout, you
have been with them at other times; and 'twill
be all one: Not I, <HI>says I,</HI> you are quite mistaken,
I am none of their Gang; they are above my
Quality; with such, and a little more talk of that
kind we parted, and Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> went away;
but as he went, I observ'd, he shook his Head,
seem'd to have more Concern upon him, than I
at first apprehended; and indeed, more than he
cou'd he suppos'd to have, meerly on my Account,
of which we shall hear more very quickly.</P>
<P>I WAS Extreamly allarm'd when I heard <HI>Will</HI>
was in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and had I known where to have
gone, would certainly have fled as far as Legs
would have carry'd me; my very Joints trembl'd,
and I was ready to sink into the Ground, and all
that Evening, and that Night following, I was
in the uttermost Consternation; my Head run
upon nothing but <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the Gallows, and
being Hang'd, which I said I deserv'd, if it were
for nothing but taking that two and twenty Shil∣lings
from the poor old Nurse.</P>
<P>THE first thing my perplex'd Thoughts allow'd
me to take care of, was my Money: This indeed lay
in a little Compass, and I carried it generally all
about me; I had got together as you will perceive
by the past Account, above Sixty Pounds, for I
spent nothing, and what to do with it I knew not,
at last it came into my Head, that I would go to
my Benefactor, the Clerk, at the <HI>Custom-bouse,</HI> if
he was to be found; and see if I could get him to
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
take the rest of my Money; the only Business was
to make a plausible Story to him, that he might
not wonder how I came by so much Money.</P>
<P>BUT my Invention quickly supply'd that want;
there was a Suit of Cloths at one of our Houses of
Rendezvous, which was left there for any of the
Gang to put on upon particular Occasions, as a
Disguise: This was Green Livery, Lac'd with
Pink Colour'd Galloon, and lin'd with the same;
an Edg'd Hat, a pair of Boots, and a Whip, I
went and Dress'd my self up in this Livery, and
went to my Gentleman, to his House in <HI>Tower∣street;</HI>
and there I found him in Health, and Well,
just the same honest Gentleman, as ever.</P>
<P>HE star'd at me when first I came to him, for I
meet him just at his Door; I say he star'd at me,
and seeing me Bow, and Bow to him several
times, with my Lac'd Hat under my Arm; at last
not knowing me in the least, <HI>says he,</HI> to me, Dost
thou want to speak with me, young Man? and I
said, yes, Sir, I believe your Worship (I had
learnt some Manners now) does not know me; I
am poor Boy <HI>Jack;</HI> he look'd hard at me, and then
Recollecting me presently, says he, <HI>who</HI> Col.
<HI>Jack! why where hast thou been all this while? why
'tis five or six Years since I saw you:</HI> 'Tis above Six
Years and please your Worship, <HI>says I.</HI></P>
<P>Well, and where hast thou been all this while,
<HI>says he?</HI></P>
<P>I have been in the Country, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> at
Service?</P>
<P>WELL,. Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> you give long Credit,
what's the Reason you han't fetch'd your Money
all this while, nor the Interest? why, you will
grow so rich in time by the Interest of your
Money, you won't know what to do with it.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102"/>
To that I said nothing, but Bow'd, and Scrap'd
a great many times; well come, Col. <HI>Jack, said
he,</HI> come in, and I will give you your Money, and
the Interest of it too.</P>
<P>I Cring'd, and Bow'd, and told him, I did not
come to him for my Money; for I had had a good
place or two, and I did not want my Money.</P>
<P>Well, Col. <HI>Jack, said he,</HI> and who do you Live
with?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Jonathan Loxham,</HI> said I, <HI>Sir,</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire</HI>
and please your Worship: This was a name I had
heard of, but knew nothing of any such Gentle∣man,
or of the Country.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says he,</HI> but won't you have your Money
<HI>Jack?</HI></P>
<P>No, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> if your Worship would please,
for I have had a good place.</P>
<P>If I would please to do, what prethee? your
Money is ready I tell thee.</P>
<P>No, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> but I have had a good place.</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and what doest thou mean <HI>Jack?</HI> I do not
understand thee.</P>
<P>Why, and please your Worship, my old Master,
Sir <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Father left me 30 <HI>l.</HI> when he Died,
and a Suit of Mourning, and—</P>
<P>And what prethee <HI>Jack,</HI> what hast thou brought
me more Money? for then he began to understand
what I meant.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> and your Worship would be
so good to take it, and put it all together, I have
sav'd some too out of my Wages.</P>
<P>I TOLD you, <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> you would be rich,
and how much hast thou sav'd, come let me
see it.</P>
<P>To shorten the Story, I pull'd it out, and he
was content to take it, giving me his Note, with
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
Interest, for the whole Sum, which amounted to
Ninety four Pounds, that is to say,
<Q><LIST>

<P>I CAME away exceeding Joyful, made him
abundance of Bows, and Scrapes, and went
immediately to shift my Cloaths again, with a
Resolution to run away from <HI>London,</HI> and see it no
more for a great while; but I was surpris'd the
very next Morning, when going cross <HI>Resemary∣lane,</HI>
by the End of the Place, which is call'd
<HI>Rag-Fair,</HI> I heard one call <HI>Jack,</HI> he had said some∣thing
before, which I did not hear, but upon
hearing the Name <HI>Jack,</HI> I look'd about me, imme∣diately
saw three Men, and after them a Consta∣ble
coming towards me with great Fury; I was
in a great Surprize, and started to run, but one
of them clap'd in upon me, and got hold of me,
and in a Moment the rest surrounded me, and
I was taken, I ask'd them what they wanted,
and what I had done; they told me it was no
Place to Talk of that there; but show'd me their
Warrant, and bad me read it, and I should know
the rest when I came before the Justice, so they
hurried me away.</P>
<P>I took the Warrant, but to my great Affliction,
I could know nothing by that, for I could not
read, so I desir'd them to read it, and they read
it that they were to Apprehend a known Thief,
that went by the Name of one of the three <HI>Jacks</HI> of
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
<HI>Rag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fair,</HI> for that he was Charg'd upon Oath, with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving been a Party in a notorious Robbery,
Burglary, and Murther, committed so and so, in
such a Place, and on such a Day.</P>
<P>IT was to no purpose for me to deny it, or to
say I knew nothing of it, that was none of their
Business they said; that must be disputed, they told
me, before the Justice, where I would find that it
was sworn positively against me, and then per∣haps
I might be better satisfied.</P>
<P>I HAD no remedy, but Patience, and as my
Heart was full of Terror and Guilt, so I was ready
to die with the weight of it; as they carried me a
long, for as I very well knew that I was Guilty
of the first Days work, tho' I was not of the
last; so I did not doubt, but I should be sent
to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and then I took it for granted I
must be hang'd; for to go to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and to be
hang'd were to me, as things which necessarily
followed one another.</P>
<P>BUT I had a sharp Conflict to go thro' before
it came to that Part, and that was before the Ju∣stice,
where when I was come, and the Constable
brought me in, the Justice ask'd me my name;
but, hold, <HI>says he,</HI> young Man, before I ask you
your Name, let me do you Justice, you are not
bound to answer till your Accusers come, so turn∣ing
to the Constable, he ask'd for his Warrant.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says the Justice,</HI> you have brought this
young Man here by Vertue of this Warrant;
is this young Man the Person for whom this War∣rant
is granted?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so, and please your Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe so. Why are you not sure of it?
<HI>Con.</HI> An't please your Worship, the People
said so, where I took him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a very particular kind of Warrant,
it is to apprehend a young Man, who goes by the
Name of <HI>Jack,</HI> but no Sir Name, only that it is
said, he is call'd Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI> or some other such
Name. Now young Man, pray is your Name
Capt. <HI>Jack?</HI> or are you usually call'd so?</P>
<P>I presently found, that the Men that took me
knew nothing of me, and that the Constable had
taken me up by Hear-say, so I took Heart and told
the Justice, that I thought with submission, that it
was not the present Question, what my Name was,
but what these Men, or any one else had to lay to
to my Charge, whether I was the Person, who the
Warrant empower'd to Apprehend or no.</P>
<P>HE smil'd, 'tis very true young Man, <HI>says he,</HI>
it is very true, and on my Word, if they have
taken you up, and do not know you, and there
is no Body to Charge you, they will be mistaken
to their own Damage.</P>
<P>THEN I told his Worship, I hop'd I should not
be oblig'd to tell my Name till my Accuser was
brought to Charge me, and then I should not con∣ceal
my Name.</P>
<P>IT is but Reason, said his good Worship, Mr.
<HI>Constable,</HI> turning to the Officers; are you sure
this is the Person that is intended in your War∣rant?
if you are not, you must fetch the Person
that Accuses him, and on whose Oath the War∣rant
was granted: They us'd many Words to insi∣nuate
that I was the Person, and that I knew it
well enough, and that I should be oblig'd to tell
my Name.</P>
<P>I insisted on the unreasonableness of it, and
that I should not be oblig'd to accuse myself, and
the Justice told them in so many Words, that he
could not force me to it, that I might do it if I
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
would indeed; but you see, <HI>says the Justice,</HI> he under∣stood
too well, to be impos'd upon in that Case;
so that in short, after an Hours Debating before
his Worship, in which time I pleaded against
four of them, the Justice told them they must
produce the Accuser, or he must Discharge me.</P>
<P>I WAS greatly encouraged at this, and argued
with the more Vigour for myself; at length the
Accuser was brought Fettered as he was from the
Goal, and glad I was when I saw him, and found
that I knew him not, <HI>that is to say,</HI> that it was
not one of the two Rogues that I went out with
that Night, that we robb'd the poor old Wo∣man.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prisoner was brought into the Room,
he was set right against me.</P>
<P>Do you know this young Man? <HI>says the Ju∣stice.</HI></P>
<P>No,
Sir, <HI>says the Prisoner,</HI> I never saw him in
my Life.</P>
<P>HUM, <HI>says the Justice,</HI> Did not you Charge one
that goes by the Name of <HI>Jack,</HI> or Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI>
as concern'd in the Robbery and Murther, which
you are in Custody for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an't please your Worship, <HI>says the
Prisoner.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the Man, or is he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not the Man, Sir, I never saw
this Man before.</P>
<P>VERY good Mr. Constable, <HI>says the Justice,</HI>
What muste we do now?</P>
<P>I AM surpriz'd, <HI>says the Constable;</HI> I was at such
a House, naming the House, and this young Man
went by, the People cryed out there's <HI>Jack,</HI> that's
your Man, and these People run after him, and
apprehended him.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107"/>
WELL, <HI>says the Justice,</HI> and have these Peo∣ple
any thing to say to him? can they prove that he
is the Person?</P>
<P>ONE said no, and the other said no; and in
short, they all said no, Why then said the <HI>Justice,</HI>
what can be done? the young Man must be Dis∣charg'd;
and I must tell you Mr. Constable, and
you Gentlemen that have brought him hither,
he may give you Trouble, if he thinks fit for
your being so rash; but look you young Man,
<HI>says the Justice,</HI> you have no great Damage done
you, and the Constable, tho' he has been Mista∣ken,
had no ill-design, but to be Faithful to his
Office; I think you may pass it by.</P>
<P>I TOLD his Worship, I would readily pass
it by, at his Direction; but I thought the Con∣stable,
and the rest cou'd do no less than to go
back to the Place where they had insulted me,
and Declare publickly there that I was honoura∣bly
acquitted, and that I was not the Man: This
his Worship said was very Reasonable, and the
Constable, and his Assistants promis'd to do it,
and so we came all away good Friends, and I was
clear'd with Triumph.</P>
<P>NOTE</P>
<P>“THIS was the Time that as I mention'd a∣bove,
the Justice talk'd to me, told me I was
born to better Things, and that by my
well managing of my own Defence, he
did not question but I had been well Edu∣cated,
and that he was sorry I should fall
into such a Misfortune as this, which he
hop'd however would be no Dishonour to
me, since I was so handsomely acquitted.”</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="108"/>
THO' his Worship was mistaken in the Matter
of my Education, yet it had this good Effect upon
me, that I resolv'd if it was possible I would learn
to Read and Write, that I would not be such an un∣capable
Creature, that I should not be able to read
a Warrant, and see whether I was the Person to
be Apprehended or not.</P>
<P>BUT there was something more in all this,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what I have taken notice of; for in a Word,
it appear'd plainly that my Brother Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI>
who had the forwardness to put it to me, whether
I was among them, or no, when in Truth he was
there himself, had the only Reason to be afraid
to flye, at the same time, that he advised me to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for my self.</P>
<P>As this presently occur'd to my Thoughts;
so I made it my Business to enquire, and find
him out, and to give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im notice of it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, being now Confident of my
own Safety, I had no more Concern upon my
Mind about myself; but now I began to be anxi∣ous
for poor <HI>Will,</HI> my Master and Tutor in Wick∣edness,
who was now fast by the Heels in <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
while I was happily at Liberty, and I want∣ed
very much to go and see him, and accordingly
did so.</P>
<P>I FOUND him in a sad Condition loaden with
heavy Irons, and had himself no prospect or
hope of Escaping; he told me he should
die, but bid me be easie; for as it would do
him no good to accuse me, who never was out
with any of them, but that once; so I might de∣pend
upon it, he would not bring me into the
Trouble; as for the Rogue, who had betray'd them
all, he was not able to hurt me, for I might be
satisfied he had never seen me in his Life; but
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> I will tell you who was with
us, and that is your Brother the Captain,
and the Villain has certainly nam'd him, and
therefore, <HI>says he,</HI> if you can give him
timely Notice of it, do, that he may make his
Escape.</P>
<P>HE said a great many things to warn me of
following the steps he had led me; I was far out
<HI>Jack, said he,</HI> when I told you to be a notorious
Thief, was to live like a Gentleman; he chiefly
discover'd his concern that they had, as he fear'd
killed the Gentleman's Gardiner, and that he in
particular had given him a Wound in the Neck,
of which he was afraid he would die.</P>
<P>HE had a great Sum of Money in Gold about
him, being the same that I had carried back to him
at the Hay-Stack; and he had concealed it so well,
that those that took him had not found it, and he
gave me the greatest Part of it, to carry to his
Mother, which I very honestly delivered, and
came away with a heavy Heart; nor did I ever
see him since, for he was Executed in about three
Weeks time after, being condemn'd that very next
Sessions.</P>
<P>I HAD nothing to do now, but to find the Capt.
who tho' not without some trouble, I at last got
News of, and told him the whole Story, and
how I had been taken up for him by mistake, and
was come off, but that the Warrant was still out for
him, and very strict search after him; <HI>I say,</HI> tel∣ling
him all this, he presently discover'd by his
surprize that he was Guilty, and after a few
Words more, told me plainly it was all true; that
he was in the Robbery, and that he had the great∣est
Part of the Booty in keeping, but what to
do with it, or himself he did not know, and
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
wanted me to tell him, which I was very unfit to
do, for I knew nothing of the World; then he
told me, he had a Mind to fly into <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was easie to be done, and ask'd me if I would go
with him: I told him I would with all my Heart, if I
had Money enough to bear the Charge; he had the
Trade still in his Eyes by his answer, I warrant
you, <HI>says he,</HI> we will make the Journey pay our
Charge; I dare not think of going any more up∣on
the Adventure, <HI>says I,</HI> besides, if we meet with
any Misfortune out of our Knowledge, we shall
never get out of it, we shall be undone; nay,
<HI>says he,</HI> we shall find no Mercy here, if they can
catch us, and they can do no worse Abroad, I am
for venturing at all.</P>
<P>WELL, but Captain, <HI>says I,</HI> have you Husbanded
your time so ill, that you have no Money to sup∣ply
you in such a Time as this; I have very little
indeed, <HI>said he,</HI> for I have had bad luck lately;
but he lyed, for he had a great Share of the Booty
they had got at their last Adventure, as above, and
as the rest complain'd, he and <HI>Will</HI> had got almost
all of it, and kept the rest out of their Shares,
which made them the willinger to discover them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it was, he own'd about 22<HI>l.</HI> he had
in Money, and something that would yield Mo∣ney,
I suppose it was Plate; but he would not
tell me what it was, or where it was, but he said,
he durst not go to fetch it, for he should be be∣tray'd
and seiz'd, so he would venture without it;
sure, <HI>says he,</HI> we shall come back again some time,
or other.</P>
<P>I honestly produc'd all the Money I had, which
was Sixteen Pound, and some odd Shillings: Now,
<HI>says I,</HI> if we are good Husbands, and Travel fru∣gally,
this will carry us quite out of Danger, for
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
we had both been assur'd, that when we came out
of <HI>England,</HI> we should be both Safe, and no Bo∣dy
could Hurt us, tho' they had known us; but
we neither of us thought it was so many weary
steps to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as we found it.</P>
<P>I speak of myself, as in the same Circum∣stances
of Danger, with Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> but it was
only thus, I was in as much Fear as he, but not
in quite as much Danger.</P>
<P>I cannot omit that in the Interval of these
things, and a few Days before I carried my Mo∣ney
to the Gentleman in <HI>Tower-street;</HI> I took a
Walk all alone into the Fields, in order to go to
<HI>Kentish-Town,</HI> and do Justice to the poor old Nurse;
it happen'd that before I was aware I cross'd a
Field that came to the very Spot where I robb'd
the poor old Woman, and that Maid, or where I
should say <HI>Will,</HI> made me rob them; my Heart
had reproach'd me many a time with that cruel
Action, and many a time I had promis'd to my∣self
that I would find a way to make her Satis∣faction,
and restore her Money, and that Day I
had Set a part for the Work; but was a little sur∣priz'd
that I was so suddenly upon the unhappy
Spot.</P>
<P>THE Place brought to my Mind the Villany I
had committed there, and something struck me
with a kind of Wish, I cannot say Prayer, for
I know not what that meant, that I might leave
off that curs'd Trade; and said to myself, O! that
I had some Trade to live by, I would never rob
no more, for sure 'tis a wicked abominable Thing.</P>
<P>HERE indeed I felt the loss of what just Pa∣rents
do, and ought to do by all their Children; I
mean being bred to some Trade, or Employment,
and I wept many times, that I knew not what to
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
do, or what to turn my Hand to, tho' I resolved to
leave off the wicked Course I was in.</P>
<P>BUT to return to my Journey, I ask'd my way
to <HI>Kentish-Town,</HI> and it happen'd to be of a poor
Woman, that said she liv'd there, upon which In∣telligence
I ask'd, if she knew a Woman that lived
there, whose Name was <HI>Smith?</HI> She answer'd, yes,
very well, that she was not a settled Inhabitant,
only a Lodger in the Town, but that she was an
honest poor industrious Woman, and by her La∣bour
and Pains, maintain'd a poor diseas'd Hus∣band,
that had been unable to help himself some
Years.</P>
<P>WHAT a Villain have I been! <HI>said I,</HI> to my∣self,
that I should rob such a poor Woman as this,
and add Grief, and Tears to her Misery, and to
the Sorrows of her House? This quicken'd my
Resolution to restore her Money, and not only
so, but I resolv'd I would give her something o∣ver
and above her Loss; so I went forward, and
by the Direction I had receiv'd, found her Lodging
with very little Trouble; then asking for the
Woman, she came to the Door immediately, for
she heard me ask for her by her Name; of a little
Girl that came first to the Door; I presently spoke
to her, Dame, <HI>said I,</HI> was not you robb'd about a
Year ago, as you was coming home from <HI>London,</HI>
about <HI>Pindar of Wakefields?</HI> yes indeed I was, <HI>says
she,</HI> and sadly frighted into the Bargain; and how
much did you lose? <HI>said I,</HI> indeed, <HI>says she,</HI> I lost all
the Money I had in the World; I am sure I work'd
hard for it, it was Money for keeping a Nurse
Child, that I had then, and I had been at <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to receive it; but how much was it Dame?
<HI>said I,</HI> why, <HI>says she,</HI> it was Two and Twenty Shil∣lings
and Six-Pence Half-penny; One and Twen∣ty
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
Shillings I had been to fetch, and the odd Mo∣ney
was my own before.</P>
<P>WELL, look you good Woman, what will you
say if I should put you in a way to get your Mo∣ney
again; for I believe the Fellow that took it
is fast enough now, and perhaps I may do you a
kindness in it, and for that I came to see you? O
Dear, says the old Woman, I understand you,
but indeed I cannot Swear to the Man's Face a∣gain;
for it was Dark, and besides, I would not
Hang the poor Wretch for my Money, let him
live and Repent: That is very kind, <HI>says I,</HI> more
than he deserves from you, but you need not be
Concern'd about that, for he will be Hang'd, whe∣ther
you appear against him or not: But are you
willing to have your Money again that you lost?
Yes, indeed, says the Woman, I should be glad
of that, for I have not been so hard put to it for
Money a great while, as I am now; I have much
a do to find us Bread to Eat, though I work hard
early and late, and with that she Cryed.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it would have broke my very
Heart, to think how this poor Creature work'd,
and was a Slave at near Threescore, and that I a
young Fellow of hardly Twenty, should Rob her
of her Bread to Support my Idleness, and Wicked
Life; and the Tears came from my Eyes, in spight
of all my strugling to prevent it, and the Woman
perceiv'd it too; poor Woman, <HI>said I,</HI> 'tis a sad thing
such Creatures as these should plunder, and strip
such a poor Object as thou art; well, he is at
Leisure now to Repent it, I assure you; I perceive
Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> you are very Compassionate, indeed,
I wish he may Improve the time God has spar'd
him, and that he may Repent, and I pray God
give him Repentance, who ever he is, I forgive
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
him, whether he can make me Recompence, or not,
and I pray God forgive him, I won't do him any
Prejudice, not I; and that she went on Praying
for me.</P>
<P>WELL, Dame, come hither to me, <HI>says I,</HI> and
with that I put my Hand in my Pocket, and she
came to me: Hold up your Hand, <HI>said I,</HI> which
she did, and I told her Nine half Crowns into
her Hand; there Dame, <HI>said I,</HI> is your 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> you
lost, I assure you, Dame, <HI>said I,</HI> I have been the
chief Instrument to get it of him for you; for
ever since he told me the Story of it among the
rest of his wicked Exploits; I never gave him any
rest till I made him promise me to make you Resti∣tution:
All the while I held her Hand, and put the
Money into it, I look'd in her Face, and I per∣ceiv'd
her Colour come, and go, and that she was
under the greatest Surprize of Joy Imaginable.</P>
<P>WELL, God bless him, <HI>says she,</HI> and spare him
from the Disaster he is afraid of, if it be his will;
for sure, this is an Act of so much Justice, and so
Honest, that I never expected the like; she run
on a great while so, and wept for him; when I
told her, I doubted there was no room to expect
his Life: Well, <HI>says she,</HI> then pray God give him
Repentance, and bring him to Heaven, for sure
he must have something that is Good at the But∣tom;
he has a Principle of Honesty at Bottom, to
be sure; however, he may have been brought in∣to
bad Courses, by bad Company, and evil Exam∣ple,
or other Temptations: But I dare say he will
be brought to Repentance, one time or other, be∣fore
he Dies.</P>
<P>ALL this touch'd me nearer than she Imagin'd,
for I was the Man that she pray'd for all this
while; though she did not know it, and in my
Heart I said <HI>Amen</HI> to it; for I was sensible that I
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
had done one of the vilest Actions, in the World,
in attacking a poor Creature in such a Condition,
and not lissening to her Entreaties, when she
begg'd so heartily for that little Money we took
from her.</P>
<P>IN a Word, the good Woman so mov'd me
with her Charitable Prayers; that I put my Hand
in my Pocket again for her, Dame, <HI>said I,</HI> you
are so Charitable in your Petitions for this misera∣ble
Creature, that it puts me in Mind of one thing
more, which I will do for him, whether he order'd
me or not; and that is, to ask you Forgiveness
for the Thief in robbing you, for it was an Of∣fence,
and a Trespass against you, as well as an
Injury to you; and therefore I ask your Pardon
for him, will you Sincerely and Heartily forgive
him, Dame? I do desire it of you; and with that
I stood up, and with my Hat off, ask'd her Par∣don;
O Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> do not stand up, and with
your Hat off to me, I am a poor Woman, I for∣give
him, and all that were with him; for there
was one or more with him, I forgive them with
all my Heart; and I pray God to forgive them.</P>
<P>WELL, Dame, then, <HI>said I,</HI> to make you some
Recompence for your Charity; there is something
for you more than your Loss; and with that I
gave her a Crown more.</P>
<P>THEN I ask'd her, who that was, who was robb'd
with her? She said, it was a Servant Maid that
liv'd then in the Town, but she was gone from
her place, and she did not know where she liv'd
now: Well Dame, <HI>says I,</HI> if ever you do hear of
her, let her leave Word where she may be found;
and if I live to come and see you again, I will get
the Money of him for her too; I think that was
but little, was it, no, <HI>says she,</HI> it was but 5<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
which I knew as well as she; well, <HI>says I,</HI> Dame,
enquire her out if you have Opportunity; so she
promis'd me she would, and away I came.</P>
<P>THE Satisfaction this gave me, was very much,
but then a Natural Consequence attended it,
which fill'd me with Reflection afterwards, and
this was, that by the same Rule, I ought to make
Restitution to all that I had wrong'd, in the like
manner; and what cou'd I do, as to that? To this
I knew not what to say; and so the Thought in
time wore off, for in short it was impossible to be
done: I had not Ability, neither did I know any
of the People who I had so Injur'd, and that sa∣tisfying
me for the present, I let it Drop.</P>
<P>I COME now to my Journey, with Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI>
my suppos'd Brother: We set out from <HI>London</HI> on
Foot, and Travel'd the first Day to <HI>Ware,</HI> for we
had learnt so much of our Road, that the way lay
thro' that Town; we were weary enough the first
Day, having not been us'd at all to Travelling;
but we made shift to walk once up and down the
Town, after we came into it.</P>
<P>I SOON found, that his walking out to see the
Town, was not to satisfie his Curiosity in viewing
the Place; for he had no Notion of any thing of
that Kind, but to see if he cou'd light of any Pur∣chase,
for he was so natural a Thief, that he cou'd
see nothing on the Road, but it occur'd to him;
how easily that might be taken, and how cleverly
this might be carry'd off, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING offer'd in <HI>Ware</HI> to his Mind, it not
being Market-Day, and as for me, tho' I made
no great scruple of Eating and Drinking at the
Cost of his Roguery, yet I resolv'd not to enter
upon any thing, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> nor to take the
least thing from any Body.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117"/>
WHEN the Captain found me resolv'd upon
the Negative, he ask'd me, how I thought to Tra∣vel?
I ask'd him what he thought of himself,
that was sure to be hang'd, if he was taken, how
small soever the Crime was, that he should be
taken for? How can that be? <HI>says he,</HI> they don't
know me in the Country; ay, <HI>says I,</HI> but do you
think they do not send up Word to <HI>Newgate</HI> as
soon as any Thief is taken in the Country, and
so enquire who is escap'd from them, or who
is fled, that they may be stopp'd? assure yourself,
<HI>says I,</HI> the Jaylors Correspond with one another,
with the greatest Exactness imaginable; and if
you were taken here but for stealing a Basket of
Eggs, you shall have your Accuser sent down to
see if he knows you.</P>
<P>THIS terrify'd him a little for a while, and
kept him honest, for three or four Days; but it
was but for a few Days indeed; for he play'd a
great many Rogues Tricks without me, till at
last he came to his End without me too, tho' it
was not till many Years after, as you shall hear
in its Order; but as these Exploits are no
part of my Story, but of his, whose Life and
Exploits are sufficient to make a Volume larger
than this by itself; so I shall omit every thing,
but what I was particularly concern'd in, during
this tedious Journey.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Ware</HI> we Travell'd to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> tho'
that was not our direct Road, the occasion was
this<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in our way going thro' a Village, call'd
<HI>Puckeridge,</HI> we baited at an <HI>Inn,</HI> at the Sign of
the <HI>Faulcon,</HI> and while we were there, a Country∣man
comes to the <HI>Inn,</HI> and hangs his Horse at the
Door, while he goes in to Drink; we sat in the
Gate-way, having called for a Mug of Beer, and
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
drank it up: We had been talking with the Host∣ler
about the way to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and he had bid us
ask the Road to <HI>Royston; but says he,</HI> there is a
Turning just here a little farther, you must not
go that Way, for that goes to <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>WE had paid for our Beer, and sat at the Door,
only to rest us, when on the sudden, comes a
Gentleman's Coach to the Door, and three or
four Horsemen; the Horsemen rod into the Yard,
and the Hostler was oblig'd to go in with them;
<HI>says be,</HI> to the Captain, young Man pray take
hold of the Horse, meaning the Countryman's
Horse, I mention'd above, and take him out of
the way, that the Coach may come up; he did so,
and beckon'd to me to follow him; we walked to∣gether
to the Turning, <HI>says he,</HI> to me, do you step
afore, and turn up the <HI>Lane,</HI> I'll overtake you;
so I went on up the <HI>Lane,</HI> and in a few Minutes
he was got up upon the Horse, and at my Heels,
come get up, <HI>says he,</HI> we will have a lift, if we
don't get the Horse by the Bargain.</P>
<P>I MADE no difficulty to get up behind him, and
away we went at a good round Rate, it being a good
strong Horse: We lost no time for an Hours
riding, and more, by which time we thought we
were out of the reach of being pursued, and as
the Countryman, when he should miss his Horse,
would hear that we enquir'd the way to <HI>Royston,</HI>
he would certainly pursue us that way, and not
towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we went easier after the first
Hours riding, and coming thro' a Town or two
we a lighted by Turns, and did not ride Double
thro' the Villages.</P>
<P>Now as it was impossible for the Captain to pass
by any thing that he could lay his Hand on, and
not take it, so now having a Horse to carry it
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
off too, the Temptation was the stronger; going
thro' a Village, where a good Housewife of the
House had been Washing, and hung her Cloths
out upon a Hedge, near the Road, he could not help
it, but got hold of a Couple of good Shirts, that
were but about half dry, and over-took me upon
the Spur; for I walk'd on Foot before; I imme∣diately
got up behind, and away we Gallop'd to∣gether
as fast as the Horse would well go; in this
Part of our Expedition his good luck or Mine,
carried us quite out of the Road, and having
seen no Body to ask the way of, we lost our selves,
and wandered I know not how many Miles to
the Right Hand, till Partly by that means, and
Partly by the Occasion following, we came quite
into the Coach Road to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI>
by <HI>Bishop-Stortford;</HI> the particular Occasion that
made me wander on was thus; the Country was
all open Cornfields, no Enclosures; when being
upon a little rising Ground, I Bad him stop the
Horse, for I would get down, and walk a little
to ease my Legs, being tyr'd with riding so long
behind without Stirrups; when I was down, and
look'd a little about me; I saw plainly the Great
white Road, which we should have gone at near
two Miles from us.</P>
<P>ON a sudden, looking a little back to my Left,
upon that Road, I saw four or five Horsemen,
riding full Speed, some a good way before the o∣ther,
and hurring on as People in a full pursuit.</P>
<P>IT immediately struck me; Ha, Brother <HI>Jack,
says I,</HI> get off of the Horse this Moment, and
ask why afterwards; so he jumps off, What's the
matter? <HI>says he,</HI> the matter, <HI>says I,</HI> look yonder,
'tis well we have lost our Way; do you see how
they ride, they are pursuing us you may depend
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
upon it, either, <HI>says I,</HI> you are pursued from the
last Village for the two Shirts, or from <HI>Puckeridge,</HI>
for the Horse. He had so much Presence of Mind,
that without my mentioning it to him, he puts
back the Horse behind a great white-Thorn Bush,
which grew just by him; so that they could by no
means see the Horse, which we being just at the
Top of the Hill they might otherwise have done,
and so have pursued that way at a venture.</P>
<P>BUT as it was impossible for them to see the
Horse, so was it as impossible for them to see us
at that distance, who sat down on the Ground to
look at them the more securely.</P>
<P>THE Road winding about, we saw them a great
way, and they rod as fast as they could make
their Horses go; when we found they were gone
quite out of Sight, we mounted, and made the
best of our way also; and indeed, tho' we were
two upon one Horse, yet we abated no speed
where the way would admit of it, not enquiring of
any Body the way to any where, till after a∣bout
two Hours riding, we came to a Town, which
upon Enquiry, they call'd <HI>Chesterford,</HI> and here
we stopp'd, and ask'd not our way to any Place, but
whether that Road went, and were told it was the
Coach Road to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> also that it was the
Way to <HI>New-Market,</HI> to St. <HI>Edmunds-Bury,</HI> to <HI>Nor∣wich</HI>
and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to <HI>Lyn,</HI> and to <HI>Ely,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P>WE staid here a good while believing ourselves
secure, and afterwards towards Evening went
forward to a Place, call'd <HI>Bourn-Bridge,</HI> where
the Road to <HI>Cambridge</HI> turns away out of
the Road to <HI>New-Market,</HI> and where there are
but two Houses only, both of them being <HI>Inns▪</HI>
Here the Captain <HI>says to me,</HI> Hark ye, you see
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
we are pursued towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and shall be
stop'd if we go thither; now <HI>New-Market</HI> is but
ten Miles off, and there we may be safe, and per∣haps
get an opportunity to do some Business.</P>
<P>Look ye, <HI>Jack, said I,</HI> talk no more of doing
Business, for I will not joyn with you in any
thing of that Kind; I would fain get you to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
before you get a Halter about your Neck, I will
not have you hang'd in <HI>England,</HI> if I can help it,
and therefore I won't go to <HI>New-Market,</HI> unless
you will promise me to make no false steps there:
Well, <HI>says he,</HI> if I must not, then I won't; but I hope
you will let us get another Horse, won't you?
that we may Travel faster; no, <HI>says I,</HI> I won't
agree to that, but if you will let me send this
Horse back fairly, I will tell you how we shall
hire Horses afterwards, for one Stage▪ or two, and
then take them as far as we please; 'tis only send∣ing
a Letter to the Owner to send for him, and
then, if we are stopp'd, it can do us but little
Hurt.</P>
<P>You are a wary Politick Gentleman, <HI>says the
Captain,</HI> but, <HI>I say,</HI> we are better as we are; for
we are out of all Danger of being stopp'd on the
Way after we are gone from this Place.</P>
<P>WE had not Parl'd thus long; but tho' in the Dead
of the Night, came a Man to the other <HI>Inn</HI> Door,
for as above, there are two <HI>Inns</HI> at that Place, and
call'd for a Pot of Beer, but the People were all
in Bed, and would not Rise; he ask'd them if
they had seen two Fellows come that way upon
one Horse: The Man, <HI>said he had,</HI> that they went
by in the Afternoon, and ask'd the Way to <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI>
but did not stop only to drink one M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g: O!
<HI>says he,</HI> are they gone to <HI>Cambridge?</HI> then I'll be
with them quickly: I was awake in a little Gar∣ret
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
of the next Inn, where we Lodg'd; and hear∣ing
the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow call at the Door, got up, and went
to the Window, having some uneasiness at every
Noise I heard; and by that means heard the whole
Story: New, the case is plain, our Hour was not
come, our Fate had Determin'd other things for
us, and we were to be reserv'd for it, the matter
was thus; when we first came to <HI>Bourn-Bridge,</HI>
we call'd at the first House, and ask'd the Way to
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> Drank a Mug of Beer, and went on,
and they might see us turn off to go the way they
Directed; but Night coming on, and we being
very Weary, we thought we should not find the
way; and we came back in the Dusk of the Even∣ing,
and went into the other House, being the
first as we came back, as that where we call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be∣fore,
was the first, as we went forward.</P>
<P>YOU may be sure I was allarm'd now, as indeed
I had Reason to be; the Captain was in Bed, and
fast a Sleep, but I Wak'd him, and Rouz'd him
with a Noise that frighted him enough; Rise, <HI>Jack,
said I,</HI> we are both Ruin'd, they are come after us
hither; indeed, I was wrong to terrify him at that
Rate; for he started, and jumpt out of Bed, and
run directly to the Window, not knowing where
he was; and not quite awake, was just going
to Jump out of the Window, but I laid hold of
him; what are you going to do? <HI>Says I,</HI> I won't be
taken, <HI>says he,</HI> let me alone, <HI>where are they?</HI></P>
<P>THIS was all Confusion, and he was so out of
himself with the Fright; and being overcome
with Sleep, that I had much to do to prevent his
jumping out of the Window: However, I held
him fast, and thoroughly waken'd him, and then
all was well again, and he was presently compos'd.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123"/>
THEN I told him the Story, and we sat toge∣ther
upon the Bed-side; considering, what we
should do: Upon the whole, as the Fellow that
call'd, was apparently gone on to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> we
had nothing to sear, but to be quiet till Day break,
and then to Mount and be gone.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, as soon as Day peep'd, we
were up, and having happily inform'd ourselves
of the Road at the other House; and being told
that the Road to <HI>Cambridge</HI> turn'd off on the left
Hand, and that the Road to <HI>New-Market</HI> lay strait
forward; I say, having learn't this, the Captain
told me he would walk away on Foot towards
<HI>New-Market;</HI> and so when I came to go out, I
should appear as a single Traveller; accordingly
he went out immediately, and away he walk'd,
and he Travell'd so hard, that when I came to fol∣low,
I thought once that he had Dropp'd me, for
tho' I Rid hard, I got no sight of him for an Hour;
at length having pass'd the great Bank call'd the
<HI>Divel's-Ditch,</HI> I found him, and took him up be∣hind
me, and we Rode Double till we came al∣most
to the end of <HI>New-Market</HI> Town; just at the
hither House in the Town, stood a Horse at a
Door, just as it was at <HI>Puckeridge:</HI> Now, <HI>says
Jack,</HI> if the Horse was at the other end of the
Town, I would have him, as sure as we had the
'tother at <HI>Puckeridge;</HI> but it would not do, so he
got down, and Walk'd thro' the Town on the right
Hand side of the Way.</P>
<P>HE had not got half thro' the Town, but the
Horse having some how or other got loose, came
Trotting gently on by himself, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d no body fol∣lowing
him; the Captain, an old Soldier at such
Work, as soon as the Horse was got a pretry way
before him, and that he saw no Body follow'd,
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
sets up a run after the Horse; and the Horse hear∣ing
him follow, run the faster; then the Captain
calls out, stop the Horse, and by this time the
Horse was got almost to the farther end of the
Town; the People of the House where he stood,
not missing him all the while.</P>
<P>UPON his calling out stop the Horse, the Poor
People of the Town, such as were next Hand,
run from both sides the Way and stopp'd the Horse
for him, as readily as cou'd be; and held him for
him, till he came up; he very Gravely comes up
to the Horse, hits him a Blow or two, and calls
him Dog for running away; gives the Man 2<HI>d.</HI>
that catch'd him for him, Mounts, and away he
comes after me.</P>
<P>THIS was the oddest Adventure that cou'd have
happen'd, for the Horse stole the Capt. the Capt.
did not steal the Horse; when he came up to me,
now Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> what say you to good luck,
would you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad me refus'd the Horse, when
he came so Civily to ask me to Ride? No, no,
<HI>said I,</HI> you have got this Horse by your Wit, not
by Design, and you may go on now I think, you
are in a safer Condition than I am, if we are taken.</P>
<P>THE next Question was, what Road we should
take; here were four ways before us, and we
were alike Strangers to them all; first on the right
Hand, and at about a little Mile from the Town,
a great Road went off to St. <HI>Edmund's-Bury;</HI> strait
on, but enclining afterwards to the right, lay the
Great Road to <HI>Barton Mills,</HI> and <HI>Thetford,</HI> and so
to <HI>Norwich;</HI> and full before us lay a great Road
also to <HI>Brandon</HI> and <HI>Lynn,</HI> and on the left, lay a
less Road to the City of <HI>Ely,</HI> and into the Fens.</P>
<P>IN short, as we knew not which Road to take,
nor which way to get into the great North Road,
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
which we had left; so we by meer unguided Chance
took the way to <HI>Brandon,</HI> and so to <HI>Lynn:</HI> At <HI>Brand,</HI>
or <HI>Brandon;</HI> we were told that passing over at a
place call'd <HI>Downham Bridge,</HI> we might cross the
Fenn Country to <HI>Wisbich;</HI> and from thence g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> along
that Bank of the River <HI>Nyne</HI> to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Stamford,</HI> where we were in the
Northen Road again; and likewise, that at <HI>Lynn,</HI>
we might go by the Washes into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and
so might Travel North. But upon the whole,
this was my Rule, that when we enquir'd the way
to any particular Place, to be sure we never took
that Road, but some other; which the accidental
Discourse we might have, should bring in, and
thus we did here, for having chiefly ask'd our
way into the Northern Road, we resolv'd to go
directly for <HI>Lynn.</HI></P>
<P>WE arriv'd here very easy and safe, and while
we was considering of what way we should Tra∣vel
next; we found we were got to a Point, and
that there was no way now left, but that by the
Washes into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and that was represen∣ted
as very Dangerous; so an Opportunity offer∣ing
of a Man that was Travelling over the Fenns;
we took him for our Guide, and went with him
to <HI>Spalding,</HI> and from thence to a Town call'd
<HI>Deeping,</HI> and so to <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a large populous Town, and it was
Market Day when we came to it; so we put in at
a little House, at the hither end of the Town, and
Walk'd into the Town.</P>
<P>HERE it was not possible to restrain my
Captain from playing his Feats of Art, and my
Heart ak'd for him; I told him I would not go
with him, for he would not promise, and I
was so terribly concern'd at the Apprehensions of
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
his ventrous Humour, that I would not so much
as stir out of my Lodging; but it was in vain to
perswade him; he went into the Market, and found
a <HI>Mountebank</HI> there, which was what he wanted;
how he pick'd two Pockets there in one Quarter of
an Hour and brought to our Quarters a Peice of new
<HI>Holland,</HI> of eight or nine Ells; a Peice of Stuff, and
played three or four Pranks more, in less than two
Hours; and how afterward he robb'd a Doctor of
Physick, and yet came off clear in them all; this
I say, <HI>as above,</HI> belongs to his Story, not to
Mine.</P>
<P>I scolded heartily at him, when he came back,
and told him he would certainly ruin himself, and
me too before he left off, and threaten'd in so
many Words, that I would leave him, and go
back, and carry the Horse to <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> where
we borrow'd it, and so go to <HI>London</HI> by my∣self.</P>
<P>HE promis'd amendment, but as we resolv'd now
we were in the Great Road to Travel by Night,
so it being not yet Night, he gives me the slip a∣gain,
and was not gone half an Hour, but he comes
back with a Gold Watch in his Hand; come, <HI>says
he,</HI> Why an't you ready? I am ready to go as
soon as you will; and with that he pulls out the
Gold Watch: I was amaz'd at such a Thing, as that
in a Country Town, but it seems there was
Prayers at one of the Churches in the Evening,
and he placing himself, as the Occasion directed,
found the way to be so near the Lady, as to get
it from her Side, and walk'd off with it unper∣ceived.</P>
<P>THE same Night we went away, by Moon∣light,
after having the Satisfaction to hear the
Watch cry'd, and ten Guineas offer'd for it again,
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
he would have been glad of the ten Guineas, in∣stead
of the Watch; but durst not venture to car∣ry
it home. Well, <HI>says I,</HI> you are afraid, and
but, you have Reason, give it me, I will ven∣ture
to carry it again; but he would not let
me; but told me, that when he came into <HI>Scotland</HI>
we might sell any thing there without Danger,
which was true indeed, for there they ask'd us no
Questions.</P>
<P>WE set out, <HI>as I said,</HI> in the Evening by Moon∣light,
and Travell'd hard, the Road being very
plain and large, till we came to <HI>Grantham,</HI> by
which time it was about two in the Morning, and
all the Town, as it were dead a sleep, so we went
on for <HI>Newark,</HI> where we reach'd about 8 in the
Morning, and there we lay down and slept most
of the Day, and by this sleeping so continually,
in the Day time, I kept him from doing a great
deal of Mischief, which he would otherwise have
done.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Newark,</HI> we took Advice of one that
was accidently comparing the Roads, and we con∣cluded
that the Road by <HI>Nottingham,</HI> would be
the best for us; so we turn'd out of the Great
Road, and went up the Side of the <HI>Trent</HI> to <HI>Not∣tingham:</HI>
Here he play'd his Pranks again in a man∣ner,
that it was the greatest wonder imaginable to
me, that he was not surpriz'd, and yet he came off
clear; and now he had got so many bulky Goods
that he bought him a Portmanteau to carry them
in: It was in vain for me to offer to restrain him
any more; so after this he went on his own way.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Nottingham, I say,</HI> he had such Success, that
made us the hastier to be going, than otherwise
we would have been, least we should have
been baulk'd, and should be laid hold of; from
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
Thence we left the Road, which leads to the
North again, and went away by <HI>Mansfield</HI> into
<HI>Scarsdale,</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL take up no more of my own Story,
with his Pranks, they very well merit to be told
by themselves; but I shall observe only what re∣lates
to our Journey. In a Word, I drag'd him
along as fast as I could, till I came to <HI>Leeds</HI> in
<HI>Torkshire,</HI> here tho' it be a large, and populous
Town, yet he could make nothing of it, neither had
he any Success at <HI>Wakefield;</HI> and he told me, in
short, that the North Country People were cer∣tainly
all Thieves: Why so? <HI>said I,</HI> The People
seem to be just as other People are; <HI>No, no,
says he,</HI> they have their Eyes so about them, and
are all so sharp, they look upon every Body that
comes near them to be a Pick-Pocket, or else they
would never stand, so upon their Guard; and
then again, <HI>says he,</HI> they are so poor, there is but
little to be got, and I am afraid, <HI>says he,</HI> the
farther we go North, we shall find it worse. Well,
<HI>said I,</HI> What do you infer from thence? I argue
from thence? <HI>says he,</HI> that we shall do nothing
there, and I had as good go back into the South,
and be hang'd, as into the North to be starv'd.</P>
<P>WELL, we came at length to <HI>New-Castle</HI> upon
<HI>Tyne.</HI> Here on a Market-day was a great Throng
of People, and several of the Towns-People go∣ing
to Market to buy Provisions, and here he
play'd his Pranks, cheated a Shopkeeper of 15 or
16 <HI>l.</HI> in Goods, and got clear away with them;
stole a Horse, and sold that he came upon, and
play'd so many Pranks, that I was quite frighted
for him; I say for him, for I was not concern'd for
myself, having never stirr'd out of the House
where I Lodg'd, at least not with him, nor with∣out
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
some or other with me, belonging to the <HI>Inn,</HI>
that might give an Account of me.</P>
<P>NOR did I use this Caution in vain, for he had
made himself so publick by his Rogueries, that he
was way-laid every where to be taken, and had he
not artfully at first given out, that he was come
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was going toward <HI>London,</HI> en∣quiring
that Road, and the like, which amus'd
his Pursuers for the first Day, he had been taken, and
in all probability had been hang'd there; but by
that Artifice he got half a Days time of them; and
yet as it was, he was put so to it, that he was fain
to plung Horse and all into the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> and
swim over, and thereby made his Escape: It was
true, that he was before upon <HI>Scots</HI> Ground, <HI>as
they call'd it,</HI> and consequently they had no power
to have carried him off, if any Body had op∣pos'd
them; yet as they were in a full Chase af∣ter
him, could they have come up with him, they
would have run the Risque of the rest, and they
cou'd but have deliver'd him up, if they had
been Questioned about it; however, as he got over
the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and was landed safe, they could nei∣ther
follow him, the Water being too High at the
usual Place of going over, nor could they have
attempted to have brought him away, if they had
taken him: The place where he took the River,
was where there is a <HI>Ford</HI> a little below <HI>Kelso,</HI> but
the Water being up, the <HI>Ford</HI> was not passable,
and he had no time to go to the <HI>Ferry-Boat,</HI> which
is about a Furlong off, opposite to the Town.</P>
<P>HAVING thus made his Escape, he went to
<HI>Kelso,</HI> where he had appointed me to come after
him.</P>
<P>I followed with a heavy Heart, expecting every
Hour to meet him upon the Road, in the Custody
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
of the Constables, and such People, or to hear
of him in the Goal; but when I came to a
Place on the Border, call'd <HI>Woller-haugh-head,</HI> there
I understood how he had been Chas'd, and how
he had made his Escape.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to <HI>Kelso,</HI> he was easie enough to
be found, for his having desperately swam the
<HI>Tweed,</HI> a rapid and large River, made him much
talk'd of, tho' it seems they had not heard of the
occasion of it, nor any thing of his Character; for
he had wit enough to conceal all that, and live as
retir'd as he could till I came to him.</P>
<P>I WAS not so much rejoyc'd at his Safety, as I
was provok'd at his Conduct; and the more, for
that I could not find he had yet the least Notion
of its having been void of common Sense with re∣spect
to his Circumstances, as well as contrary to
what he promis'd me; however, as there was no
beating any thing into his Head by Words, I only
told him, that I was glad he was at last gotten into
a Place of Safety, and I ask'd him then how he
intended to manage himself in that Country? He
said in few Words, he did not know yet, he doubt∣ed
the People were very poor; but if they had
any Money, he was resolv'd to have some of it.</P>
<P>BUT do you know too, <HI>says I,</HI> that they are the
severest People upon Criminals of your kind in
the World? he did not value that, <HI>he said,</HI> in
his blunt short way, he would venture it; upon
this, <HI>I told him,</HI> that seeing it was so, and he would
run such ventures, I would take my leave of him,
and be gone back to <HI>England:</HI> He seem'd Sullen, or
rather it was the roughness of his untractable Dis∣position;
he said I might do what I would, he
would do, as he found opportunity; however, we
did not Part immediately, but went on towards
the Capital City; on the Road we found too much
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
Poverty, and too few People to give him room to
expect any Advantage in his way, and tho' he
had his Eyes about him, as sharp as a Hawk, yet
he saw plainly there was nothing to be done;
for as to the Men, they did not seem to have
much Money about them; and for the Women,
their Dress was such, that they had any Mo∣ney,
or indeed any Pockets, it was impossible
to come at them; for wearing large Plads a∣bout
them, and down to their Knees, they were
wrap'd up so close, that there was no coming to
make the least attempt of that kind.</P>
<P><HI>Kelso,</HI> was indeed a good Town, and had abundance
of People in it, and yet tho' he staid one <HI>Sunday</HI>
there, and saw the Church, which is very large and
throug'd with People; yet as he told me, there
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not one Woman to be seen in all the Church
with any other Dress than a Plaid, except in two
Pews, which belong'd to some Noblemen, and
who when they came out, were so surrounded with
Footmen and Servants, that there was no com∣ing
near them, any more than there was any
coming near the King surrounded by his Guards.</P>
<P>WE set out therefore with this Discourage∣ment,
which I was secretly glad of, and went
forward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>Edinborough;</HI> all the way thither we
went thro' no considerable Town, and it was but
very course Travelling for us, who were Strangers,
for we met with Waters, which were very Dan∣gerous
to pass, by Reason of hasty Rains, at a Place,
call'd <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and where my Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain was really
in danger of drowning, his Horse being driven down
by the Stream, and fell under him, by which he
wetted and spoil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his stolen Goods, that he brought
from <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and which he had kept dry,
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
strangely by holding them up in his Arms, when he
swam the <HI>Tweed;</HI> but here it wanted but little, that
he and his Horse had been lost, not so much by the
depth of the Water, as the fury of the Current;
but he had a Porverb in his Favour, and he got
out of the Water, tho' with difficulty enough, not
being born to be drown'd, as I shall observe
afterwards in its Place.</P>
<P>WE came to <HI>Edinborough,</HI> the third Day from
<HI>Kelso,</HI> having stopp'd at an <HI>Inn</HI> one whole Day, at
a Place, call'd, <HI>Soutra-Hill,</HI> to dry our Goods,
and refresh our selves: We were oddly Saluted at
<HI>Edinborough,</HI> the next Day after we came thither;
My Captain having a desire to walk, and look a∣bout
him, ask'd me if I would go, and see the
Town? I told him yes; so we went out, and coming
thro'a Gate that they call the <HI>Nether-Bow</HI> into the
Great High-street, which went up to the <HI>Cross;</HI>
we were surpriz'd to see it throug'd with an in∣finite
Number of People: Ay, <HI>says my Captain,</HI>
this will do; however, as I had made him pro∣mise
to make no Adventures that Day, other∣wise,
I told him I would not got out with him;
so I held him by the sleeve, and would not let
him stir from me.</P>
<P>THEN we came up to the <HI>Mercart-Cross,</HI> and there
besides the great Number of People who pass'd,
and repass'd, we saw a great Parade or kind of
Meeting, like an <HI>Exchange,</HI> of Gentlemen, of all
Ranks, and Qualities, and this Encourag'd my
Captain again, and he pleas'd himself with that
Sight.</P>
<P>IT was while we were looking, and wonder∣ing
at what we saw here, that we were sur∣priz'd
with a Sight; which we little expected; we
observ'd the People running on a sudden, as to see
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
some strange Thing just coming along, and
strange it was indeed; for we see two Men na∣ked
from the Wast upwards, run by us as swift
as the Wind, and we imagin'd nothing, but that
it was two Men running a Race for some mighty
Wager; on a sudden, we found two long small
Ropes or Lines, which hung down at first pull'd
strait, and the two Racers stopp'd, and stood still,
one close by the other; we could not imagine
what this meant, but the Reader may judge at
our surprize when we found a Man follow after,
who had the ends of both those Lines in his Hands,
and who, when he came up to them, gave each of
them two frightful Lashes with a Wire-whip, or
Lash, which he held in the other Hand; and then
the two poor naked Wretches run on again to the
length of their Line or Tether, where they waited
for the like Salutation; and in this manner they
Danc'd the length of the whole Street, which is
about half a Mile.</P>
<P>THIS was a dark Prospect to my Captain, and
put him in Mind, not only of what he was to ex∣pect,
if he made a slip in the way of his Professi∣on,
in this Place; but also of what he had suffer'd,
when he was but a Boy; at the famous place,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all'd <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for as we saw the Execu∣tion,
so we were curious to Examine into the
Crime too; and we ask'd a young Fellow who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tood near us, what the two Men had done, for
which they suffer'd that Punishment. The Fel∣low,
an unhappy ill natur'd <HI>Scotch-man,</HI> perceiv'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y our Speech, that we were <HI>English-men;</HI> and by
our Question, that we were Strangers, told us with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> malicious Wit, that they were two <HI>English-men;</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that they were Whip'd so for Picking-pockets;
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
and other petty Thieveries, and that they were
afterwards to be sent away, over the Border into
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now this was every Word of it False, and was
only form'd by his nimble Invention, to insult
us as <HI>English-men;</HI> for when we enquir'd farther,
they were both <HI>Scotch-men,</HI> and were thus Scourg'd
for the usual Offences, for which we give the like
Punishment in <HI>England;</HI> and the Man who held
the Line, and Scourg'd them, was the City Hang∣man;
who (by the Way) is there an Officer of
Note, has a constant Sallary, and is a Man of
Substance, and not only so, but a most Dextrous
Fellow in his Office; and makes a great deal of
Money of his Employment.</P>
<P>THIS sight however, was very shocking to us;
and my Captain turn'd to me, come, <HI>says he,</HI> let
us go away? I won't stay here any longer; I was
glad to hear him say so, but did not think he had
meant or intended what he said: However, we
went back to our Quarters, and kept pretty much
within, only that in the Evenings we Walk'd a∣bout:
But even then my Captain found no Em∣ployment,
no Encouragement; two or three times
indeed, he made a Prize of some Mercery and Mil∣lenary
Goods: But when he had them, he knew
not what to do with them; so that in short, he
was forc'd to be honest, in spight of his good will,
to be otherwise.</P>
<P>WE remain'd here about a Month; when on a
sudden my Captain was gone, Horse and all, and
I knew nothing what was become of him; nor did
I ever see or hear of him for eighteen Months af∣ter,
nor did he so much as leave the least notice
for me; either, whether he was gone, or whether
he would return to <HI>Edinborough</HI> again, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="135"/>
I Took his leaving me very heiniously, not
knowing what to do with my self, being a
Stranger in the Place, and on the other Hand, my
Money abated a-pace too: I had for the most part
of this time, my Horse upon my Hands to keep;
and as Horses yield but a sorry Price in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
I found no Opportunity to make much of him;
and on the other Hand, I had a secret Resolution,
if I had gone back to <HI>England,</HI> to have restor'd him
to the Owner, at <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> by <HI>Ware;</HI> and so I
should have wrong'd him of nothing, but of the
use of him for so long time: But I found an Occa∣sion
to answer all my Designs, about the Horse
to Advantage.</P>
<P>THERE came a Man to the <HI>Stabler</HI> (so they call
the People at <HI>Edinborough,</HI> that take in Horses to
keep) and wanted to know if he could hear of any
return'd Horses for <HI>England;</HI> my Landlord (so we
call'd him) came bluntly to me one Day, and ask'd
me <HI>if my Horse was my own?</HI> it was an odd Questi∣on
as my Circumstances stood, and puzzl'd me at
first; and I ask'd him why, and what was the Mat∣ter?
Because, <HI>says he,</HI> if it be a hir'd Horse in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
as is often the Case with <HI>English</HI> Men, who
come to <HI>Scotland,</HI> I could help you to send it
back, and get you something for riding it, so he
express'd himself.</P>
<P>I WAS very glad of the Occasion; and in short,
took Security there of the Person, for delivering
the Horse safe and sound, and had 15 <HI>s. Sterling</HI>
for the riding him: Upon this Agreement I gave
order to leave the Horse at the <HI>Falcon</HI> at <HI>Puckeridge,</HI>
and where I heard many Year after, that he was
honestly left, and that the Owner had him again,
but had nothing for the Loan of him.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136"/>
BEING thus eas'd of the Expence of my Horse,
and having nothing at all to do; I began to consi∣der
with myself, what would become of me, and
what I could turn my Hand to: I had not much
diminish'd my Stock of Money for tho' I was
all the way so wary, that I would not Joyn
with my Captain in his desperate Attempts, yet
I made no scruple to live at his Expence, which
as I came out of <HI>England,</HI> only to keep him Com∣pany
had been but just, had I not known that all
he had to spend upon me, was what he robb'd
honest People off, and that I was all that while a
Receiver of stolen Goods; but I was not come off
so far than as to scruple that Part at all.</P>
<P>IN the the next Place, I was not so anxious a∣bout
my Money runing low, because, I knew
what a Reserve I had made at <HI>London;</HI> but still
I was very willing to have engag'd in any honest
Employment for a Livelihood; for I was Sick
indeed of the wandering Life which I had led,
and was resolv'd to Thieve no more; but then
two or three things, which I had offer'd me, I
lost, because I could not Write or Read.</P>
<P>THIS afflicted me a great while very much,
but the <HI>Stabler,</HI> as I have call'd him deliver'd me
from my Anxiety that way, by bringing me to an
honest, but a poor young Man, who undertook to
teach me, both to Write and Read, and in a little
time too, and for a small Expence, if I would take
pains at it; I promised all possible Diligence and
to Work, I went with it; but found the Writing
much more difficult to me than the Reading.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in Half a Years time, or there∣abouts;
I could Read and Write too tollerably
well, insomuch, that I began to think I was now
fit for Business, and I got by it into the Service of
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
a certain Officer of the Customs, who employed
me for a time, but as he set me to do little, but
pass and repass between <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinborough,</HI>
with the Accounts which he kept for the Farmers
of the Customs there, leaving me to live at my
own Expence, till my Wages should be due, I
run out the little Money I had left, in Cloths
and Subsistance, and a little before, the Years
End, when I was to have 12 <HI>l. English</HI> Money,
truly my Master was turn'd out of his Place, and
which was worse, having been Charged with some
Mis-applications, was oblig'd to take Shelter in
<HI>England,</HI> and so we that were Servants, for
there were three of us, were lest to shift for
ourselves.</P>
<P>THIS was a hard Case for me, in a strange
Place, and I was reduc'd by it, to the last Extre∣mity:
I might have gone for <HI>England,</HI> an <HI>English</HI>
Ship being there, the Master profer'd me to give
me my passage (upon telling him my distress) and
to take my Word, for the Payment of 10 <HI>s.</HI> when I
came there; but my Captain appear'd just then un∣der
new Circumstances which oblig'd him not to go
away, and I was loth to leave him; it seems we
were yet farther to take our Fate together.</P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd, that he left me, and that
I saw him, no more for Eighteen Months: His
Ramble, and Adventures were many in that
time, he went to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> play'd some re∣markable
Pranks there, escap'd almost Miracu∣lously
from the Gallows, got over to <HI>Ireland,</HI>
wander'd about there, turn'd Raparee, and did some
villanious Things there, and escap'd from <HI>London-Derry,</HI>
over to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> in the North of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and about a Month before I was left
destitute at <HI>Leith,</HI> by my Master; behold! my
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
Noble Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> came in there, on Board the
Ferry-Boat, from <HI>Fise,</HI> being after all his Ad∣ventures,
and Successes advanc'd to the Dignity
of a Foot-Soldier, in a Body of Recruits rais'd in
the North, for the Regiment of <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER my Disaster, being reduc'd almost as
low, as my Captain, I found no better Shift be∣fore
me, at least for the present, than to enter
myself a Soldier too, and thus we were Rank'd
together, with each of us a Musquet upon our
Shoulders, and I confess that thing did not fit
so ill upon me, as I thought at first it would
have done; for tho' I far'd Hard, and lodg'd Ill,
for the last especially, is the Fate of poor Sol∣diers
in that Part of the World; yet to me, that
had been us'd to Lodge on the Ashes in the
Glass-House, this was no great matter; I had
a secret Satisfaction at being now under no Ne∣cessity
of stealing, and living in fear of a Prison,
and of the lash of the Hangman; a thing which
from the time, I saw it in <HI>Edinborough,</HI> was so ter∣rible
to me, that I could not think of it without
horror, and it was an inexpressible ease to my
Mind, that I was now in a certain way of
Living, which was honest, and which I could
say, was not unbecoming a Gentleman.</P>
<P>WHATEVER, was my Satisfaction in that
Part, yet other Circumstances did not equally
concur to make this Life suit me; for after we had
been about Six Months in this Figure, we were
inform'd that the Recruits were all to march for
<HI>England,</HI> and to be shipp'd off at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> or at
<HI>Hull,</HI> to join the Regiment which was then in
<HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>I should tell you that before this, I was ex∣treamly
delighted with the Life of a Soldier; and

I took the Exercise so naturally, that the Serje∣ant
that taught us to handle our Arms, se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing me
so ready at it, ask'd me if I had never carryed
Arms before; I told him n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, at which he swore,
tho' Jesting they call you Col <HI>says he,</HI> and I be∣lieve
you will be a Col. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you must be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Co∣lon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l's
Bastard, or you would never handle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Arms as you do, at once or twice showing.</P>
<P>THIS pleas'd me extreamly, and encourag'd me,
and I was mightily taken with the Life of a Sol∣dier;
but when my Captain came, and told me
the News, that we were to march for <HI>England,</HI>
and to be shipp'd off for <HI>Flanders</HI> at <HI>New-Castle</HI>
upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> I was surpriz'd very much, and new
Thoughts began to come in my Mind; as first,
my Captain's Condition was particular, for he
durst not appear publickly at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> as he
must have done if he had march'd with the Bat∣talion
(for they were a Body of above 400, and
therefore, call'd themselves a Battalion, tho' they
were but Recruits, and belonged to the several
Companies abroad) <HI>I say,</HI> he must have march'd
with them, and been publickly seen, in which
Case he would have been apprehended, and de∣livered
up: In the next Place, I remember'd that
I had almost a Hundred Pound in Money in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and if it should have been ask'd, all the Sol∣diers
in the Regiment which of them would go to
<HI>Flanders,</HI> a private Centinel if they had a 100 <HI>l.</HI>
in their Pockets, I believ'd none of them would
answer in the affirmative; a Hundred Pound be∣ing
at that time sufficient to buy a Colours in any
New Regiment, tho' not in that Regiment which
was on an old Establishment: This whetted
my Ambition, and I Dream't of nothing but be∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
a Gentleman Officer, as well as a Gentleman
Soldier.</P>
<P>THESE two Circumstances concurring. I be∣gan
to be very uneasy, and very unwilling in
my Thoughts to go over a poor Musquetier into
<HI>Flanders,</HI> to be knock'd on the Head at the Tune
of Three and Six-pence a Week: While I was day∣ly
musing on the Circumstances of being sent a∣way,
as above, and considering what to do, my
Captain comes to me one Evening; Hark ye, <HI>Jack,
says he?</HI> I must speak with you, let us take a
walk in the Fields a little out from the Houses;
we were Quarter'd at a Place, call'd <HI>Park-End,</HI> near
the Town of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> about 20 Miles from <HI>Ber∣wick</HI>
upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and about Sixteen Miles from
the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> the nearest way.</P>
<P>WE walk'd together here, and talk'd seriously up∣on
the matter; the Captain told me how his Case
stood, and that he durst not march with the Bat∣talion
into <HI>New-Castle;</HI> that if he did, he should
be taken out of the Ranks, and tryed for his Life,
and that I knew as well as he; I could go private∣ly
to <HI>New-Castle, says he,</HI> and go thro' the Town
well enough, but to go publickly, is to run into
the Jaws of Destruction: <HI>Well,</HI> says I, <HI>that
is very true, but what will you do?</HI> Do! says
he, <HI>do you think I am so bound by honour, as a Gen∣tleman
Soldier, that I will be hang'd for them,</HI> no,
no, <HI>says he,</HI> I am resolv'd to be gone; and I would
have you go with us: <HI>said I,</HI> What do you
mean by us? why, here is another honest Fellow,
an <HI>English</HI> Man also, <HI>says he,</HI> that is resolv'd to
Desert too, and he has been a long while in
their Service, and says, he knows how we shall
be us'd Abroad, and he will not go to <HI>Flanders,
says he,</HI> not he.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141"/>
WHY, <HI>says I,</HI> you will be shot to Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for
Deserters if you are taken; and they will send
out Scouts for you in the Morning all over the
Country, so that you will certainly fall into their
Hands; as for that, <HI>says he,</HI> my Comrade is
thoroughly acquainted with the Way; and has un∣dertaken
to bring us to the Bank of <HI>Tweed,</HI> before
they can come up with us, and when we are on
the other side of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> they can't take us up.</P>
<P>AND when would you go away <HI>says I?</HI></P>
<P>THIS Minute, <HI>says he,</HI> no time to be lost; 'tis
a fine Moon-shining Night.</P>
<P>I have none of my Baggage, <HI>says I,</HI> let me go
back and fetch my Linnen, and other things.</P>
<P>YOUR Linnen is not much, I suppose, <HI>says he,</HI>
and we shall easily get more in <HI>England</HI> the old
Way.</P>
<P>No, <HI>says I,</HI> no more of your old Ways; it has
been owing to those old Ways, that we are now
in such a strait.</P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>says he,</HI> the old Ways are better
than this starving Life of a Gentleman, as we
call it.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>says I,</HI> we have no Money in our Pockets;
how shall we Travel?</P>
<P>I have a little, <HI>says the Captain,</HI> enough to help
us on to <HI>New-Castle;</HI> and if we can get none by
the Way, we will get some Collier Ship to take
us in, and carry us to <HI>London</HI> by Sea.</P>
<P>I like that the best of all the Measures you have
laid yet, <HI>said I,</HI> and so I consented to go, and went
off with him immediately: The cunning Rogue
having lodg'd his Comrade a Mile off under the
Hills, had drag'd me, talking with him by little
and little that way; till just when I consented,
he was in sight, and he said, look there's my Com∣rade;
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
who I knew presently, having seen him a∣mong
the Men.</P>
<P>BEING thus gotten under the Hills, and a Mile
of the way, and the Day just shot in, we kept on
a pace; resolving if possible to get out of the reach
of our Pursue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, before they should miss us, or
know any thing of our being gone.</P>
<P>WE ply'd our time so well, and travell'd so
hard; that by five a Clock in the Morning we
were at a little Village, whose Name I forget:
But they told us, that we were within eight Miles
of the <HI>Tweed;</HI> and that as soon as we should be
over the River, we were on <HI>English</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>WE refresh'd a little here, but march'd on with
but little stay; however, it was half an Hour past
eight in the Morning before we reach'd the <HI>Tweed;</HI>
so it was at least twelve Miles, when they told us
it was but Eight: Here we overtook two more of
the same Regiment who had Deserted from <HI>Had∣dingtown;</HI>
where another part of the Recruits were
quarter'd.</P>
<P>THOSE were <HI>Scots-men,</HI> and very Poor, having
not one Penny in their Pockets; and had no more
when they made their Escape, but 8s. between
them; and when they see us, who they knew to
be of the same Regiment, they took us to be Pur∣suers,
and that we came to lay hold of them; upon
which they stood upon their Defence, having the
Regiment Swords on, as we had also, but none of
the Mounting or Cloathing; for we were not to
receive the Cloathing, till we came to the Regi∣ment
in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not long before we made them under∣stand,
that we were in the same Circumstances with
themselves, and so we soon became one Company;
and after resting some time on the <HI>English</HI> side of
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
the River, (for we were heartily tyr'd, and the other
were as much Fateagu'd as we were;) I say, after
resting a while, we set forward towards <HI>New Castle,</HI>
whether we resolv'd to go to get our Passage by
Sea to <HI>London;</HI> for we had not Money to hold us
out any farther.</P>
<P>OUR Money was Ebb'd very Low, for tho' I
had one piece of Gold in my Pocket, which I kept
reserv'd for the last Extremity; yet it was but
half a Guinea, and my Captain had born all our
Charges as far as his Money would go; so that
when we came to <HI>New Castle,</HI> we had but Six-pence
left in all to help ourselves; and the two <HI>Scots</HI>
had begg'd their way, all along the Road.</P>
<P>WE contriv'd to come into <HI>New-Castle</HI> in the
Dusk of the Evening; and even then we durst not
venture into the publick Part of the Town, but
made down towards the River, something below the
Town where some <HI>Glass-houses</HI> stand: Here we knew
not what to do with ourselves; but Guided by our
Fate, we put a good Face upon the Matter, and
went into an <HI>Ale-house,</HI> sat down and call'd for a
Pint of Beer.</P>
<P>THE House was kept by a Woman only, <HI>that is
to say</HI> We saw no other, and as she appear'd very
Frank, and Entertain'd us Cheerfully, we at last
told her our Condition; and ask'd her, if she cou'd
not help us to some kind Master of a Collier, that
would give us a Passage to <HI>London</HI> by Sea; the
Subtil Devil, who immediately found us proper
Fish for her Hock, gave us the kindest Words in
the World; and told us, she was heartily sorry she
had not seen us one Day sooner; that there was a
Collier Master of her particular Acquaintance that
went away, but with the Morning-Tide; that the
Ship was fallen down to <HI>Shields,</HI> but she believ'd
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
was hardly over the Bar yet, and she would
send to his House, and see if he was gone on Board,
for sometimes the Masters do not go away till a
Tide after the Ship, and she was sure if he was
not gone, she cou'd prevail with him to take us
all in; but then she was afraid we must go on
Board immediately the same Night.</P>
<P>WE begg'd of her to send to his House, for we
knew not what to do, and if she cou'd oblige
him to take us on Board, we did not care what
time of Night it was▪ for as we had no Money,
we had no Lodging, and we wanted nothing, but
to be on Board.</P>
<P>WE look'd upon this as a mighty Favour, that she
sent to the Master's House; and to our greater Joy,
she brought us Word about an Hour after, that he
was not gone, and was at a Tavern in the Town,
whether his Boy had been to fetch him; and that
he had sent Word he would call there in the way
Home.</P>
<P>THIS was all in our Favour, and we were ex∣treamly
pleas'd with it; about an Hour after the
Landlady being in the Room with us, her Maid
brings us Word the Master was below, so down
she goes to him, telling us she would go and tell
him our Case, and see to perswade him to take us
all on Board; after some time, she comes up with
him, and brings him into the Room to us; where
are these honest Gentlemen Soldiers, <HI>says he,</HI> that
are in such Distress? We stood all up and paid our
Respects to him; Well, Gentlemen, and is all
your Money spent?</P>
<P>INDEED it is, <HI>said one of our Company;</HI> and we
shall be infinitely obliged to you, Sir, if you
will give us a Passage, we will be very willing
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
to do any thing we can in the Ship, though we
are not Seamen.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says he,</HI> were none of you ever at Sea in
your Lives?</P>
<P>NO, <HI>says we,</HI> not one of us.</P>
<P>YOU will be able to do me no Service then,
<HI>says he,</HI> for you will be all Sick: Well, however,
<HI>says he,</HI> for my good Landlady's sake, <HI>here I'll do
it:</HI> But are you all ready to go on Board, for I
go on Board this very Night?</P>
<P>YES, Sir, <HI>says we</HI> again, we are ready to go
this Minute.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says he,</HI> very kindly, we'll Drink to∣gether;
come Landlady, <HI>says he,</HI> make these ho∣nest
Gentlemen a Sneaker of Punch.</P>
<P>WE look'd at one another, for we knew we had
no Money, and he perceiv'd it; come, come, <HI>says
he,</HI> don't be concern'd at your having no Money,
my Landlady here, and I, never part with dry
Lips: Come good Wife, <HI>says he,</HI> make the Punch
as I bid you.</P>
<P>WE thank'd him, and said, God Bless you No∣ble
Captain, a hundred times over; being over∣joy'd
with such good Luck: While we were Drink∣ing
the Punch, he calls the Landlady, come,
<HI>says he,</HI> I'll step Home, and take my things,
and bid them Good-bye, and order the Boat to
come at high Water and take me up here; and
pray good Wife, <HI>says he,</HI> get me something for
Supper, sure if I can give these honest Men their
Passage, I may give them a Bit of Victuals too,
it may be they han't had much for Dinner.</P>
<P>WITH this away he went, and in a little while
we heard the Jack a going; and one of us going
down Stairs for a Spye, brought us Word there
was a good Leg of Mutton at the Fire: In less than
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
an Hour our Captain came again, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
to us, and blam'd us that we had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
the Punch out; come, <HI>says he,</HI> don't be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
when that's out we can have another, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
am obliging poor Men, I love to do it hand∣somely.</P>
<P>WE drank on, and drank the Punch out, and
more was brought up, and he push'd it about a
pace; then came up a Leg of Mutton, and I
need not say that we eat heartily, being told se∣veral
times, that we should pay nothing; after
Supper was done, he bids my Landlady ask if the
Boat was come? and she brought word no, it was
not High Water by a good deal; no, <HI>says he,</HI> well
then give us some more Punch, so more Punch
was brought in, and, as was afterwards confess'd
something was put into it, or more Brandy than
ordinary, that by that time the Punch was drunk
out, we were all very Drunk, and as for me I was
asleep.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time that was out, we were told
the Boat was come, so we tumbl'd out, almost o∣ver
one another into the Boat, and away we
went, and our Captain with us in the Boat; most of
us, if not all, fell asleep; till after sometime, tho'
how, much or how far going we knew not, the
Boat stopp'd, and we were wak'd, and told we
were at the Ship side; which was true, and with
much help and holding us, for fear we should
fall over Board, we were all gotten into the Ship;
all I remember of it was this, that as soon as we
were on Board, our Captain, as we call'd him,
call'd out thus, here Boatson take care of these
Gentlemen, and give them good Cabbins, and
let them turn in and go to sleep, for they are
very weary; and so indeed we were, and very
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
Drunk too, being the first time I had ever drank
and Punch in my Life.</P>
<P>WELL, care was taken of us, according to or∣der,
and we were put into very good Cabbius,
where we were sure to go immediately to sleep; in
the mean time the Ship, which was indeed just
ready to go, and only on notice given, had come to
an Anchor for us at <HI>Shields,</HI> weigh'd, stood over the
Bar, and went off to Sea, and when we wak'd,
and began to peep abroad, which was not till near
Noon; the next Day we found ourselves a great
way at Sea, the Land in sight indeed, but at a
great distance, and all going merrily on for <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
as we understood it; we were very well us'd,
and well satisfy'd with our Condition for about
three Days, when we began to enquire whether we
were not almost come, and how much longer it
would be, before we should come into the River?
What River? <HI>says one of the Men,</HI> why, the <HI>Thames,</HI>
says my Captain <HI>Jack;</HI> the <HI>Thames,</HI> says the Sea∣men,
What do ye mean by that? What han't you
had time enough to be sober yet? so Captain
<HI>Jack</HI> said no more, but look'd about him like a
Fool, when a while after, some other of us ask'd
the like Question, and the Seamen, who knew no∣thing
of the Cheat, began to smell a Trick,
and turning to the other <HI>Englishman</HI> that came
with us, pray, <HI>says he,</HI> Where do you fancy you
are going, that you ask so often about it? why to
<HI>London,</HI> says he, where should we be going? we
agreed with the Captain to carry us to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>NOT with the Captain, <HI>says he,</HI> I dare say; poor
Men, you are all cheated; and I thought so when I
saw you come Aboard with that Kidnapping Rogue
<HI>Gilliman;</HI> poor Men! <HI>adds he,</HI> you are all Betray'd,
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
Why, you are going to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the Ship is
bound to <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Englishman</HI> falls a storming, and raving like
a mad Man, and we gathering round him, let any
Men guess if they can, what was our surprise, and
how we were confounded when we were told how
it was; in short, we drew our Swords, and began
to lay about us, and made such a Noise, and
Hurry in the Ship, that at last the Seamen
were obliged to call out for help; the Captain
commanded us to be disarmed in the first
Place, which was not however done without gi∣ving,
and receiving some Wounds, and after∣wards
he caus'd us to be brought to him into the
great Cabbin.</P>
<P>HERE he talk'd calmly to us, that he was
really very sorry, for what had befallen us, that
he perceiv'd we had been Trappan'd, and that the
Fellow, who had brought us on Board was a
Rogue that was employ'd by a sort of wicked
Merchants, not unlike himself; that he suppos'd
he had been represented to us, as Captain of the
Ship, and ask'd us if it was not so? we told him
yes, and gave him a large Account of ourselves,
and how we came to the Woman's House to en∣quire
for some Master of a <HI>Collier</HI> to get a Passage
to <HI>London,</HI> and that this Man engag'd to carry us
to <HI>London</HI> in his own Ship, and the like, as is re∣lated
above.</P>
<P>HE told us he was very sorry for it, and he
had no hand it; but it was out of his Power to
help us, and let us know very plainly what our
Condition was; namely, that we were put on
Board his Ship as Servants to be deliver'd at <HI>Ma∣ryland,</HI>
to such a Man, who he named to us; but
that however if we would be quiet, and orderly
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
in the Ship, he would use us well in the Passage,
and take care we should be us'd well when we
came there, and that he would do any thing for
us that lay in his Power; but if we were un∣ruly
and refractory we could not expect but he
must take such Measures as to oblige us to be sa∣tisfied;
and that in short, we must be Hand-cuffed,
carried down between the Decks, and kept as
Prisoners, for it was his Business to take care that
no Disturbance must be in the Ship.</P>
<P>MY Captain rav'd like a mad Man; swore at
the Captain, told him he would not fail to cut
his Throat either on Board, or a Shore, whenever he
came within his reach, and that if he could
not do it now, he would do it after he came
to <HI>England</HI> again, if ever he durst show his
Face here again, for he might depend upon it, if
he was carryed away to <HI>Virginia,</HI> he should find
his way to <HI>England</HI> again; that if it was 20
Year after, he would have Satisfaction of him:
Well, young Man, <HI>says the Captain smiling,</HI> 'tis
very honestly said, and than I must take care of
you while I have you here; and afterwards, I
must take care of my self; do your worst, <HI>says
Jack boldly,</HI> I'll pay you home for it one time or
other; I must venture that young Man, says he
still, calmly, but for the present you and I must
talk a little; so he bids the Boatswain, who stood
near him, secure him, which he did; I spoke to
him to be easie and patient, and that the Captain
had no Hand in our Misfortune.</P>
<P>NO Hand in it! D—m him, <HI>said he,</HI> aloud, do
you think he is not Confederate in this Villainy?
Would any honest Man receive Innocent People
on Board his Ship, and not enquire of their
Circumstances, but carry them away, and not
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
speak to them? and now he knows how Barbarously
we are treated; Why does he not set us on Shore
again? I tell you he is the Villiain, and none but
him; Why does he not compleat his Villainy, and
Murther us, and then he will be free from our Re∣venge?
But nothing else shall ever deliver him
from my Hands; but sending us to the D—1, or
going thither himself; and I am honester in tel∣ling
him so fairly, than he has been to me, and
am in no Passion any more than he is.</P>
<P>THE Captain was a little shock'd at his bold∣ness,
for he talk'd a great deal more of the same
Kind; with a great deal of Spirit, and Fire, and
yet, without any Disorder in his Temper; indeed
I was surpriz'd at it, for I never had heard him
talk so well, and so much to the Purpose in my
Life: The Captain was, <HI>I say,</HI> a little shock'd at
it; however, he talk'd very handsomely to him,
and told him, look ye, young Man, I bear with
you the more, because I am sensible your Case is
very hard, and yet, I cannot allow your Threat∣ning
me neither; and you oblige me by that, to
be severer with you than I intended; however, I
will do nothing to you, but what your Threatning
my Life makes necessary: The Boatswain call'd
out to have him to the Geers, as they call'd it,
and to have him Tast the <HI>Cat-a-nine-tales;</HI> all
which were Terms we did not understand till af∣terwards,
we were told he should have been
Whipp'd and Pickl'd, for they said it was not to
be suffer'd; but the Captain said, no, no, the
young Man has been really Injur'd, and has Rea∣son
to be very much provok'd: But I have not
Injur'd him, <HI>says he,</HI> and then he protested he had
no Hand in it; that he was put on Board, and we
also by the Owner's Agent, and for their Account;
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
That it was true, that they did always deal in
Servants, and carryed a great many every Voy∣age;
but that it was no profit to him as Com∣mander,
but they were always put on Board by
the Owners, and that it was none of his Business
to enquire about them, and to prove that he was
not concern'd in it, but was very much troubled
at so base a thing, and that he would not be In∣strumental
to carry us away against our Wills,
if the Wind and the Weather would permit, he
would set us on shore again, tho' as it blow'd then,
the Wind being at South-West, and a hard Gale,
and that they were already as far as the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> it
was impossible.</P>
<P>BUT the Captain was the same Man; he told him,
that let the Wind blow how it would, he ought not
to carry us away against our consents, and that
as to his Pretences of his Owners, and the like
it was saying of nothing to him; for it was he the
Captain that carryed us away, and that whatever
Rogue Trappan'd us on Board, now he knew it, he
ought no more to carry us away, than Murther us,
and that he demanded to be set on Shore, or else
he the Captain was a Thief, and a Murtherer.</P>
<P>THE Captain continu'd mild still, and then I
put in with an Argument, that had like to have
brought us all back, if the Weather had not real∣ly
hindered it; which when I came to understand
Sea Affairs better, I found was indeed so, and that
had been impossible. I told the Captain that I
was sorry that my Brother was so warm, but
that our usuage was Villainous, which he could
not deny; then I took np the air of what my
Habit did not agree with, I told him, that were
not People to be sold for Slaves, that tho' we
had the Misfortune to be in a Circumstance that
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
oblig'd us to conceal ourselves, having disguised
ourselves to get out of the Army, as being not wil∣ling
to go into <HI>Flanders;</HI> yet, that we were Men
of Substance, and able to Discharge ourselves
from the Service, when it came to that, and to con∣vince
him of it, I told him I would give him suffi∣cient
Security, to pay 20<HI>l.</HI> a piece, for my Brother
and my self; and in as short time as we could
send, from the Place he should put in at <HI>London,</HI>
and receive a Return; and to show that I was able
to do it, I pull'd out my Bill for 94<HI>l.</HI> from the
Gentleman of the Custom-House, and who to my
infinite Satisfaction, he knew as soon as he saw
the Bill; he was astonish'd at this, and lifting up
his Hands, by what Witchcraft, <HI>says he,</HI> were you
brought hither!</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>says I,</HI> we have told you the Story,
and we add nothing to it, but we insist upon it,
that you will do this Justice to us now: Well,
<HI>says he,</HI> I am very sorry for it, but I cannot an∣swer
puting back the Ship; neither if I could, <HI>says
he,</HI> is it Practicable to be done.</P>
<P>WHILE this Discourse lasted, the two <HI>Scots∣men,</HI>
and the other <HI>Englishman,</HI> were silent, but as
I seem'd to Acquiesce, the <HI>Scotchsmen,</HI> began to
talk to the same purpose, which I need not re∣peat,
and had not mention'd, but for a merry
Passage that followed; after the <HI>Scotchsmen</HI> had said
all they could, and the Captain still told them
they must submit; And will you then carry us
to <HI>Virginia? Yes, says</HI> the Captain, and will we
be sold sayd the <HI>Scotsman,</HI> when we come
there? Yes, <HI>says the Captain;</HI> Why, then, Sir, says
the <HI>Scotsman</HI> the Devil will have you at the
hnider End of the Bargain; <HI>say you so,</HI> says
the Captain smiling, well, well, <HI>let the De∣vil
and I alone to agree about that,</HI> do you be
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
quiet and behave Civilly as you should do, and
you shall be us'd as kindly both here, and there
too as I can: The poor <HI>Scotchsmen</HI> could say little
to it, nor I, nor any of us; for we saw there was
no Remedy, but to leave the Devil, and the Cap∣tain
to agree among themselves, as the Captain
had said as to the honesty of it.</P>
<P>THUS, in short, we were all, <HI>I say,</HI> oblig'd to
Acquiesce; but my Captain, who was so much
the more obstinate when he found that I had a
Fund to make such an offer upon, nor could all my
perswasions prevail with him: The Captain of the
Ship and he had many pleasant Dialogues about
this in the rest of the Voyage, in which <HI>Jack</HI> never
treated him with any Language, but that of Kid∣napper,
and Villain, nor talk'd of any thing,
but of taking his Revenge of him; but I omit
that Part tho' very Diverting as being no part of
my own Story.</P>
<P>IN short, the Wind continu'd to blow hard,
tho' very fair, till, as the Seamen said, we were
pass'd the Islands, on the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
that we began to Steer away Westerly, and then
in a few Days, (which I came to understand since)
as there was no Land any way, for many Hundred
Leagues, so we had no Remedy but Patience,
and to be as easy as we could; only my surly Cap∣tain
<HI>Jack</HI> continued the same Man all the way.</P>
<P>WE had a very good Voyage, no Storms all
the way, and a Northerly Wind almost 20
Days together; so that in a Word, we made the
Capes of <HI>Virginia</HI> in two and Thirty Days, from
the Day we steer'd West, as I have said which was
in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, 30 Minutes; be∣ing
to the North of the Isle of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and
this they said was a very quick Passage.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154"/>
NOTHING material happen'd to me, during the
Voyage, and indeed when I came there I was ob∣lig'd
to act in so naarrow a Compass, that nothing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> material could Present it self.</P>
<P>WHEN we came a shore, which was in a great
River, which they call <HI>Potomack,</HI> the Captain
ask'd us, but me more particularly, whether I
had any thing to propose to him now? <HI>Jack</HI> an∣sw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd
<HI>yes, I have something to propose to you</HI> Cap∣tam;
that is, that I have promis'd you to cut
your Throat, and depend upon it I will be as good
as my Word: Well, well, <HI>says the Captain,</HI> If I
can't help it you shall; so he turn'd away to me,
I understood him very well what he meant; but
I was now out of the reach of any Relief, and
as for my Note it was now but a bit of Paper of
no value, for no Body could receive it but my∣self:
I saw no Remedy, and so talk'd coldly to him
of it, as of a thing I was indifferent about; and
indeed I was grown indifferent, for I considered all
the way on the Voyage, that as I was bred a Vaga∣bond,
had been a Pick-pocket, and a Soldier, and
was run from my Colours, and that I had no settled
Abode in the World, nor any Employ to get
any thing by, except that wicked one I was bred
to, which had the Gallows at the Heels of it; I
did not see, but that this Service might be as well
to me as other Business; and this I was parti∣cularly
satisfied with when they told me, that af∣ter
I had Served out the five Years Servitude, I
should have the Courtisie of the Country, <HI>as they
call'd it;</HI> that is a certain Quantity of Land to
Cultivate and Plant for myself; so that now I
was like to be brought up to something, by which
I might live without that wretched thing, call'd
stealing; which my very Soul abhorr'd, and
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
which I had given over, as I have said ever since
that wicked time, that I robb'd the poor Widow
of <HI>Kentish</HI> Town.</P>
<P>IN this Mind I was, when I arriv'd at <HI>Virginia,</HI>
and so when the Captain enquired of me what I
intended to do, and whether I had any thing to
propose, <HI>that is to say,</HI> he meant whether I would
give him my Bill, which he wanted to be Finger∣ing
very much; I answer'd coldly, my Bill would
be of no use to me now, for no Body would ad∣vance
any thing upon it, only this I would say to
him, that if he would carry me and Captain
<HI>Jack</HI> back to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London</HI> again, I would
pay him the 20 <HI>l.</HI> off of my Bill for each of us:
This he had no mind to; <HI>for as to your Brother,</HI>
says he, <HI>I would not take him into my Ship for twice</HI>
20 l. <HI>he is such a hardened desperate Villain,</HI> says
he, <HI>I should be oblig'd to carry him in Irons as I
brought him hither.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we parted with our Captain, <HI>or Kidnap∣per,
call him as you will:</HI> We were then deliver'd
to the Merchants, to whom we were Consign'd,
who again dispos'd of us as they thought fit, and
in a few Days we were separated.</P>
<P>As for my Captain <HI>Jack,</HI> to make short of the
Story, that desperate Rogue had the Luck to have
a very easie good Master; whose E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siness, and good
Humour he abus'd very much, and in particular,
took an Opportunity to run away with a Boar,
which his Master entrusted him and another wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,
to carry some Provisions down the River to ano∣ther
Plantation, which he had there: This Boar,
and Provisions they ran away with, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
North to the bottom of the Bay, <HI>as they call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and
into a River, call'd <HI>Sasquehanuagh,</HI> and there quit∣ting
the Boat, they wandered thro' the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds,
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
till they came into <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> from whence they
made shift to get Passage to <HI>New-England,</HI> and
from thence Home; where falling in among his old
Companions, and to the old Trade; he was at
length taken and hang'd, about a Month before I
came to <HI>London,</HI> which was near 20 Year after∣ward.</P>
<P>MY Part was harder at the Beginning, tho'
better at the latter End; I was dispos'd of, <HI>that
is to say,</HI> sold, to a rich Planter, whose Name was
<HI>Smith,</HI> and with me, the other <HI>Englishman,</HI> who
was my Fellow Deser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, that <HI>Jack</HI> brought
me to when we went off from <HI>Dunbar.</HI></P>
<P>WE were now Fellow Servan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and it was our
Lot to be carrved up a small River or Creek,
which falls into <HI>Potowmack</HI> River, about eight Miles
from the great River: Here we were brought to
the Plantation, and put in among about 50 Ser∣vants,
as well <HI>Negroes,</HI> as others, and being de∣livered
to the Head-man, or Director, or Man∣nager
of the Plantation, he took care to let us
know that we must expect to Work, and very hard
too; for it was for that Purpose his Master bought
Servants, and for no other: I told him very sub∣missively,
that since it was our Misfortune to
come into such a miserable Condition as we were
in, we expected no other; only we desir'd, we
might be show'd our Business, and be allowed to
learn it gradually, since he might be sure we had
not been us'd to Labour; and I added that when he
knew particularly by what Methods we were
brought, and betrayed into such a Condition, he
would perhaps see Cause, at least to shew us that
Favour, if not more: This I spoke with such a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oving Tone, as gave him a Curiosity to enquire
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
into the particulars of our Story, which I gave
him at large, a little more to our Adavntage too,
than ordinary.</P>
<P>THIS Story as I hop'd it would, did move
him to a sort of Tenderness, but yet he told us
that his Master's Business must be done, and that
he expected we must Work, as above; that he
could not dispense with that, upon any account
whatever; accordingly to Work we went, and
indeed we had three hard Things attending us;
namely, we work'd Hard, lodg'd Hard, and far'd
Hard; the first I had been an utter Stranger to,
the last I could shift well enough with.</P>
<P>DURING this Scene of Life, I had time to
reflect on my past Hours, and upon what I had
done in the World, and tho' I had no great Ca∣pacity
of making a clear Judgment, and very
little reflections from Conscience, yet it made some
impressions upon me; and particularly that I was
brought into this miserable Condition of a Slave;
by some strange directing Power, as a Punish∣ment
for the Wickedness of my younger Years,
and this thought was increas'd upon the following
occasion: The Master whose Service I was now
gaged in, was a Man of Substance and Figure
in the Country, and had abundance of Ser∣vants,
as well as <HI>Negroes,</HI> as <HI>English;</HI> in all I think
he had near 200, and among so many, as some
grew every Year infirm and unable to Work, o∣thers
went off upon their time being expir'd, and
others died; and by these and other Accidents the
Number would diminish, if they were not often
Recruited and fill'd, and this obliged him to buy
more every Year.</P>
<P>IT happen'd while I was here, that a Ship ar∣rived
from <HI>London,</HI> with several Servants, and
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
among the rest was seventeen Transported Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lons,
some burnt in the Hand, others not; eight
of whom my Master bought for the time specified
in the Warrant for their Transportation, re∣spectively,
some for a longer, some a shorter
term of Years.</P>
<P>OUR Master was a great Man in the Country,
and a Justice of Peace, tho' he seldom came down
to the Plantation where I was, yet as the new
Servants were brought on Shore, and delivered
at our Plantation, his Worship came thither, in
a kind of State to see and Receive them: When
they were brought before him, I was call'd among
other Servants, as a kind of a Guard to take them
into Custody, after he had seen them, and to car∣ry
them to the Work; they were brought by a
Guard of Seamen from the Ship, and the second
Mate of the Ship came with them, and deliver'd
them to our Master, with the Warrant for their
Transportation, as above.</P>
<P>WHEN his Worship had read over the Warrants,
he call'd them over by their Names, One by One,
and having let them know by his reading the
Warrants over again to each Man respectively,
that he knew for what Offences they were
Transported; he talk'd to every one seperately
very gravely, let them know how much Favour
they had receiv'd in being sav'd from the Gallows,
which the Law had appointed for their Crimes,
that they were not Sentenced to be Transported,
but to be hang'd, and that Transportation was
granted them upon their own Request and humble
Petition.</P>
<P>THEN he laid before them, that they ought to
look upon the Life they were just a going to en∣ter
upon, as just beginning the World again; that
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
if they thought fit to be diligent, and sober, they
would after the time they were order'd to Serve
was expir'd, be encourag'd by the Constitution of
the Country, to Settle and Plant for themselves,
and that even he himself would be so kind to
them, that if he liv'd to see any of them serve
their Time faithfully out, it was his custom to
assist his Servants, in order to their Settling in
that Country, according as their Behaviour might
Merit from him, and they would see and know
several Planters round about them, who now were
in very good Circumstances, and who formerly
were only his Servants, in the same Condition
with them, and came from the same Place; that
is to say, <HI>Newgate,</HI> and some of them had the
Mark of it in their Hands, but were now very
honest Men, and liv'd in very good Repute.</P>
<P>AMONG the rest of his new Servants, he came
to a young Fellow not above 17 or 18 Years of
Age, and his Warrant mention'd that he was, tho'
a young Man, yet an old Offender; that he had
been several times Condemn'd, but had been Re∣spited
or Pardon'd, but still he continued an in∣corrigible
Pick-pocket; that the Crime for which
he was now Transported was for Picking a Mer∣chant's
Pocket-Book, or Letter Case out of his
Pocket, in which was Bills of <HI>Exchange,</HI> for a
very great Sum of Money; that he had afterward
receiv'd the Money upon some of the Bills; but
that going to a Goldsmith in <HI>Lombard street</HI> with
another Bill, and having demanded the Money,
he was stopp'd, Notice having been given of the
Loss of them; that he was condemn'd to Die for
the Felony, and being so well known for an old
Offender, had certainly died, but the Mer∣chant
upon his earnest Application, had obtain'd
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
that he should be Transported, on Condition that
he restor'd all the rest of the Bills, which he had
done accordingly.</P>
<P>OUR Master talk'd along time to this young
Fellow; mention'd with some surprize, that he so
young should have follow'd such a wicked Trade
so long, as to obtain the Name of an old Offen∣der,
at so young an Age, and that he should be
stil'd incorrigible, which is to signify, that not∣withstanding
his being Whipt two or three times,
and several times punish'd by Imprisonment, and
once burnt in the Hand, yet nothing would do
him any good; but that he was still the same.
He talk'd mighty Religiously to this Boy, and
told him, God had not only spar'd him from the
Gallows, but had now mercifully deliver'd him
from the Opportunity of committing the same
Sin again, and put it into his Power to live an
honest Life, which perhaps he knew not how to
do before; and tho' some part of this Life now
might be laborious, yet he ought to look on it to
be no more, then being put out Apprentice to an
honest Trade, in which, when he came out of his
Time he might be able to Set up for himself, and
live honestly.</P>
<P>THEN he told him, that while he was a Servant,
he would have no Opportunity to be dishonest,
so when he came to be for himself, he would
have no Temptation to it, and so after a great
many other kind things said to him, and the rest
they were dismist.</P>
<P>I WAS exceedingly mov'd at this Discourse of
our Masters, as any Body would judge I must be,
when it was directed to such a young Rogue, born
a Thief, and bread up a Pick pocket like my self,
for I thought all my Master said was spoken to
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
me, and sometimes it came into my Head, that
sure my Master was some extraordinary Man,
and that he knew all things that ever I had done
in my Life.</P>
<P>BUT I was surpriz'd to the last degree, when
my Master dismissing all the rest of us Servants,
Pointed at me, and speaking to his head Clerk, <HI>here
says he,</HI> bring that young Fellow hither to me.</P>
<P>I HAD been near a Year in the Work, and I
had ply'd it so well, that the Clerk, or head
Man, either flatter'd me, or did really believe
that I behav'd very well; but I was terribly
frighted to hear myself call'd out, aloud, just as
they us'd to call for such as had done some Mis∣demeanour,
and were to be Lash'd, or otherwise
Corrected.</P>
<P>I CAME in like a Malefactor indeed, and
thought I look'd like one just taken in the Fact,
and carry'd before the Justice; and indeed when
I came in, for I was carry'd into an Inner-Room,
or Parlour in the House to him; his Discourse to
the rest was in a large Hall, where he sat in a
Seat like a Lord Judge upon the Bench, or a Pet∣ty
King upon his Throne.</P>
<P>WHEN I came in, <HI>I say,</HI> he ordered his Man
to withdraw, and I standing half naked, and bare∣headed
with my Haugh or Hoe in my Hand, (the
Posture and Figure I was in at my Work,) near the
Door, he bad me lay down my Hoe, and come
nearer; then he began to look a little less Stern and
Terrible, than I fancy'd him to look before; or per∣haps
both his Countenance then, and before might
be to my Imagination, differing from what they
really were; for we do not always Judge those
things by the real Temper of the Person, but by
the Measure of our Apprensions.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="162"/>
Hark ye young Man, How old are you? <HI>says
my Master,</HI> and so our Dialogue began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Sir, I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What is your Name?</P>

<P>They call me COLONEL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was not call'd Col. <HI>Jack as at London,</HI> but <HI>Colonel.</HI> and they did not know me by any other Name.</NOTE> here, but

<P>What is thy Christian Name then <HI>Colonel,</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Sir, to tell <HI>your Honour</HI> the Truth,
I know little, or nothing of myself,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>NOTE,</HI> He did not now talk quite so blindly, and Childishly, as when he was a Boy, and when the Custom-House Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to him about his Names.</NOTE> nor what
my true Name is; but thus I have been call'd
ever since I remember; which is my Christian-Name,
or which my Sir-Name, or whether I was
ever Christen'd, or not, I cannot tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, however, that's honestly answer'd,
Pray how came you hither, and on what Account
are you made a Servant here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish your Honour could have Patience
with me, to hear the whole Story; it is the hard∣est,
and most unjust thing that ever came be∣fore
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, tell it me at large then, I'll
hear it, I Promise that, if it be an Hour long.</P>
<P>THIS encourag'd me, and I began at my being
a Soldier, and being persawded to Desert at
<HI>Dumbar,</HI> and gave him all the Particulars,
as they are related above, to the time of my
coming on Shore, and the Captain talking to
me about my Bill after I arriv'd here: He held
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
up his Hands several times as I went on, ex∣pressing
his abhorrence of the Usage I had met
with at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and enquir'd the Name of
the Master of the Ship, for <HI>said he,</HI> that Cap∣tain
for all his smooth Words must be a Rogue;
so I told him his Name, and the Name of the
Ship, and he took it down in his Book, and
then we went on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray answer me honestly too, to
another Question, What was it made you so
much concern'd at my talking to the Boy there,
the Pick-pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your Honour, it mov'd me,
to hear you talk so kindly to a poor Slave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was that all, speak truly now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, but a secret Wish came in∣to
my Thoughts, that you that were so good to
such a Creature as that, could but one way or o∣ther
know my Case, and that if you did, you
would certainly pity me, and do something for
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but was there nothing in his Case
that hit with your own, that made you so affect∣ed
with it, for I saw Tears come from your Eyes,
and it was that made me call, to speak to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Sir, I have been a wicked idle
Boy, and was left Desolate in the World; but
that Boy is a Thief, and condemn'd to be hang'd,
I never was before a Court of Justice, in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I won't Examine you too far, if you
were never before a Court of Justice, and are not
a Criminal Transported, I have nothing farther
to enquire of you: You, have been ill used, that's
certain and was it that, that affected you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, please your * Honour [* we
all call'd him his Honour, or his Worship.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I do know your Case, What
can I do for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak of a Bill of 94 <HI>l.</HI> of which you
would have given the Captain, 40 <HI>l.</HI> for your Li∣berty,
Have you that Bill in your keeping still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, * here it is, [I pull'd it out of
the Wastband of my Drawers, where I always
found means to preserve it, wrap'd up in a peice
of Paper, and pin'd to the Wastband, and yet
almost worn out too, with often pining, and remo∣ving,
so I gave it to him to read, and he read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this Gentleman in being that
gave you the Bill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, he was alive, and in good Health,
when I came from <HI>London,</HI> which you may see by
the Date of the Bill, for I came away the next
Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not wonder that the Captain of the
Ship, was willing to get this Bill of you when
you came on Shore here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have given it into his possessi∣on,
if he would have carryed me, and my Bro∣ther
back again to <HI>England,</HI> and have taken what
he ask'd for us out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but he knew better than that too,
he knew if you had any Friends there, they
would call him to an Account for what he had
done; but I wonder he did not take it from you
while you were at Sea, either by Fraud or by
Force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not attempt that indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, young Man, I have a mind to
try if I can do you any, Service in this Case; on
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
my Word, if the Money can be paid, and you
can get it safe over, I might put you in a
way how to be a better Man than your Master,
if you will be honest and diligent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I behave myself in your Service Sir,
you will I hope judge of the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps you Hanker after returning
to <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed Sir, if I can but get my
Bread honestly here, I have no mind to go to
<HI>England,</HI> for I know not how to get my Bread
there, if I had I had not Listed for a Soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I must ask you some Questions
about that Part hereafter, for 'tis indeed some∣thing
strange, that you should List for a Soldier,
when you had 94l. in your Pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall give your Worship as particu∣lar
Account of that, as I have of the other Part
of my Life, if you please, but 'tis very long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we will have that another time;
but to the Case in Hand, Are you willing I should
send to any Body at <HI>London,</HI> to talk with that
Gentleman that gave you the Bill; not to take
the Money of him, but to ask him only whether
he has so much Money; of yours in his Hands?
and whether he will Part with it, when you shall
give Order, and send the Bill, or a * Duplicate
of it * (<HI>that is, says he,</HI> the Copy) and it was
well he did say so, <HI>for I did not understand the
Word</HI> [Duplicate at all.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, I will give you the Bill it self
if you please, I can trust it with you, tho' I cou'd
not with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, young Man, I won't take it
from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish your Worship would please to
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
keep it for me, for if I should lose it, then I am
quite undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will keep it for you <HI>Jack</HI> if you will, but
then you shall have a Note under my Hand, signi∣fying
that I have it, and will return it you upon
Demand, which will be safe to you as the Bill, I
won't take it else.</P>
<P>So I gave my Master the Bill, and he gave me
his Note for it, and he was a faithful Steward for
me, as you will hear in its Place: After this Con∣ference,
I was dissmissed, and went to my Work,
but about two Hours after, the Steward or the O∣verseer
of the Plantation came riding by, and
coming up to me as I was at Work, pull'd a Bot∣tle
out of his Pocket, and calling me to him, gave
me a Dram of Rum, when in good Manners, I
had taken but a little Sup, he held it out to me
again, and bad me take another, and spoke won∣derous
civilly to me, quite otherwise than he
us'd to do.</P>
<P>THIS encouraged me, and hearten'd me very
much, but yet I had no particular View of any
thing, or which way I should have any Relief.</P>
<P>A DAY or two after, when we were all going
out to our Work in the Morning, the Overseer
call'd me to him again, and gave me a Dram, and
a good peice of Bread, and bad me come off from
my Work about One a-Clock, and come to him
to the House, for he must speak with me.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to him, I came to be sure in
the ordinary Habit of a poor half naked Slave;
Come hither young Man, <HI>says he,</HI> and give me
your Hoe, when I gave it him; well, <HI>says he,</HI>
you are to Work no more, in this Plantation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167"/>
I look'd surpriz'd, and as if I was Frighted,
What have I done, Sir? <HI>said I,</HI> and whether am
I to be sent away.</P>
<P>NAY, nay, <HI>says he,</HI> and look'd very pleasant∣ly
do not be frighted, 'tis for your good, 'tis not
to hurt you, I am order'd to make an Overseer of
you, and you shall be a Slave no longer.</P>
<P>ALAS! <HI>says I,</HI> to him, I, an Overseer! I am in
no Condition for it, I have no Cloaths to put on,
no Linnen, nothing to help myself.</P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>says he,</HI> you may be better us'd
than you are aware of, come hither with me; so
he led me into a vast great Ware-house, or rather
Set of Ware-houses, one within another, and cal∣ling
the Ware-house-Keeper, <HI>here says he,</HI> you must
Cloth this Man, and give him every thing neces∣sary,
upon the Foot of Number Five, and give
the Bill to me, our Master has order'd me to al∣low
it, in the Account of the West Plantation:
That was it seems the Plantation where I was
to go.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the Ware-house Keeper car∣ryed
me into an Inner-Ware-house, where were
several Suites of Cloths of the Sort his Orders
mention'd; which were plain but good sorts of
Cloths ready made, being of a good Broad Cloth,
about 115. a Yard in <HI>England,</HI> and with this he
gave me three good Shirts, two Pair of Shoes,
Stockings and Gloves, a Hat, six Neckcloths,
and in short, every thing I could want; and when
he had look'd every thing out, and fitted them,
he lets me into a little Room by it self; here
<HI>says he,</HI> go in there a Slave, and come out a Gen∣tleman;
and with that carryed every thing into
the Room, and shutting the Door, bid me put them
on, which I did most willingly; and now you
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
may believe, that I began to hope for some∣thing
better than ordinary.</P>
<P>IN a little while after this, came the Over∣seer,
and gave me Joy of my new Cloths, and
told me I must go with him; so I was carried to
another Plantation larger than that where I
work'd before, and where there were two Over∣seers,
or Clerks, One within Doors, and Two with∣out:
This last was remov'd to another Plantati∣on,
and I was plac'd there in his room, <HI>that is
to say,</HI> as the Clerk without Doors, and my Busi∣ness
was to look after the Servants <HI>Negroes,</HI> and
take Care that they did their Business, provide
their Food, and in short, both Govern and Di∣rect
them.</P>
<P>I WAS elevated to the highest degree in my
Thoughts at this Advancement, and it is impossi∣ble
for me to express the Joy of my Mind upon
this Occasion; but there came a difficulty up∣on
me, that shock'd me so violently, and went
so against my very Nature, that I really had al∣most
forfeited my Place about it; and in all
Appearance the Favour of our Master, who had
been so generous to me; and this was, that when
I entered upon my Office, I had a Horse given
me, and a long Horse-whip, like what we call in
<HI>England</HI> a Hunting-whip; the Horse was to ride
up and down all over the Plantation to see the
Servants and <HI>Negroes</HI> did their Work, and the
Plantation being so large, it could not be done on
Foot, at least so often, and so effectually as was re∣quir'd;
and the Horse-whip was given me to correct
and lash the Slaves and Servants, when they pro∣ved
Negligent, or Quarrelsome, or in short were
guilty of any Offence: This part turn'd the ve∣ry
blood within my Veins, and I could not think
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
of it with any temper; that I, who was but Ye∣sterday
a Servant or Slave like them, and under
the Authority of the same Lash, should lift up
my Hand to the Cruel Work, which was my Ter∣ror
but the Day before: This I say, I cou'd not
do; insomuch, that the <HI>Negroes</HI> perceiv'd it, and
I had soon so much Contempt upon my Authori∣ty,
that we were all in Disorder.</P>
<P>THE Ingratitude of their Return, for the Com∣passion
I shew'd them, provok'd me, I Confess,
and a little harden'd my Heart, and I began with
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> two of whom I was oblig'd to Cor∣rect;
and I thought I did it most Cruelly; but after
I had Lash'd them till every Blow I struck them,
hurt my self, and I was ready to Faint at the
Work, the Rogues Laught at me, and one of them
had the Impudence to say behind my Back, that
if he had the Whipping of me, he would show me
better how to Whip a <HI>Negro.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, however, I had no Power to do it in
such a Barbarous manner, as I found it was neces∣sary
to have it done; and the Defect began to be
a Detriment to our Masters B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siness, and now I
began indeed to see, that the Cruelty, so much
talk'd of, used in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and o∣ther
Colonies, in Whipping the <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves, was
not so much owing to the Tyranny, and Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,
and Cruelty of the <HI>English,</HI> as had been reported;
the <HI>English</HI> not being accounted to be of a Cruel
Disposition, and really are not so: But that it is
owing to the Brutallity, and obstinate Temper
of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> who cannot be mannag'd by Kind∣ness,
and Courtisy; but must be rul'd with a Rod
of Iron, beaten with <HI>Scorpions,</HI> as the Scripture
calls it; and must be used as they do use them, or
they would Rise and Murther all their Masters,
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
which their Numbers consider'd, would not be hard
for them to do, if they had Arms and Ammuni∣tion
suitable to the Rage and Cruelty of their
Nature.</P>
<P>BUT I began to see at the same time, that this
Brutal temper of the <HI>Negroes</HI> was not rightly ma∣nag'd;
that they did not take the best Course
with them, to make them sensible, either of Mer∣oy,
or Punishment; and it was Evident to me,
that even the worst of those tempers might be
brought to a Compliance, without the Lash, or
at least without so much of it, as they generally
Inflicted</P>
<P>OUR Master was really a Man of Humanity
himself, and was sometimes so full of Tenderness,
that he would forbid the Severities of his Over∣seers
and Stewards; but he saw the Necessity of
it, and was oblig'd at last to leave it to the Dis∣cretion
of his upper Servants: yet he would often
bid them be Merciful, and bid them consider the
Difference of the Constitution of the Bodies of
the <HI>Negro</HI>'s; some being less able to bear the Tor∣tures
of their Punishment than others, and some
of them less Obstinate too, than others.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, some body was so officious as to
inform him against me upon this Occasion, and let
him know, that I Neglected his Affairs, and that
the Servants were under no Government; by
which means his Plantation was not duly ma∣nag'd,
and that all things were in Disorder.</P>
<P>THIS was a heavy Charge for a young Over∣seer,
and his Honour came like a Judge, with all
his Attendants, to look into things, and hear the
Cause: However, he was so just to me, as that
before he Censur'd me, he resolv'd to hear me
fully; and that not only Publickly, but in Pri∣vate
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
too; and the last part of this was my parti∣cular
good Fortune, for as he had formerly allow'd
me to speak to him with Freedom; so I had the
like Freedom now, and had full Liberty to Ex∣plain,
and Defend my self.</P>
<P>I knew nothing of the Complaint against me,
till I had it from his own Mouth; nor any thing
of his coming, till I saw him in the very Planta∣tion,
viewing his Work, and viewing the several
Peices of Ground that were order'd to be New
Planted; and after he had Rod all round, and
seen things in the Condition, which they were to
be seen in; how every thing was in its due Order,
and the Servants and <HI>Negroes</HI> were all at Work,
and every thing appearing to his Mind, he went
into the House.</P>
<P>As I saw him come up the Walks, I ran to∣wards
him, made my Homage, and gave him my
humble Thanks for the Goodness he had shew'd
me, in taking me from the Miserable Condition
I was in before, and Employing and Entrust∣ing
me in his Business; and he look'd pleasant
enough, tho' he did not say much at first, and I
attended him thro' the whole Plantation, gave
him an Account of every thing as he went along,
answer'd all his Objections, and Enquiries, every
where in such a manner, as it seems, he did not
expect: And, as he acknowledg'd afterward, every
thing was very much to his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE was an Overseer, as I observ'd; belong∣ing
to the same Plantation, who was, tho' not
over me, yet in a Work Superior to mine; for
his Business was to see the <HI>Tobacco</HI> pack'd up, and
deliver it either on Board the Sloops, or otherwise,
as our Master order'd, and to receive <HI>English</HI>
Goods from the Grand Ware-house, which was at
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
the other Plantation, because, that was nearest
the Water-side; and in short, to keep the Ac∣counts:
This Overseer, an Honest and upright
Man, made no Complaint to him of his Busi∣ness
being Neglected, as above, or of any thing
like it, tho' he Enquir'd of him about it, and that
very strictly too.</P>
<P>I should have said, that as he Rid over the Plan∣tation;
he came in his round to the Place where
the Servants were usually Corrected, when they
had done any Fault; and there stood two <HI>Negroes</HI>
with their Hands ty'd behind them, as it were
under Sentence; and when he came near them,
they fell on their Knees, and made pitiful Signs
to him for Mercy: Alas! Alas! <HI>says he,</HI> turning
to me, why did you bring me this way? I do not
love such Sights, what must I do now? I must
Pardon them; prethee, what have they done? I
told him the particular Offences, which they were
brought to the Place for; one had Stole a Bottle
of Rum, and had made himself Drunk with it,
and when he was Drunk, had done a great many
Mad things, and had attempted to knock one of
the white Servants Brains out with a Hand-spike;
but that the white Man had avoided the Blow,
and striking up the <HI>Negroes</HI> Heels, had seiz'd him,
and brought him Prisoner thither, where he had
lain all Night; and that I had told him he was to
be Whipp'd that Day, and the next three Days,
twice every Day.</P>
<P>AND could you be so Cruel, <HI>says his Honour,</HI>
why, you would Kill the poor Wretch! and so
beside the Blood which you would have to answer
for, you would lose me a lusty Man <HI>Negro,</HI> which
Cost me at least 30 or 40<HI>l.</HI> and bring a Reproach
upon my whole Plantation; nay, and more than
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
that, some of them in Revenge would Murther me,
if ever it was in their Power.</P>
<P>SIR, <HI>says I,</HI> if those Fellows are not kept under
by Violence, I believe you are Satisfied, nothing
is to be done with them; and it is reported in
your Works, that I have been rather their Jest,
than their Terror, for want of using them as they
deserve; and I was resolv'd how muchsoever it is
against my own Disposition, that you Service
should not suffer for my unseasonable Forbear∣ance;
and therefore, if I had Scourg'd him to
Death:—Hold, <HI>says he,</HI> no, no, by no means,
any such Severity in my Bounds; remember
young Man, you were once a Servant, deal as
you would acknowledge'd it would be just to deal
with you in his Case, and mingle always some
Mercy; I desire it, and let the Consequence of
being too gentle, be plac'd to my Account.</P>
<P>THIS was as much as I cou'd desire, and the
more, because what pass'd, was in Publick, and
several, both <HI>Negroes</HI> and white Servants, as
well as the particular Persons, who had accused
me, heard it all, tho' I did not know it: A Cruel
Dog of an Overseer, <HI>says one of the white Ser∣vants
behind,</HI> he would have Whipp'd poor <HI>Bul∣let-head,</HI>
(<HI>so they call'd the</HI> Negro, that was to be
Punish'd) to Death, if <HI>his Honour</HI> had not hap∣pen'd
to come to Day.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I urg'd the Notorious Crime this
Fellow was Guilty off, and the Danger there was
in such Forbearance, from the Refactory and in∣corrigible
Temper of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> and press'd a
little the Necessity of making Examples; but <HI>he
said,</HI> well, well, do it the next time, but not
so, I said no more.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174"/>
THE other Fellows Crime was trifling, com∣par'd
with this; and the Master went forward,
talking of it to me, and I following him, till we
came to the House; when after he had been sat
down a while, he call'd me to him: And not
suffering my Accusers to come near, till he had
heard my Defence, he began with me thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Must.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark ye, young Man, I must have some
Discourse with you: Your Conduct is Complain'd
of, since I set you over this Plantation; I thought
your Sence of the Obligation I had laid on you,
would have secur'd your Diligence, and Faith∣fulness
to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry any Complaint should
be made of me, because the Obligation I am un∣der
to <HI>your Honour,</HI> (and which I freely Confess)
does bind me to your Interest in the strongest
manner Imaginable; and however, I may have
mistaken my Business, I am sure I have not wil∣lingly
Neglected it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall not Condemn you, without
hearing you, and therefore I call'd you in now,
to tell you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly Thank <HI>your Honour,</HI> I have but
one Petition more, <HI>and that is,</HI> that I may know
my Accusation, and if you please, my Accusers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first, you shall, <HI>and that is,</HI> the
Reason of my talking to you in Private; and if
there is any need of a farther Hearing, you shall
know your Accusers too: What you are charg'd
with, is just contrary to what appear'd to me just
now, and therefore you and I must come to a new
understanding about it; for I thought I was too
cunning for you, and now I think you have been
too Cunning for me.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="175"/>
<HI>Jack.</HI> I hope <HI>your Honour</HI> will not be offended,
that I do not fully understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you do not; come tell me Ho∣nestly,
did you really intend to Whip the poor
<HI>Negro</HI> twice a Day, for four Days together; <HI>that
is to say,</HI> to Whip him to Death, for that would
have been the <HI>English</HI> of it, and the End of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may be permitted to Guess, Sir, I
believe I know the Charge that is brought against
me; and that <HI>your Honour</HI> has been told, that I
have been too gentle with the <HI>Negroes,</HI> as well as
with other Servants; and that when, they have
deserv'd to be us'd with the accustom'd Severity
of the Country, I have not given them half
enough; and that by this Means they are careless
of your Business, and that your Plantation is not
well look'd after, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Must.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you Guess right, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first Part of the Charge I Confess,
but the last I Deny; and appeal to <HI>your Honour's</HI>
strictest Examination, into every part of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the last Part could be true, I would be
glad the first were; for it would be an infinite
Satisfaction to me, that my Business not being
Neglected, nor our safety Endanger'd, those poor
Wretches cou'd be us'd with more Humanity, for
Cruelty is the Aversion of my Nature; and it is
the only uncomfortable thing that attends me, in
all my Prosperity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I freely acknowledge, Sir, that at first,
it was impossible for me to bring my self to that
Terrible Work: How could I, that was but just
come out of the Terror of it my self, and had but
the Day before been a poor Naked miserable Ser∣vant
my self, and might be to Morrow reduc'd
to the same Condition again; How cou'd I use
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here he shew'd him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Horse-whip that was given him, with h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s New Office.</NOTE>this Terrible Weapon on the naked Flesh of my
Fellow Servants, as well as Fellow Creatures? As
least, Sir, when my Duty made it absolutely Ne∣cessary,
I cou'd not do it without the utmost
Horror: I beseech you Pardon me, if I have such
a Tenderness in my Nature, that tho' I might be
fit to be your Servant; I am incapable of being
an Executioner, having been an Offender my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but how then can my Business be
done? And how will this terrible Obstinacy of
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> who they tell me, can be no other∣wise
governed, be kept from Neglect of their
Work, or even Insolence and Rebellion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>This brings me, Sir, to the latter part of
my Defence; and here, I hope <HI>your Honour</HI> will
be pleased to call my Accusers, or that you will
give your self the Trouble of taking the exactest
View of your Plantation, and see, or let them
shew you, if any thing is Neglected, if your Bu∣siness
has suffer'd in any thing, or if your <HI>Negroes</HI>
or other Servants are under less Government than
they were before; and if on the contrary, I have
found out that happy Secret, to have good Order
kept, the Business of the Plantation done, and
that with Diligence, and Dispatch, and that
the <HI>Negroes</HI> are kept in Awe, the natural Temper
of them Subjected, and the Safety and Peace of
your Family secur'd; as well by gentle Means,
as by Rough, by moderate Correction, as by Tor∣ture,
and Barbarity; by a due Awe of just Disci∣pline,
as by the Horror of unsufferable Torments,
I hope <HI>your Honour</HI> will not lay that Sin to my
Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="177"/>
<HI>Mast.</HI> No indeed, you would be the most ac∣ceptable
Mannager that ever I employed; But
how then does this consist with the cruel Sentence
you had pass'd on the poor Fellow, that is in your
Condemn'd Hole yonder, who was to be Whipp'd
eight times in four Days?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; first Sir, he remains un∣der
the terrible Apprensions of a Punishment,
so Severe, as no <HI>Negro</HI> ever had before; this Fel∣low,
with your leave, I intended to Release to
Morrow, without any Whipping at all, after Talk∣ing
to him in my way about his Offence, and
raising in his Mind a Sense of the value of Par∣don;
and if this makes him a better Servant than
the severest Whipping will do, than I p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esume
you would allow, I have gain'd a Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>AY, but what if it should not be so,
for these Fellows have no Sense of Gratitude?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Sir, because they are never
Pardon'd, if they Offend they never know what
Mercy is, And what then have they to be Grate∣ful
for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art in the right indeed, where
there is no Mercy shew'd, there is no Obligation
laid upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Sir, if they have at any time been
let go, which is very seldom, they are not told
what the Case is; they take no pains with them
to imprint Principles of Gratitude on their
Minds, to tell them what Kindness is shewn
them, and what they are Indebeted for it, and
what they might Gain in the End by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think such usage would do?
would it make any impression? you perswade
your self it would; but you see 'tis against the
receiv'd Notion of the whole Country.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="178"/>
<HI>Jack.</HI> There are it may be Publick and Natio∣nal
Mistakes and Errors in Conduct, and this
is One.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you try'd it? you cannot say
it is a Mistake, till you have try'd and prov'd it
to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your whole Plantation is a Proof of it.
This very Fellow had never acted as he did, if he
had not gotten Rum in his Head, and been out of
the Government of himself; so that indeed all the
Offence I ought to have punish'd him for, had been
that of stealing a Bottle of Rum, and drinking it
all up; in which Case, like <HI>Noa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> he did not
know the str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngth of it, and when he had it in
his Head he was a mad Man, he was as one
Raging and Distracted; so that for all the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
he deserv'd Pity, rather than Punishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou are right, certainly right, and
thou wilt be a rare Fellow if thou canst bring
these Notions into Practise; I wish you had try'd
it upon any one particular <HI>Negroe,</HI> that I might
see an Example, I would give 500 <HI>l.</HI> it could be
brought to bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire nothing, Sir, but your Fa∣vour,
and the Advantage of obliging you, I will
show you an Example of it, among your own
<HI>Negro's,</HI> and all the Plantation will acknow∣ledge
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make my very Heart glad within
me, <HI>Jack;</HI> if you can bring this to pass, I here
give you my Word, Ill' not only give you your
own Freedom, but make a Man of you for this
World, as long as you live.</P>
<P>UPON this, I Bow'd to him very respectfully,
and told him the following Story. There is a <HI>Ne∣groe,</HI>
Sir, in your Plantation, who has been your
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
Servant several Years before I came; he did a Fault
that was of no great Consequence in itself, but
perhaps would have been worse, if they had in∣deed
gone farther, and I had him brought into the
usual Place, and ty'd him by the Thumbs for Cor∣rection,
and he was told that he should be Whip∣p'd
and Pickl'd in a dreadful manner.</P>
<P>AFTER I had made proper Impressions on his
Mind, of the Terror of his Punishment, and
found that he was sufficiently humbled by it, I
went into the House, and caus'd him to be
brought out, just as they do when they go to Cor∣rect
the <HI>Negroes</HI> on such Occasions; when he
was strip'd and ty'd up, he had two Lashes gi∣ven
him, that were indeed very cruel Ones, and
I call'd to them to hold; <HI>hold said I,</HI> to the two
Men that had just began to lay on upon the poor
Fellow, <HI>hold said I,</HI> let me talk with him.</P>
<P>So he was taken down, then I began, and repre∣sented
to him how kind you, that were his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the <HI>Negroes</HI> call the Owner of the Plantation, or at least so they call'd him, because he was a great Man in the Country, having three or four large Planatations.</NOTE>
Great
Master had been to him; that you had never
done him any Harm, that you had us'd him
gently, and he had never been brought to this
Punishment in so many Year, tho' he had done
some Faults before; that this was a notorious Of∣fence,
for he had stolen some Rum, and made
himself, and two other <HI>Negroes</HI> Drunk<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To be Drunk in a <HI>Negroe,</HI> is to be be Mad, for when they ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rum they are worse than Raving, and fit to do any manner of Mis∣chief.</NOTE> mad,
and had abus'd two Women <HI>Negroes,</HI> who had
Husbands in our Master's Service, but in ano∣ther
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
Plantation; and play'd several other Pranks,
and for this I had appointed him this Punish∣ment.</P>
<P>HE shook his Head, and made Signs, that he
was <HI>muchee sorree,</HI> as he call'd it, And what will
you say, or do, <HI>said I,</HI> if I should prevail with the
Great Master to pardon you? I have a mind to
go and see if I can beg for you: He told me he
would lye down, let me kill him, me will, <HI>says he,</HI> run
go, fetch, bring for you as long as me live: this
was the opportunity I had a mind to have, to trye
whether as <HI>Negroes</HI> have all the other Faculties of
reasonable Creatures, they had not also some
Sense of Kindness, some Principles of natural
Generosity, which in short, is the Foundation of
G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atitude; for Gratitude is the Product of gene∣roud
Principles.</P>
<P>YOU please me with the beginning of this
Story, <HI>says he,</HI> I hope you have carryed it on.</P>
<P>YES, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> it has been carryed on far∣ther
perhaps, than you may imagine, or will
think has been possible in such a Case.</P>
<P>BUT I was not so Arrogant, as to assume the
Merit to Myself; no, no, <HI>said I,</HI> I do not ask
you to go, or run for me, you must do all that for
our Great Master, for it will be from him entirely
that you will be Pardon'd, if you are Pardon'd
at all; for your Offence is against him, and
what will you say, will you be Grateful to him,
and run, go, setch, bring, for him as long as you
live, as you have said you would for me.</P>
<P><HI>YES. indeed,</HI> says he, <HI>and muchee do, muchee do,
for, you too</HI> (he would not leave me out) <HI>you ask
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for me.</HI></P>
<P>WELL. I put off all his promis'd Gratitude
to me, from myself, as was my Duty, and plac'd
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
it to your Account, told him I knew you was
<HI>muchee Good, muchee Pitiful,</HI> and I would per∣swade
you if I could; and so told him I would
go to you, and he should be Whipp'd no more till
I came again; but hark ye, <HI>Mouchat,</HI> says I, that
was the Negro's <HI>Name,</HI> they tell me when I came
hither, that there is no showing kindness to any
of you <HI>Negro</HI>'s, that when we spare you from
Whipping you Laugh at us, and are the worse.</P>
<P>HE look'd very serious at me, and said, <HI>O,
that no so,</HI> the Masters say so, <HI>but no be so; no be
so,</HI> indeedè, indeedè, <HI>and so we Parlee'd.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do they say so then? to be sure
they have try'd you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they no try, they say so, but
no trye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear them all say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me tell you the True, they have no
Mercièè, they Beat us Cruel, all Cruel, they ne∣ver
have show Mercèè. How can they tell we be
no better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do they never spare?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master, me speakee de true, they never
give Mercièè, they always Whippee, Lashee,
Knowckee down, all Cruel: <HI>Negroe</HI> be muchee bet∣ter
Man do muchee better Work, but they tell
us no Mercee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do they never show any
Mercy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never, no never, all whipee, all
whipee, Cruel, worse than they whippee de Horse,
whipee de Dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would they be better if they did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>Negroe</HI> be muchee better if
they be Mercieè; when they whippee, whippee,
<HI>Negroe</HI> muchee cry, muchee hate, would kill
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
if they had de Gun; but when they makee do
Mercy, then <HI>Negroe</HI> tell de great Tankee, and
love to Worke, and do muchee Work; and
because be good Master to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say no; you would Laugh at them,
and Mock when they shew Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! they say when they shew Mer∣cièè;
they never shew Merciéè, me never see them
shew one Mercièè, since me live.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> if this be so, really they go
I dare say, contrary to your Inclination; for I see
you are but too full of Pity for the Miserable; I
saw it in my own Case, and upon a Presumption,
that you had rather have your Work done from
a Principle of Love, than Fear, without making
your Servants Bleed for every Triffle, if it were
possible; I say, upon this Presumption, I dealt with
this <HI>Mouchat,</HI> as you shall hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never met with any thing of this
Kind, since I have been a Planter; which is now
above 40 Year, I am delighted with the Story,
go on, I expect a pleasant Conclusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Conclusion, Sir, will be, I believe
as much to your Satisfaction, as the beginning;
for it every way answer'd my Expectation, and
will yours also; and shew you how you might be
faithfully serv'd if you pleas'd, for 'tis certain
you are not so serv'd now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, they serve me but just as
they do the Devil, for fear I should hurt them;
but 'tis contrary to an ingenious Spirit, to delight
in such Service; I abhor it, if I could but know
how to get any other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is easy, Sir, to shew you, that you
may be serv'd upon better Principles; and Conse∣quently
be better serv'd, and more to your Satis∣faction;
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
and I dare undertake to convince you
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on with the Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>After I had talk'd thus to him, I said,
well <HI>Mouchat,</HI> I shall see how you will be after∣ward;
if I can get our Great Master to be Merci∣ful
to you at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you shall see, you <HI>mucheé</HI> see,
<HI>mucheè</HI> see.</P>
<P>UPON this, I call'd for my Horse, and went
from him, and made as if I Rode away to you,
who they told me was in the next Plantation;
and having staid four or five Hours, I came back
and talk'd to him again; told him that I had
waited on you, and that you had heard of his Of∣fence,
was highly Provok'd, and had resolv'd to
Cause him to be severely Punish'd for an Example
to all the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the Plantation: But that I
had told you how Penitent he was, and how good
he would be if you would Pardon him; and had at
last had prevail'd on you: That you had told me
what all People said of the <HI>Negroes;</HI> how, that to
shew them Mercy, was to make them think you
were never in Earnest with them, and that you
did but Triffle and Play with them; However,
that I had told you what he had said of himself;
and that it was not true of the <HI>Negroes,</HI>
and that the white Men said it, but that they
could not know, because they did never shew any
Mercy, and therefore had never try'd: That I
had perswaded you to shew Mercy, to try whe∣ther
kindness would prevail as much as Cruelty;
and now, Mouchat, <HI>said I,</HI> you will be let go,
pray let our Great Master see that I have said true;
so I order'd him to be unty'd, gave him a Dram
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
of Rum out of my Pocket-bottle, and order'd
them to give him some Victuals.</P>
<P>WHEN the Fellow was let loose, he came to
me, and kneel'd down to me, and took hold of
my Legs and of my Feet, and laid his Head upon
the Ground; and Sob'd, and Cry'd, like a Child
that had been Corrected, but could not speak for
his Life; and thus he continu'd a long time: I
would have taken him up, but he would not Rise,
but I Cry'd as fast as he, for I could not bear to
see a poor Wretch lye on the Ground to me, that
was but a Servant the other Day like himself;
at last, but not till a quarter of an Hour, I made
him get up, and then he spoke. <HI>Me muchee know
good Great Master,</HI> muchee good <HI>you Master: No</HI>
Negro <HI>unthankful,</HI> me Dye <HI>for them, do me so
muchee kind.</HI></P>
<P>I dismiss'd him then, and bad him go to his
Wife, for he was Marry'd, and not Work that
Afternoon; but as he was going away, I call'd
him again, and talk'd thus to him.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Monchat, says I,</HI> you see the white Men
can shew Mercy: Now you must tell all the <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI>
what has been reported of them; that they
Regard nothing but the Whip; that if they are
us'd gently, they are the Worse, not the Better; and
that this is the Reason, why the white Man shew
them no Mercy; and convince them, that they
would be much better treated, and us'd kindlier
if they would shew themselves as grateful, for
kind usage, as humble after Torment, and see if
you can Work on them.</P>
<P>ME go, me go, <HI>says he,</HI> me muchèè talk to
them, they be muchèè glad as me be, and do great
Work, to be us'd kind by de Great Master.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185"/>
<HI>Mast.</HI> Well, but now what Testimony have
you of this Gratitude you speak of? have you
seen any alteration among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I come next to that Part Sir, about a
Month after this, I caus'd a Report to be spread a∣broad
in the Plantation, that I had offended
you the Great Master, and that I was turn'd
out of the Plantation, and was to be hang'd;
your Honour knows that sometime ago, you sent
me upon your particular Business into <HI>Potuxent</HI>
River, where I was absent 12 Days, then I took
the opportunity to have this Report spread about
among the <HI>Negroes</HI> to see how it would work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? to see how <HI>Mouchat</HI> would take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and it made a Discovery in∣deed;
the poor Fellow did not believe it present∣ly,
but finding I was still Absent, he went to the
Head Clerk, and standing at his Door, said no∣thing,
but look'd like a Fool of 10 Year old;
after some time, the upper Overseer came out,
and seeing him stand there, at first said nothing,
supposing he had been sent of some Errand; but
observing him to stand stock stand stock still, and that he
was in the same Posture and Place, during the
time that he had pass'd and repass'd two or three
times, he stops short the last time of his coming
by, What do you want, <HI>says he</HI> to him, that
you stand idle here so long?</P>
<P>ME speakéè, me tell something, <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>THEN the Overseer thought some Discovery
was at Hand, and began to listen to him, What
would you tell me, <HI>says he?</HI></P>
<P>ME tell Pray, <HI>says he,</HI> where be de other
Master?</P>
<P>HE meant, he would ask where he was; What o∣ther
Master do you mean, <HI>says the Clerk?</HI> what do
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
you want to speak with the Great Master? he
can't be spoke with by you; Pray what is your Bu∣siness,
cannot you tell it to me?</P>
<P>No, no; me no speakêè, the Great Master, the
other Master, <HI>says Mouchat.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT, the <HI>Colonel? says the Clerk.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, yes, the <HI>Colonel, says he.</HI></P>
<P>WHY don't you know that he is to be hang'd
to Morrow, <HI>says the Clerk,</HI> for making the great
Master angry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, he understood the Plor, and took the opportunity to tell him that, to see what he would say.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>YES, yes, <HI>says Mouchat,</HI> me know, me know,
but me won't speak, me tell something.</P>
<P>WELL. What would you say, <HI>says the Clerk.</HI></P>
<P>O! me no, let him makèè de Great Master
angry, with that he kneel'd down to the Clerk.</P>
<P>WHAT ails you? <HI>says the Clerk,</HI> I tell you he
must be hang'd.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says he,</HI> no hang de Master, me kneel
for him to Great Master</P>
<P>YOU<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He understood him, he meant he would beg your Honour for me, that I might not be hang'd for Offending you.</NOTE> Kneel for him! <HI>says the Clerk,</HI> What do
you think the great Master will mind you?
he has made the great Master angry, and must be
hang'd, I tell you, what signifies your begging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negroe.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! me pray, me pray the great Ma∣ster
for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what ails you, that you would
pray for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! he beggèè the great Master for me,
now me beggèè for him; the great Master muchee
good, muchee good; he pardon me when the other
Master beggee me; now he pardon him, when
me beggee for him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, your begging won't do; will
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
you be hang'd for him? if you will do that, some∣thing
may be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negr.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, yes, me be hang, for de poor Ma∣ster
that beggeé for me, <HI>Mouchat</HI> shall hang,
the great Master shall hangee mee, whippee mee,
any thing to save the poor Master that beggee
me, yes, yes, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you in earnest <HI>Mouchat?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, me Telleé de true, the
great Master shall know me tellee de true, for
he shall see the <HI>White-Man</HI> hanggee me <HI>Mouchat,</HI>
poor <HI>Negroe Mouchat</HI> will be hangee, be whippee,
any thing for the poor Master that beggee for me.</P>
<P>WITH this the poor Fellow cry'd most pitiful∣ly,
and there was no room to Question his being
in earnest; when on a sudden, I appear'd, for I
was fetch'd to see all this Transaction: I was not
in the House at first, but was just come home from
the Business you sent me of, and heard it all, and
indeed neither the Clerk, nor I could bear it any
longer; so he came out to me, go to him, <HI>says
he,</HI> you have made an Example that will never
be forgot, that a <HI>Negroe</HI> can be Grateful; go
to him, <HI>adds he,</HI> for I can talk to him no longer;
so I appear'd, and spoke to him presently, and
let him see that I was at Liberty; but to hear
how the poor Fellow behav'd, your Honour can∣not
but he pleas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prethee go on I am pleas'd with it all,
'tis all a new Scene of <HI>Negroe</HI> Life to me, and
very moving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a good while he stood as if he had
been Thunder-struck, and stupid; but looking
steadily at me, tho' not speaking a Word, at
last he Mutters to himself with a kind of a Laugh,
Ay, ay, <HI>says he, Mouchat</HI> see, <HI>Mouchat</HI> no see;
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
me wakee, me no wakee; no hangee, no hangee,
he live truly, very live; and then on a sudden he
runs to me, snatches me away as if I had been a
Boy of ten Years old, and takes me up upon his
back, and run away with me, till I was fain to
cry out to him to stop; then he sets me down,
and looks at me again, then falls a Dancing a∣bout
me, as if he had been bewitch'd, just as you
have seen them do about their Wives and Chil∣dren
when they are Merry.</P>
<P>WELL, then he began to talk with me, and
told me what they had said to him, how I was
to be hang'd; well, says I, <HI>Mouchat,</HI> and would
you have been satisfied to be hang'd to save me,
yes, yes, <HI>says he,</HI> be truly hangee, to beggee you.</P>
<P>BUT why do you love me so well <HI>Mouchat?
said I.</HI></P>
<P>DID you no beggee me, <HI>he says,</HI> at the great Ma∣ster?
you savee me, make great Master muchee good,
muchee kind, no whippee me, me no forget, me
be whip'd, be hang'd, that you no be hang'd, me
dye, that you no dye, me no let any bad be with
you, all while that me live.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, your Honour may judge, whether
kindness well manag'd would not oblige these
People as well as Cruelty; and whether there
are Principles of Gratitude in them, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what then can be the Reason, that
we never believed it to be so before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, I fear that <HI>Mouchat</HI> gave the
true Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that Pray? that we were too
Cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they never had any Mercy shew'd
them; that we never try'd them, whether they
would be grateful or no; that if they did a Fault,
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
they were never spar'd, but punish'd with the
utmost Cruelty; so that they had no Passion, no
Affection to Act upon, but that of Fear, which
necessarily brought Hatred with it; but that if
they were used with Compassion, they would
Serve with Affection, as well as other Servants:
Nature is the same, and Reason Governs in just
Proportions in all Creatures; But having never
been let Taste what Mercy is, they know not how
to act from a Principle of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd, it is so; But now,
pray tell me, how did you put this in Practice
with the poor <HI>Negro's</HI> now in Bonds younder, when
you pass'd such a cruel Sentence upon them, that
they should be whipp'd twice a Day, for four
Days together, was that shewing Mercy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Method was just the same, and if
you please to inquire of Mr.—, your other Ser∣vant,
you will be satisfy'd that it was so; for we
agreed upon the same Measures as I took with
<HI>Monchat;</HI> Namely, first to put them into the
utmost Horror and Apprehensions of the Cru∣elest
Punishment that they had ever heard of,
and thereby enhaunce the Value of their Pardon,
which was to come as from your self, but not
without our great Intercession: Then I was to
argue with them, and Work upon their Reason,
to make the Mercy that was shew'd them sink
deep into their Minds, and give lasting Impres∣sions;
explain the Meaning of Gratitude to them,
and the Nature of an Obligation, and the like, as
I had done with <HI>Mouchat.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am answer'd, your Method is certain∣ly
Right, and I desire you may go on with it.
for I desire nothing (on this side Heaven) m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
than to have all my <HI>Negroes</HI> serve me from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ciples of Gratitude, for my Kindness to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
abhor to be fear'd like a Lion, like a Tyrant, it
is a Violence upon Nature every way, and is the
most disagreable Thing in the World to a gene∣rous
Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, I am doubtful that you may
not believe that I intended to act thus with
those poor Fellows; I beseech you to send for
Mr.—, that he may tell you, what we had
agreed on before I speak with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Reason have I to doubt that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you have not, but I should be
very Sorry you should think me capable of Exe∣cuting
such a Sentence as you have heard me own,
I had p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss'd on them; and there can be no way
effectualy to clear it up, but this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, seeing you put so much Weight
upon it, he shall be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was called, and being order'd by the Master, to tell the Mea∣sures that were conceited between them, for the Punishment, or Ma∣nag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ment of those <HI>Negroes;</HI> he gave it just as <HI>Jack</HI> had done before.</NOTE> call'd for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you are now, not only sa∣tisfy'd
of the Truth of the Account I gave, re∣lating
to the Method we had agreed on; but of its
being so proper, and so likely to answer your End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully satisfy'd, and shall be glad
to see that it answers the End; for, as I have said,
nothing can be more agreeable to me, nothing
has so much robb'd me of the Comfort of all my
Fortunes, as the Cruelty used in my Name, on
the Bodies of those poor Slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly wrong, Sir; it is not only
wrong, as it is barbarous and cruel; but it is
wrong too, as it is the worst way of Managing,
and of having your Business done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my Aversion, it fills my very
Soul, with Horror; I believe, if I should come
by, while they were using those Cruelties on the
poor Creatures, I should either sink down at the
Sight of it, or fly into a Rage, and kill the Fel∣low
that did it; tho' it is done too, by my own
Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, I dare say, I shall convince you
also that it is wrong, in Respect of Interest; and
that your Business shall be better discharg'd,
and your Plantations better order'd, and more
Work done by the <HI>Negroes,</HI> who shall be engaged
by Mercy and Lenity, than by those, who are
driven, and dragg'd by the Whips, and the Chains
of a merciless Tormentor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Nature of the Thing speaks
it self, doubtless it should be so, and I have
often thought it would be so, and a thousand
Times wish'd it might be so; but all my <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
People pretend otherwise, and that it is im∣possible
to bring the <HI>Negroes</HI> to any Sence of
Kindness, and Consequently not to any Obedience
of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true, Sir, that there may be
found here and there a <HI>Negro</HI> of a senceless, stu∣pid,
sordid Disposition; perfectly Untractable,
undocible, and incapable of due Impressions;
especially incapable of the Generosity of Principle
which I am speaking of; you know very well, Sir,
there are such among Christians, as well as among
<HI>Negroes,</HI> whence else came the <HI>English</HI> Proverb;
<HI>that if you save a Thief from the Gallows, he shall
be the first to Cut your Throat.</HI> But, Sir, if such a
Refractory, undocible Fellow comes in our way,
he must be dealt with, first, by the sinooth ways,
to Try him; then by the Violent way to Break
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
his Temper, as they Break a Horse; and if no∣thing
will do, such a Wretch should be Sold off,
and others Bought in his Room; for the Peace of
the Plantation should not be broken for one De∣vilish
temper'd Fellow; and if this was done, I
doubt not, you should have all your Plantation
carried on, and your Work done, and not a <HI>Ne∣gro</HI>
or a Servant upon it, but what would not on∣ly
Work for you, but even Die for you, if there
was an Occasion for it, as you see this poor
<HI>Mouchat</HI> would have done for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on with your Measures, and
may you succeed, I'll promise you I will fully
make you amends for it; I long to have these
Cruelties out of use, in my Plantation especially,
as for others, let them do as they will.</P>
</SP>
<P>OUR Master being gone, I went to the Prison∣ers,
and first, I suffer'd them to be told that the
Great Master had been there, and that he had
been enclin'd to Pardon them, till he knew
what their Crime was; but then he said it was so
great a Fault that it must be Punish'd: Besides,
the Man that talk'd to them, told them, that the
Great Master said, that he knew if he had Pardon'd
them, they would but be the Worse, for that the
<HI>Negroes</HI> were never thankful for being spar'd, and
that there were no other ways to make them Obe∣dient,
but Severity.</P>
<P>ONE of the poor Fellows, more sensible than
the other; answer'd, if any <HI>Negroe</HI> be Bader for
kindly us'd, they should be Whipped till they
were much<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> better, but that he never knew that,
for he never knew the <HI>Negroe</HI> be kindly use.</P>
<P>THIS was the same thing as the other had said,
and indeed, was but too true, for the Overseers
really knew no such thing as Mercy; and that
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
Notion of the <HI>Negroes</HI> being no other way to be
govern'd but by Cruelty, had been the Occasion,
that no other Method was ever try'd among them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if a slack Hand has been at any time
been held upon them; it had not been done with
Discretion, or as a point of Mercy; and manag'd
with the Assistance of Argument to convince the
<HI>Negroes</HI> of the Nature and Reason of it, and to
shew them what they ought to do in Return for
it: But it was perhaps the effect of Negligence,
ill Conduct, and want of Application to the Bu∣siness
of the Plantation; and then'twas no won∣der
that the <HI>Negroes</HI> took the Advantage of it.</P>
<P>WELL, I carried on the Affair with these two
<HI>Negroes,</HI> just as I did with <HI>Mouchat,</HI> so I need
not repeat the particulars, and they were deliver'd
with infinite Acknowledgments and Thanks, even
to all the Extravagancies of Joy usual in those
People on such Occasion; and such was the Gra∣titude
of those two pardon'd Fellows, that they
were the most Faithful, and most Diligent Ser∣vants
ever after, that belong'd to the whole Plan∣tation,
<HI>Mouchat</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>IN this manner I carried on the Plantation
fully to his Satisfaction; and before a Year more
was expir'd, there was scarse any such thing as
Correction known in the Plantation; except upon
a few Boys who were incapable of the Impressi∣ons,
that good Usuage would have made, even
upon them too, till they had liv'd to know the
Difference.</P>
<P>IT was some time after this Conference, that our
Great Master, <HI>as we call'd him,</HI> sent for me again to
his Dwelling-house, and told me he had, had an
Answer from <HI>England</HI> from his Friend, to whom
he had written about my Bill: I was a little
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
afraid that he was going to ask me leave to send
it to <HI>London:</HI> But he did not say any thing like
that: But told me that his Friend had been with
the Gentleman, and that he own'd the Bill, and
that he had all the Money in his Hand, that the
Bill had mention'd; but that he had promis'd the
young Man, that had given him the Money, (mean∣ing
me,) not to pay the Money to any Body but
himself, tho' they should bring the Bill; the
Reason of which was, that I did not know who
might get the Bill away from me.</P>
<P>BUT now, Col. <HI>Jack, says he,</HI> as you Wrote
him an Account where you was, and by what
wicked Arts you were Trapann'd; and that it
was impossible for you to have your Liberty till
you cou'd get the Money: My Friend at <HI>London</HI>
has written to me, that upon making out a due
Copy of the Bill here, attested by a notary, and
sent to him, and your Obligation likewise attest∣ed;
whereby you oblige your self to Deliver the
Original to his Order, after the Money is paid,
he will pay the Money.</P>
<P>I told him I was willing to do whatever his
Honour directed; and so the proper Copies were
drawn, as I had been told were requir'd.</P>
<P>BUT now, what will you do with this Money,
<HI>Jack? says he</HI> smiling, will you Buy your Liber∣ty
of me, and go to Planting?</P>
<P>I was too cunning for him, now, indeed, for I re∣member'd
what he had promis'd me; and I had
too much Knowledge of the Honesty of his Prin∣ciples,
as well as of the Kindness he had for me;
to doubt his being as good as his Word; so I
turn'd all this Talk of his upon him another way;
I knew that when he ask'd me if I would Buy
my Liberty and go to Planting, it was to try if
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
I would leave him; so, I said, as to buying my
Liberty, Sir, <HI>that is to say,</HI> going out of your Service,
I had much rather Buy more time in your Ser∣vice,
and I am only unhappy that I have but two
Year to serve.</P>
<P>COME, come, Col. <HI>says he,</HI> don't flatter me, I
love plain Dealing, Liberty is precious to every
Body; if you have a Mind to have your Money
brought over, you shall have your Liberty to be∣gin
for your self, and I will take care you shall
be well us'd by the Country, and get you a good
Plantation.</P>
<P>I still insisted, that I would not quit his Ser∣vice
for the best Planation in <HI>Maryland;</HI> that he
had been so good to me, and I believ'd I was so
useful to him, that I cou'd not think of it; and
at last, I added, I hop'd he cou'd not believe but
I had as much Gratitude as a <HI>Negro.</HI></P>
<P>HE smil'd, and said, he would not be serv'd
upon those Terms; that he did not forget what
he had promis'd, nor what I had done in his Plan∣tation;
and that he was resolv'd in the first place
to give me my Liberty, so he Pulls out a peiece
of Paper, and throws it to me, there, <HI>says he,</HI>
there's a Certificate of your coming on Shore, and
being Sold to me for five Years, of which you
have liv'd three with me, and now you are your
own Master.</P>
<P>I Bow'd, and told him, that I was sure if I was
my own Master, I would be his Servant as long
as he would accept of my Service; and now we
strain'd Courtifies; and he told me I should be
his Servant still: But it should be on two Condi∣tions.
(1.) That he would give me 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and my Board, for my managing the Plantation
I was then employ'd in; and (2.) That at the
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
same time he would procure me a new Planatation
to begin upon for my own Account; for Col.
<HI>Jack, says he,</HI> smiling, tho' you are but a young
Man, yet 'tis time you were doing something for
your self.</P>
<P>I answer'd, that I cou'd do little at a Plantati∣on
for my self, unless I Neglected his Business,
which I was resolv'd not to do on any Terms
whatever: But that I would serve him Faithfully
if he would accept of me as long as he liv'd: So
you shall, <HI>says he,</HI> again, and serve your self too;
and thus we parted for that time.</P>
<P>HERE I am to observe in the general, to
avoid dwelling too long upon a Story; that as the
two <HI>Negroes</HI> who I deliver'd from Punishment,
were ever after the most Diligent, and Laborious
poor Fellows in the whole Plantation, as above;
except <HI>Mouchat,</HI> of whom I shall speak more by
and by, so they not only were Grateful them∣selves
for their good usuage, but they Influenc'd
the whole Plantation: So that the Gentle usuage
and Lenity, with which they had been treat∣ed,
had a Thousand times more Influence
upon them, to make them Diligent, than all the
Blows and Kicks, Whippings, and other Tortures
could have, which they had been us'd to, and
now the Planation was famous for it; so that se∣veral
other Planters began to do the same, tho' I
cannot say it was with the same Success; which
might be for want of taking Pains with them,
and working upon their Passions in a right man∣ner;
it appeard that <HI>Negroes</HI> were to be reason'd
into things as well as other People, and it was
by thus managing their Reason, that most of the
Work was done.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197"/>
HOWEVER, (as it was) the Plantations in <HI>Mary∣land,</HI>
were the better for this Undertaking, and they
are to this Day less Cruel and Barbarous to their
<HI>Negroes,</HI> than they are in <HI>Barbados,</HI> and <HI>Jamica;</HI>
and 'tis observ'd the <HI>Negroes</HI> are not in these
Colonies so desperate, neither do they so often
run away, or so often Plot mischief against their
Master, as they do in those.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt the longer upon it, that if pos∣sible
Posterity might be perswaded to try gentler
Methods with those miserable Creatures, and to
use them with Humanity; assuring them, that if
they did so, adding the common Prudence that
every particular Case, would direct them to for
itself, the <HI>Negroes</HI> would do their Work fatihful∣ly,
and chearfully; they would not find any
of that refractoriness, and sullenness in their
Temper, that they pretend now to complain of;
but they would be the same as their Christian
Servants, except that they would be the more
Thankful and Humble, and Laborious of the Two.</P>
<P>I Continue'd in this Station between five and
six Year after this, and in all that time we had not
one <HI>Negroe</HI> whipp'd, except as I observ'd before,
now and then an unluckly Boy, and that only for
Triffles; I cannot say, but we had some ill-na∣tured
ungovernable <HI>Negroes;</HI> but if at any time
such Offended, they were Pardon'd the first Time,
in the manner as above; and the second Time were
ordered to be turn'd out of the Plantation; and this
was remarkable that they would Torment them∣selves
at the Apprehensions of being turn'd away,
more by a great deal, than if they had been to
be whipp'd, for then they were only Sullen and
Heavy; nay, at length we found the fear of be∣ing
turn'd out of the Plantation, had as much
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
Effect to Reform them, <HI>that is to say,</HI> make them
more diligent, than any Torture would have done;
and the Reason was Evident, namely, because
in our Plantation, they were us'd like Men, in
the other like Dogs.</P>
<P>MY Master own'd the Satisfaction, he took in
this blessed Change, as he call'd it, as long as he li∣ved,
and as he was so engag'd, by seeing the <HI>Negroes</HI>
Grateful, he shew'd the same Principle of Grati∣tude
to those that serv'd him, as he look'd for in
those that he serv'd; and particularly to me, and
so I come briefly to that Part: The first thing he
did after giving me my Liberty, <HI>as above,</HI> and
making me an allowance, was to get the Country
Bounty to me, that is to say, of a Quantity of
Land to begin, and Plant for myself.</P>
<P>BUT this he manag'd Away by himself, and
as I found afterwards took up, <HI>that is,</HI> purchased in
my Name, about 300 Acres of Land in a more con∣venient
Place, than it would have otherwise been
Allotted me; and this he did by his Interest with
the Lord Proprietor; so that I had an extent of
Ground mark'd out to me, not next, but very near
one of his own Plantations: When I made my
acknowledgement for this to him, he told me
plainly, that I was not beholding to him for it
at all; for he did it, that I might not be oblig'd
to neglect his Business for the carrying on my
own, and on that Account he would not reckon
to me what Money he paid, which however, ac∣cording
to the Custom of the Country was not
a very great Sum, I think about 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>THUS he very generously gave me my Liber∣ty,
advanc'd this Money for me, put me into a
Plantation for myself, and gave me 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
Wages for looking after one of his own Plan∣tations.</P>
<P>BUT Colonel, <HI>says he,</HI> to me, giving you this
Plantation is nothing at all to you, if I do not
assist you to support it, and to carry it o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and
therefore I will give you Credit for what over is
needful to you for the carrying it on; such
as Tools, Provisions for Servants, and some
Servants to begin; Materials to build Out-Houses,
and Conveniences of all Sorts for the
Plantation, and to buy Hogs, Cows, Horses
for Stock, and the like, and I'll take it out of
your Cargo, which will come from <HI>London,</HI> for
the Money of your Bill.</P>
<P>THIS was highly obliging and very kind, and
the more so, as it afterwards appear'd; in order
to this, he sent two Servants of his own, who
were Carpenters, as for Timber, Boards, Planks,
and all Sorts of such Things in a Country almost
all made of Wood, they could not be wanting: These
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un me up a little wooden House in less than three
Weeks time, where I had three Rooms, a Kit∣chin,
an Out-House, and two large Sheds at a di∣stance
from the House, for Store-houses, almost like
Barns, with Stables at the End of them; and thus
I was Set up in the World, and in Short, remo∣ved
by the degrees that you have heard from a
Pick-pocket, to a Kidnapp'd miserable Slave in
<HI>Virginia;</HI> (for <HI>Maryland,</HI> is <HI>Virginia,</HI> speaking of
them at a distance,) than from a Slave to a Head
Officer, and Overseer of Slaves, and from thence
to a Master Planter.</P>
<P>I HAD now as above, a House, a Stable, two
Ware-houses, and 300 Acres of Lano; but <HI>as we
say,</HI> bare Walls make g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddy Hussy's, so I had nei∣ther
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
Axe or Hatchet, to cut down<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note</HI> all the Land before it is plan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed is over grown with high Trees, which must be cut down, and grubb'd up, before any thing call'd Planting can be begun.</NOTE> the Trees;
Horse, or Hog, or Cow to put upon the Land;
not a Hoe, or a Spade to break Ground, nor a
Pair of Hands, but my own to go to Work upon it.</P>
<P>BUT Heaven and kind Masters, make up all
those things to a diligent Servant; and I menti∣on
it, because People, who are either Transport∣ed,
or otherwise Trappan'd into those Places, are
generally thought to be rendered miserable, and
undone; whereas, on the contrary, I would en∣courage
them upon my own Experience to de∣pend
upon it, that if their own Diligence in the
time of Service, gains them but a good Character,
which it will certainly do, if they can
deserve it, there is not the poorest, and most de∣spicable
Felon that ever went over, but may
after his time is serv'd, begin for himself, and may
in time be sure of raising a good Plantation.</P>
<Q><P>FOR Example, I will now take a Man in the
meanest Circumstances of a Servant, who
has serv'd out his 5 or 7 Years, (suppose a
Transported Wretch for 7 Years.) The cu∣stom
of the Place was then (what it is since
I know not) that on his Master's certifying
that he had serv'd his time out faithfully he
had 50 Acres of Land allotted him, for
Planting, and on this Plan he begins.</P>
<P>SOME had a Horse, a Cow, and three Hogs
given, or rather lent them as a Stock for
the Land, which they made an allowance
for, at a certain Time and Rate.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="195" REF="201"/>
CUSTOM has made it a Trade, to give Credit
to such Beginners as these, for Tools, Cloths,
Nails, Iron-work, and other things ne∣cessary
for their Planting; and which the
Persons so giving Credit to them, are to be
paid for out of the Crop of <HI>Tobacco</HI> which they
shall Plant; nor is it in the Debtors power
to Defraud the Creditor of Payment in that
manner; and as <HI>Tobacco</HI> is their Coin, as
well as their Product; so all things are to be
Purchas'd at a certain quantity of <HI>Tobacco,</HI>
the Price being so Rated.</P>
<P>THUS the naked Planter has Credit at his Be∣ginning,
and immediately goes to Work, to
cure the Land, and Plant <HI>Tobacco;</HI> and from
this little Beginning, have some of the most
considerable Planters in <HI>Virginia</HI> and in <HI>Mary∣land</HI>
also, rais'd themselves, namely, from
being without a Hat, or a Shoe, to Estates of 40
or 50000 Pound; and in this Method, I may
add, no Diligent Man ever Miscarried, if he
had Health to Work, and was a good Husband;
for he every Year encreases a little, and
every Year adding more Land, and Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
more <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which is real Money, he must
Gradually encrease in Substance, till at
length he gets enough to Buy <HI>Negroes,</HI> and
other Servants, and then never Works him∣self
any more.</P>
<P>IN a Word, every <HI>Newgate</HI> Wretch, every De∣sperate
forlorn Creature; the most Despica∣ble
ruin'd Man in the World, has here a fair
Opportunity put into his Hands to begin the
World again, and that upon a Foot of certain
Gain, and in a Method exactly Honest; with
a Reputation, that nothing past will have
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
any Effect upon; and innumerable People
have thus rais'd themselves from the worst
Circumstance in the World; Namely, from
the <HI>Condemn'd-Hole</HI> in <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I Return to my own Story, I was now a
Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, and encourag'd by a kind Benefactor,
for, that I might not be wholly taken up with my
new Plantation, he gave me freely, and without
any Consideration my grateful Negro <HI>Mouchat:</HI>
He told me it was a Debt due to the Affection
that poor Creature had always had for me; and
so indeed, it was, for as the Fellow would once
have been Hang'd for me, so now, and to his last
he lov'd me so much, that it was apparent he did
every thing with Pleasure that he did for me;
and he was so overcome of Joy when he heard he
was to be my <HI>Negro,</HI> that the People in the Plan∣tation
really thought it would turn his Head, and
that the Fellow would go Distracted.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he sent me two Servants more,
a Man and a Woman, but these he put to my
Account, as above: <HI>Mouchat,</HI> and these two fell
immediately to Work for me; and they began
with about 2 Acres of Land, which had but little
Timber on it at first, and most of that was Cut
down by the two <HI>Carpenters</HI> who built my House,
(or shed, rather, for so it should be call'd.)</P>
<P>THESE two Acres I got in good Forwardness,
and most of it well Planted with <HI>Tobacco;</HI> tho'
some of it we were oblig'd to plant with Garden
Stuff for Food; such as Potatoes, Carrots, Cab∣bages,
Peas, Beans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT was a great Advantage to me, that I had
so Bountiful a Master, who help'd me out in every
Case; for in this very first Year I receiv'd a Ter∣rible
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
Blow, for my Bill as I have observ'd, ha∣ving
been Coppy'd, and Attested in Form, and
sent to <HI>London:</HI> My kind Friend and <HI>Custom house</HI>
Gentleman paid me the Money; and the Mer∣chant
at <HI>London,</HI> by my Good Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs Direction,
had laid it all out in a sorted Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ods for
me, such as would have made a Man of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all at
once; but to my Inexpressible T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rror and Sur∣prize,
the Ship was L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and that just at the En∣trance
into the Capes, <HI>that is to say,</HI> the Mouth
of the Bay; some of the Goods were recover'd,
but spoil'd, and in short, nothing but the Nails,
Tools, and Iron-work were good for any thing,
and tho' the Value of them was pretty Consi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rable
in Proportion to the rest, yet, my loss was
irreparably Great, and indeed, the Greatness of
the loss to me consisted in its being Irreparable.</P>
<P>I was perfectly Asto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish'd at the first News of
the loss, knowing that I was in Debt to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pa∣tron,
or Master, so much, that it must be several
Years before I should recover it; and as he brought
me the bad News himself, he perceiv'd my Dis∣order,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> he saw I was in the ut∣most
Confusion, and a kind of Amazement, and
so indeed, I was, because I was so much in Debt;
But he spoke Chearfully to me; come, <HI>says he,</HI> do
not be so Discourag'd, you may make up this
Loss: No, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> that never can be, for 'tis my
all, and I shall never be out of Debt; well, <HI>says he,</HI>
you have no Creditor, however, but me, and now
remember, I once told you, I would make a Man
of you, and I will not Disappoint you for this
Dissaster.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and did it with more Ceremony
and Respect than ever; because I thought my self
more under the Hatches than I was before. But
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
he was as good as his Word, for he did not Baulk
me in the least of any thing I wanted, and as I
had more Iron-work sav'd out of the Ship, in pro∣portion,
than I wanted, I supplied him with
some part of it, and took up some Linnen, and
Cloaths, and other Necessaries from him in Ex∣change.</P>
<P>AND now I began to encrease Visibly; I had
a large Quantity of Land Cur'd, <HI>that is,</HI> Freed
from Timber; and a very good Crop of <HI>Tobacco</HI>
in view, and I got three Servants more, and one
<HI>Negroe;</HI> so that I had five white Servants, and two
<HI>Negroes,</HI> and with this my Affairs went very
well on.</P>
<P>THE first Year, indeed, I took my Wages, or
Sallary, <HI>that is to say,</HI> of 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, because I
wanted it very much; but the second and third
Year I resolv'd not to take it, on any Account
whatsoever, but to leave it in my Benefactors
Hands, to clear off the Debt I had Contracted.</P>
<P>AND now I must Impose a short Digression on
the Reader, to Note, That notwithstanding all the
Disadvantages of a most wretched Education, yet
Now when I began to feel my self, as I may say,
in the World; and to be arriv'd to an Independant
State, and to foresee, that I might be something
Considerable in time; I say, Now I found differing
Sentiments of things taking Place in my Mind;
and first, I had a solid Principle of Justice and
Honesty, and a secret Horror at things pass'd,
when I look'd back upon my former Life: That
Original something, I knew not what, that used
formerly to Check me in the first meannesses of
my Youth, and us'd to Dictate to me when I was
but a Child, that I was to be a Gentleman, con∣tinued
to Operate upon me Now, in a manner I
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
cannot Describe; and I continually remember'd
the Words of the ancient <HI>Glass-maker,</HI> to the Gen∣tleman,
that he reprov'd for Swearing, that to be
a Gentleman, was to be an <HI>Honest Man,</HI> that with∣out
Honesty, Human Nature was Sunk and Dege∣nerated;
the Gentleman lost all the Dig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty
of his Birth, and plac'd himself, even below an
Honest Beggar: These Principles growing upon
my Mind in the present Circumstances I was in,
gave me a secret Satisfaction, that I can give no
Description of; it was an inexpressible Joy to me,
that I was now like to be, not only a Man, but
an Honest Man; and it yielded me a greater Plea∣sure,
that I was Ransom'd from being a Vagabond,
a Thief, and a Criminal, as I had been from a
Child, than that I was deliver'd from Slavery,
and the wretched State of a <HI>Virginia</HI> Sold Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vant:
I had Notion enough in my Mind, of the Hard∣ships
of the Servant, or Slave, because I had felt
it, and Work'd thro' it; I remember'd it as a
State of Labour and Servitude, Hardship and
Suffering. But the other shock'd my very Na∣ture,
chil'd my Blood, and turn'd the very Soul
within me: The thought of it was like Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lections
upon Hell, and the Damn'd Spirits; it struck me
with Horror, it was Odious and Frightful to look
back on, and it gave me a kind of a Fit, a Con∣vulsion
or nervous Disorder, that was very uneasy
to me.</P>
<P>BUT to look forward, to Reflect, how things
were Chang'd; how Happy I was, that I cou'd
live by my own Endeavours, and was no more
under the Necessity of being a Villain, and of
getting my Bread at my own Hazard, and the
Ruin of Honest Families; this had in it something
more than commonly pleasing and agreeable, and
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
in particular, it had a Pleasure, that till then I
had known nothing of: It was a sad thing to be
under a N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessity of doing Evil, to procure that sub∣sistance,
which I could not Support the want of,
to be oblig'd to run the venture of the Gallows,
rather than the venture of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arving, and to be
always wick'd, for fear of want.</P>
<P>I cannot say that I had any serious Religious
reflections, or that these things proceeded yet from
the uneasiness of Conscience, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut from meer Rea∣sonings
with myself, and from being arriv'd to a
Capacity of making a right Judgement of things
more than before; yet I own I had such an ab∣horrence
of the wicked Life I had led, that I
was secretly easie, and had a kind of Pleasure in
the Dissaster that was upon me about the Ship,
and that tho' it was a loss I could not but be glad,
that those ill gotten Goods were gone, and that I had
lost what I had stolen; for I look'd on it as none
of mine, and that it would be fire in my Flax if
I should mingle it with what I had now, which
was come honestly by, and was as it were sent
from Heaven, to lay the Foundation of my pros∣perity,
which the other would be only as a Moth
to consume.</P>
<P>AT the same time my Thoughts dictated to me,
that tho' this was the Foundation of my new Life,
yet that this was not the Superstructure, and that
I might still be born for greater things than these;
that it was Honesty, and Virtue alone that made
Men Rich and Great, and gave them a Fame, as
well as a Figure in the World, and that there∣fore
I was to lay my Foundation in these, and
expect what might follow in time.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207"/>
To help these Thoughts, as I had learn'd to
Read, and Write when I was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> so I
began now to love Books, and particularly I had
an Opportunity of Reading some very consider∣able
Ones; such as <HI>Livy's</HI> Roman History, the
History of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> History of <HI>Speed,</HI>
and others; the History of the <HI>Low Country</HI> Wars,
the History of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
and the History of the <HI>Spaniard's</HI> Conquest
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> with several others, some of which I
bought at a Planter's House, who was lately
dead, and his Goods sold, and others I borrowed.</P>
<P>I consider'd my present State of Life to be my
meer Youth, tho' I was now above 30 Year old,
because in my Youth, I had learn'd nothing;
and if my daily Business which was now great,
would have permitted, I would have been content
to have gone to School; however, Fate that had
yet something else in Store for me, threw an Op∣portunity
into my Hand; namely, a cleverFellow,
that came over a transported Felon, from <HI>Bristol,</HI>
and fell into my Hands for a Servant: He had led
a loose Life, that he acknowledged, and being
driven to Extremities took to the Highway, for
which, had he been taken, he would have been
Hang'd, but falling into some low priz'd Rogue∣ries
afterwards for want of Opportunity for worse,
was catch'd, Condemn'd, and Transported, and
as, <HI>he said,</HI> was glad he came off so.</P>
<P>HE was an excellent Schollar, and I perceiving
it, ask'd him one time, if he could give a Method how
I might learn the Latin Tongue? <HI>He said,</HI> smiling,
yes, he could Teach it me in three Months, if I would
let him have Books, or even without Books, if
he had time; I told him, a Book would become
his Hands better than a Hoe, and if he could pro∣mise
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
to make me but understand Latin enough
to read it, and understand other Languages
by it, I would ease him of the Labour, which I
was now oblig'd to put him to, especially, if I
was assur'd that he was fit to receive that Favour
of a kind Master: In short, I made him to me,
what my Benefactor made me to him, and from
him I gain'd a Fund of Knowledge, infinitely
more valuable than the Rate of a Slave, which
was what I paid for it, but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>WITH these Thoughts I went chearfully about
my Work: As I had now five Servants, my Plan∣tation
went on, tho' gently, yet safely, and en∣creas'd
gradually; tho' slowly; but the third
Year with the Assistance of my old Benefactor,
I purchas'd two <HI>Negroes</HI> more, so that now I had
seven Servants, and having cur'd Land sufficient
for supply of their Food, I was at no difficulty
to maintain them, so that my Plantation be∣gan
now to enlarge itself, and as I liv'd without
any Personal Expence, but was maintain'd at
my old Great Master's, <HI>as we call'd him,</HI> and at
his Charge, with 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year besides, so all my
Gain was laid up for Encrease.</P>
<P>IN this Posture I went on for 12 Year, and was
very successful in my Plantation, and had got∣ten
by means of my Master's favour, who now
I call'd my Friend, a Correspondent in <HI>London,</HI>
with whom I Traded, Shipp'd over my Tobacco,
to him, and receiv'd <HI>European</HI> Goods in returns
such as I wanted, to carry on my Plantation, and
sufficient to sell to others also.</P>
<P>IN this interval, my good Friend and Bene∣factor
died, and I was left very disconsolate, on ac∣count
of my Loss, for it was indeed a great Loss to
me; he had been a Father to me, and I was like a
forsaken Stranger without him, tho' I knew the
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
Country, and the Trade too well enough, and
had for sometime chiefly carried on his whole
Business for him, yet I seem'd now at a loss; my
Councellor, and my chief Supporter was gone,
and I had no Confident to communicate myself
to, on all Occasions, as formerly; but there was
no Remedy, I was however in a better Conditi∣on
to stand alone than ever; I had a very large
Plantation, and had near 70 <HI>Negroes,</HI> and other
Servants: In a Word, I was grown really Rich,
considering my first Circumstances that began,
<HI>as I may say,</HI> with nothing: <HI>That is to say,</HI> I had
nothing of Stock, but I had a great Beginning,
for I had such a Man's Friendship, and Support
in my Beginning, that indeed, I needed no other
Stock, and if I had had 500<HI>l.</HI> to have begun with,
and not the Assistance, Advice, and Counte∣nance
of such a Man, I had not been in a better
Condition; but he promis'd to make a Man of
me, and so he did, and in one Respect, <HI>I may say,</HI>
I merited it of him, for I brought his Plantation
into such order, and the Government of his <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI>
into such a Regulation, that if he had given
500<HI>l.</HI> to have had it done, he would have thought
his Money well bestow'd; his Work was always
in order going forward to his Mind; every thing
was in a thriving Posture; his Servants all lov'd
him, even <HI>Negroes</HI> and all, and yet there was no
such thing, as a cruel Punishment, or Severities
known among them.</P>
<P>IN my own Plantation it was the same thing,
I wrought so upon the Reason, and the Affections
of my <HI>Negroes,</HI> that they serv'd me chearfully,
and by Consequence, Faithfully, and Diligently;
when in my Neighbour's Plantation, there was
not a Week hardly pass'd without such horrible
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
Out-cryes, Roarings and Yellings of the Servants,
either under Torture, or in Fear of it, that their
<HI>Negroes</HI> would in Discourse with ours, wish them∣selves
dead, and gone, (as it seems they believ'd
they should after Death) into their own Country.</P>
<P>IF I met with a sullen stupid Fellow, at some∣times
it was unavoidable, I always parted with
him, and sold him off; for I would not keep any,
that Sense of kind Usage would not oblige; but
I seldom met with such bad ones, for by talking to
them in a plain Reasoning way, I found the
Temper of the Roughest of them, would break
and soften; the Sense of their own Interest would
prevail with them first, or last; and if it had
not, the contrary Temper was so general among
my People, that their own Fellows and Country∣men
would be against them, and that serv'd to
bring them to Reason, as soon as any other thing;
and this, those who think it worth their while,
will easily find, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that having prevail'd Ef∣fectually
over one leading Man among them to
be tractable, and pleas'd, and grateful, he shall
make them all like him, and that in a little
while, with more ease than can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>I WAS now a Planter, and also a Student; my
Pedagogue I mention'd above, was very diligent,
and prov'd an extraordinary Man indeed, he
Taught me not only with Application, but with
admirable Judgement in the Teaching part, for
I have seen it in many Instances since that time,
that every good Schollar is not fitted for a School∣master,
and that the Art of Teaching is quite
different from that of Knowing the Language
Taught.</P>
<P>BUT this Man had both, and prov'd of great
Use to me, and I sound Reason in the worth of
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
the Person to be very kind to him, his Circum∣stances
consider'd: I once took the liberty to ask
him how it came to pass, that he who must have had
a liberal Education, and great Advantages to have
advanc'd himself in the World, should be capable
of falling into such miserable Circumstances as he
was in, when he came over? I us'd some Caution
in entring upon an enquiry, which, <HI>as I said,</HI>
might not be pleasant to him to relate, but that
I would make him amends, by telling him, that
if he desir'd not to enter into it with me, I would
readily excuse him, and would not take it ill at
all; this I did, because to a Man under such Af∣flictions,
one should always be Tender, and
not put them upon relating any thing of them∣selves,
which was grievous to them, or which
they had rather was conceal'd.</P>
<P>BUT he told me, that it was true, that to look
back upon his past Life, was indeed <HI>renovare do∣lorem;</HI>
but that such Mortifications were now use∣ful
to him, to help forward that Repentance
which he hop'd he was sincerely entered upon;
and that tho' it was with horror he look'd back
upon mispent Time, and ill applied Gifts, which
a bountiful Creator had bless'd him with, and
spar'd to him for a better Improvement, yet he
thought he ought to load himself with as much of
the shame, as it pleas'd God to make his Lot, since
he had already loaded himself with the Guilt in a
shameless manner; till God (he still hop'd in Mer∣cy
to him) had cut him short, and brought him
to publick Disgrace, tho' he could not say he
had been brought to Justice, for then he had been
sent into Eternity in despair, and not been sent
to <HI>Virginia,</HI> to repent of the wickedest Life that
ever Man liv'd:—He would have gone on,
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
but, I found his Speech interrupted by a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sio∣nate
struggle within, between his Grief and his
Tears.</P>
<P>I took no more Notice of it, than to tell him,
that I was sorry I had ask'd him about it, but
that it was my Curiosity; when I saw that igno∣rant,
untaught, untractable Creatures come into
Misery and Shame, I made no enquiry after their
Affairs, but when I saw Men of Parts and Learn∣ing
take such Steps, I concluded it must be oc∣casion'd
by something exceeding wicked; so in∣deed,
<HI>said he,</HI> the Judge said to me when I beg'd
Mercy of him in Latin, he told me that when a
Man furnish'd with such Learning falls into such
Crimes, he is more inexcusable than other Men;
because his Learning recommending him, he could
not want Advantages, and had the less temptation
to Crime.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> I believe my Case was what
I find is the Case of most of the wicked Part of
the World (<HI>viz.</HI>) that to be reduc'd to Necessity
is to be wicked; for Necessity is not only the
Temptation, but is such a Temptation as human
Nature is not empower'd to resist: How good then,
<HI>says he,</HI> is that God, which takes from you Sir, the
Temptation, by taking away the Necessity?</P>
<P>I was so sensible of the Truth of what he said,
<HI>knowing it by my own Case,</HI> that I could not enter
any farther upon the Discourse; but he went
on voluntarily: <HI>This Sir,</HI> says he, I am so sensi∣ble
of, that I think the Case I am now reduc'd to,
much less miserable than the Life which I liv'd
before, because I am deliver'd from the horrid
Necessity of doing such ill things, which was my
Ruin, and Dissaster then, even for my Bread,
and am not now oblig'd to ravish my Bread out
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
of the Mouths of others by Violence and Disor∣der;
but am fed tho' I am made to Earn it by the
hard Labour of my Hands, and I thank God for
the Difference. He paws'd here but went on thus,</P>
<P>How much is the Life of a Slave in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to
be preferr'd to that of the most prosperous Thief
in the World! here I live miserable, but honest;
suffer wrong, but do no wrong; my Body is pu∣nish'd,
but my Conscience is not loaded; and as
I us'd to say, that I had no Leisure to look in,
but I would begin when I had some Recess, some∣time
to spare; now God has found me leisure to
Repent; he run on in this manner a great while,
giving Thanks, I believe most heartily, for his
being deliver'd from the wretch'd Life he had
liv'd, tho' his Misery were to be ten Fold, as
much as it was.</P>
<P>I WAS sincerely Touch'd with his Discourse
on this Subject, I had known so much of the
real difference of the Case, that I could not but
be affected with it, tho' till now I confess I knew
little of the religious Part: I had been an Offen∣der
as well as he, tho' not altogether in the same
Degree, but I knew nothing of the Penitence;
neither had I look'd back upon any thing, as a
Crime; but as a Life dishonourable, and not
like a Gentleman, which run much in my
Thoughts, as I have several times mention'd.</P>
<P>WELL, but now, <HI>says I,</HI> you talk Penitently,
and I hope you are sincere, but what would be
your Case, if you were deliver'd from the mise∣rable
Condition of a Slave sold for Money, which
you are now in? should you not, think you, be
the same Man?</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214"/>
BLESSED be God, <HI>says he,</HI> that if I thought I
should, I would sincerely pray that I might not
be Deliver'd, and that I might for ever be a Slave
rather than a Sinner.</P>
<P>WELL, but <HI>says I,</HI> suppose you to be under the
same necessity, in the same starving Condition,
Should you not take the same Course?</P>
<P>HE replied very sharply, that shows us the
need we have of the Petition in the Lord's Pray∣er:
<HI>Lead us not into Temptation;</HI> and of <HI>Solomon's</HI>
or <HI>Agar's</HI> Prayer: <HI>Give me not Poverty, least I
Steal.</HI> I should ever beg of God not to be left
to such Snares as Human Nature cannot resist.
But I have some hope that I should venture to
Starve, rather than to Steal; but I also beg to be
deliver'd from the Danger, because I know not
my own Strength.</P>
<P>THIS was honestly spoken, indeed; and there
really were such visible Tokens of Sincerity in all
his Discourse, that I could not suspect him: On
some of our Discourses on this Subject, he pull'd
out a little Dirty Paper Book, in which he had
wrote down such a Prayer in Verse, as I doubt
few Christians in the World could Subscribe to;
and I cannot but Record it, because I never saw any
thing like it in my Life, the Lines are as follows:
<Q><L>Lord! whatsoever Sorrows Rack my Breast,</L>
<L>Till Crime removes too, let me find no Rest;</L>
<L>How Dark so e'er, my State, or sharp my Pain,</L>
<L>O: let not Troubles Cease, and Sin Remain.</L></Q>
<Q><L>For Jesus sake, remove not my Distress,</L>
<L>Till free Triumphant Grace shall Reposess</L>
<L>The Vacant Throne, from whence my Sins Depart,</L>
<L>And make a willing Captive of my Heart;</L>
<L>Till Grace Compleatly shall my Soul Subdue,</L>
<L>Thy Conquest-full, and my Subjection True.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215"/>
THERE were more Lines on the same Subject,
but these were the beginning; and these touching
me so sensibly, I have remember'd them distinct∣ly
ever since, and have I believe repeated them
to my self a Thousand times.</P>
<P>I press'd him no more you may be sure, after
an answer so very particular, and affecting as
this was; it was easy to see the Man was a sin∣cere
Penitent, not sorrowing for the Punishment
he was suffering under; for his Condition was no
part of his Affection, he was rather thankful for
it, as above; but his Concern was a feeling and
affecting Sence of the Wicked and Abominable
Life he had led, the abhorr'd Crimes he had Com∣mitted,
both against God and Man, and the little
Sence he had had of the Condition he was in, that
even till he came to the Place where he now was.</P>
<P>I ask'd him if he had no Reflections of this kind,
after, or before his Sentence, he told me, <HI>Newgate,
for the Prison at</HI> Bristol <HI>is call'd, so it seems, as well
as that at</HI> London, was a place that seldom made
Penitents, but often made Villains worse, till they
learn'd to defie God and Devil. But, that how∣ever,
he cou'd look back with this Satisfaction;
that he could say, he was not altogether insensi∣ble
of it, even then; but nothing that amounted
to a thorough Serious looking up to Heaven: That
he often indeed look'd in, and reflected upon his
past mispent Life, even before he was in Pri∣son,
when the Intervals of his wicked Pra∣ctises
gave some time for Reflection, and he would
sometimes say to himself, Whether am I going?
To what, will all these things bring me at last?
And where will they End? Sin and Shame follow
one another, and I shall certainly come to the
Gallows; <HI>then said he,</HI> I wou'd strike upon my
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
Breast, and say: O wicked Wretch, when wilt
thou Repent! And would answer my self as of∣ten;
Never! Never! Never! Except it be in a
Goal, or at a Gib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>said he,</HI> I would Weep, and Sigh, and look
back a little upon my wretched Life, the Hi∣story
of which would make the World amaz'd;
but Alas! the prospect was so Dark, and it fill'd
me with so much Terror, that I cou'd not bear it;
then, I would fly to Wine and Company for re∣lief,
that Wine brought on Excess, and that Com∣pany
being always wicked Company like my self,
brought on Temptation; and then all Reflection
Vanish'd, and I was the same Devil as before.</P>
<P>HE spoke this with so much Affection, that
his Face was ever smiling, when he talk'd of
it, and yet his Eyes had Tears standing in
them, at the same time, and all the time; for he
had a delightful Sorrow, if that be a proper Ex∣pression,
in speaking of it.</P>
<P>THIS was a strange Relation to me, and began
to affect me after a manner that I did not un∣derstand;
I lov'd to hear him talk of it, and yet it
always left a kind of a Dead Lump behind it
upon my Heart, which I cou'd give no Reason for,
nor imagine to what it should tend; I had a hea∣viness
on my Soul without being able to describe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it, or to say, what ailed me.</P>
<P>WELL, he went on with his Relation, after
this, <HI>says he,</HI> I fell into the Hands of Justice for
a Triffle, a peice of Sport in our Crime; and I,
that for a hundred Robberies, as well on the
Highway, as otherwise, the particulars of which
would fill a Book to give an Account of, ought,
whenever I was taken to be Hang'd in Chams,
and who, if it had been Publick, could not have
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
fail'd of having Twenty People come in against
me, was privately Hurried into a Country Goal,
under a wrong Name; try'd for a small Fact
within Benefit of Clergy, and in which I was not
principally Guilty, and by this means obtained
the favour of being Transported.</P>
<P>AND what think you, <HI>said he,</HI> has most sensibly
affected me, and brought on the blessed Change
that I hope I may say, God has wrought in my
Soul: Not the Greatness of my Crimes, but the
Wonders of that merciful Providence, which when
it has Mercy in store for a Man, often brings him
into the Briars, into Sorrow and Misery for lesser
Sins; that Men may be led to see how they are spar'd
from the Punishment due to them, for the great∣er
Guilt which they know lies upon them; do you
think that when I receiv'd the Grant of Transpor∣tation,
I cou'd be insensible what a Miracle of
Divine Goodness such a thing must be, to one
who had so many ways deserv'd to be Hang'd,
and must infallibly have Died, if my true Name
had been known, or if the least Notice had been
given, that it was such a Notorious Wretch as I,
that was in Custody? There began the first Mo∣tive
of Repentance, for certainly the Goodness of
our Great Creator in sparing us, when we forfeit
our Lives to his Justice, and his Merciful bring∣ing
us out of the Miseries which we Plunge
ourselves into, when we have no way to Extri∣cate
ourselves, his bringing those very Miseries
to be the means of our Deliverance, and working
Good to us out of Evil, when we are working the
very Evil out of his Good: I say, these things are
certainly the strongest Motives to Repentance
that are in the World; and the sparing Theives
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
from the Gallows, certainly makes more Peni∣tents
than the Gallows it self.</P>
<P>IT is true, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> that the Terror of Pu∣nishment
works strongly upon the Mind: In
view of Death, Men are fill'd with Horror of
Soul, and immediately they call that Repentance
which I doubt is too often mistaken; being only
a kind of Anguish in the Soul, which breeds a
Grief for the Punishment that is to be suffer'd;
an Amazement founded upon the dreadful View
of what is to follow: But the Sense of Mercy
is quite another thing, this Seizes all the Passi∣ons,
and all the Affections, and Works a sincere
Unfeigned Abhorrence of the Crime, as a Crime;
as an Offence against our Benefactor, as an Act
of Baseness and Ingratitude to him, who has gi∣ven
us Life, and all the Blessings and Comforts
of Life; and who has Conquer'd us by continu∣ing
to do us good, when he has been Provok'd to
destroy us.</P>
<P>THIS, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> has been the Fountain of
that Repentance, which I so much Rejoyce in:
This is the delightful Sorrow, <HI>says he,</HI> that I spoke
of just now; and this makes Smiles sit on my
Face, while Tears run from my Eyes; a Joy that
I can no otherwise Express, than by telling you,
Sir, that I never liv'd a happy Day since I came
to an Age of acting in the World, till I Landed
in this Country, and work'd in your Plantation:
Naked and Hungry, Weary and Faint, op∣press'd
with Cold in one Season, and Heat in the
other; then I began to see into my own ways,
and see the Difference between the Hardships of
the Body, and the Torment of the Mind: Before
I Revell'd in fulness, and here, I struggl'd with
hard fare; then I wallow'd in Sloth and Volup∣tuous
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
Ease; here, I labour'd till Nature sometimes
was just sinking under the Load; but with this
Difference in the Felicity of either Case; Namely,
that there I had a Hell in my Soul, was fill'd with
Horror and Confusion, was a daily Terror to my
self, and always expected a miserable End;
Whereas here, I had a bless'd Calm of Soul, an
Emblem, and fore-runner of Heaven: Thankful
and Humble, adoring that Mercy that had snatch'd
me out of the Jaws of the Devil; these took up
my Thoughts, and made my most weary Hours
Pleasant to me, my Labour light, and my Heart
Chearful; I never lay down on my hard Lodging,
but I prais'd God with the greatest Excess of
Affection, not only, that it was not the <HI>Condemn'd-Hole;</HI>
and that I was delivered from the Death I
had deserv'd; But that it was not <HI>Shooters hill,</HI>
that I was not still a Robber, a Terror to Just and
honest Men; a Plunderer of the Innocent, and the
Poor; a Thief, and a Villain, that ought to be
Rooted out from the Earth, for the Safety of o∣thers;
But that I was deliver'd from the horrid
Temptation of Sinning, to Support my Luxury,
and making one Vice Necessary to another; and
this I bear Witness, is sufficient to Sweeten the
bitterest Sorrow, and make any Man be thankful
for <HI>Virginia,</HI> or a worse Place, if that can be.</P>
<P>HE then entertain'd me with an Opinion of his,
that if it were possible for the Face of Heaven and
Hell to be Disclos'd and laid open, and that Men
could be made capable of seeing distinctly, and
separately, the Joys and Glory, and utmost Fe∣licity
of One, and the Horrors of the Other;
and to make a Judgment of both, according to
the Power of human Reasoning, the first would
have a stronger and more powerful Effect to Re∣from
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
the World, than the latter: But this we
had farther about Discourses on many Occasions.</P>
<P>IF it should be enquir'd, how I was capable of
hearing all this, and having no Impressions made
upon my Mind by it, especially, when it so ma∣ny
ways suited my own Case, and the Conditi∣on
of the former part of my Life; I shall answer
that presently by it self: However, I took no
notice of it to him, for he had quite other Noti∣ons
of me, than I had of my self; nor did I, as is
usual in such Cases, enter into any Confidence
with him on my <HI>own</HI> Story, only that I took some∣times
the Occasion to let him know, that I did
not come over to <HI>Virginia</HI> in the Capacity of a
Criminal, or that I was not Transported; which
considering how many of the Inhabitants there
were so, who then liv'd in good Circumstances,
was needful enough to be done.</P>
<P>BUT as to my self it was enough, that I was
in Condition now, 'twas no matter to any Body,
what I had been, and as it was grown pretty
much out of Memory, from what original
dissaster, I came into the Country, or that I was
ever a Servant, otherwise than Voluntary, and that
it was no Business of mine to expose myself; so I
kept that Part close; but for all that, it was im∣possible
for me to conceal the Disorder I was in,
as often as he talk'd of these things; I had hi∣therto
gone on upon a Notion of things founded
only in their appearance, as they affected me with
Good, or Evil; esteeming, the happy and unhap∣py
Part of Life to be those that gave me Ease,
or Sorrow, without regarding, or indeed much un∣derstanding
how far those Turns of Life were
influenced by the giver of Life; or how far they
were all directed by a Sovereign God, that Go∣verns
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
the World, and all the Creatures it had
made.</P>
<P>As I had no Education but as you have heard,
so I had had no Instruction, no Knowledge of
Religion, or indeed of the meaning of it; and
tho' I was now in a kind of search after Religi∣on,
it was a meer looking, <HI>as it were,</HI> into the
World to see what kind of a thing, or Place it
was, and what had been done in it; but as to
him that made it, there had truly been scarce
a Creature among all he had made, with Souls in
them, that were so intirely without the know∣ledge
of God as I was, and made so little en∣quiry
about it.</P>
<P>BUT the serious affectionate Discourse of this
young Man, began to have different Effects
upon me; and I began to say to myself, this
Man's reflections are certainly very just, but what
a Creature am I, and what have I been doing?
I that never once did this in all my Life! that ne∣ver
said so much, <HI>God, I thank thee</HI> for all that
I have been sav'd from, or all that I have
been brought to in this World; and yet my Life
has been as full of Variety, and I have been as
miraculously deliver'd from Dangers and Mis∣chiefs,
and as many of them, as ever he has; and
if it has all been brought to pass by an invisible
Hand in Mercy to me, what have I been doing,
and where have I liv'd? that I only should be
the most Thoughtless, and Unthankful of all
God's Creatures!</P>
<P>THIS indeed began to grow upon me, and
made me very melancholly; but as to Religion, I
understood so little about it, that if I had re∣solv'd
upon any such thing, as a new Course of
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
Life, or to set about a religious Change, I knew
not at which End to begin, or what to do about it.</P>
<P>ONE Day it happen'd, that my Tutor, for so
I always call'd him, had the Bible in his Hand,
and was looking in it, as he generally did many
times every Day, tho' I knew not for what, seeing
the Bible, I took it out of his Hands, and went
to look in it; which I had done so little before, that
I think I might safely say, I had never read a
Chapter in it, in all my Life; he was talking of
the Bible then, as a Book only; as where he had it,
and how he brought it to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and in some exta∣sie,
he took it, and kiss'd: This blessed Book! <HI>says he,</HI>
this was all the Treasure I brought out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
with me, and a comfortable Treasure, it
has been to me, <HI>added he,</HI> I would not have been
without it in my Sorrows, for any other Trea∣sure
in the World, and so he went on at Large.</P>
<P>I THAT had no Notion of what he meant, only,
<HI>as I have said above,</HI> some Young Infant Thoughts,
about the Works of Providence in the World,
and its merciful Dealings with me, took the Book
out of his Hand, and went to look into it, and
the Book open'd at the <HI>Acts</HI> 26. v. 28. where <HI>Falix</HI>
says to <HI>St.</HI> Paul, <HI>almost thou perswadest me to be a
Christian.</HI> I think, <HI>says I,</HI> here's a Line hits me to
a Tittle, upon the long Account, you have given
of yourself, and I must say them to you, as the
Governor here said; and so I read the Words to
him. He blush'd at the Text, and returns, I wish
I could answer you in the very Words the Apostle
return'd to him in the next Ver. <HI>I would thou wert
both almost, and altogether such as I am, except
these Bonds.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS now more than Thirty Year old, by my
own Account, and as well as it was possible for me
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
to keep a reckoning of my Age, who had no Body
left, that ever knew my beginning? I was, <HI>I say,</HI>
above 30 Year old, and had gone thro some Va∣riety
in the World; but as I was perfectly aban∣doned
in my Infancy, and utterly without In∣struction
in my Youth; so I was int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely ig∣norant
of every thing that was worthy the
name of Religion in the World; and this was the
first time that ever any Notion of Religious
Things entered into my Heart; but I was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣priz'd
at this Man's talk, and that several ways;
particularly, he talk'd so feelingly of his pass'd
Circumstances, and they were so like my own,
that every time he made a religious Inference
from his own Condition, and argued from one
Condition of his to another; it struck into my
Thoughts like a Bullet from a Gun, that I had cer∣tainly
as much to be thankful for, and to repent
of, as he had, except only that I had no know∣ledge
of better things to be thankful for, which
he had; but in return for that, I was deliver'd,
and set up in the World, made a Master, and easy,
and was in good Circumstances, being rais'd from
the very same low distress'd Condition as he was
in, I mean a sold Servant; but that he remain'd
so still, so that if his Sin had been greater than
mine, so his Distress'd was still greater.</P>
<P>THIS Article of Gratitude struck deep, and
lay heavy upon my Mind; I remembered that I
was Grateful to the last degree to my old Master,
who had rais'd me from my low Condition, and
that I lov'd the very name of him, or as might
be said, the very Ground he trod on; but I had
not so much as once thought of any higher obli∣gation;
no, nor, so much as like the Pharisee
had said, one <HI>God I thank thee,</HI> to him, for all the
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
influence which his Providence must have had in
my whole Affair.</P>
<P>IT occurr'd to me presently, that if none of
all these things befall us without the direction of
a divine Power, as my new Instructor had told me
at large; and that God had order'd every thing, the
most Minute, and least Transaction of Life, in∣somuch,
<HI>That not a Hair of our Heads shall fall to
the Ground without his Permission;</HI> I say, it occurr'd
to me, that I had been a most unthankful Dog to
that Providence, that had done so much for me;
and the Consequence of the Reflection was im∣mediately
this; how justly may that Power, so
disoblig'd, take away again his Wooll, and his
Flax, with which I am now clothed, and re∣duce
me to the misery of my first Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>THIS perplex'd me much, and I was very pen∣sive,
and sad, in which however, my new Instructor
was a constant Comforter to me, and I learn'd
every day something or other from him, upon
which I told him one Morning, that I thought
he must leave off teaching me Latin, and Teach
me Religion.</P>
<P>HE spoke with a great deal of Modesty of his
being uncapable of Informing me of any thing
that I did not know, and propos'd to me to read
the Scriptures every Day, as the sure and only
Fund of Instruction: I answer'd; that in the
Words of the <HI>Enuch</HI> to St. <HI>Philip,</HI> when the Apo∣stle
ask'd him, if he understood what he read?
<HI>How can I, unless some one Guide me?</HI></P>
<P>WE talk'd frequently upon this Subject, and I
found so much Reason to believe he was a Sincere
Convert, that I can speak of him as no other, in
all I have to say of him: However, I cannot say
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
my Thoughts were yet Ripen'd, for an Oppera∣tion
of that kind; I had some uneasiness about
my past Life, and I liv'd now, and had done so
before I knew him, a very regular Sober Life, al∣ways
taken up in my Business, and running into
no Excesses; but as to commencing Penitent, as
this Man had done, I cannot say, I had any Con∣victions
upon me, sufficient to bring it on, nor
had I a Fund of religious Knowledge to support
me in it; so it wore off again Gradually, as such
things generally do, where the first Impressions
are not deep enough.</P>
<P>IN the mean time as he Read over long Lectures
of his own Disasters to me, and applied them all
seriously to me, so our Discourse was always ve∣ry
Solid and Weighty, and we had nothing of Le∣vity
between us, even when we were not con∣cern'd
in religious Discourses: He read History
to me, and where Books were wanting, he gave
me Ideas of those things which had not been Re∣corded
by our modern Histories, or at least, that
our Number of Books would not reach; by these
things he rais'd an unquenchable Thirst in me,
after seeing something that was doing in the
World, and the more because all the World was
at that time engag'd more or less, in the great
War wherein the <HI>French</HI> King might be said to
be engag'd with, and against all the Powers of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Now, I look'd upon my self as one Buried a∣live,
in a remote Part of the World, where I
could see nothing at all, and hear but a little of
what was seen, and that little, not till at least
half a Year after it was done, and sometimes a
Year or more; and in a Word, the old Reproach
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
often came in my way; Namely, that even this
was not yet, the Life of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>IT was true, that this was much nearer to it,
than that of a Pick-pocket, and still nearer than
that of a sold Slave: But in short, this would not
do, and I cou'd receive no Satisfaction in it; I
had now a second Plantation, a very considerable
one, and it went forward very well; I had on it
almost 100 Servants already, of sundry Sorts,
and an Overseer, that I had a great deal of Rea∣son
to say, I might depend upon, and but that,
I had a third in Embrio, and newly begun, I
had nothing to hinder me from going where I
pleas'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I now began to Frame my
Thoughts for a Voyage to <HI>England;</HI> resolving
then to Act as I should see Cause, but with a se∣cret
Resolution, to see more of the World, if
possible, and reallize those things to my Mind,
which I had hitherto only entertain'd remote
Ideas of, by the helps of Books.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, I push'd forward the Settle∣ment
of my third Plantation, in order to bring
it to be in a Posture, to be either let to a Tennant,
or left in Trust with an Overseer, as I should
find occasion.</P>
<P>HAD I resolved to leave it to an Overseer, or
Steward, no Man in the World could have been
fit for it, like my Tutor; but I could not think of
parting with him, who was the Cause of my de∣sire
of Travelling, and who I concluded to make
my Partner in my Travels.</P>
<P>IT was three Year after this, before I could
get things in order, fit for my leaving the Coun∣try;
in this time I deliver'd my Tutor from his
Bondage, and would have given him his Liberty,
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
but to my great disappointment I found that I could
not empower him to go for <HI>England,</HI> till his time
was expir'd, according to the Certificate of his
Transportation; which was Register'd, so I made
him one of my Overseers, and thereby rais'd him
gradually to a Prospect of living in the same man∣ner,
and by the like steps that my good
Benefactor rais'd me; only, that I did not
assist him to enter upon Planting for himself as
I was assisted, neither was I upon the Spot to do
it; but his Man's Diligence and honest Applica∣tion,
even unassisted deliver'd himself, any far∣ther
than, as <HI>I say,</HI> by making him an Overseer,
which was only a present Ease and Deliverance
to him from the hard Labour, and Fare, which
he endured as a Servant.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in this Trust, he behav'd so faithful∣ly,
and so diligently, that it recommended him in
the Country; and when I came back, I found him
in Circumstances very differing from what I left
him in, besides his being my principal Mannager
for near twenty Years, as you shall hear in its
Place.</P>
<P>I mention these things the more at large, that if
any unhappy Wretch, who may have the Disaster
to fall into such Circumstances as these, may come
to see this Account, they may learn the follow∣ing
short Lessons from these Examples.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT <HI>Virginia,</HI> and a State of Transportati∣on,
may be the happiest Place and Condition
they were ever in, for this Life, as by a
sincere Repentance, and a diligent Applica∣tion
to the Business they are put to; they
are effectually deliver'd from a Life of a
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
flagrant Wickedness, and put in a perfectly
new Condition, in which they have no
Temptation to the Crimes they formerly
committed, and have a prospect of Advan∣tage
for the future.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the meanest, and most
despicable Creature after his time of Ser∣vitude
is expir'd, if he will but apply him∣self
with Diligence and Industry to the Bu∣siness
of the Country, is sure (Life and Health
suppos'd) both of living Well and growing
Rich.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>AS this is a foundation, which the most un∣fortunate
Wretch alive is entitul'd to; a Trans∣ported
Felon, is in my Opinion a much happier
Man, than the most prosperous untaken Thief in
the Nation; nor are those poor young People so
much in the wrong, as some imagine them to be,
that go voluntarily over to those Countries, and
in order to get themselves carried over, and
plac'd there, freely bind themselves, there; espe∣cially
if the Persons into whose Hands they fall,
do any thing honestly by them; for as it is to
be suppos'd that those poor People knew not
what Course to take before, or had miscarried in
their Conduct before; here they are sure to be
immediately provided for, and after the expira∣tion
of their time, to be put into a Condition to
provide for themselves; but I return to my own
Story, which now begins a new Scene.</P>
<P>I WAS now making Provision for my going
to <HI>England,</HI> after having settled my Planta∣tion
in such Hands, as was fully to my satisfacti∣on;
my first Work was to furnish myself with
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
such a Stock of Goods, and Money, as might be
sufficient for my occasions Abroad, and particu∣larly
might allow to make large Returns to <HI>Mary∣land,</HI>
for the Use and Supply of all my Planta∣tions;
but when I came to look nearer into the
Voyage, it occurr'd to me, that it would not be
prudent to put my Cargo all on Aboard the same
Ship that I went in; so I Shipp'd at several
times five Hundred Hogsheads of Tobbacco in
several Ships for <HI>England,</HI> giving Notice to my
Correspondent in <HI>London,</HI> that I would Embark
about such a time to come over myself, and or∣dering
him to Ensure for a considerable Sum, pro∣portion'd
to the value of my Cargo.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Months after this I left the Place,
and Embark'd for <HI>England,</HI> in a stout Ship, carry∣ing
24 Guns, and about six Hundred Hogsheds of
Tobacco, and we left the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> on the
first of <HI>August</HI>—: We had a very sour and rough
Voyage for the first Fortnight, tho' it was in a
Season so generally noted for good Weather.</P>
<P>AFTER we had been about eleven Days at Sea,
having the Wind most part of the Time blowing
very hard at West or between the West and
N. W. by which we were carried a great way far∣ther
to the Eastward, than they usually go in
their Course for <HI>England,</HI> we met with a furious
Tempest, which held us five Days, blowing most
of the time excessive hard, and by which, we were
oblig'd to run away a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the Wind, <HI>as the Sea∣men
call it,</HI> wheresoever it was, our Lot to go;
by this Storm, our Ship was greatly damag'd, and
some Leaks we had, but not so bad, but that by
the diligence of the Seamen they were stopp'd:
However, the Captain after having beaten up
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
again, as well as he could against the Weather
and the Sea going very high, at length he resol∣ved
to go away for the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS not Seaman enough to understand what
the Reason of their Disputes was, but in their
running for the Islands, it seems they over-shot the
Latitude, and could never reach the Island of
<HI>Bermudas</HI> again; the Master and the Mate differ∣ed
to an extremity about this; their reckonings,
being more than usually wide of one another, the
Storm having driven them a little out of their
Knowledge; the Master being a positive Man, in∣sulted
the Mate about it, and threatn'd to ex∣pose
him for it, when he came to <HI>England:</HI> The
Mate was an excellent Sea Artist, and an expe∣rienc'd
Sailor, but withal a modest Man; and
tho' he insisted upon his being right, did it
in respectful Terms, and as it became him; but
after several days Dispute, when the Weather
came to abate, and the Heavens to clear up that
they could take their Observations, and know
where they were, it appear'd that the Mates ac∣count
was right, and the Captain was mistaken,
for they were then in the Latitude of 29 Degrees,
and quite out of the Wake of the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>THE Mate made no Indecent use of the Dis∣covery
at all, and the Captain being convinc'd,
carry'd it civilly to him, and so the Heats were
over among them; but the next Question was,
What they should do next? some were for go∣ing
one Way, some another, but all agreed they
were not in Condition to go on the direct Course
for <HI>England,</HI> unless they could have a Southerly,
or South-west Wind, which had not been our
Fate since we came to Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231"/>
UPON the whole, they resolv'd by consent to
stand away for the <HI>Canaries,</HI> which was the near∣est
Land they could make, except the <HI>Cape de
Verd</HI> Islands, which were too much to the South∣ward
for us, if it could be avoided.</P>
<P>UPON this, they stood away N. E. and the Wind
hanging still Westerly, or to the Northward of the
West, we made good Way, and in about 15 Days
sail we made the <HI>Pico Teneriffe</HI> being a monstrous
Hill in one of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands: Here we
refresh'd our selves, got fresh Water, and some
fresh Provisions, and plenty of excellent Wine,
but no Harbour to run into, to take care of the
Ship, which was Leaky, and tender, having had
so much very bad Weather; so we were oblig'd to
do as well as we could, and put to Sea again, af∣ter
Riding at the <HI>Canaries</HI> four Days only.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Canaries,</HI> we had tollerable Weather,
and a smooth Sea, till we came into the Sound∣ings,
so they call the Mouth of the <HI>British</HI> Chan∣nel,
and the Wind blowing hard at the N. and
N. W. oblig'd us to keep a larger Offing, as the
Seamen call it, at our Enterance into the Chan∣nel,
when behold! in the gray of the Morning, a
<HI>French</HI> Cruiser, or Privateer of 26 Guns appear'd,
and crowded after us with all the Sail they could
make: In short, our Captain exchang'd a Broad∣side
or two with them, which was terrible Work
to me; for I had never seen such before, the
<HI>Frenchman's</HI> Guns having Raked us, and kill'd and
wounded six of our best Men.</P>
<P>IN short, after a Fight long enough to show us,
that if we would not be taken, we must resolve to
sink by her Side, for there was no room to ex∣pect
Deliverance; and a Fight long enough to
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
save the Master's Credit, we were taken, and
the Ship carried away for St. <HI>Malo's.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS not mnch concern'd for the loss I had
in the Ship, because I knew I had sufficient in the
World somewhere or other; but as I was effectu∣ally
strip'd of every thing I had about me, and
even almost my Cloaths from my back, I was in
but a very indifferent Condition; but some Body
informing the Captain of the Privateer, that I
was a Passenger, and a Merchant, he call'd for
me, and inquir'd into my Circumstances, and
coming to hear from myself, how I had been us'd,
oblig'd the Seamen to give me a Coat and Hat,
and a pair of Shoes, which they had taken off me,
and himself gave me a Morning Gown of his
own, to wear while I was in his Ship, and to give
him his due treated me very well.</P>
<P>I HAD however, besides my being taken, the
Mortification to be detain'd on Board the Crui∣ser,
and seeing the Ship I was in Mann'd with
<HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and sent away, as above, for St. <HI>Ma∣lo,</HI>
and this was a greater Mortification to me af∣terwards,
when being brought into St. <HI>Malos,</HI> I
heard that our own Ship was Retaken in her
Passage to St <HI>Malo's</HI> by an <HI>Englishman</HI> of War, and
carryed to <HI>Portsmouth.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our Ship was sent away, the <HI>Rover</HI>
Cruis'd abroad again in the Mouth of the Channel
for some time; but met with no Purchase, at last
they made a Sail, which prov'd to be one of their
Nation, and one of their own Trade, from whom
they learn'd (the News having been carried to
<HI>England,</HI> that some <HI>French</HI> Privateers lay off and
on, in the Soundings,) that three <HI>Englishmen</HI> of War
were come out from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> on purpose to Cruise
in the Channel, and that they would certainly meet
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
with us. Upon this Intelligence, the <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
a bold brave Fellow, far from shrinking from
his Work, stands away North East for St. <HI>Georges</HI>
Channel, and in the Latitude of 48 and a half, un∣happily
enough, meets with a large and rich <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Ship, bound home from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> it was in
the gray of the Morning, and very clear when a
Man on the Round-Top, cry'd out <HI>an voile,</HI> a Sail:
I was in hopes indeed it had been the <HI>Eng∣lishmen</HI>
of War, and by the Hurry and Clutter
they were in, to get all ready for a Fight, I con∣cluded
it was so, and got out of my Hammock, for
I had no Cabbin to lye in, that I might see what
it was, but I soon found that my hopes were
vain, and it was on the wrong Side; for that
being on our Larboard Bow, the Ship lying
then Northward, to make the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
by the time I was turn'd out I could per∣ceive
they had all their Sails bent, and full, ha∣ving
begun to Chace, and making great way; on
the other Hand, it was Evident the Ship saw
them too, and knew what they were, and to a∣void
them, stretch'd away with all the Canvas they
could lay on, for the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to run
in there for Harbour.</P>
<P>OUR Privateer, it was plain, infinitely out sail'd
her, running two Foot for her one, and towards
Evening came up with them; had they been able
to have held it but six Hours longer, they would
have got into <HI>Limerick</HI> River, or somewhere un∣der
Shore; so that we should not have ven∣tured
upon them, but we came up with them,
and the Captain when he see there was no Reme∣dy,
bravely brought too, and prepar'd to Fight,
she was a Ship of 30 Guns, but deep in the
Sea, cumber'd between Deck with Goods, and
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
could not run out her lower Deck Guns, the Sea
also going pretty high, tho' at last ventur'd
to open her Gun-room Ports, and Fire with
three Guns on a Side; but her worst fate was,
she sail'd heavy, being deep Loaden, and the
<HI>Frenchman</HI> had run up by her Side, and pour'd in
his Broad-side, and was soon ready again; How∣ever,
as she was well Mann'd too, and that the
<HI>English</HI> Sailors bestirr'd themselves, they gave us
their Broad-sides too very nimbly and heartily,
and I found the <HI>Frenchman</HI> had a great many Men
kill'd at the first Brush, but the next was worse,
for the <HI>English</HI> Ship, tho' she did not sail so
well as the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> was a bigger Ship, and
strong built, and as we (the <HI>French</HI>) bore down
upon them again, the <HI>English</HI> run boldly on Board
us, and lay'd Thwart our Hause, lashing them∣selves
fast to us; then it was that the <HI>English</HI>
Captain run out his lower Tire of Guns, and in∣deed
tore the <HI>Frenchman</HI> so, that had he held it,
the Privateer would have had the worst of it;
but the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> with admirable readiness in∣deed,
and Courage, the Captain appearing every
where, with his Sword in his Hand, bestirr'd them∣selves,
and loosing themselves from the <HI>English</HI>
Ship, thrusting her off with Brooms, and pour∣ing
their small Shot so thick, that the other
could not appear upon Deck; <HI>I say,</HI> clearing
themselves thus, they came to lye a Broadside of
each other, when by long firing the <HI>English</HI> Ship
was at length disabled, her Missen-Mast and Bole∣sprit
shot away, and which was worst of all, her
Captain kill'd, so that after a Fight which held
all Night, for they fought in the Dark, and part
of the next Day, they were oblig'd to Strike.</P>
<P>I was civily desir'd by the <HI>French</HI> Captain to
go down into the Hold, while the Fight held,
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
and besides the Civility of it, I found he was
not willing I should be upon Deck; perhaps he
thought I might have some Opportunity to do hurt,
tho' I know not how it could be: However, I was
very ready to go down, for I had no Mind to be
Kill'd; especially by my own Friends, so I went
down and sat by the Surgeon, and had the Oppor∣tunity
to find, that the first Broad-side the <HI>English</HI>
Fir'd, seven wounded Men were brought down to
the Surgeon, and three and Thirty more after∣ward;
<HI>that is to say,</HI> when the <HI>English</HI> lay Thwart
their Bow, and after they Cleared themselves,
there was about Eleven more; so that they had
one and fifty Men Wounded, and about two and
Twenty Kill'd, the <HI>Englishman</HI> had eighteen Men
Kill'd and Wounded, among whom, was the Captain.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Captain however, triumph'd in
this Prize, for it was an exceeding Rich Ship, ha∣ving
Abundance of Silver on Board; and after
the Ship was taken, and they had Plundered all
the great Cabbin afforded, which was very Consi∣derable;
the Mate promis'd the Captain; that if
he would give him his Liberty, he would discover
Six Thousand peices of Eight to him Privately,
which none of the Men should know of; the Cap∣tain
engag'd, and gave it under his Hand to set
him at Liberty, as soon as he came on Shore; ac∣cordingly
in the Night after all was either turn'd
in, <HI>as they call it,</HI> or Employ'd on the Duty of
the Watch, the Captain, and the Mate of the
Prize went on Board, and having faithfully Dis∣cover'd
the Money which lay in a Place made on
purpose to Conceal it; the Captain resolv'd to
let it lye till they arriv'd, and then he Convey'd
it on Shore for his own use; so that the Owners
nor the Seamen ever came to any Share of it,
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
which by the way was a Fraud in the Captain,
but the Mate paid his Ransom by the Discovery,
and the Captain gave him his Liberty very Pun∣ctually
as he promis'd, and two Hundred peices
of Eight to carry him into <HI>England,</HI> and to make
good his Losses.</P>
<P>WHEN he had made this Prize, the Captain
thought of nothing more, than how to get safe to
<HI>France</HI> with her; for she was a Ship sufficient to
Enrich all his Men, and his Owners also. The
Account of her Cargo by the Captains Books, of
which I took a Copy, was in general:
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>260 Hhds Sugar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>187 Smaller Cask of Sugar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>176 Barrels of <HI>Indico.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>28 Cask of <HI>Piemento.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>42 Baggs of Cotton-Woll.</ITEM>
<ITEM>80 C. Weight of <HI>Elephants</HI> Teeth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 Small Cask of Rum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18000 Peices of Eight, besides the 6000
Conceal'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Several parcels of Drugs, Tortoise-shell,
Sweet-meats call'd Succads, Choco∣late.
Lime-juice, and other things of
considerable Value.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>THIS was a Terrible loss among the <HI>English</HI>
Merchants, and a noble Booty for the Rogues that
took it; but as it was in open War, and by fair
Fighting as they call it, there was no Objection
to be made against them, and to give them their
Due, they Fought bravely for it.</P>
<P>THE Captain was not so bold as to meeting
the <HI>English</HI>-Men of War before, but he was as
wary now; for having a Prize of such Value in
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
his Hands, he was resolv'd not to lose her again,
if he could help it; so he stood away to the South∣ward,
and that so far, that I once thought he was
resolv'd to go into the Streights, and Home by <HI>Mar∣seilles.</HI>
But having sail'd to the Latitude of 45.
3 qrs. or thereabouts, he stood away East, into
the Bottom of the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> and carried us
all into the River of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where on Notice
of his Arrival with such a Prize, his Owners or
Principals came Overland to see him, and where
they consulted what to do with her; the Money
they secur'd to be sure, and some of the Cargo;
but the Ships sail'd afterwards along the Coast to
St. <HI>Malo,</HI> taking the Opportunity of some <HI>French</HI>
Men of War which were Cruising on the Coast,
to be their Convoy as far as <HI>Ushant.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the Captain rewarded and dismiss'd the
<HI>English</HI> Mate, <HI>as I have said,</HI> who got a Passage
from thence to <HI>Diep</HI> by Sea, and after that into
<HI>England,</HI> by the help of a Passport, thro' <HI>Flanders,</HI>
to <HI>Ostend;</HI> the Captain it seems, the more willing∣ly
Ship'd him off, that he might not Discover to
others, what he had Discover'd to him.</P>
<P>I was now at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and the Cap∣tain
ask'd me one Morning, what I intended to
do, I did not understand him at first, but he soon
gave me to understand, that I was now either to
be deliver'd up to the State as an <HI>English</HI> Prisoner,
and so be carried to <HI>Dinant</HI> in <HI>Britanny,</HI> or to find
means to have my self Exchang'd, or to pay my
Ransom; and this Ransom he told me at first, was
300 Crowns.</P>
<P>I knew not what to do, but desir'd he would
give me time to Write to <HI>England,</HI> to my Friends;
for that I had a Cargo of Goods sent to them, by
me, from <HI>Virginia,</HI> but I did not know but it
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
might have fallen into such Hands as his were,
and if it was, I knew not what would be my Fate;
he readily granted that, so I Wrote by the Post,
and had the Satisfaction in Answer to it, to hear
that the Ship I was taken in, had been retaken,
and carried into <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> which I doubted
would have made my new Master more strict, and
perhaps insolent, but he said nothing of it to me,
nor I to him, tho' as I afterwards understand, he
had Advice of it before.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this was a help to me, and serv'd
to more than Pay my Ransom to the Captain;
and my Correspondent in <HI>London</HI> hearing of my
being alive, and at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> immediately sent
me a Letter of Credit upon an <HI>English</HI> Merchant
at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> for what ever I might have Occa∣sion
for: As soon as I received this, I went to the
Merchant, who Honour'd the Letter of Credit,
and told me, I should have what Money I pleas'd.
But as I, who was before a meer Stranger in the
Place, and knew not what Course to take, had
now as it were a Friend to Communicate my Af∣fairs
to, and Consult with; as soon as I told him
my Case, Hold, <HI>says he,</HI> if that be your Case, I
may perhaps find a way to get you off without a
Ransom.</P>
<P>THERE was it seems, a Ship Bound Home to
<HI>France</HI> from <HI>Martinico,</HI> taken off of Cape <HI>Finisterre</HI>
by an <HI>Englishman</HI> of War, and a Merchant of <HI>Ro∣chelle</HI>
being a <HI>Passenger,</HI> was taken on Board, and
brought into <HI>Plymouth:</HI> This Man had made great
Sollicitation by his Friends to be Exchang'd,
pleading Poverty, and that he was unable to Pay
any Ransom; my Friend told me something of it,
but not much, only bad me not be too forward
to Pay any Money to the Captain, but pretend
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
I cou'd not hear from <HI>England:</HI> This I did, till the
Captain appear'd Impatient.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, the Captain told me I had
us'd him ill; that I had made him expect a Ran∣som,
and he had treated me Courteously, and been
at Expence to Subsist me, and that I held him in
Suspence, but that in short, if I did not procure
the Money, he would send me to <HI>Dinant,</HI> in Ten
Days, to lye there as the King's Prisoner, till I
should be Exchang'd: My Merchant gave me my
Cue, and by his Direction I answer'd, I was very
sensible of his Civility, and sorry he should lose
what Expences he had been at; but that I found
my Friends forgot me, and what to do I did not
know, and that rather than Impose upon him, I
must Submit to go to <HI>Dinant,</HI> or where he thought
fit to send me; but that if ever I obtain'd my Li∣berty,
and came into <HI>England,</HI> I would not fail
to Reimburse him what Expence he had been at
for my Subsistance; and so in short, made my
Case very bad in all my Discourse: He shook his
Head, and said little, but the next Day Enter'd
me in the List of <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, to be at the
King's Charge, as appointed by the Intendant of
the Place, and to be sent away into <HI>Britainny.</HI></P>
<P>I was then out of the Captains Power, and im∣mediately
the Merchant with two others, who
were Friends to the Merchant Prisoner, at <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI>
went to the Intendant, and Gain'd an Or∣der
for the Exchange, and my Friend giving Se∣curity
for my being Forth-coming, in Case the
other was not Deliver'd; I had my Liberty im∣mediately,
and went Home with him to his
House.</P>
<P>THUS we Bilk'd the Captain of his Ransom
Money: But however, my Friend went to him,
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
and letting him know that I was Exchang'd by
the Governors Order, paid him whatever he cou'd
say he was in Disburse on my Account; and it
was not then in the Captains Power to Object,
or to claim any thing for a Ransom.</P>
<P>I got Passage from hence to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on Board
a <HI>French</HI> Vessel, and having a Certificate of an
Exchang'd Prisoner from the Intendant of <HI>Bourde∣aux:</HI>
I had a Passport given me, to go into the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Netherlands, and so whether I pleas'd.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I came to <HI>Ghent,</HI> in <HI>April</HI>—,
just as the Armies were going to take the
Field; I had no dislike to the Business of the
Army, but I thought I was a little above it now;
and had other things to look to, for that in my
Opinion, no Body went into the Field but those
that cou'd not live at Home; and yet I resolv'd
to see the manner of it a little too, so having made
an Acquaintance with an <HI>English</HI> Officer, Quar∣ter'd
at <HI>Ghent,</HI> I told him my Intention, and he
Invited me to go with him, and offer'd me his
Protection as a Voluntier, that I should Quarter
with him in his Tent, and live as I would, and
either carry Arms, or not, as I saw Occasion.</P>
<P>THE Campaign was none of the hardest that
had been, or were like to be; so that I had the
Diversion of seeing the Service, as it was proper
to call it without much Hazard, indeed, I did
not see any considerable Action, for there was
not much Fighting that Campaign; as to the
Merit of the Cause on either side, I knew nothing
of it, nor had I suffer'd any of the Disputes about
it, to enter into my Thoughts: The Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> had been made King of <HI>England,</HI> and the
<HI>English</HI> Trcops were all on his Side, and I heard
a great deal of Swearing and Damming for King
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
<HI>William</HI> among the Soldiers, but as for Fighting,
I observ'd the <HI>French</HI> Beat them several times,
and particular the Regiment my Friend belo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g'd
to, was surrounded in a Village where they were
Posted; I know not upon what Occasion, and all
taken Prisoners: But by great good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap, I being
not in Service, and so not in Command, was
stroll'd away that Day to see the Country about,
for it was my Delight, to see the strong Towns,
and observe the Beauty of their Fortifications;
and while I Diverted my self thus, I had the
happy Deliverance of not being taken by the
<HI>French</HI> for that time.</P>
<P>WHEN I came back, I found the Enemy pos∣sess'd
of the Town, but as I was no Soldier, they
did me no harm, and having my <HI>French</HI> Passport
in my Pocket, they gave me leave to go to <HI>New∣port,</HI>
were I took the Packet-Boat, and came over
to <HI>England,</HI> Landing at <HI>Deal</HI> instead of <HI>Dover;</HI>
the Weather forcing us into the <HI>Downs,</HI> and thus
my short Campaign ended, and this was my se∣cond
Essay at the Trade of Soldiering.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to <HI>London,</HI> I was very well re∣ceiv'd
by my Friend, to whom I had consign'd my
Effects, and I found my self in very good Circum∣stances;
for all my Goods, which as above, by
several Ships I had Consign'd to him, came safe
to Hand; and my Overseers that I had left be∣hind,
had Ship'd at several times 400 Hhds of
<HI>Tobacco</HI> to my Correspondent in my Absence,
being the Product of my Plantations, or Part of
it, for the time of my being Abroad; so that I
had above a Thousand Pounds in my Factors
Hands, 200 Hhds of <HI>Tobacco</HI> besides left in Hand,
not Sold.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="242"/>
I HAD nothing to do now, but entirely to conceal
myself, from all that had any knowledge of me
before, and this was the easiest thing in the World
to do; for I was grown out of every Body's
knowledge, and most of those I had known were
grown out of mine: My Captain, who went with
me, or rather, who carryed me away; I found by
enquiring at the proper Place, had been ramb∣ling
about the World, came to <HI>London,</HI> fell into
his old Trade, which he could not forbear, and
growing an eminent Highway-man, had made his
Exit at the Gallows; after a Life of 14 Years most
exquisite and successful Rogueries; the particulars
of which would make as I observ'd an admira∣ble
History; my other Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> who I cal∣led
Major follow'd the like wicked Trade; but
was a Man of more Gallantry, and Generosity,
and having committed innumerable Depredations
upon Mankind, yet had always so much Dexte∣rity,
as to bring himself off, till at length he
was laid fast in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and loaded with Irons,
and would certainly have gone the same way as
the Captain; but he was so dexterous a Rogue,
that no Goal, no Fetters would hold him; and he
with two more, found means to knock off their
Irons, work'd their way thro' the Wall of the Pri∣son,
and let themselves down on the Out-side in
the Night; so escaping, they found means to get
into <HI>France,</HI> where he followed the same Trade,
and that with so much Success, that he grew fa∣mous
by the Name of <HI>Anthony,</HI> and had the Hon∣our
with three of his Comrades, who he had
Taught the <HI>English</HI> way of Robbing generously,
<HI>as they called it,</HI> without Murthering or Wound∣ing,
or Ill using those they robb'd, <HI>I say,</HI> he had
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
the Honour to be broke upon the Wheel at the
<HI>Greve</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>ALL these things I found Means to be fully in∣form'd
of, and to have a long Account of the
particulars of their Conduct, from some of their
Comrades, who had the good Fortune to Escape,
and who I got the Knowledge of, without letting
them so much as guess at who I was, or upon what
Account I enquir'd.</P>
<P>I WAS now at the height of my good Fortune;
indeed I was in very good Circumstances, and be∣ing
of a frugal Temper from the beginning, I
Sav'd things together, as they came, and yet liv'd
very well too; particularly I had the Repu∣tation
of a very considerable Merchant, and one
that came over vastly Rich from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and as
I frequently brought Supplies for my several
Families and Plantations there, as they wrote
to me for them, so I pass'd, <HI>I say,</HI> for a great
Merchant.</P>
<P>I liv'd single indeed, and in Lodgings, but I
began to be very well known, and tho' I had sub∣scrib'd
my Name only <HI>Jack</HI> to my particular
Correspondent, yet the <HI>French,</HI> among whom I
liv'd near a Year, <HI>as I have said;</HI> not understand∣ing
what <HI>Jack</HI> meant, call'd me Monsieur <HI>Jacque,</HI>
and Colonel <HI>Jacques,</HI> and so gradually Colonel
<HI>Jacque;</HI> so I was call'd in the Certificate of Ex∣changing
me with the other Prisoner, so that I went
so also in <HI>Flanders;</HI> upon which, and seeing my
Certificate of Exchange, <HI>as above,</HI> I was call'd
Colonel <HI>Jaques</HI> in <HI>Enland,</HI> by my Friend, who
I call'd Correspondent; and thus I pass'd for a
Foreigner, and a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and I was infinite∣ly
fond of having every Body take me for a
<HI>Frenchman;</HI> and as I spoke <HI>French</HI> very well, ha∣ving
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
learn'd it by continuing so long among
them; so I went constantly to the <HI>French-Church</HI>
in <HI>London,</HI> and spoke <HI>French</HI> upon all occasions,
as much as I could, and to compleat the ap∣pearance
of it, I got me a <HI>French</HI> Servant to
do my Business, I mean as to my Merchandise,
which only consisted in receiving and disposing
of Tobacco, of which I had about 500 to 600
Hogsheads a Year from my own Plantations,
and in supplying my People with Necessaries, as
they wanted them.</P>
<P>IN this private Condition I continued about
two Year more, when the Devil owing me a
Spleen, ever since I refus'd being a Thief, paid
me home, with my Interest, by laying a Snare
in my way, which had almost ruined me.</P>
<P>THERE dwelt a Lady, in a House opposite to
the House I lodg'd in, who made an extraordi∣nary
Figure, indeed she went very well Dress'd,
and was a most beautiful Person; she was well
Bred, Sung admirably fine, and sometimes I could
hear her very distinctly, the Houses being over
against one another, in a narrow Court not much
unlike <HI>Three King Court</HI> in <HI>Lombard Street.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Lady put herself so often in my way, that
I could not in good Manners forbear taking
Notice of her, and giving her the Ceremony of
my Hat, when I saw her at her Window, or at the
Door, or when I pass'd her in the Court, so that we
became almost acquainted at a distance; sometimes
she also visited at the House I lodg'd at, and it
was generally contriv'd, that I should be intro∣duced
when she came; and thus by degrees we
became more intimately acquainted, and often
convers'd together in the Family, but always in
Publick, at least for a great while.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="245"/>
I WAS a meer Boy in the Affair of Love, and
knew the least of what belong'd to a Woman, of any
Man in <HI>Europe</HI> of my Age; the thoughts of a Wife,
much less of a Mistress, had never so much as taken
the least hold of my Head, and I had been till
now as perfectly unacquainted with the Sex, and
as unconcern'd about them, as I was when I was
ten Year old, and lay in a Heap of Ashes at the
<HI>Glass-House.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I know not by what Witch-Craft in the
Conversation of this Woman, and her singling
me out upon several Occasions, I began to be en∣snared,
I knew not how, or to what to End; and was
on a sudden so embarrass'd in my Thoughts about
her, that like a Charm she had me always in her
Circle; if she had not been one of the subtilest,
Women on Earth, she could never have brought
me to have given myself the least Trouble about
her, but I drawn in by the Magick of a Genius
capable to Deceive a more wary Capacity than
mine, and it was impossible to resist her.</P>
<P>SHE attack'd me without ceasing, with the fine∣ness
of her Conduct, and with Arts which were
impossible to be ineffectual; she was ever, as it
were, in my View; often in my Company, and
yet kept herself so on the Reserve, so surrounded
continually with Obstructions, that for several
Months after she could perceive I sought an Op∣portunity
to speak to her, she rendered it impos∣sible,
nor could I ever break in upon her, she
kept her Guard so well.</P>
<P>THIS rigid Behaviour was the greatest Myste∣ry
that could be, considering at the same time,
that she never Declined my seeing her, or Con∣versing
with me in Publick; but she held it on,
she took care never to sit next me, that I might
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
slip no Paper into her Hand, or speak softly to
her; she kept some body or other always between,
that I could never come up to her; and thus
as if she was resolv'd really to have nothing to
do with me, she held me at the Bay several
Months.</P>
<P>ALL this while nothing was more certain then
that she intended to have me, if she could catch,
and it was indeed a kind of a Catch, for she man∣ag'd
all by Art, and drew me in with the most
resolute backwardness, that it was almost im∣possible
not to be deceiv'd by it; on the other
Hand, she did not appear to be a Woman despica∣ble,
neither was she poor, or in a Condition that
should require so much Art to draw any Man
in, but the Cheat was really on my Side; for
she was unhappily told, that I was vastly Rich,
a great Merchant, and that she would live like
a Queen, which I was not at all Instrumental in
putting upon her, neither did I know that she
went upon that Motive.</P>
<P>SHE was too cunning to let me perceive how
easie she was to be had; on the contrary she run
all the hazards of bringing me to neglect her en∣tirely,
that one would think any Woman in the
World could do; and I have wondered often since
that, how it was possible it should fail of making
me perfectly Averse to her; for as I had a per∣fect
indifferency for the whole Sex, and never
till then entertain'd any Notion of them, they
were no more to me than a Picture hanging up
against a Wall.</P>
<P>As we Convers'd freely together in Publick,
so she took a great many Occasions to rally the
Men, and the weakness they were guilty of, in
leting the Woman insult them as they did; she
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
thought if the Men had been Fools, Marriage
had been only Treaties of Peace between two
Neighbours, or Alliances Offensive or Defen∣sive,
which must necessarily have been carried
on sometimes by Interviews, and personal
Treaties; but oftner by Ambassadors, Agents,
and Emissaries on both Sides; but that the Wo∣men
had out-witted us, and brought us upon our
Knees, and made us whine after them, and lower
our selves, so as we could never pretend to gain
our equallity again.</P>
<P>I TOLD her I thought it was a Decency to the
Ladies to give them the Advantage of denying a
little, that they might be Courted, and that I should
not like a Woman the worse for denying me.
I expect it Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> when I wait on you
to Morrow, intimating, that I intended it; you
shan't be deceiv'd Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> for I'll deny
now, before you ask me the Question.</P>
<P>I WAS dash'd so effectually, with so malici∣ous,
so devilish an Answer, that I return'd with
a little sullenness, I shan't Trespass upon you
yet Madam, and I shall be very careful not to
offend you when I do.</P>
<P>IT is the greatest Token of your Respect
Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> that you are able to bestow upon
me, and the most agreeable too, except one, which
I will not be out of hopes of obtaining of you
in a little time.</P>
<P>WHAT is in my Power to oblige you in
Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> you may command me at any
time, especially, the way we are Talking of;
this I spoke still with a Resentment very Sincere.</P>
<P>'TIS only, Sir, that you would promise to
Hate me, with as much Sincerity, as I will endea∣vour
to make you a suitable Return.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248"/>
I granted that Request, Madam, seven Year
before you ask'd it, <HI>said I,</HI> for I heartily Hated
the whole Sex, and scarce know how I came to
abate that good Disposition in Compliment to
your Conversation; but I assure you that abate∣ment
is so little, that it does no Injury to your
Proposal.</P>
<P>THERE's some Mystery in that indeed, Sir,
<HI>said she,</HI> for I desir'd to assist your Aversion to
Women in a more particular manner, and hop'd it
should never abate under my Management. We
said a Thousand ill-natured things after this, but
she out-did me, for she had such a Stock of bitter∣ness
upon her Tongue, as no Woman ever went be∣yond
her, and yet all this while she was the plea∣santest,
and most obliging Creature in every Part
of our Conversation that could possibly be, and
meant not one Word of what she said, no, not a
Word: But I must confess, it no way answer'd her
End, for it really cooled all my Thoughts of her,
and I that had liv'd in so perfect an indifferency
to the Sex all my Days, was easily return'd to
that Condition again, and began to grow very
cold and negligent in my usual Respects to her up∣on
all Occasions.</P>
<P>SHE soon found she had gone too far with me;
and in short, that she was extreamly out in her
Politicks, that she had to do with one that was
not listed yet among the whining Sort of Lovers,
and knew not what it was to Adore a Mis∣tress,
in order to abuse her; and that it was
not with me, as it was with the usual Sort of
Men in Love, that are warm'd by the cold, and
rise in their Passions, as the Ladies fall in their
Returns; on the contrary, she found that it was
quite alter'd; I was Civil to her, as before, but not
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
so forward, when I saw her at her Chamber Win∣dow,
I did not throw mine open, as I usually, had
done to Talk with her; when she Sung in the Par∣lour,
where I could easily, hear it, I did not Listen;
when she Visited at the House where I Lodg'd, I
did not always come down, or if I did. I had busi∣ness
which oblig'd me to go Abroad, and yet
all this while, when I did come into her Com∣pany,
I was as intimate as ever.</P>
<P>I could easily see that this madded her to the
Heart, and that she was perplex'd to the last
degree, for she found that she had all her Game
to play over again; that so absolute a Reserved∣ness,
even to Rudeness and Ill-manners, was a
little too much; but she was a meer Posture
Mistress in Love, and could put herself into
what Shapes she pleas'd.</P>
<P>SHE was to wise to show a fondness or forward∣ness,
that look'd like kindness, she knew that was
the meanest, and the last Step a Woman can
take, and lays her under the Foot of the Man
she pretends to; Fondness is not the last Favour
indeed, but it is the last Favour but one, that a Wo∣man
can grant, and lays her almost as low, I mean
it lays her at the Mercy of the Man, she shows it to,
but she was not come to that neither: This Ca∣melion
put on another Colour, turn'd on a sud∣den
the gravest, soberest, majestick Madam, so that
any one would have thought she was advanced in
Age in one Week, from Two and Twenty, to
Fifty, and this she carried on with so much Go∣vernment
of her self, that it did not in the least
look like Art, but if it was a Representation
of Nature only, it was so like Nature itself, that
no body living can be able to distinguish; she
Sung very often in her Parlour, as well by her
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
self as with two young Ladies, who came often
to see her; I could see by their Books, and her
Guitar in her Hand, that she was Singing, but
she never open'd the Window as she was wont
to do; upon my coming to my Window, she
kept her own always shut, or if it was open,
she would be sitting at Work and not look up,
it may be once in Half an Hour.</P>
<P>IF she saw me by Accident all this while, she
would smile and speak as chearfully as ever,
but it was but a Word or two, and so make her Ho∣nours
and be gone; so that in a Word, we Convers'd
just as we did; after I had been there a Week.</P>
<P>SHE tired me quite out at this Work, for tho'
I began the strangness indeed, yet I did not de∣sign
the carrying it on so far, but she held it to
the last, just in the same manner as she began
it: She came to the House where I Lodg'd, as
usual, and we were often together, Supp'd toge∣ther,
Play'd at Cards together, Danc'd together;
for in <HI>France</HI> I accomplish'd myself with every
thing that was needful, to make me what I be∣liev'd
myself to be even from a Boy, I mean a
Gentleman; <HI>I say,</HI> we Convers'd together, <HI>as a∣bove,</HI>
but she was so perfectly another thing
than what she us'd to be in every Part of her
Conversation, that it presently occurr'd to me,
that her former Behaviour was a kind of a Rant,
or Fit; that either it was the Effect of some
extraordinary Levity that had come upon her,
or that it was done to Mimick the Coquets of the
Town, believing it might take with me, who she
thought was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that it was what I
lov'd; but her new Gravity was her real natural
Temper, and indeed became it her so much
better, or as I should say, she acted it so well,
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
that it really brought me back, to have, not as
much only, but more mind to her, than ever I
had before.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it was a great while before I disco∣ver'd
myself, and I stay'd indeed to find out, if
possible, whether this Change was Real or Coun∣terfeit?
for I could not easily believe it was pos∣sible
the Gay Humour she us'd to appear in could
be a Counterfeit; it was not therefore till a Year
and almost a Quarter, that I came to any Reso∣lution
in my Thoughts about her, when on a
meer Accident we came to a little Conversation
together.</P>
<P>SHE came to Visit at our House as usual, and
it happen'd all the Ladies were gone abroad; but
as it fell out, I was in the Passage, or Entry of
the House, going towards the Stairs, when she
knock'd at the Door; so stepping back, I open'd
the Door, and she without any Ceremony came
in and run forward into the Parlour, supposing
the Women had been there, I went in after her,
as I could do no less, because she did know that
the Family was Abroad.</P>
<P>UPON my coming in, she ask'd for the Ladies,
I told her, I hop'd she came to Visit me now, for
that the Ladies were all gone abroad; are they, <HI>said
she,</HI> as if surpris'd (tho' as I understood afterwards
she knew it before, as also that I was at home) and
then rises up to be gone; no Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> Pray
do not go; when Ladies come to Visit me, I do
not use to tyre them of my Company so soon,
that's as Ill-natured, <HI>says she,</HI> as you could possi∣bly
talk, pray don't Pretend I came to Visit
you, I am satisfy'd who I came to Visit, and sa∣tisfy'd
that you know it; yes Madam, <HI>said I,</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
but if I happen to be all of the Family that's left
at home, then you came to Visit me.</P>
<P>I never receive Visits from those that I hate,
<HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have me there indeed, <HI>said I,</HI> but you never
gave me leave to tell you, why I hated you, I
hated you because you would never give me an
Opportuity to tell you I lov'd you; sure you
took me for some frightful Creature that you
would never come near enough, so much as to
Whisper to you that I love you.</P>
<P>I never care to hear any thing so disagreeable,
<HI>says she,</HI> tho' it be spoken ever so softly.</P>
<P>WE rallyed thus for an Hour; in short, she show∣ed
the abundance of her Wit, and I an abundant
defficiency of mine; for tho' three or four times she
provok'd me to the last degree; so that once I was
going to tell her I had enough of her Company,
and if she pleas'd I would wait upon her to the
Door; yet she had always so much Witchcraft on
her Tongue, that she brought herself off again; till
to make the Story short, we came at last to talk
seriously on both Sides about Matrimony, and
she heard me freely proposed it, and answered me
directly upon many occasions: For Example, she
told me, I would carry her away to <HI>France,</HI> or to
<HI>Virginia,</HI> and that she could not think of leaving
<HI>England,</HI> her native Country; I told her I hop'd
she did not take me for a Kidnapper: By the way,
I did not tell her how I had been Kidnapp'd my∣self:
She said no, but the Consequence of my
Affairs, which were it seems mostly Abroad, might
oblige me to go, and she could never think of
Marrying any Man, that she could not be content
to go all over the World with, if he had occasion
to go himself: This was handsomely expressed
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
indeed; I made her easie in that Point, and thus we
began the grand Parlee, which indeed she drew me
into with the utmost Art and Subtilty, such as was
peculiar to herself, but was infinitely her Ad∣vantage
in our Treating of Marriage; for she made
me effectually Court her, tho' at the same time
in her Design she Courted me with the utmost
Skill, and such Skill it was that her Design was
perfectly impenetrable to the last Moment.</P>
<P>IN short, we came nearer and nearer every time
we met, and after one casual Visit more, in
which I had the mighty Favour of talking with
her alone; I then waited on her every Day at her
own House or Lodgings rather, and so we set a∣bout
the Work to a purpose, and in about a Month
we gave the World the slip, and were privately
Marry'd to avoid Ceremony, and the publick In∣conveniency
of a Wedding.</P>
<P>WE soon found a House proper for our dwel∣ling,
and so went to House-keeping; we had not
been long together, but I found that gay Temper
of my Wife return'd, and she threw off the Mask
of her Gravity, and good Conduct, that I had so
long Fancy'd was her meer natural Disposition,
and now having no more occasion for Disguises,
she resolv'd to seem nothing but what really she
was, a wild untam'd Colt, perfectly loose, and
careless to conceal any part, no, not the worst of
her Conduct.</P>
<P>SHE carry'd on this Air of Levity to such an
Excess, that I could not but be dissatisfy'd at the
Expence of it, for she kept Company that I did not
like, liv'd beyond what I could support, and
sometimes lost at Play more than I car'd to pay:
Upon which, one Day, I took Occasion to men∣tion
it, but lightly; and said to her, by way of
<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
Rallery, that we liv'd merrily, for as long as
it would last; she turn'd short upon me, what do
ye mean, <HI>says she,</HI> Why, you don't pretend to be un∣easy
do ye? No, no, Madam, not I, by no means,
'tis no business of mine you know, <HI>said I,</HI> to en∣quire
what my Wife spends, or whether she spends
more than I can afford, or less, I only desire the
Favour to know as near as you can guess, how
long you will please to take to dispatch me, for
I would not be too long a dying.</P>
<P>I don't know what you talk of, <HI>says she,</HI> you
may die as leisurely, or as hastily as you please
when your time comes, I an't a going to kill you,
as I know of.</P>
<P>BUT you are a going to starve me Madam, <HI>said
she,</HI> and Hunger is as leisurely a Death, as breaking
upon the Wheel.</P>
<P>I starve you, Why are not you a great <HI>Virgi∣nia</HI>
Merchant, and did not I bring you 1500 <HI>l.</HI>
What would you have? sure, you can maintain
a Wife out of that can't you?</P>
<P>YES, Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> I could maintain a Wife,
but not a Gamfter, tho' you had brought me 1500 <HI>l.</HI>
a Year, no Estate is big enough for a Box and
Dice.</P>
<P>SHE took Fire at that, and flew out in a Pas∣sion,
and after a great many bitter Words, told
me in short, that she saw no occasion to alter
her Conduct, and as for my not maintaining her,
when I could not maintain her longer, she would
find some way or other to maintain herself.</P>
<P>SOMETIME after the first Rattle of this kind,
she vouchsafed to let me know that she was pleas'd
to be with Child; I was at first glad of it, in
hopes it would help to abate her Madness; but
it was all one, and her being with Child; only
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
added to the rest, for she made such Preparations
for her lying in, and the other Appendixes of a
Childs being born, that in short, I found she would
be down right Distracted, and I took the Liberty
to tell her one Day, that she would soon bring
herself and me to Destruction, and entreated her
to consider that such Figures as those were quite
above us, and out of our Circle; and in short, that
I neither could, nor would allow such Expences,
that at this Rate, two or three Children would
effectually ruin me, and that I desir'd her to con∣sider
what she was doing.</P>
<P>SHE told me with an Air of disdain, that it
was none of her Business to consider any thing of
that matter, that if I could not allow it, she
would allow it her self, and I might do my worst.</P>
<P>I begg'd her to consider things for all that, and
not drive me to Extremities, that I married her
to love and cherish her, and use her as a good
Wife ought to be us'd, but not to be ruin'd, and
undone by her. In a Word, nothing could mo∣lifie
her, nor any Argument perswade her to Mo∣deration,
but withal took it so heiniously that I
should pretend to restrain her, that she told me
in so many Words, she would drop her Burthen
with me, and then if I did not like it, she would
take care of herself, she would not live with me
an Hour, for she would not be restrain'd not she,
and talk'd a long while at that Rate.</P>
<P>I told her, as to her Child, which she call'd her
Burthen, it should be no Burthen to me, as to the
rest, she might do as she pleas'd; it might however
do me this Favour, that I should have no more Ly∣ings-Inn
at the rate of 136 <HI>l.</HI> at a time, as I found
she intended it should be now; she told me she
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
cou'd not tell that, if she had no more by me, she
hop'd she should by some Body else; say you so
Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> then they that get them, shall keep
them? She did not know that neither, <HI>she said,</HI>
and so turn'd it off Jearing, and as it were Laugh∣ing
at me.</P>
<P>THIS last Discourse Nettl'd me, I must Con∣fess,
and the more, because I had a great deal of
it, and very often, till in short, we began at
length to enter into a Friendly Treaty about
Parting.</P>
<P>NOTHING cou'd be more Criminal than the se∣veral
Discourses we had upon this Subject; she de∣manding
a separate Maintenance, and in particu∣lar
at the Rate of 300 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and I demanded
Security of her, that she should not run me in
Debt; she Demanded the keeping of the Child,
with an Allowance of 100 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for that, and
I Demanding that I should be secur'd from being
Charg'd for keeping any she might have by some
Body else, as she had threaten'd me.</P>
<P>IN the Interval, and during these Contests, she
Drop'd her Burthen, <HI>as she call'd it,</HI> and brought
me a Son, a very fine Child.</P>
<P>SHE was Content during her lying in, to abate
a little, tho' it was but a very little indeed, of
the great Expence she had intended; and with
some Difficulty and Perswasion was content with
a Suit of Child-bed-linnen of 15 <HI>l.</HI> instead of one
she had intended of Threescore; and this she mag∣nified
as a particular Testimony of her Condescen∣sion,
and a yielding to my Avaricious Temper, <HI>as
she call'd it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after she was up again, it was the same
thing, and she went on with her Humour to that
Degree, that in a little time she began to carry
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
it on to other Excesses, and to have a sort of Fellows
come to Visit her, which I did not like, and once
in particular, stay'd Abroad all Night: The next
Day when she came Home, she began to Cry out
first; told me where (as she said) she lay, and that
the Occasion was a Christening, where the Com∣pany
had a Feast, and stay'd too late; that if I
was dissatisfied, I might inform my self there of
all the particulars, where she lay, <HI>and the like;</HI>
I told her coldly, Madam, you do well to Suggest
my being dissatisfied, for you may be sure I am,
and you cou'd expect no other; that as to going
to your Haunts to inform my self, that's not my
Business; 'tis your Business to bring Testimonies
of your Behaviour, and to prove where you lay,
and in what Company, 'tis enough to me that you
lay out of your own House, without your Hus∣bands
Knowledge or Consent, and before you and I
Converse again, I must have some Satisfaction of
the particulars.</P>
<P>SHE answer'd, with all her Heart, she was as
Indifferent as I, and since I took so ill her lying
at a Friend's House, on an extraordinary Occasion,
she gave me to understand that it was what she
would have me expect, and what she would have
the Liberty to do, when she thought fit.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> if I must expect what
I cannot allow, you must expect I shall shut my
Doors by Day, against those that keep out of them
at Night.</P>
<P>SHE would try me, <HI>she said,</HI> very speedily, and
if I shut the Doors against her, she would find a∣way
to make me open them.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, <HI>says I,</HI> you threaten me hard,
but I would advise you to consider before you
take such Measures, for I shall be as good as my
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
Word: However, it was not long that we cou'd
live together upon these Terms; for I found very
quickly what Company she kept, and that she
took a Course which I ought not to bear; so I be∣gan
the Separation first, and refus'd her my Bed:
We had indeed refrain'd all Converse as Husband
and Wife for about two Months before; for I told
her very plainly, I would Father no Brats that
were not of my own getting; and Matters coming
thus Gradually to an Extremity, too great to con∣tinue
as it was; she went off one Afternoon,
and left me a Line in Writing, signifying that
Affairs were come to such a pass between us, that
she did not think fit to give me the Opportunity
of shutting her out of Doors, and that therefore,
she had retir'd her self to such a Place; naming,
a Relation of her own, as scandalous as her self;
and that she hop'd I would not give her the trou∣ble
to Sue for her Support, in the ordinary Course
of Law; but that as her Occasions requir'd, she
should draw Bills upon me, which she expected I
would not refuse.</P>
<P>I was extremely satisfied with this proceeding,
and took care to let her hear of it, tho' I gave no
answer at all to her Letter, and as I had taken
care before, that whenever she play'd such a
Prank as this, she should not be able to carry
much with her; so after she was gone, I immedi∣ately
broke up House-keeping, sold my Furni∣ture
by Publick out-cry, and in it every thing in
particular that was her own, and set a Bill upon
my Door, giving her to understand by it, that
she had pass'd <HI>the Rubicon,</HI> that as she had taken
such a step of her own Accord, so there was no
room left her, ever to think of coming back again.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="259"/>
THIS was what any one may believe I should
not have done, if I had seen any Room for a Re∣formation,
but she had given me such Testimo∣nies
of a Mind alienated from her Husband in
particular, Espousing her own unsufferable Levi∣ty,
that there was indeed no possibility of our
coming afterwards to any Terms again.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I kept a Couple of trusty Agents
so near her, that I fail'd not to have a full Ac∣count
of her Conduct, tho' I never let her know
any thing of me, but that I was gone over to
<HI>France;</HI> as to her Bills which she said she would
draw upon me, she was as good as her Word in
drawing one of 30 <HI>l.</HI> which I refus'd to accept,
and never gave her leave to trouble me with
another.</P>
<P>IT is true, and I must acknowledge it, that all
this was a very Melancholy Scene of Life to me,
and but that she took Care by carrying her self
to the last Degree Provoking, and continually to
Insult me; I cou'd never have gone on to the
parting, with so much Resolution, for I really
lov'd her very sincerely, and could have been
any thing but a Beggar, and a Cuckold with her,
but those were intollerable to me, especially, as
they were put upon me with so much Insult, and
Rudeness.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife carried it at last to a Point that
made all things light and easy to me, for after a∣bove
a Years Separation, and keeping such Com∣pany
as she thought fit, she was pleas'd to be
with Child again, in which she had, however, so
much Honesty, as not to pretend that she had had
any thing to do with me; what Wretched Life
she led after this, and how she brought her self
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
to the utmost Extremity of Misery and Distress,
I may speak of hereafter.</P>
<P>I had found soon after our Parting, that I had
a great deal of Reason to put my self into a Po∣sture
at first, not to be impos'd upon by her; for
I found very quickly that she had run her self in∣to
Debt in several Places very Considerably; and
that it was upon a Supposition, that I was liable
to those Debts: But I was gone, and it was Ab∣solutely
necessary I should do so; upon which,
she found her self oblig'd out of her wicked Gains,
however, whatever she made of them to Discharge
most those Debts her self.</P>
<P>AS soon as she was deliver'd of her Child, in
which my Intelligence was so good, that I had
gotten sufficient Proof of it; I Sued her in the
Ecclesiastick Court, in order to obtain a Divorce,
and as she found it impossible to avoid it, so she
declin'd the Defence, and I gain'd a legal Decree,
<HI>or what they call it,</HI> of Divorce, in the usual time
of such Process, and now I thought my self a
Freeman once again, and began to be Sick of
Wedlock, with all my Heart.</P>
<P>I liv'd retir'd, because I knew she had Con∣tracted
Debts, which I should be oblig'd to Pay,
and I was resolv'd to be gone out of her reach,
with what Speed I cou'd, but it was necessary that
I should stay till the <HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet came in; be∣cause
I look'd for at least 300 Hhds of <HI>Tobacco</HI>
from thence, which I knew would heal all my
Breaches; for indeed, the Extravagance of three
Years with this Lady, had sunk me most effectu∣ally;
even far beyond her own Fortune, which
was Considerable, tho' not quite 1500 <HI>l. as she had
call'd it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="261"/>
BUT all the Mischiefs I met with on Ac∣count
of this Match, were not over yet, for when
I had been parted with her about three Months,
and had refus'd to accept her Bill of 30 <HI>l.</HI> which
I mention'd above, tho' I was remov'd from my
first Lodgings too, and thought I had effectually
secur'd myself from being found out, yet there
came a Gentleman well Dress'd to my Lodgings
one Day, and was let in before I knew of it,
or else I should scarce have admitted him.</P>
<P>HE was led into a Parlour, and I came down
to him in my Gown and Slippers; when I came
into the Room, he call'd me as familiary by my
Name, as if he had known me twenty Year, and
pulling out a Pocket-Book, he shows me a Bill
upon me, drawn by my Wife, which was the same
Bill for thirty Pound that I had refus'd before.</P>
<P>SIR, <HI>says I,</HI> this Bill has been presented before,
and I gave my answer to it then.</P>
<P>ANSWER! Sir, <HI>says he, with a kind of jeering
taunting Air,</HI> I don't understand what you mean
by an answer, it is not a Question Sir, it is a Bill
to be paid.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> it is a Bill, I know that, and
I gave my answer to it before.</P>
<P>SIR, Sir, says he, <HI>very saucily,</HI> your Answer,
there's no Answer to a Bill, it must be paid, Bills
are to be paid, not to be answered, they say you
are a Merchant, Sir, Merchants always pay their
Bills.</P>
<P>I begun to be angry too a little, but I did not
like my Man, for I found he began to be Quar∣relsome;
however <HI>I said,</HI> Sir, I perceive you are
not much us'd to presenting Bills; Sir, a Bill is
always first presented, and presenting, is a Questi∣on,
'tis asking if I will accept, or pay the Bill,
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
and then whether I say yes, or no, 'tis an answer
one way, or other; after 'tis accepted, it indeed
requires no more answer but Payment when 'tis
due, if you please to inform yourself, this is
the usage which all Merchants or Tradsemen of
any kind who have Bills drawn upon them, Act by.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> and what then? what is this
to the paying me the thirty Pounds?</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>says I,</HI> it is this to it, that I told the
Person that brought it, I should not pay it.</P>
<P>NOT pay it, <HI>says he,</HI> but you shall pay it; ay,
ay, you will pay it.</P>
<P>SHE that draws it, has no Reason to draw any
Bills upon me, I am sure, <HI>said I,</HI> and I shall pay
no Bills she draws, I assure you.</P>
<P>UPON this he turns short upon me, Sir, she
that draws this Bill is a Person of too much
Honour to draw any Bill without Reason, and
'tis an Affront to say so of her, and I shall expect
satisfaction of you for that by itself, but first
the Bill Sir, the Bill, you must pay, the Bill, Sir.</P>
<P>I return'd as short, Sir, I Affront no Body, I
know the Person as well as you, I hope, and
what I have said of her, is no Affront, she can
have no Reason to draw Bills upon me, for I
owe her nothing.</P>
<P>I omit intermingling the Oaths he lac'd his
Speech with, as too foul for my Paper, but he
told me he would make me know, she had Friends
to stand by her, that I had abus'd her, and he
would let me know it, and do her Justice; but
first, I must pay his Bill.</P>
<P>I answer'd in short, I would not pay the Bill,
nor any Bills he should draw.</P>
<P>WITH that he steps to the Door, and shuts it,
and swore by G—d he would make me pay the
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
Bill before we parted, and laid his Hand upon
his Sword, but did not draw it out.</P>
<P>I confess I was frighted to the last degree, for I
had no Sword, and if I had, I must own that tho' I
had learn'd a great many good things in <HI>France</HI> to
make me look like a Gentleman; I had forgot
the main Article, of learning, how to use a Sword,
a thing so universally practis'd there; and to say
more, I had been perfectly unacquainted with
Quarrels of this Nature; so that I was perfectly
surpris'd when he shut the Door, and knew not
what to say or do.</P>
<P>HOWEVER as it happen'd, the People of the
House hearing us pretty loud, came near the
Door, and made a Noise in the Entry, to let me
know they were at Hand, and one of the Servants
going to open the Door, and finding it lock'd,
call'd out to me, <HI>Sir, for Godsake open the Door,</HI>
What is the matter? <HI>Shall we fetch a Constable?</HI>
I made no Answer, but it gave me Courage,
so I sat down compos'd, in one of the Chairs,
and said to him, Sir, this is not the way to
make me pay the Bill, you had much better be
easy, and take your satisfaction another way.</P>
<P>HE understood me of Fighting, which upon
my Word, was not in my Thoughts, but I meant
that he had better take his Course at Law.</P>
<P>WITH all my heart, <HI>says he,</HI> they say, you are
a Gentleman, and they call you Colonel; now
if you are a Gentleman, I accept your Chal∣lenge,
Sir, and if you will walk out with me I'll
take it for full payment of the Bill, and will de∣cide
it as Gentlemen ought to do.</P>
<P>I Challenge you, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> not I, I made no
Challenge, I said, this is not the way to make me
pay a Bill, that I have not accepted, <HI>that is,</HI> that
you had better seek your satisfaction at Law.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="264"/>
LAW! <HI>says he,</HI> Law! Gentleman's Law is
my Law; in short, Sir, you shall pay me, or
Fight me; and then, as if he had mistaken, he
turns short upon me; nay, <HI>says he,</HI> you shall both
Fight me and pay me, for I will maintain her Ho∣nour;
and in saying this, he bestow'd about six
or seven Damme's and Oaths, by way of Paren∣thesis.</P>
<P>THIS interval deliver'd me effectually, for
just as the Word <HI>fight me,</HI> for I will maintain her
Honour, the Maid had brought in a Constable
with three or four Neighbours to assist him.</P>
<P>HE heard them come in, and began to be a
little in a Rage, and ask'd if I intended to Mob
him, instead of paying, and laying his Hand on
his Sword told me, if any Man offered to break
in upon him, he would run me thro' the first
Moment, that he might have the fewer to deal
with afterwards.</P>
<P>I told him he knew I had call'd for no help, be∣lieving
he could not be in earnest in what he
had said, and that if any Body attempted to
come in upon us, it was to prevent the Mischief
he Threaten'd, and which he might see I had no
Weapons to resist.</P>
<P>UPON this the Constable call'd, and charg'd
us both in the King's Name to open the Door, I
was sitting in a Chair, and offer'd to rise, he
made a Motion, as if he would draw, upon which
I sat down again, and the Door not being open'd,
the Constable set his Foot against it and came in</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>says my Gentleman,</HI> And what now?
What's your Business here? Nay, Sir, <HI>says the
Constable,</HI> you see my Business, I am a Peace-Officer,
all I have to do is to keep the Peace, and I find,
the People of the House frighted for fear of Mis∣chief
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
should be between you, have fetch'd me to
prevent it; what Mischief have they suppos'd you
should finds; <HI>says he,</HI> I suppose, <HI>says the Constable,</HI>
they were afraid you should Fight; that's because
they did not know this Fellow here, he never
fights, they call him Colonel, <HI>says he,</HI> I suppose
he might be born a Colonel, for I dare say, he
was born a Coward; he never Fights, he dares not
see a Man, if he would have fought he would have
walk'd out with me; but he scorns to be Brave,
they would never have talk'd to you of Fight∣ing,
if they had known him; I tell you Mr. Con∣stable
he is a Coward, and a Coward is a Rascal;
and with that he came to me, and strok'd his
Finger down my Nose pretty hard, and laugh'd
and mock'd most horridly, as if I was a
Coward; now for ought I knew it might be true,
but I was now what they call a Coward made de∣sperate,
which is one of the worst of Men in the
World to Encounter with, for being in a Fury I
threw my Head in his Face, and Closing with
him, threw him fairly on his Back, by main
Stength, and had not the Constable step'd in, and
taken me off, I had certainly stamp'd him to
Death, with my Feet, for my Blood was now all
in a Flame, and the People of the House were
frighted now as much the other way, least I should
kill him, tho' I had no Weapon at all in my
Hand.</P>
<P>THE Constable too reprov'd me in his turn,
but I said to him, Mr. <HI>Constable,</HI> don't you think
I am sufficiently Provok'd? Can any Man bear
such things as these, I desire to know who this
Man is, and who sent him hither?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="266"/>
I am, <HI>says he,</HI> a Gentleman, and come with a
Bill to him for Money, and he refuses to Pay it;
well, says the <HI>Constable,</HI> very Prudently, that's
none of my Business, I am no Justice of Peace to
hear the Cause, be that among your selves; but
keep your Hands off one another, and that's as
much as I desire; and therefore, Sir, says the <HI>Con∣stable</HI>
to him, if I may advise you, seeing he will
not Pay the Bill, and that must be Decided be∣tween
you as the Law directs, I would have you
leave it for the present, and go quietly away.</P>
<P>HE made many Impertinent Harangues about
the Bill, and insisted, that it was drawn by my
own Wife; I said angrily, then it was drawn by a
Whore, he Bullied me upon that, told me I durst
not tell him so any where else; and I answer'd,
I would very soon Publish her for a Whore to all
the World, and Cry her down, and thus we scolded
for near half an Hour, for I took Courage when
the <HI>Constable</HI> was there, for I knew that he would
keep us from Fighting, which indeed I had no
Mind to, and so at length I got Rid of him.</P>
<P>I was heartily vext at this Rencounter, and
the more, because I had been found out in my
Lodging, which I thought I had effectually Con∣ceal'd:
However, I resolv'd to remove the next
Day, and in the mean time I kept within Doors
all that Day till the Evening, and then I went
out in order not to return thither any more.</P>
<P>BEING come out into <HI>Grace-church-street,</HI> I ob∣serv'd
a Man follow'd me, with one of his Legs tied
up in a String, and Hopping along with the other,
and two Crutches; he begg'd for a Farthing, but
I inclining not to give him any thing, the Fellow
follow'd me still, till I came to a Court, when I an∣swer'd
hastily to him, I have not for you, pray
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
don't be so troublesome; with which Words he
knock'd me down with one of his Crutches.</P>
<P>BEING stunn'd with the blow I knew nothing
what was done to me afterwards; but coming to
myself again, I found I was wounded very fright∣fully
in several Places, and that among the rest
my Nose was slit upwards, one of my Ears cut
almost off, and a great cut with a Sword on the
Side of my Forehead, also a stab into the Body,
tho' not Dangerous.</P>
<P>WHO had been near me, or stuck me, besides
the Cripple that struck me with his Crutch I
knew not, nor do I know to this Hour, but I was
terribly wounded, and lay bleeding on the Ground,
sometime, till coming to myself I got strength to
cry out for help, and People coming about me,
I got some Hands to carry me to my Lodging,
where I lay by it more than two Months, before
I was well enough to go out of Doors, and when I
did go out, I had Reason to believe that I was
waited for by some Rogues, who watch'd an op∣portunity
to repeat the injury I had met with
before.</P>
<P>THIS made me very uneasie, and I resolv'd
to get myself out of Danger, if possible, and to
go over to <HI>France,</HI> or home, <HI>as I call'd it,</HI> to <HI>Vir∣ginia;</HI>
so to be out of the way of Villains, and
Assassinations; for every time I stirr'd out here, I
thought I went in danger of my Life, and there∣fore,
as before I went out at Night, thinking to
be conceal'd; so now I never went out, but in
open Day that I might be safe, and never with∣out
one or two Servants to be my Life Guard.</P>
<P>BUT I must do my Wife a peice of Justice
here too, and that was that hearing of what had
befallen me she wrote me a Letter, in which
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
she treated me more Decently than she had been
wont to do, said she was very sorry to hear how I
had been used, and the rather because she under∣stood
it was on presenting her Bill to me; she
said she hop'd I could not in my worst Disposi∣tions
think so hardly of her, as to believe it was
done by her Knowledge, or Consent, much less by
her Order, or Direction; that she abhorr'd such
things, and Protested if she had the least Know∣ledge,
or so much as a guess at the Villains con∣cern'd
she would Discover them to me; she let me
know the Persons Name to whom she gave the
Bill, and where he liv'd, and left it to me to o∣blige
him to discover the Person who had brought
it and us'd me so ill, and wish'd I might find him,
and bring him to Justice, and have him punish'd
with the utmost severity of the Law.</P>
<P>I TOOK this so kindly of my Wife, that I
think in my Conscience, had she come after it
herself, to see how I did, I had certainly taken her
again; but she satisfy'd herself with the Civility
of another Letter, and desiring me to let her
know as often as I could how I was, adding, that
it would be infinitely to her satisfaction to hear I
was recover'd of the hurt I had receiv'd, and that
he was hang'd at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> who had done it.</P>
<P>SHE us'd some Expressions, signifying as I un∣derstood
them, her Affliction at our parting, and
her continu'd Respect for me, but did not make
any Motion towards returning; then she us'd
some Arguments, to move me to pay her Bills, in∣timating
that she had brought me a large For∣tune,
and now had nothing to subsist, which was
very severe.</P>
<P>I Wrote her an Answer to this Letter, tho' I had
not to the other, letting her know how I had been
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
us'd, that I was satisfied upon her Letter, that
she had no hand in it; that it was not in her Na∣ture
to treat me so, who had never injur'd her,
us'd any Violence with her, or been the Cause,
or desire of our parting; that as to her Bill, she
could not but know how much her Expensive
way of living, had straitn'd, and reduc'd me, and
would if continu'd have ruin'd me, that she had
in less than three Years spent more than as much
as she brought to me, and would not abate her
Expensive way tho' calmly intreated by me, with
Protestations, that I could not Support so great
an Expence, but Chose rather to break up her
Family, and go from me, than to restrain her∣self
to reasonable Limits, tho' I used no Violence
with her, but Entreaties, and earnest Perswasions,
back'd with good Reasons; letting her know how
my Estate was, and convincing her that it must
reduce us to Poverty at least; that however, if
she would recal her Bill, I would send her 30 <HI>l.</HI>
which was the Sum mention'd in her Bill, and ac∣cording
to my Ability would not let her want,
if she pleas'd to live within due Bounds; but
then I let her know also, that I had a very bad Ac∣count
of her Conduct, and that she kept Company
with a scandalous Fellow, who I Nam'd to her;
that I was loth to believe such things of her, but
that to put an entire End to the Report, and Re∣store
her Reputation; I let her know that still
after all I had heard, if she would resolve to
live without Restraints, within the reasonable
Bounds of my Capacity, and Treat me with the
same Kindness and Affection, and Tenderness, as
I always had Treated her, and ever would: I
was willing to receive her again, and would for∣get
all that was past; but that if she declin'd
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
me now, it would be for ever, for if she did not
accept my offer, I was resolv'd to stay here no
longer, where I had been so ill Treated on many
Occasions; but was preparing to go into my own
Country, where I would spend my Days in Quiet,
and in a Retreat from the World.</P>
<P>SHE did not give such an Answer to this, as I
expected; for tho' she thank'd me for the 30 <HI>l.</HI>
yet she insisted upon her Justification in all other
Points, and tho' she did not refuse to return to
me, yet she did not say she Accepted it, and in
short, said little or nothing to it, only a kind of
Claim to a Reparation of her Injur'd Reputation,
<HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gave me some Surprize at first, for I thought
indeed, any Woman in her Circumstances would
have been very willing to have put an End to all
her Miseries, and to the Reproach that was upon
her, by a Reconciliation; especially, considering
she subsisted at that time, but very meanly: But
there was a particular Reason, which prevented
her return, and which she cou'd not Plead to
me in her Letter, yet was a good Reason against
accepting an offer, which she would otherwise
have been glad of, and this was that, as I have
mention'd above, she had fallen into bad Com∣pany,
and had prostituted her Vertue to some of
her Flatterers, and in short, was with Child; so
that she durst not venture to accept my offer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I observe above, she did not ab∣solutely
refuse it, intending (as I understood af∣terward,)
to keep the Treaty of it on Foot, till
she could Drop her Burthen, as she had call'd it
before; and having been deliver'd privately,
have accepted my Proposal afterward: And in∣deed,
this was the most Prudent step she cou'd
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
take, or, as we may say, the only step she had
lest to take: But I was too many for her here too,
my Intelligence about her was too good, for her to
Conceal such an Affair from me, unless she had
gone away before she was visibly Big, and unless
she had gone farther off too than she did, for I
had an Account to a Tittle, of the time when-and
Place where, and the Creature of which she
was deliver'd, and then my Offers of taking her a∣gain
were at an End, tho' she Wrote me several
very Penitent Letters, acknowledging her Crime,
and begging me to forgive her; but my Spirit
was above all that now, nor cou'd I ever bear the
Thoughts of her after that: But persued a Di∣vorce,
and accordingly obtain'd it, as I have men∣tion'd
already.</P>
<P>THINGS being at this pass, I resolv'd, as I
have observ'd above, to go over to <HI>France,</HI> after
I had receiv'd my Effects from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and ac∣cordingly
I came to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in the Year—and
here I fell into Company with some <HI>Irish</HI>
Officers of the Regiment of <HI>Dillon,</HI> who by little
and little Enter'd me into the Army, and by the
help of Lieutenant General—an <HI>Irishman,</HI> and
some Money, I obtain'd a Company in his Regi∣ment,
and so went into the Army directly.</P>
<P>I was exceedingly pleas'd with my new Cir∣cumstances,
and now I us'd to say to my self, I
was come to what I was Born to, and that I had
never till now liv'd the Life of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>OUR Regiment, after I had been some time in
it, was Commanded into <HI>Italy,</HI> and one of the
most considerable Actions that I was in, was the
Famous Attack upon <HI>Cremona,</HI> in the <HI>Millanese,</HI>
where the <HI>Germans</HI> being Privately, and by
Treachery let into the Town in the Night, thro'
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
a kind of Common-Shoar, surpriz'd the Town,
and got possession of the greatest Part of it, sur∣prizing
the Mareschal Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> and ta∣king
him Prisoner as he came out of his Quarters,
and beating the few <HI>French</HI> Troops, which were
left, into the Citadel: But were in the middle of
their Victory so boldly, and resolutely attack'd
by two <HI>Irish</HI> Regiments, who were Quarter'd in the
<HI>Street</HI> leading to the River <HI>Po,</HI> and who kept Pos∣session
of the Water-Gate, or <HI>Po</HI> Gate of the Town,
by which the <HI>German</HI> Reinforcements should
have come in, that after a most desperate Fight,
the <HI>Germans</HI> had their Victory wrung out of their
Hands, and not being able to break thro' us to let
in their Friends, were oblig'd at length to quit the
Town again, to the eternal Honour of those <HI>Irish</HI>
Regiments, and indeed of their whole Nation, and
for which we had a very handsome Compliment
from the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW had the satisfaction of knowing, and
that for the first time too, that I was not that
cowardly low spirited Wretch, that I was, when
the Fellow Bullied me in my Lodgings, about
the Bill of 30 <HI>l.</HI> had he attack'd me now, tho' in
the very same Condition, I should naked and
unarm'd as I was have flown in the Face of him,
and trampl'd him under my Feet; but Men never
know themselves till they are tried, and Cou∣rage
is acquir'd by time, and Experience of
things.</P>
<P><HI>Philip de Comines,</HI> tells us, that after the Bat∣tle
of <HI>Monteleri,</HI> the Count de <HI>Charolois,</HI> who till
then had an utter Aversion to the War, and ab∣horr'd
it, and every thing that belong'd to it,
was so chang'd by the Glory he obtain'd in that
Action, and by the Flattery of those about him, that
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
afterwards, the Army was his Mistress, and the
Fateigues of the War his chief Delight, 'tis too great
an Example for me to bring in my own Case, but
so it was, that they Flattered me so with my bra∣very
as they call'd it on the Occasion of this
Action, that I fancy'd myself Brave, whether I
was so or not, and the Pride of it made me Bold,
and Daring to the last Degree on all Occasions;
but what added to it, was, that some Body gave
a particular Account to the Court of my being In∣strumental
to the saving the City and the whole
<HI>Cremonese,</HI> by my extraordinary Defence of the <HI>Po</HI>
Gate, and by my Managing that Defence after
the Lieutenant Colonel, who Commanded the Par∣ty
where I was Posted was kill'd; upon which,
the King sent me a publick Testimony of his
accepting my Service, and sent me a Breviat
to be a Lieutenant Colonel, and the next Courier
brought me actually a Commission for Lieute∣nant
Colonel in the Regiment of—.</P>
<P>I WAS in several Skirmishes and petty En∣counters
before this, by which I gain'd the Repu∣tation
of a good Officer, but I happen'd to be in
some particular Posts too, by which I got some∣what
that I lik'd much better, and that was a good
deal of Money.</P>
<P>OUR Regiment was sent from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Italy</HI>
by Sea, we embark'd at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> and Landed at
<HI>Savona</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and march'd
from thence to the Dutchy of <HI>Millan:</HI> At
the first Town we were sent to take Possession
of, which was <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Citizens rose upon
our Men in a most furious manner, and drove the
whole Garrison, which consisted of 800 Men, that
is <HI>French,</HI> and Soldiers in the <HI>French</HI> Service quite
out of the Town.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="274"/>
I was Quarter'd in a Burghers House, just by one
of the Ports with Eight of my Men, and a Servant;
where calling a short Council with my Men, we
resolv'd to maintain the House we was in, what∣ever
it Cost, till we receiv'd Order to quit it from
the Commanding Officer; and upon this, when I
saw our Men cou'd not stand their Ground in the
Street, being press'd hard by the Citizens, I
turn'd out of Doors all the Family, and kept the
House, as a Castle which I was Governor in; and
as the House join'd to the City Gate, I resolv'd
to maintain it, so as to be the last that should
quit the Place, my own Retreat being secur'd by
being so near the Port.</P>
<P>HAVING thus emptyed the House of the Inha∣bitants,
we made no Scruple of filling our Pock∣ets
with whatever we could find there, in a Word,
we left nothing we could carry away; among
which, it came to my Lot to Dip into the Bur∣ghers
Cabinet, whose House it was where we were;
and there I took about the Quantity of 200 Pi∣stols
in Money and Plate, and other things of Va∣lue.
There was great Complaint made to Prince
<HI>Vaudemont,</HI> who was then Governor of the <HI>Milla∣nese</HI>
of this Violence; but as the Repulse the Ci∣tizens
gave us, was contrary to his Order, and to
the general Design of the Prince, who was then
wholy in the Interest of King <HI>Philip,</HI> the Citizens
cou'd obtain nothing, and I found, that if we had
Plunder'd the whole City, it would have been the
same thing; for the Governor had Order to take
our Regiment in, and it was an Act of open Re∣bellion
to resist us as they did; however, we had
orders not to Fire upon the Burghers, unless con∣strain'd
to it by evident Necessity, and we rather
chose to quit the Place, as we did, then Dispute it
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
with a Desperate Body of Fellows, who wanted
no Advantage of us, except only that, of having
Possession of two Bastions, and one Port for our
Retreat; first they were Treble our Number, for
the Burghers being join'd by seven Companies of
the regular Troops, made up above 1600 Men,
besides Rabble which was many more; whereas,
we were about 800 in all; they also had the Cit∣tadel
and several Peices of Cannon, so that we
cou'd have made nothing of it, if we had attack'd
them; but they submitted three or four Days af∣ter
to other Forces, the Soldiers within turning
upon them, and taking the Cittadel from them.</P>
<P>AFTER this, we lay still in Quarters 8 Months,
for the Prince having secur'd the whole <HI>Millanese</HI>
for King <HI>Philip,</HI> and no Enemy appearing for
some time, had nothing to do, but to receive the
Auxiliar Troops of <HI>France;</HI> and as they came,
extend himself every way as he cou'd, in order
to keep the Imperialists (who were preparing to
fall into <HI>Italy</HI> with a great Army) as much at a
Distance as possible, which he did, by taking
Possession of the City of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and of most of
the Towns on that Side, as far as the Lake <HI>dela
Guarda,</HI> and the River <HI>Addige.</HI></P>
<P>WE lay in <HI>Mantua</HI> some time, but were after∣wards
drawn out by Order of the Count <HI>de Tesse,</HI>
(afterwards Marshal of <HI>France</HI>) to Form the <HI>French</HI>
Army, till the Arrival of the Duke <HI>de Vandosme,</HI>
who was to Command in Chief. Here we had a
Severe Campaign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1701. having Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and an Army of 40000 <HI>Germans,</HI>
all old Soldiers to deal with, and tho' the <HI>French</HI>
Army was more Numerous than the Enemy,
by 25000 Men, yet being on the Defensive,
and having so many Posts to Cover, not know∣ing
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
exactly where the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who com∣manded
the Imperial Army would attack us; it
oblig'd the <HI>French</HI> to keep their Troops so divided;
and so remote from one another, that the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI>
push'd on their Design with great Success as
the Histories of those Times more fully relate.</P>
<P>I WAS at the Action at <HI>Carpi, July</HI> 1701,
where we were worsted by the <HI>Germans</HI> indeed,
were forc'd to quit our Encampment, and give
up to the Prince the whole River of <HI>Addige,</HI> and
where our Regiment sustain'd some Loss, but
the Enemies got little by us, and Monsieur <HI>Cati∣nate,</HI>
who Commanded at that time drew up in or∣der
of Battle the next Day in sight of the <HI>German</HI>
Army, and gave them a defiance, but they would
not stir, tho' we offer'd them Battle two Days
together, for having gain'd the Passage over the
<HI>Addige,</HI> by our quitting <HI>Rivoli,</HI> which was then
useless to us their Business was done.</P>
<P>FINDING they declin'd a decesive Action, our
Generals press'd them in their Quarters, and
made them fight for every Inch of Ground they
gain'd, and at length in the <HI>September</HI> following, we
attack'd them in their entrench'd Posts of <HI>Chiar,</HI>
here we broke into the very heart of their Camp,
where we made a very terrible Slaughter, but
I know not by what Mistake among our Ge∣nerals,
or Defect in the Execution of their
Orders, the Brigade of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and our <HI>Irish</HI>
Brigade, who had so Bravely enter'd the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Intrenchments were not supported as we
should have been, so that we were oblig'd to sus∣tain
the shock of the whole <HI>German</HI> Army, and
at last to quit the Advantage we had gain'd, and
that not without Loss, but being timely reinforc'd
by a great Body of Horse the Enemy were in
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
their Turn beaten off too, and driven back into
their very Camp: The <HI>Germans</HI> boasted of having
a great Victory here, and indeed in repulsing us
after we had gain'd their Camp they had the ad∣vantage,
but had Monsieur <HI>de Tesse</HI> succoured us
in time, as old <HI>Catinat</HI> said he ought to have
done, with 12000 Foot which he had with him,
that Days Action had put an End to the War, and
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> must have been glad to have gone
back to <HI>Germany</HI> in more hast than he came, if
perhaps we had not cut him short by the way.</P>
<P>BUT the Fate of things went another way,
and the <HI>Germans</HI> continu'd all that Campaign to
push forward, and advance one Post after another,
till they beat us quite out of the <HI>Millanese.</HI></P>
<P>THE latter part of this Campaign we made
only a party War, the <HI>French</HI> according to their
volatile Temper, being every Day abroad, ei∣ther
Forraging or surprizing the Enemies fo∣ragers,
plundering, or circumventing the Plunders
of the other Side, and that tho' they very often
come short home; for the <HI>Germans</HI> had the better
of them on several Occasions, and indeed so many
lost their lives upon those petty Encounters, that
I think including those who dyed of Distempers
gotten by hard Service, and bad Quarters, lying
in the Field, even till the middle of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
among Rivers, and Bogs in a Country so
full of Canals and Rivers, as that Part of <HI>Italy</HI>
is known to be, <HI>I say,</HI> we lost more Men, and so
did the Enemy also, than would have been lost in
a general decisive Battle.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> to give him his due,
press'd earnestly to put it to a Day, and come
to a Battle with Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> but the Duke
<HI>de Villeroy,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Catinate,</HI> and the Count <HI>de
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
Tesse</HI> were all against it, and the principal Rea∣son
was, that they knew the weakness of the
Troops, who had suffer'd so much on so many Oc∣casions,
that they were in no Condition to give
Battle to the <HI>Germans;</HI> so after, as <HI>I say,</HI> about
three Months Harrassing one another with Par∣ties
we went into Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>BEFORE we march'd out of the Field, our Re∣giment
with a Detachment of Dragoons of 600,
and about 250 Horse went without a Design to in∣tercept
Prince <HI>Commercy,</HI> a General of Note under
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy;</HI> the Detachment was
intended to be only Horse and Dragoons, but be∣cause
it was the Imperialists good luck to beat
many of our Parties, and as was given out, many
more than we beat of theirs; and because it was
believed that the Prince, who was an Officer of
good Note among them would not go abroad, but
in very Company; the <HI>Irish</HI> Regiment of Foot
was order'd to be added, that if possible they
might meet with their Match.</P>
<P>I WAS commanded about two Hours before, to
pass about 200 Foot, and 50 Dragoons, at a small
Wood, where our General had intelligence that
Prince would Post some Men, to secure his Pas∣sage,
which accordingly I did; but Count <HI>Tesse</HI>
not thinking our Party strong enough, had
march'd himself with a Thousand Horse, and 300
Grenadiers to Support us, and it was very well he
did so; for Prince <HI>Commercy</HI> having Intelligence of
the first Party, came forward sooner than they
expected, and fell upon them, and had entirely
Routed them, had not the Count hearing the
firing, advanc'd with the Thousand Horse he had
with such Expedition, as to support his Men in
the very heat of the Action, by which means the
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
<HI>Germans</HI> were defeated, and forc'd to retire, but
the Prince made a pretty good Retreat, and af∣ter
the Action came on to the Wood, where I was
posted, but the surprise of his Defeat had pre∣vented
his sending a Deteachment to secure the
Pass at the Wood, as he intended.</P>
<P>THE Count <HI>de Tesse,</HI> understanding that we
were sent, <HI>as above,</HI> to the Wood, follow'd them
close at the Heels to prevent our being cut off,
and if it were possible that we should give them
any Check at the Wood, to fall in, and have
another Brush with them; it was near Night be∣fore
they came to the Wood, by which means
they could not discern our Number, but when
they came up to the Wood, 50 Dragoons ad∣vanc'd
to discover the Pass, and see if all was
clear: These we suffer'd to pass a great way in∣to
the Defile, or Lane, that went thro' the
Wood, and then clapping in between them, and
the Enterance, cut off their Retreat so effectu∣ally,
that when they discover'd us, and fir'd,
they were instantly surrounded and cut in peices;
the Officer who commanded them, and eight
Dragoons only being made Prisoners.</P>
<P>THIS made the Prince halt, not knowing what
the Case was, or how strong we were, and to
get better Intelligence, sent 200 Horse to sur∣round
or Skirt the Wood, and beat up our Quar∣ter,
and in the intrim, the Count <HI>de Tesse</HI> appear'd,
in his Rear: We found the strait he was in, by the
Noise of our own Troops at a Distance, so we
resolv'd to Engage the 200 Horse immediately;
accordingly our little Troop of Horse drew up
in the Entrance of the Lane, and offer'd to Skir∣mish,
and our Foot lying behind the Hedge,
which went round the Wood, stood ready to act
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
as occasion should offer, the Horse being attack'd
gave way, and retir'd into the Lane, but the
<HI>Germans</HI> were too old for us there, they content∣ed
themselves to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h us to the Enterance,
but would not be drawn into a narrow Pass
without knowing whether the Hedges were Lin'd
or no.</P>
<P>BUT the Prince finding the <HI>French</HI> in his
Rear, and not being strong enough to Engage a∣gain,
resolv'd to force his way thro', and com∣manded
his Dragoons to alight, and enter the
Wood to clear the Hedges on either Side the
Lane, that he might pass with his Cavalry; this
they did so vigorously, and were so much too
strong for us, that tho' we made good our Ground a
long time, yet our Men were almost half of them
cut in peices. However, we gave time to the
<HI>French</HI> Cavalry to come up, and to fall on the
the Prince's Troops, and cut them off, and take
a great many Prisoners, and then retreated in our
Turn, opening a Gap for our own Horse to break
in; 300 of the Dragoons were kill'd, and 200 of
them taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>IN the first heat of this Action, a <HI>German</HI> Of∣ficer
of Dragoons well follow'd, had knock'd
down three of my Men that stood next me, and
offering me Quarter, I was oblig'd to accept it,
and gave him my Sword, for our Men were up∣on
the Point of quitting their Post, and shifting
every one as they could; but the Scale was turn'd,
for our Cavalry breaking in, <HI>as above,</HI> the Dragoons
went to wreck, and the Officer who had me Pri∣soner,
turning to me said, <HI>we are all Lost;</HI> I ask∣ed
him if I could serve him, stand still a little,
<HI>says he,</HI> for his Men fought most desperately in∣deed,
but about 200 <HI>French</HI> Horse appearing in
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
his Rear too, <HI>he said,</HI> to me in <HI>French,</HI> I will be
your Prisoner, and returning me my Sword, gave
me also his own; a Dragoon that stood near him
was just going to do the like when he was shot
dead, and the Horse coming up, the Field was
cleared in an Instant, but Prince <HI>Commercy</HI> went
off with the rest of his Party, and was pursued
no farther.</P>
<P>THERE were sixteen or seventeen of our Men
releas'd, as I was from being taken; but they
had not the luck I had, to take the Officer that
had them in keeping; he had been so generous to
me, as not to ask what Money I had about me,
tho' I had not much, if he had; but I lost by his
Civility, for then I could not have the Assurance
to ask him for his Money, tho' I understood he had
near a 100 Pistols about him; but he very hand∣somely
at Night, when we came to our Tents
made me a Present of 20 Pistols, and in return
I obtain'd leave for him to go to Prince <HI>Eugen</HI>'s
Camp upon his Parole, which he did, and so got
himself exchang'd.</P>
<P>IT was after this Campaign that I was Quar∣tered
at <HI>Cremona,</HI> when the Action happen'd
there, of which I have spoken already, and where
our <HI>Irish</HI> Regiment did such Service, that they
sav'd the Town from being really surpriz'd, and
indeed beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out again after they had
been Masters of three Quarters of the Town
six Hours, and by which they gain'd a very great
Reputation.</P>
<P>BUT I hasten on to my own History, for I
am not writing a Journal of the Wars, in which
I had no long Share.</P>
<P>THE Summer after this, our two <HI>Irish</HI> Regiments
were drawn out into the Field, and had many a
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Brush with the <HI>Germans,</HI> for Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI>
a vigilant General, gave us little Rest, and gain'd
many Advantages by his continual moving up
and down, Harrassing his own Men, and ours
too; and whoever will do the <HI>French</HI> Justice, and
knew how they had behaved, must ackowledge,
they never declin'd the <HI>Germans,</HI> but fought them
upon all Occasions, with the utmost Resolution
and Courage, and tho' it cost the Blood of an in∣finite
Number of fine Gentlemen, as well as
private Soldiers, yet the Duke <HI>de Vendome,</HI> who
now Commanded, tho' King <HI>Philip</HI> was himself
in the Army this Campaign, made the Prince of
<HI>Savoy</HI> a full return in his own kind, and drove
him from Post to Post, till he was just at the
Point of quitting the whole Country of <HI>Italy;</HI>
all that gallant Army Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> brought
with him into <HI>Italy,</HI> which was the best without
doubt, for the goodness of the Troops that ever
were there, laid their Bones in that Country, and
many Thousands more after them; till the Affairs
of <HI>France</HI> declining in other Places, they were
forc'd in their Turn to give way to their Fate, as
may be seen in the Histories of those Times, <HI>as
above,</HI> but 'tis none of my Business.</P>
<P>THE part that I bore in these Affairs was but
short and sharp, we took the Field about the be∣ginning
of <HI>July</HI> 1702, and the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI>
order'd the whole Army to draw the sooner toge∣ther,
in order to relieve the City of <HI>Mantua,</HI>
which was block'd up by the Imperialists.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Eugene</HI> was a Politick, and indeed a
fortunate Prince, and had the Year before push∣ed
our Army upon many Occasions; but his good
Fortune began to fail him a little this Year, for
our Army was not only more Numerous than his,
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
but the Duke was in the Field before him, and
as the Prince had held <HI>Mantua</HI> closely block'd up
all the Winter, the Duke resolv'd to relieve the
Town, cost what it would: As <HI>I said,</HI> the Duke
was first in the Field, the Prince was in no Con∣dition
to prevent his raising the Blockade by force;
so he drew off his Troops, and leaving several
strong Bodies of Troops to protect <HI>Bersello,</HI> which
the Duke <HI>de Vendomse</HI> threaten'd, and <HI>Borgofort,</HI>
where his Magazine lay, he drew all the rest of
his Forces together, to make Head against us; by
this time the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was come into the
Army, and the Duke <HI>de Vendomse</HI> lay, with about
35000 Men, near <HI>Luzara,</HI> which he had resolv'd
to attack, to bring Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to a Battle:
The Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> lay Entrench'd with
20000 more at <HI>Rivalto,</HI> behind <HI>Mantua,</HI> to cover
the Frontiers of <HI>Millan,</HI> and there was near 12000
in <HI>Mantua</HI> itself; and Monsieur <HI>Pracontal</HI> lay
with 10000 Men, just under the Cannon of one
of the Forts, which Guard the Causeway, which
leads into the City of <HI>Mantua:</HI> So that had all
these joyn'd, as they would have done in a few
Days more, the Prince must have been put to his
shifts, and would have had enough to do, to have
maintain'd himself in <HI>Italy;</HI> for he was Master
of no one Place in the Country, that could have
held out a formal Seige of fifteen Days open
Trenches, and he knew all this very well, and
therefore it seems, while the Duke of <HI>Vendosme,</HI>
resolv'd if possible to bring him to a Bat∣tle,
and to that End, made Dispositions to at∣tack
<HI>Luzara;</HI> we were surpriz'd to find the 15th
of <HI>June,</HI> 1702, the whole Imperial Army ap∣pear'd
in Batalia, and in full March to attack
us.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284"/>
AS it happen'd, our Army was all marching in
Columns towards them, as we had done for two
Days before, and I should have told you, that
three Days before, the Duke having Notice that
General <HI>Visconti,</HI> with three Imperial Regiments
of Horse, and one of Dragoons, was postedat <HI>San-Victoria,</HI>
on the <HI>Tessona;</HI> he resolv'd to attack
them, and this Design was carried so secretly that
while Monsieur <HI>Visconti,</HI> tho' our Army was three
Leagues another way, passing towards the <HI>Mode∣nese,</HI>
he found himself unexpedctely attack'd by
6000 Horse, and Dragoons of the <HI>French</HI> Army: He
defended himself very Bravely, for near an Hour;
when being over pour'd, and finding he should
be forc'd into Disorder, he founded a Retreat, but
the Squadrons had not fac'd about to make their
Retreat scarce a Quarter of an Hour, when they
found themselves surrounded with a great Body
of Infantry, who had entirely cut off their Re∣treat,
except over the Bridge of <HI>Tassona,</HI> which
being throng'd with their Baggage, they could
neither get backward or forward; so they Thrust
and tumbl'd over one another, in such a
manner, that they could preserve no kind of
Order; but abundance fell into the River, and
were drowned, many were kill'd, and more ta∣ken
Prisoners, so that in a Word the whole three
Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, were
entirely Defeated.</P>
<P>THIS was a great Blow to the Prince, because
they were some of the choicest Troops of his
whole Army: We took about 400 Prisoners, and
all their Baggage, which was a very considerable
Booty, and about 800 Horses; and no doubt these
Troops were very much wanted in the Battle that
insued on the 15th; as I have said: Our Army be∣ing
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
in full March, as <HI>above,</HI> to attack <HI>Luzara,</HI> a
Party of the <HI>Germans</HI> appear'd, being about 600
Horse, and in less than an Hour more, their whole
Army in order of Battle.</P>
<P>OUR Army form'd immediately, and the Duke
posted the Regiments as they came up, so much
to their Advantage, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was oblig'd
to alter his Dispositions, and had this particular
Inconvenience upon his Hands, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to attack
an Army superior to his own, in all their most
advantagious Posts; whereas had he thought fit
to have waited but one Day, we should have met
him half way; but this was owing to the Pride
of the <HI>German</HI> Generals, and their being so Opi∣niated
of the goodness of their Troops: The Royal
Army was Posted with the Left to the great River
<HI>Po,</HI> on the other Side of which the Prince of <HI>Vau∣demonts</HI>'s
Army lay, Canonading of the intrench∣ments
which the Imperialists had made at <HI>Borgo-Fort,</HI>
and hearing that there was like to be a ge∣neral
Battle, he detach'd 12 Battalions, and a∣bout
1000 Horse to Reinforce the Royal Army;
all which to our great Encouragement had time to
joyn the Army, while Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was making
his new Dispositions for the attack; and yet it
was the coming of these Troops which caus'd
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to resolve to begin the Fight, ex∣pecting
to have come to an Action before they
cou'd come up, but he was disappointed in the
Reason of Fighting, and yet was oblig'd to Fight
too, which was an Error in the Prince, that it
was too late to retrieve.</P>
<P>IT was five a-Clock in the Evening before he
could bring up his whole Line to Engage, and
then after having Canonaded us to no great pur∣pose
half an Hour, his Right commanded by the
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
Prince <HI>de Comercy,</HI> attack'd our Left Wing with
great Fury: Our Meu receiv'd them so well, and
seconded one another so punctually, that they
were Repulsed with a very great Slaughter, and
the Prince <HI>Comercy,</HI> being (unhappily for them)
kill'd in the first Onset, the Regiments for want
of Orders, and surpris'd with the fall of so great
a Man, were push'd into disorder, and one whole
Brigade was entirely broke.</P>
<P>BUT their second Line advancing under Gene∣ral
<HI>Herbeville,</HI> restor'd things, in the first; the Bat∣talions
rallyed, and they came boldly on to
Charge a second time, and being Seconded, with
new Reinforcements from their main Body, our
Men had their Turn, and were push'd to a Canal,
which lay on their left Flank, between them and
the <HI>Po,</HI> behind which they rally'd, and being
supported by new Troops, as well Horse as Foot;
they fought on both Sides, with the utmost obsti∣nacy,
and with such Courage and Skill, that it
was not possible to judge who should have had
the better, could they have been able to have
fought it out.</P>
<P>ON the Right of the Royal Army, was Posted,
the Flower of the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry; Namely, the
<HI>Gens de Arms,</HI> the Royal Carabineers, and the
Queen's Horse-Guards, with 400 Horse more, and
next them the Infantry, among which were our
Brigade; the Horse advanc'd first to Charge
and they carried all before them Sword
in Hand, receiving the Fire of two Imperial
Regiments of Curiassers, without firing a Shot,
and falling in among them, bore them down by
the strength of their Horses, putting them into
Confusion, and left so clear a Field for us to
follow, that the first Line of our Infantry stood
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
drawn up upon the Ground, which the Enemy
at first possest.</P>
<P>IN this first attack the Marquiss <HI>de Crequi,</HI> who
Commanded the whole Right Wing, was kil∣led;
a Loss, which fully ballanc'd the Death of
the Prince <HI>de Commercy,</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Ger∣mans;</HI>
after we had thus pushed the Enemies Ca∣valry,
<HI>as above,</HI> their Troops, being rally'd by
the Dexterity of their Generals, and supported
by three Imperial Regiments of Foot, they came
on again to the Charge with such Fury, that no∣thing
could withstand them; and here two Batta∣lions
of our <HI>Irish</HI> Regiments were put into Disorer,
and abundance of our Men kill'd, and here also I
had the Misfortune to receive a Musquet shot,
which broke my left Arm, and, that was not all,
for I was knock'd down by a Gyant like a <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Soldier, who when he thought he had kill'd
me, set his Foot upon me, but was immediately
shot dead by one of my Men, and fell just up∣on
me, which, my Arm being broken, was a ve∣ry
great mischief to me, for the very weight of
the Fellow, who was almost as big as a Horse,
was such, that I was not able to stir.</P>
<P>OUR Men were beaten back after this, from
the Place where they stood, and so I was left in
Possession of the Enemy, but was not their Pri∣soner,
(<HI>that is to say,</HI> was not found) till next
Morning, when a Party being sent, as usual with
Surgeons to look after the wounded Men, among
the Dead, found me almost smothered with the
dead <HI>Germans,</HI> and others that lay near me; how∣ever,
to do them justice, they us'd me with hu∣manity,
and the Surgeons set my Arm very Skil∣fully,
and well; and after four or five Days I
had liberty to go to <HI>Parma</HI> upon my Parole.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="288"/>
BOTH the Armies continued fighting, espe∣cially
on our Left, till it was so dark, that it was
impossible to know, who they fir'd at, or for the
Generals to see what they did; so they abated
firing Gradually, and as it may be truly said,
the Night parted them.</P>
<P>BOTH Sides claim'd the Victory, and both con∣ceal'd
their Losses, as much as was possible, but
'tis certain that never Battle was fought with
greater Bravery, and Obstinacy than this was, and
had there been Day light to have fought it cut,
doubtless there would have been many Thousand
Men more kill'd on both Sides.</P>
<P>ALL the <HI>Germans</HI> had to entitle them to the
Victory was, that they made our Left retire, as
I have said to the Canal, and to the high Banks,
or Mounds on the edge of the <HI>Po;</HI> but they had
so much Advantage in the Retreat, that they fir'd
from thence among the thickest of the Enemy,
and cou'd never be forc'd from their Posts.</P>
<P>THE best Testimony the Royal Army had
of the Victory, and which was certainly the bet∣ter
of the two, was, that two Days after the Fight,
they attack'd <HI>Guastalla,</HI> as it were in View of the
<HI>German</HI> Army, and forc'd the Garrison to sur∣render,
and to swear not to Serve again for six
Months, which they being 1500 Men, was a great
Loss to the <HI>Germans,</HI> and yet Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> did
not offer to Relieve it; and after that we took
several other Posts, which the Imperialists had
Possession of, but were oblig'd to Quit them up∣on
the approach of the <HI>French</HI> Army, not being
in Condition to Fight another Battle that Year.</P>
<P>MY Campaign was now at an End, and tho'
I came Lame off, I came off much better than
abundance of Gentlemen, for in that bloody Bat∣tle
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
we had above 400 Officers kill'd or wounded,
whereof three were General Officers.</P>
<P>THE Campaign held on till <HI>December,</HI> and
the Duke <HI>de Vendomse</HI> took <HI>Borgo Fort,</HI> and se∣veral
other Places from the <HI>Germans,</HI> who in
short, lost Ground every Day in <HI>Italy,</HI> I was a
Prisoner a great while, and there being no Car∣tel
settled, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> order'd the <HI>French</HI> Pri∣soners
to be sent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> which was a Cruel∣ty
that could not be reasonably exercised on
them; however, a great many by that Banishment,
found means to make their Escape to the <HI>Turks,</HI>
by whom they were kindly receiv'd, and the
<HI>French</HI> Ambassador at <HI>Constantinople</HI> took care of
them, and Shipp'd them back again into <HI>Italy</HI> at
the King's Charge.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke <HI>de Vendomse</HI> now took so many
<HI>Germans</HI> Prisoners, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was try'd of
sending his Prisoners to <HI>Hungary,</HI> and was oblig'd
to be at the Charge of bringing some of them
back again, who he had sent thither, and come
to agree to a general Exchange of Prisoners.</P>
<P>I was, as I have said, allow'd for a time to go to
<HI>Parma,</HI> upon my Parole, where I continu'd for the
recovery of my Wound, and broken Arm, forty
Days, and was then oblig'd to render my self to
the Commanding Officer at <HI>Ferrara,</HI> where Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> coming soon after, I was with several o∣ther
Prisoners of War, sent away into the <HI>Mila∣nese</HI>
to be kept for an Exchange of Prisoners.</P>
<P>IT was in the City of <HI>Trent,</HI> that I continu'd
about eight Months, the Man in whose House I
Quartered, was exceeding Civil to me, and took a
great deal of care of me, and I liv'd very easie;
here I contracted a kind of Familiarity, perfect∣ly
unde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gn'd by me, with the Daughter of the
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
Burgher at whose House I had Lodg'd, and I know
not, by what fatallity that was upon me, I was
prevail'd with afterward to Marry her: This was a
peice of Honesty on my Side, which I must ac∣knowledge,
I never intended to be guilty of; but
the Girl was too cunning for me; for she found
means to get some Wine into my Head more than
I us'd to drink, and tho' I was not so disorder'd
with it, but that I knew very well what I did,
yet in an unusual height of good Humour, I con∣sented
to be Married. This impolitick piece of
Honesty put me to many Inconveniences, for I
knew not what to do with this new Clog, which
I had loaded myself with, I could neither stay
with her, or take her with me, so that I was ex∣ceedingly
perplex'd.</P>
<P>THE time came soon after that I was releas'd
by the <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tel,</HI> and so was oblig'd to go to the Re∣giment,
which then was in Quarters in the <HI>Mi∣lanese,</HI>
and from thence, I got leave to go to <HI>Paris</HI>
upon my Promise to raise some Recruits in <HI>England</HI>
for the <HI>Irish</HI> Regiments, by the help of my Corre∣spondence
there; having thus leave to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> I
took a Passport from the Enemy's Army, to go to
<HI>Trent,</HI> and making a long Circuit, I went back thi∣ther,
and very honestly pack'd up my Baggage,
Wife, and all, and brought her away thro' <HI>Tyrot,</HI>
into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and so thro' <HI>Suabia,</HI> and the black
Forest into <HI>Alsatia</HI> from thence, I came into <HI>Lou∣rain,</HI>
and so to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I HAD now a secret Design to quit the War,
for I really had enough of sighting; but it was
counted so Dishonouable a Thing to quit, while
the Army was in the Field, that I could not Dis∣pense
with it, but an intervening Accident made
that Part easie to me: The War was now renew∣ed
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
between <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> just
as it was before; and the <HI>French</HI> King meditate∣ing
nothing more than how to give the <HI>English</HI> a
Diversion, fitted out a strong Squadron of Men
of War, and Frigates at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on Board of
which he embark'd a Body of Troops, of about
6500 Men, besides Voluntiers, and the new King,
as we call'd him, tho' more generally he was cal∣led,
the Chevalier <HI>de</HI> St. <HI>George</HI> was Shipp'd a∣long
with them, and all for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I pretended a great deal of Zeal for this Ser∣vice,
and that if I might be permitted to sell my
Company in the <HI>Irish</HI> Regiment I was in, and
have the <HI>Chevalier's</HI> Brevet for a Colonel, in Case
of raising Troops for him in <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
after his arrival, I would embark Voluntier,
and Serve at my own Expence; the latter
gave me a great advantage with the <HI>Chevalier;</HI>
for now I was esteem'd as a Man of Considera∣tion,
and one that must have a considerable In∣terest
in my own Country; so I obtain'd leave
to sell my Company, and having had a good
round Sum of Money remitted me from <HI>London,</HI>
by the way of <HI>Holland,</HI> I prepar'd a very hand∣some
Equipage, and away I went to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
embark.</P>
<P>I WAS very well receiv'd by the <HI>Chevalier,</HI>
and as he had an Account that I was an Officer
in the <HI>Irish</HI> Brigade, and had serv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
consequently was an old Soldier; all this added
to the Character which I had before, and made
me have a great deal of Honour paid me, tho'
at the same time I had no particular attachment
to his Person, or to his Cause, nor indeed did I
much consider the Cause, of one Side or other,
if I had, I should hardly have risqu'd not my
Life only, but Effects too, which were all as I
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
might say, from that Moment forfeited to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Government and was too evidently in their
Power to confiscate at their Pleasure.</P>
<P>HOWEVER having just receiv'd a Remittance
from <HI>London,</HI> of 300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and sold my
Company in the <HI>Irish</HI> Regiment for very near as
much, I was not only insensibly drawn in, but was
perfectly Voluntier in that dull Cause, and away
I went with them at all hazards; it belongs very
little to my History to give an Account of that
fruitless Expedition, only to tell you that being
so closely, and effectually Chas'd by the <HI>English</HI>
Fleet, which was Superior in force to the <HI>French,</HI>
I may say, that in escaping them, I escaped be∣ing
hang'd.</P>
<P>IT was the good Fortune of the <HI>French,</HI> that
they over-shot the Port they aim'd at, and in∣tending
for the <HI>Frith</HI> or <HI>Forth,</HI> or as it is call'd
the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburg,</HI> the first Land they made
was as far North as a Place call'd <HI>Montrose,</HI> where
it was not their Business to Land, and so they
were oblig'd to come back to the <HI>Frith,</HI> and were
gotten to the Enterance of it, and came to an
Anchor for the Tide; but this Delay or Hinder∣ance
gave time to the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, under Sir <HI>George
Ping</HI> to come up to the <HI>Frith,</HI> and they came
to an Anchor, just as we did, only waiting to go
up the <HI>Firth</HI> with the Flood.</P>
<P>HAD we not over-shot the Port, as above, all our
Squadron had been destroy'd in two Days, and all
we could have done, had been to have gotten in∣to
the <HI>Peer</HI> or <HI>Haven</HI> at <HI>Leith,</HI> with the smaller
Fregates, and have Landed the Troops and Am∣munition,
but we must have set fire to the Men
of War, for the <HI>English</HI> Squadron was not above
24 Hours behind us, or thereabout.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="293"/>
UPON this surprize the <HI>French</HI> Admiral set
Sail from the North Point of the <HI>Firth,</HI> where
we lay, and crowding away to the North, got
the Start of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and made their
escape, with the Loss of one Ship only, which
being behind the rest, could not get away; when
we were satisfy'd the <HI>English</HI> left Chasing us,
which was not till the third Night, when we al∣ter'd
our Course, and lost Sight of them, we stood
over to the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> and keeping that
Shore on Board all the way to the Mouth of the
<HI>Baltick,</HI> we came to an Anchor again, and sent
two Scouts Abroad to learn News, to see if the Sea
was clear, and being satisfy'd that the Enemy
did not Chase us, we kept on with an easier Sail,
and came all back again to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and glad I
was to set my Foot on Shore again, for all the
while we were thus fiying for our Lives, I was
under the greatest Terror immaginable, and no∣thing
but Halters and Gibbets run in my Head,
concluding, that if I had been taken, I should
certainly have been hang'd.</P>
<P>BUT the care was now over, I took my leave
of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and of the Army, and made
hast to <HI>Paris,</HI> I came so unexpectedly to <HI>Paris,</HI> and
to my own Lodgings that it was my Misfortune to
make a Discovery, relating to my Wife, which
was not at all to my satisfaction, for I found her
Ladyship had kept some Company, that I had
Reason to believe were not such as an honest Wo∣man
ought to have Convers'd with, and as I knew
her Temper, by what I had found of her myself,
I grew very Jealous and Uneasie about her; I
must own it touch'd me very nearly, for I be∣gan
to have an extraordinary value for her, and
her Behaviour was very taking, especially after
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
I had brought her into <HI>France;</HI> but having a Vein
of Levity, it was impossible to prevent her run∣ing
into such things, in a Town, so full of what
they call Gallantry as <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>IT vext me also to think that it should be my
Fate to be a Cuckold, both Abroad and at Home,
and sometimes I would be in such a Rage about
it, that I had no Government of myself, when I
thought of it; whole Days, and I may say some∣times
whole Nights I spent musing and consider∣ing
what I should do to her, and especially what
I should do to the Villain, wherever he was that
had thus abus'd and suplanted me: Here indeed
I committed Murther more than once, or indeed
than a hundred times, in my imagination, and as
the Devil is certainly an apparent Prompter to
wickedness, if he is not the first Mover of it in
our Minds; he teiz'd me Night and Day with
Proposals to kill my Wife.</P>
<P>THIS horrid Project he carried up so high,
by raising fierce Thoughts, and fomenting the
Blood upon my Contemplation of the word
Cuckold, that in short, I left debating whether I
should Murther her or no, as a thing out of the Que∣stion,
and Determined; and my Thoughts were
then taken up only with the Management how I
should kill her, and how to make my escape after
I had done it.</P>
<P>ALL this while I had no sufficient Evidence of
her Guilt, neither had I so much as charg'd her
with it, or let her know I suspected her, other∣wise,
than as she might perceive it in my Con∣duct,
and in the Change of my Behaviour to her,
which was such, that the could not but perceive
that something troubled me, yet she took no no∣tice
of it to me, but receiv'd me very well, and
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>
shew'd herself to be very glad of my return;
nor did I find she had been Extravagant in her
Expences while I was Abroad; but Jealousie, as
the wise Man says, <HI>is the wrath of a Man;</HI> her be∣ing
so good a Hussy of what Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y I had left
her, gave my distemper'd Fancy an Opinion that
she had been maintain'd by other People, and so
had had no Occasion'd to spend.</P>
<P>I must confess she had a difficult Point here
upon her, tho' she had been really honest; for as
my Head was prepossess'd of her dishonesty; if
she had been Lavish, I should have said, she had
spent it upon her Gentlemen; and as she had been
Frugal, I said, she had been Maintain'd by them:
Thus, <HI>I say,</HI> my Head was Distemper'd, I be∣liev'd
myself Abus'd, and nothing could put it
out of my Thoughts Night or Day.</P>
<P>ALL this while, it was not visibly broken out
between us, but I was so fully possess'd with the
belief of it, that I seem'd to want no Evi∣dence,
and I look'd with an evil Eye upon every
Body that came near her, or that she Con∣vers'd
with: There was an Officer of the <HI>Guards
du Corps</HI> that lodg'd in the same House with us, a
very honest Gentleman, and a Man of Quality; I
happen'd to be in a little Drawing-Room, adjoyn∣ing
to a Parlour where my Wife sat at that time,
and this Gentleman came into the Parlour, which
as he was one of the Family, he might have
done without Offence, but he not knowing that
I was in the drawing-Room, sat down and talk'd
with my Wife; I heard every word they said, for
the Door between us was open, nor could I say
that there pass'd any thing between them, but cur∣sory
Discourse; they talk'd of casual things, of a
young Lady a Burgher's Daughter of 19, that had
<PB N="290" REF="296"/>
been Married the Week before to an Advocate
in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> vastly Rich, and a∣bout
63, and of another, a Widow Lady of Fortune
in <HI>Paris,</HI> that had married her deceas'd Husbands
Valet de Chamber, and of such casual Matters,
that I could find no Fault with now at all.</P>
<P>BUT it fill'd my Head with jealous Thoughts,
and fir'd my Temper: Now I fancy'd he us'd too
much freedom with her, then that she us'd too
much freedom to him, and once or twice I was
upon the Point of breaking in upon them, and
Affronting them both, but I restrain'd myself; at
length he talk'd something merrily of the Lady
throwing away her Maidenhead, as I understood
it, upon an old Man; but still it was nothing in∣decent,
but I, who was all on fire already could
bear it no longer, but started up, and came into
the Room, and catching at my Wive's words, <HI>say
you so,</HI> Madam, said I, <HI>was he too old for her!</HI> and
giving the Officer a look, that I Fancy was some∣thing
a Kin to the Face on the Sign, call'd the
<HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> within <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> I went out in∣to
the Street.</P>
<P>THE Marquiss, so he was stil'd, a Man of
Honour, and of Spirit too, took it, <HI>as I meant it,</HI>
and follow'd me in a Moment, and Hem'd after
me in the Street; upon which I stopp'd, and he
came up too me, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> our Circumstances
are very unhappy in <HI>France,</HI> that we cannot do
ourselves Justice here, without the most severe
Treatment in the World; but come on it what will,
you must explain yourself to me on the Subject
of your Behaviour just now.</P>
<P>I WAS a little cool'd, as to the Point of my
Conduct to him in the very few Moments that
had pass'd, and was very sensible, that I was
wrong to him, and, <HI>I said,</HI> therefore to him very
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
frankly, Sir, you are a Gentleman, who I know
very well, and I have a very great respect for you;
but I had been disturb'd a little about the Conduct
of my Wife, and were it your own Case, What
would you have done less?</P>
<P>I AM sorry for any dislike between you, and
your Wife, <HI>says he,</HI> But what is that to me? Can
you Charge me with any Indecency to her, except
my talking so, and so, at which he repeated the
Words, and as I knew you were in next Room,
and heard every Word, and that all the Doors
were open, I thought no Man could have taken
amiss, so Innocent an Expression.</P>
<P>I could no otherwise take it amiss, <HI>said I,</HI> than
as I thought it imply'd a farther Familiarity,
and that you cannot expect should be born by
any Man of Honour; however, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> I spoke
only to my Wife, I said nothing to you, but gave
you my Hat as I pass'd you.</P>
<P>YES, <HI>said he,</HI> and a look as full of Rage as
the Devil, Are there no Words in such looks?</P>
<P>I CAN say nothing to that, <HI>said I,</HI> for I can∣not
see my own Countenance; but my Rage as
you call it was at my Wife, not at you.</P>
<P>BUT hark you Sir, <HI>said he, growing warm as I
grow Calm,</HI> your anger at your Wife, was for her
Discourse with me, and I think that concerns me
too, and I ought to Resent it.</P>
<P>I think not, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> nor had I found you in Bed
with my Wife, would I have Quarreled with you;
for if my Wife will let you lye with her, 'tis she
is the Offender, what have I do with you; you
could not lye with her if she was not willing,
and if she is willing to be a Whore I ought to
punish her, but I should have no quarrel with
you, I'll lye with your Wife if I can, and then
I am even with you.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="298"/>
I spoke this all in good Humour, and in order
to pacify him, but it would not do; but he would
have me have give him satisfaction, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI>
I told him I was a Stranger in the Country, and
perhaps should find little Mercy in their Course
of Justice; that it was not my Business to fight
any Man in his Vindicating his keeping Compa∣ny
with my Wife, for that the Injury was mine,
in having a bad Woman to deal with, that there
was no Reason in the thing; that after any Man
should have found the way into my Bed, I, who
am injur'd should go, and Stake my Life upon
an equal Hazard against the Men who have a∣bus'd
me.</P>
<P>NOTHING would prevail with this Person
to be quiet, for all this; but I had affronted
him, and no satisfaction could be made him,
but that at the Point of the Sword, so we agreed
to go away together to <HI>Lisle</HI> in <HI>Flanders:</HI> I was
now Soldier enough, not to be afraid to look a
a Man in the Face, and as the Rage at my Wife
inspir'd me with Courage; so he let fall a Word
that fir'd, and provok'd me beyond all Patience;
for speaking of the distrust I had of my Wife, he
said unless I had good Information, I ought not
to suspect my Wife; I told him, if I had good
Information, I should be past Suspicion; he re∣plyed,
if he was the happy Man that had so
much of her Favour, he would take care then to
put me past the Suspicion, I gave him as
rough an Answer, as he could desire, and he re∣turn'd
in <HI>French, nous Verrons aux Lisle,</HI> that is to
say, we will talk further of it at <HI>Lisle.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I did not see the benefit, either
to him, or me, of going so far as <HI>Lisle</HI> to decide
this Quarrel, since now I perceiv'd he was the
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
Man I wanted, that we might decide this Quarrel
<HI>aux Champ,</HI> upon the Spot, and whoever had
the Fortune to fell the other, might make
his escape to <HI>Lisle,</HI> as well afterwards, as before.</P>
<P>THUS we walk'd on, talking very ill natured∣ly
on both Sides, and yet very mannerly, till we
came clear of the <HI>Subarbs</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> on the way to
<HI>Charenton;</HI> when seeing the way clear, I told
him under those Trees was a very fit Place for
us, pointing to a row of Trees adjoyning to
Monsieur—<HI>s</HI> Garden-wall; so we went thi∣ther,
and fell to Work immediately, after some
Fencing he made a home, Thrust at me, and run
me into my Arm, a long slanting Wound, but at
the same time receiv'd my Point into his Body,
and soon after fell; he spoke some Words before
he drop'd; first he told me I had kill'd him, then
he said, he had indeed wrong'd me, and as he
knew it, he ought not to have fought me; he desir'd
I would make my Escape immediately, which
I did into the City, but no farther, no body, as
I thought having seen us together: In the Af∣ternoon,
about six Hours after the Action, Mes∣sengers
brought News one on the Heels of another,
that the Marquiss was mortally wounded, and
carried into a House at <HI>Charenton;</HI> that account,
saying he was not dead, surpris'd me a little, not
doubting, but that concluding I had made my
Escape, he would own who it was; however, I
discover'd nothing of my Concern, but going up
into my Chamber, I took out of a Cabinet there
what Money I had, which indeed was so much as
I thought would be sufficient for my Expences;
but having an accepted Bill for 2000 Livers, I
walk'd sedately to a Merchant who knew me, and
got 50 Pistols of him upon my Bill, letting him
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
know my Business call'd me to <HI>England,</HI> and I
would take the rest of him when he had re∣ceiv'd
it.</P>
<P>HAVING furnish'd myself thus, I provided me
a Horse for my Servant, for I had one very good
one of my own, and once more ventured Home
to my Lodging, where I heard again that the
Marquiss was not dead: My Wife all this while
cover'd her Concern for the Marquiss so well,
that she gave me no room to make any remark
upon her; but she saw evidently the Marks of
Rage, and deep Resentment in my Behaviour af∣ter
some little stay, and perceiving me mak∣ing
Preparations for a Journey; she said to
me, Are you going out of Town? yes Madam,
<HI>says I,</HI> that you may have room to Mourn for
your Friend, the Marquiss; at which she started,
and shew'd she was indeed in a most terrible
Fright: And making a thousand Crosses about
herself, and with a great many callings upon the
<HI>Blessed Virgin,</HI> and her Country <HI>Saints,</HI> she burst
out at last, is it <HI>possible!</HI> Are you the Man that
has kill'd the Marquiss? then you are undone,
and I too.</P>
<P>YOU may, Madam, be a loser by the Mar∣quiss
being kill'd, but I'll take care to be as lit∣tle
a looser by you as I can; 'tis enough, the Mar∣quiss
has honestly confest your Guilt, and I have
done with you; she would have thrown her∣self
into my Arms, protesting her Innocence, and
told me she would flye with me, and would Con∣vince
me of her Fidelity, by such Testimonies
as I cou'd not but be satisfy'd with, but I thrust
her violently from me, <HI>alle Infame!</HI> said I, go in∣famous
Creature, and take from me the Necessity
I should be under, if I stay'd of sending you to
<PB N="295" REF="301"/>
keep Company with your dear Friend the Mar∣quiss.
I thrust her away with such Force that she
fell backward upon the Floor, and cry'd out
most terribly, and indeed she had Reason, for
she was very much hurt.</P>
<P>IT griev'd me indeed to have thrust her away
with such Force, but you must consider me now in
the Circumstances of a Man enrag'd, and as it
were out of himself Furious and Mad: However, I
took her up from the Floor, and laid her on the Bed,
and calling up her Maid, bad her go and take care
of her Mistress; and going soon after out of Doors,
I took Horse, and made the best of my way, not
towards <HI>Calais</HI> or <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or towards <HI>Flanders,</HI>
whether it might be suggested I was fled, and
whether they did pursue me, the same Evening;
but I took the direct Road for <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and rid∣ing
all Night and very hard, I pass'd the <HI>Main</HI>
the next Day at Night at <HI>Chalons,</HI> and came
safe into the Duke of <HI>Lorrain's</HI> Dominions the
third Day; where I rested one Day, only to con∣sider
what Course to take, for it was still a
most difficult thing to pass any way, but that
I should either be in the King of <HI>France's</HI> Domi∣nions,
or be taken by the <HI>French</HI> Allies as a Subject
of <HI>France;</HI> but getting good Advice from a Priest
at <HI>Bar le Due,</HI> who tho' I did not tell him the parti∣culars
of my Case, yet guess'd how it was, it being
as he said very usual for Gentlemen in my Cir∣cumstances
to fly that way, upon this Supposition,
this kind <HI>Padre</HI> got me a Church Pass, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
he made me a Purveyor for the Abbey of—
and as such got me a Passport to go to <HI>Deux
Ponts,</HI> which belong'd to the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI>
Having such Authority there, and the Priest's
recommendation to an Ecclesiastick in the Place, I
<PB N="296" REF="302"/>
got Passports from thence in the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI>
Name to <HI>Cologne,</HI> and then I was thoroughly safe, so
making my way to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> without any
difficulty, I came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and from thence,
tho' very privately, and by several Names, I
came to <HI>England:</HI> And thus I got clear of my
<HI>Italian</HI> Wife, Whore I should have call'd her, for
after I had made her so my self, how should I ex∣pect
any other of her.</P>
<P>BEING arriv'd at <HI>London,</HI> I wrote to my
Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> but dated my Letter from the
<HI>Hague,</HI> where I order'd him to Direct his An∣swers:
The chief Business of my writing was to
know if my Bill was paid him, to enquire if any
pursuit was made after me, and what other News
he had about me, or my Wife, and particular∣ly
how it had far'd with the Marquiss.</P>
<P>I receiv'd an Answer in a few Days, import∣ing
that he had receiv'd the Money on my Bill,
which he was ready to pay as I should direct,
that the Marquiss was not dead, but said he,
you have kill'd him another way, for he has lost
his Commission in the Guards, which was worth to
him 20000 Livres, and he is yet a close Prisoner
in the <HI>Bastile;</HI> that pursuit was order'd after me
upon suspision, that they had follow'd me to <HI>A∣miens,</HI>
on the Road to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and to <HI>Chastean de
Cambresis,</HI> on the way to <HI>Flanders;</HI> but misling me
that way, had given it over; that the Marquiss had
been too well instructed to own that he had fought
with me, but said, that he was assaulted on the Road,
and unless I could be taken, he would take his Trial,
and come off, for want of Proof, that my flying
was a Circumstance indeed, that mov'd strong∣ly
against him, because it was known that we
had had some Words that Day, and were seen
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
to walk together; but that nothing being prov'd
on either Side, he would come off with the Loss
of his Commission; which, however, being very
Rich, he could bear well enough.</P>
<P>AS to my Wife, he wrote me Word, she was
inconsolable, and had cry'd her self to Death
almost; but, <HI>he added,</HI> (very ill natur'd indeed)
and whether it was for me, or for the Marquiss,
that he could not determine: <HI>He likewise told me,</HI>
She was in very bad Circumstances, and very
low, So that if I did not take some Care of her,
she would come to be in very great Distress.</P>
<P>THE latter Part of this Story mov'd me
indeed, for, I thought however it was, I ought
not to let her Starve; and besides, Poverty was a
Temptation which a Woman could not easily
withstand, and I ought not to be the Instrument
to drive her to a horrid Necessity of Crime, if I
could prevent it.</P>
<P>UPON this, I wrote to him again, to go to
her, and talk with her, and learn as much as he
could of her particular Circumstances; and that
if he found she was really in Want, and par∣ticularly,
that she did not live a scandalous Life,
he should give her twenty Pistoles, and tell her,
if she would engage to live retir'd and honestly,
she should have so much annually, which was
enough to subsit her.</P>
<P>SHE took the first twenty Pistoles, but bad
him tell me, that I had wrong'd her, and unjust∣ly
charg'd her; and I ought to do her Justice;
and I had ruin'd her, by expossing her in such a
Manner as I had, having no Proof of my Charge,
or Ground for any Suspicion; that as to twenty
Pistoles a Year, it was a mean Allowance, to a
Wife that had travelled over the World, as she
<PB N="298" REF="304"/>
had done with me, and the like; and so expostu∣lated
with him, to obtain forty Pistoles a Year
of me, which I consented to; but she never gave
me the Trouble of paying above one Year; for
after that, the Marquiss was so found of her again,
that he took her away to himself; and as my
Friend wrote me Word, had settled 400 Crowns
a Year on her, and I never heard any more
of her.</P>
<P>I was now in <HI>London,</HI> but was oblig'd to be ve∣ry
retir'd, and change my Name, letting no Body
in the Nation know who I was, except my Mer∣chant,
by whom I corresponded with my People
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and particularly that my Tutor,
who was now become the head Mannager of my
Affairs, and was in very good Circumstances
himself also by my Means; but he deserved all
I did, or could do for him; for he was a most
faithful Friend, as well as Servant, as ever Man
had, in that Country at least.</P>
<P>I was not the easiest Man alive, in the retir'd
sollitary manner I now liv'd in; and I experi∣enced
the Truth of the Text, <HI>That it is not good
for Man to be alone;</HI> for I was extreamly Melan∣cholly
and Heavy, and indeed, knew not what
to do with my self; particularly, because I was
under some Restraint; that I was to afraid to go
Abroad; at last I resolv'd to go quite away, and
go to <HI>Virginia</HI> again, and there live retired as I
could.</P>
<P>BUT when I came to consider that Part, more
narrowly, I could not prevail with my self to live
a private Life: I had got a wandring kind of
Taste, and Knowledge of Things, begat a Desire
of encreasing it, and an exceeding Delight I had
in it; tho' I had nothing to do in the Armies
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
or in the War, and did not design ever to meddle
with it again; yet I could not live in the World,
and not enquire what was doing in it; nor could
I think of living in <HI>Virginia,</HI> where I was to hear
my News twice a Year, and read the publick
Accounts, of what was just then upon the Stocks,
as the History of things past.</P>
<P>THIS, was my Notion, I was now in my
native Country, where my Circumstances were
easy; and tho' I had had ill Luck Abroad, for I
brought little Home with me; yet by little good
Mannagement, I might soon have Money by me.
I had no Body to keep but my self, and my Plan∣tations
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> generally return'd me from
400 to 600 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, one Year above 700 <HI>l.</HI> and
to go thither, I concluded, was to be bury'd
a-live; so I put off all Thoughts of it,
and resolv'd to settle somewhere in <HI>England,</HI>
where I might know every Body, and no Body
know me. I was not long in concluding where
to pitch, for as I spoke the <HI>French</HI> Tongue per∣fectly
well, having been so many Years among
them, it was easy for me to pass for a <HI>French</HI>
Man. So I went to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> call'd my self an
<HI>English</HI> Man, among the <HI>French;</HI> and a <HI>French</HI>
Man among the <HI>English;</HI> and on that Score,
was the more perfectly concealed, going by the
Name of Monsieur <HI>Charnot,</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI>
was call'd Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> among the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>HERE, indeed, I liv'd perfectly <HI>Incog.</HI> I made
no particular Acquaintance, so as to be intimate,
and yet I knew every Body, and every Body
knew me; I discours'd in Common, talk'd <HI>French</HI>
with the <HI>Walloons;</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> with the <HI>English;</HI>
and living retir'd and sober, was well enough re∣ceiv'd
by all Sorts; but as I medled with no
<PB N="300" REF="306"/>
Bodies business, so no Body meddl'd with mine;
I thought I liv'd pretty well.</P>
<P>BUT I was not fully satisfy'd, a settled
family Life was the thing I Lov'd had made
two pushes at it, as you have heard, but with ill
Success; yet the Miscarriage of what was pass'd did
not discourage me at all but I resolv'd to marry,
I look'd out for a Woman as suitable as I could,
but always found something or other to shock
my Fancy; except once a Gentleman's Daughter
of good Fashion, but I met with so many re∣pulses
of one kind or another, that I was forc'd
to give it over, and indeed tho' I might be said
to be a Lover in this Suit, and had mannag'd
myself so well with the young Lady, that I had
no difficulty lest, but what would soon have
been adjusted, yet her Father was so difficult,
made so many Objections, was to Day not pleas'd,
one way to Morrow another, that he would stand
by nothing that he himself had propos'd, nor
could he be ever be brought to be of the same
Mind two Days together; so that we at last put
an End to the Pretentions, for she would not Mar∣ry
without her Father's consent, and I would not
steal her, and so that Affair ended.</P>
<P>I cannot say, but I was a little vex'd at the
Disappointment of this, so I left the City of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> and went to <HI>London</HI> in the Stage-Coach;
here I had an odd Scene presented as e∣ver
happen'd of its kind.</P>
<P>THERE was in the Stage-Coach a young Wo∣man,
and her Maid, she was sitting in a very
melancholly Posture, for she was in the Coach
before me, and sigh'd most dreadfully all the
way, and whenever her Maid spoke to her, she
burst out into Tears; I was not long in the Coach
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
with her, but seeing she made such a dismal Fi∣gure,
I offer'd to Comfort her a little, and en∣quir'd
into the Occasion of her Affliction, but
she would not speak a Word; but her Maid with
a force of crying too, said her Master was dead,
at which Word the Lady burst out again into a
Passion of crying, and between Mistress and
Maid, this was all I could get for the Morn∣ing
part of that Day: When we came to Dine, I
offer'd the Lady, that seeing, I suppos'd she would
not Dine with the Company, if she would please
to Dine with me, I would Dine in a separate
Room, for the rest of the Company were Fo∣reigners:
Her Maid thank'd me in her Mistresses
Name, but her Mistress could eat nothing, and
desir'd to be private.</P>
<P>HERE however, I had some Discourse with the
Maid, by whom I learn'd that the Lady was
Wife to a Captain of a Ship, who was Outward
bound to somewhere in the <HI>Streights,</HI> I think it
was to <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that being gone no far∣ther
than the <HI>Downs;</HI> he was taken sick, and after
about ten days Illness had died at <HI>Deal,</HI> that his
Wife hearing of his Sickness, had gone to <HI>Deal</HI>
to see him, and had come but just time enough
to see him die, had stay'd there to bury him, and
was now coming to <HI>London,</HI> in a sad disconsolate
Condition indeed.</P>
<P>I heartily pitied the young Gentlewoman in∣deed,
and said some things to her in the Coach, to
let her know I did so, which she gave no answer
to, but in Civility, now and then made a Bow, but
never gave me the least Opportunity to see her
Face; or so much as to know whether she had a
Face, or no; much less to guess what Form of a
Face it was; it was Winter time, and the Coach
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
put up at <HI>Rochester;</HI> not going thro' in a Day, as
was usual in Summer; and a little before we came
to <HI>Rochester,</HI> I told the Lady I understood she
had eat nothing to Day, that such a Course
would but make her Sick, and doing her Harm,
could do her deceas'd. Husband no good, and
and therefore I entreated her, that as I was a
Stranger, and only offer'd a Civility to her in
Order to abate her severely afflicting herself,
she would yield so far to matters of Ceremony,
let us Sup together as Passengers, for as to the
Strangers they did not seem to understand the
Custom, or to desire it.</P>
<P>SHE bow'd, but gave no Answer, only after
pressing her by Arguments, which she could not
deny was very civil and kind; she return'd, that
she gave me thanks, but she could not eat; well,
Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> do but sit down, tho' you think you
cannot eat, perhaps you may eat a Bit; indeed
you must eat, or you will destroy yourself at
this rate of living, and upon the Road too: In a
Word, you will be Sick indeed; I argued with
her, the Maid put in, and said, do Madam, pray
try to divert yourself a little; I press'd her a∣gain,
and she bow'd to me very respectively, but
still said no, and she could not eat; the Maid
continu'd to importune her, and said, dear Ma∣dam
do, the Gentleman is a civil Gentleman,
pray Madam do, and then turning to me said,
my Mistress will Sir, I hope, and seem'd pleas'd,
and indeed was so.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I went on to perswade her, and
taking no Notice of what her Maid said, that I
was a civil Gentleman, I told her, I am a stranger
to you Madam; but if I thought you were shye of
me on any Account, as to civility, I will send my
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>
Supper up to you in your Chamber, and stay be∣low
myself; she bow'd then to me twice, and
look'd up, which was the first time, and said, she
had no Suspicion of that kind, that my offer was
so civil, that she was as much ashamed to refuse
it, as she should be asham'd to accept it, if she was
where she was known; that she thought I was not
quite a stranger to her, for she had seen me before;
that she would accept my offer, so far as to sit at
Table, because I desir'd it, but she could not promise
me to eat, and that she hop'd I would take the
other as a Constraint upon her, in return to so
much kindness.</P>
<P>SHE startled me, when she said she had seen
me before, for I had not the least knowledge of
her, nor did I remember so much as to have heard
of her Name; for I had ask'd her Name of her
Maid, and indeed it made me almost Repent my
Compliment; for it was many ways essential to
to me not to be known: However, I could
not go back, and besides, if I was known, it was
essentially necessary to me to know who it was
that knew me, and by what Circumstances; so I
went on with my Compliment.</P>
<P>WE came to the Inn, but just before it was
Dark, I offer'd to hand my Widow out of the
Coach, and she could not decline it, but tho' her
Hoods were not then much over her Face, yet
being dark, I could see little of her then, I
waited on her then to the Stair-foot, and led her
up the Inn Stairs to a Dining-room, which the
Master of the House offer'd to show us, as if for the
whole Company; but she declin'd going in there,
and said she, desir'd rather to go directly to her
Chamber, and turning to her Maid, bad her speak
to the Inn-Keeper to show her her Lodging-room;
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>
so I waited on her to the Door, and took my
leave telling her I would expect her at Supper.</P>
<P>IN order to Treat her moderately well, and
not extravagantly, for I had no thoughts of any
thing farther than Civility, which was the Effect
of meer Compassion, for the Unhappiness of the
most truly disconsolate Woman that I ever met
with: <HI>I say,</HI> in order to treat her handsome∣ly,
but not extravagantly, I provided what the
House afforded, which was a couple of Par∣taridges,
and a very good Dish of stew'd Oy∣sters;
they brought us up afterward, a Neats
Tongue and a Ham, that was almost cut quite
down, but we eat none of it, for the other was
fully enough for us both; and the Maid made
her Supper of the Oysters we had left, which
were enough.</P>
<P>I mention this, because it should appear, I did
not treat her as a Person I was making any Court
to, for I had nothing of that in my Thoughts; but
meerly in Pity to the poor Woman, who I saw
in a Circumstance that was indeed very un∣happy.</P>
<P>WHEN I gave her Maid Notice that Supper
was ready, she fetch'd her Mistress, coming in
before her, with a Candle in her Hand; and
then it was that I saw her Face, and being in
her <HI>Disabille,</HI> she had no Hoods over her Eyes,
or Black upon her Head, when I was truly sur∣prized,
to see one of the most beautiful Faces
upon Earth: I saluted her, and led her to the
Fire-side; the Table tho' spread being too far
from the Fire, the Weather being Cold.</P>
<P>SHE was now something Sociable, tho' very
grave, and sighing often, on Account of her
Circumstances; but she so handsomly govern'd
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
her Grief, yet so artfully made, it mingle it
self with all her Discourse, that it added ex∣ceedingly
to her Behaviour, which was every way
most exquisitely Genteel: I had a great deal of
Discourse with her, and upon many Subjects, and
by degrees took her Name; <HI>that is to say,</HI> from
her sself, as I had before from her Maid, also the
Place where she liv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> near <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> or ra∣ther
<HI>Stepney,</HI> where I ask'd her leave to pay her
a Visit, when she thought fit to admit Company,
which she seemed to intimate would not be a great
while.</P>
<P>IT is a Subject too surfeiting to entertain
People with the Beauty of a Person they will
never see; let it suffice to tell them she was the
most beautiful Creature of her Sex, that I ever
saw before, or since; and it cannot be wondered
if I was charm'd with her, the very first Moment I
see her Face: Her behaviour was likewise a Beau∣ty
in itself, and was so extraordinary, that I can∣not
say I can describe it.</P>
<P>THE next day she was much more free than
she was that first Night, and I had so much Con∣versation
as to enter into particulars of things on
both side, salso she gave me leave to come and see
her House, which however, I did not do under a
fortnight, or thereabouts, because I did not know
how far she would dispense with the Ceremony,
which it was necessary to keep up at the begin∣ning
of her Mourning.</P>
<P>HOWEVER I came as a Man that had Business
with her, relating to the Ship her Husband was
dead out of, and the first time I came was ad∣mitted;
and in short, the first time I came I made
Love to her; she receiv'd that Proposal with dis∣dain,
I cannot indeed say she treated me with a∣ny
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
disrespect; but she said, she abhorr'd the of∣fer,
and would hear no more of it.</P>
<P>HOW I came to make such a Proposal to her,
I scarce knew then, tho' it was very much my
Intention from the first.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I enquir'd into her Cir∣cumstances,
and her Character, and heard no∣thing
but what was very agreeable of them both;
and above all, I found she had the Report of the
best humoured Lady, and the best bred of all
that part of the Town; and now I thought I
had found what I had so often wish'd for, to
make me happy, and had twice miscarry'd in,
and resolv'd not to miss her, if it was possible to
obtain her.</P>
<P>IT came indeed, a little into my Thoughts,
that I was a marry'd Man, and had a second Wife
alive, who tho' she was false to me, and a Whore,
yet I was not legally divorc'd from her, and that
she was my Wife for all that; but I soon got
over that part; for first, as she was a Whore,
and the Marquiss had confess'd it to me, I was
divorc'd in Law, and I had Power to put her away;
but having had the Misfortune of fighting a Duel,
and being oblig'd to quit the Country, I could not
claim the legal Process, which was my Right,
and therefore might conclude my self as much
divorc'd, as if it had been actually done, and
so that Scruple vanish'd.</P>
<P>I suffer'd now two Months to run, without
pressing my Widow any more, only I had kept
a strict Watch to find if any one else pretend∣ed
to her; at the end of two Months I Visited her
again, when I found she receiv'd me with more
Freedom, and we had no more Sighs, and Sobbs
about the last Husband; and tho' she would not
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
let me press my former Proposal, so far as I
thought I might have done, yet I found I had leave
to come again, and it was the Article of Decency,
which she stood upon, as much as any thing, that I
was not disagreeable to her, and that my using
her so handsomely upon the Road, had given me a
great Advantage in her Favour.</P>
<P>I went on gradually with her, and gave her
leave to stand off for two Months more; but
then I told her the matter of Decency, which was
but a Ceremony, was not to stand in Competition
with the matter of Affection; and in short, I
could not bear any longer delay, but that if she
thought fit we might Marry privately, and to
cut the Story short, as I did my Courtship, in
about five Months I got her in the Mind, and
we were privately Married, and that with so
very exact a Concealment, that her Maid that was
so Instrumental in it, yet had no Knowledge of
it for near a Month more.</P>
<P>I was now not only in my Imagination, but in
reallity the most happy Creature in the World;
as I was so infinitely satisfy'd with my Wife, was
indeed the best humour'd Woman in the World, a
most accomplish'd beautiful Creature indeed, per∣fectly
well Bred, and had not one ill Quality a∣bout
her, and this happiness continu'd without
the least Interruption for about six Year.</P>
<P>BUT I, that was to be the most unhappy Fel∣low
alive in the Article of Matrimony, had at
last a Disappointment of the worst sort, even
here; I had three fine Children by her, and in her
time of her lying inn with the last, she got some
Cold, that she did not in a long time get off, and
in short she grew very sickly: In being so conti∣nually
ill, and out of Order, she very unhappily
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
got a Habit of drinking Cordials and hot Liquors;
Drink, like the Devil, when it gets hold of any
one, tho' but a little, it goes on by little and little
to their Destruction; so in my Wife, her Stomach
being weak and faint, she first took this Cordial,
then that, till in short, she could not live with∣out
them, and from a Drop to a Sup, from
a Sup to a Dram, from a Dram to a Glass, and
so on to Two, till at last, she took in short, to
what we call drinking.</P>
<P>AS I likened Drink to the Devil, in its gradu∣al
Possession of the Habits and Person, so it is yet
more like the Devil in its Encroachment on us,
where it gets hold of our Sences; in short, my
beautiful, good humour'd, modest, well bred
Wife, grew a Beast, a Slave to Strong Liquor, and
would be drunk at her own Table, nay, in her
own Closet by her self; till instead of a well
made, fine Shape, she was as Fat as an Hostess;
her fine Face bloated and blotch'd, had not so
much as the Ruins of the most beautiful Person
alive; nothing remain'd but a good Eye, that in∣deed,
she held to the last: In short, she lost her
Beauty, her Shape, her Manners, and at last her
Virtue; and giving her self up to Drinking, kill'd
her self in about a Year and a half, after she first
began that cursed Trade; in which Time she twice
was exposed in the most scandalous manner, with
a Captain of a Ship, who like a Villain, took the
Advantage of her being in Drink, and not know∣ing
what she did; but it had this unhappy Effect,
that instead of her being asham'd, and repenting
of it, when she came to her self; it harden'd her
in the Crime, and she grew as void of Modesty at
last as of Sobriety.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315"/>
O! The Power of Intemperance! and how it
Encroaches on the best Dispositions in the World;
how it comes upon us gradually and insensibly,
and what dismal Effects it Works upon our Mo∣rals,
changing the most Virtuous, regular, well
instructed, and well inclin'd Tempers, into worse
than Brutal. That was a good Story, whether
real or invented, of the Devil tempting a young
Man to murder his Father. No, <HI>he said,</HI> that was
un-natural. Why, then <HI>says the Devil,</HI> Go and
lye with your Mother: No, <HI>says he,</HI> That is abo∣minable.
Well, Then, <HI>says the Devil,</HI> If you
will do nothing else to oblige me, go and get
Drunk; Ay, ay, <HI>says the Fellow,</HI> I'll do that, so
he went and made himself Drunk as a Swine; and
when he was Drunk, he murdered his Father, and
lay with his Mother.</P>
<P>NEVER was a Woman more virtuous, modest,
chaste, sober, she never so much as desir'd to
drink any thing strong; it was with the greatest
entreaty, that I could prevail with her to drink
a Glass or two of Wine, and rarely, if ever, a∣bove
one, or two at a time; even in Company,
she had no Inclination to it; not an immodest
Word ever came out of her Mouth, nor would she
suffer it in any one else, in her Hearing without
Resentment and Abhorence: But upon that Weak∣ness,
and Illness after her last Lying-Inn; as above
the Nurse press'd her, when ever she found her self
faint, and a Sinking of her Spirits, to take this
Cordial and that Dram, to keep up her Spirits,
till it became necessary even to keep her a-live,
and gradually increased to a Habit, so that it was
no longer her Physick, but her Food; her Appe∣tite
sunk and went quite away, and she eat little
or nothing, but came at last to such a dreadful
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
Height, that, <HI>as I have said,</HI> she would be Drunk in
her own Dressing Room by Eleven a Clock in the
Morning; and in Short, at last was never sober.</P>
<P>IN this Life of Hellish Excess, <HI>as I have said,</HI>
She lost all that was before so Valuable in her;
and a Villain, if it be proper to call a Man,
that was really a Gentleman, by such a Name,
who was an intimate Acquaintance coming to
pretend a Visit to her, made her and her Maid
so Drunk together, that he lay with them both;
with the Mistress the Maid being in the Room,
and with the Maid, the Mistress being in the
Room; after which, he it seems took the like Li∣berty
with them both, as often as he thought fit,
'till the Wench being with Child, discover'd it for
her self, and for her Mistress too: Let any one
judge what was my Case now; I that for six
Years thought my self the happyest Man a live,
was now the most miserable distracted Creature:
As to my Wife, I loved her so well, and was so
sensible of the Dissaster of her Drinking, being
the Occasion of it all, that I could not resent
it to such a Degree as I had done in her Predecessor;
but I pity'd her heartily; however, I put away
all her Servants, and almost lock'd her up; <HI>that
is to say,</HI> I set new People over her, who would
not suffer any one to come near her, without my
Knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT what to do with the Villain, that had
thus abused both her and me, <HI>that was the Questi∣on
that remain'd;</HI> to fight him upon equal Terms,
I thought, was a little hard; that after a Man
had treated me as he had done, he deserv'd no
fair Play for his Life, so I resolv'd to wait
for him in <HI>Stepney</HI> Fields, and which Way he
often came Home pretty late, and Pistol him
<PB N="411" REF="317"/>
in the Dark, and if possible, to let him know
what I Kill'd him for, before I did it: But when I
came to consider of this, it shock'd my Temper too,
as well as Principle, and I could not be a Mur∣derer;
whatever else I could be, or what ever I
was provok'd to be.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I resolv'd on the other Hand, that
I would severely correct him for what he had
done, and it was not long before I had an Oppor∣tunity;
for hearing one Morning that he was
walking cross the Fields, from <HI>Stepney</HI> to <HI>Shadwel,</HI>
which Way I knew he often went; I waited
for his coming Home again, and fairly met
him.</P>
<P>I had not many Words with him, but told
him, I had long look'd for him; that he knew the
Villaniy he had been guilty of in my Family,
and he could not believe, since he knew also, that
I was fully inform'd of it; but that I must be
a great Coward as well as a Cuckold, or that I
would resent it, and that it was now a very
proper Time to call him to an Account for it,
and therefore bad him, if he durst show his Face
to what he had done, and defend the Name of
a Captain of a Man of War, <HI>as they said,</HI> he had
been, to draw.</P>
<P>HE seem'd surpriz'd at the Thing, and began
to Parlee, and would lessen the Crime of it; but
I told him it was not a time to talk that Way,
since he could not deny the Fact; and to lessen the
Crime, was to lay it the more upon the Woman,
who, I was sure if he had not first debauch'd with
Wine, he could never have brought to the rest;
and seeing he refused to draw, I knock'd him
down with my Cane at one Blow; and I would
not strike him again while he lay on the Ground,
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>
but waited to see him recover a little, for I saw
plainly he was not kill'd; in a few Minutes he
came to himself again, and then I took him fast
by one Wrist, and can'd him as severely as I
was able, and as long as I could hold it, for want
of Breath, but forbore his Head, because I was re∣solv'd
he should feel it; in this Condition at
last he begg'd for Mercy, but I was Deaf to all
Pitty a great while, till he roar'd out like a Boy
soundly whipt; then I took his Sword from him,
and broke it before his Face, and left him on the
Ground, giving him two or three Kicks on the
Back-side, and bad him go and take the Law of
me, if he thought fit.</P>
<P>I had now as much Satisfaction, as indeed could
be taken of a Coward, and had no more to say
to him: But as I knew it would make a great
Noise about the Town, I immediately remov'd my
Family, and that I might be perfectly conceal'd,
went into the North of <HI>England,</HI> and liv'd in a
little Town called,—not far from <HI>Lancaster,</HI>
where I liv'd retir'd, and was no more heard of,
for about two Years. My Wife tho' more con∣fin'd
than she used to be, and so kept up from
the leu'd part; which I believe in the Intervals
of her Intemperance, she was truly ashamed of,
and abhor'd; yet retain'd the Drinking part,
which becoming <HI>as I have said,</HI> necessary for her
Subsistance, she soon ruin'd her health, and in a∣bout
a Year and a half after my Removal into the
<HI>North</HI> she died.</P>
<P>THUS I was once more a free Man, and as one
would think, should by this time, have been ful∣ly
satisfy'd that Matrimony was not appointed
to be a State of Felicity to me.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319"/>
I should have mention'd, that the Villain of a
Captain, who I had drub'd, <HI>as above,</HI> pretended to
make a great Stir about my assaulting him on the
High-Way, and that I had fallen upon him with
three Ruffians with an Intent to murther him, and
this began to obtain Belief among the People
in the Neighbourhood: I sent him Word of so
much of it as I had heard, and told him I hoped
it did not come from his own Mouth, but if it
did, I expected he would publickly disown it, he
himself declaring he knew it to be false; or else
that I should be forced to act the same thing over
again, till I had disciplin'd him into better Man∣ners;
and that he might be assured, that if he
continued to pretend that I had any Body with
me when I caned him, I would publish the whole
Story in Print, and besides that, would Cane
him again where ever I met him, and as often as
I met him, till he thought fit to defend himself
with his Sword like a Gentleman.</P>
<P>HE gave me no Answer to this Letter, and
the Satisfaction I had for that was, that I gave
twenty or thirty Copies of it about among the
Neighbours, which made it as publick as if I had
printed it, (that is, as to his Acquaintance, and mine)
and made him so hiss'd at, and hated, that he
was obliged to remove, into some other part of
the Town, whither, I did not enquire.</P>
<P>MY Wife being now dead, I knew not what
Course to take in the World, and I grew so dis∣consolate
and discouraged, that I was next Door
to being distempered, and sometimes indeed, I
thought my self a little touch'd in my Head. But
it proved nothing but Vapours, and the Vexation
of this Affair, and in about a Years time, or there
abouts, it wore off again.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="320"/>
I had rambl'd up and down in a most discon∣tented
unsettled Posture after this, <HI>I say,</HI> about
a Year, and then I consider'd I had three innocent
Children, and I could take no Care of them, and
that I must either go away and leave them to the
wide World, or settle here, and get some Body to
look after them, and that better a Mother-in-Law,
than no Mother, for to live such a wandring Life,
it would not do: So I resolved, I would marry as
any thing offer'd, tho' it was mean, and the
meaner the better; I concluded my next Wife
should be only taken as an upper Servant, <HI>that
is to say,</HI> a Nurse to my Children, and a House∣keeper
to my self, and let her be whore or honest
Woman, <HI>said I,</HI> as she likes best, I am resolv'd
I wont much concern my self about that, for
I was now one desperate, that valued not how
things went.</P>
<P>IN this careless, and indeed, rash foolish Hu∣mour,
I talk'd to my self thus; if I Marry an honest
Woman, my Children will be taken care of; if
she be a Slut and abuses me, as I see every Body
does; I'll Kidnap her and send her to <HI>Virginia</HI>
to my Plantations there, and there she shall work
hard enough, and fare hard enough to keep her
Chast, I'll warrant her.</P>
<P>I knew well enough at first, that these were
mad, hare-brain'd Notions, and I thought no more
of being serious in them, than I thought of being
a Man in the Moon: But I know not how it hap∣pen'd
to me; I reason'd and talk'd to my self in
this wild manner so long, that I brought my
self to be seriously desperate, <HI>that is,</HI> to resolve
upon another Marriage; with all the Suppositions
of Unhappiness that could be imagined to fall
out.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="321"/>
AND yet even this rash Resolution of my
Sences did not come presently to Action, for I
was half a Year after this, before I fix'd upon any
thing; at last, as he that seeks Mischief, shall
certainly find it, so it was with me, there hap∣pen'd
to be a young, or rather a middle aged Wo∣man
in the next Town, which was but half a
Mile off, who usually was at my House, and a∣mong
my Children every Day, when the Weather
was tolerable; and tho' she came, but meerly as a
Neighbour, and to see us, yet she was always
helpful in directing, and ordering things for them,
and mighty handy about them, as well before my
Wife died as after.</P>
<P>HER Father was one that I employed often
to go to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and sometimes to <HI>Whitehaven,</HI>
and do Business for me; for having as it were set∣tled
myself in these Northern parts of <HI>England;</HI> I
had order'd part of my Effects to be Shipp'd as
Occasion of shipping offered to either of those two
Towns, to which (the War continuing very sharp)
it was safer coming as to Privateers, than about
thro' the <HI>Channel</HI> to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I took a mighty Fancy at last, that this Girl
would answer my End, particularly that as I saw
she was mighty useful among the Children, so
on the other Hand, the Children lov'd her very
well, and I resolv'd to love her too; flattering my∣self
mightily, that as I had Married two Gentle∣women,
and one Citizen, and they prov'd all three
Whores, I should now find what I wanted in an
innocent Country Wench.</P>
<P>I took up a World of time in Considering of
this Matter: Indeed scarce any of my Matches
were done without very mature Consideration;
the second was the worst in that Article, but in
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>
this I thought of it, I believe four Months most
seriously before I resolv'd, and that very Pru∣dence
spoil'd the whole thing; however, at last
being resolv'd, I took Mrs. <HI>Margaret</HI> one Day
as she pass'd by my Parlour door, call'd her in, and
told her I wanted to speak with her; she came rea∣dily
in, but blush'd mightily, when I bad her fit
down, for I bad her sit down in a Chair just by me.</P>
<P>I Us'd no great Ceremony with her, but told
her that I had observ'd she had been mighty kind
to my Children, and was very tende to them,
and that they all lov'd her, and that if she and
I could agree about it; I intended to make her their
Mother, if she was not engag'd to some Body else;
the Girl sat still, and said never a Word, <HI>till I said
those Words,</HI> if she was not engag'd to some Body
else; however, I took no Notice of it, other than
this, look ye <HI>Moggy, said</HI> I; so they call them
in the Country, if you have promis'd your∣self
you must tell me; for we all knew that a
young Fellow, a good Clergyman's wicked Son,
had hung about her a great while, two or three
Year, and made Love to her, but could never get
the Girl in the Mind it seems to have him.</P>
<P>SHE knew I was not ignorant of it, and there∣fore
after her first surprise was over, she told me
Mr.—had as I knew often come after
her, but she had never promis'd him any thing, an
had for several Years refus'd him; her Father al∣ways
telling her that he was a wicked Fellow, and
the he would be her Ruin if she had him.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>Moggy,</HI> then, <HI>says I,</HI> what dost say to
me, art thou free to make me a Wife? She blush'd
and look'd down upon the Ground, and would not
speak a good while, but when I press'd her to
tell me, she look'd up, <HI>and said she,</HI> suppos'd I was
but Jesting with her; well, I got over that, and
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
told her, I was in very good earnest with her, and
I took her for a sober, honest, modest Girl, and
as, <HI>I said,</HI> one that my Children lov'd mighty
well, and I was in earnest with her, if she would
give me her Consent: I would give her my Word,
that I would have her, and we would be married
to morrow Morning; she look'd up again at that,
and smil'd a little, and said no, that was too soon
too, to say yes; she hop'd I would give her some
time to Consider of it, and to talk with her
Father about it.</P>
<P>I told he she needed not much time to Consi∣der
about it, but however, I would give her till to
morrow Morning, which was a great while; by
this time I had kiss'd <HI>Moggy</HI> two or three times,
and she began to be freer with me, and when I
press'd her to Marry me the next Morning, she
laugh'd and told me it was not lucky, to be mar∣ried
in her old Cloths.</P>
<P>I stopp'd her Mouth presently with that, and
told her she should not be married in her old
Cloths, for I would give her some new; <HI>ay, it may
be afterwards</HI> says <HI>Moggy,</HI> and laugh'd again: No,
just now, <HI>says I,</HI> come along with me <HI>Moggy;</HI> so
I carried her up Stairs into my Wive's Room that
was, and shew'd her a new Morning Gown of my
Wives, that she had never worn above two or three
times, and several other fine things; look you there
<HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> there's a Wedding Gown for you,
give me your Hand uow that you will have me to
morrow Morning, and as to your Father, you
know he is gone to <HI>Liverpool</HI> on my Business, but
I will answer for it, he shall not be angry when
he comes Home to call his Master Son-in-law,
and I ask him no Portion; therefore give me thy
Hand for it <HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> very merrily to her,
<PB N="318" REF="324"/>
and kiss'd her again, and the Girl gave me her
Hand, and very pleasantly too, and I was mightily
pleas'd with it, I assure you.</P>
<P>THERE liv'd about three Doors from us, an
antient Gentleman, who pass'd for a Doctor
of Physick, but who was really a <HI>Romish</HI> Priest
in Orders, as there are many in that Part of the
Country, and in the Evening I sent to speak
with him: He knew that I understood his Pro∣fession,
and that I had liv'd in Popish Countries,
and in a Word, believ'd me a <HI>Roman</HI> too, for I
was such Abroad: When he came to me, I told
him the occasion, for which I sent for him, and
that it was to be to morrow Morning; he readi∣ly
told me, if I would come, and see him in the
Evening, and bring <HI>Moggy</HI> with me, he would
Marry us in his own Study, and that it was
rather more Private to do it in the Evening,
than in the Morning; so I call'd <HI>Moggy</HI> again to
me, and told her since she and I had agreed
the Matter for to Morrow, it was as well to be
done over Night, and told her what the Doctor
had said.</P>
<P><HI>Moggy</HI> blush'd again, <HI>and said,</HI> she must go
Home first, that she could not be ready before to
Morrow; look ye <HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> you are my Wife
now, and you shall never go away from me a
Maid, I know what you mean, you would go
Home to shift you: Come <HI>Moggy, sayes I,</HI> come
along with me again up Stairs, so I carried her to
a Chest of Linnen, where was several new shifts
of my last Wives, which she had never worn at
all, and some that had been worn, there's a clean
Smock for you <HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> and to Morrow
you shall have all the rest: When I had done this,
now <HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> go and Dress you; so I
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
lock'd her in, and went down Stairs; knock <HI>says
I,</HI> when you are Dress'd.</P>
<P>AFTER sometime, <HI>Moggy</HI> did not knock, but
down she came into my Room, compleatly dress'd,
for there were several other things that I bad her
take, and the Cloths fitted her, as if they had
been made for her, it seems she slipt the Lock back.</P>
<P>WELL <HI>Moggy, says I,</HI> now you see you shan't
be marry'd in your old Cloaths, so I took her
in my Arms, and kiss'd her, and well pleased I
was, as ever I was in my Life, or with any thing
I ever did in my Life; as soon as it was Dark,
<HI>Moggy</HI> slip'd away before-hand, as the Doctor and
I had agreed, to the old Gentleman's House-keeper;
and I came in about half an Hour after,
and there we were marry'd in the Doctor's Study,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> in his Oratory, or Chapel, a lit∣tle
Room within his Study, and we stay'd and
supp'd with him afterward.</P>
<P>WHEN after a short Stay more, I went Home
first, because I would send the Children all to
Bed, and the other Servants out of the Way, and
<HI>Moggey</HI> came some time after, and so we lay to∣gether
that Night; the next Morning I let all the
Family know that <HI>Moggy</HI> was my Wife; and my
three Children were rejoyc'd at it to the last
Degree: And now I was a marry'd Man a fourth
Time; and in short, I was really more happy
in this plain country Girl, than with any of all
the Wives I had, had: She was not Young, being
about three and Thirty, but she brought me a
Son the first Year; she was very pretty, well
shap'd, and of a merry chearful Disposition, but
not a Beauty; she was an admirable Family Ma∣nager;
lov'd my former Children, and used them
not at all the worse for having some of her own,
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
in a Word, she made me an excellent Wife; but
liv'd with me but four Year, and dy'd of a
Hurt she got of a Fall while she was with
Child, and in her I had a very great Loss in∣deed.</P>
<P>AND yet such was my Fate in Wives, that after
all the Blushing, and Backwardness of Mrs.
<HI>Moggy</HI> at first, Mrs. <HI>Moggy</HI> had, it seems, made a
Slip in her younger Days, and was got with
Child ten Year before, by a Gentleman of a
great Estate in that Country who promised her
Marriage, and afterwards deferted her: But as
that had happen'd long before I came into the
Country, and the Child was dead and forgotten,
the People were so good to her, and so kind to
me, that hearing I hard marry'd her, no Body e∣ver
spoke of it, neither did I ever hear of it, or
suspect it, till after she was in her Grave, and
then it was of small Conesquence to me one way
or other and she was a faithful, virtuous, obliging
Wife, to me. I had very severe Affliction in∣deed,
while she lived with me, for the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI>
a frightful Distemper in that Country,
broke into my Family, and carry'd off three of
my Children, and a Maid Servant; so that I
had only one of my former Wives, and one
by my <HI>Moggy,</HI> the first a Son, the last a
Daughter.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were in agitation, came
on the Invasion of the Scots, and the Fight at
<HI>Preston,</HI> and I have cause to bless the Memory of
my <HI>Moggy,</HI> for I was all on Fire on that Side,
and just going away with Horse and Arms, to
joyn the Lord <HI>Darwentwater,</HI> but <HI>Moggy</HI> begg'd
me off, <HI>as I may call it,</HI> and hung about me
so, with her Tears and Importunities that I
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
sat still and look'd on, for which I had Reason
to be thankful.</P>
<P>I was really a sorrowful Father, and the loss
of my Children, stuck close to me, but the loss
of my Wife stuck closer to me than all the rest,
nor was my grief lessen'd, or my kindest Thoughts
abated in the least by the Account I heard of
her former Miscarriages, seeing they were so
long before I knew her, and were not discover'd
by me or to me in her life time.</P>
<P>ALL these things put together made me very
Comfortless: And now I thought Heaven summon'd
me to retire to <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Place, and as I may
say, the only Place I had been bless'd at, or had met
with any thing that deserv'd the Name of Suc∣cess
in, and where indeed my Affairs being in good
Hands, the Plantations were encreas'd to such a
Degree, that some Years my return here made up
eight Hundred Pound, and one Year almost a
Thousand, so I resolv'd to leave my native
Country once more, and taking my Son with me,
and leaving <HI>Moggy</HI>'s Daughter with her Grand∣father,
I made him my principal Agent, left him
considerable in his Hands, for the Maintenance of
the Child, and left my Will in his Hand, by
which, if I died before I should otherwise Pro∣vide
for her, I left her 2000 <HI>l.</HI> Portion to be
paid by my Son out of the Estate I had in <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI>
and the whole Estate if he died unmarried.</P>
<P>I embark'd for <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the Year—, at
the Town of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and had a tollerable Voy∣age
thither, only that we met with a Pyrate Ship,
in the Latitude of 48 Degrees, who Plunder'd us of
every thing they could come at that was for their
turn, <HI>that is to say,</HI> Provisions, Ammunition, small
Arms and Money; but to give the Rogues their
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
Due, tho' they were the most abandon'd Wretches
that were ever seen, they did not use us ill; and
as to my Loss, it was not considerable, the Car∣go
which I had on Board, was in Goods, and was
of no use to them; nor could they come at those
things without Rumaging the whole Ship, which
they did not think worth their while.</P>
<P>I found all my Affairs in very good order at
<HI>Virginia,</HI> my Plantations prodigiously increas'd,
and my Manager, who first inspired me with
travelling Thoughts, and made me Master of
any Knowledge worth Naming, receiv'd me with
a transport of Joy, after a Ramble of four and
Twenty Years.</P>
<P>I ought to remember it to the encouragement
of all faithful Servants, that he gave me an Ac∣count,
which I believe was critically Just, of the
whole Affair of the Plantations, each by them∣selves;
and Ballanc'd in Years, every Years pro∣duce,
being fully transmitted; Charges deducted
to my Order at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I was exceedingly satisfy'd, as I had good Rea∣son
indeed with his Management, and with his Ma∣nagement,
as much in its degree of his Own, I can
safely say it: He had Improv'd a very large Planta∣tion
of his own at the same time, which he began
upon the Foot of the Countries Allowance of
Land, and the Encouragement he had from me.</P>
<P>WHEN he had given me all this pleasing a∣greeable
Account you will not think it strange,
that I had a desire to see the Plantations, and
to View all the Servants, which in both the Works
were upwards of three hundred; and as my Tu∣tor
generally bought some every Fleet that came
from <HI>England,</HI> I had the Mortification to see two
or three of the <HI>Preston</HI> Gentlemen there, who being
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
Prisoners of War, were spar'd from the pub∣lick
Execution, and sent over for to that Sla∣very,
which to Gentlemen must be worse than
Death.</P>
<P>I do not mention what I did or said, relating
to them here, I shall speak at large of it, when
the rest of them came over, which more nearly
concern'd me.</P>
<P>BUT one Circumstance occurr'd to me here,
that equally surpris'd me, and terrify'd me to the
last degree; looking over all the Servants, as I
say <HI>above,</HI> and viewing the Plantations narrow∣ly
and frequently, I came one Day by a place
were some Women were at Work by themselves:
I was seriously reflecting on the Misery of human
Life, when I saw some of those poor Wretches;
thought I, they have perhaps liv'd gay, and plea∣santly
in the World, notwithstanding, thro' a vari∣ety
of Distresses, they may have been brought to
this; and if a Body was to hear the History of
some of them now, it would perhaps be as mo∣ving,
and as seasonable a Sermon as any Mini∣ster
in the Country could Preach.</P>
<P>WHILE I was musing thus, and looking at the
Women, on a sudden I heard a Combustion a∣mong
other of the Women Servants, who were
almost behind me, in the same Work, and help was
call'd loudly for, one of the Women having swoon'd
away; they said she would die immediately if
something was not done to relieve her; I had no∣thing
about me, but a litle Bottle, which we al∣ways
carried about us there with Rum, to give
any Servant a Dram that merited that Favour; so
I turn'd my Horse and went up towards the
Place; but as the poor Creature was lying flat
on the Ground, and the rest of the Women Ser∣vants
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
about her, I did not see her, but gave them
the Bottle, and they rubb'd her Temples with it,
and with much a do brought her to Life, and gave
her a little to Drink; but she could Drink none
of it, and was exceeding ill afterwards; so that
she was carried to the Infirmary, so they call it
in the Religious Houses in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the sick
Nuns or Friers, are carried; but here in <HI>Virginia,</HI>
I think they should call it the Condemn'd-hole,
for it really was only a Place just fit for People to
die in, not a Place to be cur'd in.</P>
<P>THE sick Woman refusing to Drink, one of the
Women Servants brought me the Bottle again, and
I bad them Drink it among them, which had al∣most
set them together by the Ears, for the Li∣quor,
there being not enough to give every one
a Sup.</P>
<P>I went home to my House immediately, and re∣flecting
on the miserable Provision was wont to be
made for poor Servants, when they were sick, I
inquir'd of my Manager, if it was so still? <HI>he said,</HI>
he believ'd mine was better than any in the Coun∣try;
but he confess'd it was but sad Lodging; how∣ever,
<HI>he said,</HI> he would go and look after it imme∣diately,
and see how it was.</P>
<P>HE came to me again, about an Hour after,
and told me the Woman was very ill, and fright∣ed
with her Condition, that she seem'd to be very
Penitent, for some things in her past Life, which
lay heavy upon her Mind, believing she should
die; that she ask'd him, if there was no Mini∣ster
to Comfort poor dying Servants; and he
told her, that she knew they had no Minister
nearer than such a Place, but that if she liv'd till
Morning, he should be sent for; he told me also,
that he had remov'd her into a Room where their
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
chief Workman us'd to Lodge; that he had gi∣ven
her a pair of Sheets, and every thing he
could, that he thought she wanted, and had ap∣pointed
another Woman Servant to tend her, and
sit up with her.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says I,</HI> that's well, for I cannot bear
to have poor Creatures lye and perish, by the
meer Hardship of the Place they are in, when
they are Sick, and want help; besides, <HI>said I,</HI> some
of those unfortunate Creatures, they call Con∣victs,
may be People that have been tenderly
brought up, really Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> this poor Creature
I always said had something of a Gentlewo∣man
in her, I could see it by her Behaviour, and
I have heard the other Women say, that she liv'd
very great once, and that she had fifteeu Hun∣dred
Pound to her Portion, and I dare say she has
been a handsome Woman in her time, and she has
a Hand as fine as a Ladies now; tho' it be Tan∣ned
with the Weather; I dare say she was never
brought up to Labour as she does here, and she
says to the rest that it will kill her.</P>
<P>TRULY, <HI>says I,</HI> it may be so, and that may be
the Reason that she faints under it; and, <HI>I added,</HI>
is there nothing you can put her to within Doors,
that may not be so Laborious, and expose her to
so much Heat and Cold; he told me <HI>yes,</HI> there
was; he could set her to be the House-keeper, for
the Woman that lately was such, was out of her
Time, and was married and turn'd Planter. Why
then let her have it, said I, if she Recovers, and in
the mean time go, <HI>said I,</HI> and tell her so, per∣haps
the Comfort of it may help Restore her.</P>
<P>HE did so, and with that, taking good care of
her, and giving her good warm Dyet, the Wo∣man
recover'd, and in a little time was Abroad
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
again, for it was the meer Weight of Labour
and being expos'd to hard Lodging, and mean
Dyet, to one so tenderly bred, that struck her,
and she fainted at her Work.</P>
<P>WHEN she was made House-Keeper, she was
quite another Body; she put all the Houshold
in such excellent Order, and manag'd their Pro∣visions
so well, that my Tutor admir'd her Con∣duct,
and would be every now and then, speak∣ing
of her to me; that she was an excellent Mana∣ger;
I'll warrant, <HI>says he,</HI> she has been Bred a Gentle∣woman,
and she has been a fine Woman in her time
too: In a Word, he said so many good things of her,
that I had a mind to see her; so one Day I took oc∣casion
to go to the Plantation House, as they call'd
it and into a Parlour always reserv'd for the Master
of the Plantation; there she had Opportunity to
see me before I could see her, and as soon as she had
seen me, she knew me; but indeed had I seen her
an Hundred times, I should not have known her she
was it seems in the greatest Confusion, and Surprize
at seeing who I was, that it was possible for a∣ny
one to be; and when I order'd my Manager to
bring her into the Room, he found her crying, and
beg'd him to excuse her, that she was frighted,
and should die away, if she came near me.</P>
<P>I NOT imagining any thing, but that the
poor Creature was afraid of me, <HI>for Masters in</HI>
Virginia <HI>are terrible things;</HI> bad him tell her she
need to be under no Concern at my calling for
her, for it was not for any hurt, nor any Displea∣sure;
but that I had some Orders to give her;
so having as he thought encourag'd her, <HI>tho' her
surprize was of another kind,</HI> he brought her in;
when she came in, she held a Handkerchief in her
Hand, wiping her Eyes, as if she had cry'd, Mrs.
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
House-keeper, <HI>said I,</HI> speaking chearfully to her,
don't be concern'd at my sending for you, I have
had a very good Account of your Management,
and I call'd for you, to let you know I am very
well pleas'd with it; and if it falls in my way to
do you any good, if your Circumstances will al∣low
it, I may be willing enough to help you out
of your Misery.</P>
<P>SHE made low Curtisies, but said nothing,
however, she was so far encourag'd that she took
her Hand from her Face, and I saw her Face ful∣ly,
and I believe she did it, desiring I should disco∣ver
who she was, but I really knew nothing of
her any more, than if I had never seen her in my
Life; but went on as I thought to encourage her
as I us'd to do with any that I saw deserv'd it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time my Tutor, who was in the
Room went out on some Business or other, I know
not what; as soon as he was gone, she burst out
into a Passion, and falling down on her Knees just
before me, O! Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> I see you don't know
me, be merciful to me, I am your miserable
divorc'd Wife!</P>
<P>I WAS astonish'd, I was frighted, I trembled
like one in an Ague, I was Speechless; in a Word,
I was ready to sink, and she fell flat on her Face,
and lay there, as if she had been dead; I was
Speechless, <HI>I say,</HI> as a Stone, I had only Pre∣sence
of Mind enough to step to the Door, and
fasten it, that my Tutor might not come in:
Then going back to her, I took her up, and spoke
comfortably to her, and told her, I no more knew
her, than if I had never seen her.</P>
<P>O! Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> Afflictions are dreadful
Things, such as I have suffer'd have been enough
to alter my Countenance; but forgive <HI>said she,</HI> for
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
God's sake the Injuries I have done you! I have paid
dear for all my wickedness, and 'tis just, 'tis right∣eous
that God should bring me to your Foot, to ask
you Pardon for all my brutish doings: Forgive me
Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> I beseech you, and let me be your Slave
or Servant for it as long as I live; 'tis all I ask,
and with those Words, she fell upon her Knees
again, and cry'd so vehemently, that it was im∣possible
for her to stop it, or to speak a Word
more: I took her up again, made her sit down,
desir'd her to Compose herself, and to hear what
I was going to say, tho' indeed it touch'd
me so sensibly, I was hardly able to speak any
more then she was.</P>
<P>FIRST, I told her it was such a surprize to me,
that I was not able to say much to her, <HI>and indeed
the Tears ran down my Face almost as fast as they did
on hers,</HI> I told her that I should only tell <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
now, that as no Body had yet known any thing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that had pass'd, so it was absolutely necessary,
not a Word of it should be known, that it should
not be the worse for her, that she was thus
thrown into my Hands again; but that I
could do nothing for her, if it was known, and
therefore that her future good, or ill Fortune
would depend upon her entire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncealing it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat
as my Manager would come in again presently,
she should go back to her part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
go on in the Business, as she did before; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I
would come to her, and talk more at large with her
in a Day or two; so she retir'd, after assuring me
that not a word of it should go out of her Mouth,
and indeed she was willing to retire before my
Tutor came again, that he might not see the Ago∣ny
she was in.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="335"/>
I WAS so perplex'd about this surprizing
Incident, that I hardly knew what I did, or said
all that Night, nor was I come to any settled Re∣solution
in the Morning, what Course to take in
it: However, in that Morning I call'd my Tutor,
and told him that I had been exceedingly con∣cern'd
about the poor distress'd Creature, the
House-Keeper; that I had heard some of her
Story, which was very dismal; that she had been
in very good Circumstances, and was bred very
well, and that I was glad he had remov'd her
Out of the Field into the House, but still she was
almost naked, and that I would have him go to
the Warehouse, and give her some Linnen; espe∣cially
Head Cloaths, and all sorts of small things,
such as Hoods, Gloves, Stockings, Shoes, Petty-Coats,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to let her chuse for her self; al∣so,
a Morning-Gown of Callico, and a Mantua
of a better kind of Callico, <HI>that is to say,</HI> to new
Cloa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her, which he did: But brought me
Word, that he found her all in Tears, and that
she had cry'd all Night long, and in short, that
he believ'd, she would indeed, cry her self to
Death; that all the while she was receiving the
things he gave her, she cry'd; that now and
then she would struggle with, and stop it, but
that then upon another Word speaking, she
would burst out again, so that it griev'd every
Body that saw her.</P>
<P>I WAS really affected with her Case very
much, but strugled hard with my self, to hide
it, and turn'd the Discourse to something else,
in the mean time, tho' I did not go to her the
next Day, nor till the third Day, yet I study'd
Day and Night, how to Act, and what I should
do in this remarkable Case.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="336"/>
WHEN I came to the House which was the third
Day, she came into the Room I was in, cloath'd
all over with my Things, which I had ordered
her, and told me she thank'd God, she was now my
Servant again, and wore my Livery, thank'd me
for the Cloaths I had sent her; and said it was
much more than she had deserv'd from me.</P>
<P>I then entered into Discourses with her, <HI>no
Body being present but our selves,</HI> and first, <HI>I told
her,</HI> She should name no more of the unkind
things that had past, for she had humbled herself
more than enough on that Subject, and I would
never reproach her with any thing that was
past; I found that she had been the deepest
sufferer by far, I told her it was impossible
for me in my present Circumstances to receive
her there as a Wife, who came over as a Convict,
neither did she know so little, as to desire it.
But, <HI>I told her,</HI> I might be Instrumental to
put an End to her Misfortunes in the World,
and especially to the miserable part of it;
which was her present Load, provided she could
effectually keep her own Council, and never let
the particulars come out of her Mouth, and that
from the Day she did, she might date her irre∣coverable
Ruin.</P>
<P>SHE was as sensible of the Necessity of that
Part, as I was, and told me all she could claim
of me, would be only to deliver her from her
present Calamity, that she was not able to
support, and that then if I pleased, she might
live such a Life, as that she might apply the re∣sidue
of what time she should have, wholly to
Repentance; that she was willing to do the mean∣est
Offices in the World for me, and tho' she
should rejoyce to hear that I would forgive her
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
former Life, yet that she would not look any
higher than to be my Servant, as long as she
liv'd, and in the mean time, I might be satis∣fy'd
she would not let any Creature so much as
know that I had ever seen her before.</P>
<P>I ASK'D her, if she was willing to let me in∣to
any Part of the History of her Life, since she
and I Parted, but I did not Insist upon it, o∣therwise,
than as she thought convenient; <HI>she
said,</HI> as her Breach with me began first in Folly,
and ended in Sin, so her whole Life afterward,
was a continu'd Series of Callamity, Sin and
Sorrow, Sin and Shame, and at last Misery; that
she was deluded into Gay Company, and to an
expensive way of Living, which betray'd her
to several wicked Courses to support the Ex∣pences
of it; that after a thousand Distresses
and Difficulties, being not able to maintain her
self, she was reduced to extreme Poverty.</P>
<P>THAT she would many Times have humbled
her self to me in the lowest and most submissive
manner in the World, being sincerely Penitent
for her first Crime, but that she could never hear
of me, nor which way I was gone; that she was
by that Means so abandon'd, that she wanted
Bread, and those Wants and Distresses brought
her into bad Company of another Kind, and
that she fell in among a Gang of Thieves, with
whom she Herded for sometime, and got
Money enough a great while, but under the
greatest Dread and Terror imaginable, being in
the constant Fear of coming to Shame, that
afterwards, what she fear'd, was come upon her,
and for a very triffling Attempt, in which she
was not Principal, but accidentally concern'd,
She was sent to this Place: She told me, her
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
Life was such a Collection of various Fortunes,
up and down, in Plenty, and in Misery; in Pri∣son,
and at Liberty; at Ease, and in Torment;
that it would take up a great many Days to give
me a History of it, that I was come to see the
End of it, as I had seen the best part of the Be∣ginning,
that I knew she was brought up tender∣ly,
and fair'd delicately, but that now she was
with the Prodigal, brought to desire Husks with
Swine and even to want that Supply: Her Tears
flow'd so Strongly upon this Discourse, that they
frequently interrupted her, so that she could not
go on without Difficulty; and at last could not go
on at all, so I told her, I would excuse her
telling any more of her Story at that Time; that
I saw it was but a renewing of her Grief, and
that I would rather Contribute to her forgeting
what was past, and desir'd her to say no more of
it, so I broke off that Part.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I told her, since Providence
had thus cast her upon my Hands again, I would
take Care that she should not want, and that she
should not live hardly neither, tho' I could go
no farther at present; and thus we parted for that
Time; and she continu'd in the Business of
House keeper; only, that to ease her, I gave
her an Assistant, and tho' I would not have it
call'd so, it was neither more nor less than a
Servant to wait on her, and do every thing for
her, and told her to, that it was so.</P>
<P>AFTER she had been some time in this Place,
she recover'd her Spirits, and grew chearful; her
fallen Flesh plump'd up, and the sunk and hollow
parts fill'd again, so that began to recover
something of that Brightness, and Charming Coun∣tenance,
which was once so very agreeable to
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
me; and sometimes I could not help having warm
Desires towards her, and of taking her into her
first Station again; but there were many Difficul∣ties
occur'd, which I could not get over a great
while.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean time an other odd Accident
happen'd, which put me to a very great. Diffi∣culty,
and more than I could have thought such
a thing could be capable of; my Tutor, a Man of
Wit and Learning, and Full of generous Princi∣ples,
who was at first mov'd with Compassion for
the Misery of this Gentlewoman, and even then,
thought there were somethings more than Com∣mon
in her, as I have hinted: Now, when, as I
say, she was recover'd, and her sprightly Temper
restor'd, and comforted, he was charm'd so with
her Conversation, that in short, he fell in Love
with her</P>
<P>I hinted in my former Account of her,
that she had a Charming Tongue, was Mistress
of abundance of Wit, that she sung incom∣paribly
fine, and was perfectly well Bred,
these all remained with her still, and made
her a very agreeable Person; and in short, he
came to me one Evening, and told me, that
he came to ask my Leave to let him marry the
House-keeper.</P>
<P>I WAS exceedingly perplex'd at this Proposal,
but however, I gave him no Room to perceive
that; I told him, I hop'd he had consider'd
well of it, before he brought it so far as to offer
it to me, and suppos'd that he had agreed
that Point so; that I had no Consent to give,
but as she had almost four Year of her Time
to Serve.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="340"/>
HE answer'd no, he paid such a regard
to me, that he would not so much as take one
step in such a thing without my Knowledge, and
assur'd me, he had not so much as mentioned it
to her; I knew not what answer indeed to make
to him, but at last I resolv'd to put it off from
from myself to her, because then I should have
opportunity to talk with her before hand; so I
told him was perfectly free to act in the matter
as he thought fit; that I could not say either,
one thing or another to it, neither had I any
right to meddle in it; as to her serving out her
time with me, that was a Trifle, and not worth
Naming; but I hop'd he would consider well e∣very
Circumstances before he entered upon such
an Affair as that.</P>
<P>HE told me he had fully consider'd it already,
and that he was resolv'd, seeing I was not against it,
to have her whatever came of it; for he believ'd
he should be the happiest Man alive with her,
then he run on in his Character of her, how clever
a Woman she was, in the management of all man∣ner
of Business; how admirable Conversation she
was; what a Wit, what a Memory, what a vast
share of Knowledge, and the like; all which I
knew to be the Truth, and yet short of her just
Character too; for as she was all that formerly,
when she was mine, she was vastly improv'd in
the School of Affliction, and was all the bright
Part, with a vast Addition of Temper, Prudence,
Judgment, and all that she formerly wanted.</P>
<P>I HAD not much Patiaence at you may well
imagine, till I saw my honest House-keeper to
communicate this Secret to her, and to see what
Course she would steer on so nice an Occasion; but
I was suddenly taken so ill with a Cold, which held
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
for two Days, that I could not stir out of Doors
and in this time the matter was all done, and
over, for my Tutor had gone the same Night, and
made his attack, but was coldly receiv'd at first,
which very much surpris'd him, for he made no
doubt to have her consent at first Word; how∣ever,
the next Day he came again, and again the
third Day, when finding he was in earnest, and yet
that she could not think of any thing of that kind;
she told him in few Words that she thought herself
greatly oblig'd to him for such a Testimony of his
Respect to her, and should have embrac'd it willing∣ly,
as any Body would suppose one in her Circum∣stances
should do, but that she would not abuse him
so much; for that she must acknowledg to him, she
was under Obligations that prevented her, that
was, in short, that she was a married Woman, and
and had a Husband alive.</P>
<P>THIS was so sincere, but so Effectual an An∣swer,
that he could have no room to reply one Word
to it; but that he was very sorry, and that it
was a very great Affiction to him, and as a great
Disappointment as ever he met with.</P>
<P>THE next Day after he had received this re∣pulse
I came to the Plantation House, and send∣ing
for the House-keeper, I began with her, and
told her that I understood she would have a very
advantageous Proposal made to her, and that
I would have her Consider well of it, and then
told her what my Tutor had said to me.</P>
<P>SHE immediately fell a crying, at which I
seem'd to wonder very much, O! Sir, <HI>says she,</HI>
how can you Name, such a thing to me? I told
her that I could Name it the better to her,
because I had been married myself since I part∣ed
from her: Yes Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> but the Case
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
alters, the Crime being on my Side, I ought not
to Marry; but, <HI>says she,</HI> that is not the Reason at
all, but I cannot do it; I pretended to press her
to it, (tho' not sincerely I must acknowledge, for
my heart had turned toward her for some time,
and I had fully forgiven her in my Mind all her
former Conduct) but, I say, I seem'd to press her
to it, at which she burst out in a Passion, no, no,
<HI>says she,</HI> let me be your Slave rather than the best
Man's Wife in the World: I reason'd with her up∣on
her Circumstances, and how such a Marriage
would restore her to a State of Ease and Plenty,
and none in the World might ever know or sus∣pect
who or what she had been, but she could
not bear it; but with Tears again raising her
Voice, that I was affraid she would be heard. I
beseech you, <HI>says she,</HI> do not speak it any more,
I was once yours, and I will never belong to any
Man else in the World; let me be as I am, or a∣ny
thing else you please to make me, but not a
Wife, to any Man alive but yourself.</P>
<P>I was so mov'd with the Passion, she was in at
speaking this, that I knew not what I said or did
for sometime, at length, I said to her, it is great
pity, you had not long ago been as sincere as you
are now; it had been better for us both; however,
as it is, you shall not be forc'd to any thing against
your Mind; nor shall you be the worse treated
for refusing. But how will you put him off? no
doubt he expects you will receive his Proposal, as
an Advantage, and as he sees no farther into your
Circumstances; so it is. O, Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> I have
done all that already; he has his Answer, and is
fully satisfy'd; he will never trouble you any more
on that Head, and then she told me what answer
she had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="343"/>
FROM that minute I resolv'd that I would
certainly take her again to be my Wife as before,
I thought she had fully made me amends for
her former ill Conduct, and she deserv'd to be
forgiven; and so indeed she did, if ever Woman
did, considering also, what dreadful Pennance she
had undergone, and how long she had liv'd in Mi∣sery
and Distress; and that Providence had, as it
were cast her upon me again, and above all, had
given her such an Affection to me, and so resolv'd
a Mind that she could refuse so handsome an offer
of Deliverance, rather than be farther separated
from me.</P>
<P>AS I resolved this in my Mind, so I thought
it was cruel to conceal it any longer from her;
nor indeed, could I contain my self any longer,
but I took her in my Arms; well, <HI>says I,</HI> you
have given me such a Testimony of Affection in
this, that I can no longer withstand; I forgive
you all that ever was between us on this Ac∣count,
and since you will be no Body's but
mine, you shall be mine again, as you were
at first.</P>
<P>BUT this was too much for her the other
way, and now she was so far over-come with
my yielding to her, that had she not got
Vent to her Passion by the most Vehe∣ment
Crying, she must have dy'd in my Arms,
and I was forc'd to let her go, and set her down
in a Chair, where she cry'd for a Quarter of
an Hour, before she could speak a Word.</P>
<P>WHEN she was come to her self enough to
talk again, I told her we must consider of a
Method how to bring this to pass; and that it
must not be done by publishing there, that she
was my Wife before, for that would expose us
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
both, but that I would openly marry her again;
this she agreed was very rational, and according∣ly,
about two Months after, we were marry'd
again, and no Man in the World ever enjoy'd a
better Wife, or liv'd more happy than we both
did for several Years after.</P>
<P>AND now I began to think my Fortunes were
settled for this World, and I had nothing before
me, but to finish a Life of infinite Variety, such
as mine had been with a comfortable Retreat, be∣ing
both made wiser by our Sufferings and Diffi∣culties,
and able to judge for our selves, what
kind of Life would be best adapted to our pre∣sent
Circumstances, and in what Station we
might look upon our selves to be most compleat∣ly
happy.</P>
<P>BUT Man is a short sighted Creature at best,
and in nothing more than in that of fixing his
own Felicity; or, <HI>as we may say,</HI> choosing for
himself: One would have thought, and so my
Wife often suggested to me, that the State of
Life that I was now in, was as perfectly calcu∣lated
to make a Man compleatly happy, as any
private Station in the World could be: We had
an Estate more than sufficient, and daily en∣creasing,
for the supporting any State or Figure
that in that Place we could propose to our selves,
or even desire to live in: We had every thing
that was Pleasant and agreeable, without the
least Mortification in any Circumstances of it;
every sweet thing, and nothing to embitter it;
every Good, and no mixture of Evil with it;
nor any Gap open, where we could have the
least apprehensions of any Evil breaking out upon
us; nor indeed, was it easie for either of us in
our most phlegmatick melancholly Notions, to
<PB N="339" REF="345"/>
have the least Imagination how any thing dis∣sastrous
could happen to us in the common Course
of Things, unless something should be fall us
out of the ordinary way of Providence, or of
its actings in the World.</P>
<P>BUT an unseen Mine blew up all this apparent
Tranquility at once, and tho' it did not remove
my Affairs there from me, yet it effectually
remov'd me from them, and sent me a wandring
into the World again; a Condition full of Ha∣zards,
and always attended with Circumstances
dangerous to Mankind, while he is left to choose
his own Fortunes, and be guided by his own
short sighted Measures.</P>
<P>I must now return to a Circumstance of my
History, which had been past for some Time,
and which relates to my Conduct, while I was
last in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I mention'd how my faithful Wife <HI>Moggy,</HI>
with her Tears, and her Entreaties had prevail'd
with me not to play the Mad-man, and openly
joyn in the Rebellion with the late Lord <HI>Derwent∣water,</HI>
and his Party, when they enter'd <HI>Lancashire;</HI>
and thereby, <HI>as I may say,</HI> sav'd my Life. But my
Curiosity prevail'd so much at last, that I gave her
the Slip when they came to <HI>Preston,</HI> and at least
thought I would go and look at them, and see
what they were likely to come to.</P>
<P>MY former Wife's importunities, <HI>as above,</HI> had
indeed prevail'd with me from publickly em∣barking
in that Enterprise and joyning openly,
with them in Arms; and by this, as I have ob∣serv'd,
she sav'd my Life to be sure, because I
had then publickly espoused the Rebellion,
and had been known to have been among
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
them, which might have been as fatal to me
afterwards, tho' I had not been taken in the
Action, as if I had.</P>
<P>BUT when they advanc'd, and came nearer
to us to <HI>Preston,</HI> and there appear'd a greater Spi∣rit
among the People in their Favour, my old
Doctor, who I had mention'd before, who was a
<HI>Romish</HI> Priest, and had married us, inspir'd me with
new Zeal, and gave me no rest, till he oblig'd me
with only a good Horse, and Arms to joyn them
the Day before they enter'd <HI>Preston,</HI> he himself
venturing in the same Posture with me.</P>
<P>I WAS not so publick here, as to be very well
known, at least by any one that had Knowledge
of me in the Country where I liv'd; and this
was indeed my safety afterward, as you will soon
hear; but yet I was known too among the
Men, especially, among the <HI>Scots,</HI> with some of
whom I had been acquainted in foreign Service;
with these I was particularly Conversant, and
passing for a <HI>French</HI> Officer: I talk'd to them
of making a select Detachment to defend the
Pass between <HI>Preston,</HI> and the River and Bridge;
upon maintaining which, as I insisted, depended
the safety of the whole Party.</P>
<P>IT was with some warmth that I spoke of that
Affair, and as I pass'd among them, <HI>I say,</HI> for a <HI>French</HI>
Officer, and a Man of Experience, it caus'd se∣veral
Debates among them; but the hint was
not follow'd, as is well known; and from that
Moment I gave them all up as lost, and medita∣ted
nothing but how to escape from them, which
I effected the Night before they were surround∣ed
by the Royal Cavalry: I did not do this with∣out
great difficulty, swimming the River <HI>Ribble,</HI>
<PB N="341" REF="347"/>
at a Place, where tho' I got well over, yet
I could not for a long while get to a Place
where my Horse cou'd land himself, <HI>that is
to say,</HI> where the Ground was firm enough
for him to take the Land; however, at length I
got on shoar, and riding very hard came the next
Evening in sight of my own Dwelling, here after
lying by in a Wood till the Depth of Night, I
shot my Horse in a little kind of a Gravel-pit, or
Marl-pit, where I soon cover'd him with Earth
for the present; and marching all alone, I came
about two in the Morning to my House, where
my Wife surpriz'd Joy, and yet terribly Frighted,
let me in, and then I took immediate Measures
to secure myself upon whatever incident might
happen, but which as things were ordered, I
had no need to make use of, for the Rebels being
intirely defeated, and either all killed, or taken
Prisoners. I was not known by any Body in
the Country to have been among them; no,
nor so much as suspected, and thus I made a
narrow Escape from the most dangerous Action,
and most foolishly embark'd in, of any that
I had ever been engag'd in before.</P>
<P>IT was very lucky to me, that I killed and
bury'd my horse, for he would have been taken
two Days after, and would to be sure have been
known by those who had seen me upon him at
<HI>Preston;</HI> but now, as none knew I had been a∣broad,
nor any such Circumstance could discover
me; I kept close, and as my Excursion had been
short, and I had not been miss'd by any of
my Neighbours, if any Body came to speak
with me, behold, I was at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="348"/>
HOWEVER, I was not thoroughly easy in my
Mind, and secretly wish'd I was in my own Do∣minions
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to which, in a little time,
other Circumstances concurring, I made Prepara∣tions
to remove with my whole Family.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, <HI>as above,</HI> the Action at
<HI>Preston</HI> happen'd, and the Miserable People sur∣render'd
to the King's Troops; some were execu∣ted
for Examples, as in such Cases is usual; and
the Government extending Mercy to the Multi∣tude;
they were kept in <HI>Chester</HI> Castle, and
other places a considerable time, till they were
disposed of, some one Way, some another, as
we shall hear.</P>
<P>SEVERAL hundreds of them after this, were
at their own Request transported, <HI>as tis vul∣garly
Express'd,</HI> to the Plantations, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
sent to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and other <HI>British</HI> Collonies, to
be sold after the usual manner of condemn'd
Criminals, or, <HI>as we call them there,</HI> Convicts, to
serve a limited Time in the Country, and then
be made Freemen again; some of these I have
spoken of above; but now to my no little Un∣casiness,
I found, after I had been there some
time, two Ships arrived with more of these Peo∣ple
in the same River where all my Plantations
lay.</P>
<P>I no sooner heard of it, but the first Step I
took was, to resolve to let none of them be bought
into my Work, or to any of my Plantations;
and this I did, pretending that I would not make
Slaves every Day of unfortunate Gentlemen, who
fell into that Condition, for their Zeal to their Par∣ty
only, and the like: But the true Reason was, that
I expected several of them would know me, and
might perhaps betray me, and make it publick,
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>
that I was one of the same sort, but had made
my Escape, and so I might be brought into Trou∣ble;
and if I came off with my Life, might
have all my Effects seiz'd on, and be reduc'd to
Misery and Poverty again at once, all which
I thought I had done enough to deserve.</P>
<P>THIS was a just Caution, but as I found
quickly, was not a sufficient one, as my Circum∣stances
stood, for my Safety; for tho' I bought
none of these poor Men my self, yet several of
my Neighbours did, and there was scarce a Plan∣tation
near me, but had some of them, more or
less among them; So that in a Word, I could
not peep abroad hardly, but I was in Danger to
be seen and known too, by some or other of
them.</P>
<P>I may be allow'd to say, that this was a very
uneasy Life to me, and such, that in short, I
found my self utterly unable to bear; for I was
now reduced from a great Man, a Magistrate,
a Governor, or Master of three great Planta∣tions;
and having three or four Hundred Ser∣vants
at my Command, to be a poor self con∣demn'd
Rebel, and durst not shew my Face;
and that I might with the same safety, or rather
more, have skulk'd about in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where
I was; or gone up to <HI>London,</HI> and conceal'd my
self there, till things had been over; but now
the Danger was come Home to me, even to my
Door, and I expected nothing, but to be inform'd a∣gainst
every Day, be taken up, and sent to <HI>England</HI>
in Irons, and have all my Plantations seiz'd on,
as a forfeited Estate to the Crown.</P>
<P>I had but one hope of Safety to trust to, and that
was, that having been so little a while among
them; done nothing for them; and passing for a
<PB N="344" REF="350"/>
Stranger, they never knew my Name, but only
I was call'd the <HI>French</HI> Colonel, or the <HI>French</HI>
Officer, or the <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, by most, if not,
by all the People there; and as for the Doctor
that went with me, he had found Means to es∣cape
too, tho' not the same way that I did, find∣ing
the Cause not like to be supported and that
the King's Troops were gathering on all sides
round them like a Cloud.</P>
<P>BUT to return to my self, this was no Sa∣tisfaction
to me, and what to do, I really knew
not; for I was more at a Loss how to Shift in
such a distress'd Case as this, now it lay so close
to me, than ever I was in any other Difficulty
of my Life. The first thing I did was to come
Home, and make a Confidence of the whole Af∣fair
to my Wife; and tho' I did it generously,
without Conditions, yet I did not do it, with∣out
first telling her, how I was now going to put
my Life into her Hands, that she might have it
in her Power to pay me Home, for all that she
might think had been hard in my former Usage
of her; and that in short, it would be in her
Power to deliver me up into the Hands of my
Enemies; but that I would trust her Gene∣rosity,
as well as her renew'd Affection, and
put all upon her Fidelity; and without any more
Precaution, I open'd the whole thing to her, and
particularly, the Danger I was now in.</P>
<P>A faithful Counsellor is Life from the Dead,
gives courage where the Heart is sinking, and
raises the Mind to a proper use of Means; and
such she was to me indeed, upon every Step of
this Affair; and it was by her Direction that I
took every Step that follow'd for the extricating
my self out of this Labrinth.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="351"/>
COME, come, my Dear, <HI>says she,</HI> if this be
all, there is no room for any such Disconsolate
doings as your fears run you upon; for I was
immediately for selling off my Plantations, and
all my Stock, and embarking myself forthwith,
and to get to <HI>Maderas,</HI> or to any Place out of the
King's Dominions.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife was quite of another Opini∣on,
and encouraging me on another Account,
propos'd two Things, either my Freighting a
Sloop with Provisions to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and so
taking Passage from thence to <HI>London,</HI> or letting
her go away directly for <HI>England,</HI> and endeavour
to obtain the King's Pardon whatever it might
cost.</P>
<P>I inclin'd to the last Proposal, for tho' I was
unhappily Prejudic'd in favour of a wrong Inte∣rest,
yet I had always a Secret, and right Noti∣on
of the Clemency, and merciful Disposition
of his Majesty, and had I been in <HI>England,</HI> should
I believe have been easily perswaded to have
thrown myself at his Foot.</P>
<P>BUT going to <HI>England,</HI> as I was, Circum∣stances
must have been a publick Action, and I
must have made all the usual Preparations for
it, must have appear'd in Publick, have staid till
the Crop was ready, and gone away in Form,
and State, as usual; or have acted as if something
extraordinary was the Matter, and have fill'd
the Heads of People there with innumerable Sug∣gestions
of they knew not what.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife made all this easie to me,
from her own Invention; for without acquaint∣ing
me with any thing, she comes merrily to
me one Morning before I was up; My dear,
<HI>says she,</HI> I am very sorry to hear that you are
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
not very well, this Morning; I have order'd <HI>Pen∣nico</HI>
that was a young <HI>Negro</HI> Girl, which I had
given her, to make you a Fire in your Cham∣ber,
and pray lye still where you are a while,
till 'tis done; at the same instant, the little
<HI>Negro</HI> came in with Wood, and a pair of Bellows,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to kindle the Fire and my Wife not gi∣ving
me time to reply, Whispers close to my
Ear to lye still, and say nothing till she came
up again to me.</P>
<P>I WAS thoroughly frighted, that you may be
sure of, and thought of nothing, but of being
discover'd, betray'd, carried to <HI>England,</HI> hang'd,
quarter'd, and all that was terrible, and my very
Heart sunk within me; she perceiv'd my Dis∣order,
and turn'd back, assuring me there was no
Harm, desir'd me to be easie, and she would come
back again presently, and give me satisfaction
in every particular that I could desire; so I
compos'd myself a while as well as I could; but
it was but a little while that I could bear it, and
I sent <HI>Pennico</HI> down Stairs to find out her Mi∣stress,
and tell her I was very Ill, and must speak
with her immediately, and the Girl was scarce
out of the Room before I jump'd out of Bed, and
began to dress me, that I might be ready for all
Events.</P>
<P>MY Wife was as good as her Word, and was
coming up as the Girl was coming down; I see,
<HI>says she,</HI> you want Patience, but pray do not
want Government of yourself, but take that
Skreen before your Face, and go to the Window,
and see if you know any of those <HI>Scotsmen,</HI> that
are in the Yard, for there are seven or eight of
them, come about some Business to your Clerk.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353"/>
I went and look'd through the Skreen, and
saw the Faces of them all distinctly, but could
make nothing of them, other than than that they
were <HI>Scotsmen,</HI> which it was easie to discern;
however, it was no satisfaction to me that I knew
not their Faces, for they might know mine for
all that, according to the old <HI>English</HI> Proverb, <HI>that
more knows</HI> Tom <HI>Fool, than</HI> Tom <HI>Fool knows;</HI> so
I kept close in my Chamber, till I understood
they were all gone.</P>
<P>AFTER this, my Wife caus'd it to be given
out in the House, that I was not well, and when
this not being well, had lasted three or four
Days, I had my Leg wrap'd up in a great piece
of Flannel, and laid upon a Stool, and there I
was lame of the Gout; and this serv'd for about
six Weeks, when my Wife told me she had given
it out, that my Gout was rather Rheumatick,
than a settled Gout, and that I was resolv'd to
take one of my own Sloops, and go away to
<HI>Nevis</HI> or <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and use the Hot Baths there for
my Cure.</P>
<P>ALL this was very well, and I approv'd my
Wife's contrivance, as admirably good, both to
keep me within Doors, eight or ten Weeks at first,
and to convey me away afterwards without any
extraordinary Bustle to be made about it; but still
I did not know what it all tended to, and what
the Design of it all was; but as my Wife desir'd
me to leave that to her, so I readily did, and
she carried it all on with a Prudence not to
be disputed; and after she had wrapt my Legs in
Flannel almost three Months, she came and told
me the Sloop was ready; and all the Goods put
on Board: And now, my Dear, <HI>says she,</HI> I come
to tell you all the rest of my Design; for ad∣ded
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
she, I hope you will not think I am going
to kidnap you, and transport you from <HI>Virginia</HI>
as other People are transported to it; or, that I
am going to get you sent away, and leave my∣self
in Possession of your Estate; But you shall
find me the same faithful humble Creature, which
I should have been, if I had been still your
Slave, and not had any Hopes of being your
Wife; and that in all my Scheme which I have
laid for your Safety, in this new Exigence, I
have not proposed your going one Step, but
where I shall go, and be always with you, to
assist, and serve you on all Occasions, and to
take my Portion with you, of what kind soever
our Lot may be.</P>
<P>THIS was so generous, and so handsome a
Declaration of her Fidelity, and so great a To∣ken
too of the Goodness of her Judgement, in
considering of the Things which were before her,
and of what my present Circumstances called
for, that from that time forward, I gave my
self chearfully up to her Management, with∣out
ony Hessitation in the least, and in about
ten Days Preparation, we embark'd in a large
Sloop of my own of about Sixty Ton.</P>
<P>I should have mention'd here, that I had still
my faithful Tutor, (as I called him) at the Head
of my Affairs, and as he knew who to Correspond
with, and how to mannage the Correspondence
in <HI>England,</HI> we left all that part to him, as I had
done before; and I did this with a full Satis∣faction
in his Ability, as well as in his Inte∣grity;
it is true, he had been a little shagreen'd
in that Affair of my Wife, who, <HI>as I hinted be∣fore,</HI>
had marry'd me, after telling him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
Answer to his Solicitations, that she had a Hus∣band
a live.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this was litterally true, yet as it
was a Secret not fit to be open'd to him, I was
obliged to put him off with other Reasons, as
well as I could, perhaps not much to the Pur∣pose,
and perhaps, not much to his Satisfaction;
so that I reckon'd, he look'd on himself, as not
very kindly used several Ways.</P>
<P>BUT he began to get over it, and to be easy,
especially at our going away, when he found
that the Trust of every Thing was still left in his
Hands, as it was before.</P>
<P>WHEN my Wife had thus communicated eve∣ry
thing of the Voyage to me, and we began to
be ready to go off, she came to me one Morning,
and with her usual Chearfulness told me; she
now came to tell me the rest of her Mea∣sures,
for the Compleating my Deliverance, and
this was, that while we made this Trip, <HI>as she
call'd it,</HI> to the hot Springs at <HI>Nevis:</HI> She would
write to a particular Friend at <HI>London,</HI> who she
could depend upon, to try to get a Pardon for a
Person on Account of the late Rebellion, with
all the Circumstances which my Case was at∣tended
with, <HI>viz.</HI> of having acted nothing among
them but being three Days in the Place, and
while we were thus absent, she did not question,
but to have an Answer, which she would direct
to come so many Ways, that we would be sure
to have the first of it as soon as it was possible
the Vessels could go' and come; and in the
mean time, the Expence should be very small,
for she would have an Answer to the grand
Question first; Whether it could be obtain'd or
no, and then an account of the Expence of it,
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
that so I might Judge for my self, whether I
would Part with the needful Sum, or no, before
any Money was Disburss'd on my Account.</P>
<P>I could not but be thoroughly satisfy'd with her
Contrivance in this particular, and I had nothing
to add to it, but that I would not have her li∣mit
her Friend so strictly, but that if he saw
the way clear, and that he was sure to obtain it,
he should go thorough Stitch with it, if within
the Expence of two, or three, or four Hundred
Pounds, and that upon Advice of its being practi∣cable,
he should have Bills payable by such a
Person on Delivery of the Warrant for the thing.</P>
<P>To fortifie this I enclos'd in her Packet a Let∣ter
to one of my Correspondents, who I could
more particularly Trust, with a Credit for the
Money, on such and such Conditions; but the
Honesty and Integrity of my Wife's Corre∣spondent
was such, as prevented all the Ex∣pence,
and yet I had the wish'd for Security as if
it had been all paid, as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>ALL these things being fix'd to our Minds,
and all things left behind in good Posture of
Settlement as usual, we embark'd together, and
put to Sea, having the opportunity of an <HI>Eng∣lishman</HI>
of War being on the Coast in pursuit of
the Pyrates, and who was just then standing a∣way
towards the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and told us
he would see us safe, as far as <HI>New Providence,</HI>
or the <HI>Bahama Islands.</HI></P>
<P>AND now having fair Weather, and a plea∣sant
Voyage, and my Flannels taken off
of my Legs. I must hint a little, what Car∣go
I had with me; for as my Circumstances were
very good in that Country, so I did not go such
a Voyage as this, and with a particular reserve
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>
of Fortunes whatever might afterwards happen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
without a sufficient Cargo, for our Support, and
whatever Exigence might happen.</P>
<P>OU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sloop, <HI>as I said,</HI> was of about 60 or 70
Ton, and as Tobacco, which is the general Pro∣duce
of the Country was no Merchandize at <HI>Ne∣vis,
that is to say,</HI> for a great Quantity; so we
carried very little, but loaded the Sloop with
Corn, Pease, Meal and some Barrels of Pork, and
an excellent Cargo it was; most of it being the
Produce of my own Plantation; we took also a
considerable Sum of Money with us in <HI>Spanish</HI>
Gold, which was as above, not for Trade, but for
all Events; I also order'd another Sloop to be
hir'd, and to be sent after me loaden with the
same Goods, as soon as they should have Advice
from me that I was safe arriv'd.</P>
<P>WE came to the Latitude of the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>An∣tegoa,</HI>
which was very near to that of <HI>Nevis,</HI>
whether we intended to go, on the 18th Day af∣ter
our passing the Capes of <HI>Virginia;</HI> but had
no sight of the <HI>Island,</HI> only our Master said he
was very sure if he stood the same Course as he
then was, and the Gale held, I say he told me,
he was sure he should make the <HI>Island</HI> in less than
five Hours Sail; so he stood on fair for the <HI>Islands:</HI>
However, his Account had fail'd him, for we
held on all the Evening, made no Land, and
likewise all Night; when in the Gray of the
Morning we discover'd from the Topmast-head, a
Brigantine, and a Sloop making Sail after us, at
the distance of about six Leagues, fair Weather,
and the Wind fresh at S. E.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358"/>
OUR Master soon understood what they were,
and came down into the Cabbin to me, to let me
know it; I was much surpriz'd you may be sure
at the Danger, but my poor Wife took me off
of all the Concern for myself to take care of her,
for she was frighted to that degree, that I
thought we should not have been able to keep
Life in her.</P>
<P>WHILE we were thus under the first Hurry,
and Surprize of the thing, suddenly another
Noise from the Deck call'd us up to look out, and
that was <HI>Land, Land;</HI> the Master, and I, (for by
this time I had gotten out of my Cabbin) run upon
the Deck, and there we saw the state of our Case
very plain; the two Rogues that stood after us,
laid on all the Canvas they could carry, and
crowded after us a main; but at the distance, as I
have said, of about six Leagues, rather more than
less; on the other Hand, the Land discover'd lay
about nine Leagues right a Head; so that if the
Pyrates could get of us, so as to sail three Foot
for our two, it was evident they would be up
with us, before we could make the <HI>Island,</HI> if not,
we should escape them, and get in; but even
then we had no great hope to do any more, than
run the Ship a Shoar to save our Lives, and so
stranding our Vessel, spoil both Sloop and Cargo.</P>
<P>WHEN we were making this Calculation,
our Master came in chearfully, and told me he
had crowded on more Sail, and found the Sloop
carried it very well, and that he did not find the
Rogues gain'd much upon us, and that especi∣ally,
if one of them did not, that was the Sloop
he found he could go away from the Brigantine,
as he pleas'd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thus we gave them what they call
a steern Chase, and they work'd hard to come up
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
with us, till towards Noon, when on a sudden
they both stood away, and gave us over, to our
great satisfaction, you may be sure.</P>
<P>WE did not it seems so easily see the Occasion
of our Deliverance, as the Pyrate did, for while
we went spooning away large with the Wind, for
one of the <HI>Islands, with those two Spurs in our Heels;</HI>
that is, with these two Thieves at our Sterns:
There lay an <HI>Englishman</HI> of War in the Road of
<HI>Nevis,</HI> which was the other <HI>Island</HI> from whence
they spy'd the Pyrates, tho' the Land lying be∣tween,
we could not see them.</P>
<P>As the Man of War discover'd them, she im∣mediately
slip'd her Cable, and put herself under
Sail in Chase of the Rogues, and they as soon per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d
her, and being to Windward, put themselves
upon a Wind to escape her; and thus we were
deliver'd, and in about an Hour more, we knew
who was our Deliverer, seeing the Man of War
stretch a Head clear of the <HI>Island,</HI> and stand di∣rectly
after the Pyrates, who now crowded from
us, as fast as they crowded after us before, and
thus we got safe into <HI>Antegoa,</HI> after the terrible
apprehension we had been in of being taken; our
Apprehensions of being taken now, were much
more than they would have been on Board a
loaden Ship, from, or to <HI>London,</HI> where the most
they ordinarily do, is to rifle the Ship, take what is
Valuable, and Portable, and let her go; but ours
being but a Sloop, and all our Loading being good
Provisions, such as they wanted to be sure, for
their Ships Store; they would certainly have
carried us away, Ship and all; taken out the
Cargo, and the Men; and perhaps, have set the
Sloop on Fire; so that as to our Cargo of Gold it
had been inevitably lost, and we hurry'd away,
no Body knows where, and us'd as such barbarous
<PB N="354" REF="360"/>
Fellows are wont to use such innocent People as
fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>BUT we were now out of their Hands, and
had the satisfaction a few Days after, to hear that
the Man of War pursu'd them so close, not∣withstanding
they chang'd their Course in the
Night, that the next Day they were oblig'd to
separate, and shift for themselves; so the Man
of War took one of them, namely, the Brigan∣tine,
and carried her into <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but, the
other (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Sloop, made her escape.</P>
<P>BEING arriv'd here, we presently dispos'd
of our Cargo, and at a tolerable good Price<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and now the Question was, what I should do next<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I look'd upon myself to be safe here from the
Fears I had been under of being discover'd as
a Rebel, and so indeed I was, but having been
now absent five Months, and having sent the
Sloop back with a Cargo of Rum, and Melasses,
such as I knew was wanting in my Plantations,
I receiv'd the same Vessel back in return loaden
as at first with Provisions.</P>
<P>WITH this Cargo my Wife received a Packet
from <HI>London,</HI> from the Person, who she had em∣ploy'd,
<HI>as above,</HI> to Solicit a Pardon, and who ve∣ry
honestly wrote to her, that he would not be
so unjust to her Friend, whoever he was, as to
put him to any Expence for a private Sollicita∣tion,
for that he was very well assur'd that his Ma∣jesty
had resolv'd, from his own native Disposition
to acts of Clemency and Mercy to his Subjects, to
grant a general Pardon, with some few Excepti∣ons
to Persons extraordinary, and he hop'd her
Friend was none of the extraordinary Persons to
be excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="361"/>
THIS was a kind of Life from the Dead to
us both, and it was resolv'd that my Wife should
go back in the Sloop directly to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where
she should wait the good News from <HI>England,</HI> and
should send me an Account of it as soon as she
receiv'd it.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY she went back, and came
safe with the Sloop and Cargo to our Plantation,
from whence after above four Months more Ex∣pectation,
behold! the Sloop came to me again
but empty, and gutted of all her Cargo, except
about 100 Sacks of unground Malt, which the
Pyrates (not knowing how to Brew) knew not
what to do with, and so had left in her: How∣ever,
to my infinite satisfaction, there was a
Packet of Letters from my Wife, with another
to her from <HI>England,</HI> as well one from her Friend,
as one from my own Correspondent; both of them
intimating that the King had sign'd an Act of
Grace, <HI>that is to say,</HI> a General Free Pardon, and
sent me Copies of the Act, wherein it was ma∣nifest
I was fully included.</P>
<P>AND here let me hint, that having now as it
were received my Life at the Hands of King
<HI>GEORGE,</HI> and in a manner so satisfying as
it was to me, it made a generous Convert of
me, and I became sincerely given in to the In∣terest
of King <HI>GEORGE;</HI> and this from a
Principle of Gratitude, and a Sense of my Obli∣gation
to his Majesty for my Life; and it has
continu'd ever since, and will certainly remain
with me as long as any Sense of Honour, and
of the Debt of Gratitude remains with me: I men∣tion
this to hint how far in such Cases Justice,
and Duty to our selves commands us; namely, that
to those who graciously give us our Lives, when
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
it is in their Power to take them away; those
Lives are a Debt ever after, and ought to be set
a part for their Service, and Interest as long as a∣ny
of the Powers of Life remain; for Gratitude
is a Debt that never ceases while the Benefit re∣ceiv'd
remains, and if my Prince has given me
my Life, I can never pay the Debt fully, unless
such a Circumstance as this should happen, that
the Prince's Life should be in my Power, and I as
generously preserv'd it; and yet neither would
the Obligation be paid then, because the Cases
would differ; thus, that my preserving the Life
of my Prince was my natural Duty, whereas the
Prince on his Side (my Life being forfeited to
him) had no Motive but meer Clemency, and Be∣neficence.</P>
<P>PERHAPS this Principle may not please all that
read it; but as I have resolv'd to guide my Actions
in things of such a Nature by the Rules of strict
Vertue and Principles of Honour; so I must lay
it down as a Rule of Honour, that a Man having
once forfeited his Life to the Justice of his
Prince, and to the Laws of his Country, and
receiving it back as a Bounty from the Grace of
his Soveraign; such a Man can never lift up his
Hand again against that Prince, without a for∣feiture
of his Vertue, and an irreparable Breach of
his Honour and Duty, and deserves no Pardon
after it, either from God or Man; but all this
is a Digression, I leave it as a Sketch of the Laws
of Honour, printed by the Laws of Nature in
the Breast of a Soldier, or a Man of Honour, and
which I believe all impartial Persons who under∣stand
what Honour means, will Subscribe to.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="363"/>
BUT I return now to my present Circum∣stances;
my Wife was gone, and with her, all my
good Fortune, and Success<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Business seem'd to
have forsaken me; and I had another Scene of
Misery to go thro', after I had thought that all
my Misfortunes were over, and at an End.</P>
<P>MY Sloop as I have told you arriv'd, but ha∣ving
met with a Pyrate Rogue, in the Gulph of
<HI>Florida,</HI> they took her first, then finding her
Cargo to be all Eatbles, which they always
want, they gutted her of all her Loading, except,
<HI>as I have said,</HI> about 100 Sacks of <HI>Malt,</HI> which
they really knew not what to do with; and
which was still worse, they took away all the
Men, except the Master and two Boys, who they
left on Board, just to run the Vessel into <HI>Antegoa</HI>
where they said they were Bound.</P>
<P>BUT the most valuable Part of my Cargo, <HI>viz.</HI>
a Packet of Letters from <HI>England,</HI> those they left
to my inexpressible Comfort and Satisfaction;
and particularly, that by those, I saw my Way
open to return to my Wife, and to my Planta∣tions,
from which I promised my self never to
wander any more.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I now embark'd my self,
and all my Effects on board the Sloop, resolving
to Sail Directly to the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> my
Capt. beating it up to reach the <HI>Bahama</HI> Channel,
had not been two Days at Sea, but we were over∣taken
with a violent Storm, which drove us so
far upon the Coast of <HI>Florida,</HI> as that we twice
struck upon the Shore, and had we struck a third
time, we had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inevitably lost. A Day or
two after that, the Storm abating a little, we
kept the Sea, but found that the Wind blowing
so strong against our passing the Gulph, and the
<PB N="316" REF="364"/>
Sea going so high, we could not hold it any
long<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; so we were forced to bear away, and
make what shift we could; in which distress, the
fifth Day after, we made Land, but found it to
be Cape—the <HI>North West</HI> part of the Isle
of <HI>Cuba:</HI> Here we found ourselves under a Ne∣cessity
to run in under the Land for Shelter, tho'
we had not come to an Anchor, so that we had
not touch'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Territories at all.
However in the Morning we were surrounded with
five <HI>Spanish</HI> Barks, or Boats, such as they call <HI>Barco
Longos,</HI> full of Men; who instantly boarded
us, took us, and carry'd us into the <HI>Havana,</HI> the
most considerable Port belonging to the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
in that Part of the World.</P>
<P>HERE the Sloop was immediately Seiz'd, and
in Consequence plundred, as any one that knows
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> especially in that Country, will
easily guess, our Men were made Prisoners and
sent to the common Goal, and as for my self,
and the Captain, we were carry'd before the <HI>Al∣cade
Major,</HI> or Intendant of the Place as Cri∣minals.</P>
<P>I spoke <HI>Spanish</HI> very well, having serv'd under
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and it stood me in
good stead at this time, for I so effectually ar∣gued
the Injustice of their Treatment of me,
that the Governor, or what I ought to call him,
frankly own'd they ought not to have stopp'd
me, seeing I was in the open Sea, persuing my
Voyage and offer'd no Offence to any Body, and
had not landed or offer'd to land upon any Part
of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty's Dominions, 'till I was
brought in as a Prisoner.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="365"/>
IT was a great Favour, that I could obtain
thus much, but I found it easier to obtain an Ac∣knowledgement
that I had receiv'd Wrong, than
to get any Satisfaction for that Wrong, and much
less was there any Hope or Prospect of Restitu∣tion:
And I was let know, that I was to wait,
till an Account could be sent to the Viceroy of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> and Orders could be received back from
him, how to act in the Affair.</P>
<P>I could easily foresee what all this tended to,
namely to a Confiscation of the Ship and Goods,
by the ordinary Process at the Place; and that my
being left to the Decision of the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI>
was but a pretended Representation of things to
him from the Corregidore or Judge of the Place.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I had no Remedy but the old
insignificant thing call'd Patience; and this I was
better furnish'd with, because I did not so much
value the Loss as I made them believe I did;
my greatest Apprehensions were, that they would
detain me, and keep me as a Prisoner for Life,
and perhaps send me to their Mines in <HI>Pern,</HI> as
they have done many, and pretended to do to all
that come on Shore in their Dominions, how
great soever the Distresses may have been which
have brought them thither, and which has been the
Reason why others who have been forc'd on Shore,
have committed all manner of Violence upon the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in their turn; resolving, however Dear
they sold their Lives, not to fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>BUT I got better Quarter among them, than
that too; which, was, <HI>as I have said,</HI> much of
it owing to my speaking <HI>Spanish,</HI> and to my
telling them how I had fought in so many Oc∣casions
in the Quarrel of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty,
in <HI>Italy,</HI> and by great good Chance, I had the
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
King of <HI>France</HI>'s Commission for Lieutenant Colo∣nel,
in the <HI>Irish</HI> Brigade in my Pocket, where it
was mention'd, that the said Brigade was then
serving in the Armies of <HI>France,</HI> under the Or∣ders
of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I fail'd not to talk up the Gallantry and per∣sonal
Bravery, of his Catholick Majesty on all
Occasions, and particularly in many Battles
where by the Way, his Majesty had never been
at all, and in some, where I had never been
my self; but I found I talk'd to People who
knew nothing of the Matter, and so any thing
went down with them, if it did but praise the
King of <HI>Spains,</HI> and talk big of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ca∣valry,
of which, God knows, there was not one
Regiment in the Army, at least while I was there.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this way of managing my self,
obtain'd me the Liberty of the Place, upon my
Parole, that I would not attempt an Escape;
and I obtain'd also, which was a great Favour,
to have 200 Pieces of Eight allow'd me out of
the Sale of my Cargo, for Subsistance, till I
could Negotiate my Affairs at <HI>Mexico;</HI> as for my
Men they were maintain'd as Prisoners, at the
publick Charge.</P>
<P>WELL, after several Months Solicitation and
Attendance, all I could obtain was, the Satis∣faction
of seeing my Ship and Cargo confiscated,
and my poor Sailors in a fair way to be sent to
the Mines: The last I begg'd off, upon Condi∣tion
of paying 300 Pieces of Eight for their
Ransom, and having them set on Shore at
<HI>Antegoa,</HI> and my self to remain Hostage for the
Payment of the said 300 Pieces of Eight, and
for 200 Pieces of Eight, which I had already
had, and for 500 Pieces of Eight more for my
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
own Ransom, if upon a Return from <HI>Mexico,</HI>
the Sentence of Confiscation, <HI>as above,</HI> should be
confirm'd by the Vice-roy.</P>
<P>THESE were hard Articles indeed, but I was
forced to submitt to them: Nor as my Circum∣stances
were above all such Matters as these, as
to Substance, did I lay it much to Heart; the
greatest Difficulty that lay in my Way was
that I knew not how to correspond with my
Friends in any part of the World, or which way
to supply my self with Necessaries, or with
Money for the payment I had agreed to: The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> being so Tenacious of their Ports, that
they allowed no Body to come on Shore, or, in∣deed,
near the Shore, from any Part of the
World, <HI>upon Pain of Seizure and Confiscation, as
had been my Case already.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Difficulty I began to Reason with
the Corregidore, and tell him, that he put things
upon us, that were impossible, and that were In∣consistent
with the Customs of Nations; that if
a Man was a Prisoner at <HI>Algiers,</HI> they would
allow him to write to his Friends to pay his
Ransom, and would admit the Person that brought
it to come and go free, as a publick Person,
and if they did not, no Treaty could be car∣ry'd
on for the Ransom of a Slave, nor the
Conditions be perform'd when they were agreed
upon.</P>
<P>I brought it then down to my own Case, and
desired to know, upon Supposition, that I might
within the Time limitted in that Agreement,
have the Sums of Money ready for the Ransom,
of my Men, and of my Self; how I should ob∣tain
to have Notice given me of it? Or, how it
should be brought, seeing the very Persons bring∣ing
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>
that Notice, or afterwards presuming to
bring the Money, might be liable to be seiz'd and
confiscated, as I had been, and the Money itself
be taken as a second Prize, without redeeming
the first.</P>
<P>THO' this was so reasonable a Request, that it could
not be withstood, in point of Argument, yet the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> shrunk his Head into his Shoulders, <HI>and
said,</HI> they had not Power sufficient to act in such
a Case; that the King's Laws were so severe
against the suffering any Strangers to set their
Foot on his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty's Dominions in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
and they could not dispence with the least
Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of them, without a particular Assiento, <HI>as
they called it,</HI> from the Consulado, or Chamber of
Commerce at <HI>Sevelle;</HI> or, a Command under the
Hand and Seal of the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>HOW Senior Corregidore <HI>said I,</HI> with some
Warmth, and as it were with Astonishment, have
you not Authority enough to sign a Passport for
an Agent, or Ambassador, to come on Shore here,
from any of the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Govern∣ours
in these Parts, under a white Flag, or Flag
of Truce, to speak with the Governour of this
Place, or with any other Person in the King's
Name, on the Subject of such Business as the
Governour may have to Communicate? why
said he, if you cannot do that, you cannot Act
according to the Law of Nations.</P>
<P>HE shook his Head, but still, said no, he
could not do even so much as that; but here one
of the Military Governours put in and oppos'd
him, and they two differ'd warmly; the first in∣sisting
that their Orders were defficient in that
particular; but the other said, that as they
were bound up to them, it could not be in their
<PB N="363" REF="369"/>
Power to Act otherwise, and that they was an∣swerable
for the ill Consequences.</P>
<P>WELL then, says the Governour to the Cor∣regidore,
now you have kept this <HI>Englishman</HI> as
Hostage for the Ransom of the Men, that you have
dismiss'd; suppose he tells you, the Money is rea∣dy,
either at such, or such, or such a Place; How
shall he bring it hither? you will take all
the People Prisoners that offer to bring it;
What must he do? if you say you will send and
fetch it? What Security shall he have, that he
shall have his Liberty, when it is paid you? and
why should he trust you so far, as to pay the
Money, and yet remain here a Prisoner.</P>
<P>THIS carried so much Reason with it, that the
Corregidore knew not what to say; but that so
was the Law, and he could Act no otherwise, but
by the very Letter of it; and here each was so po∣sitive,
that nothing could determine it, but ano∣ther
Express to be sent to the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this, the Governour was so kind, as to
say he would get me a Passport for any Body
that should bring the Money, and any Vessel they
were in by his own Authority, and for their safe
returning, and taking me with them, provided I
would answer for it; that they should bring no
<HI>European,</HI> or other Goods whatever with them,
and should not set Foot on Shoar without his ex∣press
Permission, and provided he did not
receive Orders to the contrary, in the mean
time from any superior Hand, and that even
in such a Case, they should have liberty to go
back freely from whence they came, under the
Protection of a white Flag.</P>
<P>I Bow'd very respectively to the Governour,
in Token of my acknowledging his Justice, and
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
hhen presented my humble Petition to him, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would allow my Men to take their own Sloop,
that it should be rated at a certain Value, and
would be oblig'd they should bring Specie on
Board with them, and that they should either pay
it for the Sloop or leave the Sloop again.</P>
<P>THEN he enquired to what Country I would
send them for so much Money, and if I could as∣sure
him of the Payment; and when he under∣stood
it was no farther than to <HI>Virginia,</HI> he seem'd
very easie, and to satisfie the Corregidore, who
still stood off, adhering with a true <HI>Spanish</HI> stif∣ness
to the Letter of the Law; the said Gover∣nour
calls out to me, Seignior, <HI>says he,</HI> I shall make
all this matter easie to you, if you agree to my
Proposal; your Men shall have the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sloop, on
Condition you shall bemy Hostage for her return;
but they shall not take her as your Sloop, tho' she
shall in the Effect be yours, on the Payment of
the Money; but you shall take two of my Men on
Board with you upon your Parole, for their safe
return, and when she returns, she shall carry his
Catholick Majesty's Colours, and to be enter'd as
one of the Sloops belonging to the <HI>Havana;</HI> one
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be Commander, and to be call'd
by such a Name as he should appoint.</P>
<P>THIS the Corregidore came into immediate∣ly,
and said, this was within the Letter of the
King's Commanderie or Precept, upon Conditi∣on,
however, that she should bring no <HI>European</HI>
Goods on Board. I desir'd it might be put in o∣ther
Words; namely, that she should bring no
<HI>European</HI> Goods on Shoar: It cost two days De∣bate
between those two, whether it should pass;
that no <HI>European</HI> Goods should be brought in
the Ship, or brought on Shoar; but having found
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
means to intimate that I meant not to Trade
there; but would not be tyed from bringing a
small Present to a certain Person in acknowledge∣ment
of favours, <HI>I say,</HI> after I had found
Room to Place such a hint Right, where it should
be Plac'd, I found it was all made easie to me,
and it was all agreed presently, that after, the
Ransom was paid, and the Ship also bought; it
was but reasonable, that I should have liberty
to Trade to any other Country, not in the
Dominions of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s; so to make
up my Losses; and that it would be hard to o∣blige
my Men to bring away the Vessel light,
and so lose the Voyage, and add so much to our
former Misfortunes; that so long as no Goods
were brought on Shore in the Country belong∣ing
to his Catholick Majesty's Dominions which
was all that they had to Defend, that the rest was
no business of theirs.</P>
<P>NOW I began to see my way thro' this un∣happy
Business, and to find that as Money would
bring me out of it; so Money would bring it to
turn to a good Account another way; wherefore
I sent the Sloop away under <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours, and
call'd her the <HI>Nuestra Segniora de la Val de Grace,</HI>
commanded by Segnior <HI>Giraldo de Nesma,</HI> one of
the two <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>WITH the Sloop I sent Letters to my Wife and
to my chief Manager with Orders to Load her
back, as I there directed (<HI>viz</HI>). That she should have
200 Barrels of Flower, 50 Barrels of Peas, and to
answer my other Views, I ordered 100 Bales to
be made up of all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Goods, such as
not my own Ware-houses only would supply, but
such as they could be supply'd with in other Ware∣houses,
where I knew they had Credit for any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="372"/>
IN this Cargo I directed all the richest, and
most valuable <HI>English</HI> Goods, they had, or could
get, whether Linnen, Woollen or Silk, to be made
up; the Courser things, such as we use in <HI>Virginia,</HI>
for Clothing of Servants, such I ordered to be
left behind, for the use of the Plantation: In less
than seven Weeks time the Sloop return'd, and
I that fail'd not every Day to look out for her
on the Strand, was the first that spy'd her at Sea
at a distance, and knew her by her Sails, but
afterwards more particularly by her Signals.</P>
<P>WHEN she return'd, she came into the Road
with her <HI>Spanish</HI> Antient flying, and came to an
Anchor, as directed; but I that had seen her some
Hours before, went directly to the Governour,
and gave him an Account of her being come,
and fain I would have obtain'd the Favour
to have his Excellence, <HI>as I call'd him,</HI> go on Board
in Person, that he might see how well his Orders
were executed, but he declin'd that; saying he
could not justifie going off of the <HI>Island,</HI> which
was, in short, to go out of his Command of the
Fort, which he could not re-assume without a new
Commission from the King's own Hand.</P>
<P>THEN I ask'd leave to go on Board myself,
which he granted me, and I brought on shoar with
me the full Sum in Gold, which I had conditi∣on'd
to pay for the Ransom, both of my Men
and myself, and for the Purchase of the Sloop;
and as I obtain'd leave to Land in a different
Place, so my Governour sent his Son with six Sol∣diers
to receive, and convey me with the Money
to the Castle, where he Commanded; and therein
to his own House: I had made up the Money in
heavy Parcels, as if it had been all Silver; and
gave it to two of my Men, who belong'd to the
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
Sloop, with Orders to them, that they should
make it seem by their carrying it to be much
heavier than it was; this was done to conceal
three Parcels of Goods, which I had pack'd up
with the Money to make a Present to the Go∣vernour
as I intended.</P>
<P>WHEN the Money was carried in, and laid
down on a Table; my Governour order'd the
Men to withdraw, and I gave the Soldiers each
of them a Peice of Eight to Drink, for which
they were very thankful, and the Governour
seem'd well pleas'd with it also: Then I ask'd
him pleasantly if he would please to receive the
Money, he said, no, he would not receive it, but in
presence of the Corregidore, and the other Peo∣ple
concern'd; then I beg'd his Excellency, <HI>as
I call'd him,</HI> give me leave to open the Parcels
in his Presence, for that I would do myself the
Honour to acknowledge his Favours in the best
manner I could.</P>
<P>HE told me, no, he could not see any thing
be brought on Shoar, but the Money, but if I
had brought any thing on Shoar for my own use,
he would not be so strict to enquire into that,
so I might do what I pleas'd myself.</P>
<P>UPON that I went into the Place, shut my
self in, and having open'd all things and placed
them to my Mind: There was five little Parcels,
as follows,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. 2. A piece of 20 Yards fine <HI>English</HI> Broad-Cloth,
5 yds Black, 5 yds Crimson in
one Parcel, and the rest of fine Mixtures
in another Parcel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A piece 30 Ells of fine <HI>Holland</HI> Linnen.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="368" REF="374"/>
4. A Piece of 18 yds fine <HI>English</HI> brocaded Silk.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A Piece of black <HI>Colchester</HI> Bays.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>AFTER I had plac'd these by themselves, I
found means with some seeming difficulties, and
much Grimace, to bring him to know that this was
intended for a Present to himself: After all that
Part was over, and he had seem'd to accept them,
signified, after walking a hundred Turns and
more in the Room by them, by throwing his Had
which was under his Arm, upon them, and making
a very stiff Bow, <HI>I say,</HI> after this, he seem'd to
take his leave of me, for a while, and I waited
in an Outer-Room, when I was call'd in again;
I found that he had look'd over all the parti∣culars,
and caus'd them to be remov'd out of
the Place.</P>
<P>BUT when I came again, I found him quite
another Man; he thank'd me for my Present, told
me it was Present fit to be given to a Viceroy of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> rather than to a meer Governour of a
Fort, that he had done me no Services suitable to
such a Return, but that he would see it he could
not oblige me farther before I left the Place.</P>
<P>AFTER our Compliments were over, I ob∣tain'd to
have the Corregidore sent for, who ac∣cordingly
came, and in his Presence the Money
stipulated for the Ransome of the Ship, and of the
Men was paid.</P>
<P>BUT here the Corregidore shew'd that he
would be as severely just on my Side, as on theirs,
for he would not admit the Money as a Ransom
for us as Prisoners, but as a deposite for so much
as we were to be Ransom'd for, if the Sentence
for our being made Prisoners should be con∣firm'd.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="375"/>
AND then the Governour and Corregidore
joyning together sent a Representation of the
whole Affair, at least we were told so to the Vice∣roy
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and it was privately hinted to me,
that I would do well to stay for the Return of
the <HI>Aviso,</HI> that is a Boat which they sent over
the <HI>Bay</HI> to <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> with an Express to <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI>
whose return is generally perform'd in two
Months.</P>
<P>I WAS not unwilling to stay, having secret
Hints given me, that I should find some way, to
go with my Sloop towards <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> myself,
where I might have an occasion to Trade pri∣vately,
for the Cargo which I had on Board;
but it came about a nearer way, for about tow
Days after this Money being deposited, <HI>as above;</HI>
the Governours Son invited himself on Board
my Sloop, where I told him I would be very
glad to see him, and whether at the same time
he brought with him three considerable Mer∣chants
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> Two of them not Inhabitants
of the Place.</P>
<P>WHEN they were on Board, they were very
Merry and Pleasant, and I treated them so much
to their satisfaction, that in short, they were not
very well able to go on Shoar for that Night, but
were content to take a Nap on some Carpets,
which I caus'd to be spread for them, and that
the Governour's Son might think himself well
us'd, I brought him a very good Silk Night-Gown,
with a Crimson Velvet Cap to lye down in, and
in the Morning desir'd him to accept of them for
his use, which he took very kindly.</P>
<P>DURING that merry Evening one of the Mer∣chants
not so touch'd with Drink as the young
Gentleman, nor so, as not to mind what it was
<PB N="370" REF="376"/>
he came about; takes an occasion to withdraw
out of the Great Cabbin, and enter into a Par∣lee
with the Master of the Sloop, in order to
Trade for what <HI>European</HI> Goods we had on Board;
the Master took the Hint, and gave me Notice of
what had pass'd, and I gave him Instructions
what to say, and what to do, according to which
Instructions they made, but few Words for about
5000 Peices of Eight's, and carried the Goods
away themselves, and at their own hazards.</P>
<P>THIS was very agreeable to me, for now I
began to see I should lick my self whole, by the
Sale of this Cargo, and should make my self full
amends of <HI>Jack Spaniard,</HI> for all the injuries he
had done me in the first of these things; with this
View I gave my Master, or Captain of the Sloop
Instructions for Sale of all the rest of the
Goods, and left him to manage by himself, which
he did so well, that he sold the whole Cargo the
next Day to the three <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with this ad∣ditional
Circumstance, that they desir'd the
Sloop might carry the Goods, as they were
on Board, to such Part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> as
they should appoint between the <HI>Houduras</HI> and
the Coast of <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>It was difficult for me to make good this Part
of the Bargain, but finding the Price agreed for,
would very well answer the Voyage, I consent∣ed;
but then how to send the Sloop away, and
remain among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when I was now a
clear Man, this was a difficulty too, as it was also
to go away, and not wait for a favourable Answer
from the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to the Representa∣tion
of the Governor and the Corregidore; how∣ever
at last, I resolv'd to go in the Sloop fall out
what would, so I went to the Governor and re∣presented
<PB N="371" REF="377"/>
to him, that being now to expect a fa∣vourable
Answer from <HI>Mexico,</HI> it would be a great
Loss to me to keep the Sloop there all the while,
and I desir'd his leave for me to go with the
Sloop to <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to sell and dispose of the Cargo,
which He well knew I was oblig'd not to
bring on shoar there at the <HI>Havana,</HI> and which
would be in Danger of being spoil'd by lying so
long on Board.</P>
<P>THIS I obtain'd readily with License to come
again into the Road, and (for myself only) to
come on shoar, in order to hear the Viceroy's plea∣sure
in my Case, which was depending.</P>
<P>HAVING thus obtain'd a License at, or
Passport for the Sloop and myself, I put to Sea
with the three <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants on Board with me;
they told me, they did not live at the <HI>Havana,</HI> but
it seems one of them did; and some rich Merchants
of the <HI>Havana,</HI> or of the Parts thereabouts in
the same <HI>Island</HI> were concern'd with them, for
they brought on Board that Night we put to Sea
a great Sum of Money in Peices of Eight, and
as I understood afterwards that these Merchants
bought the Cargo of me, and tho' they gave me
a very great Price for every thing, yet that they
sold them again to the Merchants, who they pro∣cur'd
on the Coast of <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> at a prodigious
Advantage; so that they got above a Hundred
<HI>per Cent</HI> after I had gain'd very sufficiently be∣fore.</P>
<P>WE sail'd from the <HI>Havana</HI> directly for <HI>Vera
Cruz,</HI> I scrupl'd venturing into the Port at first,
and was very uneasie, least I should have another
<HI>Spanish</HI> Trick put upon me; but as we sail'd un∣der
<HI>Spanish</HI> Colours, they shew'd us such Authen∣tick
<PB N="372" REF="378"/>
Papers from the proper Officers, that there
was no room to fear any thing.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, when we came in sight of the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Coast, I found that they had a secret
clandestine Trade to carry on, which tho' it was
Secret, yet they knew the way of it so well, that
it was but a meer Road to them. The Case was
this, we stood in close under shoar in the Night,
about six Leagues to the North of the Port, where
two of the Three Merchants went on shoar in
the Boat, and in three Hours, or thereabouts they
came on shoar again with five Canoes, and seven or
eight Merchants more with them, and as soon as
they were on Board; we stood off to Sea, so that
by Day-light we were quite out of sight of
Land.</P>
<P>I ought to have mention'd before, that as soon
as we were put out to Sea from the <HI>Havana;</HI> and
during our Voyage into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which
was eight Days, we Rumag'd the whole Cargo,
and opening every Bale, as far as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mer∣chants
desired, we Traffick'd with them for the
whole Cargo, except the Barrels of Flower and
Peas.</P>
<P>THIS Cargo was considerable in itself, for my
Wife's account, or Invoyce drawn out by my
Tutor, and Manager, amounted to 2684 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI>
and I sold the whole, including what had
been sold in the Evening, when they were on
Board first, <HI>as I have said,</HI> for 38593 Peices of
Eight, and they allow'd me 1200 Peices of Eight
for the Freight of the Sloop, and made my Ma∣ster
and the Seamen very handsome Presents
besides, and they were well able to do this too,
as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="379"/>
AFTER we were gotten out of Sight of Land,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fell to their Traffick, and our three
Merchants open'd their Shop, <HI>as they might say,</HI> for
it was their Shop; as to me, I had nothing to do
with it, or with their Goods; they drove their
Bargain in a few Hours, and at Night we stood
in again for the Shore, when the five Canoes
carry'd a great part of the Goods on Shore, and
brought the Money back in Specie, as well for
that they carry'd, as for all the rest, and at their
Second Voyage carry'd all away clear, leaving
me nothing on Board, but my Barrels of Flower
and Peas, which they bad me Money for too,
but not so much as I expected.</P>
<P>HERE, I found that my <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants
made above 70000 Peices of Eight of the Cargo
I had sold them; upon which, I had a great
Mind to be acquainted with those Merchants on
the <HI>Terra Ferma,</HI> who were the last Customers,
for it presently occurr'd to me, that I could easi∣ly
go with a Sloop from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and taking a
Cargo directed on purpose from <HI>England,</HI> of about
five or six thousand Pound, I might easily make
four of one; with this view, I began to make
a kind of an Acquaintance with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
which came in the Canoes, and we became so in∣timate,
that at last, with the Consent of the
three <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the <HI>Havana,</HI> I accepted an in∣vitation
on Shore to their House, which was a
little Villa, or rather Plantation, where they
had an <HI>Ingenio, that is to say,</HI> a Sugar-house, or
Sugar Work, and there they treated us like
Princes.</P>
<P>I took Occasion, at this Invitation, to say,
that if I knew how to find my way thither
again, I could visit them once or twice a Year,
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
very much to their Advantage, and mine too;
one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took the Hint; and taking me
into a Room by my self: Seignior, <HI>says he,</HI> if you
have any Thoughts of coming to this Place again,
I shall give you such Directions as you shall be
sure not to mistake, and upon either coming
on Shoar in the Night, and coming up to this
Place; or, upon making the Signals which we
shall give you, we will not fail to come off to
you, and bring Money enough for any <HI>Cargaison,
so they call it,</HI> that you shall bring.</P>
<P>I took all their Directions, took their Paroles
of Honour for my Safety, and without taking
any Notice to my first three Merchants, laid
up all the rest in my most secret Thoughts, resol∣ving
to visit them again in as short a time as I
could; and thus, having in about five Days
finished all our Merchandizing, we stood off to
Sea, and made for the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where I
set my three <HI>Spaniards</HI> a Shore, with all their
Treasure, to their Hearts Content, and made
the best of my way to <HI>Antegoa;</HI> where, with all
the Dispatch I could, I sold my 200 Barrels of
Flower; which, however, had suffer'd a little,
by the length of the Voyage; and having
laden the Sloop with Rum, Molasses, and Sugar,
I set Sail again for the <HI>Havana.</HI></P>
<P>I was now uneasy, indeed, for Fear of the
Pyrates, for I was a rich Ship, having besides
Goods, near 40000 Pieces of Eight in Silver.</P>
<P>WHEN I came back to the <HI>Havana,</HI> I went on
Shore, to wait on the Governour, and the Corre∣gidore,
and to hear what Return was had from
the Viceroy, and had the good Fortune to know
that the Viceroy had dissallow'd that part of the
Sentence which condemn'd us as Prisoners, and
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>
put a Ransom on us, which he insisted could
not be, but in time of open War; but as to the
Confiscation, he deferr'd it to the Chamber or
Council of Commerce at <HI>Sevil;</HI> and the Appeal
to the King if such be preferr'd.</P>
<P>THIS was in some Measure, a very good piece
of Justice in the Viceroy; for as we had not been
on Shore, we could not legally be imprisoned;
and for the rest, I believe, if I would have given
my self the Trouble, to have gone to old <HI>Spain,</HI>
and have preferr'd my Claim to both the Ship,
and the Cargo, I had recover'd them also.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as it was, I was now a free Man,
without Ransom, and my Men were also free, so
that all the Money which I had deposited, <HI>as a∣bove,</HI>
was return'd me; and thus I took my Leave
of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and made the best of my way for
<HI>Virginia,</HI> where I arriv'd, after a Year and a
half Absence, and notwithstanding all my Losses,
came Home above 4000 Pieces of Eight richer than
I went out.</P>
<P>As to the old Affair, about the <HI>Preston</HI> Priso∣ners,
that was quite at an End, for the general
Pardon, past in Parliament, made me perfectly
easy, and I took no more Thought about that
Part: I might here very usefully observe, how
necessary and inseperable a Companion, Fear is to
Guilt; it was but a few Months that the Face of
a Poor <HI>Preston</HI> Transport, would have frighted
me out of my Wits; to avoid them, I fain'd
my self Sick, and wrapt my Legs in Flannel,
as if I had the Gout; whereas now, they were
no more Surprize to me, nor was I any more un∣easy
to see them, than I was to see any other of
the Servants of the Plantations.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="382"/>
AND that which was more particular than all,
was, that tho' before I fancied every one of
them would know me, and remember me, and
consequently betray and accuse me; now, tho' I
was frequently among them, and saw most of
them, and if not all of them, one time or other;
nay, tho' I remember'd several of their Faces,
and even some of their Names, yet there
was not a Man of them, that ever took the
least notice of me, or of having known or seen
me before.</P>
<P>IT would have been a singular Satisfaction to
me, if I could have known so much as this of
them before, and had saved me all the Fatiegue,
Hazard, and Misfortune that befel me after∣wards;
but Man, a short sighted Creature,
sees so little before him, that he can neither
anticipate his Joys, nor prevent his Disasters,
be they at ever so little a Distance from him.</P>
<P>I had now my Head full of my <HI>West-India</HI> Pro∣ject,
and I began to make Provision for it according∣ly;
I had a full Account of what <HI>European</HI> Goods
were most acceptable in <HI>New Spain,</HI> and to add
to my Speed, I knew that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in
great want of <HI>European</HI> Goods; the Galleons from
<HI>Old Spain</HI> having been delay'd, to an unusual
length of Time, for the two Years before: Upon
this Account, having not time, as I thought, to
send to <HI>England</HI> for a Cargo of such Goods as
were most proper; I resolv'd to load my Sloop
with Tobacco, and with Rum, the last I brought
from <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and go away to <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Eng∣land,</HI>
and to <HI>New York,</HI> and see if I could pick up a
Cargo to my Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="383"/>
ACCORDINGLY, I took 20000 Pieces of Eight
in Money, and my Sloop laden, <HI>as above,</HI> and
taking my Wife with me, we went away; it was
an odd and new Thing at <HI>New-England,</HI> to have
such a Quantity of Goods bought up there by a
Sloop from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and especially to be pay'd
for in ready Money, as I did for most of my
Goods; and this set all the Trading Heads upon
the Stretch, to enquire what, and who I was; to
which, they had an immediate and direct Answer,
that I was a very considerable Planter in <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI>
and that was all, any of my Men on
Board the Sloop could tell of me, and enough
too.</P>
<P>WELL, it was the Cause of much Speculation
among them, as I heard at second and third
Hands; some said, he is certainly going to <HI>Ja∣maica;</HI>
others said, he is going to Trade with
the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> others, that he is going to the
<HI>South-Sea,</HI> and turn half Merchant, half Pyrate
on the Coast of <HI>Chily</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> some one thing,
some another, as the <HI>Men-Gossips</HI> found their Ima∣ginations
directed: But we went on with our Bu∣siness,
and lay'd out 12000 Pieces of Eight, be∣sides
our Cargo of Rum and Tobacco, and went
from thence to <HI>New-York,</HI> where we lay'd out the
rest.</P>
<P>THE chief of the Cargo we bought here, was
fine <HI>English</HI> Broad Cloath, Serges, Drugets, <HI>Nor∣wich</HI>
Stuffs, Bays, Says, and all kinds of Woollen
Manufactures, as also Linnen of all Sorts, a ve∣ry
great quantity, and near a thousand Pounds
in fine Sills of several Sorts.</P>
<P>BEING thus Freighted, I came back safe to <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI>
and with very little Addition to my Cargo,
began to prepare for my <HI>West-India</HI> Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="384"/>
I should have mention'd, that I had built up
on my Sloop, and raised her a little so that I had
made her carry Twelve Guns, and fitted her up
for Defence, for I thought she should not be at∣tack'd
and Boarded by a few <HI>Spanish</HI> Barco Longos,
as she was before; and I found the Benefit of it
afterwards, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>WE set sail the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> and as I
had twice been attack'd by Pyrates in passing
the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> or among the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands,
I resolv'd, tho' it was farther about to stand off
to Sea, and so keep as I believ'd it would be, out
of the way of them.</P>
<P>WE pass'd the Tropick, as near as we could
guess, just where the famous Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI>
fish'd up the Silver from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plate Wreck,
and standing in between the Islands, kept our
Course W. by S. keeping under the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI>
and so running away, Trade, as they call it, into
the Great Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> leaving the Island
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the S. and S. E. by this means a∣voiding,
as I thought, all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI>
or the <HI>Havana.</HI></P>
<P>As we pass'd the West Point of <HI>Cuba,</HI> three
<HI>Spanish</HI> Boats came off to Board us, as they had
done before, on the other Side of the Island; but
they found themselves mistaken, we were too
many for them, for we run out our Guns, which
they not did perceive before, and firing three or
four Shot at them, they retir'd.</P>
<P>THE next Morning they appear'd again, be∣ing
five large Boats, and a Bark, and gave us
Chase; but we then spread our <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours
and brought too to Fight them, at which they re∣tir'd,
so we escap'd this Danger by the addition
of Force which we had made to our Vessel.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="385"/>
WE now had a fair run our Port, and as
I had taken very good Directions, I stood away
to the North of St. <HI>John d' Ulva,</HI> and then run∣ing
in for the shoar found the Place appointed ex∣actly,
and going on shoar, I sent the Master of
my Sloop directly to the Ingenio▪ where he found
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant at his House, and where he
dwelt like a little Sovereign Prince, who welcome'd
him, and understanding that I was in a particu∣lar
Boat at the <HI>Creek,</HI> as appointed, he came im∣mediately
with him, and bringing another
<HI>Spaniard</HI> from a <HI>Villa</HI> not far off, in about four
Hours they were with me.</P>
<P>THEY would have perswaded me to go up to
their Houses, and have staid there till the next
Night, ordering the Sloop to stand off as usual
but I would not consent to let the Sloop go to Sea,
without me, so we went on Board directly, and as
the Night was almost run, stood of to Sea, so by
Day-break we were quite out of Sight of Land.</P>
<P>HERE we began, <HI>as I said</HI> before, to open
Shop, and I found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were extreamly
surpriz'd at seeing such a Cargo, I mean so large;
for in short, they had cared not if it had been four
times as much: They soon ran thro' the Contents
of all the Bales we open'd that Night, and with
very little Dispute about the Price they approv'd,
and accepted all that I show'd them; but as they
said they had not Money for any greater Parcel,
they agreed to go on shoar the next Evening
for more Mony.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we spent the remainder of the
Night in looking over, and making Inventories,
or Invoyces of the rest of the Cargo, that so they
might see the Goods, know the Value, and know
what more Money they had to bring.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="386"/>
ACCORDINGLY, in the Evening we stood in
for the shoar, and they carried part of the Cargo
with them, borrowing the Sloops Boot to assist
them, and after they had lodg'd, and Landed the
Goods, they came on Board again, bringing three
of the other Merchants with them, who were con∣cern'd
before, and Money enough to clear the
whole Ship, ay, and Ship and all, if I had been
willing to sell her.</P>
<P>To give them their Due, they dealt with me
like Men of Honour; they were indeed sensible
that they bought every thing much Cheaper of me,
than they did before of the three Merchants of the
<HI>Havana;</HI> these Merchants having been as it were
the Hucksters, and bought them first of me, and
then advanc'd, as I have said, above 100 <HI>per Cent</HI>
upon the Price they gave me; but yet at the same
time I advanc'd in the Price much more now, than
I did before to the said <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor was it with∣out
Reason, because of the length, and risque of
the Voyage, both out and home, which now lay
wholly upon me.</P>
<P>IN short, I sold the whole Cargo to them, and
for which I receiv'd near two Hundred Thousand
Pieces of Eight in Money, besides which, when
they came on Board the second time they brought
all their Boats loaden with fresh Provisions,
Hogs, Sheep, Fowls, Sweetmeats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enough
for my whole Voyage, all which they made a
Present to me of, and thus we finish'd our Traf∣fick
to our mutal Satisfaction, and parted with
Promises of farther Commerce, and with assu∣rances
on their part of all acts of Friendship, and
Assistance that I could desire, if any Disaster
should befal me in any of these Adventures; as
indeed was not improbable, considering the strict∣ness
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>
and severity of their Customs, in Case a∣ny
People were taken Trading upon their Coast.</P>
<P>I immediately call'd a Council with my little
Crew, which way we should go back; the Mate
was for beating it up to Windward, and getting
up to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but as we were too rich to run
any Risques, and were to take the best Course to
get safe Home, I thought, and so did the Master
of the Sloop, that our best way was to Coast a∣bout
the Bay, and keeping the shoar of <HI>Florida</HI>
on Board, make the shortest Course to the Gulph,
and so make for the Coast of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and to put
in there into the first Port we could, and wait
for any <HI>Englishmen</HI> of War that might be on the
Coast to secure us to the <HI>Capes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the best Course we could take, and
prov'd very safe to us, excepting that about the
Cape of <HI>Florida,</HI> and on the Coast in the Gulph,
till we came the height of St. <HI>Augustine;</HI> we were
several times visited with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Barco
Longos, and small Barks, in hope of making a
Prize of us; but carrying <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours, de∣ceiv'd
most of them, and a good Tire of Guns
kept the rest at a distance; so that we came
safe, tho' once or twice in Danger of being run
on shoar by a Storm of Wind; I say we came
safe into <HI>Charles</HI> River in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I found means to send a Letter
home, with an Account to my Wife of my good
Success and having an Account that the Coast was
clear of Pyrates, tho' there were no Men of War
in the Place, I ventur'd forward; and in short,
got safe into the Bay of <HI>Chesapeak,</HI> that is to say,
within the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and in a few days
more to my own House, having been absent three
Months, and four days.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="388"/>
NEVER did any Vessel on this side the World
make a better Voyage in so short a time, than I
made in this Sloop, for by the most moderate
Computation, I clear'd in these three Months five
and Twenty Thousand Pounds Sterling in ready
Money all the Charges of the Voyage to <HI>New-England</HI>
also being reckon'd up.</P>
<P>NOW was my time to have sat still contented
with what I had got; if it was in the power of
Man to know when his good Fortune was at the
highest; and more, my prudent Wife gave it as her
Opinion, that I should sit down satisfy'd, and
push the Affair no farther, and earnestly per∣swaded
me to do so; but I that had a Door open,
as I thought to immense Treasure, that had found
the way to have a Stream of the Golden Rivers of
<HI>Mexico</HI> flow into my Plantation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and
saw no hazards, more then what was common to
all such things in the Prosecution; <HI>I say</HI> to me,
these things look'd with another Face, and I
Dream'd of nothing but Millions and Hundred of
Thousands; so contrary to all moderate Measures,
I push'd on for another Voyage, and laid up a Stock
of all sorts of Goods that I could get together
proper for the Trade; I did not indeed go again
to <HI>New-England,</HI> for I had by this time a very
good Cargo come from <HI>England,</HI> pursuant to a
Commission, I had sent several Months before; so
that in short, my Cargo, according to the In∣voyce
now made up, amounted to above ten Thou∣sand
Pounds Sterling first Cost, and was a Cargo
so sorted, and so well bought, that I expected to
have advanc'd upon them much more in proporti∣on
than I had done in the Cargo before.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="389"/>
WITH these Expectations, we began our se∣cond
Voyage, in <HI>April,</HI> being about five Months
after our Return from the First; we had not indeed
the same good Speed, even in our Beginning, as
we had at first, for tho' we stood off to Sea about
60 Leagues, in order to be out of the Way of the
Pyrates, yet we had not been above five Days at
Sea, but we were visited and rifled by two Py∣rate
Barks, who being Bound to the <HI>Northward,
that is to say,</HI> the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> took
away all our Provisions, and all our Ammunition,
and small Arms, and left us very ill provided to
persue our Voyage; and it being so near Home,
we thought it advisable to come about, and stand
in for the Capes again, to restore our Condition,
and furnish our selves with Stores of all Kinds
for our Voyage; this took us up about 10 Days,
and we put to Sea again; as for our Cargo, the
Pyrates did not meddle with it, being all Bale
Goods, which they had no present Use for,
and knew not what to do with, if they had
them.</P>
<P>WE met with no other Adventure, worth
naming, till by the same Course that we had
steer'd before, we came into the Gulph of <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI>
and the first Misfortune we met with here,
was, that on the Back of <HI>Cuba,</HI> crossing towards
the Point of the <HI>Terra Ferma,</HI> on the Coast of
<HI>Jucatan,</HI> we had Sight of the Flota of <HI>New
Spain, that is,</HI> of the Ships which come from <HI>Car∣thagena</HI>
or <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> and go to the <HI>Havana,</HI>
in order to persue their Voyage to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THEY had with them one <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of
War, and three Frigats; two of the Frigats gave
us Chase, but it being just at the shutting in of the
Day, we soon lost Sight of them, and stand∣ing
<PB N="384" REF="390"/>
to the <HI>North</HI> cross the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> as if
we were going to the Mouth of <HI>Missisipi,</HI> they
lost us quite, and in a few Days more we made
the bottom of the Bay, being the Port we were
bound for.</P>
<P>WE stood in as usual, in the Night, and gave
Notice to our Friends, but in stead of their for∣mer
Readiness to come on Board; they gave us
Notice, that we had been seen in the Bay, and
that Notice of us was given at <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> and at
other Places, and that several Frigats were in
Quest of us, and that three more would be Crui∣sing
the next Morning in search for us.</P>
<P>WE could not conceive how this could be;
but we were afterwards told, that those three Fri∣gats,
having lost Sight of us in the Night, had
made in for the Shore, and had given the Allarm
of us, as of Privateers.</P>
<P>BE that as it would, we had nothing to do,
but to Consider what Course to take immediate∣ly,
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants Advice was very
good if we had taken it, namely, to have unla∣den
as many of our Bails as we could that very
Night, by the help of our Boat and their <HI>Canoes,</HI>
and to make the best of our Way in the Morn∣ing,
to the <HI>North</HI> of the Gulph, and take our
Fate.</P>
<P>THIS my Skipper, or Master, thought very
well of, but when we began to put it in Execution,
we were so confus'd, and in such a Hurry, being
not resolv'd what Course to take, that we could not
get out above sixteen Bales of all sorts of Goods,
before it began to be too light, and we behov'd
to set Sail; at last, the Master proposs'd a Medium,
which was that I should go on Shore in the next
Boat, in which was five Bales of Goods more,
<PB N="385" REF="391"/>
and that I should stay on shoar, if the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Merchants would undertake to conceal me, and
let them go to Sea, and take their Chance.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants readily undertook to
protect me, especially it being so easie to have
me pass for a natural <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and so they took
me on shoar with 21 Bales of my Goods, and the
Sloop stood off 10 Sea; if they met with any E∣nemies,
they were to stand in for the shoar the
next Night, and we fail'd not to look well out
for them, but to no purpose, for the next Day
they were discover'd and Chased by two <HI>Spanish</HI>
Fregates; they stood from them, and the Sloop
being an excellent Sailor gain'd so much that they
would certainly have been clear of them w'en
Night came on, but a small Picarcon of a Sloop
kept them Company in spight of all they could do,
and two or three times offe'd to Engage them,
thereby to give time to the rest to come up, but
the Sloop kept her way, and gave them a Chase
of three Days and Nights, having a fresh Gale
of Wind, at South West, till she made the <HI>Rio
Grand,</HI> or as the <HI>French</HI> call it the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> and
there finding no remedy, they run the Vessel on
shoar, not far from the Fort, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
call <HI>Pensacola,</HI> Garrison'd at that time with <HI>French;</HI>
our Men would have enter'd the River as a Port,
but having no Pilot, and the Current of the River
being strong against them, the Sloop run on shoar,
and the Men shifted as well as they could in
their Boats.</P>
<P>I was now in a very odd Condition indeed, my
Circumstances were in one Sense indeed very happy;
Namely, that I was in the Hands of my Friends,
for such really they were, and so faithful, that
no Men could have been more careful of their own
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
Safety than were they of mine, and that which ad∣ded
to the comfort of my new Condition, was the
produce of my Goods, which were gotten on
shoar by their own Advice and Direction, which
was a Fund sufficient to Maintain me with them
as long as I could be suppos'd to stay there; and, if
not the first Merchant to whose House I went,
assur'd me, that he would give me Credit for twen∣ty
Thousand Pieces of Eight, if I had occasion
for it.</P>
<P>MY greatest Affliction was, that I knew not
how to convey News to my Wife, of my present
Condition, and how among the many Misfortunes
of the Voyage I was yet safe, and in good
Hands.</P>
<P>BUT there was no remedy for this Part, but
the great universal Cure of all incurable Sorrows,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Patience, and indeed I had a great deal of
Reason, not for Patience only, but Thankfulness,
if I had known the Circumstances, which I should
have been reduc'd to, if I had fallen into the
Hands of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> the best of which that I
could reasonably have expected, had been, to have
been sent to the Mines, or which was ten Thou∣sand
times worse, the Inquisition; or if I had
escap'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as my Men in the Sloop
did, the Hardships they were expos'd to, the
Dangers they were in, and the Miseries they suffer∣ed,
were still worse, in wandering among Savages,
and the more Savage <HI>French,</HI> who plunder'd and
strip'd them, instead of relieving, and supplying
them in their long wilderness Journey over the
Mountains, till they reach'd the S. W. parts of
South <HI>Carolina.</HI> A Journey, which indeed deserves
to have an Account to be given of it by itself; <HI>I
say,</HI> all these things had I known of them would
<PB N="387" REF="393"/>
have let me see that I had a great deal of Reason,
not only to be Patient, under my present Cir∣cumstances
but satisfy'd, and thankful.</P>
<P>HERE, <HI>as I said,</HI> my Patron the Merchant
entertain'd me like a Prince, he made my safety
his peculiar Care, and while we were in any Ex∣pectation
of the Sloop being taken, and brought
into <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> he kept me retired at a little
House in a Wood, where he kept a fine <HI>Avery</HI> of
all sorts of <HI>American</HI> Birds, and out of which he
Yearly sent some as Presents to his Friends in old
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Retreat was necssary, least if the Sloop
should be taken, and brought into <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> and
the Men be brought in Prisoners, they should be
tempted to give an Account of me as their Super
Cargo, or Merchant, and where both I and the
21 Bales of Goods were set on shoar; as for the
Goods he made sure Work with them, for they
were all open'd, taken out of the Bales, and se∣parated,
and being mix'd with other <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which came by the Galeons, where made
up in new Package, and sent to <HI>Mexico</HI> in several
Parcels, some to one Merchant, some to another;
so that it was impossible to have found them out,
even if they had had Information of them.</P>
<P>IN this Posture, and in Apprehension of some
bad News of the Sloop, I remain'd at the Villa,
or House in the Vale, for so they call'd it, about
five Weeks; I had two <HI>Negroes</HI> appointed to wait
on me, one of which was my Purvor, or my
Cook, the other my Valet; and my Friend, the
Master of all came constantly every Evening to
Visit, and Sup with me, when we walk'd out to∣gether
into the <HI>Avery,</HI> which was of its kind, the
most beautiful thing that ever I saw in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="394"/>
AFTER above five Weeks retreat of this
kind, he had good Intelligence of the Fate of the
Sloop, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the two Fregates, and a Sloop had
Chas'd her till she ran on Ground near the Fort of
<HI>Pensacola,</HI> that they saw her strand'd and broke in
pieces by the force of the Waves, the Men making
their escape in their Boat. This News was brought
it seems by the said Fregates to <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI>
where my Friend went on purpose to be fully
inform'd, and receiv'd the Account from one of
the Captains of the Fregates, and discours'd with
him at large about it.</P>
<P>I was better pleas'd with the loss of the
Sloop, and all my Cargo, the Men being got a
Shoar, and escaping, than I should have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een
with the saving the whole Cargo, if the Men had
fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for now
I was safe, whereas then it being suppos'd
they would have been forc'd to some discovery a∣bout
me, I must have fled, and should have found it
very difficult to have made my Escape, even with
all that my Friends could have done for me too.</P>
<P>BUT now I was perfectly easie, and my
Friend, who thought confining me at the House in
the Vale, no longer needful, brought me publickly
home to his dwelling House, as a Merchant come
from old <HI>Spain,</HI> by the last Galeons, and who ha∣ving
been at <HI>Mexico</HI> was come to reside with him.</P>
<P>HERE I was dress'd like a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of the
better sort, had three <HI>Negroes</HI> to attend me, and
was call'd <HI>Don Ferdinand de Villa Moresa,</HI> in <HI>Casti∣lia
Veja, that is to say,</HI> in <HI>Old Castile.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I had nothing to do but to walk about,
and ride out into the Woods, and come home
again to enjoy the pleasantest, and most agree∣able
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
Retirement in the World; for certainly no
Men in the World live in such splendor, and wal∣low
in such immense Treasures, as the Merchants
of this Place.</P>
<P>THEY live, <HI>as I have said,</HI> in a Kind of Coun∣try
Retreat at their <HI>Villa's,</HI> or, as we would
call them, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> their Plantations, <HI>and as
they do call them,</HI> their <HI>Ingenio's,</HI> where they
make their Indigo, and their Sugars: but they
have also Houses, and Ware-houses, at <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI>
where they go twice a Year, when the Galeons
arrive from <HI>Old Spain;</HI> and when those Galeons
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lade for their return; and it was surprizing to
me, when I went to <HI>la Vera Cruz</HI> with them,
to see what prodigious Consignments they had
from their Correspondents in <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and with
what Dispatch they mannag'd them; for no
sooner were the Cases, Packs, and Bales of <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Goods brought into their Ware-houses, but
they were open'd, and repack'd by Porters, and
Packers of their own, <HI>that is to say,</HI> Negroes,
and <HI>Indian</HI> Servants; and being made up in∣to
new Bales, and separate Parcels were all
dispatch'd again, by Horses, for <HI>Mexico,</HI> and di∣rected
to their several Merchants there; and
the remainder carry'd home, <HI>as above,</HI> to the
<HI>Ingenio,</HI> where they liv'd, which was near 30
<HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> so that in about
20 Days, their Ware-houses were again entirely
free, at <HI>la Vera Cruz,</HI> all their Business was
over there; and they, and all their Servants re∣tir'd;
for they stay'd no longer there than needs
must, because of the unhealthiness of the Air.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="396"/>
AFTER the Goods were thus dispatch'd, it was
equally Surprizing, to see how soon, and with
what Exactness, the Merchants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to
whom those Cargoes were separately Consign'd,
made the Return, and how it came all in Silver,
or in Gold; so that their Ware houses, in a few
Months, were piled up, even to the Ceiling,
with Chests of Pieces of Eight, and with Bars
of Silver.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to describe in the narrow Com∣pass
of this Work, with what Exactness, and Or∣der,
and yet, with how little Hurry, and not
the least Confusion, every thing was done; and
how soon a Weight of Business of such Importance
and Value, was negotiated and finish'd, the Goods
repack'd, Invoyces made, and every thing dis∣patch'd
and gone; so that in about five Weeks,
all the Goods they had receiv'd from <HI>Europe,</HI> by
the Galeons were disposed of, and entered in
their Journals, to the proper Account of the Mer∣chant,
to whom they were respectively consign'd;
from thence they had Book-keepers, who drew
out the Invoyces, and wrote the Letters, which
the Merchant himself only read over, and Sign'd,
and then other Hands copy'd all again, into other
Books.</P>
<P>I can give no Estimate of the Value of the se∣veral
Consignments they receiv'd by that Flota;
but I remember, that when the Galeons went
back, they Ship'd on Board, at several Times,
one Million three hundred Thousand Pieces of
Eight, in Specie, besides 180 Bales or Bags of
Cochoneal, and about 300 Bales of Indigo; but
they were so Modest, <HI>that they said,</HI> this was for
themselves, and their Friends; <HI>that is to say,</HI> the
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
several Merchants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> consign'd large
Quantities of Bullion to them, to Ship on Board,
and consign according to their Order; but then
I know also, that for all that, they were allow'd
Commission, so that their Gain, was very consi∣derable,
even that way also.</P>
<P>I had been with them at <HI>la Vera Cruz,</HI> and came
back again before we came to an Account for
the Goods which I had brought on Shore, in the
21 Bales; which by the Account we brought them
to, leaving the Piece of every thing to be govern'd
by our last Market, amounted to 8570 Pieces of
Eight, all which Money, my Friend, <HI>for so I
must now call him,</HI> brought me in Specie, and
caused his <HI>Negroes</HI> to pile them up in one Corner
of my Apartment; so that I was indeed, still
very Rich, all things consider'd.</P>
<P>THERE was a Bale which I had caused to be
pack'd up on purpose in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and which in∣deed,
I had written for from <HI>England,</HI> being
chiefly of Fine <HI>English</HI> Broad Cloaths, Silk, Silk-Druggets,
and fine Stuffs of several Kinds, with
some very fine Hollands, which I set a part for
Presents, as I should find Occasion; and as what
ever Hurry I was in, at carrying the 21 Bales of
Goods on Shore, I did not forget to let this Bale be
one of them, so when we came to a Sale for the
Rest, I told them, that was a Pack with Cloaths
and Necessaries for my own Wearing and Use,
and so desired it might not be open'd with the
rest; which was accordingly observ'd, and that
Bale, or Pack was brought into my Apart∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="398"/>
THIS Bale, was in general, made up of seve∣ral
smaller Bales, which I had directed, so that I
might have Room to make Presents, equally
sorted as the Circumstance might direct me:
However, they were all considerable, and I
reckon'd the whole Bale cost me near 200 <HI>l. Ster∣ling,</HI>
in <HI>England;</HI> and tho' my present Circum∣stances
requir'd some Limits to my Bounty, in
making Presents, yet the Obligation I was under,
being so much the greater, especially, to this one
friendly Generous <HI>Spaniard;</HI> I thought I could not
do better than by opening two of the smaller Bales
joyn them together, and make my Gift some∣thing
suitable to the Benefactor, and to the Re∣spect
he had shewn me; accordingly, I took
two Bales, and laying the Goods together; the
Contents were as follows.</P>
<Q><P>TWO Pieces of fine <HI>English</HI> broad Cloth, the
finest that could be got in <HI>London,</HI> divided
as was that which I gave to the Governor at
the <HI>Havana,</HI> into fine Crimson in Grain, fine
light Mixtures, and fine Black.</P>
<P>FOUR Pieces of fine <HI>Holland,</HI> of 7<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s. per</HI>
Ell in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>TWELVE Pieces of fine Silk Drugget, and <HI>du
Roys,</HI> for Men's Ware.</P>
<P>SIX Peices of Broad Silks, 2 Damasks, 2 Bro∣caded
Silks, and 2 Mantuas.</P>
<P>WITH a Box of Ribbons, and a Box of Lace,
the last Cost about 40<HI>l. Sterling,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P></Q>
<P>THIS handsome Parcel I laid open in my Ap∣partment,
and brought him up Stairs one Morn∣ing,
on Pretence to drink <HI>Chocolate</HI> with me,
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
which he ordinarily did; when as we drank <HI>Cho∣colate,</HI>
and was merry, <HI>I said to him,</HI> tho I had
sold him almost all my Cargo, and taken his Mo∣ney;
yet the Truth was, that I ought not to
have sold them to him, but to have lay'd them
all at his Feet, for that it was to his Direction
I ow'd the having any thing sav'd at all.</P>
<P>HE smil'd, and with a great deal of Friend∣ship
in his Face, <HI>told me,</HI> that not to have paid
me for them, would have been to have plun∣der'd
a Shipwreck, which had been worse than to
have robb'd an Hospital.</P>
<P>AT last I told him, I had two Requests to
make to him, which must not be deny'd, <HI>I
told him,</HI> I had a small present to make to him,
which I would give him a Reason why he
should not refuse to accept: And the second
Request I would make after the First was grant∣ed.
He said he would have accepted any Present
from me, if I had not been under a Dissaster,
but as it was, it would be cruel and ungenerous.
But, <HI>I told him,</HI> he was oblig'd to hear my Rea∣son
for his accepting it: <HI>Then I told him,</HI> that
this Parcel was made up for him by Name, by
my Wife, and I, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and his Name set
on the Marks of the Bale, and accordingly, I
shew'd him the Marks, which was indeed, on
one of the Bales, but I had doubled it now, <HI>as a∣bove,</HI>
so that I told him these were his Own pro∣per
Goods; and in short, I press'd him so to re∣ceive
them, that he made a Bow, and I said no
more, but order'd my <HI>Negro, that is to say,</HI> his
<HI>Negro</HI> that waited on me, to carry them all ex∣cept
the two Boxes into his Apartments, but
would not let him see the Particulars, till they
were all carry'd away.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="400"/>
AFTER he was gone, about a Quarter of an
Hour, he came in raving, and almost swearing,
and in a great Passion, but I could easily see, he was
exceedingly pleased; and told me, had he known
the Particulars, he would never have suffer'd
them to have gone, as he did, and at last used the
very same Compliment, that the Governour at
the <HI>Havana</HI> used, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was a Present,
fit for a Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> rather than for him.</P>
<P>WHEN he had done, <HI>he then told me,</HI> he re∣member'd
I had two Requests to him, and that
one was not to be told till after the first was
granted, and he hoped now, I had something to
ask of him, that was equal to the Obligation I
had lay'd upon him.</P>
<P>I told him, I knew it was not the Custom in
<HI>Spain,</HI> for a Stranger to make Presents to the
Ladies; and that I would not in the least doubt,
but that whatever the Ladies of his Family re∣quir'd,
as proper for their Use, he would appro∣priate
to them as he thought fit. But that there
was two little Boxes in the Parcel, which my
Wife, with her own Hand had directed to the
Ladies; and I beg'd he would be pleas'd with his
own Hand to give them in my Wife's Name as
directed; that I was only the Messenger, but
that I could not be honest, if I did not discharge
the Trust repos'd myself of.</P>
<P>THESE were the two Boxes of Ribbands, and
Lace, which knowing the nicety of the Ladies in
<HI>Spain,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> about their Wo∣men
I had made my Wife pack up, and direct with
her own hand, <HI>as I have said.</HI></P>
<P>HE smil'd, and told me it was true, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
did not ordinarily, admit so much Free∣dom
among the Women, as other Nations; but
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
he hop'd, <HI>he said,</HI> I would not think the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
thought all their Women Whores, or that
all <HI>Spaniards</HI> where jealous of their Wive's: That
as to my Present, since he had agreed to accept
of it; I should have the Directing of what Part
I pleas'd to his Wife and Daughters; for he had
three Daughters.</P>
<P>HERE I strain'd Courtifies again, and told him
by No means, I would direct nothing of that
kind, I only beg'd that he would with his own
Hand present to his <HI>Donna,</HI> or Lady, the Present
design'd them by my Wife, and that he would
Present it in her Name now living in <HI>Virginia.</HI> He
was extreamly pleas'd with the nicety I us'd; and
I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saw him Present it to her accordingly, and could
see at the opening of it, that she was extreamly
pleas'd with the Present it self, as indeed, she
might very well be, for in that Country it was
worth a very considerable Sum of Money.</P>
<P>THO' I was us'd with an uncommon Friend∣ship
before, and nothing could well be desir'd
more, yet the grateful Sense I shew'd of it, in
the Magnificence of this Present was not lost, and
the whole Family appear'd sensible of it; so that
I must allow that Presents, where they can be
made in such a manner, are not without their in∣fluence,
where the Persons were not at all Merce∣nary,
either before or after.</P>
<P>I had here now a most happy, and comforta∣ble
Retreat, tho' it was a kind of an Exile;
here I enjoy'd every thing I could think of, that
was agreeable and pleasant, except only a Liberty
of going home, which for that Reason, perhaps
was the only thing I desir'd in the World; for
the grief of one absent Comfort is oftentimes
capable of inbittering all the other Enjoyments
in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="402"/>
HERE I enjoy'd the Moments which I had never
before known how to employ. I mean, that here
I learn'd to look back upon a long ill-spent Life,
bless'd with infinite Advantage, which I had no
Heart given me till now to make use of, and
here I found just Reflections were the unmost Fe∣licity
of human Life.</P>
<P>HERE I wrote these Memoirs having to add,
to the Pleasure of looking back with due Reflecti∣ons,
the Benefit of a violent Fit of the Gout,
which as it is allow'd by most People, clears
the Head, restores the Memory, and Qualifies
us to make the most, and just, and userul Re∣marks
upon our own Actions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, when I wrote these things down,
I did not foresee that the Writings of our own
Stories would be so much the Fashion in <HI>England,</HI>
or so agreeable to others to read, as I find Cu∣stom,
and the Humour of the Times has caus'd it
to be; if any one that reads my Story, pleases to
make the same just Reflections, which I acknow∣ledge,
I ought to have made; he will reap the be∣nefit
of my Misfortunes, perhaps, more than I
have done myself; 'tis evident by the long Series
of Changes, and Turns, which have appear'd in
the narrow Compass of one private mean Person's
Life, that the History of Men's Lives may
he many ways made Useful, and Instructing to
those who read them, if moral and religious Im∣provement,
and Reflections are made by those
that write them.</P>
<P>THERE remains many things in the Course
of this unhappy Life of mine, tho'I have left
so little a part of it to speak of that are worth
giving a large, and distinct Account of, and which
give Room for just Reflections of a Kind which I
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
have not made yet; particularly, I think it just
to add how in collecting the various Changes,
and Turns of my Affairs, I saw clearer than
ever I had done before, how an invisible over∣ruling
Power, a Hand influenced from above, Go∣verns
all our Actions of every Kind, limits
all our Designs, and orders the Events of every
Thing relating to us.</P>
<P>AND from this Observation it necessarily oc∣curr'd
to me, how just it was, that we should
pay the homage of all Events to him; that as he
guided, and had even made the Chain of Causes,
and Consequences, which Nature in general strict∣ly
obey'd, so to him should be given the Honour
of all Events, the Consequences of those Causes,
as the first Mover, and Maker of all Things.</P>
<P>I WHO had hitherto liv'd, as might be truly
said, <HI>without God in the World,</HI> began now to see
farther into all those Things, than I had ever yet
been capable of before, and this brought me at last
to look with shame and blushes, upon such a
Course of Wickedness, as I had gone through
in the World: I had been bred indeed to nothing
of either religious, or moral Knowledge; what
I gain'd of e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tner, was first by the little time of
civil Life, which I liv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where my
abhorrence of the wickedness of my Captain
and Comrade, and some sober religious Company
I fell into, first gave me some Knowledge of
Good and Evil, and shew'd me the Beauty of a
sober religious Life, tho' with my leaving
that Country, it soon left me too; or secondly,
the modest Hints, and just Reflections of my
Steward, who I call'd my Tutor, who was a Man
of sincere Religion, good Principles, and a re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="398" REF="404"/>
true Penitent for his past Miscarriages: O! had
I with him sincerely repented of what was pass'd,
I had not for 24 Year together liv'd a Life of
levity, and profligate Wickedness after it.</P>
<P>BUT here I had, <HI>as I said,</HI> leisure to reflect, and
to repent, to call to mind things pass'd, and with
a just Detestation, learn as <HI>Job</HI> says, <HI>to abhor my
self in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is with this Temper that I have written my
Story, I would have all that design to read it,
prepare to do so with the Temper of Penitents;
and remember with how much Advantage they
may make their penitent reflections at Home, under
the merciful Dispositions of Providence in Peace,
Plenty, and Ease, rather than Abroad under the
Discipline of a Transported Criminal as my Wife
and my Tutor, or under the Miseries and Distresses
of a Shipwreck'd wanderer, as my Skipper or
Captain of the Sloop, who as I hear dyed a very
great Penitent, labouring in the Deserts and
Mountains to find his way home to <HI>Virginia,</HI> by
the way of <HI>Carolina,</HI> whether the rest of the Crew
reached after infinite Dangers and Hardships;
or in Exile, however favourably circumstanciated
as mine, in absence from my Family, and for some
time in no probable View of ever seeing them
any more.</P>
<P>SUCH <HI>I say,</HI> may repent with Advantage,
but how few are they that seriously look in, till
their way is hedg'd up, and they have no other
way to look?</P>
<P>HERE, <HI>I say,</HI> I had Leisure to Repent, how far
it pleases God to give the Grace of Repentance
where he gives the Opportunity of it, is not for
me to say of myself, it is sufficient that I re∣commend
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>
it to all that read this Story, that when
they find their Lives come up in any degree to
any Similitude of Cases, they will enquire by me,
and ask themselves, Is not this the time to Repent?
perhaps the Answer may touch them.</P>
<P>I have only to add to what was then written,
that my kind Friend the <HI>Spaniards</HI> finding no o∣ther
Method presented for conveying me to my
home, that is to say, to <HI>Virginia,</HI> got a License,
for me to come in the next Galeons, as a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Merchant to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where I arriv'd safe with all
my Treasure, for he suffer'd me to be at no Ex∣pences
in his House; and from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> I soon got
Passage on Board an <HI>English</HI> Merchant Ship for
<HI>London,</HI> from whence I sent an Account of my
Adventures to my Wife, and where in about five
Months more, she came over to me, leaving with
full satisfaction the Management of all our Af∣fairs
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the same faithful Hands as
before.</P>
