<HEAD>DISTRESS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HERE <HI>Thames</HI> profuse, and lavish of his Charms,</L>
<L>In sportive Vein the silver Crescent forms,</L>
<L>His progress winding, softly glides along,</L>
<L>So softly glides, he ling'ring seems to stay,</L>
<L>Full fond his fav'rite <HI>Twick'nam</HI> to embrace:</L>
<L>Beneath the Shade, embower'd as I lay,</L>
<L>The awful Gloom inspir'd the solemn Song,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>DISTRESS the Theme, and RADNOR deigns to hear;</L>
<L>RADNOR, whose Friendship even honour'd POPE,</L>
<L>(Tho' now vouchsaf'd to a more humble Muse,)</L>
<L>While here retir'd in philosophic Ease,</L>
<L>He smiles—at the vain Bustle of a Court.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AID me, <HI>Melpomene!</HI> thou pensive Maid,</L>
<L>But not of plunder'd Provinces to sing,</L>
<L>Nor the dread Horrors of th' imbattled Plain,</L>
<L>When fierce <HI>Bellona</HI> pours her Thunders round,</L>
<L>And all is Ruin—Desolation all—</L>
<L>Nor the tremendous Horrors of Distress,</L>
<L>That roar in Tempest, and Confusion dire,</L>
<L>Extending wide o'er all the troubled Deep;</L>
<L>Nor that Distress so late conspicuous seen,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>In the pale Face of those who greatly fear'd</L>
<L>The Earth's Concussion, nor would trust their God;</L>
<L>But vainly thought the Purpose of his Will</L>
<L><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the late Earthquake, when many Families retired from the City.</NOTE> To evade by Flight—</L>
<L>Ah! how in vain, Omnipotence to fly?</L>
<L>'Tis Woe domestic that compells the Muse</L>
<L>To paint the Ravage, and Havock cruel,</L>
<L>Private Distress makes on the Sons of Men;</L>
<L>That fell Distress which robb'd me of my Friend,</L>
<L>The gay, the good, benevolent ALPHONSO:</L>
<L>For oh! to fall from the Height of Affluence,</L>
<L>To the Abyss of Want—Stupendious Shock!</L>
<L>Dread Separation!—as when the Soul,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Struggling to quit the cumb'rous Load of Flesh,</L>
<L>Would wing its Passage to the Realms of Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE well-fill'd Table now no more attracts</L>
<L>The jocund Eye, nor smiling Plenty now</L>
<L>O'er the rich Feast presides, but meagre Want,</L>
<L>With Harpy Talon drives her from the Board.</L>
<L>Nor does the joyous Bowl now sparkling glow,</L>
<L>Flush'd with rich Juice of Grape nectareous.</L>
<L>But pale, depriv'd of all the rosy Hue,</L>
<L>Its Loss bemoans in Tears of limpid Streams.</L>
<L>Add too, the Rigour of the Wintry Cold,</L>
<L>But poorly parry'd by the threadbare Coat;</L>
<L>Severer still—the lately decent Dress</L>
<L>Puts it's sad Master often to the Blush,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Now gay Amusements—and the well trod Stage,</L>
<L>Are all absorb'd in Scenes of real Grief;</L>
<L>Nor Song—nor Dance—nor Music's soothing Voice,</L>
<L>Is heard—alas! They fly the shatter'd Roof,</L>
<L>Here moaping Melancholy dwells—her Head</L>
<L>Reclin'd upon her shrivell'd Hand—but ill</L>
<L>Supported by her trem'lous Knee — her Eye,</L>
<L><HI>Fixt motionless</HI> — She pensive sits forlorn,</L>
<L>Biting her Nails, and broods o'er Fears immense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE, these are Ills indeed! — yet tolerable,</L>
<L>For rich Content will make the Balance ev'n.</L>
<L>But then to lose the Quintessence of Life,</L>
<L>Shut out from Commerce of the Social Kind,</L>
<L>Where sprightly Wit, and Elegance of Manners,</L>
<L>Raise high the Fancy, and refine the Soul;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>(For sure he's more than Man, or somewhat less,</L>
<L>Who takes no Pleasure in Society)</L>
<L>Or driv'n to Solitude, or forc'd to bear</L>
<L>The noisy Jargon of Plebeian Tongues,</L>
<L>Converse indelicate! avert it Heav'n!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AH! who can tell the agonizing Pain,</L>
<L>Which like an Arrow pierceth to the Heart,</L>
<L>Oft as by Chance we meet a quondam Friend,</L>
<L>Conscious of Poverty, the down-cast Eye</L>
<L>Would fain the Meeting shun; — but not so oft</L>
<L>As insolent Contempt avoids our Path,</L>
<L>Scowling with Eye askance — ah! dire Reverse,</L>
<L>It was not thus, — when happier Fortunes smil'd,</L>
<L>And circling Friends re-eccho'd our Applause.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>When the glad Welcome hail'd th' obsequious Guest,</L>
<L>And the full Goblet crown'd the genial Day:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! 'tis a Task requires his utmost Art,</L>
<L>To stem the Torrent of Adversity,</L>
<L>To work the Vessel thro' a Sea of Woes,</L>
<L>And bravely head her against proud Disdain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS must be done— nay more — he must submit</L>
<L>His every Action to be canvass'd o'er,</L>
<L>The Ridicule of every low Buffoon:</L>
<L>What tho' his Eloquence should far exceed</L>
<L>The <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Stile, — and solid Judgment,</L>
<L>Persuasion clear on ev'ry Accent hang,</L>
<L>Yet he's not heard, but pass'd unheeded by,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>And every Fool can comment on his Words:</L>
<L>What boots it him? that kindly Nature gave,</L>
<L>What Science has improv'd, a Soul full-fraught</L>
<L>With noblest Purposes, and grand Designs;</L>
<L>Yet is he still depress'd — his Views confin'd,</L>
<L>Each rising Act by Disappointment cramp'd;</L>
<L>While keen Reflection preys upon the Sense,</L>
<L>Yet laudable Ambition prompts him on;</L>
<L>But ah! in vain his tow'ring Thoughts repuls'd,</L>
<L>A thousand Schemes distract his tortur'd Brain,</L>
<L>A thousand Passions agitate the Soul,</L>
<L>And all the Man is one intestine War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEE! black Despondence, with her gloomy Train</L>
<L>Of grisly Horrors hovers o'er the Soul,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Distraction, Frenzy seizing the sick Heart,</L>
<L>Consign her over to the Fiend Despair,</L>
<L>Which often ends in Dereliction dire,</L>
<L>And sad Distrust of Providential Care;</L>
<L>Prompting to Suicide — inevitable!</L>
<L>Had not thy Goodness — oh, all-wise Creator!</L>
<L>Hedg'd in our Being, and so fenc'd it round,</L>
<L>With Love of Life, Self-Preservation strong,</L>
<L>We dare not leap the Boundaries prescrib'd;</L>
<L>Else would weak Man, oppress'd by Woes, rush out</L>
<L>Of Life more oft; for who can tell the Pangs</L>
<L>Of modest Merit struggling with Distress,</L>
<L>Whose Education lib'ral, whose gen'rous Mind,</L>
<L>Can't brook Servility, nor stoop to ask</L>
<L>Mean Pittance from the Hand of Charity;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>Not so the Beggar, who without a Blush,</L>
<L>With clam'rous Bawl can roar his Wants aloud,</L>
<L>Which not reliev'd he tauntingly returns,</L>
<L>In mutt'ring Curses on th' unbounteous Hand;</L>
<L>These, happy in the Dregs and Scum of Life,</L>
<L>But little know what real Anguish means.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE lordly Worldlings, who now rowl at Ease</L>
<L>To City Feast, or Midnight Masquerade,</L>
<L>How dare ye let the Worthy be depress'd,</L>
<L>And thus confess the Impudence of Wealth?</L>
<L>Cannot ye read this Picture of Distress?</L>
<L>Must it be heighthen'd? Must the Look confus'd,</L>
<L>And the Grief-shiv'ring Eye still speak in vain?</L>
<L>Not so the great Benevolent— who improve</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>Each Hint, each Intimation, that their Breast,</L>
<L>Or social Talk suggests — both to prevent.</L>
<L>And to assist Distress — whose Eye extends</L>
<L>Even beyond the Circle of Acquaintance,</L>
<L>Glad to find Merit in its lone Retreat,</L>
<L>To deal Benevolence diffusive round,</L>
<L>Unbounded — Imitators of their God!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! 'tis great to grapple with Adversity,</L>
<L>To wrest the Sceptre from her Iron Hand,</L>
<L>And dash in Pieces her imbitter'd Cup —</L>
<L>Hydra-headed Monster! thrice arduous Task!</L>
<L>More than <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour it requires</L>
<L>To cope with such a Foe; — how few enjoy</L>
<L>Fit Prowess to engage in equal Fight?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>But he whose stubborn Virtue baffles her,</L>
<L>Without the Aid of mean, or fervile Arts,</L>
<L>Nor has Recourse to Violence, or Fraud,</L>
<L>And scorns to seek Relief fallacious,</L>
<L>From the intoxicating purple Draught,</L>
<L>A far more glorious Victory has gain'd,</L>
<L>Than <HI>Philip</HI>'s Son or <HI>Caesar</HI> e'er could boast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT 'gainst this Foe what Arms shall we take up?</L>
<L>Shall we in close Attrenchment wait th' Assault?</L>
<L>Or greatly dare her to the open Field?</L>
<L>Shall we with <HI>Horace</HI> ridicule her Pow'r,</L>
<L>Deride her Force, and laugh her into Shame?</L>
<L>Well might he laugh, when great <HI>Augustus</HI> smil'd,</L>
<L>And the World's Master own'd him for his Friend:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>Warm in the Beams of the <HI>Augustan</HI> Court,</L>
<L>The icy Phangs of Poverty ne'r reach'd him;</L>
<L>It was <HI>Maecenas</HI> generous and benign,</L>
<L>That animated all, and gave new Life,</L>
<L>Else had his Wit in languid Numbers flow'd,</L>
<L>And his unmeaning Satyr known no Sting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHALL we with <HI>Seneca,</HI> in formal, grave,</L>
<L>Collected Maxims of the pedant Schools,</L>
<L>Summon our boasted Reason to our Aid,</L>
<L>And open War declare? but let us scorn</L>
<L>To take the least Advantage of the Foe —</L>
<L>No; when she presseth sore, with heaviest Woes,</L>
<L>Let us engage her then on equal Terms,</L>
<L>Not when we are immers'd in Wealth immense,</L>
<L>Sufficient Price for mighty Provinces.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<L>AWAY, ye Bablers of the Stoic Race,</L>
<L>Wise, solemn Fools! Nature is Nature still,</L>
<L>Whate'er your vaunted Apathy and Pride,</L>
<L>Rank Pride and Vanity of Heart would boast,</L>
<L>Oft prov'd too weak — recoils upon itself,</L>
<L>And gives our Nature the opprobrious Lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GREAT <HI>Julius</HI> tasted of desponding Fear,</L>
<L>And wav'ring doubted ev'n to trust his Gods;</L>
<L><HI>Brutus,</HI> in whom the Elements so nice</L>
<L>Were mix'd — that to be great and good were one,</L>
<L>Could not survive <HI>Philippi</HI>'s fatal Shock;</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Cato</HI>'s rigid Virtue bow'd — a Proof</L>
<L>That mere Philosophy's no equal Match.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>Pardon, great Shades! your Virtues I revere,</L>
<L>But ye were Men, and Men cannot but feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! let not those, whose Cup's but lightly dash'd—</L>
<L>Who never yet drank deep of dire Distress,</L>
<L>Define the Bitter of the nauseous Draught —</L>
<L>Let not the Hale and Sound, who never felt</L>
<L>Disease — mock at the Sick — too happy far</L>
<L>To judge aright, and draw Conclusions just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NECESSITY, like Death, which levels all,</L>
<L>Would share the Empire with our mortal Foe,</L>
<L>Adding new Conquests to his grim Colleague,</L>
<L>Still daily glutting his voracious Maw,</L>
<L>Too oft the Greatest and the Best his Prey:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>Sad Truths! enough to terrify the Soul,</L>
<L>And make her curse the Privilege of Thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more — adieu — ye solitary Shades,</L>
<L>Engend'ring Phantoms buzzing all around,</L>
<L>Thick as a Cloud of Gnats on Summer Eve;</L>
<L>Let sprightlier Scenes divert the gloomy Thought,</L>
<L>And brighten Fancy with the gay Delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAIL! RADNOR'S ever-pleasing still Retreat,</L>
<L>Where Art and Nature mutually combine</L>
<L>To banish Grief, and anxious Care beguile,</L>
<L>Filling the Mind with pleasing Reveries;</L>
<L>Neatness and Beauty, what fam'd <HI>Horace</HI> sang,</L>
<L><HI>Simplex Munditiis,</HI> the finish'd Whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
<L>WHILST Poetry's gay Sister here enrob'd,</L>
<L>With various Colours of the rosy Morn,</L>
<L>In Draughts diversify'd, suspends the Mind,</L>
<L>Sweetly perplex'd in Approbation — See!</L>
<L>Th' embattled Heroes live along the Wall,</L>
<L>Wake the Attention, and provoke the Soul</L>
<L>To Deeds of hardy Valour, worthy Fame;</L>
<L>There the droll Piece in grotesque Figure plays</L>
<L>Upon the Sense, excites the smerking Laugh,</L>
<L>While dull-eye'd Melancholy steals away:</L>
<L>Here the cool Grott, and there the cooler Stream,</L>
<L>Whose gentle Current flows, clear, deep, serene,</L>
<L>Emblem of RADNOR'S philosophic Mind —</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<L>ENOUGH, my Muse, nor too advent'rous soar —</L>
<L>RADNOR! 'tis thine to please, or to instruct,</L>
<L>To form the Manners, or to mend the Heart.</L>
