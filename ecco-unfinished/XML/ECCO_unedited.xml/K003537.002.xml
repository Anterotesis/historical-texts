<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of
the GENTLEMAN-CITIZEN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the Prior had made an end of
reading the Story, he cast his Eyes
on <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and found his shut,
and that he did not stir; and there∣upon
approaching to him, and crying
out aloud, “My Friend, are you in
this World, or the other?” he look'd stedfastly
upon him, and told him afterwards, that he was
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
so charm'd with the White Cat, that he thought
he was at the Wedding, or picking up some of the
Emerald or Diamond Buckles. “Then you love
these sort of Fictions?” <HI>reply'd the Prior.</HI> “They
are no Fictions, <HI>added</HI> Dandinardiere; all this once
happen'd, and may do again, tho they are now
indeed out of fashion: Oh! had I lived in
those days, I should have made myself a con∣siderable
Fortune.” “You had, without dispute,
<HI>continued the Prior,</HI> marry'd a Fairy.” “I know not
that, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, they seem to me too
ugly, and if I marry, I must please my Fancy.”
“That is to say, <HI>interrupted the Prior,</HI> you would have
a Lady of Worth, beautiful, virtuous, and witty,
but would not stand for Fortune, being persuaded
that it is hard to meet with all at once: Well, I
love you the better for this, I shall speak in your
praise for the future.” “You don't take me right,
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, I would have the Person I
marry endow'd with all the Qualifications of Bo∣dy
and Mind, and rich besides; and at that time
when there were Fairies, I should have found out
the way to have got a Queen, nothing could be
more easy, since it might be done by three
words of <HI>Brelu, Breloc,</HI> by a Wand, or any thing;
whereas now if a Man be poor, and would be
rich, he must work like an Horse, and perhaps
to no purpose:”
<Q>O Tempora! O Mores!</Q>
“Mr. Prior, <HI>continued he,</HI> what say you, this Latin
is not amiss. “Oh! <HI>answer'd the Prior,</HI> I admire
you as much, as you do the White Cat; your
Conversation is so good, one is always instructed
by it.” This little Mortal was so overjoy'd at this
Commendation, that he resolved, in order to gain
immortal Honour, to make a Story in his turn;
and to that end desired of the Prior that <HI>Alain</HI>
might be acquainted with the Accident that had
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
befel him, that he might come to him. Afterwards
thanking him for the favour he had done him, in
reading so long by him, he pretended to be sleepy,
that he might have the more liberty to muse and
think. And indeed he thought, but it was more of
<HI>Virginia</HI> than the Fairies: “What a Sublimity of
Wit has she, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> for one that has been
brought up and educated by the Sea-side, who
ought to have no more Genius than a Sole or an
Oyster-shell, to write as well as the most cele∣brated
Authors? I have good Judgment, and
when I approve any thing, it must be excellent:
I like the White Cat, which is excellent, and I
will maintain it against all Mankind. My Valet
<HI>Alain,</HI> whom I have armed cap-a-pee, shall enter
the Lists, and fight for me.” After this manner
he went on, and made as much noise as twenty
People. As soon as Mr. <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was acquainted
with it, suspicious lest his Fall should have turn'd
his Brain, he came to hear his Extravagances,
which gave him no small cause of Amazement.
When <HI>Alain</HI> came, he would not suffer him to go
into his Master's Chamber, for fear of his making
him talk the more, and disturbing him, but bid
him come again the next day. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was so
desirous of making a Story, that he could not sleep
all night, and was heartily grieved for want of his
Secretary to write it down; but before day he a∣waken'd
the whole House to send a Messenger for
<HI>Alain,</HI> which made the Baron, seeing him so impa∣tient,
dispatch one presently for that faithful Do∣mestick.
As soon as ever he saw him, he bounced
up an end in bed, and holding out his Arms, cry'd,
“Come, <HI>Alain,</HI> come my Friend, I have the most
surprizing things in the World to tell you.” “Give
me leave, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Alain, <HI>whose Heart relented to see
his Master's Head so bound up,</HI> to ask you how you
do, for that is the greatest Concern to me.” “I
should be better, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere; but alas!
my greatest Illness lies not in my Head: I am in
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
love, <HI>Alain; Cupid</HI> never let fly a surer Dart.” To
this <HI>Alain</HI> made no Reply; for he knew as little of
<HI>Cupid</HI> as of the Alcoran, and was afraid he might
be guilty of some Blunder. “What have you not
one word to say?” <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere. “No, Sir,
<HI>answer'd</HI> Alain, I am at present all Ears.” “Then
hear what has happen'd to me, <HI>said he;</HI> I have en∣gaged
my Liberty to a young Princess.” “For
how much?” <HI>interrupted</HI> Alain. “Do you think,
Blockhead, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, it was for a Ha∣bit,
or some Jewels?” “I know not what to think,
<HI>answer'd the Valet,</HI> you speak to me of things I am
an entire Stranger to; for example, where could
you find a Princess in this Country, unless one
that had been shipwreck'd, and cast on the shore?”
“Indeed you argue very well, <HI>reply'd the Master,</HI>
there are not many Princesses hereabouts; but
she whom I adore deserves to be one, and in my
eyes is the same as if she was one. She is call'd
<HI>Virginia,</HI> which is an old <HI>Roman</HI> Name, for the
Love of which alone she shall possess my Heart.”
<HI>Alain</HI> open'd his Eyes and Mouth, and stared like a
stuck Pig, amazed at his Master's Learning; but all
the time kept a respectful Silence, which gave him
time to proceed: but reflecting at last, that this
did not further on the Story he was resolved to
write, he order'd <HI>Alain</HI> to go home that minute,
and put all his Books in a Cart or two, and bring
them to him. “What, Sir, <HI>said he, somewhat melancholy,</HI>
do you design to live here?” “No, my Friend, <HI>re∣plied
our sick Man,</HI> I shall only stay till my Wounds
are well; but I have a great Work to go thro
with, and shall be obliged to look into some of
the best Authors: run presently, and return with
speed.” But as <HI>Alain</HI> was going in all haste, he
met the Baron, Viscount, and Prior, who were
forced to call to him several times, before they
could get him to come back. “Tell me, <HI>Alain, said
the Baron,</HI> where your Master has sent you, for
that Air of Business I read in your Countenance,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
makes me somewhat curious.” “I am going, Sir,
<HI>answer'd</HI> Alain, for all his Books, and his Learn∣ing;
he is going to write one of the finest things
in the World, and will, I believe, stand in need
of your Assistance.” “I am persuaded of that, <HI>replied
the Baron;</HI> but stay here, he has Books enough
already to employ himself agreeably.” “Oh! I
dare not disobey him for all the World, he must
have four times as many as any other Person, and
when he is angry, he beats me; I am sure I ex∣perienced
it enough, since he has had this Quar∣rel
upon his hands.” “I give you my word, <HI>said
the Viscount, stopping him,</HI> you shall not stir till you
tell us what he beat you for.” This was too good
an opportunity for <HI>Alain,</HI> who loved prattling, to
neglect it; he told them how he dress'd him up in
Armour, that he might pass for himself, and all
he said to encourage him to fight like a Hero.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen look'd at one another, amazed
at the Extravagancies of the Master, and the Sim∣plicity
of the Man, and would have hinder'd him,
but in vain, from going to his Master's Study; but
he told them he must go, tho it was to throw all
the Books into the Sea: and go he would. “Well,
<HI>said the Baron</HI> de St. Thomas <HI>to his two Friends,</HI> do
you advise me seriously to think of <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
for one of my Daughters? By their Whims and
Notions, they seem as if they were made for one
another; yet a Family must be but poorly mana∣ged
by such Heads.” “Don't be out of conceit
with him, <HI>answer'd the Viscount,</HI> he is rich, tho a
little <HI>Quixotish,</HI> but he wants Courage, for you
see at the very Name of <HI>Villeville</HI> he trembles;
these Extravagancies will soon leave him: for 'tis
hard for one, that is always afraid, to keep up
these bravadoing Airs.” “Add to this, <HI>said the
Prior,</HI> that you may engage him to live with you,
and that you may redress all their Faults.” “I
am more afraid, <HI>said the Baron, smiling,</HI> they will
sooner crack my Brains, than any Remonstrances
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
of mine will have any effect on theirs. There's
my Wife, and her two Daughters, have each a
singular Genius, and to add <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> to them,
will render the Extravagance yet greater.” “No
matter for that, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> there's a good Foun∣dation
of ready Money; I will never forgive you,
if you let him escape: but now I think on it,
I will go and see him, and know what he intends
to write.”</P>
<P>Away he went directly to his Chamber, and af∣ter
having ask'd him what News, told him, that as
he was his Reader the day before, he was now
come to offer his Service to be his Secretary. “You
cannot, Sir, do me a greater pleasure, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan∣dinardiere,
<HI>holding out his Arms;</HI> for tho I have
<HI>Alain,</HI> yet his Writing is so horrible, that we
should want a third Person to decypher his
Scrawl: besides, he has so little Wit, that all the
fine and good things I say, are lost, because he
does not understand them.” “Well, <HI>said the Prior,</HI>
I shall be proud to be your Secretary, at least
while you are indisposed.” “O! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dan∣dinardiere,
I am your humble Servant and Slave
for ever.” “It is enough for me, <HI>said the Prior,</HI>
that you are my Friend; but let me know your
Design, whether you will treat on your Subject
in Prose or Verse.” “It is equal to me which, <HI>re∣ply'd
our Citizen,</HI> provided I make but a Story, to
convince <HI>Virginia</HI> that I fall not short of her in
Wit; but what vexes me most, is, I never saw
any Fairies, and know not where they live.” “Do
not puzzle yourself about that, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> I can
assist you; and that you may not rack your
Brains, here's one in my Pocket I have just fi∣nish'd,
which has never yet been seen by any
one.” “O! Sir, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, if you will
sell it me, and swear never to brag of it, I will
give you, with all my heart, four Pieces for it.”
“That's too little, <HI>reply'd the Prior,</HI> it had better cost
you nothing.” At the same time he shew'd a great
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Bundle of Paper, which <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was so charm∣ed
with, that he was for getting out of bed to
throw himself at his feet; but what pleased him
most, was, it cost him nothing. Now this Story
the Prior had stole out of the young Madam <HI>de St.
Thomas's</HI> Chamber, which they did not so soon per∣ceive,
because as they writ very much, several of
their Papers lay loose about: but this he did not
think fit to let <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> know, that he might
not lose the Merit of his Generosity, and fancy'd
it would be pleasant to hear the Dispute that would
arise between the true Author and the Plagiary;
and seeing him impatient to hear it, began as
follows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of Fortunio, the Fortunate
Knight.</HEAD>
<P>THERE once reign'd a powerful King, who
was a Prince of great Clemency, and very
well beloved by his Subjects: but being engaged
in a War with an Emperor, whose Name was <HI>Ma∣tapa,</HI>
a neighbouring and potent Prince; after seve∣ral
Battels, the Emperor at last gain'd an entire
and signal Victory. The King had most of his Of∣ficers
and Soldiers kill'd, or taken Prisoners, and
the Emperor soon after besieged his Capital Town,
and took it; by which means he became Master of
all the Treasures. The King had much ado to
escape himself, with the Queen-Dowager his Sister,
who was young, beautiful, and witty, but withal
proud, hasty, and difficult of Access. The Empe∣ror
transported all the Jewels and rich Furniture
to his own Palace, and took a great number of
young Damsels, Horses, and whatever might be
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
useful and agreeable to him; and when he had de∣populated
the greatest part of the Kingdom, re∣turned
in Triumph home, where he was received
by the Empress, and the Princess his Daughter,
with all the Joy imaginable; while the dethroned
King endured, with the utmost impatience, his
Misfortunes. He assembled what Troops he had
left, form'd a small Army, and to augment it as
soon as possible, published an Ordonnance, requiring
all Gentlemen, who were his Subjects, either to
come and serve him in thier own proper Persons,
or to send one of their Sons well mounted and
armed.</P>
<P>There lived on the Frontiers an old Lord, who
had seen full fourscore Years, and was a Man of
extraordinary Parts; but had partaken so much of
the Frowns of Fortune, that he was very much re∣duced,
and had bore all his Ill-fortune with
more patience, had not three beautiful Daughters
shared it with him. But as they were Women of
good Sense, they never murmur'd at their Misfor∣tunes,
but rather, when they spoke, comforted
their Father, than added to his Afflictions. In this
manner they lived with him in an old Country-House,
free from Ambition, when this Ordonnance
reach'd the old Gentleman's Ears; who call'd his
Daughters, and with a Countenance that discover'd
the Grief of his Mind, said to them, “What shall
we do? The King has order'd all Persons of Di∣stinction
in his Dominions to serve him against the
Emperor, or pay such a Fine, which I am not
able to do; and these Extremities will either cost
me my Life, or be our Ruin.” His three Daugh∣ters
were as much concern'd as himself at this
News, but yet desired him not to be dishearten'd,
since they were persuaded some Remedy might be
found out. The next day, the eldest went to her
Father, as he was walking melancholily in his lit∣tle
Orchard, and said to him, “I come, my Lord,
to intreat you to let me go to the Army; I am of
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
an advantageous height enough, and robust; I
will dress myself in Mens Clothes, and pass for
your Son: if I do not heroick Actions, I shall
however save you a Journey, or the Tax, which
is a great deal in our Circumstances.” The
Count embraced her tenderly, and at first opposed
so extraordinary a Design; but she represented to
him, with great Firmness of Mind, that there was
no other Expedient, and thereby got his consent.
Her Father provided Clothes and Arms for her,
and gave her the best of four Horses, which he
kept to go to Plow and Cart; and after the most
tender Farewell on both sides, she set out on her
Journey. After some days travel, as she pass'd by
a large Meadow, beset with a quick-set Hedge, she
saw a Shepherdess very much grieved, who was en∣deavouring
to pull a Sheep out of a Ditch: “What
are you doing there, Shepherdess?” <HI>said she.</HI> “A∣las!
<HI>reply'd the Shepherdess,</HI> I am striving to save a
Sheep that is almost drowned, and am so weak,
that I cannot draw him out.” “I pity you,” <HI>said
she;</HI> and, without offering her assistance, rid away.
Whereupon the Shepherdess cry'd out, “Good-by,
disguised Fair.” Which put our Heroine into an
inexpressible Surprize. “How is it possible, <HI>said
she to herself,</HI> that I should be known? This old
Shepherdess has but just set her Eyes on me, and
has discover'd what I am; what shall I do? I
shall be known to all the world, and how asham'd
and vex'd shall I be, if the King should find me
out? He will think my Father a Coward, that
durst not expose himself to Danger.” At last she
concluded to go home again.</P>
<P>The Count and his Daughters were talking of
her, and reckoning how long she had been gone,
when they saw her come in, who told them her
Adventure The good old Count said it was no∣thing
but what he foresaw; that if she would have
taken his Advice, she had not gone, because he
thought it impossible but she must be discovered.
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
This little Family was embarass'd again, when the
second Daughter said to her Father, “I am not
surprized that my Sister should be discover'd,
since she never was on horseback before; but for
my part, if you will let me go in her stead, I
dare promise, you shall not need to repent it.”
It was in vain for the old Count to refuse her; he
was forced to consent, and she took other Clothes
and Arms and another Horse; and when she was
thus equip'd, embraced her Father and Sisters, and
resolved to serve the King: but as she pass'd by
the same Meadow, she saw the same Shepherdess
drawing a Sheep out of a deep Ditch, who cry'd
out, “Unfortunate Wretch that I am, to lose half
my Flock after this manner; if any body would
help me, I might save this poor Creature.” “What,
Shepherdess, <HI>cry'd out this second Daughter,</HI> do you
take no better care of your Sheep, than to let
them fall into the Water?” Then spur'd on her
Horse, and rid away. “Farewell, disguised Fair,
<HI>cry'd the old Woman to her.</HI>” Which Words were
no small Affliction to our <HI>Amazon.</HI> “How unfor∣tunate,
<HI>said she,</HI> is it to be thus known; I have
no better luck than my Sister: it will be ridicu∣lous
for me to go to the Army with such an effe∣minate
Air.” Thereupon she return'd home very
much vex'd at her bad Success.</P>
<P>The old Count receiv'd her with a great deal of
Tenderness, and commended her Prudence, but
could not help being chagrin'd at the expence he
had been at of two Suits of Clothes and other
things, tho' he conceal'd it as much as possible from
his Daughters. At last the youngest Daughter de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed
him, with the most pressing instances, to give
her leave, as he had done both her Sisters. “Per∣haps,
<HI>said she,</HI> you may think it presumption in
me to think to succeed better than they, yet
I desire I may try; I am somewhat taller than
they: you know I have been used to hunting,
which Exercise bears some Parallel with War;
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
and my great Desire to comfort you in your Mis∣fortunes,
will inspire me with an extraordinary
Courage.” As the Count loved this Daughter
better than the other two, because she always took
most care of him, read to divert him, and kill'd
Game for him; he used all the Arguments he was
master of, to dissuade her from her design. “If you
leave me, my dear Child, <HI>said he,</HI> your Absence
will be my Death; for should Fortune favour you
in your Undertaking, and you should return
crown'd with Laurels, I shall not have the plea∣sure
of seeing it, since I am in so advanced an
Age.” “No, Father, <HI>said she,</HI> don't think the time
long, the War must soon be at an end; and if I
find out any other way to fulfil the King's Or∣ders,
I won't neglect it: for I can assure you, if
my absence is a trouble to you, it is no less to
me.” By these words she at last persuaded him
into a Consent, and after that made up a plain Suit
of Clothes, for her Sisters had exhausted the old
Count's Treasures too much for her to have any
better; and was forc'd to take up with one of the
worst Horses, because the others were lamed; but
all this could not discourage her: She embraced
her Father, ask'd his Blessing, and after shedding
some Tears with him and her Sisters, set forwards
on her Journey.</P>
<P>As she went by the same Meadow, she saw the
old Shepherdess endeavouring to pull the Sheep
out of the Ditch. “What are you doing there,
Shepherdess?” <HI>said she.</HI> “I have been doing, Sir,
<HI>reply'd the old Woman,</HI> till I can do no longer; I
have been ever since break of d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y striving to get
this Sheep out, and all to no purpose; and I am
so weary I can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>: there's never a day
passes over my he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but some Misfortune attends
me, and nobody will help me.” “Indeed I pity
you, <HI>said our you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Warrior;</HI> and to shew it the
more, will assist you.” Thereupon alighting from
her Horse, and jumping over the Hedge, she went into
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
the Ditch, where she work'd till she got this fa∣vourite
Sheep out. “Don't cry, Shepherdess, <HI>said
she,</HI> here's your Sheep; and considering the time
he has lain in the Water, he is very brisk.” “You
shall not find me ungrateful, charming Maid, <HI>said
the Shepherdess;</HI> I know where you are going and
all your Designs: your Sisters pass'd by this Mea∣dow,
I knew them and their Thoughts; but they
were so hard-hearted and unkind, that I found
the means to prevent their Journey; but for your
part you shall find it otherwise. I am a Fairy,
and have a great Inclination to reward those that
are deserving. That Horse you ride is but a poor
sorry one, I will give you a better.” Thereupon
striking the ground with her Crook, our Warrior
heard a whinnying behind a Holt of Trees, and
presently saw a beautiful Horse galloping about the
Meadow. The Fairy call'd this Courser to her,
and touching him with her Crook, said, Faithful
<HI>Comrade,</HI> be accoutred finer than the best Horse
of the Emperor <HI>Matapa;</HI> and immediately <HI>Com∣rade</HI>
had on a Saddle and Housing of green Velvet,
embroider'd with Diamonds, a Bridle strung with
Pearls, with the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses and Bit of Gold.</P>
<P>“What you see, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> is the least thing
you ought to admire this Horse for; he has a
great many rare Qualities which I will inform
you of. First, he eats but once in eight days;
and then he knows what's past, present, and to
come: for I have had him a long time, and
brought him up to my hand. When you want to
be inform'd of any thing, or are at a loss for
Advice, you must address yourself to him, and
must look on him more like your Friend than
Horse. Besides, I don't like your Habit, I'll give
you one shall please you better.” Then striking
on the ground with her Crook, there arose up a
turkey-leather Trunk adorn'd with Nails of Gold;
the Fairy look'd in the Grass for the Key which
open'd it: it was lined with Spanish-leather em∣broider'd,
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
and contain'd a dozen compleat Suits of
Clothes, with dozens of all Appurtenances, as
Swords, Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Clothes were so rich
with Imbroidery and Diamonds, that our <HI>Amazon</HI>
could hardly lift them. The Fairy bid her chuse
which she liked best, and told her the rest should
follow her wherever she went, and that she needed
but to stamp with her Foot, and call for the Tur∣key-leather
Trunk, and it should come to her full
of Money and Jewels, or full of fine Linen and
Laces, which she call'd for, either into her Cham∣ber,
or in the Field. “But, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> you must
make choice of some Name agreeable to your
Profession; and I think you may call yourself
<HI>Fortunio:</HI> besides, I think it not improper you
should know me in my own Person.” At that
very moment she cast off her old Skin, and appear'd
so beautiful that she dazzled the Eyes of our young
Heroine. Her Habit was blue Velvet lin'd with
Ermine, her Hair was platted with Pearls, and
on her Head stood a stately Crown. Our young
Warrior was so transported with admiration, she
cast herself at her feet, so great was her Acknow∣ledgment.
The Fairy raised her up, and embraced
her tenderly, and bid her take an Habit of gold
and green Brocade, which she accordingly obey'd,
and mounting her Horse, continued on her Jour∣ney,
so penetrated with the extraordinary Fortune
she had met with, that she could think on nothing
else. She examined with herself by what Good∣fortune
she had gain'd the Good-will of so power∣ful
a Fairy; for said she to herself, “She could
with one stroke of her Wand have drawn out,
without my assistance, a whole Flock from the
Center of the Earth. It was fortunate for me I
was so ready to oblige her; she knew the Senti∣ments
of my Heart, and approved of them. If
my Father saw me now so rich, and in all this
Magnificence, how overjoy'd would he be, and
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
how well pleased should I be to have my Family
Partakers with me!”</P>
<P>As she made an end of these Reflections, she ar∣rived
at a great City, and drew on her the Eyes
of all the People, who follow'd and crouded about
her, saying, they never saw so fine and handsome
a Knight, and so graceful an Horse before. She
had all manner of Respect paid to her, which she
return'd with all imaginable Civility. As soon as
she came to an Inn, the Governour, who had seen
her as he was walking out, and admir'd her, sent
a Gentleman to desire her to accept of an Apart∣ment
in his Castle. <HI>Fortunio,</HI> for so we must
call her, answer'd, that as he had not the honour
to be known to him▪ he wou'd not take that free∣dom,
but would come and pay his Respects to
him; but withal desired he would let him have a
trusty Servant to send to his Father: which the
Governour did instantly, and our Knight desired
him to come again at night, because his Dispatches
were not ready. He shut himself up fast in his
Chamber, then stamping with his foot, and calling
for the Turkey-leather Trunk full of Diamonds and
Pistoles, it appear'd that moment; but then he was
at a loss for the Key, and knew not where to find
it, and thought with himself it would be a thou∣sand
pities to break open a Trunk so curiously
wrought, and to have so much Riches exposed to
the Indiscretion or Knavery of a Lock-smith, that
might talk publickly of them, and by that means
inform all Robbers of it. “What use are these Fa∣vours
of, <HI>the Fairy cry'd,</HI> since I can neither enjoy
them myself, nor let my Father receive any bene∣fit
from them?” Then musing and walking about,
he remembred he should consult his Horse; away
he goes to the Stable, and whisper'd softly to him,
“Pray <HI>Comrade</HI> tell me where I shall find the Key
of the Turkey-leather Trunk.” “In my Ear,” <HI>an∣swered
he.</HI> The Knight look'd in his Ear, and saw
a green Ribbon, by which he pulled out the Key,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
He open'd the Trunk, and fill'd three little Chests
full of Diamonds and Pistols, one for his Father,
and two for his Sisters, and sent the Governour's
Man with them, desiring him not to stop night nor
day, till he arriv'd at the old Count's. When the
Messenger told him he came from his Son the
Knight, and brought him a very heavy Chest, he
was very much surprized at what it could contain,
for he knew he had so little Money when he set
out, that he could not buy any thing, nor pay the
Person for bringing his Present. First he open'd
his Letter, and when he saw what his dear Daugh∣ter
had sent him, he was ready to die for Joy; the
sight of the Jewels and Gold made good her words:
but what was most extraordinary, when the two
Sisters came to open their Chests, there were
nought but cut Glass and false Pistoles; so unwil∣ling
was the Fairy that they should receive any
Favours from her: insomuch, that they thought
their Sister mock'd them, and thereupon conceiv'd
an inexpressible Hatred against her. The Count
seeing them so angry, gave them a great many of
the Jewels; but as soon as ever they touch'd them,
they changed like the rest, by which they knew
some unknown Power acted against them, and
begg'd of their Father to keep them to himself.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> never stay'd for the Return of the Messen∣ger,
so short was the time limited to obey the
King's Edict in; but went and took his leave of
the Governour. The whole City was assembled
together to see him: his Person and all his Actions
had somewhat so engaging in them, that they could
not but love and admire him. He never spoke, but
they express'd a pleasure at every word; and the
Croud was so great, that he who had been used
all his Life-time to the Country, knew not what
it was owing to. After all Civilities paid and re∣ceiv'd,
he set forward on his Journey, and was
entertain'd most agreeably by his Horse, who told
him of a great many remarkable things both in old
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
and modern Histories, till they arrived at a vast
Forest; when <HI>Comrade</HI> said to the Knight, “Master,
there lives here a Man who may be of great use
to us: he is a Wood-Man, and one who is gift∣ed.”
“What do you mean by that, <HI>interrupted the
Knight.</HI>” “One, <HI>said the Horse,</HI> who is endow'd by
Fairies with some rare Qualities; therefore we
must engage him to come along with us.” At
that instant they came to the Place where the
Wood-Man was at work. The young Knight ap∣proach'd
him with a sweet and pleasant Air, and
ask'd him several Questions about the place where
they were; whether there were any wild Beasts
in the Forest, and if People were allowed to hunt
them; to which the Wood-Man return'd him very
suitable Answers. Then he ask'd him who help'd
him to fell so many Trees; he answer'd, he had
fell'd them all himself, and that it was the work
only of some few hours, and that he must fell a
few more to make a little Burden. “What, <HI>said
the Knight,</HI> do you pretend to carry all this Wood
to-day.” “O Sir, <HI>said Strong-back, which was his
Name,</HI> I am extraordinary strong.” Then said
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> “Your gain must be great.” “Very little,
<HI>reply'd the Wood-Man,</HI> we are very poor in this
place; and every one does his own Work.” “Since
it is so, <HI>added the Knight,</HI> come along with me,
and you shall want nothing; and when you have
a mind to go home again, I will give you Money
to defray your Expences.” Which Proposal he
approved of, and left his Wedges and other
Tools, and follow'd his new Master.</P>
<P>When he had cross'd the Forest, he saw a Man
in the Plain, holding in his Hand Ribbons with
which he tied his Legs, leaving, one would think
or imagine, scarce liberty enough to walk. <HI>Com∣rade</HI>
stopt, and said to his Master, “This is another
gifted Man, you will have occasion for him,
therefore take him along with you.” At that
the fortunate Knight advanced towards him with
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
his natural Gracefulness, and ask'd him why he tied
his Legs so; “Oh, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> I am preparing for a
Hunt.” “How, <HI>said the Knight smiling,</HI> do you pre∣tend
to run best when you are so fetter'd?” “No,
Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> I don't pretend to run so fast; but
that is not my Intention, there are neither Stags
nor Hares, but what I out-run when my Legs
are at liberty; so that by always out-going them
they escape, and I seldom catch them.” “You
seem to me a very extraordinary Man, <HI>said the
Knight,</HI> what's your Name?” “<HI>Lightfoot, replied he,</HI>
and I am very well known in all this Country.”
“If you would see another, <HI>added our Hero,</HI> I should
be glad you would go with me; I will use you
very kindly.” Which Offer, <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> as he lived
but indifferently, accepted of with Thanks, and
follow'd the fortunate Knight.</P>
<P>The next day he met with a Man by a Marsh
side, binding his Eyes. The Horse said to his
Master, “I would advise you, Sir, to take this
Man into your Service.” <HI>Fortunio</HI> asked him what
made him bind his Eyes; to which he answer'd,
that he saw too clear; that he could see Game
above four Leagues; and that he never shot but he
kill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d always more than he desir'd; that he was
forced to bind his Eyes, lest he should destroy all
the Partridge, Pheasants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Country. “You
are a notable Man, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fortunio, what's your
Name? “They call me the <HI>Marksman, said he,</HI>
and I would not leave off that Employ for any
thing in the World.” “However, <HI>said the Knight,</HI> I
have a great Desire to propose to you to travel
along with me; it shall not hinder you from ex∣ercising
your Talent.” The <HI>Marksman</HI> raised some
Objections, and the Knight found it harder to get
his Consent than any of the rest; for these sort of
People are generally great Lovers of Liberty: how∣ever
he brought it about, and they all left the
Marsh together.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
After some days Journey they came by a long
Meadow, where he saw a Man laid all on one side
upon the ground. “Master, <HI>said</HI> Comrade, this is
a gifted Man, who will, I foresee, be very neces∣sary
to you.” <HI>Fortunio</HI> went into the Meadow,
and desired to know what he was doing. “I want
some Simples, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> and I am listening to the
Grass that is growing, to know if there are any
such as I want coming up.” “What, <HI>said the Knight,</HI>
is your Ear so quick as to hear the Grass grow,
and know what will come up?” Yes, <HI>replied he,</HI>
and for that reason I am called <HI>Fine-Ear.</HI>” “Well,
<HI>Fine-Ear, said</HI> Fortunio, have you an Inclination
to follow me? I will give you good Wages; you
shall have no reason to complain.” This Proposal
was so agreeable to him, he without any manner
of hesitation added himself to increase their num∣ber.</P>
<P>The Knight pursuing his Travels, saw by a great
Road-side a Man whose Cheeks were so blown up,
that he represented the Picture of <HI>Aeolus:</HI> he was
standing with his Face towards a high Hill about
two Leagues off, on which there stood fifty or sixty
Windmills. The Horse said to his Master, “There
is another of our gifted Men; do what you can
to take him along with you.” <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was
as engaging in his Person as Speech, accosted him,
and asked him what he was doing there. “I am
blowing a little, Sir, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> to set those
Mills at work.” “You seem too far off, <HI>said the
Knight.</HI>” “On the contrary, <HI>reply'd the Blower,</HI> I am
too nigh; if I did not hold in my breath, I should
overturn the Mills, and perhaps the Hill itself;
so that by this means I often do a great deal of
mischief against my will. I'll tell you Sir, I
was once in love, and very ill used by my Mistress,
and as I sigh'd in the Woods, my Sighs tore up
Trees by their Roots, and made such a havock,
that in this Country they call me the <HI>Boisterer.</HI>”
“If you are troublesome to them, <HI>said</HI> Fortunio,
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
go along with me; here are those that will bear
you company, who have each of them as extra∣ordinary
Talents.” “I have a natural Curiosity,
<HI>reply'd the Boisterer;</HI> and on that condition accept
of your Offer.”</P>
<P>Every thing succeeding thus to <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Desires,
he left this Place, and after crossing a thick inclo∣sed
Country, saw a large Lake into which several
Springs discharg'd their Waters; and by its side a
Man who looked very earnestly at him. “Sir, <HI>said</HI>
Comrade <HI>to his Master,</HI> this Man is wanting to
compleat your Equipage; it would be well if you
could engage him to follow you.” The Knight
went to him, and said, “Pray Friend what are you
doing there?” “You shall see, Sir, <HI>answer'd the Man,</HI>
as soon as this Lake is full, I will drink it up at
one Draught; for I am very dry, tho I have emp∣tied
it twice already.” Accordingly he stoop'd down,
and left scarce enough for the least Fish to swim
in. <HI>Fortunio</HI> and his Troop were all very much sur∣prized,
“What, <HI>said he,</HI> are you always thus thirsty?”
“No, <HI>said the Water-Drinker,</HI> only after eating salt
Meat, or upon any Wager. I am known by the
Name of <HI>Tippler.</HI>” “Come along with me, <HI>Tippler,
said the Knight,</HI> and you shall tipple Wine, which
you will like better than this Water.” This Pro∣mise
carried too great a Temptation with it, for
<HI>Tippler</HI> to withstand it, who immediately got up
and follow'd them.</P>
<P>The Knight had got within sight of the Place
of Rendevouz, where they were all to assemble,
when he perceived a Man who eat so greedily, that
tho he had sixty thousand Loaves of Bread before
him, he seem'd resolved not to leave one bit. <HI>Com∣rade</HI>
said to his Master, “Sir, you only want this
Man, pray engage him to go with you.” Upon
which the Knight made up to him, and smiling,
said, “Are you resolved to eat up all this Bread
at your Breakfast?” “Yes, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> and am vex'd
to see so little; these Bakers are a lazy sort of
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
People, who care not if one was starved.” “If
you eat as much every day, <HI>added</HI> Fortunio, you
are able to cause a Famine in any Country in the
World.” “Oh! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Grugeon, (which was
his Name, and which signifies a great Eater) I
should be sorry to have so great a Stomach, since
neither what I could get myself, nor what my
Neighbours had, would satisfy me: Indeed some∣times
I am glad to regale myself after this man∣ner.”
“Well, <HI>Grugeon, said the Knight,</HI> if you will
follow me, you shall not want for good Cheer,
nor repent your chusing me for your Master.”
<HI>Comrade,</HI> whose Sense and Foresight were of great
service to our Knight, told him, it would be pro∣per
that he forbid his Attendants from boasting of
their extraordinary Gifts; which he fail'd not to
do, and each of them swore they would punctually
obey his Commands. Soon after the Knight, whose
Beauty and good Mien far exceeded the Richness
of his Habit, enter'd the Capital City, mounted on
his excellent Horse, and follow'd by his seven Atten∣dants,
for whom he provided rich Liveries, laced
with Gold, and good Horses; and going to the best
Inn, stay'd there till the day appointed for the
Review: all which time he was the Subject of the
Discourse of the whole City, insomuch that the
King hearing of him, had a great desire to see
him.</P>
<P>The Troops assembled on a large Plain, the
King, and his Sister the Queen-Dowager, came to
review them. She abated in no wise her Pomp
and State, notwithstanding the Troubles of the
Kingdom; but dazled <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Eyes with the
Riches with which she was adorn'd: whose Beauty
had the same effect upon that noble Train, as her
Magnificence had on him. Every body enquired
who that handsome young Knight was; and the
King himself, as he pass'd by, made a sign for him
to come to him. <HI>Fortunio</HI> alighted from off his
Horse, to make the King a low Bow, but at the
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
same time could not forbear blushing, seeing him
look so earnestly at him, which gave a great Lu∣stre
to his Complexion. “I should be glad, <HI>said the
King,</HI> to know who you are, and your Name.”
“Sir, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> I am call'd <HI>Fortunio,</HI> tho I have
no reason to bear that Name, since my Father is
an old Count, that lives on the Frontiers; who,
tho he is a Man of Birth, has no Estate.” “Tho
Fortune may have proved unkind hitherto, <HI>an∣swer'd
the King,</HI> she has made an amends, by bring∣ing
you hither; I have a particular Affection for
you, and remember that your Father did mine
some signal Services, which I will recompence in
you.” “It is just you should, <HI>said the Queen-Dowager,
who had not yet open'd her Lips:</HI> and as I am older
than you, Brother, I remember more particularly
than you do, what great things the old Count
perform'd in the Service of his Country; there∣fore
I desire I may have the Care of the Prefer∣ment
of this young Knight.”</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio,</HI> overjoy'd at this Reception, could not
thank the King and Queen enough; and durst
not enlarge too much on the Sentiments of
his Acknowledgment, thinking it more respectful
to hold his tongue, than to speak too much, tho
what he did say was so proper and well adapted,
that every one commended him. Afterwards he
mounted his Horse again, and mix'd among the
Lords and Gentlemen who attended on the King;
when the Queen calling him often to ask him Que∣stions,
and turning herself towards <HI>Florida,</HI> who was
her Confidant, said to her softly, “What do you
think of this young Spark? can there be a more
noble Air, and more regular Features? I must
confess, I never in my life saw any thing more
lovely.” <HI>Florida</HI>'s Sentiments differ'd not from her
Mistres's, she praised him even to Exaggeration.
Our Knight could not forbear casting his Eyes often
on the King, who was not only a handsome Prince,
but in all his Ways was engaging; and our Female
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Warriour, tho she had changed her Habit, had not
renounced her Sex, but was sensible of his Merit.
The King told <HI>Fortunio</HI> after the Review, that he
was afraid the War would be very bloody, there∣fore
he was resolved always to keep him nigh his
own Person. The Queen-Dowager, who was then
by, said, she was just thinking that he ought not
to be exposed to the Dangers of a long Campaign,
and that as the Place of Steward of her Houshold
was vacant, she would give it to him. “No, <HI>said
the King,</HI> I will make him Master of the Horse to
myself.” Thus they disputed who should prefer
<HI>Fortunio;</HI> when the Queen, fearing lest she should
too much betray the secret Emotions of her Heart,
yielded to the King.</P>
<P>There was never a day but <HI>Fortunio</HI> call'd for his
Turky-leather Trunk, and took a new Dress; by
which means he appear'd more magnificent than
all the Princes at the Court: insomuch that the
Queen ask'd him often how his Father could af∣ford
to be at so vast an Expence. Sometimes she
banter'd him, and said, “Come, confess truly you
have a Mistress, who supports you in all this Fi∣nery.”
Upon which <HI>Fortunio</HI> would blush, and ex∣cuse
himself the best he could. He acquitted him∣self
admirably well in his Post, and his Heart,
which was sensible of a Tenderness for the King,
attach'd him more to his Person than he wish'd to
be: “What is my Fate, <HI>said our Knight,</HI> I love a
great and powerful King, without any hopes of
the like Return, or that he should have any re∣gard
for the Pains I endure.” The King loaded
him with his Favours, he thought nothing well
done, but what was done by the handsome Knight,
and the Queen, deceiv'd by his Habit, thought se∣riously
of marrying him; but the Inequality of
their Birth was the only obstacle that stood in her
way. Neither was she the only Person that was
taken with the beautiful <HI>Fortunio,</HI> all the fine La∣dies
of the Court sigh'd for him. He was conti∣nually
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
pester'd with tender Letters, Appointments
for Rendevouz's, Presents, and a thousand other
Gallantries; which he answer'd with all imagina∣ble
Indifference, which made them suspect he had
left a Mistress behind him in his own Country.
At all Tournaments he won the Prize, and in
Hunting, or any other Sport, kill'd more Game
than all the Company besides, and danced at all
Balls more gracefully than all the Courtiers; in
short, he charmed all who saw and heard him.</P>
<P>The Queen, that she might not be obliged to
declare her Sentiments to him herself, charged <HI>Flo∣rida</HI>
to let him understand, that such Marks of
Bounty from a young Queen ought not to be so
carelesly receiv'd. <HI>Florida,</HI> who had not been able
to avoid the Fate of most that had seen this Knight,
was very much embarass'd with this Commission,
he appear'd too lovely in her Eyes, for her to think
of preferring her Mistress's Interest before her own;
insomuch that whenever the Queen gave her an
opportunity of discoursing with him, instead of
speaking of the Beauty and great Qualifications of
that Princess, she told him how ill-humour'd she
was, how much her Women endured with her,
how unjust she was, and the ill use she made of
the great Power she had usurped; and at last com∣paring
Sentiments, said, “Tho I was not born to
be a Queen, I ought to have been one, since I
have a great and generous Soul, that induces me
to do good to every body. Oh! <HI>continued she,</HI> was
I in that high Station, how happy would I make
the charming <HI>Fortunio!</HI> He should love me out of
Gratitude, if he could not love me thro Inclina∣tion.”</P>
<P>The young Knight was entirely at a loss, and
knew not what Answer to make, but ever after
carefully avoided having any private Discourse with
her; while the impatient Queen never fail'd to ask
<HI>Florida</HI> how far she had wrought on <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who
said to her, “He is, Madam, so timorous, that he
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
will not believe any thing that I tell him favoura∣bly
from you, or pretends not to believe it, be∣cause
he is engaged in some other Passion.” “I
believe so too, <HI>said the alarm'd Queen;</HI> but is it pos∣sible
his Love should hold out against his Ambi∣tion?”
“And can you, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Florida,
bear the thoughts of owing his Heart to your
Crown? Ought a Princess so young and beauti∣ful
as you are, to have recourse to a Diadem?”
“Yes, to every thing, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI> when it is to
subdue a rebellious Heart.” By this <HI>Florida</HI> knew
very well, that it was impossible to cure her Mi∣stress
of her Passion. The Queen waited every
day for some happy effect from the Cares of her
Confidant; but the small Progress she made on
<HI>Fortunio</HI> obliged her to find out other ways to dis∣course
with him. As she knew that he went early
every morning into a little Wood, into which the
Windows of her Apartment look'd; she arose with
the Morning, and looking out, she perceiv'd him
walking in a careless melancholy Air; and calling
<HI>Florida,</HI> said to her, “What you told me appears
but too true; <HI>Fortunio,</HI> without dispute, is in love
with some Lady, either in this Court, or in his
own Country: observe but the Sadness which
hangs on his Face.” “I have taken notice of it
in all the Conversation I have had with him, <HI>re∣ply'd</HI>
Florida; therefore, Madam, it would be well
if you could forget him.” “It is now too late,
<HI>cry'd the Queen, fetching a deep Sigh;</HI> but if he goes
into that green Arbour, we will go to him.” <HI>Flo∣rida</HI>
durst in no wise offer to oppose the Queen,
tho she had a great desire to it; for she was cru∣elly
afraid she should be loved by <HI>Fortunio,</HI> knowing
a Rival of her Rank to be always dangerous. When
the Queen came within some small distance of the
Arbour, she heard the Knight, whose Voice was
very agreeable, sing these words:
<Q><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<L>In vain, soft Ease, the Love-toss'd Heart pursues,</L>
<L>Even in possession of the long-sought Joy,</L>
<L>We rob the bounteous God of half his Dues,</L>
<L>And <HI>future</HI> Fears the <HI>present</HI> Bliss destroy.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> made these Lines, with relation to the
Sentiment wherewith the young King had inspired
her, the Favours she had received from that Prince,
and the Apprehensions she was under, lest she
should be known, and be forced to leave a Court,
which she chose to live in sooner than any other
Place in the World. The Queen, who stopped to
hear her, was in a cruel Uneasiness: “What am I
going to attempt? <HI>said she softly to</HI> Florida: this
young Ungrate despises the honour of pleasing me▪
thinks himself happy, seems content with his
Conquest, and sacrifices me to another.” “He is
now at that Age, <HI>answer'd</HI> Florida, when Reason
has not fully established itself; if I durst give
your Majesty Advice, it should be to forget him,
since he knows not how to value his good For∣tune.”
The Queen, who would have been better
pleased that her Confidant had spoke after another
manner, cast an angry Eye upon her, and advan∣cing
forwards, went directly into the Arbour where
the Knight was; and pretended to be surprized to
find him there, and to be vexed he should see her
in a Dishabille, tho' at the same time she had
neglected nothing that was rich and gallant. As
soon as he saw her, he was for retiring, out of Re∣spect;
but she bid him stay, that she might lean on
him back again. “I was this morning, <HI>said she,</HI>
agreeably awakened by the Warblings of the Birds,
and the Freshness of the Air invited me to come
nigher to them. Alas! how happy are they! they
know nought but Pleasures, they know no Trou∣bles.”
“I am of opinion, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fortu∣nio,
that they are not absolutely exempt from
Troubles and Disquiets, they are always in danger
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
of the murdering Shot and Snares of Sportsmen,
besides that of the Birds of Prey, which make a
cruel War upon them; and then again, when a
hard and severe Winter congeals the Earth, and
covers it with Snow, they die for want of Food,
and are every year put to the trouble of seeking out
a new Mistress.” “Do you think it then a trouble?
<HI>said the Queen smiling?</HI> There are Men who do it
every month.” “What, <HI>continued she,</HI> you seem
surprized, and as if your Heart was not of this
stamp, and that you have not hitherto been given
to change.” “I cannot yet tell, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI>
what I may be capable of, since I was never sen∣sible
of Love; but I dare believe, if I should be,
my Passion would be lasting. “You have never
been in love! <HI>cry'd the Queen, looking so earnestly at
him, that the poor Knight blushed;</HI> you have not been
in love? O <HI>Fortunio!</HI> how can you tell a Queen so,
who reads in your Face and Eyes the Passion that
possesses your Heart, and which your own words,
which you sung to a new-fashioned Tune, have in∣formed
me of. Indeed, Madam, <HI>answered the
Knight,</HI> the Lines were mine, but I made them
without any particular Design; for my Companions
and Acquaintance engage me to make drinking
Catches, tho I drink nought but Water, and ten∣der
and passionate Songs: so that I sing both Love
and <HI>Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus,</HI> tho' I am neihter a Lover nor a
Drinker.”</P>
<P>The Queen listened to him with that Concern,
that she could hardly contain herself. What he
said, rekindled in her Heart the Hope <HI>Florida</HI> woud
have banished: “If I could think you sincere, <HI>said
she,</HI> I should have reason to be surprized, that
you have not yet found in this Court a Lady a∣miable
enough for to fix your Choice.” “Madam,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Fortunio, I have so much to do in the Of∣fice
I am in, I have no time to throw away in
sighing.” “Then you love nothing? <HI>added she with
eagerness.</HI>” “No, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> I have not a
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Heart of so gallant a Character, I am a kind of
Misanthropos, that loves my Liberty, and would
not lose it for all the World.” The Queen sat
herself down, and fixing her Eyes most obligingly
on him, reply'd, “There are some Chains so easy
and glorious to bear, that if Fortune has destined
any such for you, I would advise you to renounce
your Liberty.” In all this Discourse her Eyes ex∣plained
her Thoughts but too intelligibly for our
Knight, whose Suspicions were too great before not
to be confirmed in them; and fearing lest the Con∣versation
should go too far, he pulled out his
Watch, and setting the Hand forward, said, “I beg
of your Majesty to give me leave to go to the Pa∣lace,
it is the King's time of rising, and he or∣dered
me to be at his Levee.” “Go, indifferent
Youth, <HI>said she, fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> you are in the
right to pay Court to my Brother; but remem∣ber
it would not be amiss to let me have some
share of your Devoirs.” The Queen followed him
with her Eyes, then lowering them, and reflecting
on what had passed, blushed with Shame and Rage;
and what troubled her most, was, <HI>Florida</HI>'s being a
Witness, and the joyful Air that appeared all over
her Countenance, which was as much as to say,
she had better have taken her Advice than spoke to
<HI>Fortunio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Florida</HI> acted her part very well with the Queen,
and comforted her the best she could, giving her some
flattering hopes, of which at that time she stood in
great need? “<HI>Fortunio,</HI> Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> thinks
himself so much beneath you, that perhaps he
did not understand what you mean, and I think
he has assured you he loves no Person.” As it is
natural for us to flatter ourselves, the Queen, reco∣vered
somewhat out of her fears, not dreaming in the
least that the malicious <HI>Florida</HI> was engaging her to
declare herself more plainly, that he might offend
her the more by the Indifference of his Answers.
The Knight, for his part, was in the utmost Con∣fusion,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
the Situation he was in seemed cruel, and
he would have made no difficulty to have left the
Court, had not the fatal Stroke, wherewith the lit∣tle
God had wounded his Heart, detained him in
spite of himself. He never came near the Queen
but on Drawing-Room Nights, and when with the
King; and as soon as she perceived this new Change
in his Behaviour, she gave him often the most fa∣vourable
Opportunities to make his Court to her,
which he as often neglected; when one day, as
she was going down some steps into the Garden,
she saw him crossing a large Alley, and making to∣wards
the Wood: upon which calling to him, he,
lest she should be displeased, came to her, and pre∣tended
that he did not see her. “You remember,
Knight, <HI>said she,</HI> the Conversation we had some
time since in the Green Arbour.” “I am not, Ma∣dam,
<HI>answer'd he,</HI> capable of forgetting that Ho∣nour.”
“Then without doubt, <HI>said she,</HI> the Ques∣tions
I put to you were not very pleasing; for
since that day, you would not let it be in my
power to ask you any more.” “As Chance alone,
<HI>answer'd he,</HI> procured me that Favour, I thought
it would be too great Boldness to pretend to any
other.” “Say rather, ungrateful Man, <HI>continu'd she
blushing,</HI> you have avoided my Presence. You
know my Sentiments but too well.” <HI>Fortunio</HI> thro
Modesty and Confusion lower'd his Eyes, and as
he did not make a quick Reply, “You are very much
confounded, <HI>said she;</HI> go, seek not for an Answer,
I understand you better than I would.” She had
perhaps said a great deal more, but that she per∣ceived
the King coming that way; whereupon she
made towards him, and seeing him pensive and me∣lancholy,
conjured him to tell her the Reason.
“You know, <HI>said the King,</HI> that I have received Ad∣vice
this Month of a Dragon of a prodigious size,
that ravages the whole Country. I thought he
might be killed, and to that end gave necessary
Orders; but all that has been tried has proved in
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
vain. He devours my Subjects and their Flocks,
and all that comes nigh him; he poisons all the
Rivers and Lakes he drinks at, and wherever he
lies, withers all the Grass and Herbs about him.”</P>
<P>While the King was making this Complaint, the
inraged Queen was thinking how she might sa∣crifice
the Knight to her Resentment, “I am not
unacquainted with the ill News you have received;
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> whom you saw with me, informed me
thereof: but, Brother, you will be surprized at
what I have to tell you; he has begged of me,
with the greatest Importunity, to ask you leave
to let him go to fight this terrible Dragon, in∣deed
he has a wonderful Address, and handles
his Arms so well, that I am not so much amazed
at his presuming so much of himself; besides, he
has told me he has a Secret, by which he can
lay the most wakeful Dragons asleep: but that
must not be mentioned, because it shews not so
much Courage in the Action.” “Be it how it will,
<HI>reply'd the King,</HI> it will be glorious for him, and of
great service to us, if he should succeed; but I am
afraid this proceeds from an indiscreet Zeal, and
that it should cost him his Life.” “No, Brother,
<HI>added the Queen,</HI> fear not, he has told me very
surprizing things on this Subject. You know he
is naturally very sincere, and besides what Ho∣nour
can he hope to gain by throwing away his
Life rashly? In short, <HI>continued she,</HI> I have pro∣mised
to obtain for him what he so earnestly de∣sires,
and if you refuse him, you will break his
Heart.” “I consent, <HI>said the King,</HI> yet I must own,
not very freely: however, let us call him.” And
thereupon making a sign for him to come to him,
said to him in an obliging manner, “I understand
by the Queen, you have a great desire to fight
the Dragon, that preys so much on our Country;
which is so bold a Resolution, that I can scarce∣ly
believe you know the Danger you run.” “I
have represented that already to him, <HI>answer'd
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
the Queen,</HI> but his Zeal for your Service, and his
Desire to signalize himself, are so great, that no∣thing
can dissuade him from it; and therefore I
foresee some happy Success will attend him.”</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was very much surprized to hear the
King and Queen talk after this manner, and had
too much Sense not to penetrate into the ill De∣signs
of that Princess; but his Sweetness of Tem∣per
would not suffer him to explain himself: so
without returning any Answer, he let her talk on,
while he made low Bows, which the King took
for so many new Intreaties to grant what he so much
desired. “Go, <HI>said the King sighing,</HI> go where Honour
calls; I know you do every thing so well, and
have particularly so much Courage and Conduct,
that this Monster will not be able to escape your
Arms.” “Sir, <HI>answered the Knight,</HI> however For∣tune
decides the Fight, I shall be satisfied, since
I shall either deliver you from a terrible Scourge,
or die in your Service: but honour me with one
favour, which will be infinitely dear to me.”
“Ask what you would have, <HI>said the King.</HI>” “Then
let me be so bold, <HI>continued he,</HI> as to beg your Pic∣ture.”
The King was mightily pleased, that he
should think of his Picture at a time when his
Thoughts might have been employed on so many
other important things, and the Queen was cha∣grined
anew, that he had not made the same Re∣quest
to her. The King returned to his Palace,
and the Queen to hers, and <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was not
a little embarassed on his Word which he had gi∣ven,
went to his Horse: “Comrade, <HI>said he,</HI> I have
strange News to tell you.” “I know it, Sir, al∣ready,
<HI>reply'd the Horse.</HI>” “What shall we then do?
<HI>added</HI> Fortunio.” “We must go as soon as possible,
<HI>answer'd the Horse;</HI> get the King's Commission,
whereby he orders you to fight the Dragon, and
afterwards we will do our Duty.” These words
were very comfortable to our young Knight, who
failed not to wait on the King early the next Morn∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
in a campaigning Habit, as handsome and gal∣lant
as any of his others.</P>
<P>As soon as the King saw him, he cry'd out, “What
are you ready to go?” “Yes, Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> one
cannot make too much haste to execute your
Commands, therefore I am come to take my leave
of you.” The King could not but relent, seeing
so young, so beautiful, and so accomplished a
Knight, then going to expose himself to the grea∣test
Danger Man could ever undergo; he embraced
him, and gave him his Picture set in Diamonds,
which <HI>Fortunio</HI> received with extraordinary Joy;
for the King's great Qualities had such an effect
upon him, that he could not think any so lovely as
him; and if he had any Reluctancy to go, it pro∣ceeded
more from being deprived of his Presence,
than his Fear of being devoured by the Dragon.
The King would have a general Order included in
<HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Commission, for all his Subjects to aid and
assist him, whenever he should stand in need. Af∣terwards
he took his leave of the King, and that
nothing might be remarked in his Behaviour, went
also to the Queen, who was sat at her Toilet, sur∣rounded
by a great number of Ladies. She changed
Colour as soon as ever she saw him, so much had
she to reproach herself withal; he saluted her re∣spectfully,
and asked her, if she would honour
him with her Commands, since he was just then
going. These last words put her into the ut∣most
Consternation, while <HI>Florida,</HI> who knew not
what the Queen had plotted against the Knight,
remained like one Thunder-struck, and would wil∣lingly
have had some private Discourse with him,
but that he avoided it as much as possible: “I be∣seech
Heaven, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> that you may con∣quer,
and return in Triumph.” “Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Knight,</HI> your Majesty honours me too much,
and, I am sensible, knows very well the Danger
to which I shall be exposed; yet I have a great
deal of Confidence, and perhaps am the only Per∣son
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
that entertains any hopes on this occasion.”
The Queen understood very well what he meant,
and, without dispute, had returned him some An∣swer
to this Reproach, had there not been so many
Witnesses present.</P>
<P>The Knight afterwards went away, and ordered
his seven notable Domesticks to take horse, and fol∣low
him, because the time was then come to make
proof of what they could do. They all expressed
their Joy to serve him, and got every thing done in
less than an hour's time, and went along with him,
assuring him, that they would neglect nothing they
could do to serve him; and when they were out in
the Country, shewed their Address. <HI>Trinquet</HI> drank
up the Lakes and Ponds, and catched delicate Fish
for his Master's Dinner; <HI>Lightfoot</HI> hunted down Veni∣son,
and catched Hares by the Ears; and for the
good <HI>Marksman,</HI> he neither gave Partridge nor
Pheasant any Quarter; and whatever Game they
killed, <HI>Strongback</HI> carried it. By this means <HI>Fortunio</HI>
had no occasion to draw his Purse-strings all his
Journey, and might have had very good Diversion,
if his Thoughts had been less employed on those he
left behind him. The King's Merit was always in
his mind, and the Queen's Malice appeared so great,
that he could not but detest her. Thus he travelled
all the way very thoughtful, till he was rouzed
from his Musings by the Shrieks of poor Peasants half
devoured by the Dragon; some, that had escaped,
he saw flying as fast as they could, who would not
stop nor stay, which obliged him to ride after them
to get intelligence. After he had talked with them,
and learnt that the Dragon was not far off, he ask'd
them how they secured themselves from him. To
which they answered, “That as Water was very scarce
in that Country, and that they had none but what
they preserved when it rained in Ponds; at which
the Dragon, when he went his Rounds, came to
drink, making a terrible Noise and Roaring,
which might be heard a League off; that then
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
every body hid themselves, and shut their Doors
and Windows.</P>
<P>The Knight went into an Inn, not so much to
rest himself, as to advise with his Horse: When
every one was retired, and gone to rest, he went
into the Stable, and said, “<HI>Comrade,</HI> how shall we
conquer this Dragon?” To which the Horse re∣ply'd,
“Sir, I will dream to-night, and give you an
account in the morning.” Accordingly next
morning, when he came again, he said, “Let <HI>Fine-Ear</HI>
listen whether the Dragon is nigh at hand, or
not.” <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> laid himself on the Ground, and
heard the Dragon about seven Leagues off. When
the Horse was informed of this, he said to <HI>Fortunio,</HI>
“Bid <HI>Trirquet</HI> go and drink up all the Water out of
a large Pond, and <HI>Strongback</HI> carry Wine enough
to fill it; then let there be dry'd Raisins, pep∣pered
and salted Meats set by it: afterwards or∣der
all the Inhabitants to keep their Houses, and
likewise do you and your Attendants the same;
the Dragon will not fail to go eat and drink, he
will like the Wine, and you will see what will
happen.” No sooner had the Horse thus appointed
what was to be done, but every one did what he was
ordered: The Knight went to a House, from
whence he might see the Pond; and was no sooner
within the doors, but the Dragon came and drank
a little: afterwards he eat some of that Repast pre∣pared
for him, and then drank so much, that he
was quite drunk, insomuch that he could not stir.
He was laid on one side, with his Head hanging
down, and his Eyes shut. When <HI>Fortunio</HI> saw him
in this Condition, he thought proper to lose no
time, but went out with his Sword in his hand,
and attacked him. The Dragon, finding himself
wounded on all sides, would have got up, and fell
upon the Knight; but had not strength, he had lost
so much Blood. The Knight, overjoyed that he
had reduced him to this extremity, called his At∣tendants
to bind this Monster, that the King might
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
have the Honour and Pleasure of putting an end to
his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, and that being so bound, he might be car∣ried
without danger to the capital City.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> marched at the head of his little Troop,
and when he was within some few hours march of
the Palace, he sent <HI>Lightfoot</HI> to acquaint the King
with the good News of his Success; which seemed
almost incredible, till the Monster appeared bound
fast upon a Machine fit for that purpose. The King
went to <HI>Fortunio,</HI> embraced him, and said, “The
Gods have reserved this Victory for you, I am not
sensible of half so much Joy to see this Monster in
this Condition, as to see my dear Knight again.”
“Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> your Majesty yourself may give the
last Blow, I brought him hither on purpose that
he might receive it at your hand.” At that the
King drew his Sword, and killed this his most cruel
Enemy, while all the People gave Shouts and Ac∣clamations
of Joy at so little expected Success.
<HI>Florida,</HI> who, during his Absence, had not enjoyed
many quiet hours, was not long before she was in∣formed
of her charming Knight's return, and ran
to tell the Queen; who was so much surprized and
confounded thro Love and Hatred, that she could
return no Answer to what her Favourite told her,
but reproached herself a thousand times for the ill
turn she had plaid him; but then again would have
been better pleased to have heard of his Death, than
to see him so indifferent: insomuch that she knew
not whether she should be vexed or pleased at his
Return to Court, where his Presence might disturb
her Repose. The King, impatient, to tell her the
happy Success of so extraordinary an Adventure,
went into her Chamber, leaning on the Knight,
“Here is the Man, <HI>said he,</HI> that has vanquished the
Dragon, and has done me the greatest Service I
could desire from the most faithful Subject. 'Twas
to you, Madam, that he first spoke of his Desire
to fight that Monster, and I hope you will re∣spect
him for the Danger to which he exposed him∣self.”
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
The Queen, composing her Countenance,
honoured <HI>Fortunio</HI> with a gracious Reception, and a
thousand Praises, found him much more lovely
than when he went away, and gave him to under∣stand
how much her Heart was wounded, by look∣ing
so earnestly at him.</P>
<P>But not satisfied with explaining her Sentiments
by her Eyes, one day, as she was an hunting with
the King, she pretended to be out of order, that
she could not follow the Dogs; and turning herself
towards the young Knight, who was just by her,
said to him, “You will do me a pleasure to stay
with me, for I have a mind to a-lit, and rest
myself a little.” Then bidding those who attended
on her go forwards, she and <HI>Florida</HI> alit, and sat
down by a Brook-side, where she remained some
time in a profound Silence, thinking on what she
should say. Afterwards lifting up her Eyes, and
fixing them on the Knight, she said, “As good In∣tentions
do not always shew themselves, I am
afraid you have not penetrated into the Motives
that engaged me to press the King to send you to
fight the Dragon. I was assured by a Foreknow∣ledge,
that never deceives me, that you would be∣have
yourself with Bravery, of which your Ene∣mies
spoke very indifferently, because you went
not to the Army, that you lay under a necessity
of performing some such illustrious Action as this
to stop their mouths. I should have acquainted
you, <HI>continued she,</HI> with what they said on this
Subject, or ought to have done it, but that I was
persuaded your Resentment would be attended
with some fatal Consequences, and that it would
be better to silence your Enemies by your Intre∣pidity
in Danger, than by an Authority that
would shew more of the Favourite than the Sol∣dier.”
“The Distance between us is so great, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd he modestly,</HI> that I am not worthy of
this Explanation, nor the care you took to ha∣zard
my Life for the sake of my Honour. Hea∣ven
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
has protected me more than my Enemies
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for, and I shall esteem myself always hap∣py
to venture for the King, and your Service, a
Life which is more indifferent to me than some
People imagine.”</P>
<P>This respectful Reproach embarassed the Queen,
who understood very well what he meant; but she
thought him too amiable to exasperate him by too
severe a Reply. On the contrary, she pretended
to be of his opinion, and told him again, how glo∣riously
he had slain the Dragon. <HI>Fortunio</HI> had been
so cautious, as to let no Person know that it was
owing to the Assistance of his Retinue, but boasted
of his meeting that terrible Enemy barefaced, and
that the Victory was gained entirely by his Cou∣rage.
In the mean time the Queen, who thought
not much on what he was telling her, interrupted
him, to ask him, if he was satisfied how much she
was interested in his Safety; and that Conversa∣tion
had been carried further, but he said, “Ma∣dam,
the King is coming this way, I hear the
Horn, and will not your Majesty be pleased
to mount again?” “No, <HI>said she, with an Air of
Rage,</HI> it is enough that you go.” “The King, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> will blame me for leaving you a∣lone,
in a place exposed to so many Dangers.”
“I dispense with this your Care, <HI>added she, in a
haughty Tone;</HI> go, your Presence is troublesome.”
At that the Knight made a low Bow, mounted his
Horse, and rid out of sight, very much concerned at
the Consequences that might attend this new Re∣sentment.
Upon this he consulted his Horse: “Tell
me, <HI>Comrade, said he,</HI> whether this love-sick pas∣sionate
Queen will find out another Monster for
me?” “No other besides herself, <HI>reply'd the Horse,</HI>
but she is still more dangerous than the Dragon
you have killed, and will exercise both your Pa∣tience
and Virtue sufficiently.” “Will she make me
lose the King's Favour, <HI>said he,</HI> for that's all I am
afraid of.” “I cannot tell you what will happen
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
in relation to that, <HI>said Comrade,</HI> it is enough that
I am always upon the Watch.” There was no
more said then, because the King appeared, and
<HI>Fortunio</HI> went to him, and told him the Queen was
indisposed, and had ordered him to stay with her.
“I think, <HI>said the King smiling,</HI> you are very much
in her favour, and declare your Mind more pre∣ferably
to her than me; I have not yet forgot your
Request, to procure you leave to fight the Dra∣gon.”
“Sir, <HI>answered the Knight,</HI> I dare not pre∣tend
to clear myself from what you alledge a∣gainst
me: but I can assure your Majesty, I look
upon your Favour and the Queen's with a great
deal of difference; and was a Subject allowed to
make his Sovereign his Considant, I should do my∣self
an infinite Pleasure to declare to you the Sen∣timents
of my Heart.” Here the King interrupted
him, to know where he had left the Queen, who
all the time of their Discourse was complaining to
<HI>Florida</HI> of <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Indifference. “The sight of him,
<HI>cry'd she,</HI> is hateful to me, either he or I must
leave the Court, for I cannot bear that such an
ungrateful Wretch should shew me so much Dis∣dain:
What Man would not think himself happy
to please so powerful a Queen? He is the only
Person whom the Gods have reserved to disturb the
Repose of my Life.” <HI>Florida</HI> was in no wise dis∣pleased
to see her Mistress so chagrined, but in∣stead
of appeasing her, rather aggravated, by re∣calling
to her remembrance a thousand Circum∣stances,
which she perhaps would not have taken
notice of: which increased her Rage, and made her
think on a new Project to ruin the poor Knight.</P>
<P>When the King came to her, he express'd his
Concern for her Health; to which she said, “I
must own I was very ill, but one cannot be long
so, when <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s by, he is so merry, and his
Jests are so diverting: But you must know, <HI>conti∣nued
she,</HI> he has desired me to ask another Favour
of your Majesty. He insists with the utmost con∣fidence,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
that he shall succeed in one of the most
rash Enterprizes imaginable.” “What, <HI>cry'd the
King,</HI> would he fight with some new Dragon?”
“With a great many at once, <HI>said she,</HI> and makes
as if he was sure to conquer. I will tell you;
in short, he boasts to make the Emperor restore
to us all our Treasures, and to do it without an
Army.” “What a pity is this, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> that
this poor Boy should be guilty of so much Extra∣vagance?”
“His Victory over the Dragon, <HI>added
the Queen,</HI> has puffed him up; and what do you
hazard, in giving him leave to expose himself a∣gain
for your service?” “I hazard his Life, which
is dear to me, <HI>reply'd the King;</HI> I should be very
sorry to be the occasion of his Death.” To this
the Queen answer'd. That his Desire was so great,
that if he was refused, he would languish and die
away. The King upon this look'd melancholy, and
said, “I cannot imagine who it is that fills his Head
with these Chimeras; it is unknown what I en∣cure
to see him in this condition.” “Why the
matter is, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> he has fought a Dra∣gon,
and been victorious, perhaps he may succeed
as well in this; I have often a very just Foresight,
and my Mind now tells me, that this Undertaking
will not be unfortunate: therefore, Brother, op∣pose
not his Zeal.” “Let him be call'd then, <HI>said
the King,</HI> and his Dangers be represented to him.”
“That's the way to make him despair, <HI>reply'd the
Queen;</HI> he will believe you to be against his go∣ing,
and I can assure you he is not to be de∣tain'd
by any Consideration that regards himself:
for I said all that can be thought on that Subject.”
“Well, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> I consent.” Upon this, the
Queen was overjoy'd, and call'd <HI>Fortunio</HI> in; “Go,
Knight, <HI>said she,</HI> and thank the King; he has
granted the leave, you so much desired, to go to
the Emperor <HI>Matapa,</HI> and make him, by fair means
or force, restore our Treasures: Make the same
dispatch, as when you went to fight the Dra∣gon.”</P>

<HI>Fortunio</HI> at first was surprized, but was soon sen∣sible
that this proceeded from the Queen's Rage;
however, he felt a secret Pleasure, in being able
to lay down his Life for a Prince that was so dear
to him: and without excusing himself from such an
extraordinary Commission, kneel'd on one Knee,
and kiss'd the King's Hand, whose Heart at that in∣stant
relented. The Queen felt an inward Shame,
to see with what respect he behaved himself, tho
sent to meet a certain Death. “Would to Heaven,
<HI>said she to herself,</HI> he had any regard for me; how
noble is it, not to contradict what I have ad∣vanced,
but rather to bear the ill turn I have
done him, than complain!” The King said little
to the Knight, but mounted his Horse again; and
the Queen, pretending all that time to be ill, went
into her Chaise. <HI>Fortunio</HI> accompany'd them to the
end of the Forest, and afterwards return'd back, to
have some discourse with his Horse: “My faithful
<HI>Contrade, said he,</HI> 'tis done, I must die, the Queen
has compleated that which I never expected from
her.” “My lovely Master, <HI>reply'd the Horse,</HI> fright
not yourself, tho I have not been present at what
has pass'd, I know all; the Embassy is not so ter∣rible
as you imagine.” “You don't know, <HI>conti∣nued
the Knight,</HI> that this Emperor is the most pas∣sionate
of all Men, and that if I propose, that he
restore what he has taken from the King my Ma∣ster,
he will return me no other Answer, than order
a Stone to be tied about my Neck, and that I be
thrown into a River.” “I am not uninform'd of
his Violence, <HI>said</HI> Comrade: but that does not
hinder you from taking your People along with
you, and if we perish, it shall be one and all;
but I hope for better Success.”</P>
<P>The Knight return'd home somewhat comforted,
where he gave the necessary Orders, and after∣wards
went to receive his Credentials. “Tell the
Emperor, <HI>said the King,</HI> that I remand back all
my Subjects he has in Slavery, all my Soldiers
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
that are Prisoners, all my Horses, and other Goods
and Treasure.” “What must I offer him for all
this? <HI>said</HI> Fortunio.” “Nothing, <HI>answer'd the King,</HI>
but my Friendship.” The young Ambassador had
no occasion for a great Memory to keep these
Instructions in his mind: he went without seeing
the Queen, at which she was very angry; but
he had no reason to regard that, for what could
she do more in the height of her Rage, than what
she had accomplish'd in the greatest Transports of
Friendship? And a Tenderness of this kind was to
him the most formidable thing in the World. Nay,
her Confidant, who knew the whole Secret, was
enraged against her Mistress, for striving to sacri∣fice
the Flower of all Knighthood. <HI>Fortunio</HI> took
whatever was necessary for his Journey out of his
Turkey-leather Trunk, and was not content to
clothe himself magnificently, but his seven Servants
also; and as they had all excellent Horses, and <HI>Com∣rade</HI>
seem'd rather to fly than run, they arrived
soon at the Emperor's Capital, which was no ways
inferior to any City of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was very much surprized to see a Town
of such a large Extent. He demanded an Audience
of the Emperor, and had it granted; but when he
declared the Subject of his Embassy, tho it was
with a Grace that gave force to his Arguments,
the Emperor could not help smiling. “Were you
at the Head of five hundred thousand Men, <HI>said
he,</HI> one might hearken to you; whereas, I am
told, you have only seven.” “I never undertook,
Sir, <HI>said</HI> Fortunio, to compel you by force of
Arms, but only by my Remonstrances.” “Whatever
those be, <HI>added the Emperor,</HI> you shall never bring
them to bear, unless you will do a thing that is
just now come into my head; that is, to find a
Man that can eat for his Breakfast as much hot
Bread as serves this City for a whole Day.” The
Knight at this Proposition seem'd overjoy'd, and
as he spoke not presently, the Emperor burst out
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
into a Laughter. “Sir, <HI>said</HI> Fortunio, I accept of
your Proposition, and will bring to-morrow a
Man, who shall not only eat all the new Bread,
but also the stale; order it to be brought out, and
you shall have the pleasure of seeing him lick up
the very Crumbs.” The Emperor said he con∣sented,
and all the Discourse of that Day run up∣on
the Folly of this Ambassador, whom <HI>Matapa</HI>
swore he would put to death, if he was not as good
as his word. When he returned back to the House
where Ambassadors were lodged, he called <HI>Grugeon,</HI>
and told what had pass'd between him and the Em∣peror.
“Never be uneasy, Master, <HI>said</HI> Grugeon,
I will eat till they shall be tired first.” However,
notwithstanding this Assurance of <HI>Grugeon</HI>'s, <HI>Fortunio</HI>
could not help being under some Apprehensions,
but forbid him from eating any Supper, that he
might eat his Breakfast the better.</P>
<P>A Balcony was raised on purpose for the Empe∣ror,
and his Consort, and Daughter, to see this
sight. <HI>Fortunio</HI> came with his little Train, and when
he saw six great Mountains of Bread, he turned pale,
which had a quite contrary effect upon <HI>Grugeon,</HI> he
being pleased therewith. The Emperor laugh'd and
jested with all his Court at the Knight and his Re∣tinue's
extravagant Undertaking, while <HI>Grugeon</HI> was
impatient for the Signal; at last it was made by
the Soundings of Trumpets and Beat of Drum, and
<HI>Grugeon</HI> fell upon one of the Heaps, and devoured
it in less than a quarter of an hour, and after that
all the rest. Never was greater Astonishment, eve∣ry
body thought it was a piece of Witchcraft, or
that their Eyes deceived them, which made them
go to the Place where the Bread was piled up to
be satisfied. <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was infinitely well plea∣sed
with this good Success, went to the Emperor,
and ask'd him if he would be pleased to be as good
as his word; to which the Emperor, inraged to
be thus over-reach'd, reply'd, that it was too much
to eat without drinking, therefore he, or some of
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
his Train, must drink all the Water in the Aqua∣ducts
and Fountains that were in that City, and
all the Wine in its Cellars. “Sir, <HI>said</HI> Fortunio,
you would put it out of my power to obey your
Commands; however, I will try, if I may flatter
myself that you will restore to my Master what
I have demanded.” “It shall be done, <HI>said the
Emperor,</HI> if you succeed in your Undertaking.”
The Knight ask'd the Emperor, if he himself
would be present; he answer'd, Yes he would, be∣cause
so rare an Action deserved his Curiosity: and
getting that instant into his Chariot, carried him to
a Fountain of seven marble Lions, which vomited
up as much Water as form'd a large River. <HI>Trin∣quet</HI>
made up to the Basin, and without so much as
ever fetching his Breath, drank it up, and left the
Fishes in the Mud and Sand. In like manner he
did by all the Aquaducts and Ponds belonging to
the City. After this Experiment, the Emperor ne∣ver
doubted but he would drink the Wine as well
as the Water; so that he, as well as the Owners,
had no inclination to try him: but <HI>Trinquet</HI> com∣plain'd
highly of that Injustice, alledging that he
had as much Right to the Wine as the Water; in∣somuch
that the Emperor, that he might not be
thought altogether covetous, consented to his De∣sires.
After that <HI>Fortunio,</HI> taking his opportunity,
put him in mind of his Promise; which, he being
unwilling to perform, put him out of humour. He
call'd his Council, and told them how much he
was concern'd, that he had promised this young
Ambassador to return what he had taken from his
Master; but withal, he thought the Conditions he
agreed on were impracticable: therefore he assem∣bled
them, to know how he might avoid what was
so much against his Interest and Inclination. The
Princess his Daughter, who was a very beautiful
Princess, having heard how much he was embaras∣sed,
came to him, and said, “Sir, as you know that
none that ever ran with me, could ever boast of
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
the Victory, if you think fit, I will contend with
him, and if he reaches first the Goal, you pro∣mise
not to elude the Word you have given.”</P>
<P>The Emperor embraced his Daughter, approved
of her Proposal, and the next day, when <HI>Fortunio</HI>
came to an Audience, said to him, “I have one
thing more to inform you of, which is, that if
you, or any of your Attendants, will run against
the Princess, I swear by all the Elements, that
if you or he gain the Race, I will give your Ma∣ster
all manner of satisfaction.” <HI>Fortunio</HI> accepted
the Challenge, and <HI>Matapa</HI> appointed the time to
be within two hours, and accordingly sent to his
Daughter, to bid her prepare herself against that
time for this Exercise, which was what she had
been used to from her Cradle. She appear'd at the
time in a long Walk of Orange-Trees, above three
Miles long, which was so carefully rolled and ma∣naged,
that there was not a Stone as big as a Pea
to be seen. She was dress'd in a light Gown of
Rose-colour'd Taffety, embroider'd in the Seams
with Gold and Silver; her Hair, which was very
fine, was tied behind her with a Ribbon, and fell
carelesly on her Shoulders; her Shoes were made
like Pumps, without Heels; she had on a Girdle
of Jewels, to shew her Shape, which was delicate:
in short, she thus appear'd like another <HI>Atalanta.</HI>
Soon after <HI>Fortunio</HI> follow'd, attended by <HI>Lightfoot</HI>
and his other Domesticks. The Emperor, and the
whole Court, were present, and seated along the
Walk, when the Ambassador proposed <HI>Lightfoot</HI> to
have the honour to run with the Princess. He was
furnish'd out of the miraculous Trunk, with a fine,
white, <HI>Holland</HI> Habit, adorn'd with <HI>Flanders</HI> Lace,
Silk Stockings of a Fire-colour, with a white Plume
of Feathers in his Cap. In this Dress he appear'd
to have a good Mien, and the Princess made no
exceptions against him; but before she set out, she
had Liquor brought, to make her more swift and
strong. Our Racer demanded the same; the Prin∣cess
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
said, it was too just a Request to be refused,
and ordered that he might have some: but as he
was not used to that Water, which was very strong,
it got into his Head, and he lay down by an O∣range-Tree,
and fell fast asleep. In the mean time
the Signal was given, and was repeated three times:
the Princess waited some time, that <HI>Lightfoot</HI> might
awake, and come to himself; but thinking it mat∣ter
of great consequence to free her Father from
his Promise, she set out with a charming Grace,
and wonderful Swiftness.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was at the other end of the Walls, and
knew nothing of what had happen'd, when he saw
the Princess running by herself, and within half a
Mile of the Goal. “O ye Powers! <HI>cry'd he, speaking
to his Horse,</HI> we are undone, I see nothing of <HI>Light∣foot.</HI>”
“Sir, <HI>said</HI> Comrade, let <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> listen, he
perhaps may inform you whereabouts he is.”
Thereupon <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> laid himself down, and tho he
was three Miles off, heard him snore; whereupon
he told them, he had no thoughts of coming, for
that he was in as sound a Sleep as if he was in his
Bed. “Alas! <HI>cry'd</HI> Fortunio <HI>again,</HI> what shall we
do?” “O! <HI>said</HI> Comrade, let the good <HI>Marksman</HI>
let fly an Arrow into the tip of his Ear, to awake
him.” At that he took his Bow immediately, and
hit him so nicely, that the Arrow went quite thro
his Ear; the Pain and Anguish of which awaken'd
him, and when he open'd his Eyes, he saw the
Princess almost at the Goal, and heard great Shou∣tings
and Acclamations of Joy. At first he was sur∣prized,
but he soon recover'd what he had lost by
sleeping; he seem'd as if he was carried by the
Wind, and in short arrived first at the Goal, with
the Arrow in his Ear, for he had not time to pull
it out. The Emperor was so much amazed at the
extraordinary things that had happen'd since the
Arrival of the Ambassador, that he believed the
Gods interested themselves in his behalf, and that
he could no longer defer the Performance of his
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
Promise. He order'd the Ambassador to come
to him, and said, “I consent that you take a∣long
with you as much of your Master's Trea∣sures
as one Man can carry; for I will never part
with any more.” The Ambassador made a low
Bow, and thank'd his Majesty, and desir'd him to
give Orders that they might be deliver'd to him.
<HI>Matapa</HI> accordingly spoke to his Treasurer, and af∣terwards
went to his Palace of Retreat, within
some few Miles of the City. <HI>Fortunio</HI> and his At∣tendants
went immediately, and demanded Entrance
to the Place where all the Treasure was kept. <HI>Strong∣back</HI>
presented himself, and by his assistance the
Ambassador carried off most of the Furniture that
was in the Emperor's Palace; as five hundred gi∣gantick
Statues of Gold, Coaches and Chariots, and
all manner of Conveniencies: and with these <HI>Strong∣back</HI>
walked as nimbly, as if he had not above a
Pound Weight on his Back.</P>
<P>When the Ministers of State saw the Palace thus
gutted, they made all the haste imaginable to ac∣quaint
the Emperor; whose Amazement was not
to be expressed, when they told him that one Man
carried all: he cry'd out, he would not allow it,
and immediately order'd his Guards to mount, and
pursue those Robbers of his Treasure. And though
<HI>Fortunio</HI> was then above ten Miles off, <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> told
him, that he heard a great Body of Horse coming
after them with full speed: And the good <HI>Marks∣man,</HI>
whose Sight was excellent, saw them, just as
they themselves came to a River-side. <HI>Fortunio</HI> said
to <HI>Trinquet,</HI> “As we have no Boats, you must drink
up this Water, that we may pass it.” Which <HI>Trin∣quet</HI>
readily perform'd; and <HI>Fortunio</HI> was for making
all possible haste to get away, when his Horse bid
him not be uneasy, but let the Enemy approach.
Soon after, they appear'd on the Banks of the Ri∣ver,
and knowing where the Fishermens Boats lay,
embark'd immediately. When the <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sterer</HI> began
to swell his Cheeks, and with a sudden Blast over∣set
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
the Boats, so that not one of that Detachment
escaped. This happy Success puffed them up with
so great Expectation, that every one began to think
of the Recompence he deserv'd, and were for making
themselves Masters of all the Riches they were car∣rying
with them; whereupon, a great Dispute arose
among them: <HI>Lightfoot</HI> said, they had got nothing
if he had not won the Race. “Well, <HI>said</HI> Fine-Ear,
if I had not heard you snore, where had we been
then?” “And who would have awaken'd you, if
I had not, <HI>added the</HI> Marksman? “Well, <HI>said</HI>
Strongback, I cannot but admire at you for your
Disputes, sure none dare pretend to lay so good a
Claim as myself, since I carried all, and, without
my Assistance, you would not have been able to
have partaken of them.” “Say rather without
mine, <HI>interrupted</HI> Trinquet, since you were in a
bad pligh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if I had not drank your Way.” “Nay,
and you were equally in the same danger, <HI>said the</HI>
Boysterer, had I not overset the Boats.” “Hither∣to,
<HI>interrupted</HI> Grugeon, I have held my peace,
but I cannot forbear representing to you, that I
open'd the Scene to all these Events; for if I had
left one Crust of Bread, all had been loft.”</P>
<P>“Friends, <HI>said</HI> Fortunio, <HI>with an Air of Command,</HI>
you have all done wonders, but we ought to
leave it to the King to recompence our Services;
for I should be sorry to be rewarded by any other
besides him. Let us all trust to his Generosity,
he sent us to fetch his Riches, and not to rob him
of them; which Thought is so shameful, that, in
my opinion, it ought to be smother'd: for my
own part, I will do so well by you, that you
shall have no reason to repine, should it be pos∣sible
for the King to neglect you.”</P>
<P>The seven gifted Men, penetrated with this Re∣monstance
of their Master, threw themselves at his
Feet, and promised that his Will should be theirs.
After all this, the lovely <HI>Fortunio</HI> found himself, as he
drew nigh to the City, agitated with a thousand
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
different Troubles; the Joy that he had done the
King such considerable Services, for whom he had
so great an Attachment, and the hope to see him
again, and be favourably receiv'd by him, flatter'd
him most agreeably. On the other hand, the fear
of enraging the Queen, and being persecuted again
by her and <HI>Florida,</HI> put him into a heavy Concern.
In short, he arrived at the Town, where the Peo∣ple,
overjoy'd to see so much Riches and Treasure,
follow'd him to the Palace with great Acclamations
of Joy. The King, who could scarcely believe such
extraordinary News, ran to acquaint the Queen with
it, who was first struck on a heap, but recovering
herself afterwards, said, “The Gods protect him,
therefore I am not surprized he should succeed
in what he undertakes.” And just as she made an
end of these Words, she saw him enter the room.
He inform'd their Majesties of what he had done,
and added, that the Treasures were left in the
Park, no other place being large enough to hold
them: and we must easily believe the King expres∣sed
a great Friendship for so loving and faithful a
Subject.</P>
<P>The Knight's Presence, and the Advantages of
his Good-fortune, open'd again and dilated those
Wounds in the Queen's Heart which were hardly
closed up; she thought him more charming than
ever, and as soon as she was at liberty to talk with
<HI>Florida,</HI> she renew'd her Complaints. “You know,
<HI>said she,</HI> what I have done to ruin him, which I
thought was the only means to forget him, yet
his unparallel'd Good-fortune brings him safe
home again: and whatever reasons I have to de∣spise
a Man so much inferior to me, and who has
repaid my Sentiments with the blackest Ingrati∣tude;
I cannot forbear loving him, and am resol∣ved
to marry him privately.” “Marry him, Ma∣dam!
<HI>cry'd</HI> Florida, it is impossible; certainly my
Ears failme.” “No, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> you know
my Intention, and must second me in it. I charge
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
you to bring <HI>Fortunio</HI> this night into my Closet; I
will myself declare to him the love I have for
him.” <HI>Florida</HI> in despair to be made the Instrument
of her Mistress's Marriage with her Lover, forgot
nothing she could say to dissuade the Queen from
seeing him. She represented that the King would
be angry should it be found out, and perhaps might
put the Knight to death, or at least would condemn
him to perpetual Imprisonment, where she would
never have the sight of him again: but all her
Eloquence was in vain; she saw the Queen began
to be in a Passion, and therefore was obliged to
obey her. She found <HI>Fortunio</HI> in the Gallery of the
Palace, ranging in order the golden Statues he
brought from the Emperor <HI>Matapa.</HI> She went to
him, and told him her Message from the Queen,
which made him tremble, and caused <HI>Florida</HI> no
small Trouble. “O Heavens! <HI>said she,</HI> how much I
pity you; why could not that Princess's Heart
escape you? Alas! I know one not half so dange∣rous,
that dares not explain itself.” The Knight
would not engage in a new Declaration; too much
was he chagrin'd already, but left her, and as he
had no desire to please the Queen, dress'd himself
but indifferently, that she might not think he strove
to set himself off; but if he could throw off his
Jewels and Imbroideries, he could not do the same
by his natural Charms. The Queen, for her part,
did what she could to heighten the Lustre of hers
by an extraordinary fine Dress, and observ'd with
pleasure that <HI>Fortunio</HI> seem'd surpriz'd. “Appearances,
<HI>said she,</HI> are sometimes so deceitful, that I was
willing to justify myself concerning what you
have thought without doubt of my Conduct, when
I engaged the King to send you to the Emperor,
it seem'd in all appearance as if I design'd to sa∣crifice
you; but depend upon it, good Knight, I
knew what would happen, and had no other
Views than your immortal Honour.” “Madam,
<HI>said he,</HI> you are too much above me to need any
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
Explanation; I enter not into the Motives that
ingaged you; it is enough for me that I obey'd
the King my Sovereign.” “You shew too much
Indifference, <HI>added she,</HI> for the declaration I make
you of my Sentiments; but tis time I convince you
of my Bounty. Come, <HI>Fortunio,</HI> receive my Hand as
the Pledge of my Faith.”</P>
<P>The poor Knight, quite Thunder-struck, was
twenty times going to acquaint the Queen with
his Sex, and durst not; but answering those To∣kens
of Friendship with great Coldness, used a
great many Arguments upon the King's Anger,
when he should know a Subject durst be so bold as
to contract, in his Court, so important a Marriage
without his Consent. After the Queen had
endeavour'd, tho in vain, to remove the Obstacles
which he seem'd to fear, she all on a sudden assu∣med
the Countenance and Voice of a Fairy, loaded
him with Menaces and Wrongs, and fought and
scratch'd him; after that, turning her Rage upon
herself, she tore off her Hair, claw'd her Face and
Neck till she was all in Gore-blood; rent her Veil
and Head-dress all in pieces, and then call'd in her
Guards, ordering them to carry the Wretch, as she
call'd him, to some Dungeon, and in the mean time
ran herself to the King to demand Justice against
that young Monster: telling him that he had had
a long time the boldness to declare his Passion, and
that in hopes that Absence and her Severities might
have cured him, she had let no opportunity slip, as
he might well observe, to have him removed out
of the way; but that he was one that nothing could
change: that he himself was a witness to what Ex∣tremities
his Passion had brought him; that she
would have him prosecuted with all rigour; and
that if he refused her that Justice, she should be
obliged to stand upon her own Guard for the future.</P>
<P>The manner in which she spoke, amazed the King;
he knew her to be a Woman of a most violent Tem∣per,
and that withal she had a great Power, and
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
could raise great Distractions in the Kingdom. <HI>For∣tunio</HI>'s
Boldness deserved an exemplary Punishment;
what was pass'd was publickly known to the whole
World, and it was his duty to revenge his Sister's
Affront: but alas! on whom was his Fury to light?
On a Knight who had exposed his Life to the grea∣test
Dangers, to whom he owed his Quiet and all
his Treasures, and one besides for whom he had a
particular value and love. He would have almost
lost his own Life to save this dear Favourite. He
represented to the Queen the Services he had done
both him and the State, his Youth, and whatever
might induce her to forgive him; but she would
give no ear to what he said, but demanded his Life.
The King seeing he could not possibly avoid his be∣ing
try'd, appointed Judges that he thought to be
the most mild and susceptible of Tenderness, who
might put the most favourable construction upon the
Letter of the Law: but he was mistaken in his
conjectures; the Judges were for establishing their
Reputation at this poor unhappy Knight's expence;
and as it was an A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>air that would make a great
noise in the World, they arm'd themselves with the
utmost rigour, and condemned <HI>Fortunio</HI> without hear∣ing
him plead for himself. His Sentence was to re∣ceive
three Stabs in the Heart, as the principal
part concern'd.</P>
<P>The King dreaded this Sentence as much as if it
was to have been pronounced against himself; he
banish'd all the Judges, but could not save his belo∣ved
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> while the Queen triumph'd in the
Punishment he was to suffer. The King made use
of fresh Arguments, which only exasperated her
the more. To be short, the day appointed for this
horrid Execution came: the Knight was brought
out of the Prison where he had been kept from the
Speech of all Persons, not knowing the Crime he
was accused of, but imagining that it was some
new Persecution, which his Indifference for the
Queen had brought upon him; yet what troubled
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
him the most was, he thought the King seconded
that Princess in what she did. In the mean time
<HI>Florida,</HI> inconsolable for the condition to which her
Lover was reduced, took a resolution of the utmost
Violence, which was to poison both the Queen and
herself if <HI>Fortunio</HI> was to suffer death so unjustly.
As soon as she knew the Sentence, Despair possess'd
her Soul, and she thought of nothing but the exe∣cution
of her designs; but it happen'd that the Poi∣son
was not prepared so strong as she intended it▪
insomuch, that tho she had given it the Queen,
she felt not presently the effects of it, but had the
lovely Knight brought to the great Space before the
Palace, that she might have the satisfaction of see∣ing
him die. When the Executioners had taken
him out of the Dungeon where he lay, and brought
him like a tender Lamb going to the slaughter;
the first Object that his eyes beheld when he came
upon the Scaffold, was the Queen, who thought she
could not be too nigh, being desirous to have his
Blood spurt on her. But, alas! the poor King shut
himself up in his Closet, that he might with more
freedom bewail the Fate of his dear Favourite.</P>
<P>But when they had bound <HI>Fortunio,</HI> and came to
open his Breast; how great was the surprize of
that numerous Assembly, when they saw the white
Breasts of a lovely Maid, and knew that she was
an innocent Damsel unjustly accused! The Queen
was in so great a confusion, that the Poison began
to work, and threw her into strong Convulsions,
out of which she never recovered but to express
her bitter regret. In the mean time the People,
who loved <HI>Fortunio,</HI> set her at liberty; and the News
was presently carried to the King, who had aban∣don'd
himself to Melancholy. At that instant
Joy took place; he ran to the Palace, and was
charm'd to see the new Metamorphosis of his dear
<HI>Fortunio:</HI> however, the last Sighs and Groans of the
Queen suspended in some measure his Transports;
but when he came to reflect upon her Malice, he
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
was not so sorry. He resolved to marry this his
young Heroine, to repay with a Crown his great
Obligations to her; and declared his Intentions to
her, which we may easily believe compleated the
height of her Desires, which were so much to be a
Queen, as to enjoy the Person of a Prince for
whom she had always entertain'd a most tender
Affection. The day of celebrating the Marriage
was fixed; our young Knight laid aside her Man's
Habit, and assum'd that of her own Sex, in which
she appear'd a thousand times more beautiful. She
consulted her Horse what Adventures should hap∣pen
to her for the future; but as he could promise
none more agreeable, she in gratitude for the
great Services he had done her, built him a Stable
paved with Ebony and Ivory, and instead of being
litter'd with Straw, he lay always on Mats of Sat∣tin:
and for her seven Attendants, they were all
rewarded according to their Services.</P>
<P>After all this was done, News was brought to
our young Queen that <HI>Comrade</HI> was not to be found,
which was no less trouble to the King who adored
her, than to herself: she made enquiry for three
days all to no purpose; and on the fourth she arose
with the Morning, and went into the Garden, which
she crost, and so into a thick Wood, and thence
into a large Meadow, calling out, “<HI>Comrade,</HI> my
dear <HI>Comrade</HI> were art thou? What do you forsake
me! I have occasion for thy Advice.” And as she
was talking after this manner, she saw all on a sud∣den
another Sun arising in the West, which made
her stand to admire that Prodigy; but her Amaze∣ment
still increased to see it approach her nigher,
and especially when she knew her Horse again co∣ver'd
with Jewels, and prancing before a Chario<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Pearls and Topazzes, drawn by four and twenty
Sheep that were cover'd with gold Fringe instead
of Wool: their Harness was crimson Sattin buckled
on with Emeralds, their Horns were adorn'd with
Carbuncles. The new Queen knew the Fairy her
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
Protectress in the Chariot, and her Father and two
Sisters, who cry'd out, clapping their hands, and
making Professions of Friendship, that they were
come to her Wedding. Their Sister, for her part,
thought she should have expired with Joy at seeing
them again; she neither knew what she said or
did: but at last recovering herself, she got into the
Chariot, and return'd with this pompous Equipage
to the Palace; where every thing was prepar'd
for celebrating the most magnificent Feast that ever
was made in that Kingdom Thus the enamour'd
King united himself to his fair Deliverer, and af∣forded
us this charming Adventure, which has been
handed down from one Age to another.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAndinardiere</HI> having listned with great Atten∣tion
to the Story of <HI>Fortunio,</HI> and as he was ve∣ry
susceptible of Impressions, the Prior observing
that he cry'd heartily, said, “What is the matter
with you? you seem very much concern'd.” “Alas!
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> who can be otherwise? sure his Heart
must be harder than the Flints that hurt my Head:
who can resist so just a Cause of Affliction?” “Had
that young female Warriour closed the Scene
with her Death, <HI>answer'd the Prior,</HI> it would have
excited my Sorrow, but you grieve unseasonably.”
“Indeed, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>wiping his Eyes,</HI> her
Marriage makes her too happy for us not to share
in her Joy; therefore let us be merry, for I have
some reason to be so, since the generous Present
you have made me of this admirable Story: the
Obligation is so great, that I shall always be ready
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
to sacrifice my Life for you.” “O, you are too
full of Acknowledgment, <HI>answer'd the Prior,</HI> I de∣sire
no greater Recompence, than the Pleasure
of seeing you shine among the most ingenious In∣ventors
of Stories, like the Sun at noon-day:
I will go and tell the charming <HI>Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Marthonida</HI> how much you excel them in this kind
of Writing, and that if they will come and see
you in your Chamber in the afternoon, you
will convince them thereof.” “Oh! you ravish
me, <HI>said he, clasping him in his Arms,</HI> I am per∣suaded
that this Work will immortalize me; I can∣not
but think of the secret Rage of those two Fair∣ones,
when they come to know that I have a
thousand times more Wit than themselves.” “They
must bear it with Patience, <HI>added the Prior;</HI> but
adieu, I have read enough to get me a Stomach
to my Breakfast.” “And I have heard so much,
<HI>reply'd the Cit,</HI> that my Head stands in need of a lit∣tle
Repose.”</P>
<P>The Prior went and told the two young Ladies,
that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> had finish'd an excellent Work,
and invited them to come and hear it. “Indeed,
<HI>said</HI> Marthonida, he has so much Wit in his Face,
that at first sight one may be assur'd he is capable
of doing whatever he pleases.” “'Tis a great and
singular Happiness, <HI>added</HI> Virginia, for a Man like
him, who has acted so long in Blood and Slaughter,
who has been in the greatest Battels, fought in his
time in <HI>Europe,</HI> to preserve as much Delicacy as
the learned and studious Gentlemen, that hardly
ever stir out of their Closets.” The Prior had
much ado to forbear laughing, to hear that they
took <HI>Dandi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere</HI> for a Soldier, and one who was
both fear'd and admir'd in the Army, and would
not by any means undeceive them, being very desi∣rous
to conclude a Match between him and one of
those young Girls. When he left them, away he
hurried to the Viscount <HI>de Berginville,</HI> to tell him,
that before Night, Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> and the
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
Cit would be at daggers-drawing about the Story
of <HI>Fortunio.</HI> “Is it possible, <HI>cry'd the Viscount,</HI> that
you should go to set them at variance, just at the
very time we are thinking seriously of uniting
them for ever.” “I own I am in the wrong, <HI>said
the Prior,</HI> but I thought it would be so pleasant,
to hear them on both sides affirm, that they
composed that Work, quarrel about it, and pro∣duce
their Witnesses, that I was not Master e∣nough
over myself to forbear.” “I believe, <HI>re∣ply'd
the other,</HI> it would create such an Aversion,
instead of Tenderness, that they would bear it
with them to their Graves.” “Alas! <HI>said the Prior,</HI>
what shall we do? he has the Story under his Pil∣low,
and one may as well take away his Life as
it.” I have thought on a Way how to get it,
“<HI>reply'd the Viscount;</HI> and that is, for you to keep
him in discourse while I steel it.” “That is the
way to make him hang himself, <HI>cry'd the Prior,</HI> for
he builds on nothing more than the Pleasure or
persuading his Mistress he has Wit: What a vexa∣tion
will he be in, to have invited so much Com∣pany
to hear it, and to find nothing to say to
them? The only Remedy then that I know of,
<HI>answer'd the Viscount,</HI> is for me to send home to
my Wife for one which an Acquaintance sent
her; for in short, he has not lent so great atten∣tion
to the Subject, but he may be deceiv'd, since
it treats of Fairies.” “I give my consent, <HI>said the
Prior,</HI> provided you manage the matter right, o∣therwise
you are a dead Man.” Hereupon the
Viscount sent away his Servant, who, as it was no
great way off, return'd soon enough for his Master to
make the projected Exchange.</P>
<P>The Prior, full of Impatience, ran into the young
Ladies Chamber, and said to them, “I always
took Mr. <HI>de la Dandinardiere</HI> to be as brave as <HI>Alexander</HI>
and <HI>Caesar,</HI> but did not know that he was an uni∣versal
Wit before: He has just now finish'd a
Story that will go nigh to enrage all that have any
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
Genius that way: and if he makes so good a Be∣ginning,
no body knows what he may arrive to.”
And while he said these Words, he roll'd his Eyes,
and made a thousand Grimaces. <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mar∣thonida</HI>
observ'd a strict Silence, which was owing
to their Astonishment at the News; and the Prior
resuming the Discourse, said, Yes, twenty times to∣gether,
in answer to their Thoughts, Yes he will
excel yet more and more; yes, yes, he is a Prodigy
and Miracle of Nature. <HI>Virginia</HI> was so taken with
what the Prior said, that she cry'd out, “Ah! Sir,
you praise so well, that I look upon you to be the
greatest Panegyrist of all Men: I would say some∣thing
myself of Mr. <HI>Dandinardiere.</HI>” “But Sister,
<HI>said</HI> Marthonida, <HI>interrupting her</HI> let us rather have
the pleasure of hearing this admirable Work as
soon as possible.” At that the Prior told them, he
would go in their Names, and make that Request,
and so took his leave. As soon as he was gone, they
pleased themselves with talking of the Satisfaction
they should have, but forgot not to dress themselves
better than ordinary: To this end they each put
on a riding Habit they had newly made up of green
Mohair a Hat of black Velvet, which, through
Use was turn'd of a russet Colour, set full of Pea∣cocks
Feathers, with Scarfs of old tinsel Lace,
which hung down from their Shoulders like Ban∣deleers;
at the end of which they had ty'd a
Horn, though they could not blow it: and, in
short, made a great show of Magnificence in a
Country Village.</P>
<P>I know not what fantastical Planet ruled that
day, in respect of the Dress of these Heroines and
our Hero; who, in the hopes of seeing them, was
consulting with himself what would set him off the
best he could: for to appear before them with his
Head bound up, he could not bear the Thoughts of
it; and to pull off his Bandages, was ten times
worse. At last he resolv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to wrap his Waistcoat,
which was yellow, about his Head; and according∣ly,
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
made thereof a kind of Turban with the Sleeves
hanging down on each side: to this he added a
Gorget of Steel half eaten up with Rust, a Pair of
Gauntlets drawn on his Hands, and an Heap of
Cushions to support him. To see him in this ridi∣culous
Dress, a Man must be more austere than the
greatest Cynick to forbear laughing. But all this
had the contrary effect on <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida,</HI>
since it made them admire him the more. As soon
as Dinner was over, and the Cloth taken away, the
Prior engag'd Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> to go to see the
illustrious wounded Cit, who had promis'd them
the reading of a Story. The Thoughts of hearing
a Work of Wit, flatter'd her so agreeably, that she
rose up presently, and with a grave and solemn Air
went into the dying Man's Chamber, follow'd by
her two Daughters, partly dress'd like <HI>Amazons,</HI>
and partly like Country Girls; yet notwithstanding
this Fantasticalness, the Gentlemen were so well
bred, as to give them their hands. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
was so transported with Joy to see them, that he
knew not what to do and was twenty times going
to jump out of his Bed to make some Bows and
Scrapes, as an Acknowledgement of the Favour they
did him. After every body was seated, he said to
them in a formal Speech, “I beg pardon, Ladies,
for presuming to invite you hither, since you per∣haps
may expect to hear the Song of a Nightin∣gale;
and I can assure you, you will find it but
a Screech-Owl's.” “We are under no Apprehen∣sions
of being Screech-owl'd, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> de St
Thomas, <HI>who pretended to a great Choice and Variety of
Words,</HI> since we know you to have too great a
share of the Nightingale's Warblings.” “I have as
great an Inclination to commend you as my Mo∣ther,
<HI>said</HI> Virginia, and can do it perhaps in Terms
no less harsh to the Ears? but the great Desire
I have to hear your Story, imposes a Silence on
me.” “Ah! Madam, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, you will,
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
if I dont take care, undo me with Praises, which
proceeding from those ruby Lips, almost stifle me.”
“Don't hear them then, <HI>added</HI> Marthonida; a Merit
so shining as yours, is always expos'd to rude As∣saults.”
“Charming Ladies, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> you heap
so many Favours upon me, that my Silence is the
only means left me of Acknowledgment: How∣ever,
Monsieur the Prior <HI>de Richecour</HI> shall read
my Work, which I composed in what you may
call post-haste; which makes me cursedly ashamed.”
“I have, <HI>said Madam</HI> de St. Thomas, <HI>interrupting him,</HI>
been admiring for above this Hour, the noble and
easy Expressions you make use of, and must own,
that you Courtiers have something in you that
surpasses the rest of Mankind.” “O Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, there are some Courts—but
that I was brought up in, is so nice and deli∣care,
that they will not there allow of the
least Obscenity: All Barbarians are there ba∣nish'd;
no Man but a Purist can live there.” The
Mother and the two Daughters could have heard the
sick Man a whole day, without ever interrupting him,
so much were they taken with the great Words he
used; when all on a sudden, they were disturbed by a
great Noise made in the Yard, and upon looking
out of the Window, saw <HI>Alain</HI> with a Cart and
three Asses loaded with his Master's Study, and he
fighting with the Carter, whom he accused of steal∣ing
a Musick-Book; which piece of Injustice of the
Major-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omo's had so inraged the Country I ellow,
that to Fifty-Cuffs they went, and <HI>Alain</HI> got well
lugg'd by the Hair and Ears, and thresh'd for his
pains.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> at this News jumps out of Bed,
wrapt in one of the Sheets, and in that Equipage
ran to the Window, overjoy'd to see his faithful
<HI>Alain</HI> a Man of so much Prowess; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reflecting
presently on the Irregularity of his Dishabille, he
address'd himself to the Ladies to make an Excuse:
“I own, <HI>said he,</HI> my Courage is so troublesome to
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
me, and overpowers me so much, that I cannot
hear the least Noise of fighting without being
moved: I have fought a hundred times, purely out
of the pleasure I take in hearing the Swords
clash.” Thus he kept talking, with the Sheet
half on and half off, his Turban awry, and on his
bare Feet; for being seen in which Posture, he was
in no great pain: when Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> de∣sired
him to get into Bed again, and sent to part
<HI>Alain,</HI> who had already began to think of an ho∣nourable
Retreat, having receiv'd six Blows for e∣very
one he ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and who indeed loved his own
Skin better than all his Master's Books; “Keep the
Book, <HI>said he to his Antagon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st,</HI> and let me alone.”
“No, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> you have robb'd me of my
Honour; restore it me, or you are a dead Man.”
Just as he had spoke these Words, the Succours
Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> sent, came and deliver'd <HI>Alain</HI>
out of the inraged Carter's hands. But the Dispute
began again with more Heat when he was to be
paid; for <HI>Alain</HI> was for abating him Tenpence, as
a Recompence for his bloody Nose and swell'd Eyes,
However, at last all was pacify'd, and the Cart and
Asses went away, and the Books were left spread
upon the Grass; where they were most terribly
wet, by a sudden Shower that fell, before they
could be got into the House. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Vexa∣tion
made all those who knew how ignorant he
was, laugh heartily. “Alas! <HI>said he,</HI> my <HI>Greek</HI> Books,
those dear Delights, when alone: Alas! my <HI>He∣brew</HI>
Books, which I have began to translate
with so much pains. Alas! my <HI>Latin</HI> Poets and
my Algebra. Alas! had you perish'd in the Sea,
or in the midst of a Town on fire, or by Lightning,
I should not have been so much concern'd; but
to be destroy'd by an ugly Shower of Rain in
the midst of a Yard, makes me inconsolable.”
<HI>Virginia</HI> touch'd with the just Grief of the learned
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> conjur'd him to forbear making
those sad Complaints, unless he so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght her Death;
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
promising withal, that all the Family should be
employ'd to dry them, and flattering him that
there would be enough to entertain him agreeably.
<HI>Marthonida</HI> added fresh Arguments to those of her
Sister; so that he thought he should be very much
in the wrong, if he was not comforted, since the
most amiable Persons in the World concern'd them∣selves
therein. Then the Prior demanding Audience
of the Company, began to read the following
Story.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of the Pidgeon and the Dove.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was formerly a King and Queen, who
lived in that strict Union and Love, that they
were an Example to all the Families in their own
Kingdom, which was the Kingdom of <HI>Desarts;</HI> where
the Subjects lived together in that Harmony, that they
were the Surprize of their Neighbours. The Queen
had had several Children, but could rear up but one;
which was a Daughter of such incomparable Beauty,
that if any thing could comfort her for the loss of her
other Children, it was the Charms that appear'd in
this. The King and Queen educated her as their
only Hope; but the Felicity of this small Family
lasted not long. The King being one day an hunt∣ing
upon a fiery starting Horse, and some People
being a shooting, the Horse was so frighted at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire and Noise of a Gun, that he ran away with
the King, and fell with him down a great Preci∣pice▪
where he died immediately. This dismal
News reduced the Queen to the utmost extremity;
she was too sensible of Grief to moderate or resist
it, and thought of nothing but settling her Affairs,
that she might die with some sort of Quiet; and
having a Friend, who was called, <HI>The Sovereig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
Fairy,</HI> because of her Authority over all Kingdoms,
and her great Power, she writ a Letter to herwith
a dying hand, desiring her to come, that she might
expire in her Arms, and to make haste if she would
find her alive, because she had something of conse∣quence
to say to her.</P>
<P>Though the Fairy had at that time matters of
great Concern upon her hands, she left them all
unfinished, and mounting upon her fiery Camel, that
went swifter than the Sun, came to the Queen,
who waited for her with the utmost impatience:
First, she acquainted her with several things rela∣ting
to the Government of the Kingdom, desiring
her to accept of it, and withal to take care of the
little Princess <HI>Constantia.</HI> And then said, “If any
thing can make me easy, in leaving an Orphan of
so tender an Age behind me, 'tis the Hope you
give me of the same Marks of Friendship towards
her, as you have always shewn me, and that she
will find in you a Mother, that can make her
happier, and render her more perfect; and that
you will make choice of an Husband so amiable,
that she may never love any other.” “Great
Queen, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> you desire all that can be
wish'd for, and I will forget nothing to serve
your Daughter; but I have cast her Nativity, and
it seems Fate is angry with Nature for having
exhausted all her Treasures in her Birth, and up∣on
that account is resolved to make her suffer:
and your Majesty must know, that it sometimes
pronounces some Sentences that are not to be
avoided.” “However, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> soften her
Misfortunes, and neglect nothing to prevent them;
by attention we often may prevent great Evils.”
The Sovereign Fairy promised what she desired,
and the Queen having embraced her dear <HI>Constantia</HI>
with all the Tenderness of a loving Mother, died
in great Tranquillity.</P>
<P>The Fairy, who read with great ease whatever
was foretold by the Stars, saw plainly, that the
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Princess was threaten'd with the fatal Love of a
Giant, whose Dominions lay nigh to the Kingdom
of <HI>Desarts;</HI> therefore she thought the best way to
avoid him, was to remove her Charge to a part the
farthest off from that Giant, where they might
be in no likelihood of his disturbing their Repose.
Whereupon, as soon as she had made choice of
some Ministers she durst confide in, to govern in her
Absence, and had enacted some Laws as judiciously
contrived for the Benefit of the Subject, as any
that were made by the Sages of <HI>Grecce,</HI> she went
one night into <HI>Constantia</HI>'s Chamber, and, without
waking her, took her in her Arms, and carried her
on her fiery Camel into a fertile Country, where she
might live free from Ambition and Trouble; it being
a true Representation of the Valley of <HI>Temp,</HI> where
Shepherds and Shepherdesses lived in little Huts of
their own building. The Fairy knowing, that if
the Princess lived to sixteen years of Age, with∣out
seeing the Giant, that she might return in tri∣umph
back to her own Dominions, took all the
care imaginable to conceal her from the eyes of all
the World; and that she might not appear so beauti∣ful,
dressed her like a Shepherdess: with her Coifs,
and Hat hanging over her Eyes; but that charming
Princess, like the Sun breaking out from a dark
Cloud, could not be so disguised, but that some of
her Charms must appear; and notwithstanding all
the Fairy's Care, <HI>Constantia</HI> was every where men∣tioned
as the chief Work of the Gods, and the
Ravisher of all Hearts. Besides, her Beauty was not
the only thing for which she was admired; the
Fairy had endowed her with a delicate Voice, and
the Knowledge of all Instruments, that she might
be said even to excel <HI>Apoll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the Muses. In this
Solitude she lived without the least repining, for
the Fairy had acquainted her with the Reasons of
bringing her up in so obscure a manner; which, as
she had a great share of Wit and good Sense, she
relished extraordinary well: In short, she was the
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
Admiration of the Fairy for her Docility and Apt∣ness
of Apprehension. But as her Presence, at that
time, was absolutely necessary in the Kingdom of
<HI>Desarts,</HI> since the Ministers she had appointed acted
not according to their Instructions, she was obliged
to leave <HI>Constantia,</HI> enjoining her not to stir out till
she returned.</P>
<P>The Princess had a Favourite Ram, that she had
bred up from a Lamb, and which she called <HI>Ruson,</HI>
with which she used to divert herself, dressing
it up with Garlands of Flowers, and Bunches
of Ribbons. It knew her Voice, and would do
whatever she bid it, and used to skip about her
Chamber, and play with her for hours together.
Wherever she went, it would go along with her,
would eat nought but what she gave it, and would
sooner perish with Thirst than drink out of any
thing but the Palms of her Hands; it would shut a
Door, beat Time when the Princess sung, and bleat
by way of Cadence: In short, <HI>Ruson</HI> was amiable,
and was loved by <HI>Constantia,</HI> who was continually
talking and making much of him. Notwithstand∣ing
all this, <HI>Ruson</HI> was more taken with an Ewe of
the Flock than his Princess, and a poor sorry Ewe
was more in <HI>Ruson</HI>'s Eyes than the Queen of Love.
<HI>Constantia</HI> often reproached him with his Wanton∣ness:
“Little Libertine, <HI>said she,</HI> cannot you stay
with me? thou art so dear to me, that for thee a∣lone
I neglect my whole Flock, and yet thou wilt
not forsake that scabby Ewe to please me.” After
that, she tied him to the Wall with a Chain of
Flowers, whereat he seemed very much vexed, and
kept pulling and tearing till he broke it. “Alas,
<HI>said</HI> Constantia <HI>in a Passion,</HI> the Fairy has often
told me, that Men are as wilful as thee, that they
cannot endure the least Confinement, and that they
are the most refractory Creatures under the Hea∣vens;
therefore since thou wilt be like them,
naughty <HI>Ruson,</HI> go to thy nasty Ewe, and if the
Wolf should catch thee, thou must take it for thy
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
pains, since it will not be perhaps in my power to
save thee.”</P>
<P>The amorous Sheep, on whom <HI>Constantia</HI>'s Advice
could not prevail, being one day with his dear
Ewe, nigh the little House where the Princess was
set working all alone, she heard him bleat out so
loud and pitifully, that she no longer disputed but
some ill Accident had befel him; and being very
much concerned for him, ran to the door, from
whence she saw her poor <HI>Ruson</HI> carried away by a
Wolf: and not thinking of the Charge the Fairy
had given her, ran after, crying out a Wolf, a
Wolf; and still pursued him, sometimes throwing
her Crook, and sometimes Stones at him, but all
could not make him quit his Prey: when, alas!
passing by a Wood, there came out a terrible
Giant. The Princess, at the sight of this frightful
<HI>Colossus,</HI> lifted up her Eyes to Heaven to beg
assistance, and almost wish'd the Earth would open
and swallow her, but all in vain; she deserved
to be punish'd for not believing and observing what
the sovereign Fairy told her. The Giant spread
wide his Arms to hinder her passing by; and tho
he was both savage and furious, nevertheless he
was sensible of her Charms. “What Goddess art
thou? <HI>said he in a Voice loud as Thunder,</HI> think not
to deceive me, for thou art not mortal; therefore
tell me thy Name, or whether thou be the Wife
or Daughter of <HI>Jove?</HI> I have a long time sought
after a Goddess to marry her, and now happily
met with one.” At these words the Princess re∣main'd
mute, and he finding that she returned no
answer to his Gallantries, said, “For a Divinity
thou hast the least Wit I ever met with, there∣fore
I shall put thee in my Bag.” And without any
more ado open'd a great Sack and put her in.
The first thing she perceiv'd was the Wolf and the
Ram, which the Giant had taken as he was hunt∣ing.
“Alas! <HI>said the Princess to the Sheep, kissing it,</HI>
thou must die with me, my dear <HI>Ruson,</HI> but that's
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
but a small Comfort; would it not have been
much better for us to have staid at home?” This
melancholy Reflection made her cry most bitter∣ly;
she sigh'd and sobb'd, <HI>Ruson</HI> bleated, and the
Wolf howl'd, which awaken'd a Dog, a Cock, a
Parrot, and a Cat, that were fast asleep, and they
all together made such a noise, that the Giant tired
therewith, thought once to kill them: but at last
contented himself with only tying them up in the
Sack, and hanging it upon a Tree while he went
to fight a Duel with another Giant.</P>
<P>The Princess never disputed but that she was a
great way from home, tho she had not been long
in the Sack, for the Giant's moderate rate of walk∣ing
was faster than the swiftest Horse could gallop;
however she took out her Scissars, and ripp'd up, the
Sack, and let out her <HI>Ruson,</HI> the Cock, the Cat,
and Parrot; and after them got out herself, leaving
the Wolf behind. The Night was very dark,
and the Princess a Stranger to the place where she
was, and knew not which way to go, being in the
midst of a large Forest, and not a Star appear'd
in the Heavens that might afford her the least light,
and she always in fear of meeting the Giant: not∣withstanding
all this, she went forwards, and had fell
a thousand times, but that the Animals she had set at
liberty, out of gratitude stay'd with her, and were
very serviceable to her in her Journey. The Cat's
glaring Eyes served for a Flambeau, the Dog as a
Sentinel to give notice by his barking, the Cock
by his crowing to frighten the Lions, and the Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot
by his talking secured her against Thieves, by
making them believe there were twenty People;
and the Ram by going just before, pick'd out her
way that she might not stumble. <HI>Constantia</HI> kept
walking on, at a venture, recommending herself
to the protection of her good Friend the Fairy, tho
at the same time she reproach'd herself for not
having followed her Orders. Sometimes she fea∣red
she was forsaken, and wish'd that her Good∣fortune
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
fortune would conduct her to the House where
she had been brought up so privately; but as
she was intirely ignorant of the way, she durst
not flatter herself with so great an Happiness.
At Day-break she found herself by the side of a
River, that water'd a most agreeable Meadow, and
looking about, saw neither Dog, Cat, Cock, or
Parrot, but only <HI>Ruson,</HI> that kept her company:
“Alas! <HI>said she,</HI> where am I? I am a perfect Stran∣ger
to this sweet Abode; what will become of
me? Who will take care of me? How much
hast thou cost me, my dear Favourite? <HI>said she to</HI>
Ruson: Had I not run after thee, I had been still
with the <HI>Sovereign-Fairy,</HI> and had been in no fear
of the Giant, or any unlucky Adventure.” <HI>Ruson</HI>
trembling, seem'd to acknowledge his Fault; and
in short, the Princess fatigued and weary, left off
chiding, and sat herself down on the Banks, where
the Shade of some Trees securing her from the
Heat of the Sun, invited her to lie down to take
a short Sleep, while <HI>Ruson,</HI> who served for her
Guard, walked around her. She had not been long
in a sound Sleep, before <HI>Ruson</HI> bleated so loud, that
he awaken'd her; but then how great was her
Astonishment, to observe at twenty Paces off a
young Man behind some Bushes; the Beauty of his
Shape and Face, the Nobleness of his Air, and the
Magnificence of his Dress, equally surprized the
Princess, that she started up all on a sudden, with
a Resolution to be gone: but what secret Charm
detain'd her, I know not. She look'd upon the
Stranger with as much Concern, as if he had been
the Giant; but her Apprehensions proceeded from
different Causes: their Looks and Actions disco∣ver'd
too well the Sentiments they entertain'd of
each other, and they perhaps might have remain'd
so some time before they had spoke, had not the
Prince heard the Sounding of the Horn, and the
Dogs approaching them. Perceiving she was sur∣prized,
at last he said, “Fear nothing, fair Shep∣herdess,
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
you are safe here, would to Heaven all
that see you were so too.” “Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> I am a
poor Orphan, whose only Employ is being a Shep∣herdess,
therefore I implore your Protection; pro∣cure
me but a Flock, none shall exceed me in
Care.” “Happy must the Sheep be, <HI>said he,</HI> that
you lead! But in short, lovely Shepherdess, if
you desire it, I'll speak to the Queen my Mother,
and shall take a pleasure from this day to offer
you my Services.” “Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Constantia,
I ask pardon for the liberty I have taken; I
should not have been so bold, had I known your
Rank.”</P>
<P>The Prince heard her with the utmost Astonish∣ment,
to find her Wit and Politeness answerable to
the Excellence of her Beauty, all which was no
ways agreeable with the Plainness of her Dress;
and thereupon endeavour'd to dissuade her from
being a Shepherdess. “Consider, <HI>said he,</HI> you will
be exposed in Woods and Fields to many Dangers,
where you have no other Company but your
harmless Sheep; besides, the Delicacies I have
observed in you will not admit of that Solitude
you seem to desire. Who can be so ignorant as
to think, that when the Fame of your Charms is
spread abroad, you can avoid thousands of impor∣tunate
Lovers? I myself, <HI>Adorable Shepherdess,</HI> will
quit the Court to follow you; and why may not
others do the like?” “Forbear, Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> to
flatter me with Praises, of which I am no ways
deserving; I was born in a Cottage, and have al∣ways
led a Country Life, and hope you will per∣mit
me to look after the Queen's Flock, if she
vouchsafe me that Charge, in all Tranquillity:
But yet I have one Favour more to request, and
that is, that I may be put under some more ex∣perienced
Shepherdess, whom I shall endeavour
never to displease.” The Prince could not return
any Answer to these Words, because his Attendants
appear'd on a Hill at some small distance, but said
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
to her in great haste, “I must leave you, charming
Fair; I cannot bear the thoughts that so many
should partake of the Happiness of seeing you:
go to the end of this Meadow, there is a House
where you will be entertain'd, if you tell them
I sent you.” Hereupon <HI>Constantia,</HI> who was loth
to be exposed to so much Company, ran to the
Place where <HI>Constantio</HI> (which was the Prince's
Name) directed her, follow'd all the while by that
Prince's Eyes, who ferch'd many tender Sighs;
then remounting his Horse, he made towards his
Company, and with them return'd to Court, with∣out
pursuing their Sport any longer.</P>
<P>When he came to see the Queen, he found her
very much enraged against an old Shepherdess, who
had given up a very bad account of her Lambs;
whereupon she had order'd her never to see her
more. <HI>Constantio,</HI> favour'd with this opportunity,
told her he had met with a young Damsel that
seem'd careful, and who was very desirous to serve
her. The Queen approved of what her Son told her,
and accepted of the Shepherdess without seeing
her, bidding the Prince give Orders for her to be
conducted to those Pastures that belonged to the
Crown. He was overjoy'd that she was dispensed
with from coming to Court, for the Violence of his
Passion had created a Jealousy of being rival'd, tho
there were none that could dispute with him either
in Rank or Merit; but indeed he was not so ap∣prehensive
of the great Lords, as of more inferior
Persons, believing she might have more Inclination
for a plain Shepherd, than for a Prince so nigh to
the Throne. Hard it is to relate the many Reflec∣tions
with which this was follow'd, how he re∣proach'd
his Heart, that had never loved before,
nor thought any Person worthy of it, for submit∣ting
to a young Damsel of an obscure Birth; and
since that he could not own his Passion without a
Blush, he resolved to combat it, and persuaded him∣self
that Absence was the only Remedy, particular∣ly
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
in a new-born Love. He avoided the sight of
his Shepherdess as much as possible, and followed
his Diversion of Hunting and other Sports; and
whenever he saw any Sheep, turn'd his Head a∣way,
as if they were so many Vipers, insomuch
that in a little time he was insensible of the Wound
he had received: when one day, it being the hot∣test
of the Dog-days, fatigued with severe Hunting,
and being alone by the River's side, he retired un∣der
some Willows and Osiers, that by the uniting
of their Branches form'd a pleasant Shade, which
invited him to sleep; when all on a sudden he was
awaken'd by an heavenly Voice, and agreeably sur∣prized
to hear these words:</P>
<LG>
<L>Why, alas! have I then vow'd</L>
<L>To live all free from Love,</L>
<L>Since it is the God's Decree,</L>
<L>That he will me perjur'd prove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How from such a killing Wound</L>
<L>Shall I free each tender Part,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Constantio</HI> is become</L>
<L>Master of my easy Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>T'other day I saw him walk</L>
<L>To this solitary Glade,</L>
<L>Wearied with the pleasing Toil,</L>
<L>That invites Men to its Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nothing so charming had I seen</L>
<L>To rob me of my Rest;</L>
<L>'Twas then Love drew his Bow,</L>
<L>And aim'd it at my Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Dart pierced in too deep,</L>
<L>So large a Wound it made;</L>
<L>My Passion burns up to a Flame,</L>
<L>No Cure is to be had.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>
His Curiosity, at the hearing of his Name men∣tion'd,
prevailing over the Pleasure of listening to
the fine Singing, he rose up, and went to a little
Eminence, surrounded with Trees, to look about,
he was no sooner at the top, but perceived the fair
<HI>Constantia</HI> at the foot thereof, sitting by the side of
a Brook, the precipitant Fall whereof seem'd, by
the agreeable Noise it made, to agree with her
Voice. Her faithful Sheep lay on the Grass by her
side, while she frequently patted him with her
Crook, and he, in acknowledgment, looking her
in the face, kissed her hand. “Alas! <HI>said the Prince
to himself,</HI> how happy wouldst thou be, if thou
knewst but the Value of those Caresses? This Shep∣herdess
is now more beautiful than the first time
I saw her! O Love! what is it thou requirest of
me! Ought I to love, or am I rather able to re∣sist?
I have carefully avoided her, being too sen∣sible
of the Danger of seeing her; witness, ye
Gods, the Impressions those first Moments made
on me. My Reason I employ'd to my assistance,
I flew from the lovely Object; but alas! have
found it again: and too sure, the <HI>Constantio</HI> she
spoke of, is some happy Shepherd.”</P>
<P>While he was arguing with himself after this
manner, the Shepherdess arose to gather up her
Flock, to drive them to another part of the Mead,
where she had left her Companions. The Prince,
fearing to lose this opportunity of speaking to her,
made all imaginable haste to get to her: “Charm∣ing
Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> give me leave to ask you,
if the small service I did you is any ways pleasing
to you?” <HI>Constantia,</HI> at the sight of the Prince,
blush'd, and her Complexion was animated with
the most lively Colours: “Sir, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> I should
have taken care to have return'd you my most
humble Acknowledgments, if they had been con∣venient
from so poor a Girl as me to so great a
Prince; but if I have been failing therein, Hea∣ven
can witness I am not ungrateful, but pray
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
the Gods to crown your Days with Happiness.”
“<HI>Constantia, reply'd he,</HI> if you are so much touch'd
with my good Intentions as you say, it is easy
for you to shew it.” “Alas! Sir, <HI>said she, somewhat
confused,</HI> what can I do for you?” “You may tell
me, <HI>added he,</HI> whom you meant by those words
you sung?” “As they are none of my making,
<HI>answer'd she,</HI> it is not in my power to satisfy you
therein.” While she was speaking, he perceived
that she blush'd, and was somewhat embarass'd,
and thereupon said, “Why, <HI>Constantia,</HI> do you con∣ceal
your Thoughts, since your Countenance be∣trays
too much the Secrets of your Heart? You
are in love.” Here he left off, to observe her with
more Attention: to which she reply'd, “Sir, what∣ever
things may concern me, cannot be worth a
great Prince's being inform'd of; besides, I am
so much used to silence with my Sheep, that I
must beg your pardon, if I answer not your Que∣stions.”
And then went away suddenly.</P>
<P>As Jealousy oftentimes helps to renew the Flames
of Love, the Prince's from that moment took such
force as never to be extinguish'd; he discover'd a
thousand new Charms in her Person, which he ne∣ver
had observed before; her manner of leaving
him, confirmed his Suspicion of her being in love
with some Shepherd: A profound Melancholy hung
over his Soul, he durst not follow her, tho desirous
of more Discourse with her; but laid himself down
on the same place she rose from, and after recol∣lecting
the words she had sung, writ them down
in his Pocket-Book, and examin'd them with great
Attention. “'Tis but lately, <HI>said he to himself,</HI> that
she has seen this <HI>Constantio,</HI> with whom she is
so much enamour'd; how came I to bear the same
Name, and not also to enjoy the same Good-for∣tune?
Alas! how coldly she look'd at me? She
shew'd more Indifference than when first I saw
her; her greatest care has been to find out a Pre∣text
to get away from me.” With these torment∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
Thoughts he rack'd his afflicted Soul, unable
to comprehend that a simple Shepherdess should
not have the least Inclination to a great Prince.
When he return'd to the Palace, he sent for a
young Lad, with whom he used to divert himself
sometimes, who was both of Birth and Fashion,
and one of the Prince's Attendants; he order'd him
to dress himself like a Shepherd, to feed a Flock
of Sheep in the Queen's Meadows, and to observe
<HI>Constantia,</HI> without being in the least suspected by
her. <HI>Mirtain,</HI> (which was his Name) too desirous
to please his Master to neglect any opportunity,
promised to acquit himself the best he could, and
prepared himself against the next Morning; when
he was admitted, by shewing an Order from the
Prince, and saying he was his Shepherd. He was
gallant, and found it no difficult matter to render
himself pleasing to the Shepherdesses; but for <HI>Con∣stantia,</HI>
he discover'd in her an Air of Pride above
what she seem'd to be, which made him think the
Country-Life she led could not be agreeable to so
much Wit, Beauty, and Merit: he followed her,
but all in vain, and found her always alone at the
bottom of the Wood, singing an Air which she
seem'd very much to delight in. He could meet
with no Shepherds that durst undertake to make
any Address, so difficult it appear'd to please her;
however, <HI>Mirtain</HI> attempted it, was always near
her, offering her some little Services, but found
by Experience, that she would not enter into any
Engagement.</P>
<P>Every night he gave the Prince an account of
the Situation of Affairs, all which contributed to
his despair. “Deceive not yourself, my Lord, <HI>said
he one day to him,</HI> this beautiful Damsel is certainly
in love, but then it is with one in her own
Country.” “If so, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI> why should
she not return home?” “How do we know, <HI>ad∣ded</HI>
Mirtain, but she may have some Reasons that
may oppose it? perhaps she may be enraged a∣gainst
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
her Lover.” “Alas! <HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> the
words I heard her sing were utter'd with too
much Tenderness; however, learn her Sentiments
of me, speak both well and ill of me: by that
means thou mayst come to know her Thoughts.”
<HI>Mirtain</HI> failed not to get an opportunity of Discourse
with <HI>Constantia,</HI> and among other things said, “Fair
Shepherdess, what is the matter with you? You
seem melancholy, notwithstanding all those Rea∣sons
you have to be otherwise.” “Pray, <HI>said she,</HI>
what are those Reasons? I am here a Stranger,
reduced to keep Sheep, and hear no News from
my Friends; where is the Agreeableness of all
this?” “But then, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> you are the most a∣miable
Person in the World; you have a great
share of Wit, a ravishing Voice, and a Beauty
not to be equal'd.” “Tho I am Mistress of all
these, <HI>said she, fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> of what advan∣tage
are they to me?” “What then, <HI>reply'd</HI> Mir∣tain,
you are ambitious, you think none but Kings
and Princes are happy? Be convinced of this Mi∣stake:
I belong to the Prince <HI>Constantio,</HI> and not∣withstanding
the Inequality of our Stations, am
sometimes nigh his Person, and can observe and
penetrate into the Actions of his Soul, and know
full well he is not happy.” “Alas! <HI>said the Prin∣cess,</HI>
what can trouble his Repose?” “A fatal Pas∣sion,
<HI>answer'd</HI> Mirtain.” “He is in love then, <HI>re∣ply'd
she, with some concern;</HI> alas! I pity him: But
what do I say, <HI>continued she, blushing,</HI> he is too
lovely, not to deserve a Return.” “He dares not
flatter himself, fair Shepherdess, <HI>said</HI> Mirtain, but
if you would give him any ease as to that point,
your Words would have more effect upon him
than any other Person's.” “It is no ways proper
for me, <HI>said she,</HI> to concern myself with the Af∣fairs
of so great a Prince; and those you speak to
me of, are too particular: Adieu, <HI>Mirtain, leaving
him suddenly,</HI> if you would oblige me, speak no
more of your Prince nor his Amours.”</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="75"/>
Thus she left <HI>Mirtain,</HI> tho no ways insensible of
the Merit of his Prince; for from the first time she
saw him, she had never been able to blot him out
of her Thoughts: and without this secret Charm,
which detain'd her against her own desire, it is cer∣tain
she would have endeavour'd to find out the
<HI>Sovereign Fairy.</HI> Besides, it may be expected, that
that knowing Person, who could not be ignorant of
all that pass'd, should come to look after her; but
that lay not in her power, for after the Giant
had found the Princess, she was forced to submit
to Fortune for a certain time, insomuch that the
Fairy was contented to come and see her in a Sun∣beam,
against which <HI>Constantia</HI> could not look sted∣fastly
enough to discern her.</P>
<P><HI>Constantia</HI> perceived with Rage, that the Prince
had neglected her, and that this second View was
entirely owing to Chance, that conducted him to
the Place where she was sat singing; she was vex'd
with herself for the Sentiments she entertain'd of
him, and if it is possible to love and hate at the
same time, I may say she hated, because she loved
too much. <HI>Ruson</HI> was the only Witness of the Tears
she shed secretly, sometimes she would confess her
Grief to him, as if he was capable of Understand∣ing;
and whenever he skip'd and play'd among the
other Sheep, she would cry out, “Take care, <HI>Ru∣son,</HI>
left Love inflame thee, which, without a Re∣turn,
is the greatest of all Misfortunes.” These
Reflections were follow'd by a thousand Reproaches
she made herself, for the Love she bore to a Prince
that appear'd so indifferent, whom she was striving
to forget; when she found him retired to that agree∣able
Shade, to think with more freedom on the
Shepherdess from whom he flew. There, surprized
with Sleep, he lay upon the Grass, when she came
and saw him; her Passion increased, and she
could not forbear making those words true, which
were the Cause of the Prince's Disquiet. But then,
what were her Torments, when <HI>Mirtain</HI> told her,
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
<HI>Constantio</HI> was in love? Whatever Restraint she put
upon herself, she could not help changing her Coun∣tenance;
at which <HI>Mirtain,</HI> whose business it was
to observe all her Actions, was not a little over∣joy'd,
and ran to acquaint his Master. The Prince,
who was not at that time so much disposed to flat∣ter
himself as his Confidant, fancied he saw no∣thing
but Indifference in all the Proceedings of that
Shepherdess, and accused the happy and beloved
<HI>Constantia.</HI> The next Morning he went to find her
out; she no sooner saw him, but she fled from
him, as if he had been a Lion or a Tyger, think∣ing
Flight the only Remedy that was left her: for
since her Conversation with <HI>Mirtain,</HI> she thought
she ought not to neglect the recovering of her
Heart again, and that the only means to succeed
therein, was to avoid him. But what became of
<HI>Constantio,</HI> when his Shepherdess left him so sud∣denly?
“You see, <HI>said he to</HI> Mirtain, <HI>who stood by
him,</HI> the happy Effects of what you have done;
<HI>Constantia</HI> hates me, I dare not follow her, to know
her Sentiments.” “Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Mirtain, you
shew too much Respect to a Country-Girl; if you
think fit, I will go and order her to come to you.”
“Ah! <HI>Mirtain, cry'd the Prince,</HI> thou art a Confidant,
not a Lover; my Thoughts are entirely bent up∣on
pleasing that lovely Damsel, I have discover'd
a Politeness in her, that I am sure those rough
ways of yours must be disagreeable to, and chuse
rather to endure my Pains, than displease her.”
As he made an end of these words, he went away
seized with a Melancholy deep enough to move the
Pity of an Heart less interested than <HI>Constantia</HI>'s.
As soon as he was gone, she return'd, to have the
satisfaction of sitting on the same spot of Ground
he had stood on. “It was here, <HI>said she,</HI> that he
stopt, it was from hence that he look'd at me;
but alas! in all these Places he has shewn but too
much Indifference for me, and comes only to en∣joy
the more freedom of his Thoughts on his
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
beloved Mistress: But what reason have I to com∣plain?
How is it possible he should engage him∣self
to a Girl that he thinks so much beneath
him?” Sometimes she was for informing him of
her Adventures, but the <HI>Sovereign Fairy</HI> had forbid
her so absolutely never to speak of them, that her
Obedience prevailed, and she resolved to keep them
secret.</P>
<P>Some days after the Prince came again, and she
avoided him as much as before; upon which he
was very much grieved, and ordered <HI>Mirtain</HI> to go
and load her with Reproaches from him, which she
pretended she did not understand, but at last con∣sented
to see his Master: which words were no
sooner out of her mouth, but <HI>Mirtain</HI> ran to ac∣quaint
the Prince, who long'd with impatience for
the Approach of the next Morn. It no sooner
appear'd, but he went to find his lovely Shepher∣dess;
she seem'd, at the first sight of him, speech∣less
and confused, and much more so when he de∣clared
his Passion: and notwithstanding her Desire
of believing him, she was afraid of being deceived,
thinking that he, looking upon her no otherwise
than as she appear'd to be, might only divert and
please himself, by making a Declaration no ways
suitable to a poor Shepherdess. Inraged at this
Thought, she became more proud, and received all
the Assurances of his Passion with a Coldness that
confirmed all his Suspicions. Upon which he said,
“I see you are engaged, some happy Swain has
known how to charm you; but bear me witness,
Heaven! if I find him out, he shall feel the Ef∣fects
of all my Rage.” “Sir, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> I ask no
favour for any one, and if you knew but the Sen∣timents
of my Heart, you would find them diffe∣rent
from what you think them to be.” At these
words the Prince conceiv'd some hopes, but those
were soon destroy'd by the Conversation they had
afterwards; for she protested her Indifference was
not to be overcome, and that she was very sensible
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
she could never love. These words again cast him
into an inexpressible Grief, which he constrain'd
as much as possible, that she might not perceive it.
In short, whether thro the Violence he did himself,
or the Excess of his Passion, which was become
stronger by the more Difficulties that opposed it,
he fell so dangerously ill, that the Physicians, not
knowing the Cause, despair'd of his Recovery. <HI>Mir∣tain,</HI>
who was by his Master order'd to attend on,
and follow <HI>Constantia,</HI> told her the dismal News,
which she heard with a Trouble and Concern not
to be conceiv'd. He ask'd her if she knew of no
Remedy for a Fever, and violent Pains of the Head
and Heart; to which she reply'd, she knew of one,
consisting of some Simples that she could gather,
but that it depended most on the manner of the
Application. “Will not you go to the Palace, <HI>said
he,</HI> to administer it!” “No, <HI>said she, blushing,</HI> I
am afraid it should not succeed.” “How, <HI>continued
he,</HI> can you neglect any thing to do us service on
this pressing Occasion? I always indeed thought
you cruel and hard-hearted, but now find you a
thousand times more so than I imagin'd.” These Re∣proaches
of <HI>Mirtain</HI>'s created a Pleasure in <HI>Constantia,</HI>
who was overjoy'd that he press'd her to see the
Prince; for the obtaining of which Satisfaction a∣lone,
she boasted of a Remedy to ease his Pains.</P>
<P><HI>Mirtain</HI> went and inform'd the Prince of all that
the Shepherdess said to him, and with what Ardour
she wish'd for his Health. “Ah! <HI>Mirtain, said</HI> Con∣stantio,
you intend to flatter me; but I forgive
you, and would willingly (durst I be deceived)
think that beautiful Maid has some Friendship for
me. Go and tell the Queen, that one of her
Shepherdesses hath a wonderful Secret to cure
me; get her leave, and bring my Charmer hither:
run, fly, for every moment seems an Age.” The
Queen, who had never seen this Shepherdess, said,
when <HI>Mirtain</HI> told her of <HI>Constantia,</HI> that she had no
faith in what such ignorant Persons pretended to
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
know, and that it was idle Talk. “Certainly, Ma∣dam,
<HI>said</HI> Mirtain, there is sometimes as much
Ease found in the use of some Simples, as from the
learned Prescriptions of the most eminent Physi∣cians;
and the Prince is very desirous of trying
what this young Damsel proposes.” “With all my
heart, <HI>said the Queen;</HI> but if she does not cure him,
I will use her so, as she shall never have the
Assurance to pretend to administer her Simples
any more.” <HI>Mirtain</HI> went and gave his Master an
account of the Queen's Ill-humour. The Prince
cry'd out, that he was afraid <HI>Constantia</HI> should feel
the Effects thereof, and order'd him to go back to
his Mother, to desire her from him, to let that fair
Maid stay with her harmless Sheep. “What a Re∣compence,
<HI>continued he,</HI> is this for her Pains! The
very Thoughts of it redouble my Disease.” <HI>Mir∣tain</HI>
acquitted himself of his Commission to the
Queen; but as she was naturally hasty, she flew
into a Passion at the fickleness of his Resolutions.
“I have already sent for her, <HI>said she,</HI> if she cures
my Son I shall give her a Reward; if not, I know
what I have to do: go and endeavour to divert
him, for his Melancholy grieves me.” <HI>Mirtain</HI>
obey'd, but acquainted not his Master with the re∣ception
he met with, lest his Fears for his Shep∣herde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
might do him a prejudice. The Pastures
belonging to the Crown being nigh the Town, it
was not long before she came; besides, those who
are guided by Love, are seldom slow. The Queen
did not think fit to see her, contenting herself with
bidding her take care what she did, and assuring
her, if she did not cure the Prince, she should be
put into a Sack, and thrown into the River. At
this Menace the beautiful Princess turn'd pale, and
her Blood ran chill in her Veins. “Alas! <HI>said she
to herself,</HI> I deserve this Punishment for the Lye I
have told, when I boasted of my Skill; and I
fear my desire of seeing <HI>Constantio,</HI> will not be a
sufficient Reason for the Gods to protect me.”
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
Then hanging down her Head, the Tears ran trick∣ling
from her fair Eyes. Those that were by, ad∣mired
her so much, that they took her to be more
like an Angel than a Mortal, and said, Fear no∣thing,
lovely Shepherdess, your Eyes carry in them
Life and Death; one Glance from them is able to
recover our young Prince: go into his Chamber, dry
up your Tears, and apply your Remedy without Fear.</P>
<P>This manner of speaking, together with her ex∣treme
desire to see the Prince, inspir'd her with
some Confidence. She begg'd leave to go into the
Garden to gather what was necessary for the Cure,
where she took some Myrtle, Trefoil, and other
Herbs and Flowers dedicated to <HI>Cupid</HI> and his Mo∣ther;
the Feathers of a Dove, some Drops of a
Pidgeon's Blood, and call'd upon all the Deities and
Fairies for their Aid: and then trembling more than
a Turtle when she sees a Kite hovering o'er her
head, bid them conduct her to the Prince's Cham∣ber.
When she came there, she found him in
Bed, his Face pale as Death, and his Eyes lan∣guishing;
but as soon as he saw her, some streams
of colour flow'd up into his Cheeks, which she
observed with great joy. “Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> I have
often offer'd up my Prayers to Heaven for the
Recovery of your Health, and my Zeal engaged
me to tell one of your Shepherds that I knew
of a Remedy, which I would willingly make use
of to ease you; but the Queen has told me, that
if Heaven should abandon me in this Undertaking,
she will put me to death. Judge, Sir, of my Fears,
and be persuaded that I am more interested in the
preservation of your Health than my own Life.”
“Fear nothing, charming Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> the
favourable Vows you made for my Life, will ren∣der
it so dear to me, that all my endeavours shall
be to preserve it. Alas! how can my days be
more happy, when I remember what I heard you
sing of <HI>Constantio?</HI> Those fatal Words, and your
Rigour, have reduced; me to the Condition you
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
see me in; but, fair Shepherdess, you bid me live,
and I will live for you.” It was with difficulty
that <HI>Constantia</HI> concealed the pleasure so obliging a
Declaration created in her Soul; and fearing lest
some Person might hear what the Prince said to
her, she ask'd him, if he would give her leave to
put on a Bandage and Bracelets of the Herbs she
had gather'd; at which he held out his Arm in a
tender manner, and she tied on one of the Brace∣lets
presently, having first perform'd some little
Ceremonies to amuse the Prince's Court. The
Prince cry'd out a few moments after, that he was
better; and the Physicians being call'd in, were
surprized at the Excellence of a Medicine, the Ef∣fects
of which were so quick: but when they saw
the Shepherdess that apply'd it, their Amazement
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anish'd; and they said to one another, that there
was more virtue in one Look from her, than all
their Medicines together. The Shepherdess was
so little affected with the Praises they bestow'd on
her, that those that knew her not, took that for
Stupidity which proceeded from a different Cause;
for she placed herself behind one of the Bed-Cur∣tains,
hiding herself from every one but her sick
Patient, whose Head and Pulse she often stoop'd to
feel; and in those little opportunities they said
thousands of tender things to each other. “I hope,
Sir, <HI>said she to him,</HI> the Sack the Queen provided
for to drown me in, will be put to a better use,
since your Health, which is so precious to me, is
in a fair way of being restored.” “It depends en∣tirely
on you, lovely <HI>Constantia, replied he;</HI> a little
Share in your Heart will compleat both my Health
and Happiness.” She rose soon after and went to
the Queen's Apartment, who, when she was told
the Prince was coming, would not believe it, but
was very much surprized to meet him at her Cham∣ber-Door.
“What! Is it you, my dear Child? <HI>cry'd
she:</HI> To whom am I obliged for this?” “To your
own Bounty, Madam, <HI>replied he,</HI> in sending me
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
the most abl Person in the World; whom I de∣sire
you to recompence according to the Benefit I
have received from her.” “Never mind that, <HI>said
the Queen in a careless manner,</HI> she is a poor Shep∣herdess
who will think herself happy to keep my
Sheep, trouble not yourself about that.” The King
coming in just upon this, and being told the good
News of the Prince's Recovery, and his being with
the Queen; as he was making towards that Apart∣ment,
<HI>Constantia</HI> was the first Object that struck his
Eyes: her Beauty, like the Sun shining among the
lesser Lights, dazzled him so much, that he was
some time before he could ask those about him
what she was, and how long Goddesses had inhabi∣ted
his Palace; at last recovering himself, he went
towards her, and knowing her to be the Inchan∣tress
that had cured his Son, imbraced her, and
told her in a gallant manner, that if he should be
ill, he would beg of her to cure him too, and then
bid her follow him. The Amazement of the Queen,
who had never seen her before, is not to be expres∣sed;
she gave a great Shriek, and fell into a Fit,
looking all the time with an enraged Eye on the
Shepherdess. <HI>Constantio</HI> and <HI>Constantia</HI> were both
frighted; the King knew not what to attribute it
to, and the whole Court were in the utmost 'Con∣sternation:
when at last the Queen came to herself
again, the King ask'd often what was the Cause,
but she dissembling her Uneasiness, said it was on∣ly
the Vapours: at which the Prince, who knew
better, was very much concerned. She bid the
Shepherdess, with some seeming sort of Kindness,
to stay; telling her that she design'd her to look af∣ter
the Flowers in her Parterre, which Employ the
Princess was very much pleased with, to think she
might have an opportunity of seeing <HI>Constantio</HI> every
day.</P>
<P>Some time after, the King obliged the Queen to
go with him into his Closet, where he ask'd her
tenderly what vex'd her. “Alas! <HI>cry'd she,</HI> I dreamt
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
that my Son was married to a young Shepherd∣dess;
and tho I never saw this young Girl in my
life before, yet I had so strong an Idea of her
Person in my Dream, that I knew her again as
soon as I fix'd my Eyes on her, and shall be very
much deceiv'd if this sorry Country Girl does not
give me great cause to be afflicted.” “You give too
much way, <HI>said the King,</HI> to such Fancies; I would
advise you not to act upon such Principles: send
this Shepherdess back to her Flock, and don't
grieve yourself with such a ridiculous Conceit.”
This Advice of the King's was no ways acceptable
to the Queen, who, instead of following it, apply'd
herself to penetrate into her Son's Sentiments of
<HI>Constantia.</HI> The Prince took all opportunities that
offer'd, to see her; and as it was her business to
look after the Flowers, he fancied that every time
she touch'd them they appear'd more beautiful.
<HI>Ruson</HI> was still her Companion; to him, tho he could
not answer her, she would be often talking of the
Prince: and whenever he approach'd towards her,
she was so embarass'd, that her Eyes plainly dis∣cover'd
the Secrets of her Soul; that which, the
overjoy'd Prince would say all the tender things a
violent Passion could inspire. The Queen, on the
Credit of her Dream, and much more on the ac∣count
of <HI>Constantia</HI>'s incomparable Beauty, could
not sleep in quiet, but rose before day, and hid
herself, sometimes behind the Palisadoes, and at
the bottom of a Grotto, to hear her Son's Discourse
with that fair Maid; but as they were both so
wise as to talk low, she could gather nothing to
support her Suspicions, which made her the more
uneasy. She look'd on the Prince with the utmost
Disdain, and was in continual Fears night and day,
lest that Shepherdess should ascend the Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Constantio</HI> had as strict a guard upon himself as
was possible; but nevertheless every body almost
perceived his Love of <HI>Constantia:</HI> for whenever he
praised her, through his wonted Custom of admiring
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
her, or found fault with her, he did both like an
interested Person: and for <HI>Constantia,</HI> she also could
not forbear speaking of the Prince to her Compa∣nions;
and as she often sung those words she made
for him, the Queen who heard her, was no less
surprized at her captivating Voice, than at the
Subject of her Poetry. “What have I done, just
Heaven, <HI>said she,</HI> to be punish'd in the most sen∣sible
manner? Alas! I design'd my Son for my
Neice, and to my mortal grief, see him engaged
to a Wretch, who may, perhaps, make him guilty
of Disobedience.”</P>
<P>While she was afflicting herself after this manner,
and ruminating upon a thousand furious Projects to
punish <HI>Constantia,</HI> for being so beautiful and charm∣ing,
Love made a farther Progress in the Hearts of
the two young Lovers. <HI>Constantia,</HI> convinc'd of the
Sincerity of the Prince, could no longer conceal her
Birth and Sentiments from him. A Confession so
tender, and so particular a Confidence, ravish'd him
so much with Joy, that if they had been in any
other Place besides the Queen's Garden, he would
have cast himself at her Feet to thank her. His Pas∣sion
was no longer to be resisted; he loved <HI>Constantia</HI>
when a Shepherdess, and we may easily believe
adored her, when he knew her Rank: And if a
Princess's wandring through the World, sometimes
as a Shepherdess, and sometimes a Gardener, might
seem extraordinary, at that time those things were
very common; and the Princess's Air and Manner
of Address were convincing Proofs of the Sincerity
of her Words.</P>
<P><HI>Constantio,</HI> moved by Love and Esteem, swore an
eternal Fidelity to the Princess, as she did also to
him, promising to marry as soon as they should ob∣tain
the Consent of those whom Duty requir'd them
to demand it of. The Queen perceiv'd the Strength
of this growing Passion, and was more sensible of
it, when one day her Confidant, who desired no∣thing
more than to find something to gain her Fa∣vour
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
by, came to tell her, that <HI>Constantia</HI> sent <HI>Ruson</HI>
every Morning into the Prince's Apartment, and
that that Sheep carried two Baskets full of Flow∣ers,
and that <HI>Mirtain</HI> led him. The Queen, at this
News, lost all patience; and as she knew which
way poor <HI>Ruson</HI> was to pass, waited for him; and,
notwithstanding <HI>Mirtain</HI>'s Prayers and Intreaties,
carried him into her Chamber: where she tore the
Baskets and Flowers in pieces, and found in a large
Lilly a piece of Paper curiously wrapt up by <HI>Con∣stantia,</HI>
wherein she reproach'd the Prince with the
Dangers he expos'd himself to in Hunting. The
Lines were thus:</P>
<LG>
<L>In the midst of all my Joy,</L>
<L>Chilling Fears croud in apace.</L>
<L>Anxious Cares my Breast invade,</L>
<L>While you pursue the Chase.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell me, ye Powers, wherein consist</L>
<L>These Charms, that thus ingage;</L>
<L>Charms that can my Prince invite,</L>
<L>And tempt his Godlike Rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn! Oh! turn your cconquering Arms,</L>
<L>Against more yielding Hearts;</L>
<L>Wolves and Bears fly from your Spears,</L>
<L>The Fair embrace your Darts.</L>
</LG>
<P>While the Queen was venting her Rage against
the Shepherdess, <HI>Mirtain</HI> went to give his Master an
account of what had happen'd. The Prince, uneasy
thereat, ran into his Mother's Chamber; who at
that time was gone to the King's, to tell him. “Be∣hold,
Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> the noble Inclinations of your
Son! he is in love with the Shepherdess that pre∣tended
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure him. Alas! <HI>continued she,</HI> she knew
how too well, 'twas Love instructed her: she has
restored him his Health, to make him more mise∣rable;
and if we don't prevent the Misfortune
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
with which we are threatned, my Dream will
prove but too true.” “You are naturally too
severe, <HI>said the King,</HI> and would have your Son
think of no other Person but the Princess you de∣sign
to marry him to; you must indulge his Years.”
“I cannot bear, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI> your taking his
part, you can never find fault with him; all that
I ask of you, is, to consent that I send him away
from Court for some time; Absence may have
more effect than all my Arguments.” The King,
who was a Man that loved a quiet Life, agreed to
what his Queen desired; and she return'd back to
her own Apartment, where she found the Prince
waiting for her with the utmost Impatience.
“Child, <HI>said she to him, before he could speak to her,</HI> the
King has been shewing me a Letter from the King
my Brother, wherein, he begs of him to send
you to his Court, that you may contract a Friend∣ship
with the Princess, his Daughter, whom we
have a design you shall marry; it being proper
you should judge of each other's Merit, and en∣gage
your Affections.” “Madam, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI>
I ask nothing so particular in my favour; neither
is it customary for Princes to go on such Occa∣sions,
and to consult their Hearts before Reasons
of State: My Obedience shall be the same, whe∣ther
the Person be beautiful or deformed,
witty or otherwise.” “I understand you, Repro∣bate,
<HI>said she in a Passion,</HI> you love a base Shep∣herdess,
and are afraid of leaving her; but you
shall, or see her die before your face: but if you
are ready to go, and will endeavour to forget her, I'll
keep her here, and love her as much as now I hate.”
The Prince, who turn'd as pale as Death, reason'd
with himself what to do in this Urgency, he knew
his Mother to be a most cruel and revengful Prin∣cess,
and fear'd lest his Opposition might exaspe∣rate
her so much, that his dear Mistress would feel the
Effects of her Resentment: In short, being close∣ly
press'd, he consented at last, like one who con∣sents
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
to drink a Glass of Poison; and no sooner
had given his Word, but he left his Mother, and
return'd to his own Apartment, with a Heart so
oppress'd, that he thought he should die. He told
the faithful <HI>Mirtain</HI> his Affliction, and impatient to
let his <HI>Constantia</HI> know the Cause of it, went to the
Grott, where she used generally to retire from the
Heats of the Sun, to comb her delicate Locks, and
adjust herself. There he found her sat on the
Grass by a Brook-side, which fell from the height
of a Rock, with her Feet in the Water; the a∣greeable
Murmurs of which, together with the
Fatigue of her Work, having invited her insen∣sibly
to taste the Sweets of a gentle Sleep. Her
Eyes, though closed, preserved a thousand Beau∣ties;
her long black Eye-lashes set off the White∣ness
of her Skin; the Loves and Graces seem'd to
surround her, and Modesty and Sweetness to augment
her Charms. The amorous Prince remembred,
that the first time he beheld her, he saw her thus
asleep; but since then, his Sentiments of her were
become so tender, that he would willingly have
surrendred up half his Life, to enjoy the other half
with her: He gazed upon her some time, with a
Pleasure that suspended his Grief; then running
over all her Beauties, discovered her Foot as white
as Snow, which he could not forbear admiring,
and approaching nigher, fell on his Knees, and
took her by the hand: upon which she waked,
seeming vex'd that he should see her bare Foot, and
hid it with a Blush upon her Cheecks, surpassing
the Rose opening to the Morning Sun. But alas!
of what continuance was it? She observ'd a deep
Melancholy in the Prince's Face, and said to him
frighted; “What is the matter with you, Sir, I
know by your Eyes you are troubled.” “Ah!
Who can be otherwise, my dear Princess? <HI>said he,
shedding some Tears:</HI> we must part, I must go and
leave you exposed to my Mother's Rage; she
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
knows the Love I bear you; the Billet you sent
me fell into her hands, and she, insensible to my
Grief, is sending me to the King her Brother.”
“What's this you tell me, Prince! <HI>cry'd she,</HI> you
are going to leave me, as the Means necessary to
preserve my Life! How could you imagine such
Means? Let me die rather before your Eyes,
than live without you.”</P>
<P>So tender a Discourse could not fail of being ac∣companied
and interrupted by Sighs and Tears:
The two young Lovers never knew nor foresaw
the Cruelties of Absence before; they swore a
thousand times never to change, and the Prince
promised a quick Return, assuring her, that he
would affront both his Uncle and his Daughter, so
as to make them lay aside all thoughts of an Al∣liance:
“I will strive, <HI>said he,</HI> to displease the
Princess, and am sure I shall succeed.” “Then
you must not shew yourself, <HI>said</HI> Constantia, for
if you do, you will please in spight of yourself,”
Then they cry'd again bitterly, looking at each o∣ther
with a piercing Grief, and making such re∣ciprocal
Promises, that if they had any Comfort, it
was in the Assurance of their Love and Fidelity.
In this melting Conversation the time ran away so
fast, that it was dark night before they thought of
parting. When the Queen, having a mind to set∣tle
the Prince's Equipage with him, sent to <HI>Mirtain,</HI>
to acquaint his Master with it, whom he found at
his Mistress's feet, holding one of her Hands be∣tween
his. As soon as they saw him, they
were both so struck, that they could not speak:
However, he delivered the Queen's Message to the
Prince, who durst not disobey her Commands, but
took his leave of his Princess. The Queen, when
she saw him, found him so melancholy, and so
much altered, that, guessing at the Cause of it, she
would not speak. Nevertheless, every thing was
prepared with the same diligence, while he was
altogether taken up with his Passion. He made
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
<HI>Mirtain</HI> stay at Court, to send him news of the
Princess, with whom he left a great many rich
Jewels, to serve in case of necessity. The Despair
of our Lovers is not to be expressed, when the
Prince went: And if any thing mitigated it, it was
the Hopes of seeing each other soon again. 'Twas
then <HI>Constantia</HI> was most sensible of the Greatness of
her Misfortune, of being the Daughter of a rich
and powerful King, and in the hands of a cruel
Queen, who had sent away her Son, for fear of her,
who was no ways his inferiour.</P>
<P>The Queen now overjoy'd that her Son was
gone, applied herself to the intercepting all his
Letters, succeeded therein, and knew <HI>Mirtain</HI> to
be his Confidant, whom, thereupon, she ordered
under a false Pretext to be arrested and sent to a
dismal Prison. The Prince, when he heard of it,
was very much inraged, and writ Letters to the
King and Queen to demand his Favourite's Liber∣ty;
but all his Instances had no effect. But this
was not all; for one Morning, when the Princess
rose to gather some Flowers, according to custom,
for the Queen's Toilet, she saw the faithful <HI>Ruson,</HI>
who went before her, come trembling to her, and
advancing forwards to see what was the Cause,
heard a hissing of Snakes, and was surrounded by
Toads, Vipers, Scorpions, Aspicks, and Adders,
which made many vain Leaps at her, and always
fell down again upon the same Spot of Ground:
Notwithstanding the fright she was in, she could
not but take notice of this Prodigy, and could at∣tribute
it to nothing but a Ring given by her Lover.
Which way soever she turn'd, those venomous
Animals fled before her; the Alleys, and all the
Flower-beds were full of them: insomuch, that
the beautiful <HI>Constantia</HI> knew not what would be∣come
of her; and saw the Queen at her Window
laughing, and from thence judged, it was in vain
to flatter herself with any Expectation of Assistance
from her Orders. “I know I must die, <HI>said she,
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
courageously,</HI> these Monsters came not here of them∣selves,
but have been brought by the Queen's
Command, who is come herself to be a Specta∣tor
of the deplorable end of my Life, which has
hitherto been so unhappy, that I have no reason to
be fond of it; but if I do in some measure regret
the loss of it, the just Gods can witness on what
account it is.” After this she advanced boldly for∣wards;
the Snakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made off from her as fast
as she made towards them; and so she got out of
the Garden, at which she was as much amazed as
the Queen, who had been a long time providing
these dangerous Creatures to destroy her, thinking
that her Son would believe her death accidental, and
she by this means should skreen herself from his
Reproaches: but this Project failing, she had re∣course
to this other.</P>
<P>There lived at the farther side of a large Forest
a Fairy, whose Abode was render'd inaccessible by
Elephants that devoured all Travellers; with this
Fairy the Queen had agreed, that if any Person
should come from her unhurt, to send them back
again with some that would be sure to kill them.
Her other Plot miscarrying, she sent for <HI>Constantia,</HI>
and order'd her to go thither with a Message she
gave her. The Princess, who knew the Queen
would be absolutely obey'd, prepar'd to set out for
the dangerous Journey she was to undertake; and
reflecting on the Dangers she had heard her Com∣panions
tell of, she remembred that an old Shep∣herdess
had said, that those Elephants were very
gentle when they saw either a Sheep or a Lamb;
and that when the Fairy sent the burning Girdle to
the Queen, for fear lest the Queen should make
her put it on, she had fasten'd it upon several Trees
which it fired, till it had lost all its force; but
little thought, when she heard this Story, that it
might one day be serviceable to her. In short, she
took <HI>Ruson,</HI> and set forwards on her Journey; and
the Queen, who was mighty well pleased thereat,
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
could not forbear telling the King, that they should
never see the hated Object of their Son's Affections
any more, since she had sent her to the Forest,
whence she could never return: upon which the
King told her she was too revengeful, and that he
could not but have some Regret for the death of
so beautiful a Creature.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Constantia</HI> arrived at the Forest,
and was presently surrounded by the Elephants; but
those dreadful Creatures no sooner saw <HI>Ruson,</HI> but
they caress'd him with their Trunks as gently as
the finest Lady could with her fair Hand: and then
the Princess, fearing lest they should separate their In∣terests,
took <HI>Ruson</HI> in her Arms, and which way so∣ever
she turn'd, always presented him; and by that
means reach'd the Fairy's Abode, the Rudeness and
Desolation of which frighten'd her, as much as the
old Woman herself, who in all respects answer'd
her dwelling-place. “What is it you want, fair
Maid? <HI>said she.</HI>” To which the Princess reply'd,
That the Queen presented her Duty and Service
to her, and desired her to send the Girdle of
<HI>Friendship.</HI>” “She shall not be denied, <HI>said the old
Fairy,</HI> I know it is for you.” And then putting her
Hand into a long Pocket she wore by her Side,
pull'd out a Girdle of blue Velvet, and gave it her,
saying, “This Girdle will make you most exqui∣sitely
beautiful, provided you wear it as soon as
you are in the Forest.” <HI>Constantia</HI> made a Courtesy,
and thank'd her; and then took up <HI>Ruson,</HI> who
was as useful as before: however, she did not for∣get
to put the Girdle of <HI>Friendship</HI> about a Tree,
which immediately was all in flames; and after
that, she girt it about several, till all its virtue was
spent; and at last came back to Court very much
tired. The Queen was so surprized when she saw
her, that she could not speak for a long time; and
when she recovered herself, told her she was a
false saucy Baggage, for that she had not been with
the Fairy. <HI>Constantia</HI> affirmed she had, and that she
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
had brought the Girdle of <HI>Friendship:</HI> upon which
the Queen ask'd her if she had put it on; and the
other reply'd, it was too rich for a poor Shep∣herdess
to wear. “No, no, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> I give
it you for your pains, besure to gird it about
your Waist; but tell me what you met with in
your Travels.” Hereupon <HI>Constantia</HI> told her how
she had met with Elephants so sensible and tame,
that she could not but admire them; that the Fo∣rest
seem'd like their Kingdom, wherein some paid
great Respect to others: and the Queen, tho vex'd
at this relation, yet disguised her Rage, hoping the
Girdle would compleat her Desires.</P>
<P><HI>Constantia</HI> retired to her Chamber, where she be∣wailed
the absence of her dear Prince, to whom
she durst not write, because the Queen had Spies
abroad that intercepted all Letters and Messengers.
“Alas! <HI>Constantio, said she,</HI> you will shortly hear
dismal News of me; you should not have gone,
and left me exposed to your Mother's Violences:
you would have defended me, or receiv'd my last
Sighs; whereas I am now in the power of her
Tyranny, and have none to comfort me.” The
next Morning she went with the Girdle about her
Waist, to work in the Garden as usual; where she
found the same venomous Creatures again, which
her Ring secured her from. And when the Queen
perceiv'd her gathering Flowers, and well; she
burst out into an extravagancy of Passion. “What
Power, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> interposes in this Shepherdess's
behalf? By her Beauty she has bewitch'd my
Son, and by her Simples restored him his Health,
and can walk unhurt in the midst of Adders and
Aspicks. The Elephants were tame and gentle
at the sight of her; and the Girdle that should
burn and consume her, serves only to adorn her:
therefore I must use some other means.” There∣upon
she sent the Captain of her Guards, in whom
she could confide, to the Port, to see if there
were any Vessels ready to sail for a long Voyage;
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
and he return'd, and told her there was one which
was design'd to sail the beginning of the Night.
This News was very agreeable to the Queen, who
immediately sent for the Master to come and buy a
beautiful Slave; who when he came to the Palace,
and saw <HI>Constantia</HI> (who knew nothing of what was
in agitation) in the Garden, was so surprized with
the Charms of this incomparable Maid, that the
Queen, who was very covetous, took the advan∣tage
of it, and sold her at a considerable Price. It
happen'd that Night that <HI>Constantia</HI> retired very ear∣ly
to her Chamber, to amuse and indulge her
Thoughts on <HI>Constantio,</HI> and to answer a Letter of
his which she had by some Stratagem receiv'd; the
which she was reading when the Queen enter'd
her Room, follow'd by the Captain of her Guards,
and two Mutes, who stopt her Mouth with a Hand∣kerchief,
and carried her away. <HI>Ruson</HI> would have
follow'd his dear Mistress, but the Queen catch'd
hold of him, and prevented him; fearing lest his
Bleatings might discover what she had a mind should
be done privately. And thus <HI>Constantia,</HI> having none
to assist her, was transported aboard the Vessel,
which hoisted Sail immediately after.</P>
<P>Here we must leave her to the mercy of the Sea,
her new Master, and to cruel Fortune; for the
Sovereign Fairy could not prevail with Fate in her
favour: and all she could do, was to follow her un∣seen
in a dark Cloud. In the mean time the Prince
<HI>Constantio,</HI> wholly taken up with his Passion, paid no
regard to the Princess that was design'd him; and
tho he was naturally the most polite Prince in the
World, was guilty of several rude and unmannerly
Actions, which she often complain'd of to her Fa∣ther,
who reprov'd his Nephew for it, and so the
March went rather off than came on. At this very
nick of time the Queen thought fit to write to the
Prince, to let him know that <HI>Constantia</HI> was at the
point of death; which News created so much Grief
in the Prince, that without observing any Ceremo∣nies
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
of taking his leave, he set out with all speed
to come and see her; but notwithstanding all his
haste, came too late: for the Queen foreseeing that
he would return as soon as he receiv'd her Letter,
had for several Days before caused a Report to be
given out that <HI>Constan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a</HI> was very ill, and some time
after another that she was dead; and to confirm it,
buried a Figure of Wax: and to convince the Prince
the more of the Truth of it, released <HI>Mirtain</HI> out
of Prison to assist at the Funeral of this charming
Maid, who was regretted by all the Court, and for
the loss of whom, the Queen, on her Son's account,
seem'd to be under some concern.</P>
<P>The Prince arrived soon after in all the Fears
and Uneasiness imaginable; and when he enter'd
first the City, impatient to know how his dear
<HI>Constantia</HI> did, happening to ask some People who
knew him not, and being told she was dead, he
fell off from his Horse senseless and speechless, and
being known by the Crowd which gather'd about
him to be the Prince, he was carried for dead to
the Palace. The King was sensibly touch'd with
the miserable condition of his Son; but the Queen,
who was prepared before-hand, believed that Time
and the Loss of his most tender Hopes might cure
him: but he was too deeply affected to admit of
any Comfort. His Grief, instead of diminishing,
increased every moment, and he kept his Room se∣veral
days, without seeing or hardly speaking to
any one; when one day oppress'd with his Sorrow,
he went into the Queen's Apartment with Tears
in his Eyes, his Face as meagre and pale as Death,
and told her she had been the cause of his beloved
<HI>Constantia</HI>'s death, and that she would shortly be
punished for the same, since he was resolved to
die also, and would go to the Place where she was
buried. The Queen unable to dissuade him from it,
resolved to go with him herself to a Wood planted
with Cypress, where she had raised a Tomb over
her. When the Prince came there, he said all the
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
tender and compassionate things any Man could
invent, which made the Queen, notwithstanding
her natural Hardness of Heart, melt into Tears.
<HI>Mirtain</HI> took on as much as his Master, and all that
heard him shared in his Affliction. At last, all on a
sudden, inraged with the disappointment of his Pas∣sion,
he drew his Sword, and approaching the
marble Monument, had kill'd himself, if the Queen
and <HI>Mirtain</HI> had not held his Arm. “No, <HI>cry'd he,</HI>
nothing shall prevent my dying and being with
my dear Princess.” The Name of Princess surpri∣zed
the Queen, and had made her fancy he raved,
had he not spoke rationally in other things. She
asked him why he called <HI>Constantia</HI> a Princess; to
which he answer'd, because she was one, and So∣vereign
of the Kingdom of <HI>Deserts.</HI> “Well Child,
<HI>said the Queen,</HI> since <HI>Constantia</HI> is of birth suitable
to yours, comfort yourself, she is not dead; for
now I must own to you, to mitigate your Grief,
I have sold her to a Merchant for a Slave.” “Ah!
<HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> what you tell me is only to sus∣pend
my design of dying; but my Resolution is
fix'd, nothing shall hinder it.” Then said the
Queen, “Your own Eyes must convince you of
the truth of my Words.” And thereupon she or∣der'd
the Figure of Wax to be dug up. The Prince,
as soon as he saw it, believed it to be the Body of
his lovely Princess, and fainted away; they endea∣vour'd
to bring him to himself again, but all in
vain: The Queen assured him she was not dead;
but after the Trick she had play'd her, he could
not believe her, till <HI>Mirtain,</HI> whom he knew lov'd
him, and who was not capable of telling him a
Lye, confirm'd it.</P>
<P>From that moment the Prince found some Ease,
because of all Misfortunes Death is the most terri∣ble;
and he might yet flatter himself with the
hopes of seeing her again: but then he knew not
where to seek her, nor who the Merchant was,
who never made the least mention whither he was
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
bound. All these were great Difficulties, but what
are those, true Love will not surmount? The
Prince chose perishing, in pursuing the Ravishers,
a thousand times, before living without her, and
reproach'd the Queen as often for her Cruelty;
telling her she might repent of what she had done,
since he was resolved to go, and never come back
again. The afflicted Mother cast her Arms about
her Son's Neck, wet his Face with her Tears, and
conjur'd him, by the Regard he had to his Father's
and Mother's Years, and the Love and Friendship
he bore them, not to leave them; telling him, that
if he deprived them of the Happiness of seeing
him, it would be the cause of their Deaths; that
he was their only Hope, and that when he was
gone, their Neighbours and Enemies would seize
upon the Kingdom. All which the Prince listen'd
to with a Coldness and Respect, having the ill U∣sage
she had given <HI>Constantia</HI> always in his Thoughts,
and without her he despised all the Crowns in the
World; insomuch that he persisted, with a surpri∣zing
Firmness, in the Resolution of going the next
day. The King endeavour'd to persuade him to
stay, but all in vain, for nothing could prevail with
him; the night he spent in leaving Orders with
<HI>Mirtain,</HI> giving him the Charge of the faithful <HI>Ru∣son,</HI>
and a great many rich Jewels, telling him, that
he should hear from him, provided he was secret,
being willing to create the Queen as much Unea∣siness
as possible.</P>
<P>Before day, the impatient <HI>Constantio</HI> took horse,
yielding himself up entirely to Fortune, desiring her
only to be so favourable as to direct him where he
might find his dear Mistress again. Whither to go, he
knew not; but as she was carried on board a Ves∣sel,
he thought it would be the best way to find
her, to embark on board one too: to this end he
made towards the most noted Port, and being there
unaccompanied and unknown, inform'd himself of
the most distant Parts, and of all the Coasts, Ports,
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
and Havens they could put in at, and then went
on board a Vessel, in hopes that a Passion so vio∣lent
and pure as his would not always be unsuc∣cessful.</P>
<P>Whenever they came nigh any Land, he always
put out a Sloop, and row'd along by the Shore,
calling upon <HI>Constantia,</HI> venting his Sighs and Com∣plaints
to the pityless Winds to convey them to the
Shore; and then return'd back to the Ship over∣whelm'd
with Grief, and his Eyes bathed in Tears.
One night, that they came to an Anchor behind a
large Rock, he went on the shore as usual; but as
they knew not the Country, and the Night was
very dark, those that were along with him would
not venture any farther for fear of Danger. The
Prince, who valued not his Life to find out the
Object of his Wishes, kept going forwards, often
falling and getting up again, till at last he disco∣ver'd
a great Light, that seem'd to come from some
large Fire; and approaching nigher towards it,
heard a great noise of Hammers, that gave terri∣ble
Strokes: far from being afraid, he made all
possible haste forwards, till he came to a great
open Forge, in the Furnace of which was so great
a Fire, that it look'd as bright as the Sun; here
thirty <HI>Cy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps</HI> were at work, making Arms. <HI>Constan∣tio</HI>
went up to them, and said, “If you are capable
of entertaining any Pity in the midst of Fire and
Steel, tell me if you have seen the beautiful <HI>Con∣stantia</HI>
land here, and I will give you whatever
you shall demand.” He had no sooner said thus,
but the Noise, that ceased at his first Arrival, was
renew'd with much more Violence: “Alas! <HI>said he,</HI>
the <HI>barbarous Wretches</HI> are no ways touch'd with
my Grief; what can I expect from them?” And
just as he was about to leave them, he heard a
soft Symphony that ravished his Senses; and look∣ing
towards the Furnace, saw the most beautiful
Child Fancy could ever represent, brighter than
the Fire he came out of. When he consider'd his
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
Charms, the Bandage over his Eyes, his Bow and
Quiver by his Side, he no longer doubted but that
it was <HI>Cupid;</HI> who cry'd out to him, “Stay, <HI>Con∣stantio,</HI>
you burn with too pure a Flame for me
to refuse my Assistance: I am called <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtuous-Love;</HI>
'twas I that wounded you with <HI>Constantia,</HI> and de∣fended
her against the Giant that persecuted her.
The <HI>Sovereign Fairy</HI> is my intimate Friend, we
have engaged to protect her; but I must make a
tryal of your Passion, before I discover where she
is.” “Command, <HI>Love,</HI> command what you think
fit, <HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> I will not disobey thee.” “Then
throw yourself into this Fire, <HI>reply'd the Child;</HI> but
remember, if you love not faithfully, you are
lost.” “I have no reason to fear that,” <HI>said</HI> Con∣stantio;
and immediately threw himself into the
Furnace, where he lost all Sense presently: He
slept thirty Hours, and when he awaked, found
himself changed into a most beautiful Pidgeon, and
instead of being in the terrible Furnace, on a Nest
of Roses, Jessamines, and Honey-suckles. Never
was any Surprize greater than his, to see his rough
Feet, his Skin stuck full of Feathers of various Co∣lours,
and his Eyes, as he beheld them in a Brook,
as red as Fire; he attempted several times to utter
his Complaints, but found he had lost the Use of
his Speech, tho he had recover'd his Senses. He
look'd upon this Metamorphosis as the compleatest
of all Misfortunes: “Ah! perfidious <HI>Love, thought
he to himself,</HI> is this the Recompence thou givest
the most perfect of all Lovers? The False, the
Fickle, and Forsworn, are favour'd by thee, while
thou tormentest the True and Faithful. What can
I promise myself from so extraordinary a Figure
as mine, a poor Pidgeon? Could I speak, I would
fly high and low, and search after my Mistress
thro all different Climates, and inform myself of
every one I met; but I am debarred the Liberty
of pronouncing her Name, and the only Remedy
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
left me, is to throw myself off some Precipice,
and willingly embrace my Death.”</P>
<P>Possess'd with this fatal Resolution, he flew to
the top of a high Mountain, and from thence cast
himself down, but forgot, having not been long a
Pidgeon, that his Wings and Feathers would keep
him up: thereupon he resolved to unplume himself,
and accordingly put this Design in execution. As
soon as he had quite stript himself, he walked up
to the top of a high Rock, to attempt his Destruc∣tion
once more, where he was surprized by two
young Damsels, that came suddenly upon him;
who, as soon as they saw him, said one to another,
“Where has this poor Pidgeon been? He has esca∣ped
the Claws of some Bird of Prey, or some
Weasel.” “It is no matter where he has been,
<HI>said the younger,</HI> but I know where he shall go;
he shall go and bear five others, I have at home,
company, with which I intend to make a Pye for
the <HI>Sovereign Fairy.</HI>” The Prince Pidgeon hearing
her speak thus, instead of going from her, made
towards her, in hopes of being speedily kill'd by
her: but that proved his Safety, for the young Maids
found him so tame and familiar, that they resolved to
bring him up, and keep him alive; to which end
the elder put him in her Work-Basket she had in
her hand, and so they pursued their Walk.</P>
<P>Some days after, one of these Damsels said to
the other, “Methinks our Mistress has a great deal
of business upon her hands, since she is never
from off her fiery Camel, but goes night and day
from one Pole to the other.” “If you can be dis∣creet,
<HI>reply'd the other,</HI> I'll tell you a Secret she
has entrusted me with; the Princess <HI>Constantia,</HI> of
whom she is so very fond, is persecuted by a Gi∣ant
that would marry her, and has put her in a
Tower: and she is doing some surprizing things
to prevent this Marriage.” The Prince listen'd to
this Conversation, and thought till then nothing
could add to his Troubles; but found, to his grief,
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
he was much deceived; for we may judge by his
Passion, and by the unhappy Circumstances he lay
under, of being a Pidgeon, at a time when the
Princess stood in most need of his assistance, that
his Anguish of Soul was great; his Imagination al∣ways
ready to torment him, represented to him,
that <HI>Constantia</HI> was secured in a dismal Tower, and
there exposed to the Importunities and Violences
of a barbarous Giant: And was always in appre∣hension,
lest she, thro Fears, might consent to mar∣ry
him; and then again, lest by refusing she should
hazard her Life, thro the Rage of an unsuccessful
Lover. One day the young Maid, that carried him
in her Basket, having been abroad, and returning
back with her Companion to their Mistress the
Fairy's Palace, found her walking in a shady Walk
of the Garden, went and cast herself at her feet,
and told her, that she had found a Pidgeon that
was so tame and familiar, that her Companion and
she design'd to keep it in their Chamber; that if
she liked it, 'twas at her service, it being very
diverting. The Fairy took the Basket, open'd it,
and seeing the Pidgeon at the bottom, and knowing
who it was, (for that Metamorphosis was owing to
her) fell into a serious and deep Reflection, mora∣lizing
on the Vicissitudes and Changes of this Life,
and above all on those of <HI>Constantio</HI>'s. She caress'd
the Pidgeon, and he, for his part, neglected no
little Artifice to gain her Attention, that she might
give him some Comfort in this melancholy Adven∣ture.
The Fairy carried him into her Closet, and
there said to him, “Prince, the miserable Condi∣tion
you are at this present in, makes me, that I
cannot forbear owning and loving you for my be∣loved
<HI>Constantia</HI>'s sake, who, I can assure you, is
no less indifferent than yourself; blame nobody
but me for this Metamorphosis, I did it to try
your Passion, which is both pure and lasting,
and will tend to your own Honour.” The Pid∣egon
bow'd his Head three times in acknowledg∣ment,
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
and listen'd attentively to what the Fairy told
him.</P>
<P>“The Queen, your Mother, <HI>said she,</HI> had no
sooner receiv'd the Money for the Princess, but
she sent her aboard with all imaginable Vio∣lence;
and the Ship set sail for the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
they were sure to make a considerable Advantage
of the precious Jewel they carried with them.
Her Tears and Intreaties worked not the least ef∣fect
upon them; she said, but all to no purpose,
that the Prince <HI>Corstantio</HI> would purchase her of
them again, if all he had in the World would do
it: The more she urg'd all these Arguments, the
more haste they made to get off, for fear lest the
Prince, hearing of what was done, might come
and snatch away their Prey from them. In short,
after having been some Months at Sea, a great
Storm arose; and the Princess, oppressed with
Grief, and fatigued with the Sea, was at the point
of Death; when they, to preserve her, put into
the first Port they could make: But as they
were disembarking, a great Giant, follow'd by se∣veral
others, came down upon them, and would
see what they had in their Vessel; where the first
Object he fixed his Eyes on, was the young Prin∣cess;
and knowing her again, as well as she knew
him, cry'd out, Ah! little Runaway, the just and
merciful Gods have put thee in my power again:
Do not you remember how I found you, and you
cut my Sack? but I shall be very much mistaken,
if you serve me so any more. And without any
more words, took her away in his Arms from the
whole Ship's Crew, and carried her to his great
Tower, which is situated upon a high Moun∣tain,
and built by Enchanters, who neglected no∣thing
to make it fine and curious. Doors there
are none, and no entring into it, but by the Win∣dows,
which are very high; the Walls are built
with Diamonds, which make it look as bright, as
the Sun at noon-day: In short, it is as noble as Art
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
and Nature can make it. When the Giant had
the charming <HI>Constantia</HI> in his possession, he told
her he would marry her, and make her the
happiest Woman in the World, that she should
be Mistress of all his Treasures, that he would
love her, and doubted not but that she was o∣verjoy'd
that her Good-fortune brought her to
him. She, by her Tears and Complaints, has
let him know the Excess of her Despair; but, as
I manage privately against Fate, which hath swore
the Ruin of <HI>Constantia,</HI> I have inspired the Giant
with such Sentiments of Mildness as he never was
Master of before: Insomuch, that instead of being
enraged against the Princess, he has told her he
will give her a Year's time to consider on it; and
if she does not then come to a Resolution, he'll
marry her against her Will, and then kill her.
After this dismal Declaration, he brought several
young Damsels to bear her company, and divert
her, and set a Guard of Giants round the Tow∣er,
to hinder any Person from coming to her.
In short, the poor Princess seeing no likelihood of
any Succours, and the Year being expired all but
one day, designs to throw herself from off the
top of the Tower. This, Prince, is what she is
reduced to, and the only Remedy I know of, is, for
you to fly to her with a little Ring, which, as soon
as she shall put it on her Finger, will change
her into a Dove, and so you may save yourselves
together.” The Pidgeon was in the utmost im∣patience
to be gone, but wanted the Ring; he
pulled the Fairy by the Apron and Handkerchief,
to make her understand what he meant; which she
knowing full well, said, “Fly, charming Pidgeon,
<HI>giving him the R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng,</HI> take care you lose it not, and
it will guide you to <HI>Constantia.</HI>” But as the Prince
Pidgeon, as I said before, had no Feathers, the
Fairy rubbed him with a wonderful Essence, that
made the most beautiful Feathers grow immediately;
insomuch that he excelled <HI>Venus</HI>'s Doves. Over∣joy'd
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
to see himself replumed again, and taking the
Ring, he arriv'd by break of day at the Tower:
and as there was a spacious Garden on the top of
the Tower, full of Orange-Trees loaded with
Fruit; the Prince, had he not more important Af∣fairs
on his hands, could have spent some time in
admiring it.</P>
<P>He perched upon an Orange-Tree with the Ring
in his Mouth, and in extreme Anguish of Mind;
when the Princess came into the Garden in a long
white Robe, and her Face cover'd with a black
Veil embroidered with Gold, that hung all upon
her Shoulders; the amorons Pidgeon could not have
been certain that it was her, but by the Nobleness
of her Shape, and her majestick Air, which too
plainly discover'd who she was. But when she
came and sat under the Orange-Tree, and lifted up
her Veil, he remain'd sometime dazzled. “My sad
Regret, and melanchoy Thoughts, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> are
now useless, my afflicted Heart has lived a whole
Year betwixt Hope and Fear, but now the fatal
time is come: this Day, some few Hours hence,
I must die or marry the Giant. Alas! is it possible
that the Sovereign Fairy, and the Prince <HI>Constan∣tie,</HI>
should thus abandon me? What have I done?
But what need all these Reflections? I had bet∣ter
execute my noble Design.” Hereupon she
rose up with boldness to throw herself off; but as
the least noise frighted her, and hearing the Pidgeon
stir in the Trees, she lifted up her Eyes to see
what it was; when he taking that Opportunity,
flew upon her Shoulder, and put the Ring in her
Breast. The Princess was surprized at the Caresses
of the Bird, but much more at the Present he made
her; and looking at it some ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, observed myste∣rious
Characters. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came into the
Garden, unheard by her; for some of the Women
that waited on her, had inform'd that dreadful
Lover of the Princess's Despair and that she was
determin'd to kill herself, rather than marry him:
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
and knowing that she went early that Morning
upon the top of the Tower, he dreaded some dis∣mal
Catastrophe; and his Heart, which never,
till then, had been capable of any thing but
Barbarities, was so engaged by the Charms of
that lovely Maid, that he loved her with a Ten∣derness.
But, Oh Heavens! What a Condition was
she in, when she saw him? She was afraid he
would prevent the Means she sought of Death;
and the poor Pidgeon was not a little terrified at
this formidable <HI>Colossus.</HI> However, the Princess, in
the Trouble and Confusion of her Soul, slipt the
Ring on her Finger, and was immediately changed
into a Dove, and flew away with her faithful
Pidgeon.</P>
<P>Never was Surprize equal to that of the Giant's,
who, after having seen his Mistress metamorphosed
into a Dove, and traversing the open Air, remain'd
some time motionless; then he made most dreadful
Outcrys and Howlings, that shaked the neighbour∣ing
Mountains, and with them ended his Life.
The charming Princess flew after her Guide, and
when they had taken a long flight, they lit in a
thick shady Wood, render'd very agreeable by the
Grass and Flowers that grew therein. <HI>Constantia</HI>
knew not that the Pidgeon was her beloved Prince,
and he was grieved that he could not speak, to tell
her; when suddenly, he felt an invisible Hand un∣loose
his Tongue, and said to the Princess; “Charm∣ing
Dove, your Heart has not yet inform'd you,
that you are with a Pidgeon that burns always
with the Flames your bright Eyes first kindled.”
“My Heart, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> has ever wished for this
Happiness, but never durst flatter itself: Alas!
who could imagine it? I was at the very Brink
of Destruction, and you came and snatch'd me out
of the Arms of Death, or from a Monster much
more terrible.” The Prince, overjoy'd to hear
these Words of his Dove, and to find her as tender
as his Desires could wish, said whatever the most
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
delicate and lively Passion could inspire; and told
her all that had happen'd since the sad Moment of
their Separation, particularly the surprizing Adven∣ture
of the Forge, and how he came to the Fairy's
Palace. She was overjoy'd to find that her best
Friend had all along interested herself in her be∣half;
and thereupon said to <HI>Constantio,</HI> “Let us go,
my dear Prince, and thank her for all these Fa∣vours,
perhaps she may restore us to our former
Shapes, and then we will return back to your
Kingdom or mine.” “If you love me with an e∣qual
Flame, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> I have one Proposal to
make, wherein Love is only concern'd: but, love∣ly
Princess, you will say I am extravagant.” “Va∣lue
not the Reputation of your Thoughts be∣fore
the Ease of your Heart, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> speak
without reserve; I shall always take a pleasure
to hear you.” “Then I would advise, <HI>said he,</HI> not
to change our Forms; we may burn, you a Dove,
and I a Pidgeon, with a Passion as ardent as <HI>Con∣stanti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and <HI>Constantia;</HI> and I am persuaded, that be∣ing
free from the Cares of crown'd Heads, we
may live only for each other in this delightful Soli∣tude.”
“Ah! <HI>cry'd the Dove,</HI> How delicate and
great is this Design! For though I am young, I
have undergone so many Misfortunes, since For∣tune,
jealous of my innocent Beauty, has perse∣cuted
me so obstinately, that I shall be overjoy'd
to forsake every thing to live with you. I con∣sent,
my dear Prince, let us pitch upon an agree∣able
Country, and under this Metamorphosis spend
our days, innocent and free from Ambition, and
all Desires, but those of a virtuous Love.” At that
instant <HI>Cupid</HI> descending from Heaven, cry'd out, “I
am your Guide, a Design so full of Tenderness
deserves my Protection.” “And mine too, <HI>said the
Sov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reign Fairy,</HI> who appear'd all on a sudden; I
come to partake in your Joy.” The Pidgeon and
Dove were as much pleased as surprized, and put
themselves under the Care of the Fairy. <HI>Cupid</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
invited them to <HI>Paphos,</HI> where he told them his
Mother was worshipped, and Doves admired; but
<HI>Constantia</HI> told them, they desired to have no com∣merce
with Men but were happy they could enjoy
a pleasant Solitude.</P>
<P>The Fairy struck the Earth with her Wand, and
<HI>Love</HI> touch'd it with his golden Quiver, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣sently
the Wood appear'd, adorn'd with Meadows,
Fountains, and Fruit-Trees: “Stay here, <HI>said</HI> Love,
and swear a lasting Fidelity to each other, in the
Presence of this wonderful Fairy.” Which they
both did. After that, the Fairy promised, if they
would leave that Metamorphosis, she never would
forsake them, but would restore them to their for∣mer
Shapes. They thank'd her, and assured her,
it was not in the least their Desires, since they had
made too much trial of the Misfortunes attend∣ing
human Life. The Fairy apppoved of their de∣spising
the Greatness of the World; and then <HI>Cupid</HI>
and she retired to their Mansions, leaving the
Pidgeon and Dove as Examples of a tender and sin∣cere
Passion: And ever since that time, they have
been represented as true Emblems of Love and
Constancy.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Story was no sooner ended, but <HI>Virginia</HI>
and <HI>Marthonida</HI> clapped their hands, and ap∣plauded
it as a perfect Work. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> desired
them with a modest and composed Countenance to
excuse him; for it was impossible it should be so,
because the haste he made to begin and end it
was almost incredible. “Yes, <HI>said he,</HI> what I tell
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
you is so true, that I have not yet had time to
read it, and find it quite differeut from what I de∣sign'd
it: For example, I could almost have sworn,
the Title had been <HI>Fortunio,</HI> or <HI>The Fortunate Knight;</HI>
and instead thereof, it is of two Sparrows.” “You
mean the <HI>Pidgeon and the Dove, said the Prior, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
him.” Dandinardiere</HI> finding that his me∣mory
had fail'd him, and to make amends by his
Wit, cry'd, he called all feathered Creatures Spar∣rows,
whether Ducks, Geese, or Turkeys; for that
he could not give himself trouble to distinguish
them. “You are very much in the right, Sir, <HI>said
Madam</HI> de St. Thomas, <HI>who was mightily pleased with
the Story;</HI> a Man of Wit, as you are, ought not to
be tyed down to vulgar Rules.” “Oh! Madam,
<HI>continued he,</HI> I always take care to distinguish my∣myself
a little; for if all the World were to speak
alike, and call a Cat, a Cat, and a Dog, a Dog,
where would be the difference between a Man of
Sense and a Blockhead?” “Ah! Sir, <HI>said</HI> Martho∣nida,
how pleased am I at this discovery, where∣in
consist the Beauties of Conversation and good
Patterns, and also to find I have always done
just as you say; for my Mother there can bear me
witness, that when I was but a Child, I would
nor say as every body else did, Nurse, but
Mamma.” “How natural and charming is that▪
<HI>cry'd he,</HI> was you at Court, they would erect Sta∣tues
and Temples to you.” “Fie, Sir, <HI>reply'd Ma∣dam</HI>
St. Thomas, my Daughters are not Heathens,
they love not Temples nor Statues.” “Take it
not so literally, Mother, <HI>said</HI> Virginia, we should
accept of the Temple he speaks of.” Indeed you
are very pleasant, Madam, <HI>answer'd the Baroness,
reddening and swelling;</HI> I warrant you pretend to
instruct and teach me what must be explain'd
literally.” <HI>Marthonida</HI> seeing her Mother angry,
and that there was a likelihood of a Contest be∣tween
her and her Sister, interrupted them, and
told <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> she could not help thinking of
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> or the fortunate Knight, which he thought
was the Title of his Story. “I know not how it
is, <HI>said he,</HI> tis a piece of Fairy Craft, I think; for
I am sure I spoke of <HI>Grugeon, Strong-back,</HI> and—”
“You are mistaken, you did not, <HI>said the Prior, in∣terrupting
him,</HI> for fear <HI>Marthonida</HI> should know
her own Story, and reclaim it: I was entertain∣ing
you with that Story, and you have it now
fresh in your Memory.” The Cit took the Hint,
and the young Lady never penetrated any farther.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Alain</HI> had got wash'd and clean'd,
and coming into the Room with a great Basket of
Books upon his back, and quite out of breath, said,
“My Mother assured me that Wits were as light
as the Wind; but was she alive, I could tell her
otherwise: for these I have on my Shoulders, are
heavier than the Blows of the damn'd Carter that
knock'd me down.” “Hold your tongue, Pol∣troon,
<HI>cry'd the Cit,</HI> it was with shame that I saw
how you was beat; and I was once or twice in
the mind to come and help him, to learn you
whether it is any where writ, that the Valet of
such a Gentleman as I am, ought not to suffer
himself to be knock'd down by such a sorry Fel∣low.”
“Indeed, <HI>said</HI> Alain, <HI>a little chased,</HI> I was in
the wrong to hazard only one Fillip for your In∣terest's
sake. It was all about that Book which
you would have sold to the Church-warden of
our Parish: I believ'd he had stole it, and was
willing to make him return it back again. He
was stronger than me; if I have suffer'd upon this
occasion, it was for you, and in recompence you
quarrel with me. Well, well, I'll—” “Hold your
tongue, impudent Prater, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>as
red as Scarlet,</HI> if these Ladies were not here I'd
pay you what I owe you; but you shall lose no∣thing
of it.” “Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> I would willingly lose
it all, or go away, for I am not so great a Fool
to wait for the Blows of your Care; for by your
leave, I have received too many by half already:
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
and I now protest that I will throw off your Li∣very,
or you shall promise before Witnesses to let
me alone.” <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> lost all Patience to see
<HI>Alain</HI> take the advantage of the ill State his Wound
had reduc'd him to, (tho he had not yet found him∣self
very ill) to make himself so familiar, that he
flew into a violent Passion; and to gain the Esteem
of Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> and her Daughters, and make
amends for the Impertinence of his Valet, he com∣mitted
a greater Crime, by jumping out of Bed, and
running after him. <HI>Alain</HI> knew too well the dan∣ger
he was exposed to, and being used to dodge
about the Room to escape his Master's Rage, he
bethought himself of this Expedient. When <HI>Dandi∣nardiere</HI>
came to him, he stood stock-still, at which
the other was not a little glad, who lifting up his
Fist to give him a good Knock on the Pate, the
other duck'd and threw him on his Nose with such
violence, that his Turban, Gorger, and Gantlets,
which were all he had on but his Shirt, flew about
the Room. <HI>Alain</HI> never stay'd to stand the second
shock, but got away while his Master was getting
up; and had not this Scene been so nigh the Door,
Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> and her Daughters had run away
too, but could not unless they would have step'd over
him: so in the confusion they went and look'd out
of the Window.</P>
<P>When our furious Hero had got to bed again,
the Viscount desired them to go to his Bed-side to
comfort him after this Misfortune; which the Ba∣roness
did not approve of, saying, “What, Monsieur
<HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rginville,</HI> do you think I can submit to such a
thing, after a Person has been failing in the Re∣spect
due to me? I would have you to know, that
all the Women of my Family have always been
very strict in this point, and I'll be burnt before
I will ever derogate from them.” Hereupon she
began to grow very warm, and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who
heard her with all the Perplexity and Uneasiness
imaginable, begg'd of the Prior to make all proper
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
Excuses for his Indiscreetness▪ who, with the assi∣stance
of the two young Ladies, acquitted himself
so well, that the Baroness forgave him, on condi∣tion
he did the same by <HI>Alain.</HI> This last Article in
this Treaty of Peace, was as hard to be agreed to
as the other, for the Cit's Heart was very much set
against his Valet; and the Fall he gave him was
very hard of digestion: but he lov'd <HI>Virginia</HI> so well,
that to see her by his Bed-side again, he promised
her Mother his pardon. As for <HI>Alain,</HI> he was trou∣bled
with Qualms of Conscience, and went and
hid himself under some Trusses of Hay in the Sta∣ble,
where he was just almost stifled when a brother
Valet came to tell him the good News of the Re∣conciliation,
and that he was wanted. He hesita∣ted
some time what to do, and at last sent for the
Baron <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> to advise him whether he should
go, or in short run away; and being assured he
might venture, he went to the Bed's-feet in such a
suppliant Posture, as made all the Company laugh
heartily. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> who pretended to do every
thing with a <HI>Bon-Grace,</HI> made a Compliment to Ma∣dam
<HI>St. Thomas,</HI> and told her she might always
prescribe Laws to him.</P>
<P>To put an end to this Quarrel, <HI>Virginia</HI> said, “I
beg your attention to a Story I'll read in my turn,
and which you may not perhaps dislike, tho it is
very long.” “If it is yours, charming Lady, <HI>said
Dandinardiere,</HI> I am sure you will have the Votes
of all here.” “I shall not tell you, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> whose
it is; but that you may not be prepossess'd in my
favour, I declare it is none of my own.” “Whose
can it be then, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>giving himself
an air of a Man of a great Capacity;</HI> for I must own,
Ladies, I have no Taste but for your Works, and
would go to <HI>Rome</HI> to see any of them.” “You
abound in Flattery, <HI>answer'd</HI> Virginia, and say all
the most obliging things in the World; I must
confess that the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eautiful Turns of Thought,
and noble Expressions, are always flowing on your
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
Tongue. You are never embarass'd but in your
Choice, and that you never make amiss.” “Ah!
my Princess, you assassinate me, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinar∣diere;
your Strokes penetrate too much, and tho
you wound with golden Arrows, you pierce too
deep. I beg quarter, fair <HI>Amazon;</HI> I yield, I am
dead, or very nigh it; but it is the death of Ad∣miration,
or a death of the fullness of my Acknow∣ledgment.
I am—” “Stop there, my Friend, <HI>said
the Baron laughing,</HI> you have both shew'd so much
of your Gentility, that we are charm'd with it;
but the Conversation grows too serious: to make
it more merry, <HI>said the Viscount,</HI> I will propose a
Match to Monsieur <HI>Dandinardiere.</HI>” “I will have,
<HI>said he, bridling his Chin, and making a Mouth that the
whole Company could not refrain laughing at;</HI> I will
have one that is young, beautiful, rich, and of
Quality: but above all, she must be a Woman of
so much Wit, as to be the admiration of this Age
and all Ages to come; for I should have a mortal
aversion to an ordinary Person.” “Well, <HI>said the
Prior,</HI> but pray tell us what you would exchange
against so much Merit?” “I don't much care for
talking, <HI>said he,</HI> but since you will force me to it,
I am not ashamed to tell you, that for Valour and
Birth I will not yield to Don <HI>Japhet</HI> of <HI>Armenia.</HI>”
Here the Baron could not hold out any longer:
“This is a rich comparison, <HI>said he,</HI> I observe he
seldom makes any other.” “Since you are satisfied
on these two Articles, <HI>reply'd▪</HI> Dandinardiere, you
cannot disprove of my Substance; I can make it
appear I have a pretty Income: and for the
Character of my Wit and Person, Modesty pre∣vents
my saying any thing of it.” “'Tis true, <HI>said
the Viscount,</HI> you have Money sufficient; but there's
one fault ruins all, and that is the Interest. A
sordid desire of the Riches of this World, was
never known to be rank'd with Bravery, Quality,
a Delicacy of Thought, and all desirable Quali∣fications;
for that dull<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sullies the Imagina∣tion.”
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
“Yes, Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>somewhat
in a Passion,</HI> I am of opinion, that one should ne∣ver
think of any thing solid, but turn the Pot
upside downwards. Observe the wise Men of this
Age, they know that one and one makes two;
and are not such Fools as to marry without they
get good Fortunes; and I'll do the same, or die
in the Attempt.” “'Tis great pity, Monsieur <HI>Dan∣dinardiere,
cry'd the Baron,</HI> you should lead a single
Life; some pretty little prating Boys, like your∣self,
would be worth their weight of Gold. Think
then of the Love of Virtue, and set not your
Heart so much upon Riches.” “Ha, ha! what you
speak of, <HI>said he, a little chagrin'd,</HI> savours too much
of the Country Gentleman, who prefers an Idea
of Generosity to the thing itself; and I must tell
you, if I meet not with a Person worth as much
as myself I will have nothing to say to Love.”</P>
<P>So frank a Declaration surprized all the Company;
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> laugh'd like a Fool, and clapt his Hands,
and bounced about in the Bed, that he frighted the
Women. “You applaud yourself, <HI>said the Baroness,</HI> for
having a fine Taste.” “Oh, not at all Madam, <HI>said
he,</HI> but for a little that a gallant Man knows the
way of the World, he always takes care of those
false Lights which proceed from the gross Vapours
of the Earth: you understand this Comparison.”
“If we did not, <HI>cry'd</HI> Virginia, we must be void of
Sense.” “For my part, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> I protest I
think nothing can be more perplex'd than your
Discourse.” “You speak that out of Malice or
Envy, <HI>added</HI> Marthonida; for who does not see
that those false Fires are the wanton Inclinations
of the Heart which rise above the middle Region
of the Head, as the others rise above that of the
Air; and that shews Monsieur to be in the right.”
“Yes, without dispute, <HI>reply'd</HI> Virginia; for a sub∣lunary
Reason of Nature is brighter than the
Stars.” The Baron <HI>St. Thomas</HI> sweat to hear these
florid Speeches of his Daughters, which made him
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
shrug up his Shoulders, and look at the Viscount
and the Prior, signifying the pain he was in to see
three People such Fools. The Prior himself, who
was as weary of this silly Discourse, told <HI>Dandinar∣diere,</HI>
he design'd in his turn to propose to him the
most charming Person in the World, but that he
was too difficult; and if the King of <HI>Siam</HI> did not
send him a Princess, or the <HI>Grand Mogol</HI> one of his
Daughters, he should not dance at his Wedding.
“Lay all Jests aside, Mr. Prior, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere;
I might pretend to the best Matches in <HI>France,</HI> if
I made my Quality and Valour known: but yet I
will, notwithstanding my Niceness, hear your
Propositions.” “I assure you, <HI>said</HI> Virginia, <HI>inter∣rupting
them,</HI> you shall talk of nothing till the
Story I have complimented you with, is read.”
“And for my Punishment for having proposed any
thing else, <HI>reply'd the Prior,</HI> I'll read it.” Every
body consented, <HI>Virginia</HI> pull'd a Roll of Paper out
of her Pocket, and the Prior read the following
Story.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of the Princess Fair-Star and
Prince Chery.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a Princess, who having under∣gone
several great Misfortunes, had nothing
left of all her past Grandeur, but two rich Suits of
Clothes; the one of Velvet embroider'd with Pearls,
and the other of Cloth of Gold cover'd over with
Diamonds, which she kept as long as she could;
but the extreme Necessity she was reduced to,
obliged her often to sell a Pearl or Diamond pri∣vately,
to support her Equipage. She was a Wi∣dow,
and had three Daughters, all very handsome:
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
she thought if she brought them up in the Gran∣deur
and State suitable to their Rank, they would
become afterwards more sensible of their Misfor∣tunes.
Thereupon she determin'd to sell that little
she had left, and go and settle in some Country
where they might live cheap; but by the way,
going over a large Forest, she was robb'd of almost
all she had. This poor Princess, after this last
Misfortune, which was greater than all that had
befell her before, knew she must now either earn
her Bread or starve: and as she all her Life-time
had taken great delight in Cookery, and having a
small Kitchen furnish'd with golden Plate, which
she used to divert herself in: that which she used
to do before for her pleasure, she was now forc'd
to undertake for her livelihood. She took a pretty
little House nigh a great City, and made the best
Fricassees and Ragouts imaginable; insomuch that
she had a considerable Trade, and acquir'd great
Fame of being an excellent Cook. In the mean
time her three Daughters grew up, and their Beau∣ty,
without doubt, had reach'd the Ears of the
Court, had not their Mother kept them up in their
Chamber. When one day there came a little old
Woman, who seem'd to be very much tired, and
leaning on a Stick, her Body very feeble, and her
Skin all wrinkled and shrivell'd; “I am come,
<HI>said she,</HI> to make one good Meal before I leave
this World, that I may brag I have had one;
therefore, <HI>said she again to the Princess, drawing her∣self
a Chair to the Fire-side,</HI> get me something nice,
and make haste.” As she had at that time her
Hands fully employ'd, and could not do all herself,
she call'd her three Daughters down, whose Names,
(in relation to the Colours of their Hair, which was
red, brown, and fair) were <HI>Rousetta, Brunetta,</HI> and
<HI>Blondina;</HI> who were dress'd like Country Girls in
Bodice and Petticoats, all of different Colours; but
the youngest was the handsomest and best-natured.
The Princess their Mother order'd one to go take
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
some Pidgeons, another to kill some Pullets, and
the third to make some Paste. In short, two or
three Courses were presently served up, and set
before the old Woman, with clean Linen, good
Wine, and every thing in nice Order, which made
her eat and drink with an extraordinary Appetite.
When she had done, she got up, and said to the
Princess; “Honest Friend, had I any Money I would
pay you; but I have been poor these many Years,
and wanted so kind an Entertainment as you have
given me; all that I can do, is to wish you bet∣ter
Customers than I have been.” The Princess
smiled, and reply'd, “Well, Mother, don't trouble
yourself, I am always well rewarded if I can but
please.” And said <HI>Blondina,</HI> “We are glad it was
in our powers to serve you; if you will sup here
too, you shall be welcome.” “Oh! <HI>cry'd the old
Woman,</HI> how happy are they who have such ge∣nerous
Souls! But don't you think of receiving
some Recompence? Well, <HI>continued she,</HI> assure
yourselves, that the first Wish you make without
thinking of me, shall be compleated.” Then she
went away, leaving them some Reasons to believe
her to be a Fairy.</P>
<P>This Adventure surprized them; they had never
seen a Fairy before, and were frighten'd: insomuch
that for five or six Months after, they could not
forbear talking of her; and whenever they wish'd
for any thing, she was always present in their
Thoughts, so that they came to nothing, which
made them very angry with the Fairy. When one
day the King going a hunting, resolved to call
at their House to see if the Princess was as notable
a Cook as she was represented to him. The three
Sisters were in the Garden gathering Strawberries
when he pass'd by. “Ah! <HI>said</HI> Rousetta, was I so
happy as to marry the Admiral, I boast that I
could spin Thread enough to make Sails for his
whole Navy.” “And I, <HI>said</HI> Brunetta, was my
Fortune so good that I should marry the King's
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
Brother, I could work Lace enough with my
Needle to hang his Palace.” “And I, <HI>said</HI> Blon∣dina,
would the King have me, boast at the end
of nine Months to bring him forth two fine Boys
and a Girl, with Stars in their Foreheads, and a
Chain of Gold about their Necks; from whose
Hair, hanging in curious Rings, should drop va∣luable
Jewels.” One of the King's Favourites o∣verhearing
their Discourse, went and inform'd the
King thereof, who order'd them to come to him.
When they enter'd the Room where the King was,
which they did with all Respect and Modesty, he
asked them, whether what he had been told of
their Discourse about Husbands was true or not?
At which they blush'd, and hung down their Heads;
but upon his pressing them farther, they own'd
it was. “Certainly, <HI>said he,</HI> I know not what Power
influences me, but I will not stir from hence, till
I have married the fair <HI>Blondina.</HI>” “Then, Sir,
<HI>said his Brother,</HI> you will give me leave to marry
the lovely <HI>Brunetta.</HI>” “And I live not without
hopes, <HI>said the Admiral,</HI> but your Majesty will con∣sent
to my Happiness, in espousing <HI>Rousetta,</HI> with
whom I am charmed.” The King, pleased that
two of the greatest Persons in his Dominions should
follow his Example, approved their Choice, and
asked the Mother's Consent; who answer'd, it was
too great an Honour and Happiness for her to re∣fuse:
and then the King, Prince, and Admiral,
kissed her.</P>
<P>Just when the King was going to dinner, a Ta∣ble
came down the Chimney, whereon was seven
golden Dishes of all manner of Rarities, which the
King eat heartily of; the Beaufet was ranged full
of gold Plate, and a fine Symphony plaid all the
time, which made the King imagine it to be a
piece of Witchcraft: when the Princess, guessing
that it was owing to a Fairy, assured him it was
not, and blessed the hour she entertained the little
old Woman. After the Repast was over, which
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
was so long, that Night surprized them all at Ta∣ble;
at which his Majesty was somewhat ashamed,
for it seem'd as if <HI>Bacchus</HI> ruled at this Wedding
more than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pid:</HI> the King pulled a Ring off his
Finger, and put it on <HI>Blondina</HI>'s; and the Prince
and Admiral did the same: after which all the
King's Retinue saluted, as became them, both the
Queen and Princess; but for <HI>Rousetta,</HI> she had not
so much Respect shewn her, for tho she was the
elder Sister, she was the worst married. The King
sent a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber to inform the
Queen his Mother of what had happen'd, and to
send Coaches to fetch the Queen <HI>Blondina</HI> and her
two Sisters. When the Queen-Mother, who was
the most cruel of all Women, knew that the King
and Prince were married so suddenly, and besides,
to two Girls of obscure Birth, she flew into such a
Passion, as frighten'd the whole Court. Then ask∣ing
the Gentleman the Reasons that induced the
King to such a base Marriage, and being told, the
Hopes of having two Boys and a Girl with Stars
on their Foreheads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> she laugh'd disdainfully at
her Son's Credulity, and said all the most invete∣rate
things her Rage could invent. When the
Coaches came, the King invited his Mother-in-law
to go along with them; assuring her, that she
should be look'd upon with all manner of Distinc∣tion.
But she, comparing a Court to the Rolling
of the Waves in a rough Sea, told him she had had
too much Experience of the World, to forsake a
quiet Life. “Why, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> you don't in∣tend
to follow your Business?” “No,” <HI>reply'd she.</HI>
“Then, <HI>added he,</HI> give me leave to appoint you an
Equipage and Attendants.” “I thank you, Sir,
<HI>answer'd she;</HI> when I am alone, I have none to di∣sturb
my Repose, and had I a large Family of Do∣mesticks,
there would not fail of some to incom∣mode
me.” The King admired the Sense and Dis∣cretion
of a Woman, who both thought and spoke
like a Philosopher. But while he was pressing his
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
Mother-in law to go along with him, <HI>Rousetta</HI> went
and hid all the Vessels of Gold that were in the
Beaufet, in the bottom of the Chariot; all which
the Fairy turned into earthen Ware, when she ar∣rived
at Court, and came to put them into her
Closet.</P>
<P>The King and Queen embraced the prudent
Princess with all Tenderness, and assured her she
might command whatever lay in their power; and
leaving this rural Abode, came to Town, preceded
by Trumpets, Hautboys, and Kettle-drums. The
Creatures of the Queen-Mother advised her todis∣guise
her Resentment, lest she should anger the
King, and that might produce fatal Consequences;
she approved thereof, constrained herself, and shew∣ed
a great Friendship for these her two Daughters-in-law,
making them Presents of Jewels, and com∣plimenting
them. The fair Queen, and the Prin∣cess
<HI>Brunetta,</HI> were united by a strict Friendship;
but <HI>Rousetta</HI> hated them mortally for their Good-fortune.
“What, <HI>said she to herself,</HI> must I, who am
the elder, and think myself a thousand times
handsomer than either of them; must I be only
the Wife of an Admiral, who perhaps loves me
not so well as he ought! And shall they be, one a
Queen, and the other a Princess, and be adored
by their Husbands! Ye Gods, it is intolerable!”
And this Envy to her Sisters made her enter into
the Queen-Mother's Measures; for every body
knew, that the Tenderness she shewed her Daugh∣ters-in-law
was all Dissimulation, and that she only
wanted an opportunity of doing them all imagina∣ble
mischief.</P>
<P>The Queen and Princess both proved with Child,
and by Ill-fortune a War happen'd, which obliged
the King to put himself at the Head of his Troops.
The young Queen and the Princess, finding that
they must be left in the power of the Queen-Mo∣ther,
desired they might return home to their own
Mother, which would be some Comfort to them
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
for the loss of their dear Spouses: but the King
could not be brought to consent to it; he conjured
his beloved <HI>Blondina</HI> to stay at her Palace, and as∣sured
her his Mother should use her well. Ac∣cordingly
he desired her, in the most pressing man∣ner,
to love and take care of her Daughter-in-law,
telling her, that therein she would oblige him
most sensibly; and that he hoped for most beauti∣ful
Children, and should long, with the utmost ex∣pectation,
to hear the News. This wicked Queen,
overjoy'd that her Son should entrust her with his
Wife, promised him every thing he desired, and
assured him he might be easy upon that score. The
King, thro his Desire of a quick Return, hazarded
his Troops in all Rencounters; and his Happiness
was, that by his Rashness he succeeded: but before
he could finish the Campaign, the Queen was
brought to bed, as was also the Princess her Sister,
on the same day, of a lovely Boy; but she died in
the Birth. <HI>Rousetta</HI>'s Thoughts were wholly em∣ploy'd
how she might injure the Queen, and when
she saw such charming Children, and that she her∣self
had none, her Rage increased, and she resolved
to speak soon to the Queen-Mother, for there was
no time to lose. “Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> I am so deeply
touch'd with the Honour your Majesty has done
me, by letting me share some part of your E∣steem,
that I willingly would do any thing, tho
against the Interest of my own Family, to obey
you. I am not ignorant of the great Displeasures
you have conceived at the base Marriages of the
King and Prince; and here are four Children
born to perpetuate the Crime: our Mother is but
a poor Country Woman, who had scarcely a Bit
of Bread to put in her Mouth, when she betook
her to be a Cook. Take my Advice, Madam,
let us make a Fricassee of these Brats, and put
them out of the World, before they make you
blush.” “Ah! how much I love thee, my dear
<HI>Rousetta, said the Queen,</HI> for being so equitable,
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
and partaking with me in my just Grief? I had
already determined to execute what you now pro∣pose;
but then, the manner how perplexes me.”
“Never let that trouble you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Rousetta; I
have a little Bitch that has just puppied two little
Dogs and a Bitch, with Stars on their Foreheads,
and Rings about their Necks: we must make the
Queen believe that she has been deliver'd of these
Creatures, and make away with her three Chil∣dren,
and that of the Princess deceased.” This
Project was approved by the inhuman Queen, who
order'd <HI>Feintisa,</HI> one of her Maids of Honour, to
fetch the Whelps, and dress them in as fine Linen
and Laces as the Queen's Children should be, and
put them into the Cradles; then she, follow'd by
<HI>Rousetta,</HI> went and paid the Queen a Visit: “I am
come to wish you joy, <HI>said she,</HI> of the Heirs you
have brought forth to my Son; methinks (holding
up the Whelps) their Heads will become a Crown:
now I am not amazed at the Promise you made
my Son, of bringing two Sons and a Daughter,
with Stars on their Foreheads, and Collars of
Gold about their Necks. Here take them, and
nurse them yourself, for no Women, that I know
of, will ever give their Breasts to them to suck.”</P>
<P>The poor Queen, surprized at the Relation of
this Misfortune, had like to have died away with
Grief; and when she perceived it was true, seeing
the whole Litter lie yelping upon her Bed, cry'd
most bitterly: then clasping her Hands, said, “A∣las!
Madam, add no Reproaches to my Affliction,
which of itself is already too great: Had the
Gods permitted me to die, rather than be the
Mother of such Monsters, I should have thought
myself too happy. Alas! what will become of
me, the King will hate me as much as he loved
me before!” Here her Sighs and Sobbings inter∣rupted
her, and her Speech failed her; when the
Queen-Mother, continuing her Reflections, had the
pleasure of passing away three Hours by her Bed∣side,
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
and then went away. Her Sister, who pre∣tended
to partake of her Grief, told her she was
not the first that had had such Misfortunes; that
she plainly saw it was a trick of the old Fairy's,
who had promised such Wonders; and that as it
might be dangerous for her to see the King, she
advised her to go home to her Mother with her
three Whelps. The Queen return'd no Answer,
but by Tears, which might make the most harden'd
Heart relent, to think she must be forced to suckle
nasty Whelps, and believe herself the Mother of
them. The old Queen ordered <HI>Feintisa</HI> to take the
four Children and strangle them, and after that bu∣ry
them carefully, that she might not be disco∣ver'd:
But just as she was going to execute that
fatal Commission, and had the Cord about their
Necks, she look'd some time earnestly upon them,
and seeing the Stars in their Foreheads, which she
thinking might portend something extraordinary,
she durst not lay criminal hands upon them, but
put them in their Cradle aboard a little Boat, and
with some Jewels committed them to the Mercy
of the Seas. The Boat was soon forced from the
Shore by the Wind, which at that time was very
boisterous, and was got presently out of sight; the
Waves swelled as high as Mountains, the Sun was
darken'd by thick Clouds, and the Air was rent by
violent Claps of Thunder, attended with great
Lightnings: insomuch that <HI>Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntisa</HI> doubted not in
the least but that the Boat was cast away, and
these Infants perish'd; at which she conceived no
small Joy, she having had all along a Dread,
lest something should happen in their favour.</P>
<P>The King, whose Thoughts were always on his
dear Spouse, and the Condition he left her in, ha∣ving
concluded a Truce for some time, returned
with all speed home, and arrived about twelve
Hours after her Delivery. The Queen-Mother met
him, and with a composed Air, full of Grief, held
him a long time in her Arms, wetting his Face
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
with her Tears, and seeming as if her Sorrow pre∣vented
her Speech. The King, all trembling, durst
not ask her what had happen'd, for he doubted
not but it was some very great Misfortune. But
at last, she making as if she used some great Effort
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on herself, told him that his Queen was brought
to bed of three Whelps, which <HI>Feintisa</HI> immediate∣ly
presented to him; and <HI>Rousetta,</HI> falling on her
Knees, begged of him not to put her Sister to
death, but to send her back to her Mother; which,
she said, she should take as a great favour. The
King was so struck and confounded, that he could
hardly breathe, and looking on the Whelps, and
observing, with Surprize, the Star on their Fore∣heads,
and the white Ring about their Necks, he
fell into a Swoon, and rolling a thousand things in
his Imagination, could not resolve on any, till the
Queen-Mother press'd him so much, that he pro∣nounced
his innocent Queen's Banishment: who
was that minute put into a Litter with her Whelps,
and sent to her Mother's, where she arrived almost
for dead.</P>
<P>But Heaven looked with a more favourable eye
on the Boat the three Princes and the Princess
were in; for the Fairy, who protected them, rain'd
Milk into their Mouths, and preserved them in this
sudden and terrible Storm: they floated seven
Nights and Days, and were met out at main Sea
by a Corsair, the Captain of which, seeing the
Stars on their Foreheads, tho at a great distance,
thought the Boat was full of Jewels, which he
found to be true in the end. But what touched
him most, was the Beauty of these four charming
Children, the desire of preserving which, made him
turn back again, to give them to his Wife, who
never had any, and was very desirous of them.
She, for her part, was frighten'd to see him return
so soon, he using to stay out a long time, but was
overjoy'd when he put so valuable a Treasure into
her hands. They both wonder'd at the Star, the
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
Chain of Gold, which could not be taken from o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
their Neck and their fine Hair; but what increa∣sed
it the more, was, when the good Woman came
to comb them, there fell out Diamonds, Rubies,
Emeralds, and Pearls, of several Sizes, some where∣of
were very large and beautiful. The Husband
seeing this, told his Wife he was weary of the
Seas, and that if those Children continued to be∣stow
such Treasures, he would go no more, but
might stay at home, and live as well as the greatest
Captains they had; at which Resolution of her
Husband, the Wife, whose Name was <HI>Corsina,</HI> was
overjoy'd, and grew every day fonder of these
Children. The Princess she call'd <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> the
elder Brother <HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> the second Son <HI>Felix,</HI> and
the Princess's Son <HI>Chery,</HI> who was much more beau∣tiful
than the others, for all he had neither a Star
nor Chain, and was best beloved by <HI>Corsina.</HI> She,
as she could not bring them all up herself without
the assistance of a Nurse, desired her Husband, who
was a great Lover of Hunting, to take some young
Fawns; which he, as they lived nigh a large Fo∣rest,
did accordingly. <HI>Corsina,</HI> when she had them,
exposed them to Windward, and the Hinds smel∣ling
them, came presently to suckle them; when
<HI>Corsina,</HI> in their stead, put the Children, with
whom their Milk agreed very well. Thus twice
every day there came four of them together, to
suckle the Princes and the Princess. In this man∣ner
were they brought up in their Infancy; the
Corsair and his Wife loved them so passionately,
that they were all their Care. He was a Man who
had been well educated, and being a Corsair was
more owing to his Ill-fortune, than any Inclina∣tion:
He married <HI>Corsina</HI> from the Service of a
Princess, where her Genius and Manners had been
happily cultivated; she knew how to live, and tho
it was in a kind of Desart they then inhabited,
where they subsisted upon what they got by rob∣bing
on the Seas, yet she had not forgot the Ways
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
and Manners of the World: They were glad they
were no longer obliged to be exposed to all the
Dangers of the Seas, but were rich enough with∣out;
for every three days she comb'd out of the
Princess's and her two Brothers Hair, a great ma∣ny
considerable Jewels, which <HI>Corsina</HI> sold at the
nighest Town, and bought them therewith all man∣ner
of Necessaries.</P>
<P>After the first Years of their Infancy, the Cor∣sair
apply'd himself seriously to cultivate the na∣tural
Parts, with which Heaven had so largely en∣dow'd
them. And he made no doubt, but that
some great Mysteries were concealed in their Birth,
and his finding them as he did; therefore he re∣solved
to make the Gods an Acknowledgment for
this Present, by his extraordinary Care of their
Education: insomuch that after having enlarged
his House, he hired Masters to instruct them in all
manner of Learning and Qualifications, who were
surprized at the great Genius's of their Pupils. The
Corsair and his Wife never divulged this Adven∣ture;
but the Children pass'd for their own, tho
in all their Actions they plainly shew'd they were
of more illustrious Blood. There was a strict U∣nity
among them, and a natural Politeness; but
the Prince <HI>Chery</HI>'s Sentiments for the Princess <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
were more passionate than the other two: for
when she desired any thing, he was ever most ear∣nest
to obtain it, and was never from her. When
she went a hunting, he would go too; but if she
stay'd at home, he never failed of an Excuse: and
<HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix,</HI> her own Brothers, always
spoke to her with less Respect; all which pass'd not
unobserved by her. As they grew up, their mutual
Tenderness increased, and they lived with all ima∣ginable
Pleasure and Satisfaction. “Dear Brother,
<HI>said</HI> Fair-Star <HI>to him one day,</HI> if my Wishes could
make you happy, you should be one of the greatest
Monarchs upon Earth.” “Alas! Sister, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
envy me not the Blessing I enjoy, in being nigh
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
you; one moment of which time I prefer to all
the Grandeur you can wish me.” If she said the
same things to her other two Brothers, they only
thanked her in a careless manner, and said no
more.</P>
<P>When she was alone, she examined into the Dif∣ferences
of Love, and found her Heart to be some∣what
disposed like theirs; for tho <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and
<HI>Felix</HI> were both dear to her, she could not wish to
live with them all her Life: but for <HI>Chery,</HI> she was
all in Tears at the least thought of his Father's
sending him to Sea, or into the Army. 'Twas th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Love, disguised under the specious Name of an ex∣cellent
Nature, grafted itself into these young
Hearts. But at fourteen Years of Age, <HI>Fair-Star</HI> be∣gan
to reproach herself with not loving her Bro∣thers
all alike, but imagined the Reason proceeded
from the Cares and Caresses of <HI>Chery,</HI> whom she
forbid from endeavouring to endear himself any
more; telling him, that he had found out the way
but too agreeably, and had made too great a diffe∣rence
between them. He, overjoy'd to hear her
speak in this manner, instead of abating his Pas∣sion,
rather permitted it to increase, and every
day evidenced some new piece of Gallantry. They
knew not yet how far their Tenderness might pro∣ceed,
and indeed not the nature of it; till one day,
some new Books being brought to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> the
first she laid her hand on, was a Story of two young
Lovers, whose Passion began when they thought
themselves Brother and Sister; but being known by
their Parents, were married together after a great
many difficulties: And as <HI>Chery</HI> read with great
Justness and a fine Accent, she desired him to read
it to her, while she made an end of a piece of
Lace, which she intended to finish.</P>
<P>It was with no small Concern that he read this
Adventure, especially when he saw so naked a
Description of his own Sentiments; and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
was no less surprized, for it seem'd as if the Author
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad known all that pass'd in her Soul: The more
<HI>Chery</HI> read, the more he was affected; and she, tho
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he endeavour'd all she could, was not able to hin∣der
the Tears from gushing out from her Eyes,
<HI>Chery,</HI> on his part, made useless Endeavours to con∣ceal
his Trouble; he first turn'd pale, and then red,
and faulter'd in his Speech: and thus were they
both in great Agonies. Ah! Sister, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> (look∣ing
“melancholy at her, and letting the Book fall
out of his hands) how happy was <HI>Hippolito,</HI> that he
was not Brother to <HI>Julia?</HI>” “We shall not have
the like Satisfaction, <HI>answer'd she,</HI> tho we deserve
it as much.” The words were no sooner out of
her Mouth, but she knew she had said too much,
and became confused; which was the only thing,
if any there was, that could comfort the Prince.
From that time they both fell into a deep Melan∣choly,
without explaining themselves any farther,
tho both penetrated into what pass'd in each o∣ther's
Soul; and both strove to conceal a Secret
from the World, which they would have been glad
to have been ignorant of themselves. But as it is
natural for us to flatter ourselves, the Princess
pleased herself, that <HI>Chery</HI> had not the Star, nor
Chain of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One day the three Princes being gone a hunting
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> went up into a little dark Closet, which
she loved to sit and think in, the which was sepa∣rated
only by a thin Partition from <HI>Corsina</HI>'s Cham∣ber;
where she heard her (thinking she was gone
a walking) say to the Corsair, “It is now time to
think of marrying <HI>Fair-Star;</HI> if we knew who she
was, we should endeavour to marry her suitable
to her Rank: or if we could believe that these,
who pass for her Brothers, were not so, we might
bestow her on one of them; for where can we find
one more deserving of her?” “When I found them,
<HI>said the Corsair,</HI> I saw nothing that could inform
me of their Birth, but knew by the Jewels that
were fasten'd to their Cradles, that they were no
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
mean Persons; and what is more singular, you
know they seem'd all of an Age, and four are
too many for one Birth.” “I suspected so, <HI>said</HI>
Corsina, that <HI>Chery</HI> is not their Brother, for he
has neither a Star nor Collar.” “That's true, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Husband,</HI> but Jewels fall out of his Hair
as well as the others; yet after all the Riches
we have amassed together by them, I could wish
to know whose they are.” “That we must leave
to the Gods, <HI>said</HI> Corsina, who gave them us, and
when they shall think fit, will let us know.”
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> listen'd attentively to their Discourse, and
could not express her Joy, that she might hope she
was born of illustrious Parents, tho she had never
failed any ways in respect to those she thought to
be hers; and yet was not over well pleased at her
being a Corsair's. But what flatter'd her Imagina∣tion
most, was to think that <HI>Chery</HI> was not her Bro∣ther;
which Thought made her impatient to see
him, to tell him of this extraordinary Adventure.
Hereupon she went and took horse, and followed
them by the Sound of the Horn. <HI>Chery,</HI> as soon as
he saw her, came to meet her before the other
two. “How agreeable a Surprize is this, <HI>Fair-Star,
said he,</HI> to see you a hunting, who are never to be
drawn away from your Musick and other Amuse∣ments?”
“I have so many things to tell you, <HI>re∣ply'd
she,</HI> that I came to seek you, to talk in pri∣vate
with you.” “Alas! Sister, <HI>said he sighing,</HI> what
is it you would have with me to-day, for it is a
long time since you have taken any notice of me?”
At that she blush'd, and cast down her Eyes, and
remain'd some time thoughtful, without ever re∣turning
any Answer. At last, when her two Bro∣thers
came to them, she, like one awaken'd out of
a Lethargy, jump'd from off her Horse, and went,
follow'd by them, to a little Hillock, surrounded
with shady Trees; where she said to them, “Sit
down here, and I will tell you what I have
heard.” And accordingly she told them word for
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
word the Corsair's and his Wife's Discourse, and
how that they were not their Children. Nothing
can be said to express the Surprize of the three
Princes; they debated among themselves what they
had best to do: one was for going without saying
any thing, another was not for going at all, and
the third was for going and acquainting them with
it. The first maintain'd his was the surest way,
because the advantage they made of them would
induce them to keep them; the second said, it was
not proper to leave them, unless they had some∣where
to go, where they might be well received,
for that he could not bear the thoughts of being
called Wanderers; the third alledged the Ingrati∣tude
of leaving them without their Consents; that
it was Folly to stay any longer with them in a
desart part of the World, where they could never
learn who they were, and that therefore the only
way was to tell them of their Design, and get
their Consents. This Opinion at last prevailing,
they all took horse again, and returned home to
the Corsair.</P>
<P><HI>Chery</HI>'s Heart was flatter'd with all that Hope can
offer most agreeable to comfort an afflicted Lover;
his Love made him guess at what was to come:
he no longer looked upon himself as Brother to
<HI>Fair-Star,</HI> and his constrained Passion taking wing a
little, permitted a thousand Ideas that charmed
him. They address'd themselves to the Corsair
and his Wife with a visible Joy, and yet Uneasiness
in their Faces: “We come not, <HI>said</HI> Bright-Sun,
to deny the Friendship, Gratitude, and Respect
we owe you, tho we are inform'd how you found
us on the Sea, and that you are not our Father
and Mother. The Piety with which you saved
us, the noble Education you have given us, and
the Care and Bounty you have shewn, are such
indispensable Ties, that nothing in this World
can free us from. We are come now to renew
our sincere Thanks, and to beg of you to relate
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
to us so rare an Event, and to advise us, that
guided by your wise Counsels, we may have no∣thing
to reproach ourselves withal.” The Corsair
and his Wife were very much surprized, that a
thing, which they had concealed with so much Care,
should be discover'd. “You are too well inform'd,
<HI>said they,</HI> and we can no longer hide from you,
that you are not our Children, and that Fortune
alone put you into our hands. We have no know∣ledge
of your Birth, but by the Jewels that were
found in your Cradles, guess your Parents to be
People of Quality, or very rich. What can we
advise you more? If you consult the Friendship
we have for you, you will, without doubt, stay
here with us, and comfort us in our old Age by
your Presence. If you don't like this House or
Abode, we will remove where you shall think
fit, provided it be not to Court, which a long
Experience has made us disrelish; and will make
you too, if you knew but the continual Trouble
and Care, the Disguises and Dissimulations, the
Envy and Strife, the false Happiness, and all the
Mischiefs attending there: I could tell you more,
but that you may think my Counsels too much
interested; which they really are, my dear Chil∣dren:
we only desire to detain you in this peace∣able
Retreat; yet you are your own Masters, to
go when you will. Consider, now you are in
the Haven, and are going to sail in a boiste∣rous
Sea; the Trouble exceeds the Pleasure: the
Course of Man's Life is limited, and oftentimes
is cut short by one half; the Grandeurs of this
World are like false Stones; the most solid Hap∣piness
is to know how to set Bounds to our De∣sires,
to be wise, and live in a perfect Tranquil∣lity.”</P>
<P>The <HI>Corsair</HI> had not made an end of these his
Remonstrances so soon, but that he was interrupted
by Prince <HI>Felix:</HI> “We have too great a desire, dear
Father, <HI>said he,</HI> to make some Discoveries of our
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
Births, to live buried here in a Desart; the
Morals you have laid down are excellent, and I
wish we were able to follow them: but I know
not what Fatality guides us; let us fulfil our De∣stiny,
we will come and see you again, and give
you an account of our Adventures.” At these
Words the <HI>Corsair</HI> and his Wife burst out in Tears;
the Princes very much relented, and particularly <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
who was of a sweet Disposition, and would
never have thought of going away, had she but
<HI>Chery</HI> to stay with her. After this Resolution, their
Thoughts were wholly bent upon their Equipage
and their Embarkation; for they hoped, when at
Sea, to get some light of what they wanted to
know. They put four Horses aboard; and after
having combed their Heads to give <HI>Corsina</HI> as many
Jewels as possibly they could, they desired her in
exchange to give them the Chains and Diamonds
that she found in their Cradle: who went imme∣diately
and fetch'd them out of her Closet, where
she kept them safe, and tied them all upon <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
whom she embraced with all motherly Affection,
wetting her Face with her Tears.</P>
<P>Never was any Separation more melancholy; the
Corsair and his Wife were ready to die with Grief:
but their Sorrows proceeded not from Interest;
they had already amass'd too much Riches to desire
any more. In short <HI>Bright-Sun, Felix, Chery,</HI> and
<HI>Fair-Star,</HI> went aboard a Vessel which the Corsair
had fitted out with all Magnificence, and fine
Paintings, of the Stories of <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atra</HI> and <HI>Mark An∣thony,</HI>
and all the Attendants of <HI>Venus.</HI> The Course
they steer'd was to the same Degrees of Latitude
where the Corsair found them, and prepared a
great Sacrifice for the Gods and Fairies to obtain
their Protection, and guide them to the place of
their Birth. They took a Turtle-Dove, and were
going to sacrifice it, but that the compassionate
Princess thought it so beautiful, that she saved its
Life, and let it fly, saying, “Go thou pretty Bird
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
of <HI>Venus,</HI> if I should ever want thy assistance, re∣member
what I have done for thee.” Away went
the Bird, and when the Sacrifice was over, there
was heard such a charming Concert of Musick, that
all Nature seem'd to keep a profound silence to
listen to it; the Seas were calm, and the Winds
only breath'd gentle Zephirs, which only disorder'd
the Princess's Veil and Hair: and a Syren arose
out of the Water, and sung, while the Princess and
her Brothers admired her. After some Airs, she
turn'd herself towards them, and said, <HI>Be not uneasy;
let your Vessel drive, before the Wind; and where it stops,
there disembark; and let those who love, love still on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> and <HI>Chery</HI> were sensible of an extraordi∣nary
Joy at these Words of the Syren's; never dis∣puting
but that they related to them; and by Signs
gave each other to understand as much, without
<HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix</HI> perceiving them in the least.
The Ship sailed at the pleasure of the Winds and
Sea; they had nothing extraordinary happen'd in
their Voyage, and the Weather was all the time very
fine, and the Sea calm. They were full three
Months out at Sea, during which time the amorous
Prince had a great deal of Conversation with his
beloved Princess, and one day, among others, said
to her; “How flattering are my Hopes, charming
<HI>Fair-Star!</HI> I am no longer your Brother: this
Heart, which again acknowledges your Power,
and ever shall, was never form'd to be guilty of
such a Crime; for a Crime it would be to love
you as I do, if you was my Sister: but the cha∣ritable
Syren has confirm'd what I always sus∣pected.”
“Ah! Brother, <HI>replied she,</HI> trust not so
much to a thing which is yet so dark that we
cannot penetrate into it. What will become of
us, if we should irritate the Gods against us, by
Sentiments that may not be pleasing to them?
The Syren has explain'd herself so little, that we
must be very fond of guessing at Riddles, to apply
what she said to ourselves.” “Ah, cruel Maid,
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
<HI>said the afflicted Prince,</HI> your Refusal proceeds more
from Aversion to me, than Respect to the Gods.”
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air-Star</HI> made no Reply, but raising her Eyes up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven, fetch'd a deep Sigh, which he explain'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his favour.</P>
<P>The Days were then very long and hot; towards
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Evening the Princess and her Brothers went
upon the Deck, to see the Sun repose himself in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Breast of his beloved <HI>Thetis;</HI> and taking their
Instruments, began a very agreeable Concert. In
the mean time, a fresh Gale of Wind arising, they
soon doubled a Point, which conceal'd from their
Eyes a beautiful City, the Prospect of which ama∣zed
and pleased our lovely Youths so much, that
they wish'd their Vessel might enter the Port; but
doubted lest there should not be room, there be∣ing
so many in before them, that the Masts look'd
like a floating Forest. Their Desires were accom∣plish'd;
the Shores were presently crouded to see
the Magnificence of the Ship, which was no ways
inferior for beauty to that sent by the <HI>Argonauts</HI> to
fetch the golden Fleece. All that saw the Stars on
the Princes, were fill'd with Admiration; and some
ran to inform the King of it; who as he could not
believe it, and as the large great Terrass belonging
to his Palace look'd to the Sea, he came presently
and saw the Princes <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Chery,</HI> taking the
Princess in their Arms, and carrying her ashore;
and after that unshipping their Horses, the Richness
of whose Accoutrements were answerable to the
rest. That <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> was mounted on, was as black
as Jet; <HI>Felix</HI>'s was grey, <HI>Chery</HI>'s as white as Milk,
and the Princess's an <HI>Isabella;</HI> which four Horses
carried themselves so handsomely, and curvetted so
fine, that the King very much admired them.</P>
<P>The Princes hearing the People say, there's the
King, there's the King, lifting up their Eyes, be∣held
in him an Air of so much Majesty, that they
no longer disputed but it was true; and passing by
him, made him each a low Bow, fixing their Eyes
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
on him all the time; while he looking no less ear∣nestly
upon them, was charm'd with the incompa∣rable
Beauty of the Princess, and the good Mein
of the three Princes. He sent the first Gentleman
of his Bed-chamber to offer them his Protection and
whatever they should want, they being perfect
Strangers. They accepted of the Honour the King
did them, with a great deal of Respect and Acknow∣ledgment,
and told him that they only wanted an
House where they might live private, and that
they should be glad if it could be two or three
Miles from the City, because they took great de∣light
in walking. He accordingly did as they
desired, and lodged them and their Train commo∣diously.
The King, whose Thoughts were full of
what he had seen, went immediately into the
Queen Mother's Apartment, and told her what he
had been seeing, and how much he admired the
Youths and the young Lady. At this News she
stood as it were thunder-struck: but recovering her∣self,
ask'd in a careless manner, of what Age they
might be, and he answering about fifteen or six∣teen;
her Uneasiness increased, and she apprehend∣ed
with fear that <HI>Feintisa</HI> had betray'd her: while
the King walked about the Room in some Passion
and Concern, often saying, “How happy must that
Father be, who is blest with such an Off-spring!
and how miserable am I to be a King and Father
to three Whelps, and have no Heirs to my Crown.”</P>
<P>The old Queen heard these Words with a dead∣ly
Dread; the Stars, and the nearness of their Age
with the Princes and their Sister, gave her great
Suspicions that <HI>Feintisa,</HI> instead of making away
with the King's Children, had preserved them: but
as she was a Woman that had a great command
over herself, she discover'd not in the least what
agitated her Soul; and would not send that day to
inform herself of what she desired so much to know;
but the next day sent her Secretary under pretext
of giving some Orders for their Entertainment, to
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
examine and enquire into what was so necessary to
her Repose. The Secretary went early the next
Morning, and arrived just as the Princess was set
down to her Toilet, and was combing her Hair,
which hung down in fine Rings below her Waist,
which was hung round with Baskets to catch the
Jewels she comb'd out; her Star shined so bright
that it dazzled him, and the Chain of Gold about her
Neck, seem'd no less extraordinary than the Dia∣monds,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> rolling down from the top of her Head.
The Secretary could hardly believe his eyes; when
the Princess making choice of a large Pearl, such as
the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> esteem so much by the Name of
<HI>Peregrina,</HI> or the Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grim, as it came from a Tra∣veller,
she desired him to accept of it, that there∣by
he might remember her. He, confounded by so
much Liberality, took his leave of her, and went
to pay his respects to the three Princes, with whom
he stay'd some time to inform himself of what his
Mistress desired so much to know; and after that
return'd back to the Queen, with an account that
confirm'd what she so much fear'd. He told her
<HI>Chery</HI> had no Star, but that Diamonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fell out
of his Hair; and that in his opinion he was the
handsomest: that they were come a great way off;
and that their Father and Mother had prefix'd a
time for them to finish their Travels in.</P>
<P>This Article put the Queen a little to a stand,
and she imagined sometimes that they were not the
King's Children. Thus she waver'd between hope
and fear; when the King hunting one day by their
House, the Gentleman of his Bed-chamber told him
as they past by, that it was there the Princess and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Brothers lived. “The Queen has advised me,
<HI>reply'd the King,</HI> not to see them, fearing lest they
may have come from some Place where the Plague
rages, and may bring some Infection with them.”
“Indeed, <HI>reply'd the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntleman,</HI> it is very dangerous;
but I believe there's more to be fear'd from the
Eyes of this young Stranger, than any Infection
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
of the Air.” “I am of your opinion,” said the
King, and spurring his Horse, went forward; when
presently hearing a Sound of Instruments, he stopt
at the Hall Windows, which were open; and after
having admired the Sweetness of this Symphony,
went on. The noise the Horses made, engag'd the
Princes to look out; who, when they saw the
King, saluted him very respectfully, and made all
haste to come out; and accosting him with a gay
Countenance and much Submission, they embraced
his Knees, and the Princess kiss'd his Hand. The
King caress'd them with a pleasing satisfaction, and
found his Heart so touch'd, that he could not guess
at the cause. He bid them not fail of coming to
Court, telling them he should be very glad to see
them there, and that he would present them to his
Mother. They thank'd him for the Honour he did
them, and assured him, that as soon as their Clothes
and Equipage were got ready, they would make
appearance there. After this the King left them
to pursue his Game, and sent them one half of what
he kill'd, and carried the other with him to the
Queen his Mother; who said to him, “How comes
this about? you used to kill three times as much as
this.” “Indeed, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> I have regaled the
beautiful Strangers with some; and I have so strong
a Fancy for them, that were you not so much
afraid of some Contagion, I would lodge them in
the Palace.”</P>
<P>The old Queen very much vex'd, accused him of
want of Respect to her, and reproach'd him for
exposing himself so rashly; and when he was gone,
sent for <HI>Feintisa</HI> into her Closet, and catching hold
of her Hair with one Hand, and clapping a Poy∣nard
to her Throat with the other, said, “I know
not, base Wretch, what Remains of Kindness
hinders my sacrificing thee to my just Resent∣ment;
thou hast betray'd me, and hast not kill'd
the four Children I put in thy hands for that pur∣pose:
own thy Crime, and perhaps I may forgive,
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
thee,” <HI>Feintisa</HI> half dead with Fear, cast herself
at her Feet, and told her all she had done; that
she thought it impossible that they should be alive,
because there arose just then such a terrible Tem∣pest,
that in all probability they must be cast away,
adding, that if she would but give her time, she
would find out a way to destroy them one after
another, without the least Suspicion. The Queen,
whom nothing but the Promise of their Death could
appease, bid her to lose no time; and indeed <HI>Fein∣tisa,</HI>
who saw her. Life in great danger, neglected
nothing that lay in her power: she watched the
time when the Princes were gone out a hunting,
and carrying a Guittar under her Arm, went and
sat over against the Princess's Window, and sung
these Words:</P>
<LG>
<L>Happy they, the Use who know</L>
<L>Of Blessings the kind Gods bestow;</L>
<L>Beauty fades,</L>
<L>Ages invades,</L>
<L>And blights the fairest Flower:</L>
<L>Too great's the Grief,</L>
<L>When past Relief,</L>
<L>And Charms have lost their Power;</L>
<L>Then to our cost,</L>
<L>We find we've lost,</L>
<L>And miss'd the lucky Hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair-ones, beware, your Charms improve,</L>
<L>While in your Bloom and fit for Love;</L>
<L>Beauty fades,</L>
<L>Ages invades,</L>
<L>And blights the fairest Flower:</L>
<L>Too great's the Grief,</L>
<L>When past Relief,</L>
<L>And Charms have lost their Power;</L>
<L>Then to your cost,</L>
<L>You'll find you've lost,</L>
<L>And miss'd the lucky Hour.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> liking the Words, came into her Balco∣ny
to see who the Person was that sung them, and
<HI>Feintisa</HI> appearing in a Dress suitable to her design,
made her a very low Courtesy. The Princess, as
she was gay, returning the Salute, ask'd her if
those words were made upon herself. “Yes, char∣ming
Lady, they were, <HI>replied</HI> Feintisa; but that
they may never be apply'd to you, I am come to
give you some good advice, which you ought not
to neglect.” “What's that, <HI>said</HI> Fair-Star?” “Let me
come into your Chamber, and I will tell you, <HI>re∣plied
the other.</HI>” “Come up then, <HI>said the Princess?</HI>”
And immediately thereupon, the old Woman rose
up, and came into her Chamber with a courtly
Air, which when once attain'd, is not easily laid
aside. “Dear Lady, <HI>said she, without losing any time,
for she was afraid of being interrupted,</HI> Heaven has
formed you charming and lovely, you are adorn∣ed
with a bright Star upon your Forehead, and
several Wonders are reported of you: but you
want one thing that is essentially necessary; and
if you have it not, I pity you.” “And what is it?”
<HI>reply'd she.</HI> “The Dancing-Water, <HI>added the wicked</HI>
Feintisa, if I had had it in my Youth, you should
not have seen a grey Hair in my Head, nor a
Wrinkle in my Brow. I should have had now
the most charming white Teeth: but alas! it was
too late when I knew this Secret; my Charms
were decay'd before. Profit by my Misfortunes,
dear Child, it will be some comfort to me, for I
have a Tenderness for you.” “But where shall I
get this Dancing-Water? <HI>reply'd</HI> Fair-Star. “In the
<HI>Burning-F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest,</HI> said <HI>Feintisa.</HI> You have three Bro∣thers,
do none of them love you well enough
to go and fetch it for you?” “My Brothers, <HI>said
the Princess,</HI> love me tenderly; and I am sure
there's one of them will refuse me nothing: and
I will certainly, if this Water does what you say,
give you a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecompence suitable to your Deserts.”
The perfidious <HI>Feintisa</HI> retired in haste, overjoy'd
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
that she had succeeded so well, telling <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> she
would be sure to come and see her again.</P>
<P>When the Princes came from hunting, one
brought a Boar, another a Hare, and the third a
Stag, and laid them at their Sister's feet; which
Homage she looked upon with disdain: Her
Thoughts were so much employed on the Advice
<HI>Feintisa</HI> had given, that she seem'd uneasy; and
<HI>Chery,</HI> whose whole Study was to observe her Humour
and Motions, was not long before he observ'd it.
“What is the matter, my dear <HI>Star, said he,</HI> perhaps
you like not the Country where we are; if so,
we will go away immediately; perhaps you are
not pleased with our Equipage, it is not fine e∣nough:
speak, and tell me, that I may have the
pleasure of obeying you first.” “The Confidence
which you give me, <HI>said she,</HI> to tell you what
passes in my Mind, engages me to declare to you,
that I cannot live without the Dancing-Water
which is in the burning Forest; had I that, I need
not fear any thing from the Power of Time.”
“Trouble not yourself, my lovely <HI>Star, added he,</HI>
I will go and fetch it you, or let you know by
my Death, that it is impossible to have it.” “No,
<HI>said she,</HI> I would rather renounce all the Advan∣tages
of Beauty, and be horridly frightful than
hazard a Life so dear. I conjure you never to
think more of this Water; and, if I have any
power over you, I forbid you.” The Prince seem'd
to obey, but as soon as he saw her engaged and
busy, he mounted his white Horse, and furnish'd
his Pockets plentifully with Money; and for Jew∣els
his Head supply'd him sufficiently: He took no
Attendants with him, that he might be more at his
his own liberty; and that if any dangerous Adven∣ture
presented, he might not be troubled with the
Remonstrances of an over-zealous and timorous Ser∣vant.</P>
<P>When Supper-time came, and the Princess saw
not her Brother <HI>Chery,</HI> she was so much troubled,
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
that she could neither eat nor drink, but ordered
the Servants to search every where for him. The
other two Princes, who knew nothing of the Dan∣cing-Water,
told her she was too uneasy, and that
he could not be far off; that she knew he loved Re∣tirement
sometimes, to indulge his Thoughts, and
that without doubt, he was amusing himself in a
little Wood that was hard by. This made her easy,
for some time, but then again she lost all Pa∣tience,
and told her Brothers, crying, that she was
the Cause of his Absence, by expressing a Desire to
have some of the Dancing-Water in the burning
Forest, and that without doubt he was gone thither.
At this news, they resolv'd to send after him, and
she charged the Messengers to tell him, that she
conjured him to come back. In the mean time,
<HI>Feintisa,</HI> who was not without her Spies, to know
the Effect of her Advice, when she learnt that <HI>Chery</HI>
was gone, was overjoy'd; not doubting in the least,
but he would make more haste than those that fol∣low'd
him, and that some Mischief would befall
him. Big with these Hopes, she ran to the Queen-Mother,
to give her an account of all that had past;
telling her, that she no longer disputed, but that
they were the three Princes and their Sister, since
they had Stars on their Foreheads, and golden
Chains about their Necks, and that she had seen
the Princess dressed in the same Diamonds she put
into her Cradle, though they were nothing nigh
so valuable as some that dropped out of her Hair:
Insomuch, that she was assured of their being re∣turn'd,
notwithstanding the care she thought she
had taken to prevent it. “But, Madam, <HI>said she,</HI>
as the only Means left me to repair this Fault
of mine, is to rid you of them, give me but time,
and I will effectually do it: There's one of the
Princes gone already to fetch the Dancing-Water,
who, undoubtedly, will perish in the Attempt;
and I shall form Schemes enough for the rest.”
“We shall see, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> whether the Success
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
answers your Expectation, which is the only
thing that shall skreen you from my just Rage.”
Upon this, <HI>Feintisa</HI> retir'd, not a little alarm'd, de∣vising
with herself how to prosecute her Under∣takings.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of the Prince <HI>Chery</HI>'s Destruction
was one of the most certain, for the Dancing-Water
was not easily to be got; the Reports of the Misfor∣tunes
that attended all those who had gone for it, had
made the Way known almost to every body. The
Prince never spared his white Nag, who went at
an incredible Swiftness, so willing was he to re∣turn
soon to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> to give her all the Satis∣faction
she could promise herself from his Journey.
He was eight Days and Nights without taking any
Repose, but what he got under a Tree in a Wood
or Forest, while his Horse was grazing; and lived
on, what Fruits he found on the Trees. The ninth
Day, he found himself very much incommoded by
the excessive Heat of the Air, and not knowing
what Cause to attribute it to, since he was certain
it was not the Sun, when he gain'd the top of
a Hill, he perceiv'd the burning Forest; where
the Trees were always in Flames, without ever
consuming; which cast such a Heat, that all the
Country about was a dry Desart. In this Forest,
the Prince heard the Hissings of Adders, and the
Roarings of Lions, which very much amazed him;
who could not believe that any thing but a Sala∣mander
could live in a kind of Furnace. After
having considered on so dreadful a thing, and
thought on what was to be done, he gave himself
up for lost; when going nigher to this great Fire,
and being ready to die with Thirst, finding a Foun∣tain,
he alit from off his Horse, and stooping to take
up some Water in a golden Vessel he brought with
him, to carry that the Princess desired in, he per∣ceiv'd
a Turtle drowning, and taking pity on it,
saved it; and after having held it some time by the
Heels, and wiped its wet Feathers, put it in his
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
Bosom, where the poor Turtle recovered. “Prince
<HI>Chery, said it, in a soft tender Voice,</HI> you never could
have obliged any Creature more full of Acknow∣ledgment
than myself: This is not the first time I
have receiv'd most signal Favours from your Fami∣ly;
I am glad that now I can, in return, be ser∣viceable
to you. Think not that I am ignorant of
the Cause of this your Journey, which you have
too rashly undertaken, since it is almost impossible
to tell how many have perished here. The Dan∣cing-Water
is the eighth Wonder of the World;
it beautifies Ladies, makes them young again, and
enriches them; but if I am not your Guide, you
can never get to it: The Source of the Water falls
with so great an Impetuosity into a deep Abyss:
In the Road is a Blockade of Trees, laid so close,
and so entangled by their Branches and Briars,
that I see no Way but to go under Ground. Rest
yourself here, and be not uneasy, I will go and
take proper Measures about it.”</P>
<P>Then the Turtle left him, flying backwards and
forwards, and taking several Flights about; and to∣wards
the Close of the Day, came and told the
Prince all was ready: Who took the loving Bird in
his Hand, kissing it, caress'd it, and thank'd it;
and after that, followed it upon his white Horse.
They had not gone many hundred Yards, before
the Prince seeing a great number of Foxes, Badgers,
Moles, and other Creatures that burrough, and
wondring how they came to be so assembled toge∣ther,
the Turtle told him it was by her means, and
that they came to work for his Service. <HI>Chery,</HI>
when he came to the Mouth of the Vault, pull'd
the Bridle off his Horse's Head, and ty'd it to the
Saddle, and turn'd him loose; and then follow'd
the Turtle, who conducted him to the Fountain,
the falling of whose Water made such a noise, as
would have deafen'd him, had not the Turtle given
him two of her white Feathers. He was strangely
surprized to see the Water dance with so much
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
Justness to the Warblings of some Birds, who fly∣ing
in the Air, formed a Band of Musick. He
fill'd his Vessel of Gold, and pull'd two hearty
Draughts, which made him a thousand times more
beautiful than he was before; and refresh'd him
so much, that he was able to bear the Heat of the
Forest. He return'd the same Way he came, and
finding his Horse again at the Cavern's Mouth,
mounted him again, and taking the Dove in his
Hand, said, “Loving Turtle, I know not by what
Prodigy you have so much Power here, what
you have done for me demands all my Gratitude;
and as Liberty is the greatest of all Blessings, I
give you yours, to shew some token of my Good∣will.”
As he said these Words, he let her go:
She flew away with as sullen an Air, as if he had
kept her against her Will. Upon which he said
to himself, “How fickle art thou! thou hast more
of a Man than a Turtle in thee; the one is in∣constant,
the other not.” To this the Turtle,
mounted high in the Air, said, “And do you
know who I am?”</P>
<P><HI>Chery,</HI> amazed that the Turtle should answer
thus to his Thoughts, suspected her to be something
very extraordinary, and was sorry he had let her
fly, saying to himself, that she might be very use∣ful
to him, and he might have learnt of her several
things, that might have contributed very much to
his Repose. But then again, he considered with
himself, that he ought never to regret a good
Action, and that he was indebted to her, when he
thought on the Difficulties she had smooth'd out
for him, to get the Dancing-Water. His golden
Vessel or Bottle, in which he put it, was so close
stopt up, he could not spill one Drop, nor the Spi∣rit
of the Water evaporate; so that all the way, he
entertain'd himself with the Thoughts, how agree∣ably
he should please his <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> and the Joy she
would resent, to see the Water and him again:
when presently he spy'd several Men on horse-back,
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
galloping at full speed, who no sooner perceiv'd
him, but they gave a Hollow, and pointed to him.
Though his intrepid Soul was so void of Fear, as
not to be alarm'd at any Danger, yet was he vex'd
to think he should be stopt; he spurred on his
Horse, and made boldly towards them: But how
agreeable was his Surprize, to find them to be his
Domesticks, with a Letter from the Princess,
charging him not to expose himself to the Dangers
of the burning Forest! He kissed the Writing, sigh'd
several times, and made all possible haste to ease her
other Fears.</P>
<P>When he came home, he found her sitting under
some Trees, abandon'd to her Grief; but when she
saw him at her feet, she knew now what Reception
to give him; she could both chide him, for going
contrary to her Orders, and thank'd him for his
Present: at last, her Tenderness prevailing, she
embraced her dear Brother, and receiv'd him with
all possible Demonstrations of Joy. The restless
<HI>Feintisa</HI> knew by her Spies, that <HI>Chery</HI> was return<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
and more beautiful than when he went, and that
the Princess, by washing her Face with the Dancing-Water,
was become excessive beautiful, that no bo∣dy
could behold her without Admiration. She
was very much amazed and vex'd, for she made
account that the Prince would perish in the At∣tempt:
But recollecting, this was no time to de∣spond,
but seeking an Opportunity, when the Prin∣cess
went to the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> unaccompanied,
she accosted her with an Air of Friendship, and
said, “I congratulate you, Madam, on the happy
Success of my Advice, your Looks discover too
plainly that you have used the Dancing-Water:
but, if I durst advise you once more, you should
think of getting the Singing-Apple, which is as
great an Imbelishment to the Wit: would you
persuade, it is but smelling; would you appear
in publick, make Verses, write Prose, make Peo∣ple
to laugh or cry, it has all these Virtues; and
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
besides, signs so fine, that it ravishes all that hear
it.” “I will have none of it, <HI>cry'd the Princess,</HI>
my Brother had like to have lost his Life, in
fetching the Dancing-Water, your Counsel is too
dangerous.” What! Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Feintisa,
would you not be the most learned and witty La∣dy
in the World? Sure you don't think so.”
“Alas! What would have become of me, if my
Brother had been brought back dead, or dying?”
“Then let him go no more, <HI>said the old Woman,</HI> let
the other two oblige you in their turns; this
Enterprize is not so dangerous.” “No matter
for that, <HI>said the Princess,</HI> I will not expose them
to it.” “How much I pity you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Feintisa,
to let so advantageous an Opportunity slip you,
but consider upon it: Farewel, Madam.” And
then left her, very much unsatisfied with the Suc∣cess
of her Harangue. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> stay'd at the feet
of <HI>Diana</HI>'s Statue, irresolute what to do: She loved
her Brothers, but so earnestly desired the Signing-Apple,
that she sigh'd and fell a crying. <HI>Bright-Sun</HI>
coming into the Temple, and seeing the Prin∣cess's
Face covered with her Veil, because she was
ashamed to be seen blear-ey'd; but he guessing
she was in Tears, and going up to her, conjured
her instantly to tell him why she cry'd: But she
refused, telling him she could not for shame: and
the more she deny'd, the more earnest he was to
know. At last she said, that the same old Woman
that advis'd her to send for the Dancing-Water had
been telling her of the Singing-Apple, which was
more wonderful; because it created as much Wit
as to make the Person possessed of it a perfect Pro∣digy,
and that she would almost give her Life for
such an Apple, but that she fear'd there was too
much Danger in going for it. “You need not be
afraid of me, <HI>reply'd the Brother,</HI> I assure you, for
I am not so fond as that comes to: What have you
not Wit enough already? Come, come, don't
vex yourself about such a foolish Story.”</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145"/>
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> follow'd him from thence home, not a
little melancholy at the manner of his receiving
the Confidence she reposed in him, and the Impos∣sibility
of her having the Singing-Apple. When
Supper was set upon the Table, she could not eat;
<HI>Chery,</HI> the lovely <HI>Chery,</HI> observed it, and helped her
to the nicest Bits, pressing her to taste thereof: but
all he could say proved useless, the Tears came in
her Eyes, and she rose from the Table. O Hea∣vens!
how uneasy was <HI>Chery,</HI> ignorant of what was
the Cause? when <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> told him, in a sort of
Railery, disobliging enough to his Sister, who was
so much piqued thereat, that she retired to her
Chamber, and would see nobody all that night.</P>
<P>When <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix</HI> were in bed, <HI>Chery</HI>
mounted his white Nag again, and without saying
any thing to any one, set out on his Journey for
the Singing-Apple, tho he knew not one foot of the
way, leaving a Letter behind him, to be given to
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> the next morning; who, when she receiv'd
it, felt all the Disquiet and Torments conceivable
upon such an occasion. She ran into her Brothers
Chamber, to let them partake somewhat of her
Grief; who presently sent after him again, to ob∣lige
him to return, without attempting an Adven∣ture
wherein there was so much hazard. All this
time the King, who never had these four Strangers
out of his Thoughts, as often as he went a hunting,
call'd upon them, and reproach'd them for not
coming to his Court. They excused themselves,
first, that they had not compleated their Equipage;
and then, that their Brother was absent: assuring
him, that upon his Return, they, after the leave
he gave them, would pay their most humble Re∣spects
to him.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Chery,</HI> who was too much urged on
by his Passion, not to make all possible haste, some
time after Day-break, found a handsome young Man
sat under a shady Tree, reading a Book he held
in his hand; to whom he address'd himself in a
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
civil manner, and said, “Give me leave to inter∣rupt
you, to ask if you know where I may find
the Singing-Apple.” The young Man looking up
and smiling, ask'd him if he intended to obtain it.
“Yes, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI> if it is possible, I will.”
“Ah! Sir, <HI>added the Stranger,</HI> you know not all the
Dangers; here is a Book that speaks of them, and
the very reading of it is enough to make one
tremble.” “No matter for that, <HI>said</HI> Chery, the
Danger is not capable of dismaying me; tell me
only where I may find it.” “This Book, <HI>continued
the Man,</HI> says in the Desarts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> that we
may hear it sing eight Leagues off; and that the
Dragon, which guards it, has already devoured
above five hundred thousand People.” “I shall
make one more,” <HI>said the Prince smiling:</HI> And then
taking his leave, set forwards for the Desarts of
<HI>Lybia.</HI> After several days Journey, he listen'd if he
could hear the Apple, afflicting himself with the
length of the way; when perceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the Road
a Turtle almost dead, and seeing no one nigh that
could have wounded it, he believed that it might
belong to <HI>Venus;</HI> and that having escaped her Court,
the little Archer, to try his Bow and Arrows, had
let fly at her: and taking pity on it, lit off his
Horse, took it up, and wiping its bloody Feathers,
took out of his Pocket a little golden Box, of an
admirable Ointment, and no sooner apply'd it to
the Wound of the poor Turtle, but it opened its
Eyes, raised up its Head, stretched out its Wings,
and then looking at the Prince, said, “Good-mor∣row,
<HI>Chery,</HI> you are destined to save my Life, and
I may perhaps do you no less signal Services.
You are come for the Singing-Apple, the Enter∣prize
is difficult, and worthy of you; for it is
guarded by a terrible scaled Dragon, with three
Heads and twelve Feet.” “Ah! my dear Turtle,
<HI>said the Prince,</HI> how overjoy'd am I to see you a∣gain,
and at a time when your Assistance is so
necessary. Don't deny it me, my pretty Creature,
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
for I should die with Grief, if I should return
without the Singing-Apple; and since that I got
the Dancing-Water by thy means, I hope you will
find out some Expedient, whereby I may succeed
as well in this Undertaking.” “Follow me, <HI>an∣swer'd
the Turtle,</HI> and I hope all will be well.”</P>
<P>The Prince let her go, and after following her
all the day, arrived at a great Mountain of Sand,
into which the Turtle told him he must dig;
which he accordingly did, sometimes with his
Hand, and sometimes with his Sword. After some
hours hard working, he found a Headpiece, Breast∣plate,
and, in short, a compleat Suit of Armour for
Man and Horse, all of Glass. “Arm yourself, <HI>said the
Turtle,</HI> and fear not the Dragon; for when he shall
see himself in all these Glasses, he will be so fright∣ned,
thinking his own Resemblance, in so many
Mirrors, to be as many such Monsters as himself,
that he will run away.” <HI>Chery</HI> approving this
Contrivance, armed himself, and taking the Turtle
in his hand, they travelled all that night, and at
Day-break heard a most ravishing Melody; and the
Prince asking what it was, the Turtle told him,
she was persuaded that nothing but the Singing-Ap∣ple
could be so agreeable, for that it perform'd all
Parts in Musick, and seem'd as if all manner of
Instruments were plaid upon, which made them
still keep advancing towards it. The Prince wish'd
to himself, it might sing something that might
be adapted to the Situation of his Heart; and at
that very instant heard these words:
<Q><L>'Tis Love can conquer the most Rebel Heart,</L>
<L>Be amorous still, and from her never part;</L>
<L>And since you follow Beauty's Cruelty,</L>
<L>Love on, pursue, and you will happy be.</L></Q></P>
<P>“Ah! <HI>cry'd he, in answer to these Verses,</HI> how charm∣ing
is this Prediction! I may hope then to be
more happy.” To which the Turtle made no Re∣ply,
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
for she never spoke any thing but what was
absolutely necessary. The farther they advanced,
the more charming the Musick seem'd; and what∣ever
Dread the Prince might be in, he was some∣times
so ravish'd, that he stopt, almost insensible of
any thing else: but the sight of the Dragon, who
appear'd suddenly, soon recover'd him out of this
kind of Lethargy. He had smelt the Prince a great
way off, and expected to devour him, as he had
done by all the rest. He came jumping along, co∣vering
the Ground as he came with a poisonous
Froth. Out of his infernal Throat there issued
Fire and little Dragons, which he used instead of
Darts, to throw into the Eyes and Ears of all the
Knights-Errant that came to fetch away the Sing∣ing-Apple.
But when he saw his own terrible Fi∣gure,
multiplied a thousand times, in the Prince's
Glass Armour, he stopt; and looking hard upon
him, bearing so many no less horrid Monsters than
himself about him, was frighten'd, and run away.
<HI>Chery</HI> perceiving the happy Success of his Armour,
pursued him to the Mouth of a deep Cavern, which
he closed up, to prevent his returning again. After
that, searching about, he discover'd, with Admira∣tion,
the beautiful Tree, which was all Amber, ex∣cept
the Apples, which were Topazes; but that
which he sought after with so much pains, and
great danger, was a Ruby crown'd with a Diamond.
The Prince, transported with the Joy of having it
in his power to bestow so great a Treasure on his
beloved <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> made haste to break off the
Bough; and proud of his Good-fortune, mounted
his Horse again, but saw no more of the Turtle,
who, when there was no farther need of her assist∣ance,
was flown away. In short, the Prince returned
to his Princess with his Prize, who had never en∣joy'd
one moment's Repose since his Absence; she
continually reproached herself for her Ambition
of Wit, dreading <HI>Chery</HI>'s Death far more than her
own: “Ah unhappy Wretch that I am (<HI>would she of∣ten
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
cry, fetching deep and heavy Sighs</HI>) why was I so
vain-glorious? Why could not I be content to
speak, and do things well enough not to be im∣pertinent?
Well, I am punished for my Pride,
if I lose him I so dearly loved. Alas! Perhaps
the Gods, displeased with the irresistless Passion I
have for <HI>Chery,</HI> will deprive me of him by some
tragical end.” No afflicting tormenting Thought
escaped her Imagination, when, in the middle of
the Night, she heard such ravishing Musick, that
she could not lie in Bed, but got up, and went
to the Window to hear it more plainly, not know∣ing
what to think of it: Sometimes she believed it
to be <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Muses, sometimes <HI>Venus,</HI> the
<HI>Graces,</HI> and <HI>Loves;</HI> and all the time the Symphony
seemed to come nigher. At last, it being Moon∣light,
she discovered the Prince; upon which she
retired, seeing a Gentleman, and not knowing
who it might be: when he stopt under her Win∣dow,
and the <HI>Apple</HI> sung an Air, the beginning of
which words were, or something like it, <HI>Awake,
you sleeping Fair.</HI></P>
<P>At this the curious Princess presently looked out,
and knowing her Brother again, was ready to jump
out of the Window to him. She talked so loud,
that the whole Family was presently alarmed, and
came and opened the Doors; which <HI>Chery</HI> entered
with all imaginable haste, holding in his hand a
Branch of Amber, with the wonderful Fruit upon
it: and as he had smelt on it often, his Wit was
so much increased, that nothing was comparable
to it. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> ran to meet him with great preci∣pitation,
crying with Joy, and saying, “Do you
believe I thank you, dear Brother? No, there's
nothing that I do not buy too dear, when I ex∣pose
you to fetch it.” “And there are no Dan∣gers
I would not hazard, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> to give
you the least Satisfaction. Accept, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> of
this Fruit, none deserves it so much as you.”
<HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> and his Brother, came just then, and
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
interrupted their Conversation, and were glad to
see their Brother again, who gave them an Ac∣count
of his Journey, which lasted till Morning.</P>
<P>The wicked <HI>Feintisa</HI> having left the Queen, af∣ter
having acquainted her with her Projects, was
just retired home, and got to Bed, but could not
sleep, thro her Uneasiness, one Wink. When she
heard the sweet singing of the <HI>Apple,</HI> and not
doubting but that he had obtained it, she cried and
bewailed her Condition, scratching her Face, and
tearing off her Hair. Her Grief was extremely
great; for instead of doing the Princes the mis∣chief
she projected, she did them all the Service
imaginable. As soon as it was day, she was too
well informed of the Prince's Return, and upon
that hurried away to the Queen-Mother: “Well,
<HI>Feintisa, said that Princess,</HI> do you bring me any
good News, are they destroyed?” “No, Madam,
<HI>reply'd she,</HI> casting herself at her feet: but let not
your Majesty be impatient; I have a thousand
ways yet left.” “Ah Wretch! <HI>said the Queen,</HI> thou
intendest to betray me, and therefore spare them?”
<HI>Feintisa</HI> protested to the contrary, and when she
had appeased her, returned home, to think of what
was to be done next. She let some days pass
without undertaking any thing: when being in∣formed
by her Scouts, that the Princess was walk∣ing
in the Forest alone, expecting her Brothers, she
went thither; and addressing herself to her, said,
“Charming <HI>Star,</HI> I have been informed that you
have got the Singing-Apple, and was overjoyed to
hear of it; for I have so great an Inclination
for you, that I am interested in whatever tends
to your advantage. And, <HI>continued she,</HI> I can∣not
forbear advising you to one thing more.” “Ah,
<HI>cry'd the Princess, getting from her,</HI> keep your Ad∣vice
to yourself, for tho the Benefits I receive be
great, yet they make not amends for the Trouble
and Uneasiness they have caused me.” “Uneasiness
is not so great an Evil (<HI>answer'd she with a Smile</HI>)
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
there is a Sweetness and Tenderness sometimes in
it.” “Forbear, <HI>said</HI> Fair-Star, I tremble when I think
on it.” “Indeed, <HI>said the old Woman,</HI> you are very
much to be pitied, to be the most beautiful and
wittiest Lady in the World.” “I desire once
more, <HI>reply'd the Princess,</HI> to be excused, I know
too well the Condition the Absence of my Bro∣ther
reduced me too.” “You must notwithstand∣ing
be told, <HI>said</HI> Feintisa, that you want the
little <HI>Green-Bird,</HI> that tells every thing, by which
you will be informed of your Birth, and your
good and ill Fortune, there's no particular thing
he does not discover; and when the World shall
say, that <HI>Fair-Star</HI> has the Dancing-Water and the
Singing-Apple, and wants the little Green-Bird,
they had as good say nothing.”</P>
<P>After having, in this manner, utter'd what she
intended, she retired, leaving the Princess melan∣choly
and thoughtful, and sighing, as if there was
something she desired: “This Woman is in the
right, <HI>said she;</HI> what am I the better for the
Dancing-Water and Singing-Apple, if I know not
who I am, who are my Parents, and by what
Farality my Brothers and I were exposed to the
Fury of the Waves? There must be something
extraordinary in our Births, that we should be
abandon'd in the manner we were, and receive
so evident a Protection from Heaven. How great
a pleasure would it be to me to know my Father
and Mother, to love them if they be alive, and
to honour their Memory if dead.” Thereupon
Tears trickled down her Cheeks, clear as Drops of
Morning-Dew, distilling upon Lillies and Roses.
<HI>Chery,</HI> who was always more impatient to see her
again than the other two, made the most haste, af∣ter
the Sport was over, to return home: that day
he was a-foot, his Bow hung negligently by his
side, some Arrows he held in his hand, and his
Hair was tied with a Ribband behind him; and in
this warlike Dress he looked charmingly pleasing.
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
When the Princess saw him, she retired to a dark
shady Walk, that he might not perceive those Cha∣racters
of Grief in her Face: but nothing can
escape a Lover's Eye; for the Prince looking upon
her, soon knew something was the matter. Where∣upon
he was disturbed, and desired her to tell him
what it was; but she refusing with Obstinacy, he
turn'd one of his Arrows against his Breast, and said,
“Since you love me not, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> I have nought
to do but die.” By this means he (as I may say)
extorted the Secret from her; but on these Condi∣tions,
that he should not with the hazard of his
Life seck to satisfy her Desires: all which he pro∣mised.
But as soon as she was retired to her Cham∣ber,
and her Brothers to theirs, he went into the
Stable again, and mounting his Horse, set out with∣out
saying a word to any one. When it was known
the next Morning, the whole Family was in the
utmost Consternation. The King, who could not
forget, sent to invite them again, and they return'd
the same Excuse again of their Brother's being
absent, and that they could have no Pleasure and
Satisfaction without him; but that upon his return
they would not fail to pay their Devoirs. The Prin∣cess
was inconsolable; the Water and Apple could
not charm her, nothing was agreeable without
<HI>Chery.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince wander'd up and down, asking all he
met where he might find the little Green-Bird; but
no body could tell him, till he lit on an old Man,
who taking him home with him, took the pains
to look over his Books and a Globe, which he
had made the Study of his Life; and then told
him it was in a frozen Climate, on the point of a
frightful Rock, shewing him all the Roads to it.
The Prince, by way of return, presented him with
a Purse of Jewels he had comb'd out of his Hair;
and taking leave of him, pursued his Journey. To
be short, one Morning by Sun-Rise, he perceiv'd
the Rock, which was very high and craggy, and
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
on the top of it the Bird talking like an Oracle,
telling most strange things. He thought he might
catch it with little trouble, since it appear'd to be
very tame, hopping from one place to another.
He lit off of his Horse, and climb'd up without
making any noise, promising himself and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
the most sensible Pleasure; when, all on a sudden,
the Rock open'd, and he fell, as motionless as any
Statue, into a large Hall; so that he could neither
bemoan nor complain of his deplorable Adventure.
There he found three hundred Knights, who ha∣ving
made the same Attempt as himself, were in
the same Condition, being only able to look at one
another.</P>
<P>The time of his Absence seem'd so long to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
that she fell extraordinary ill; and the Physi∣cians
pronounced her to be devour'd by deep Me∣lancholy.
Her Brothers, who loved her tenderly,
would often tel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her the cause of her Illness; upon
which she confess'd, that she reproach'd herself
Night and Day for <HI>Chery</HI>'s Departure; and that she
was sure she should die if she heard no News of
him. <HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> moved by her Tears, resolved to
go and seek his Brother; and accordingly, knowing
where the Bird was, set out, approach'd it with
the same hopes, was swallowed up by the Rock,
and fell into the great Hall, where the first Ob∣ject
he fix'd his eyes on was <HI>Chery;</HI> but could
not speak to him. In the mean time <HI>Fair-Star</HI> grew
better, hoping every Minute to see her two Bro∣thers
return; but being deceived therein, her Grief
renew'd, and she complain'd incessantly, accusing
herself for the Disasters that befel her Brothers:
when Prince <HI>Felix,</HI> having no less Compassion on
her, and Concern for his Brothers, resolved to go
and find them; and acquainted her therewith.
She at first seem'd to oppose it; but he reply'd, that
it was just that he should expose himself for those
who were so dear to him; and then set out, after
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
taking his leave of the Princess, whom he left a
Prey to the most piercing Grief.</P>
<P>When <HI>Feintisa</HI> knew that the third Prince was
gone, her Joy had no end, but away she ran to
the Queen, and promised her with more assurance
than ever, to destroy this unfortunate Family. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lix</HI>
fared the same with <HI>Chery</HI> and <HI>Bright-Sun;</HI> he
found the Rock, saw the Bird, and fell in the Hall,
where he knew the Princes he sought, and saw
them ranged in Niches. They never slept, nor eat,
but remain'd in that sad condition, having only
their Thoughts at liberty. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> seeing none of
her Brothers return, was inconsolable, and reproach∣ed
herself for staying so long after them; and with∣out
any longer hesitation order'd their Servants
to stay six Months; and if neither she nor her
Brothers return'd in that time, to go and acquaint
the Corsair and his Wife with their Deaths. Then
dressing herself in Men's Clothes, as most fitting to
secure her from all Insults in her Journey, <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>intisa</HI>
had the pleasure to see her go upon her Isabella
Horse; and immediately after ran full of Joy to the
Palace to regale the Queen with the News. She
only arm'd herself with an Head-piece, the Visor
of which she never lifted up, because her Beauty
was so perfect, she would not otherwise have past
for a Man. She suffer'd very much by the Rigour
of the Weather; for that Country where the Green-Bird
lived, in no Season ever received the happy
Influence of the Sun: but Cold, nor nothing could
dismay her. In her way she saw a Turtle no less
white nor cold than the Snow it lay upon, which,
notwithstanding her Impatience of arriving at the
Rock, she could not see perish; but lighting off
her Horse, took it up, warmed it with her Breath,
and put it into her Bosom, where it never stirr'd.
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> thinking it dead, pulled it out, and look∣ing
sorrowfully upon it, said, “What shall I do,
lovely Turtle, to save thy Life?” To which the
little Creature made answer, “One sweet Kiss, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
from your Mouth, will finish what you
have so charitably begun.” “Not only one, <HI>said
the Princess,</HI> but a thousand if need be:” and fell a
kissing it. Upon which the Dove reviving, reply'd,
“I know you, notwithstanding your Disguise, and
must tell you, that you undertake a thing which
will be impossible for you to effect without my
Assistance; but do as I advise you. When you
come to the Rock, instead of attempting to climb
it, stay at the bottom, and sing the most melodi∣ous
Song you can think of; the Green-Bird will
hear you, and observe from whence the Voice
comes; then you must pretend to be asleep, and
I will stay by you: when he sees me, he'll come
from the Rock to peck me, and then you must
take your advantage and catch him.”</P>
<P>The Princess, overjoy'd at this Hope, arrived soon
at the Rock, where she found her Brothers Horses
grazing, which sight renew'd all her Grief, and
she sat down and cry'd bitterly; but the little
Green-Bird said such fine and comfortable things to
those that were afflicted, that she dried up her
Tears, and sung so loud and charming, that the
Princes in the Hall had the pleasure of hearing her,
which was the first Moment they began to hope.
The little Green-Bird heard her also, and look'd
to see from whence the Voice came, and percei∣ving
the Princess, who had pulled off her Cask, that
she might lie down to sleep with more ease, as also
the Turtle hopping by her; he came down to peck
her, but had not pull'd off three Feathers before he
was taken himself. “Ah! <HI>said he,</HI> what would you
have with me? What have I done to engage you
to come so far to make me miserable? Give me
my liberty, I conjure you, and I will do what∣ever
you desire in exchange.” “Restore me my
Brothers, <HI>said</HI> Fair-Star, whom by their Hor∣ses
feeding here, I know thou detainest some∣where
hereabouts.” “I have a red Feather, <HI>said
he,</HI> under my left Wing, pull it out, and touch
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
the Rock with it.” The Princess made haste to
do what he had bid her, but at the same time saw
such Flashes of Lightning, and heard such Claps of
Thunder, together with the roaring of the Wind,
that she was very much frighten'd; but notwith∣standing
held the Green-Bird fast, that he might not
escape her: then touch'd the Rock again a second
and third time, at which last it split from the Top
to the Bottom, and she with an Air of Victory en∣ter'd
the Hall, where the three were with a great
many others. She ran to <HI>Chery,</HI> who knew her not
in that Dress, and in a Helmet; for then the En∣chantment
was not destroy'd, insomuch that he
could neither speak nor stir. The Princess seeing
that, asked the Bird more Questions, to which he
made answer, that she must rub the Eyes of all
those she would free from the Enchantment, with
the same red Feather; which good Office she did
to several Kings and Princes, as well as her three
Brothers: who, in return for so great a Benefit, fell
down on their Knees, and call'd her the Deliverer
of Kings.</P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> then perceiving that her Brothers, de∣ceived
by her Dress, did not know her, pull'd off
her Helmet, and holding out her Arms, embraced
them a thousand times, if possible, and afterwards
ask'd the other Princes civilly who they were;
every one told his own particular Adventure, and
offer'd to accompany her wherever she went: to
which she answer'd, That tho the Laws of Knight∣hood
might give her some Right over their Liber∣ty,
she waved it, leaving them to pursue their own
Pleasures; and then retired with her Brothers, that
they might give each other a particular account of
what had befel them since their Separation. The
little Green-Bird often interrupted them, to desire
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> to give him his Liberty; upon which she
look'd for the Dove to ask her opinion: but not
finding her, told the Bird he had cost her too much
Trouble and Uneasiness to enjoy so little of her
<PB N="159" REF="157"/>
Conquest. Thereupon they all four mounted their
own Horses, leaving the other Kings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to go
a-foot, their Equipage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being all lost and dead,
during the many Years of their Enchantment.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother, eased of all the Disquiet
with which the Return of the Princes and Princess
had burden'd her, renewed her Instances to the
King to marry again; and importun'd him so much,
that he made choice of a Princess, one of his Rela∣tions.
But as he must first disannul his Marriage
with the Queen <HI>Blondina,</HI> who had lived all that
time at her Mother's with the three Whelps; the
old Queen sent a Coach for her and them. She
came according to her Commands, and was dress'd
in black, with a long Veil that reach'd down to her
Feet; in which Apparel she appear'd as beautiful as
the Morning-Star: tho she was become lean and
pale by not sleeping nor eating but just to sustain
Nature, and out of Complaisance to her Mother,
who was pitied by all. The King relented so much,
that he durst not cast his eyes on her; for he con∣sented
to this second Match purely out of the hopes
of Heirs. The Marriage-Day being appointed, the
old Queen, urged thereto by <HI>Rousetta,</HI> who always
hated her unfortunate Sister, would have the Queen
<HI>Blondina</HI> appear at the Feast, which was to be very
magnificent: and the King to shew his Grandeur
to Strangers, sent the first Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber
to the Princes and their Sister, to invite
them to it.</P>
<P>The Gentleman went accordingly, and knowing
the extreme Desire the King had to see them, find∣ing
them not at home, left one of his Attendants
to wait for them, and to bring them without any
delay. The Night before this Banquet, <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
and the three Princes arrived, to whom the Person
that was left deliver'd his Message, telling them
withal the History of the King's Life; how that he
had married a young beautiful Damsel, who had
the Misfortune to be deliver'd of three Whelps;
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
and that upon that account he had put her away,
tho he loved her tenderly: that he had lived fifteen
Years before he would hearken to any Proposals of
Marriage; but being press'd thereto by the Queen-Mother
and his Ministers of State, he had deter∣mined
to espouse a young Princess of his Court, to
whose Nuptials they were invited.</P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> dress'd herself in a Rose-colour'd Velvet,
bedeck'd on the Robings with Diamonds▪ her Hair
hanging on her Shoulders in fine Curls, but tied
together with a Bunch of Ribbons, by which means
the Gold-Chain on her Neck appear'd more visible;
the Star on her Forehead shined with all imagina∣ble
Lustre; and in short, she seem'd too beautiful
for a Mortal. Her Brothers came not far short of
her; and Prince <HI>Chery</HI> had something that distin∣guish'd
him most advantageously. They went all
four into an Ivory and Ebony Chariot, drawn by
twelve white Horses, their Equipage every way
suitable. The King, overjoy'd to see them, recei∣ved
them at the Stair-head; the Apple sung won∣derfully
fine, the Water danced, and the Green-Bird
talk'd like an Oracle. They all fell on their
Knees, till the King raised them up with his Hand,
which they kiss'd with all Respect and Affection.
After that he embraced them, and said, “I am
obliged to you, lovely Strangers, for your Com∣pany
to-day; your Presence gives me a sensible
Pleasure.” Then he led them into a large Hall,
where there were several Tables set out with all
manner of Rarities and Dainties, and Musick play∣ing
all the time. Soon after came the Queen-Mo∣ther
with her new Daughter-in-law that was to be,
accompanied by <HI>Rousetta,</HI> and a great number of
Ladies, and with them the poor Queen led by a
Brass-Chain about her Neck, to which the three
Dogs were fasten'd; who, together with them, was
carried to a great Bowl of Bones and Offal-Meat,
that was set out by the old Queen's Command in
one part of the Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159"/>
When <HI>Fair-Star</HI> and the Princes saw this unhap∣py
Princess, Tears came in their Eyes; either be∣cause
they were sensibly touch'd with the Vicissi∣tudes
and Changes of this World, or by Instinct of
Nature. But how outrageous were the old Queen's
Thoughts at so unexpected a Return, so contrary to
her Designs? She cast so furious a Look at <HI>Fein∣tisa,</HI>
that she wish'd the Earth would open, and
swallow her up; so much did she dread her. The
King presented the Princess and her Brothers to
his Mother, saying the most obliging things of them;
and she, notwithstanding her inward Hatred and
Concern, receiv'd them with a favourable Compli∣ment,
and a Smile; for at that time Dissimulation
was as much in vogue as now. No Mirth was
wanting during the Feast, tho the King was not
very well pleased to see his Wife eat with Dogs, as
the meanest of all Creatures; but having resolved
to shew all manner of Complaisance to his Mother,
she order'd every thing as she thought fit.</P>
<P>When the Repast was over, the King addressing
himself to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> said, “I hear you are possess'd
of three incomparable Things, I wish you joy of
them, and desire you to tell me how you got
them.” “Sir, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> I shall obey you with
pleasure. I was told that the Dancing-Water
would make me handsome, and the Singing-Apple
inspire those who had it with Wit; which were
the two Reasons made me desirous of them. For
the little Green-Bird, who tells every thing, our
ignorance of our fatal Births made me cove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him,
since we were Children aba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don'd by our Parents.”
“To judge of your Birth by your Persons, <HI>reply'd
the King,</HI> it must be illustrious; but tell me sin∣cerely
who you are.” “Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> my Brothers
and self deferr'd that Enquiry till our Return,
and then we receiv'd the Honour of an Invitation
to your Wedding, and have brought these Rari∣ties
to divert you.” “I am very glad of it, <HI>said the
King,</HI> therefore let us not defer so agreeable an
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
Entertainment.” “What, <HI>said the Queen-Mother, in
a Passion,</HI> can you amuse yourself no better than
with such idle Stories, and such silly Chits and
their Rarities; I am sorry your Credulity should
be so much abused, and that they should have
the Honour to sit at my Table.” <HI>Fair-Star</HI> and her
Brothers knew not how to behave themselves at
this disobliging Expression, but were confused and
vex'd to be affronted before so much Company:
but the King telling his Mother that this Proceed∣ing
of hers very much displeased him, desir'd them
to take no notice of it, and held out his Hand as a
Sign of his Friendship. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> call'd for a Glass-Bason,
and pouring the Dancing-Water into it;
which, by its skipping and jumping, sometimes
forming Waves like a rolling Sea, and sometimes
changing its Colour, fill'd all the Company with
Admiration, by its forcing the Bason along the
Table to the King, cast out some Drops into the
first Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber's Face;
who being a Man of good Mein, but of a disagree∣able
Face, (tho' a Man of Merit) having but one
Eye, the Water made him very beautiful, and re∣stored
his Eye again. The King, whose Favourite
he was, seem'd as much pleased with this Adven∣ture,
as the Queen-Mother was vex'd to hear the
Applauses of the whole Company. After that <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
produced the Ruby Apple upon its Branch of
Amber, which began as melodious a Concert, as if
there had been a hundred Musicians; which ra∣vished
the Senses of the King and whole Court,
whose Admiration increased when she shew'd the
little Green-Bird in a golden Cage, out of which she
took him gently, and set him upon the Apple, which
out of Respect left off singing, to give him time to
speak: his Feathers were so bright, that when the
Eyes were shut, they glisten'd, and were of all man∣ner
of Shades of Green He address'd himself to the
King, and ask'd him what he pleased to know.
“We want to be inform'd, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> who
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
this Lady and three Gentlemen are.” “O King,
<HI>answer'd the Bird, with a plain and intelligible Voice,</HI>
she is thy own Daughter, and two of these Prin∣ces
are thy Sons; the third, whose Name is <HI>Chery,</HI>
is thy Nephew.” Thereupon, with an unparal∣lell'd
Eloquence, he told the whole Story, without
omitting the east Circumstance.</P>
<P>The King melted into Tears, and the afflicted
Queen leaving her Dogs, came softly forwards, cry∣ing
for Joy; for she no longer disputed the Truth
of the Story, when she saw all the Tokens. The
three Princes rose up at the end thereof, cast them∣selves
at the King's feet, embraced his Knees, and
kissed his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and: He, with open Arms, clapt them
to his Heart; and, at that time, there was nothing
heard, but Sighs and Cries of Joy. When at last,
the King seeing his Queen standing fearful by the
Wall-side in an humble Posture, ran to her, and
embraced her a thousand times: then took her by
the hand, and made her sit down by him; but not
before her Children and she had embraced as
often. Never was Sight more tender and moving
they were all in Tears, lifting up their Hands and
Eyes to Heaven to return thanks. The King made
the Princess he was to marry a Compliment, and
withal, a Present of Jewels. But for the Queen-Mother,
<HI>Rousetta,</HI> and <HI>Feintisa,</HI> they could expect
nothing but the utmost Resentment. The Thunder
of his Anger began to grumble, when the generous
Queen, her Children, and <HI>Chery,</HI> conjured him not
to put himself into a Passion, but to pass a more
exemplary than severe Sentence. The Queen-Mo∣ther
he made a close Prisoner for Life in a strong
Castle, and <HI>Rousetta</HI> and <HI>Feintisa</HI> were cast into a
deep nasty Dungeon, there to remain all their days
with the three Dogs.</P>
<P>After these three wicked Persons were carried
away, the Musick began to play, and all Joy and
Mirth went forward; but none came up to that of
<HI>Chery</HI>'s and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>'s, who were as happy at they
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
wish'd to be; for the King, sensible of his Nephew's
Merit, compleated the Happiness of that Day, by
marrying him to his Daughter. The Prince, trans∣ported
with Joy, cast himself at his feet; and
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> discover'd no less Satisfaction. But, not
to forget the old Princess, who had in a kind of
Solitude spent so many Years, but to let her par∣take
of the Joy, the same Fairy that had been so
entertain'd by her, at the same moment, went and
told her all that happen'd at Court, and asked her
to go with her thither. The grateful Princess
went with her in her Chariot of blue and gold,
preceded by all manner of warlike Instruments,
and follow'd by five hundred Body-Guards, richly
cloth'd; and by the way, the Fairy told her the
History of her Grand-Children, how she had never
forsaken them, but had protected them under the
Shape of a Syren and a Turtle, and all upon the
account of the charitable Reception she gave her.
The good Princess was every moment for kissing
her Hand, to shew her Acknowledgment, and
could not think of Expressions to declare her Joy.
When they arriv'd at Court, the King receiv'd
them with a thousand Testimonies of Friendship.
The Queen <HI>Blondina,</HI> and her Children, were glad
to see the Princess, and earnest to express the
Gratitude and Obligations to that illustrious Lady,
whom the old Princess told them was the kind
Turtle that guided them; who, to compleat the
King's Satisfaction, told him, that his Mother-in-law,
whom he always took for a poor Country
Woman, was a Sovereign Princess: which was the
only thing perhaps wanting to that Monarch's
Happiness. And to conclude, the Corsair and his
Wife were sent for, that they might receive a no∣ble
Recompence, for the extraordinary Education
they bestow'd on them.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Story of the Princess <HI>Fair-Star</HI> filled <HI>Dan∣dinardiere</HI>
with so much Admiration, that,
with his good-will, he would have spent the
whole Evening in commending it; and in the Ex∣cess
of his Raptures, taking <HI>Virginia</HI> by the Hand,
pulled her so rudely to him, that, not being pre∣pared,
she fell upon the Viscount, and he upon
the Ground. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> seem'd amazed at this
Disorder; he accus'd his Stars a thousand times,
in the most lofty Expressions, for persecuting him
in this manner, telling the Company, that he ne∣ver
thought of succeeding so ill in a piece of Gal∣lantry,
into which his Admiration had engag'd him.
“It is a very odd way of pleasing, <HI>said the young
H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roine,</HI> to pull one so rudely by the Arm, to lame
me for some days.” “Neither have I, Monsieur
<HI>Dandinardiere, said the Viscount,</HI> been much better
used; and what vexes me most, is, that in my
fall, my Peruke fell off; and as I give myself,
as much as I am able, all the Airs of a young
Man, I am very much at a nonplus to justify my
grey Hairs, before these Ladies.” “I see by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Dandinardiere, said the Prior,</HI> that you in∣crease
his Pain, by talking as you do; you must
have some Consideration for a Gentleman that is
wounded: I swear, had he broke my Neck, I
would not have said a word.” “I am obliged to
you, <HI>said he;</HI> but alas! the Ladies have other
Privileges, Cruelty is their Appennage and Sup∣port,
and the fair <HI>Virginia</HI> knows too well how
to maintain her Rights.” “Reproach me not for
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
complaining, <HI>said she;</HI> any other but myself would
have cry'd out louder.” “But, to speak sincerely,
I have the Sentiments of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> and meet
with the Rigour of an <HI>Alexandretta, said he,</HI> (with
an abundance of Joy, thinking he had made use of a
most delicate and uncommon Expression, and won∣dred
that no body applauded it, looking upon the
Company with such an Air of Merit, that the Gen∣tlemen
could scarce contain from laughing.) When
<HI>Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onida,</HI> who was always most liberal of her
Praises, forbore some time, but at last cry'd out,
upon the Fineness of the Expression of <HI>Alexan∣dretta,</HI>
and on the Beauties it included; which
were hid from, and unknown to the Vulgar. Then
<HI>Virginia</HI> taking upon her the Discourse, told him
he had a superiour Wit, and was capable of po∣lishing
the whole World, of banishing all Ob∣scurities,
and to give the last Perfection to Lan∣guage;
which were follow'd by a thousand such like
Extravagances: for these Ladies had an inexhaustible
Store of them.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> charm'd and confounded together,
clapped his armed Hands together, and was for an∣swering
all together; insomuch, that he knew not
what he said, but had like to have choaked him∣self,
and crow'd like a young Child, or drunken
Man; getting out sometimes, Your very humble
Servant, you are too favourable to my small Me∣rit;
Your very humble Servant. It being very
late, Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> thinking it fit to give the
sick Man some time to repose himself, took her
leave of him, and bid him good night, and was
follow'd by the rest of the Company; leaving <HI>Alain</HI>
in a Corner of the Room, with a mortify'd Coun∣tenance;
which shew'd his Sorrow for his Lord
and Master's Fall, whom, out of respect, he durst not
approach, till he calling kindly, said, “Reach me
my Night-Cap, instead of this Turbant, which,
though it becomes me very well, is very trouble∣some:
I cannot tell what the <HI>Turks</HI> do to theirs,
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
for mine is always falling off.” O! Sir, <HI>an∣swer'd</HI>
Alain, <HI>with his ordinary Simplicity,</HI> don't won∣der
at that, for the Devil's their Friend, and
can make them stay on faster than if they were
held on by Ribbands: Now the Ladies, who are
not so great <HI>Turks</HI> as the <HI>Grand-Turk,</HI> are forced
to wear great Bunches of Ribbands.” “A Tur∣bant,
you mean, you Fool, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere; I
cannot bear to hear you speak so improper.”
“O! if I am improper, <HI>said</HI> Alain, <HI>who did not un∣derstand
him rightly,</HI> you know it is not my fault;
for it rain'd when I box'd in the Yard, and since
that, you have tumbled and tossed me about your
Chamber; and you know white Walls never
do one's Clothes any good. I protest, Sir, my
Heart always achs when I see you in a Passion
in a dirty Place, which proceeds from my Fear
of getting Spots upon my Clothes.” “I know ve∣ry
well, <HI>said his Master,</HI> that you have a great
Consideration for what Goods are mine; and I
assure you, I shall take care to make you pull
off your Livery, when I beat you again.” “That's
a very bad Promise, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain, for since you
have been here, your Blows are worse than the
brushing them: It was not long since I was your
faithful Domestick, and well-beloved, as my good
old Grandmother used to say, when she put
Cabbage into the Pot; and I think I may use
this Comparison, that you are the Pot, and I
the Cabbage, which you cultivate and water, to
eat me, that is to say, to beat me: You love
me no otherwise; Ha! ha! ha! I am a Fool
to—but I will say no more.” Here he left
off, and happy was it for him, since he saved there∣by
some Strokes that his Master, who began to
be chafed by his arguing in this manner, was going
to bestow upon him.</P>
<P>By this time, Supper came up, and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI>
by tormenting himself all day, eat enough to make
a Famine; and after that, fell into so sound a
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
Sleep, that he never waked, till Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> the
Chirurgeon knock'd at his Chamber-door the next
Morning, with his Fist and Feet.” “Ah! Mon∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur
<HI>Dandinardiere, cry'd he, as loud as he could bawl,</HI>
they say that you design to go away without
paying me for the Care I have taken of your
Head; but I shall watch your Door, you shall
not give me the slip: it is the true Way to
be rich indeed, to promise, and never to pay;
Fair Words butter no Parsnips: I am not to be so
bubbled; you shall pay me, or I am very much
mistaken.” <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> surprized and inraged at
the Insolence of Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> listen'd to him, while
he pronounced his Proverbs like another <HI>Sancho
Pancha;</HI> and afterwards, awaking his Valet, who
was in a sound Sleep, and bidding him softly come to
him, said, “Thou hear'st the Impertinence of this
rascally Chirurgeon, he would be paid for the
Care he takes to kill me; could he think me so
void of Honour and Honesty not to satisfy him?
He deserves to be well thresh'd; but I am not
in the humour to give myself so much trouble
about such a sorry Fellow. Besides, it is thy Bu∣siness,
I would have thee make a quick and sud∣den
salley upon him, throw him down, and
give him twenty or thirty Blows; I'll back you:
And this is what he shall get for his Impudence.”
“You'll back me! <HI>answer'd</HI> Alain: Pray, Sir, what
is it you will do to back me?” “I will go softly
behind thee, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> and bolt the Door after
thee; for if thou shouldst chance to be the weak∣est,
he will come in to me: and I scorn, as I told
you before, to lay my hands on him.” “Ah! Sir,
<HI>answer'd</HI> Alain, I scorn him as much, and I de∣sire
you not to make me fight with a Man so
much beneath me.” “How long, <HI>added the Cit,</HI>
have you been such a Braggadocio?” “I don't
know what that means, <HI>said the Valet,</HI> but to tell
you truly, I find my Sides sore, since yester∣day's
Work. Would you have the heart to send
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
me against a fresh Man, whom I despise so much?
Believe me, Sir, you had better take the pains
yourself to beat him, since it cannot be done by
any one more proper.” “I should have learnt
him already how to make such a noise when he
asks Money of such a Gentleman as me, <HI>said</HI>
Dandinardiere, was he not so much below me.”
“Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain, you beat me almost every
day, and I swear he is of a better Family; my
Father was a Farrier, and he is a Surgeon; which
I am sure is the more honourable Profession,
and may make him worthy your Strokes.” “If
you hand down a thousand Genealogies, <HI>cry'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, you shall not provoke me more;
but I know thee to be a Poltroon, and love to
sleep in a whole Skin.”</P>
<P>While he was loading, in a low Voice, the pru∣dent
<HI>Alain</HI> with these injurious Speeches, Mr. <HI>Robert</HI>
kept knocking at the Door, which made the inra∣ged
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who could not bear the thoughts
of exposing himself to any more Dangers, think of
an odd way of revenging himself. As there was a
Hole at the bottom of the Door, through which the
Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> used to pass; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> got out of Bed, and
finding neither Shoes nor Slippers, and fearing to
catch cold, drew on his Boots, and taking up the
Tongs, went softly to the Door, and catch'd Mr.
<HI>Robert</HI> by the Legs, who thinking himself bit by a
Serpent, durst not look at his Feet, but made such
a terrible Out<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, that, together with <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s
laughing, who fail'd not to ply well the Tongs,
the whole Family was alarm'd. The Viscount and
Prior, whose Chambers lay next to his, and by
whose Management this Scene came to be acted,
rose presently, and came to appease this Quarrel.
Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> was a <HI>Norman,</HI> and as fond, to be sure,
of a Law-suit as a broken Leg or Arm. “Gentle∣men,
<HI>said he,</HI> bear witness, I am lamed for ever.”
He could say no more, for just then <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
pinch'd so hard, that he turn'd pale and speechless.
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
The Viscount and Prior could not forbear laughing
at this new manner of fighting; but as it was then
time to pacify the inraged Spirits of both sides,
they desired <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> to make a Truce, let go
the Tongs, and open the Door. For Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> as
soon as he found himself at liberty, he ran away,
protesting against so bad a Pay-master, and resolving
to sue him all his Life.</P>
<P>The Cit, who never had the pleasure of making
his Enemy quit the Field before, grew so proud
upon it, that without reflecting on the Irregularity
of his Dress, which was only a Shirt and Boots, he
strutted about the Room with the Tongs on his
shoulder, like another <HI>Hercules</HI> with his Club. “You
are in a very great Passion, <HI>said the Prior;</HI> are not
you afraid it should make you worse?” “I fear
nothing, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> not Death itself in its most
terrible Shapes.” “This past Action of yours, <HI>said
the Viscount with a serious Face,</HI> shews your Intrepi∣dity;
but for all that, I think you ought to pay
this poor Fellow, who has nothing to live on but
his Business.” “He is a Rogue, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
who ought to pay me for the Mischief he has
done? I should have been well without him; the
Villain would have cut my Skin like a piece of
Paper.” “A little Generosity, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> will
make things easy; he is ignorant as well as a
great many others, but that is not his fault per∣haps:
but I would advise you as a Friend, not to
be so obstinate as to refuse him some Pistoles.”
“Now you are upon your banter, Monsieur <HI>le Prior,
said</HI> Dandinardiere, I came not directly from <HI>Pa∣ris</HI>
to be made a Fool of in the Country: this is
not the first difference I have had in my life, and
I have always come off with flying Colours.” “In∣deed
I believe it, <HI>said</HI> Alain, <HI>braving it also,</HI> my
Master's a dreadful Man; and I as his Servant
partake somewhat of his Nature.” “Honest Friend
<HI>Alain, said the Viscount,</HI> don't be so imprudent; for
what will be the consequence of a Process where∣in
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
in your Name shall be put down?” “Why, <HI>said
he,</HI> I saw nothing; it was all done through the
Hole of the Door; nay, I did not so much as
reach my Master the Tongs: Well, let him bring
his Process, and see if I cannot defend it; I have
an Uncle a Lawyer, and may get Law as cheap
as he.” “Courage, my Boy, <HI>said the Viscount laugh∣ing,</HI>
here's the <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Bartholus</HI> of our time
united against Mr. <HI>Robert:</HI> for my part I am a
lover of Peace; I'll go and dress myself to fetch
the Olive-Branch.” “And I, <HI>said the Cit,</HI> will get to
bed again, for this Knave has disturbed me too
soon.” And then they all parted.</P>
<P>Never was Joy greater than <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s, to
think of the Exploit he had perform'd; he talk'd a
long time to his Man about it, telling him, that
when he ever undertook to chastise any one, he
did it to some purpose. Upon which, <HI>Alain,</HI> who
had never before seen him do any thing more than
himself, began to look upon him with more Re∣spect.
“I must own, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> you have made
amends for the Dread you have always had of
<HI>Villeville,</HI> and I doubt not but you will now fight
him.” “O, that's an old Quarrel, <HI>said</HI> Dandinar∣diere,
that you do well to remind me of; I am
persuaded that Spark has thought better on it,
than to be so void of Sense as to measure Swords
with me.” “But at a venture, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Alain,
would you if he would?” “I know not, <HI>said</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>shaking his Head two or three times,</HI> it
is not that I want Courage, for I have enough of
that: but when I think of the Adventure that
befel me by the Sea-side, and of that Demon so
like a Man, as never were two Drops of Water
more like one another, and who brought me that
villainous Challenge, which has made me fret
ever since; I must sincerely confess, <HI>Alain,</HI> that
I had rather you should fight him than myself.”
“But I am not such a Fool, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain: What!
you would deliver me into the Lion's Mouth that
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
this Devil, if he is one, should carry me ready
drest, and in my Shoes and Stockings, into the
other World. Indeed, Sir, though I have not so
much Money as yourself, my Life's as sweet to
me as yours; for it is not Money altogether that
can make us happy; we must have Health, or
one had as good be dead: Now if I fight with
this Magician, and he should put out my Eyes,
cut my Wind-pipe, or run me through the Heart,
do you believe in your conscience that I should
be very well after it?” “How do you know,
Coward, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>in a Passion,</HI> that
<HI>Villeville</HI> would serve you so?” “O, it is very easy
to be believ'd, <HI>said</HI> Alain, for Devils have more
Power than Fairies; and if you remember the
Story that was told yesterday, they could make
Apples sing like Nightingales, Birds to talk as well
as Doctors, and Water to dance as well as the
best Masters. After all this, have not I reason to
be afraid?” “You are a strange Fellow, <HI>said his
Master,</HI> to torment yourself and me as you do;
for there's now no talk of <HI>Villeville:</HI> therefore let
me taste the pleasure of my Victory, and go to
sleep, thou Disturber of my Repose.” <HI>Alain</HI> drew
the Curtains, wish'd his Master a good Nap, and
afterwards went to the Window which look'd into
the great Road, where he pass'd away an Hour in
killing the Flies, he being their declared Enemy;
when <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lleville</HI> passing by, and looking up acciden∣tally,
saw him; and knowing that his very Name
struck a terrour both into <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> and his
Man, and thinking this Adventure might be plea∣sant
enough, held up a Pistol to him, as if he would
kill him. “Ah! <HI>cry'd</HI> Alain <HI>holding up his Hands,</HI> be
pleased not to mistake me; remember the Strokes
you gave me some time since, which I swear I
have never bore you any Malice for.” <HI>Villeville</HI>
returning no answer, but remaining in the same
posture, and <HI>Alain</HI>'s Fears increasing the more, he
said, “I see you have a mind to kill some-body,
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
stay a moment, I would rather it should be my
Master than myself; I'll go and awake him, tho
I know he will be very sorry.” Hereupon he ran,
and pull'd <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> by the Arm; “Sir, <HI>said he,</HI>
be pleased to rise, here's one at the Window that
wants to see you.” At which he getting up, and
putting on his Night-Gown and Boots, went to the
Window; but O Heavens! what a sight was there,
<HI>Villeville</HI> with a Pistol in his hand! He never staid,
like his Man, to make a fine Compliment, but ran
directly under the Bed, which nothing but his Fear
could have made him succeed in, for the Bed was very
low; but a Pistol ready cock'd was a terrible thing,
He had not lain there long, but he found it very
heavy, and thought nothing could be more dange∣rous
than the Condition he was in, and therefore
at all hazards resolved to get back again; but all
his Endeavours were in vain, the Bed was so low,
that he was crush'd under it: he cry'd out, “<HI>Alain,</HI>
help me, or I shall die.” But that faithful Ser∣vant
never heard him, having hid himself be∣hind
a Cupboard, which he used to lie in;
and having raised it up, held it with both his
hands, as the only thing in the World to secure
him.</P>
<P><HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lleville</HI> seeing neither Master nor Man appear,
fired twice, which put <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> into such a
Fright, that he could not speak a long time after∣wards.
<HI>Alain</HI> threw down the Cupboard, which
he had taken so much pains to hold up, and falling
with his Head foremost, but not very hard, because
it was upon the Bed, tumbled to the other end of
the Room. Messieurs <HI>de St. Thomas, Berg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nville,</HI> and
the Prior were in the Hall, which was under <HI>Dan∣dinardiere</HI>'s
Room, consulting about him; and it
would be hard if the great noise that was made
should have escaped their Ears. They thought it
was either Thunder, or that Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> return'd,
to take revenge for being so rudely pinch'd; and
made haste to be Spectators of some new S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene.
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
When they enter'd the Room, they found <HI>Alain</HI>
stretch'd out at length upon the ground, and going
to his Master's Bed, heard a plaintive Sound, but
could not imagine from whence it came. They
ask'd <HI>Alain</HI> several times where he was, but he put∣ting
his Finger to his Mouth, to denote Silence,
pointed to the Window, which they looked out at,
not knowing whether he was so great a Fool as to
break his Neck. In short, they could not under∣stand
<HI>Alain</HI> by his mysterious Signs: still the same
melancholy Accents continued, and our Hero suf∣fer'd
all the time; when the Baron looking under
the Bed, to his no small Amazement, saw his
Legs. <HI>Alain</HI> taking heart at their Presence, came
to help them, and catching hold of one of the
Boots, into which his Master's Leg was not so hard
wedged, as his Body was under the Bed, and pul∣ling
with all his strength, it slipt off, and he fell
backward on his Breech. “Very well, very well,
<HI>said he in a pleasant manner, tho u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heard by the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣tlemen,
who were too busy with his Master,</HI> the Fairies
have endow'd me with a Fit of tumbling to-day;
but to remedy it, I will rise no more.” First,
they pull'd by one Leg, and sometimes by both,
to get him out of this Trap; but as all this time
his Shoulders and Back had but a bad time on't,
they bethought themselves of throwing off the Bed
and Bed-clothes, to give the more liberty, and by
that means got him out, with his Face and Nose
scratch'd, and as red as Scarlet, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid him upon
the Bed, ordering his Valet to go for some Wine,
and <HI>Hungary</HI>-Water, to rub his Tempies. “I desire
you, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Alain <HI>to the Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a,</HI> to take the pains
to go yourself; for, to hide nothing from you,
that terrible Monster, <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> is somewhere a∣bout
the House, and I dread the sight of him more
than Thunder.” “Hold your tongue, you foolish
Babbler, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere; who told you that
<HI>Villeville</HI> came and fired two Pistols at my Win∣dow,
and frighten'd me!” “I never said a word
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
of it, <HI>answer'd</HI> Alain; but now you have discover'd
all.” “Don't believe him, <HI>said our Cit,</HI> I should
not be afraid of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcules,</HI> and much less of him;
but my Raseal of a Valet has sometimes such
strong Visions, that he believes them to be true.
But to let you know how I came to be where
you found me, I dreamt that I, getting out of
bed to fight, and having put my Enemy to flight,
he run under it, and in the height of my Rage,
and heat of Passion, I pursued him; but when I
was there, I awaked, vexed at myself, but not
much surprized, being used to such like Fancies
in my Sleep: for the Court has known for these
many Years, that I have gone often a swimming
in my Sleep.”</P>
<P>While he was talking after this manner, <HI>Alain</HI>
made signs to the contrary; but Monsieur <HI>de St. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mas,</HI>
who strove to oblige him, reply'd, that what
he said was all true; because he knew <HI>Villeville</HI> to
be somewhat disorder'd in his Brain: for that if he
was well, he would not be so much an Enemy to
himself, to seek to lose his Life with a Man more
dangerous than either <HI>Mars</HI> or <HI>Hercules.</HI> The Vis∣count
and Prior said something to the same pur∣pose,
which made <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> thinking that they
believed him, resume his former Good-humour, and
dispose himself to advance some more Lyes; but
those Gentlemen thought fit to leave him, to drink
his <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and use his <HI>Hungary</HI>-Water.</P>
<P>When they were at liberty to talk among them∣selves,
the Baron <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> addressing himself to
the Viscount, said, “I think you almost as mad as
the Cit himself, to propose him for my Son-in-law.”
“You may say what you please, <HI>answer'd he.</HI> but I
maintain my Vision is not ridiculous; and if there's
any thing embarassing, it is not the Opportunities,
for we all know there are enough, but how to
make this covetous Wretch marry a Lady of Qua∣lity
for her fine Eyes.” “Did you observe ye∣sterday,
<HI>interrupted the Prior,</HI> his Pretensions to a
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
Fortune? If we are not very sly and cunning,
this Match will be knock'd on the head.” “It is
no great matter, <HI>said the Baron, smiling,</HI> I shall not
be very sorry.” “I can assure you, <HI>continued the
Viscount,</HI> he is very rich, and with his bragging
Impertinencies, which all tend to the Preserva∣tion
of himself, he is not to be bit out of his Mo∣ney:
it was I that set Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> upon him.” “I
know your Views therein, <HI>answer'd Monsieur</HI> St.
Thomas, but I m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st leave the Management of this
Affair to you.” Some Persons coming in upon
them, broke off this Conversation; and the Prior
being inform'd that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> could not sleep,
went to bear him company.</P>
<P>When he came to his Chamber-door, he stopt,
because he heard him talking with <HI>Alain.</HI> “What,
<HI>said he,</HI> do you think I can forgive such an Af∣front?”
“How should I know it would disoblige
you? <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain: I spoke nothing but the naked
Truth of what I saw; any one, as well as I,
would have said the same: I saw you under the
Bed, and know you had good reason to be there.”
“You knew! <HI>reply'd his Master,</HI> who could tell you?”
“My own Heart, <HI>said</HI> Alain, which is Flesh and
Bone as well as yours, which was ready to die
away for fear; for had it not been for the Cup∣board,
which I crept behind, certainly I had not
been alive this moment.” “I think you very bold,
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, to judge of my Sentiments
by your own; Heroes never measure by the Bushel
of such a Rascal as thou art: if I did run under
the Bed, it was because I would not receive the
Shot of a Traitor, who durst not attack me, but
at a distance.” “You have forgot then, <HI>reply'd</HI> A∣lain,
that you run under the Bed a quarter of an
hour before <HI>Villeville</HI> fired that terrible Pistol or
Cannon; for I know not which it was.” “Hold thy
tongue, Hangtrace, <HI>reply'd he;</HI> I ever made some
small account of thy Courage hitherto, but now
I know thee, and wait with impatience till I go
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
home, to dismiss thee.” “Alas! Sir, <HI>said he, very
sorrowful,</HI> what have I done to deserve it? I am
fearful as well as you, is it a Crime? Ought I
to be more brave than my Master? Had you
hired me to fight, I would not have promised
without performing, and you should have had no
reason to complain; but there was not a word
about it.” <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was glad at heart to see
his Man so concern'd, and pleased to think he
loved him, said, “Down on your knees, and ask
pardon, I begin to relent.” Accordingly <HI>Alain</HI> did
so. “Well, <HI>said he,</HI> I forgive you, and will do
more for you, I will give you a good Heart.”
'Then blowing into his Ears, said, “There's a Pro∣vision
of Courage; you may depend upon it, it
will make you fight.” “Without being beat?” <HI>cry'd</HI>
Alain. “Yes, I'll warrant it,” <HI>said the Master.</HI>
“Then, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> I thank you; but if you would
please to blow me a hundred Crowns, I should
be more at ease: for indeed I would have no
Contention with any one, and a little Money
will make me more courageous.”</P>
<P>The Prior finding that this Conversation would
not soon have an end, after having laughed heartily
to himself, went into the Room. “I believed you
might be asleep, <HI>said he,</HI> for I thought you went
to bed again with that intention.” “That's true,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, I had, but Love is a cruel
Disturber in a Morning; whenever I closed my
Eyclids, my Thoughts represented <HI>Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>honida</HI> more charming than <HI>Aurora.</HI>” “In∣deed,
I believe your Passion is not over-violent,
<HI>said the Prior;</HI> for if I have not forgot, you pre∣fer'd
Riches to Beauty and Merit; and that De∣claration
has cast a Veil over your good Qualities,
as the Body of the Moon shades the Sun in an
Eclipse.” “I am mightily pleased with this Com∣parison,
<HI>reply'd the Cit;</HI> but do you think I make the
World acquainted with the Secrets of my Amours?
No, Sir, they must be a little mysterious.” “If you
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
speak sincerely, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> I offer you my As∣sistance
in your Designs; <HI>Virginia</HI> has Merit.” “But
what Fortune has she?” <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere. “What
they please to give her,” <HI>answer'd the Prior.</HI> “But
don't you know how much that is?” <HI>reply'd he.</HI>
“Something considerable, <HI>said the Prior;</HI> an Income
better than any Estate in this Country.” “You
mean, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, some Houses in <HI>Paris.</HI>”
“No, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> something better, pleasant Sto∣ries,
and nobody knows what they may turn to.”
The Cit seem'd no ways to relish this: “Ha, ha!
<HI>said he, after some time thinking,</HI> one ought to have
something besides, to enter into a Contract of
Marriage; for if she brings nothing else, it will
be but a small Support for a Family.” “O! <HI>cry'd
the Prior,</HI> Wit is very valuable.” “I am not so ig∣norant,
<HI>reply'd the other,</HI> as to despise Wit, I would
only have a reasonable Competency with it; for
I protest, as to the Tales or Stories you boast so
much of, I can make some myself, and make Mo∣ney
of them too.” “I should be very glad to see
some of them, <HI>said the Prior;</HI> you believe, with∣out
doubt, that it is nothing but uttering some
Hyperboles together, and then the Work's done:
but I declare there's more Contrivance and Art
in them, tho I see several every day that have
nothing agreeable in them.” “That's as much as
to say, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, that mine will be
of that Class: Upon my word, Sir, you are very
obliging, but I will make one, or see why not;
then you will change your Tone.” “I shall never
refuse my Commendations, <HI>said the Prior obligingly,
to appease him;</HI> you shall begin to-day. “I intend
so to do, <HI>said the other;</HI> do you think I have been
at so much pains and cost to have my Study of
Books brought here, not to use them?” “It will
be your own fault, <HI>added the Prior,</HI> if I don't assist
you as I did before.” This Proposition sweeten'd
him again, he pulled the Prior by the Sleeve, and
whispering him, for fear <HI>Alain</HI> should hear, said to
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
him, “The pains they require almost dismays me,
and my Genius tends not much to Writings of
this kind; therefore shall I be so happy as to
have the honour of another Story from you, that
I may let <HI>Virginia</HI> know I have as good a Talent
this way as she herself.” “That's as much as to
say, <HI>reply'd the Prior,</HI> you would give her a <HI>Rowland</HI>
for her <HI>Oliver,</HI> and have as much Pretension to
the Empire of the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI>” “My Ambition's
no less, <HI>answer'd</HI> Dandinardiere, therefore be my
Friend this time, I conjure you.”</P>
<P>The Prior having promised him what he desired,
took his leave of him, and going into the Hall,
found there two Ladies of his Acquaintance, who
coming to pay Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> a Visit, their
Coach broke down with them, and obliged them
to walk a great way on foot, broiling in the Sun.
These Ladies call'd Cousins, tho they were not at
all related: the one was a Widow, and a great
Coquet; and the other had lately married an old
Gentleman, who had amassed together great Riches,
and who might brag he had married a Woman that
knew how to spend as fast. The older of the two,
who was Madam <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uet,</HI> was the Widow of a very
honest Gentleman; but she was a Woman that
loved Play and Junketings, was very expensive in
Clothes, and painted extravagantly: all which con∣sumed
a great part of his Estate. That day the
Sun had melted it half off, and she was looking
in the Glass to lay on White where it wanted, and
rub off the Red that had run down, when the Prior
came in, which vexed her not a little, for he was
the first who made his Appearance. Monsieur <HI>St.
Thomas</HI> being abroad among his Workmen, and
Madam adjusting herself, when Madam <HI>de Lure,</HI>
who was the new-married Lady, seeing her so busy,
to give her the more liberty to form her Com∣plexion,
took the Prior on one side, telling him,
that while her Cousin was setting her Head-dress,
she would show him a Story, with which he would
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
certainly be in love. To which he reply'd, that
if it was long, they should not be able to make an
end of it before dinner. “O! <HI>said she,</HI> I intend
only to read the Name of it to you, and I am sure
you will be desirous to hear it: it is the Story
of the Princess <HI>Carpillona:</HI> What say you to it?”
“I am so much a Stranger, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to these sort
of Works, that I cannot judge of them by their
Titles.” Upon which, she banter'd him, till
casting her Eyes upon her Cousin <HI>Rouet,</HI> and see∣ing
she had done, she took no farther notice of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
Story. By this time, the Baron was inform'd of
their Arrival; who came presently to them, ac∣companied
by the Viscount <HI>Berginville:</HI> and not
knowing how to divert them till dinner-time, af∣ter
having saluted them, and been inform'd by
them of the Accident that befell them, he pro∣pos'd
walking in a little Wood, where there were
so ne pretty Fishponds, shaded by the Trees, un∣der
which were raised pleasant Banks, enamell'd
with Flowers and Camomile; which was cooler,
and more refreshing than the Hall. As soon as
they were sat down, the Prior knowing Dinner
would be somewhat late, to amuse them till then,
begg'd the Favour of Madam <HI>de Lure,</HI> to regale
the Company with her Story: which she pulling
out of her Pocket, desired him to read.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of the Princess Carpillona.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived some Ages ago, an old King,
who, to make amends for a long Widow∣hood,
marry'd a young beautiful Princess, with
whom he was very much in love. By his first
Wife he had one Son, who was both crooked and
squint-ey'd, and who was very much displeased at
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
his Father's marrying a second time. “My being
my Father's only Son, <HI>said he,</HI> makes me both
loved and feared; but if the young Queen has
Children, my Father, who can dispose of his
Crown as he pleases, will not consider that I
am his eldest Son, but will disinherit me for
them.” He was not only ambitious and malicious,
but a great Dissembler; insomuch, that he shewed
not the least Uneasiness, but went privately to
consult a Fairy, who passed then for one of the
most able. The Fairy told him he was come too late,
that the Queen was with Child of a Son, to which
she would do no harm; but if he died, or any ill
Accident befell him, she promised the Queen
should have no more: Which comforted the Prince
a little, who, conjuring the Fairy not to forget
him, return'd home, resolving with himself, to make
away with his little Brother.</P>
<P>At nine Months end, the Queen was delivered
of a lovely Boy, in whom there was something
very remarkable, he having an Arrow imprinted on
his Arm. The Queen was so fond of her Child,
that she would nurse it herself, which was no way
pleasing to the crooked Prince, the Mother's Care
being always beyond any Nurse's, and it being
not so easy for him to accomplish his Designs. Ne∣vertheless,
he resolv'd to make an Attempt. He
shew'd a great Value and Respect for the Queen,
and a Tenderness towards the Infant, of which
the King was very fond: “I could not have
thought, <HI>said he,</HI> my Son so good-natur'd; he shall
lose nothing by it: for if he continues to be so,
I'll leave half my Kingdom to him.” These Pro∣mises
were not enough for the Prince, he was re∣solv'd
to have all or none; and to that end, one
Night presented some Comfits made up with Opium,
to the Queen, who soon after fell into a sound
Sleep; and then the Prince, who had hid himself
behind the Hangings, took the Child away softly,
and put in its stead, a Cat wrapt up in Swaddling-Clothes.
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
The Cat cry'd, and waken'd the Queen;
who being drowsy, and thinking it her little Pop∣pet,
gave it her Breast; which the Cat bit: where∣upon
looking, and seeing the Cat's Head, she
shriek'd out. Her Grief was so lively, that she
thought she should have died away that mo∣ment.
The Noise and Skreamings of the Women
alarm'd the whole Court. The King put on his
Nightgown, and ran into her Apartment; where
the first thing he beheld, was the Cat in the
Swaddling-Clothes, thrown on the ground, and
mewing. The King was very much surprized, and
asked what that meant; they told him, the young
Prince was not to be found, and that the Queen
was hurt. Thereupon, he went immediatly into
her Chamber; where he found her in Affliction,
not to be expressed: the which, that he might not
augment by his own Sorrow, he constrain'd him∣self,
to comfort that poor Princess.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the crook'd-back Prince had
given his little Brother to one of his Creatures,
bidding him carry him to some distant Forest, and
expose him naked to the wild Beasts, that he
might be heard no more of, promising to reward
him well, and then return'd to his own Apartment;
from whence he ran into the Queen's, rubbing his
Eyes, as if he was asleep: where, when he was
inform'd of what had happen'd, he stampt and
roar'd like a mad Man, and, out of his natural
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rceness, twisted the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Head off; and in this
manner, disguised the Crime he was so deeply
g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilty of, shedding many Tears. The King and
Queen, who thought too well of him, sent him
to all the Fairies, to learn what was become of
their Child; and he, to put a stop to any further
Enquiries, return'd with several different and in∣tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate
Answers; which all seem'd to assure them,
that the Child was not dead, but was, for to me
Reasons not to be known, only taken away for a
time, and that all their searching any more after
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
him would be to no purpose. This he thought
would make them easy, and indeed it had its ef∣fect;
for the King and Queen both flattered them∣selves
with the Hopes of seeing their Son again.
Notwithstanding, the Queen's Breast gangreen'd, and
she died: Upon which, the King became so afflict∣ed
and sorowful, that he saw no Light for a Twelve-month,
living only in expectation of hearing some
news of his lost Child.</P>
<P>The Man whom the Prince delivered him to,
travelled all night with him, without making the
least halt; and in the morning, when he open'd
the Basket, in which he carried him, this pret∣ty
Infant smiled, as he was used to do at his Mo∣ther.
“O! poor Prince, <HI>said the Man,</HI> how un∣happy
is thy Fate, to serve, alas! for Food to
some hungry Lion? Why did the Prince, thy
Brother, make choice of me, to be assisting to
thy Destruction?” Then he shut the Basket a∣gain,
that he might not behold an Object so wor∣thy
his Pity; but upon the Child's crying, who
had not had the Breast all night, to quiet it, he
gathered some Figs, and put into its Mouth, and
so carried it all that day: and the Night following,
arriv'd at a vast Forest, which he would not enter
then, for fear of being devour'd himself, but stay'd
till the Morning; when advancing in the Forest,
which was so large, he could see no end, he per∣ceiv'd
a place where the Trees stood very thick,
and a Rock in the midst of them, that branched
out into several Points. “This Place, <HI>said he,</HI> must
certainly be a Retreat to the wild Beasts; here
I must leave the Child, since it is not in my
power to save it.” Then approaching towards the
Rock, he saw a large Eagle flying about, as if she
had young ones; and looking farther, found her
Nest in the bottom of a kind of Grotto: thereupon,
undressing the Child, he laid it in the midst of
three young Eagles in the Nest, which was well shel∣ter'd
from the Weather, and difficult and hazar∣dous
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
to get to, by reason of the Briars it was sur∣rounded
by, and its being so nigh a Precipice.
Then leaving this young Prince, and seeing the
Eagle fly to her Nest, he, sighing, said, “Alas!
poor Infant, thy Fate is accomplish'd, thou servest
that Bird of Prey to feed her Young with.” And
afterwards return'd to his Master, and assured him
his Brother was no more. For which News, the
barbarous Prince embraced his faithful Agent, and
presented him with a fine Diamond Ring, assuring
him, he should be Captain of his Guards, when he
was King.</P>
<P>But to return to the Eagle: When she came to
her Nest, she was somewhat surprized to find this
new Guest there; however, she exercised the
Rights of Hospitality, more than some People would
do: she put him next her Nestling, cover'd him
with her Wings, took care of him, and whatever
engaged her in his favour, went and provided the
most nourishing Fruits, which she squeez'd with
her Bill into his Mouth: and, in short, made him
an excellent Nurse. When the young Eagles were
fledg'd, they left their Nest solely to the Prince, who
nevertheless was not abandon'd by the old one,
which fed him still with the choicest Fruits; and,
by some fore-sight, fearing, lest he getting out,
should fall down the Precipice, remov'd him to a∣nother
Place, which was upon an high Rock,
where he was most secure. Love, who is always
painted most beautiful, was not more perfect than
this young Prince; the Heats of the Sun could
not prejudice his Complexion, which exceeded the
Lillies and Roses; his Features were more regular
than the best Painters could imagine, his Hair
reach'd down to his Shoulders, his Mein was Ma∣jestick:
in short, nothing could be more noble.
But the Eagle having young-ones again, she made
such havock among all the neighbouring Flocks,
that the Shepherds, losing every now and then a
Lamb, resolv'd to discover her Nest: And to that
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
end, agreed to watch her; which they did for
a long time: when one day, they observed, she
lit upon this Rock, which the most hardy of them
resolv'd to climb; though the Attempt was very
dangerous. yet it answer'd their Expectation.
They discovered the Nest, and found in it, two
young Eagles, and this young Prince; who was
about four Years old. Their Amazement at the
sight of him is inexpressible; and they could not
tell what to imagine at such an extraordinary
thing. However, they tore the Nest in pieces, and
carried away the young Prince and the two Eagles.
The Eagle hearing their Cries, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e furiously to∣wards
them, and had made these Ravishers feel
the Effects of her Resentment, had not one of the
Shepherds kill'd her with an Arrow he let fly at
her. The young Prince seeing his Nurse fall,
cry'd and wept bitterly: And the Shepherds, o∣verjoy'd
with what they had done, return'd to
their Hamlet; where they were to perform, the
next day, a cruel Ceremony: the Cause of which,
was as follows.</P>
<P>This Country had served a long time for a Retreat
of the <HI>Ogr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (who were a larger sort of Men, and
great Eaters of human Flesh) and not liking such
dangerous Neighbours, had endeavour'd, but
with ill Success, to drive them away. The <HI>Ogri,</HI>
inraged at the Hatred they bore them, redoubled
their Cruel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, and devour'd all that came to their
hands. When one day as the Shepherds were as∣sembled
together, to deliberate on what they should
do; there appear'd in the midst of them a Man of
a prodigious size, the lower part of whose Body
was like a Goat, cover'd with a blue Shag; on his
Shoulder he carried a great Club, and on his Left-Arm
a Buckler. “Shepherds, <HI>said he,</HI> I am the blue
Centaur; if you will give me every three years
a Child, I promise to bring an hundred of my
Brothers, and drive the <HI>Ogri</HI> away.” The Shep∣herds
made some difficulty to engage themselves in
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
so cruel an Agreement; till the elder of them
said, “What, my Friends, is it not better for us to
give one to preserve so many, since the <HI>Ogri</HI> nei∣ther
spare Men, Women, nor Children; therefore
let us not refuse the Centaur's Offer.” They all
by this Argument consented, and swore the Cen∣taur
should have a Child every third Year. After
that he went away, and return'd, as he promised,
with his Brothers, who were all as monstrous as
himself. The <HI>Ogri</HI> were no less brave than cruel;
they fought several Battles with great Obstinacy,
wherein the Centaurs were always victorious, who
forced them at last to fly. The blue Centaur de∣manded
his Recompence, which every one allow'd
to be just; but when they came to deliver up the
promised Infant, there was no Family could think
of parting with one of theirs, and the Mothers hid
all their Children. The Centaur, who could not
bear to be jested with, after having waited twice
four and twenty hours, told the Shepherds, that
he expected as many Children as they made him
wait Days; insomuch, that their Delays cost them
six Boys, and as many Girls: but since that time
they have regulated this Affair, and every third
Year make a solemn Festival, to deliver their pro∣mised
Infant to the Centaur.</P>
<P>It happen'd that the day whereon the Prince was
found, was the day before this Tribute was to be
paid; and tho there was a Child provided, it must
easily be thought that the Shepherds would deliver
this Prince in its stead. The Mother of the other,
freed by this means from all the Horrors she must
necessarily lie under in apprehensions of the death
of her Child, was transported with Joy. And as
she was obliged to dress him, she comb'd his fine
Locks, put him on a Garland of white and red
Roses, wrapt him up in a fine white Cloth, which
she girt about him with Flowers. Thus adjusted,
he walked at the head of a great many Children
that were to attend him; but I may say, it was
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
with an Air of so much Grandeur and State, as
seem'd, as if all the Shepherds made this Procession
only to divert him, so little was his Dread; which
drew Tears from many, who said, it was pity that
beautiful Child should go to be devour'd, and wish∣ed
it was in their power to save him: but that
was impossible. The Centaur was used to appear
on the top of a Rock, with his Club in one hand,
and his Buckler in the other, and with a terrible
voice to cry out to the Shepherds, “Leave me my
Prey, and retire.” This time, as soon as he per∣ceiv'd
the Child, he roar'd our in a dreadful voice,
“'This will be the best Meal I have ever made in
my Life; this Boy will be a delicious Morsel.”
Which made the Shepherds and Shepherdesses weep,
and say, “How unhappy is this Child to have esca∣ped
(which was a Prodigy) the Eagle's Talons,
to be Food for this cruel Monster!” And among
the rest an old Shepherd. taking him in his Arms,
kiss'd him often, and said, “Tho I know thee not,
dear Babe, I am sensible I have seen too much
of thee for my repose. Why must I be assisting at
thy Funeral? And why was Fortune so cruel to
preserve thee for this horrible End?” While he
was moistening this Prince's rosy Cheeks with
his Tears, this innocent Babe put his Hands into
his grey Hairs, and smiling upon him, inspired him
with more pity, that he seem'd loth to advance.
Whereupon the hungry Giant cry'd out, “Make
haste; if you make me come down, I shall devour
an hundred of you.” And indeed was so impa∣tient,
that he rose up, and made a flourish with his
Club; when, all on a sudden, there appear'd in
the Air a great Globe of Fire, incircled with a blue
Cloud. Every body was attentive to such an ex∣traordinary
sight; the Globe and Cloud approach'd
them by degrees, and when nigh the Earth open'd,
and there came out a Chariot of Diamonds, drawn
by six Swans, in which sat a beautiful Lady dress'd
like an <HI>Amazon,</HI> with an Helmet on her Head of
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
pure Gold, on which was a Plume of white Fea∣thers;
and her Visor, which was raised up, disco∣ver'd
Eyes as bright as the Sun; her Body was
arm'd with a rich Cuirass, and in her Hand she
held a Spear of Fire. “What, Shepherds, <HI>said she,</HI>
are you so inhuman to give this lovely Babe to
that cruel Centaur? It is now time to free you
from your Promise; Justice and Reason both op∣pose
such barbarous Customs: fear not the return
of the <HI>Ogri;</HI> I will secure you; I am the Fairy <HI>Ama∣zona,</HI>
and from this moment will take you under
my Protection.” “Ah! Madam, <HI>cry'd the Shepherds
and Shepherdesses, holding up their Hands,</HI> this is the
greatest Happiness that can befall us.” And were
saying a great deal more, when the furious Centaur
defy'd her to the Combat, in which he was burnt
to death by the fire of her Spear, and fell with as
much noise as if a Mountain had been overturn'd;
that the Shepherds frighten'd therewith, hid them∣selves
in Caves that were under the Rocks, from
whence they could see all that past.</P>
<P>It was thither the wise Shepherd fled with the
little Prince in his Arms, as much concern'd for
the Child as himself and Family. After the death
of the Centaur, the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> took a Trumpet,
and sounded so melodiously with it, that the sick
Persons who heard it, recover'd their former Health;
and those who were well, conceived a secret Joy
which they could not express. At last, when all
the Shepherds and Shepherdesses were assembled
together at the sound of the harmonious Trumpet,
the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> advanced towards them in her
Diamond Chariot, rolling within three yards of the
ground, on a Cloud as clear as Chrystal. The old
Shepherd, whose Name was <HI>Sublimus,</HI> appear'd with
the little Prince clinging about his Neck: “Come
forwards, <HI>Sublimus, said the Fairy,</HI> fear nothing;
Peace shall reign here for the future, and you
shall enjoy the Repose you have sought so much
after; but give me that Child whose Adventures
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
are so extraordinary.” The old Man, after making
a low bow, held out his Arms, and put the Prince
in hers; who, when she had him, caress'd and em∣braced
him a thousand times, setting him on her
Knees, and talking to him: who, tho he under∣stood
no Language, yet by Accents and Sighs he
could express Joy and Grief; for he had never
heard any Person speak before. He was so dazled
with the Fairy's bright Arms, that getting upon his
Knees to examine it from the Head-piece down∣wards,
and to touch it; the Fairy smiled and said,
tho he could not understand her, “When, my Boy,
you are fit to wear such Armour, you shall not
want.” And then returning him back to the
Shepherd, after having kiss'd him tenderly, “Wise
old Man, <HI>said she,</HI> you are no Stranger to me,
vouchsafe to take care of this Child; learn him
to despise the Grandeur of the World, and be
above the Strokes of adverse Fortune, tho he
may be born to a splendid one: but I hold it bet∣ter
to be wise than powerful. The Happiness of
Men ought not to consist in outward Greatness,
but in Wisdom, and the greatest is to know our∣selves,
to limit our Desires, to be as well conten∣ted
with a moderate Competency, as with the
greatest Riches; to search after the Est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em of
People of Merit, to despise none, and be always
ready to quit this miserable Life without regret.
But what am I thinking of, venerable Shepherd?
I am telling you things which you know as well
as myself; but then I mention them not so much
for yourself, as for the other Shepherds. Fare∣well,
Shepherds, call me when you want me;
this same Spear, and this same Hand, which put
an end to the Life of the blue Centaur, shall
always be ready to protect you.”</P>
<P><HI>Sublimus,</HI> and those who were with him, were
so confounded, and at the same time overjoy'd, that
they could return no answer to the obliging Words
of the Fairy; but prostrated themselves before her,
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
while the Globe of Fire, rising by degrees, ascen∣ded
to the middle Region of the Air, and was seen
no more. The fearful Shepherds at first durst not
approach the Centaur, tho dead; till reflecting bet∣ter
on it, they at last resolved to raise a funeral
Pile to reduce him to Ashes, lest his Brothers
might be inform'd of what had happen'd, and should
come to revenge his death.</P>
<P><HI>Sublimus</HI> carried the little Prince to his Hut; his
Wife being sick, his two Daughters had not been
able to leave her to attend the Ceremony. “Here,
Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> here's a Child beloved by
the Gods, and protected by the Fairy <HI>Amazona;</HI>
we must look upon him, for the time to come, as
our own, and give him an Education that may
make him happy.” 'The Wife was pleased with
the Present, and taking the Prince upon the Bed,
said. “I will bring him up, and cherish him in his
Infancy, but must leave the part of his Education
to yourself.” The Shepherd told her that was all
he desired, and so left him with her. The two
Daughters ran presently to see their new Brother,
were charm'd with his incomparable Beauty, and
the Graces that adorn'd his little Body; and from
that moment began to learn him to talk. Never
was Wit more extensive and lively; he compre∣hended
every thing with an Ease that amazed all
the Shepherds, and in a short time was fit to take
Lessons of the old Shepherd himse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, who was ca∣pable
of giving him whatever was excellent. He
had been King of a flourishing Nation, but by the
Intrigues of his Ministers with an Usurper, his
Neighbour and Enemy, had been surprized with
all his Family, and made a Prisoner in a strong
Fortress, there to end his days in Misery.</P>
<P>So sudden and unexpected a Change was not able
to shock the Virtue of the King and Queen in the
least; they bore all the Outrages of the Tyrant
with an unparallell'd Constancy and Firmness of
Mind. The Queen, who was big with Child when
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
these Misfortunes came upon them, was brought to
bed of a Daughter, which she was obliged to nurse
herself, as well as take care of her two others,
who partook as much of their Troubles as their
Age would admit. The King after three Years
Confinement, gain'd one of his Guards, who pro∣mised
to bring him a Boat under the Window of
the Room he was imprison'd in, to cross the Lake,
which this Fortress stood in the midst of; and pro∣vided
him Files to cut the Iron-Bars with, and
Cords to let themselves down by. They made
choice of a dark Night, and did all without any
noise; and by the assistance of this Soldier, slid
down by the Rope The King went first, then the
two Children, after them the Queen, and after her
the little Babe in a Basket: but alas! the Knot
whereby it was fasten'd slipping, they heard her
fall in the Lake: the Queen, had she not swoon'd,
would certainly have alarm'd the Garison with
her Cries and Complaints. The King, grieved at
this Accident, and sought for her as much as the
darkness of the Night would let him, and found
the Basket, but none of the Princess; so that
giving her up for lost, he row'd away as fast as he
was able, with the rest of his Family: and when
they came to the other side, found Horses, which
were provided by the same Soldier, and laid ready
for them to go where they pleased.</P>
<P>During their Confinement, the King and Queen
had time to moralize and reflect, that the greatest
Blessings this Life affords were but small, when
justly weigh'd; which, together with the new Mis∣fortune
of losing their little Daughter, made them re∣solve
not to retire to any neighbouring Prince or
Ally, to whom they might be chargeable, but to settle
in some fertile and pleasant Plain; there to change
the Scepter for a Shepherd's Crook, and buy a
Flock of Sheep. And having pitch'd on this Coun∣try,
they built a pretty Cottage, which was shel∣ter'd
from the Weather by the Mountains that
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
were behind it, and render'd pleasant by a pretty
Brook that ran before it. Here they enjoy'd more
Tranquillity than upon their Throne. There
were none that envy'd their Poverty; they feared
no Traitors nor Flatterers, and passed their Days
free fromTrouble. The King would often say,
“Ah! how happy might Men be, could they
cure themselves of Ambition? I have been a
King, but now prefer my Cottage before the
Palace, wherein I once reign'd.” Under this
great Philosopher this young Prince, ignorant of
his Master's Rank, received his Education, while
the Master was not better informed of his Pupil's;
but his Dispositions were so noble, that he could
not believe him of mean Birth. He observed with
pleasure, that he always put himself at the head
of his Companions, and, with an Air of Superiority,
drew Respect from them; he was continually form∣ing
Armies, building Forts, and attacking them,
and whenever his Father (as we must call him)
took him along with him a hunting, would face
the greatest Dangers. All these things persuaded
him, that he was born to command; but till he
arrives at fifteen Years of Age, let us leave him to
his Studies, and return to his Father's Court.</P>
<P>The crook-back'd Prince, seeing that his Father
grew very old, shewed little regard to him, and
grew so impatient to wear his Crown, that to di∣vert
himself, and not to lie idle, he asked the King
for an Army, to go and conquer a neighbouring
Kingdom, whose Factions invited him. The King
consented, on condition that he would sign an In∣strument
to all the Lords of the Kingdom, signify∣ing,
that if ever the young Prince return'd, and
that they were well assured it was him, by the
Arrow on his Arm, to resign the Crown to him.
The Prince seem'd very ready, being assured of
his Brother's Death, and thinking he hazarded no∣thing,
but at the same time valued himself very
much upon this piece of Compliance. When this
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
was done, and register'd in the proper Courts, and
the Instrument itself laid up in the Treasury, the
King raised a gallant Army, which the Prince, af∣ter
taking his leave of him, put himself at the head
of; and after several Battles, kill'd the King his
Enemy, with his own hand, took the Capital Ci∣ty,
and having left a Garison and Governour in it,
return'd home to his Father, to whom he presented
a young Princess, call'd <HI>Carpillona,</HI> whom he had
taken captive. She was as beautiful as Nature
could form, or Imagination represent. The King,
at the first sight of her, was charm'd, and the
crooked Prince, who had beheld her often, was so
much in love with her, that he could not rest:
She hated him as much as he loved her; for as he
always used her as his Slave, her Heart was so set
against him, and his Manner of Address, that she
did what she possibly could to avoid him.</P>
<P>The King appointed her an Apartment in the
Palace, and Women to wait on her, and was very
sensible of the Misfortunes of so young and beau∣tiful
a Princess. And when the crooked Prince
ask'd his Consent to marry her, he reply'd, he con∣sented,
provided she had no Reluctancy; but that
he thought, when he was nigh her, she seemed
melancholy: “'Tis because she loves me, <HI>answer'd
the Prince,</HI> and dares not discover it, and the Con∣straint
she puts upon herself occasions it; but as
soon as she shall be my Wife, you shall see she
will be pleased.” “I would believe so, <HI>said the
King;</HI> but don't you flatter yourself a little too
much?” The Prince, angry at these his Father's
Doubts, went and told the Princess, that she was
the Cause that the King shew'd a more than usual
Severity in his Behaviour towards him; upon
which he suspected he might love her, and there∣fore
desired her to tell him sincerely, which of
them she approved best of, assuring her, that pro∣vided
she reign'd, he should be content. This he
said only to know her Sentiments, and not with
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
any intent of changing his. The young <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
who was not so experienced, as to know that most
Lovers are Dissemblers, gave into the Deceit, and
said; “I must own, Sir, that was I my own Mi∣stress,
I would neither make choice of the King,
nor yourself: but since my bad Fortune imposes
this hard Necessity upon me, I must tell you, the
King.” “And why?” <HI>answer'd he, with some violence.</HI>
“Because, <HI>added she,</HI> he is more mild than you,
reigns at this time, and will not live so long.”
“Ha, ha! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> you would be left Queen-Dowa∣ger
in a short time, but satisfy yourself you shall
not: The King has no thoughts of you, 'tis only
I that do you that honour, which is much more
than you deserve, for your Ingratitude is im∣mense;
but were it a thousand times more than
it is, you should be my Wife.” The Princess <HI>Car∣pillona</HI>
conceived, but somewhat too late, that it
was dangerous to speak one's Thoughts; and to
make amends for what she had so unwarily said,
reply'd again, “I only used this Stratagem to try
your Sentiments, and I am very glad that you
love me so well, to withstand my affected Seve∣rities.
I esteem you already; endeavour, Sir, to
make me love you.” The Prince bowed, and be∣lieved
what she said to be Truth; Men being ge∣nerally
great Fools when in love, and too apt to
flatter themselves. <HI>Carpillona,</HI> by this means, made
him as mild as a Lamb, and he went away smiling,
and squeezed her Hand so hard, she thought he
had broke it.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, she ran into the King's
Apartment, and casting herself at his feet, said,
“Secure me, Sir, from the greatest of all Misfor∣tunes:
The Prince would marry me, and I must
confess he is odious to me; be not so unjust as
him. My Rank, my Youth, and the Misfortunes
of my Family, deserve the Pity of so great a
King.” “Fair Princess, <HI>said the King,</HI> I am not
surprized that my Son loves you, none that be∣hold
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
you can avoid it; but I shall not forgive
him the want of Respect he owes you.” “Ah!
Sir, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> he looks upon me as his Prisoner,
and treats me like a Slave.” “'Twas with my Ar∣my,
<HI>answer'd the King,</HI> that he has vanquished the
King your Father, and if you are a Captive, you
are mine, and I give you your Liberty; and am
happy, that my advanced Age and grey Hairs se∣cure
me from being your Slave.” The grateful
Princess returned the King a thousand Thanks, and
retired with her Women.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince, having been in∣form'd
of what pass'd, resented it very much; but
his Rage was work'd up to the highest pitch, when
the King forbid him to think any more of the
Princess: telling him, that after all the Services
he had offer'd her, she could not love him. “What,
<HI>answer'd he,</HI> shall I labour all my days to no pur∣pose?
I love not to lose my time after such a
manner.” “I am sorry you should, <HI>said the King,</HI>
but it must not be.” “We shall see that, <HI>said the
Prince, in an insolent manner, and going out of the
Room;</HI> do you think to take my Prisoner from me?
I'll lose my Life first.” “She you call your Pri∣soner,
<HI>said the enraged King,</HI> was mine, and now is
free; I have made her Mistress of herself, and
not to depend on your Caprice.” So smart a Con∣versation
had gone further, had not the Prince re∣tired,
who from that moment conceived a Desire
of taking possession of the Crown and Princess.
He had gained the Hearts of the Soldiers, and ill-designing
People were assisting to his Ambition,
that the King at last was inform'd of his Intentions
of dethroning him; and knowing him to have the
Army on his side, was forced to take the mildest
measures. He sent for the Prince, and said to him,
“Is it possible that you should be so ungrateful, as
to take from me my Crown, to set it upon your
own Head, since you see I am so nigh my End?
Have I not had Misfortunes enough already, by
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
losing a Wife and Son? Indeed I have opposed
your Designs upon the Princess <HI>Carpillona,</HI> but as
much for your sake as hers; for how can you be
happy with a Person that does not love you? But
since you will run the risque of it, I consent you
shall marry her; but let me have some time to
talk to her, to prepare her for it.”</P>
<P>The Prince, who wish'd more for the Princess
than the Kingdom, (for he had that which he late∣ly
conquer'd) told the King, That he was not so
desirous of reigning as he believed, since he had
sign'd an Act, whereby he disinherited himself, in
case his Brother return'd, and should rest satisfy'd,
provided he might marry <HI>Carpillona.</HI> The King em∣braced
him, and went to the Princess, who was
always with her Governess, in cruel Alarms; whom
she had then carried into her Closet, and crying
bitterly, said, “Should it be possible, that after all
the Promises the King has made me, he should
be so cruel as to sacrifice me to his Crook-back'd
Son, the Day of my Nuptials would be the last
I shall breathe; since I am more displeased with
the ill Qualities of his Heart, than the Deformity
of his Body.” “Alas! my dear Princess, <HI>reply'd the
Governess,</HI> you know not undoubtedly, that the
Daughters of the greatest Kings are always made
Victims to the State; they never consult their
Inclination, nor whether the Prince that is to
espouse them be handsome or deform'd.” And just
as <HI>Carpillona</HI> was about to reply, she was told that
the King waited for her in her Chamber. As soon
as she set her Eyes on him, she knew what he
came about, having a great Penetration; and cry'd
out, “Alas! what have you to tell me?” “Fair
Princess, <HI>said he,</HI> look not on your Marriage with
my Son as a Misfortune, but consent willingly:
the Violence that he commits, in regard to your
Sentiments for him, shews but the Ardour of his
own: and if he loved you not, he might find more
Princesses, who would be glad to partake with
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
him a Crown, which he is already in possession
of, besides that which he will have after my
Death. Your Disdain and Contempt have not
been able to dismay him, and you ought to be∣lieve
that he will forget nothing to please you.”
“I flatter'd myself, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> to have found a Pro∣tector
in you, but my Hopes are deceived: you
abandon me, but the just Gods will not.” “If you
knew but all I have done, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to prevent
this Marriage, you would be convinced of my
Friendship.” “Alas! Heaven blessed me with a
Son, who was nursed by his own Mother; but he
was stole away one night, and a Cat put in his
place, which bit the Queen so cruelly, that she
died of it. If that lovely Child had not been ta∣ken
from me, he would have been now a Com∣fort
to me in my old Age; my Subjects would
have feared him, and I might have offer'd you my
Crown with him. This Son would not then have
carried things so high as now, but would have
thought himself happy to live at Court.” “I am
then the Cause of what has befel you, <HI>answer'd
she;</HI> since he would have been so serviceable to
me, look upon me as the guilty Wretch, and
think of punishing me, rather than marrying me.”
“You was not then capable, fair Princess, <HI>said he,</HI>
of doing good or harm; I accuse you not of my
Misfortunes, but if you would not augment them,
prepare yourself to receive my Son: for he is too
powerful here, and may act some tragick Scene.”
The King seeing she return'd no other Answer,
but was all in Tears, left her; and knowing the
Prince would be impatient, went and told him
that the Princess had given her Consent, and bid
him make every thing ready against the Solemniza∣tion
of the Marriage. The Prince, transported
with Joy, thank'd the King, and immediately sent
for Jewellers, and all sorts of Tradesmen, and be∣spoke
all the finest things imaginable; and then
sent several rich Presents of Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
she received with all the Appearance of Joy. Af∣terwards
he paid her a Visit himself, and among
other things, said, “Was you not very much in the
wrong, Madam, to refuse the Honour I would
do you, since I am not disagreeable in my Per∣son,
and the World say I have Wit; besides, you
shall have the finest Diamonds, and wear the rich∣est
Clothes of any Queen in the World.” The
Princess answer'd coldly, That the Misfortunes of
her Family would not permit her to dress like o∣ther
Princesses, and desired him not to make so
great Presents. “You are in the right, <HI>said he,</HI> not
to dress yourself, if I don't give you leave; but
you must think of pleasing me: every thing will
be ready for our Marriage within four days; di∣vert
yourself till then, and command here, since
you are absolute Mistress.” And after that left
her.</P>
<P>No sooner was he gone, but she shut herself up
with her Governess, and told her, she might chuse
whether she would find her the means of escaping,
or those of killing herself on the Wedding-Day.
After the Governess had represented to her the
Impossibility of getting away, and the Weak∣ness
she shew'd, by killing herself, to avoid the
Misfortunes of this Life; she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavour'd to per∣suade
her, that Virtue might contribute to her
Tranquillity, and that without having an intire
Love for the Prince, she might esteem him enough,
to live happy with him. <HI>Carpillona</HI> could not yield
to any of these Remonstrances; but told her, that
till then she made account she had some value for
her, but that now she was sensible how much it
was; and that if all the World should fail her, she
would not be failing to herself; and that dangerous
Diseases must have dangerous Remedies. After this
she open'd the Window, and looking some time
out of it, her Governess, who fear'd she design'd
to throw herself out, fell on her Knees, and look∣ing
tenderly at her, said, “Alas! Madam, what
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
would you have me do? I will obey you, tho
it should cost me my Life.” The Princess em∣braced
her, and desired her to buy her a Shep∣herd's
Dress, and a Cow, and not amuse herself
with persuading her from her Design, since it would
be to no purpose, and only losing time; and not
only that, but to dress up a Figure, and lay it in
her Bed, and say she was ill. “You know, Madam,
<HI>said the poor Governess,</HI> the Dangers to which I ex∣pose
myself; the Prince, without doubt, will
know that I assisted you, he will make use of a
thousand Torments to make me confess: and then
judge if my Love is not great.” The Princess,
very much confounded, made answer, That she
should go away herself two days after, and that it
would be easy to impose upon the World for that
short time. In short, they contrived so well, that
<HI>Carpillo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> had that night both a Shepherdess's Habit
and a Cow, and appear'd as beautiful as the Queen
of Love, when she appear'd with <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas,</HI>
in that Habit, to <HI>Paris</HI> on Mount <HI>Ida.</HI> She set out
by Moon-light, sometimes leading her Cow, and
sometimes getting on her back; and if the least
Breath of Air but gently agitated the Leaves of the
Trees, a Bird flew off her Nest, or any thing stir∣red,
she feared it might be Wolves or Thieves.</P>
<P>Thus she travelled all the night, and would have
done the next day, but that her Cow stopped to
graze in a pleasant Mead; where the Princess, fa∣tigued
with the Weight of her Clothes and Shoes,
sat herself down on the Grass by a purling Stream,
and tied up her Hair, which had got out from un∣der
her Cap, and fell in flowing Rings on her
Shoulders. She looked about, to see if she might
not be observed; but for all her Precaution, she
was surprized by a Lady all in Armour, who, ta∣king
off her Head-piece, which was Gold, adorn'd
with Diamonds, said, “Shepherdess, I am very dry
and weary, will you give me some Milk to quench
my Thirst?” “With all my heart, Madam, <HI>said</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
Carpillona, if I had any thing to put it in.” “I
have here a <HI>China</HI> Dish, <HI>said the armed Lady,</HI> take
that.” But the poor Princess not knowing how to
stroke the Teat; “What, <HI>said the Lady,</HI> is your
Cow dry, or do not you know how to milk her?”
Hereupon the Princess, ashamed to appear so aw∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard
before such an extraordinary Person, fell a
crying, and reply'd; “I must own, Madam, for
the small time I have been a Shepherdess, it has
been my business to feed my Cow; my Mother
does all the rest.” “Then you have a Mother,
<HI>continued the Lady;</HI> and pray what does she do?”
“She is a Farmer,” <HI>said</HI> Carpillona. “What, hard
by?” <HI>said the Lady again.</HI> “Yes,” <HI>reply'd the Princess.</HI>
“Really, <HI>said she,</HI> I have a great affection for her
upon your account, and will go to see her; lead
me to her.” <HI>Carp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llona</HI> was at a stand what Answer
to make; she was unused to lye, and knew not
that she talked to a Fairy. She looked down, her
Colour came into her Face, and at last she said,
“When once I come abroad, I never return till
Night; therefore I desire you, Madam, not to
make my Mother angry with me.” “Ah! Prin∣cess,
Princess, <HI>said the Fairy,</HI> you cannot support
a Lye, nor act the Person you pretend to be,
without my assistance. Here take this Nosegay of
Gilliflowers, and be assured that while you have
it, the crook-back'd Prince, from whom you fly,
will never know you; and remember, when
you come to the great Forest, to inform yourself
of them whereabout the Shepherd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> had
his Abode. Tell him that you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the
Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> who desired him to receive you
as his Daughter. Farewel, <HI>Carpillona,</HI> I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e been
your Friend a long time.” “Alas! Madam, <HI>cry'd
the Princess,</HI> do you love me, and can you abandon
me, when I stand so much in need of your as∣sistance?”
“The Nosegay will not fail you, <HI>reply'd
she;</HI> my time is precious, and I must leave you
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
to compleat your Destiny.” And as she utter'd
these Words, disappear'd.</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> was ready to die with Fear, but re∣covering
herself, continued her Way, though igno∣rant
of the Road that led to the great Forest;
thinking to herself, that this able Fairy would con∣duct
her thither, and always kept the Nosegay
in her Hand, whether she stood still or walk'd:
But at last, her Feet were so chafed and sore,
that she was forced to lie down under the Shade
of some Trees; where she reflected often, and
with no small Uneasiness, on her poor Governess,
of whose Zeal and Fidelity there are but few Ex∣amples.
She dress'd up a Figure, as the Princess
had order'd her, went always very softly into her
Room, as she said, for fear of disturbing her, and
scolded at the least noise that was ever made. The
King, when he was told of the Princess's being
sick, was not at all surprized, attributing it to
her Grief, and the Violence offer'd: But as soon as
the Prince was inform'd of this ill News, his Cha∣grin
was inconceivable; he would see her, but the
Governess, with much ado, prevented him. Then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ask'd that his Physician might; but she told
him, it would be the means to kill her, for she
hated all Physicians and their Remedies: but with∣al,
bid him not be frighten'd, telling him, it was
only a Dizziness of her Head, and that she would
be well, after three or four days rest: By which
means, she put a stop to any farther Importunities.
When one Night, when she was preparing for her
Flight, she heard him knock at the door, as if he
would break it down; and what induced him to
this Violence, was an Information he had had of
the matter from the other Women; who per∣ceiving
the Deceit, and fearing some Punishment
might fall to their share, went and told him pre∣sently.
The Excess of his Rage cannot be ex∣press'd:
He ran to the King, thinking he was not
ignorant of it, but found by the Surprize he read
<PB N="399" REF="200"/>
in his Face, himself to be mistaken As soon as he
saw the poor Governess, he said to her, catching
hold of her Hair; “Give me my <HI>Carpillona,</HI> or I'll
tear out they Heart.” She made no Reply, but
with Tears; and prostrating herself at his Knees,
conjured him, but all in vain, to hear her. He
cast her into a deep Dungeon, and had put her to
death a thousand times, had not the King, who
was as good as his Son was wicked, obliged him to
let her live in that frightful Prison.</P>
<P>This amorous and violent Prince, ordered, that
the Princess should be pursued both by Sea and
Land; and to that end, left the Court himself, and
ran about like a mad Man. When one day, as
<HI>Carpillona</HI> was sat with her Cow under a large
Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, and the Weather being very tempestuous,
she remain'd trembling at the Thunder and Light∣ning,
when the crook-back'd Prince came thi∣ther
with his Attendants for shelter. But, alas!
when she saw him so nigh her, she was more
frighten'd, than at the Thunder and Lightning:
She held her Nosegay of Gilliflowers fast with
both her Hands; and remembring the Fairy, said,
“Abandon me not, charming <HI>Amazona.</HI>” The Prince
casting his Eyes upon her, said, “What can you
be afraid of, poor decrepid old Wretch? Where
would be the hurt if the Thunder should kill
thee, since thou hast one Foot in the Grave al∣ready?”
The young Princess was not less over∣joy'd
than amazed, to hear him call her old:
“Without doubt, <HI>said she to herself,</HI> my Nosegay
works this Wonder.” And that she might have no
farther Conversation with him, she pretended to
be deaf. The Prince, finding she could not hear,
said to his Confidant, who was never from him;
“Now, if my Heart was a little more gay, I could
set this old Creature upon the top of the Rock,
and have the pleasure of seeing her roll down
and break her Neck.” “But, Sir, <HI>reply'd this wic∣ked
Favourite,</HI> to divert you, I'll carry her up by
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
“force, and you shall see her Body bound like a
Ball.” “We have not now time, <HI>said he,</HI> we must
continue our Search after this Ungrate, who
disturbs the Repose of my Life.”</P>
<P>As he made an end of these Words, he clapt
Spurs to his Horse, and rid off. It is easy to judge
of the Joy of the Princess; who did not forget to
thank the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> whose Power she was
then sensible of. She pursued her Journey, and
arrived at the Plain whereon the Shepherds of that
Country built their Huts: which were all very
pretty, each having a Garden and a Spring. The
Valley of <HI>Tempe</HI> could not be more agreeable. The
Shepherdesses were for the most part beautiful,
and the Shepherds neglected nothing to please them.
On all the Trees, Cyphers and Love-Verses were
ingraved. As soon as <HI>Carpillona</HI> appear'd among
them, they left their Flocks; and, prepossessed with
her Beauty and majestick Air, advanc'd towards
her; but what surprized them most, was the Mean∣ness
of her Habit: For though they lived an inno∣cent
and rustick Life, yet they pretended very
much to a neat Adjustment of their Apparel. The
Princes desired them to shew her the Shepherd
<HI>Sublimus</HI>'s Cottage; which they did presently: and
there she found the good old Man sat in the Valley
with his Wife and Daughters, a little Brook run∣ning
by them, which charm'd with its gentle Mur∣murs;
he had some Reeds in his Hands, with
which he was making a little Basket to gather Fruit
in; and his Wife was spinning, while his Daugh∣ters
were angling in the Brook.</P>
<P>When <HI>Carpillona</HI> first accosted them, she was fen∣sible
of so much Respect and Tenderness, that she
was herself surprized; and when they saw her,
they were no less affected. “I am, <HI>said she, sa∣luting
them in an humble manner,</HI> a poor Shepher∣dess,
and come from the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> to offer
you my Service, and hope, that upon her ac∣count
you will receive me.” “Child, <HI>said the
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
King, getting up, and returning her Salute in as civil a
manner;</HI> that great Fairy has reason to believe
that we have a perfect Honour for her; but you
are welcome, if you had no other Recommenda∣tion
but your own Person.” “Come hither, pret∣ty
Maid, <HI>said the Queen, holding out her Hand,</HI> come
and let me kiss you: I conceive a great Kindness
for you, and could wish you would look upon
me as your own Mother, and my Children as
your Sisters.” “Alas! my good Mother, <HI>said the
Princess,</HI> I deserve not that Honour, it is enough
for me to be your Shepherdess, and tend your
Flock.” “No, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> we are are all e∣qual
here, you come with too good a Recom∣mendation
for us to make any difference between
you and our Children; sit down by us, and let
your Cow feed with our Sheep.” She made some
difficulty, persisting in what she told them at first,
that she was come only to be their Servant; but
would have been very much embarass'd if they had
taken her at her word: for indeed, by her Looks,
she seem'd to be made more to command than to
obey; and it might be thought, that so great a
Fairy would not protect an ordinary Person.</P>
<P>The King and Queen look'd upon her with an
Amazement mix'd with Admiration, which they
could not comprehend: They ask'd her if she came
a great way? she said, yes; and then, if she had a
Father and Mother? to which she said, no: and
answer'd all their other Questions with Mono∣syllables,
as much as her Respect would allow her
to do. “What is your Name, <HI>said the Queen?”
“Carpillona, reply'd she.</HI>” “The Name, <HI>said the King,</HI>
is very odd; and, unless some Adventure gives
room for it, it is very rare.” She made no an∣swer,
but took up one of the Queen's Spindles, to
wind off the Thred: But when she drew off her
Gloves, the King and Queen, who cast their Eyes
upon her Hands, thought them to be Snow, form'd
in that Shape; and, to penetrate farther into her▪
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
Condition, said; “<HI>Carpillona</HI> your Clothes are too
hot for the Climate we live in, and your Shoes
too heavy and clumsy for so young a Damsel;
you must be dress'd after our manner.” “My
Clothes, Mother, <HI>answer'd she,</HI> are such as they
wear in my Country; but I'll put on what you
please to order me.” They admir'd her Obedi∣ence,
and above all, the Air of Modesty that ap∣pear'd
in her Eyes and all her Actions; but, it be∣ing
Supper-time, they got up, and went all into
the House, where they intended to dress the Fish
that the two Princess's had caught, and some fresh
Eggs, and to make the rest up with Milk and
Fruit. “I am surprized, <HI>said the King,</HI> that my Son
is not yet come home; his Eagerness after Sport
carries him too far; and I am always in fear, lest
some Accident should befall him.” “My Fears
are no less than yours, <HI>said the Queen;</HI> but, if you
please, we will not sup till he comes.” No, <HI>said
the King,</HI> let him mind his time better; on the
contrary, I desire you, when he comes, not to speak
to him, but that every one give him a cold Recep∣tion.”
“You know his Good-nature, <HI>said the Queen,</HI>
and he will be so much troubled, that he will
fall sick.” “I can't help that, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> he
must be corrected.” After this Discourse, they sat
to Supper; but before they had quite done, the
young Prince came in, with a wild Roe on his
Shoulders, his Hair all wet with Sweat, and
his Face cover'd with Dust; he leant on a little
Lance he generally carried along with him; his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow hung on one side, and his Quiver of Arrows
on the other. In this Condition, there appear'd
something so noble and lofty in his Countenance
and Mien, that none could look upon him without
Attention and Respect: “Mother, <HI>said he, addres∣sing
himself to the Queen,</HI> my Desire to bring you
this Roe, has made me run all day over the Moun∣tains
and Plains.” “Son, <HI>said the King gravely,</HI>
you endeavour more to make us uneasy, than to
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
please us; you know how much I have said to
you, on your violent Desire of Sport: but you
are resolv'd to take no notice of it.” The Prince
blush'd, and what vex'd him most, was, to see a
Person there, who did not belong to the Family.
He reply'd, that another time he would come soon∣er;
or, that if he did not approve of it, he would not
go at all. “That's enough, <HI>said the Queen, who lo∣ved
him tenderly;</HI> I thank you, Child, for your
Present: Come and sit by me, and eat your Sup∣per,
for to be sure, you must be hungry.” The
Prince was somewhat disorder'd at the serious
Air the King spoke to him in, and durst not
look up; for though he was intrepid in all Dan∣gers,
he was of a docible Temper, and stood
in great awe, where his Duty required it of
him. But at last, he recover'd out of his Con∣fusion,
sat down by the Queen, and cast his Eyes
on <HI>Carpillona,</HI> who had not stay'd so long to look at
him: but as soon as their Eyes met, their Hearts
were so agitated, that they knew not what to at∣tribute
this Disorder to. The Princess blush'd, and
the Prince kept his Eyes stedfast upon her; till at
last, she raising her's again with a pleasing Soft∣ness,
they continued looking at each other with a
mutual Surprize, thinking nothing could equal what
they beheld. “Is it possible, <HI>said the Princess to her∣self,</HI>
that, of so many Persons I have seen at Court,
“none should come nigh to this young Shepherd?”
“How comes it, <HI>thought he to himself,</HI> that this ad∣mirable
Maid should be but a poor Shepherdess!
Ah! that I was but a King, to place her on a
Throne, and to make her as much the Mistress
of my Empire as she is of my Heart.” In musing
after this manner, he eat nothing. The Queen,
who thought it owing to the ill Reception he met
with, tired herself with inviting and caressing him,
and brought out the finest Fruits she had. He de∣sired
<HI>Carpillona</HI> to taste of them. She thank'd him,
and told him, without thinking on the Hand that
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
gave them, that she had done nothing but eat, and
cared for no more. Upon which, he left them
coldly upon the Table. The Queen took not the
least notice of all this; but the eldest Princess, who
had no small esteem for him, and who perhaps
might have loved him very well, but for the Dif∣ference
she thought between them, observed all
that past with some Jealousy.</P>
<P>After Supper, the King and Queen retired, and
the Princesses, according to their usual Custom,
did whatever was to be done in the House: One
milk'd the Cows, the other press'd the Cheese,
<HI>&amp;c. Carpillona</HI> busied herself after their Example
to work; but she was so little us'd to it, that she
did nothing to the purpose: insomuch, that the
two Princesses call'd her the pretty unhandy Maid.
The amorous Prince help'd her in every thing; he
went to the Spring with her, carried her Pail,
drew the Water, and brought it back on his shoul∣ders,
and would not suffer her to carry any thing.
“What do you mean, Shepherd, <HI>said she to him;</HI>
must I act the fine Lady? I that have been used
all my Life to work? Am I to live here in Idle∣ness?”
“You shall do what you please, lovely
Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> but deny me not the plea∣sure
of accepting my small Assistance in these Oc∣casions.”
Afterwards, they both return'd, though
sooner than he desired; for though he durst not
yet hardly speak to her, nevertheless, he was o∣verjoy'd
to be with her. They both pass'd the
Night in an Uneasiness which neither of them,
through their little Experience, could guess the
Cause of. The Prince waited impatiently for day,
to see the Shepherdess again; and she was in as
much dread. The new Trouble the Sight of him
put her into, somewhat diverted her other Dis∣pleasures;
and she thought so much of him, that
she almost forgot the crook-back'd Prince. “Why,
<HI>said she,</HI> has blind Fortune bestow'd so many Gra∣ces,
such a Mein, and such Charms on a young
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
Shepherd, who is destin'd only to feed his Flock;
and so much Malice and Deformity on a Prince
appointed to rule a flourishing Nation?”</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> never had the Curiosity to view herself,
since her Metamorphosis from a Princess into a
Shepherdess; but then a certain Desire of pleasing,
made her seek after a Glass. She was not long
before she found that of the Princess; but when
she saw herself, she was quite confounded. “What
a Figure's here, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> what am I like? It is
impossible that I should endure to be buried long
in this coarse Stuff.” Then she wash'd her Face
and Hands, and went to the Queen, and fal∣ling
on her Knees, presented her with a fine Dia∣mond
Ring, which was part of the Jewels she
brought along with her. “Mother, I found this
Ring some time since, but know not the value of
it, but believe it may be worth some Money; I beg
you would accept of it, as a proof of my Acknow∣ledgment
for your Charity towards me; and like∣wise
I desire you to buy me a Habit, and Linen,
that I may appear like the other Shepherdesses
of this Country.” The Queen was very much
surprized to see so noble a Ring, and told her that
she would not take it, but would keep it for her,
and that she would send to a little Town that was
hard by, for a nice Country Habit, Shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> com∣pleat.</P>
<P>When <HI>Carpillona</HI> was thus dress'd, she appear'd
more charming than <HI>Aurora.</HI> The Prince neglected
nothing on his part, but adorn'd his Hat, Scrip, and
Crook with Flowers, and carried her a Nose-gay,
which he presented with all the fear of a Lover,
and which she receiv'd with some Consternation,
the she wanted no Presence of Mind nor Wit.
When she was with him, she hardly ever spoke
but was always very thoughtful, as was he himself.
When he went a hunting, instead of pursuing his
Game, whenever he found a place proper to enter∣tain
himself with the thoughts of his beloved. <HI>Car∣pillona,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
he would stop all on a sudden, and in that
solitary Retirement make Verses and Songs on his
Shepherdess; often talking to the Rocks, Woods,
and Birds: and in short, he lost all that Gaiety of
Temper which made him seek after the Company
of the young Shepherds. But as it is hard to love,
and not fear what we love; he dreaded so much
the making his Shepherdess angry by declaring him∣self,
that he durst scarce ever speak to her: and
tho she observed very well, that he preferred her
before all others, and that Preference ought to
assure her of his Sentiments; yet she could not but
be in some pain for his Silence. Sometimes she
would be overjoy'd, and would say to herself, “If
he really does love me, how shall I receive the
declaration of his Passion? If I should be angry, I
perhaps, shall be the cause of his Death; and if I
be not, I shall die myself with Shame and Grief.
What, shall I, who am born a Princess, hearken
to a poor Shepherd? Ah! too base Weakness, I
shall never consent. My Heart ought not to
change with my Apparel; I have but too much
to reproach myself with, since I have been here.”
As the Prince had a thousand natural Charms in
his Voice, and perhaps had he not sung so well, the
Princess prepossess'd in his favour, would have
liked to hear him; she would often engage him
to sing: and the Songs he made choice of, had al∣ways
something so tender and engaging in them,
that she could not forbear expressing a pleasure,
which inspired him with the more Boldness; and
one day he went to the River-side, to a place sha∣ded
by Osiers and Willows, and whither he knew
that <HI>Carpillona</HI> led her Flock every day; and with a
Nail writ on the Bark of one of the Trees these
Lines:
<Q><PB N="207" REF="208"/>
<L>In this Retreat, in vain do I</L>
<L>Find Peace and Pleasure reign;</L>
<L>Where Love the freedom of a Sigh</L>
<L>Denies, to ease my Pain.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Princess surprized him just as he had made
an end; he affected to seem confounded, and after
some Moments of Silence, said to her, “You see an
unhappy Shepherd, who complains to the most
insensible things, when he ought to complain to
none but you.” She made no answer, but casting
down her eyes, gave him the opportunity he wan∣ted
to declare his Sentiments. While he was speak∣ing,
her Thoughts were wholly taken up how she
ought to take what she heard from a Mouth that
was not indifferent to her; but her Inclination en∣gaged
her to excuse him. “He is ignorant, <HI>said she
to herself,</HI> of my Birth; therefore his Temerity is
pardonable: he loves me, and thinks me his Equal;
but should he know my Rank, will not the Gods
themselves, who are so much above us, will not
they accept of the Hearts of Mortals? Are they
angry because they are loved? Well, Shepherd,
<HI>said she, turning herself towards him,</HI> I pity you; and
that is all I can do for you: I will not love; I
have Misfortunes enough already. Alas! what
would be my Condition, if, to augment my Ca∣lamities,
my days should be burden'd with an
Engagement?” “Ah! Shepherdess, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> say ra∣ther,
that if you have any Troubles, nothing is
more capable to sweeten them. I will partake
of all of them; my Study shall be to please you;
you may repose on me the care of your Flock.”
“I wish to Heaven▪ <HI>said she,</HI> that I had no other
reason to be uneasy.” “What others can you
have, <HI>said he, with an eager Concern,</HI> being so beau∣tiful,
so young, so free from Ambition, and so
little versed with the vain Grandeurs of a Court?
But without doubt, you love here some happy
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
Rival, which renders you inexorable towards me▪”
pronouncing these last Words, he chang'd Counte∣nance,
became melancholy, and was cruelly tor∣mented
with this Thought. “I will there agree
with you, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> you have a Rival; but then
he is one hated and abhorr'd: you had never
seen me, but that the Necessity of avoiding his
pressing Instances obliged me to fly from him.”
“Perhaps, Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> you will fly from
me too; for if you hated him only because he
loved you, I am sure, I am to be hated the most
of all Men.” “Whether it be, <HI>replyed she,</HI> that I
don't believe him, or that I look more favourably
upon you, I am sensible I shall not fly from you
as I have done from him.” The Shepherd was
transported with Joy at these obliging Words, and
from that day neglected no Opportunity to please
the Princess.</P>
<P>Every day he gather'd the finest Flowers to make
Garlands for her, and adorn'd her Crook with Rib∣bands.
He never would suffer her to be exposed to
the Sun; but whenever she came along the River∣side
with her Flock, he would cut down Branches
of Trees, and form an Arbour wherever there was
a pleasant Situation. All the Trees thereabouts
bore her Cyphers, and Verses in praise of her
Beauty. The young Princess saw all these Testi∣monies
of the Shepherd's Passion; she loved se∣cretly,
but durst never examine her Heart, for fear
of finding there Sentiments too tender. The young
Shepherd's Love for his Shepherdess, could not
long be kept secret, but was discover'd, as well as
applauded, by every one; for who could find fault
where all was Love? All who saw them, said, they
were born for each other, that they were both
perfect Beauties, that it was the Work of the Gods,
that Fortune made their Country so happy, and
that they must neglect nothing to detain them.
<HI>Carpillona</HI> felt a secret Joy to hear the publick Prai∣ses
in favour of a Swain she thought so amiable;
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
but then thinking of the difference that was be∣tween
them, she was somewhat chagrin'd, but pur∣posed
not to discover who she was, that she might
indulge her Heart the more. The King and Queen,
who were extremely fond of them both, were no
ways displeased at this growing Passion; they look∣ed
on the Prince as their own Son, and were no
less taken with the Perfections of the Shepherdess.
Was she not sent by <HI>Amazona,</HI> said they, who fought
the Centaur? Without doubt, that wise Fairy has
destin'd them for each other; therefore we must
wait her Orders.</P>
<P>Things were in this condition; the Prince com∣plain'd
always of <HI>Carpillona</HI>'s Indifference, because
she carefully conceal'd her Sentiments from him;
when being one day out a hunting, he could not
avoid a furious Bear that came suddenly out of the
Hollow of a Rock, and had devour'd him, had not
his Courage been seconded by his Activity. After
having struggled a long time upon the top of the
Mountain, they both at last rolled down together.
<HI>Carpillona</HI> at that very time was stopt with her Com∣panions
in that place, yet could not see what pass'd
on the top of the Hill. But what a Condition were
they all in, when they saw a Man and a Bear
tumbling down together? The Princess soon knew
her Shepherd, and sent out Crys of Fear and Grief;
all the Shepherdesses ran away: but Love redoub∣ling
the Princess's Courage, she was so bold as to
run the Iron of her Crook down into the terrible
Monster's Throat; and to give her Lover some
assistance, who when he saw her, for fear she might
partake of his danger, raised his Courage to such an
height, that he no longer thought of preserving his
own Life, but only to secure hers; and indeed
kill'd his Enemy just at her feet: at the same time
he fell down half dead with the loss of Blood from
two Wounds he receiv'd.</P>
<P>How cruel a sight was it for her to see his Clothes
all dyed with Blood! She could not speak; her
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
Face was drowned in Tears; she laid his Head in
her Lap, and all on a sudden breaking Silence, said,
“Shepherd, if you die, I'll die with you: In vain
have I conceal'd my secret Thoughts; know then
now, that my Life is attach'd to yours.” “What
can I wish for more, fair Shepherdess? <HI>cry'd he in
a faint Voice:</HI> whatever befals me, my Fate now
will always be happy.”</P>
<P>By this time the Shepherdesses who fled, return∣ed
with several Shepherds, and assisted the Prince
and the Princess, who by that time was in as bad
a condition: but while they were cutting down
the Branches of Trees to make a sort of Litter for
them, the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> appear'd among them.
“Be not concern'd, <HI>said she,</HI> let me touch the young
Shepherd.” Then taking him by the hand, and
putting her golden Cask upon his Head, she said,
“Dear Shepherd, I forbid thee from being sick.”
Hereupon he soon got up, and the Visor of the
Cask being up, there appear'd a martial Air in his
Face; and his Eyes, which were bright and lively,
answer'd the hopes which the Fairy conceiv'd. He
was amazed at the Manner of his Cure, and the
Majesty that appear'd throughout her whole Per∣son;
and transported with Admiration, Joy, and
Acknowledgment, cast himself at her feet: “Great
Queen, <HI>said he,</HI> I was dangerously wounded; one
Glance from your Eyes, and one Word from your
Mouth, has cured me. But, alas! I have a Wound
in my Heart that I will not be cured of; vouchsafe
only to assuage the Pain, and mend my Fortune,
since I cannot partake it, such as it is, with this
fair Shepherdess.” The Princess blush'd to hear
him speak after this manner; she knew that the
Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> was not ignorant who she was, and
fear'd lest she should blame her for giving hopes to
a Lover so much below her; insomuch that she
durst not look up: but the Sighs that escaped her
Breast, raised some pity in that of the Fairy's. “<HI>Car∣pillona,
said she,</HI> this Shepherd is not unworthy
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
your Esteem; and you, Shepherd, who desire
so much the Change of your Condition, assure
yourself of a most illustrious Fate.” And then
she disappear'd. The Shepherds and Shepherdesses
conducted them back in Triumph to their Hamlet,
placing the two Lovers in the midst of them, and
crowned them with Flowers as a Token of the
Victory they had gain'd over the terrible Bear,
which they brought after them, singing Verses on
the Tenderness of <HI>Carpillona</HI> to the Prince.</P>
<P>When they came to the Shepherd <HI>Sublimus,</HI> they
told him all that had happen'd; with what Courage
the Shepherd had defended himself against the Bear,
and with what Generosity the Shepherdess had
assisted him; and in short, what the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI>
had done. The King, overjoy'd at this relation,
ran to acquaint the Queen of it. “Without doubt,
<HI>said he,</HI> this Boy and Girl are above the Vulgar;
their eminent Perfections, their Beauty, and the
Care of the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> shews something
extraordinary.” This discourse put the Queen in
mind of the Diamond-Ring <HI>Carpillona</HI> had given her.
“I have always forgot, <HI>said she,</HI> to shew you a
Ring which this young Shepherdess put into my
hands with an uncommon Air of Grandeur, desi∣ring
me to accept of it, and to furnish her for it
with such Clothes as they wear in this Country.”
“Is the Stone fine? <HI>replyed the King.</HI>” “I never look'd
much at it, <HI>said the Queen,</HI> but here it is;” and
presented it to him. No sooner had he fix'd his
eyes on it, but he cry'd out, “Ye Gods! what is
this I behold?” “What do you not know a Pre∣sent
which I received from your hands?” At the
same time he touch'd a little Spring, the Diamond
flew up, and the Queen saw her own Picture
which she had drawn to give the King; and which
she had tied about her little Daughter's Neck for
her to play with, when she nursed her in the
Tower. “Alas! my Dear, <HI>said she,</HI> what strange
Adventure is this! it renews all my Griefs▪ but
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
let us talk to the Shepherdess, and endeavour to
learn more.” Upon this she call'd <HI>Carpillona,</HI> and
said, “I have waited till now, Child, for a Con∣fession
from you; which would have given much
more pleasure, had it come from you without
being press'd to it: but since you still continue to
conceal from us who you are, it is proper that
we inform you that we know, and that the Ring
you gave me has discover'd this Riddle.” “Alas!
Mother, <HI>reply'd the Princess, falling on her Knees by
her,</HI> it was not for want of Confidence that I con∣ceal'd
my Rank from you, but that I thought it
might be a trouble to you to see a Princess redu∣ced
to my Condition.”</P>
<P>“My Father was King of the <HI>Peaceable Islands;</HI> but
his Reign being disturbed by an Usurper, he, and
my Mother, were both confined in a strong Tow∣er.
After three Years Imprisonment, they found
the means, by the assistance of one of their Guard,
and the favour of the Night, to escape. They let
me down in a Basket; but the Cord breaking,
I fell into the Lake which surrounded the Castle,
where I was taken up by some Fishermen, who
just then were drawing in their Nets, which they
had thrown out for some Carp, which the Moat
was well stored with. But alas! how were the
Fishermen deceived in their Hopes! for by my
weight they were in expectation of a good
Draught. When they first saw me, they thought
of throwing me in again; but at last they resol∣ved
to leave me in the Net, and carry me to the
Tyrant; who, being informed of the flight of my
Family, knew me to be an unhappy destitute
Princess. His Wife, who had no Children, pity∣ing,
and having some Inclination for me, took
me, and brought me up under the Name of <HI>Car∣pillona,</HI>
perhaps with a design that I might have
no notion of my Birth; but my Heart has always
told me who I am: and it is sometimes a Misfor∣tune
to have Sentiments so little conformable to
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
one's Fortune. But as the greatest Prosperity is
not to be depended on; a neighbouring Prince,
who was crooked, and went by the Name of the
<HI>Humpback's Prince,</HI> coming at the head of a gal∣lant
Army, deprived the Usurper of my Father's
Crown of his ill-gotten Power. This Change
of the Tyrant's Fortune render'd mine still worse;
the Conqueror took me with him as the greatest
Ornament of his Triumph, and determined to
marry me, whether I consented or not. In this
Extremity I betook myself to flight, dress'd like a
Shepherdess, and leading a Cow; and was met by the
Prince, who undoubtedly had known me again, if
the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> had not generously given me a
Nose-gay of Gilliflowers to secure me from my
Enemies. Neither, my good Mother, <HI>continued the
Princess,</HI> did she do a less charitable Action in re∣commending
me to you; and if I declared not my
Rank sooner, it was not through distrust, but
only to spare your Grief. Not, <HI>pursued she,</HI> that
I complain, for I never knew any Tranquillity
till the day I was received by you; and I must
own, that a Country-Life is so sweet and innocent,
that I prefer it before that of a Court.”</P>
<P>As she spoke with great earnestness, she observ'd
not that the Queen melted into Tears, and that the
King's Eyes water'd; but she had no sooner done,
than they both strove to clasp her in their Arms,
where they held her a long time without being
able to pronounce one Word. She melted, and
cry'd after their example; and it is hard to express
the agreeable Trouble these three illustrious Per∣sons
were in. At last, the Queen, making an Effort
upon herself, said, “Is it possible, my dear Child,
that after all my Sorrow for thy fatal loss, Heaven
should restore thee to thy Mother, to comfort her
in her Misfortunes. Behold, my Child, the Breast
that suckled thee in thy tender Youth! Behold
the King thy Father, the Author of thy Days!
With what Transports shall we solemnize the
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
Return of a Child which Heaven in its Anger
deprived us of?” “and I, illustrious Mother and
Queen, <HI>cry'd the Princess,</HI> (casting herself at her
Feet) by what Expressions and Actions shall I
make you both understand the Love and Respect
I owe you, since I find you the dear Sanctuary
to my Misfortunes, when I durst not flatter my∣self
with ever seeing you again?” Then they all
renew'd their Caresses, and thus some Hours glided
away. <HI>Carpillona</HI> after this retired, having first been
forbid by her Father and Mother to speak of what
had passed.</P>
<P>The Princess, in regard to indifferent Persons,
observed their Commands punctually, but could not
keep the Secret from her young Shepherd; so hard
a thing it is to conceal any thing from a Person
we love. She reproached herself a thousand times
for not having discover'd her Birth to him. “How
great would his Obligation have been, <HI>said she,</HI>
if he had known, that being born to a Throne,
I should stoop so low as to him: But alas! what
difference does Love make between a Scepter and
a Crook? Can this chimerical Grandeur, which
we boast so much of, can it satisfy our Souls?
No, Virtue alone has there a Right; it sets us
above a Crown, and can free us from it: The
Shepherd that loves me, is wise, witty, and amia∣ble;
what can a Prince be more?” As she aban∣don'd
herself to these Reflections, she saw him at
her feet, he having follow'd her to the River-side;
and was presented by him with a Garland of Flow∣ers,
the Variety of which was charming. “From
whence come you, fair Shepherdess, <HI>said he,</HI> I
have been seeking you some hours, and have
waited some others with impatience?” “Shepherd,
<HI>said she,</HI> I have been taken up with a very sur∣prizing
Adventure, and reproach myself for being
so long silent; but remember, that this Mark of
my Confidence requires an eternal Secrecy. I
am a Princess, my Father was a King, whom I
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
find in the Person of the Shepherd <HI>Sublimus.</HI>” The
Prince was so confounded and surprized at this
News, that he had not power to interrupt her, tho
she related the History of her Life with all ima∣ginable
Bounty: So great were his Fears, lest this
wise Shepherd, since he was a King, should refuse
him his Daughter; or that she, reflecting on the
Difference between a great Princess and himself,
should fall off some day from those Testimonies of
Kindness she had given him. “Ah! Madam, <HI>said
the melancholy Prince,</HI> I am a lost Man, I must re∣nounce
this Life: You are born to a Crown, and
have found your Father and Mother. For my
part, I am an unhappy Wretch, that knows nei∣ther
his Country or Relations; an Eagle was my
Nurse, and her Nest my Cradle: if you have had
some favourable regard to me, it will be return'd
you.” The Princess mused a moment or two, and
without returning any Answer to what he said,
took her Bodkin out of her Hair, and writ on the
Bark of a Tree:
<Q>Equal Passion can your Heart return?</Q></P>
<P>The Prince writ immediately this Verse:
<Q>A thousand times more ardently I burn.</Q></P>
<P>The Princess writ under it:
<Q><L>Thank Fortune for this lucky Main,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Prince, transported with Joy, cast himself
at her feet, and taking one of her hands, said,
“Adorable Princess, you flatter my afflicted Heart,
and by this new Bounty preserve my Life; re∣member
what you have writ in my favour.” “I am
not capable of forgetting, <HI>said she, with a gracious
A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r;</HI> depend upon my Heart, it is more interested
in your behalf than my own.” Their Conversa∣tion,
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
without doubt, had been longer, had they
had more time; but they were then obliged to ga∣ther
up their Flocks, and return home.</P>
<P>All this time the King and Queen conferred to∣gether
upon <HI>Carpillona</HI>'s Behaviour towards the young
Shepherd. While she was unknown to them, they
approved of those growing Flames, that kindled in
their Souls; the perfect Beauty wherewith Heaven
had endow'd them, the Wit and Graces which ac∣companied
all their Actions, made them desire an
everlasting Union: But when they looked upon her
with a different eye, as their own Daughter, and
on the Shepherd as an unfortunate Babe, exposed
to the Fury of the wild Beasts; they resolved to
tell <HI>Carpillona,</HI> that she should not entertain him
any more with flattering Hopes, but should declare
to him, that she would not settle in that Country.
After this Determination of theirs, the Queen cal∣led
her in, and with a great deal of Tenderness
told her all that had pass'd: but what words were
capable to calm so violent a Disorder? The young
Princess strove in vain to constrain herself, her Face
was sometimes as red as Scarlet, and another while
as pale as Death; and the languishing of her Eyes
discover'd but too much the State she was in. Ah!
how did she then repent her Confession? Never∣theless,
she assured her Mother with great Submis∣sion,
that she would obey her Commands; and
then retiring, had much to do to get to her Bed,
where bursting into Tears, she passed the Night in
uttering her Complaints and Regrets.</P>
<P>The next Morning she arose, to lead her Flock
to feed; but instead of going towards the River,
went directly to a Wood, where lying down upon
the Grass, and leaning upon her Elbow, she fell
into a deep musing: The Prince, who could not
be quiet, where she was not present, sought all a∣bout
for her, and finding her, presented himself to
her sight; who no sooner saw him, but she shriek'd
out, as if she had been surprized, and rising with
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
precipitation, left him without looking once at
him. He stood some time like one Thunder-struck
at so unusual a Behaviour; but recovering himself,
follow'd her, and stopping her, said, “What, Shep∣herdess,
would you, in giving me Death, deprive
yourself of the pleasure of seeing me expire
before your Eyes? You have changed in re∣gard
to your Shepherd, and no longer remember
what you promised but yesterday.” “Alas! <HI>said
sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, casting her Eyes melancholily upon him,</HI> what Crime
do you accuse me of? I am miserable, and tied
down by Commands, which I cannot evade: Pity
me, and leave me wherever you see me.” “Must
I, <HI>cry'd he, folding his Arms in an Air of Despair,</HI> must
I fly you, Divine Princess? and can so cruel an
Order, and so little deserved, be pronounced by
you yourself? What would you have become of
me? And can that flattering Hope, to which you
was so willing that I should abandon myself, ex∣tinguish,
and I live?” At these words <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
whose Grief was not less violent than her Lover's,
fell speechless, and void of Life, at his feet; at
which sight he was agitated with a thousand diffe∣rent
Thoughts, but the Condition his beloved Mi∣stress
was in, told him, that her Heart had no part
in the Orders she then gave him, which diminish'd
in some measure his Sorrows: However, he lost
not a moment to assist her; a Spring, which ran
softly along the Grass, afforded him Water to throw
in her Face, and some <HI>Cupids,</HI> who were hid behind
a Bush, have told their Comrades since, that he
was so bold as to steal a Kiss. Whether it be true
or not, the charming Shepherdess presently open'd
her Eyes, and pushing her lovely Shepherd from
her, said, “Fly and be gone, how angry will my
Mother be, if she should come?” “What, <HI>said he,</HI>
must I leave you then, to be devoured by Wolves
and Bears; or during a long Swoon, to be stung
in this solitary Place by some Serpent or Aspick.”
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
“Yes, <HI>said she,</HI> we must hazard all, rather than dis∣please
the Queen.”</P>
<P>During this Conversation, in which their tender
Looks had no small share; the Fairy, their Pro∣rectrix,
appear'd in the King's Chamber, arm'd as
before, and addressing herself to the Queen, said,
“You are no ways grateful, Madam, for the Pre∣sent
I made you of your Daughter, who would
have been drowned in the Net but for me, since
you are upon the point of killing with Grief the
young Shepherd (with whom I trusted you:)
Think not of the Difference that may be between
him and <HI>Carpillona,</HI> it is time to unite them; think,
illustrious <HI>Sublimus, said she to the King,</HI> of their
Marriage, I wish it, and you will have no reason
to repent it.” After these words, without waiting
for an Answer, she left them nothing remaining to
their View, but long Rays of Light, like those of
the Sun.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were equally surprized,
and both felt a secret Joy, that the Fairy's Com∣mands
were so positive. “It is no longer to be
doubted, <HI>said the King,</HI> but that this unknown
Shepherd is of a Birth agreeable to <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
since their Protectrix has too much Justice to u∣nite
two Persons of unequal Rank. 'Twas she
that saved our Child in the Lake, where she must
inevitably have perish'd. How have we deserved
her Protection?” “I have often heard say, <HI>reply'd
the Queen,</HI> that there are good and ill Fairies, and
that they have a Friendship or an Aversion to Fa∣milies,
according to their Genius, and certainly
<HI>Amazona</HI> is favourable to us.” As they were talk∣ing
in this manner, the Princess came in, a droop∣ing
languishing Air appearing in her Face. The
Prince, who durst not follow her, but at a distance,
came some time after; but so great Melancholy
hung upon him, that it was sufficient to look at
him, to know all that pass'd in his Soul: and du∣ring
Dinner-time these two poor Lovers, who used
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
to make all the Mirth, open'd not their Mouths,
nor durst they so much as look at one another.
When the Cloth was taken away, the King went
into his little Garden, and bid the Shepherd follow
him. At this Order he turn'd pale, an extraordi∣nary
shivering glided thro his Veins, and <HI>Carpillona</HI>
was afraid her Father was going to send him away;
so dreadful were both their Apprehensions. <HI>Sub∣limus</HI>
went into a green Arbour, where sitting
down, and looking upon the Prince, he said, “Son,
you know with what Love I have brought you
up; I have always regarded you as a Present made
me by the Gods, to support and comfort me in
my old Age: but a greater Proof of my Friend∣ship
to you, is the Choice I make of you for my
Daughter <HI>Carpillona,</HI> the Loss of whom you have
heard me so often deplore; but that same Provi∣dence
that restored her to me, has ordained her
for you.” “Ah! Father, <HI>cry'd the Prince, casting him∣self
at his feet,</HI> dare I flatter myself with what I
hear? Am I so happy as to be your Choice, or
is this only to know my Sentiments for that beau∣tiful
Shepherdess?” “No, my dear Son, <HI>said the
King,</HI> float no longer thus between Hope and Fear;
I am resolved to celebrate your Nuptials within a
few days.” “You heap too many Obligations up∣on
me, <HI>reply'd the Prince, embracing his Knees;</HI> and
if I do not sufficiently explain my Acknowledg∣ments,
it proceeds from the Excess of Joy.” The
King made him rise, profess'd great Value and
Friendship for him; and tho he did not acquaint
him with the Greatness of his Rank, he said enough
to let him know, that his Birth was much above
his present Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> could not be easy, but must follow them
into the Garden, where she observed all that pass'd
from behind some Trees; and seeing her Lover at
her Father's feet, she believed he might be intreat∣ing
him not to condemn him to a cruel Banishment;
and desiring to know no more, fled into the For∣rest,
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
running like a Fawn before the Dogs, fearing
neither the Fierceness of the wild Beasts, nor the
Thorns or Briars, which tore her on all sides. The
Echoes repeated her Complaints, and she<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seem'd to
seek nothing but Death; in the mean time her
Shepherd, impatient to tell her the joyful News,
made all imaginable haste to follow her, and find
her out. “Where are you, my Shepherdess, <HI>cry'd
he,</HI> where are you, my lovely <HI>Carpillona;</HI> if you
hear me, fly me not, we shall both be happy.”
In pronouncing these words, he perceived her, sur∣rounded
in the bottom of a Vale by several Hunt∣ers,
who were endeavouring to put her behind a
little hump-back'd Man: at this sight, and the Cries
of his Mistress, who wanted assistance, he flew like
an Arrow out of a Bow, and having no other Arms
but his Sling, he let fly a Stone, which hit the
crooked Prince full on his Forehead, and knock'd
him off his Horse, who brought the Princess down
with him. By that time the Prince came to them
himself, and endeavour'd to defend his dear Shep∣herdess
against those Ravishers; but all his Resist∣ance
was to no purpose, they took him as well as
her, and had sacrificed him to their Rage, had not
the crook-back'd Prince made a sign to them to
save him, that he might put him to the most cruel
Torments: So that they then only contented them∣selves
with binding him and the Princess, and in
such a manner, that they could talk to one another;
and after having made a sort of a Litter to carry
their wounded Prince in, went away, without be∣ing
seen by any of the Shepherds, who might have
given <HI>Sublimus</HI> an account of the Misfortune of
these young Lovers. Notwithstanding, we may ea∣sily
imagine his and the Queen's Concern, when
Night came, and they saw them not; who, with
all the Shepherds of that Neighbourhood, sought
several days for them.</P>
<P>Now before I proceed any further, it will not
be amiss to say, that the crooked Prince had not
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
forgot <HI>Carpillona,</HI> and that when he was not em∣ploy'd
with the Affairs of State, or acting some
horrid Murder, he used to go a Hunting, and stay
out for seven or eight days. It was at one of these
long Huntings that he saw the Princess cross a
Path; and the Liveliness of her Grief made her
give so little attention to what might befal her,
that she took not the Nosegay of Gilliflowers
with her: so that he knew her as soon as he saw
her.</P>
<P>But to return to the Shepherd and Shepherdess:
The Shepherd cry'd out, “Alas! this is the greatest
of all Misfortunes; we were just upon the point
of being united together.” And then he told her
all that pass'd between <HI>Sublimus</HI> and him. It is no
hard matter to comprehend the Regret of <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
who bursting forth afresh into Tears, said, “I shall
cost you your Life, I lead you, for whom I
would spill the last Drop of my Blood to a hor∣rid
Punishment: I am the Cause of this Misfor∣tune,
and, thro my own Imprudence, have fallen
into the inhuman hands of my most cruel Perse∣cutor.”</P>
<P>With this kind of Discourse they entertain'd one
another till they arrived at the Capital City, where
the good old King, the Father of this wicked and
crooked Prince, was inform'd that his Son was
brought in a Litter, having received, by a Stone
out of a Sling, a Wound from a young Shepherd,
in defence of a Shepherdess, and was in great dan∣ger.
At this News the King was very much con∣cern'd,
and order'd the Shepherd to be put into a
Dungeon; and the like Fate the Princess <HI>Carpillona</HI>
underwent, by a private Order of the Prince, who
resolved to make her consent to marry him, or to
put her to the severest Torments: But it seemed
that these two Lovers were only parted by a slight
Partition, the Boards of which being not joined
close, they had the Satisfaction of seeing each other
when the Sun shone in at Noon, and the Remainder
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
of their time had the more liberty to entertain
their Sorrows. They said all the tender and pas∣sionate
things Hearts so deeply touch'd could in∣vent,
and express'd themselves in such moving
Terms, that they often dissolved into Tears. The
Creatures of the Prince came every day to the
Princess, to threaten her with a speedy Death, if
she did not accept the Honour he did her. She re∣ceived
all their Proposals with a Firmness of Mind,
and an Air of Disdain, insomuch that they began to
despair of their Undertaking. “Fear nothing, my
dear Shepherd, <HI>said she,</HI> the Dread of the most
cruel Torments cannot make me unfaithful; we
will die together, if we cannot live so.” “Fair
Princess, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> do you think to comfort me?
Alas! would it not be more easy to me to see you
in the Arms of this Monster, than in the Hands
of an Executioner?” In short, these Sentiments of
his were not relish'd by her; she accused him of
Weakness, and assured him she would shew him an
Example, and die with Courage.</P>
<P>The Prince's Wound growing better, his Love,
enraged with the continual Denials of the Princess,
made him resolve to sacrifice her, with the young
Shepherd, to his Rage; and to that end appointed
a Day for this dismal Tragedy, and desired the
King, and all the Lords of the Kingdom, to be
present: and for himself, he came in an open Lit∣ter,
to glut his Eyes with this horrid Sight. The
King, not knowing the Princess <HI>Carpillona</HI> was a
Prisoner, when he saw her bound with her Go∣verness,
who was condemn'd to suffer the same
Fate as herself and Shepherd, who appeared as
bright as the Sun; he ordered them to be brought
to him upon the Terrass, where he was with his
Court, and not waiting for the Princess's making
her Complaint for the ill and base Usage she had
had, cut the Cords wherewith she was bound, and
afterwards looking upon the Shepherd, found his
Bowels earn with Tenderness and Compassion:
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
“Rash Youth, <HI>said he, speaking to him with all the
Harshness he was master of,</HI> what could inspire thee
with so much Boldness, as to attack so great a
Prince, and to reduce him almost to Death?” The
Shepherd shewing an awful Respect, and a Confi∣dence
unknown to him before, reply'd, and said
with a wonderful Intrepidity, “Great Monarch,
the Danger which I saw that fair Princess in,
was the occasion of this rash Action; I knew not
your Son, and much less in an Attempt so vio∣lent,
and so much below a Prince.” As he spoke,
he invigorated his Discourse, by raising his Voice
and his Gesture, wherein his Arm lay bare, and
the Arrow, wherewith he was marked, appeared
too visible, not to be perceived by the King; who
cry'd out, “O Heavens! am I deceived? or have I
found my Son again, whom I had lost?” “No,
Great King, <HI>said the Fairy</HI> Amazona, <HI>mounted in the
Air upon a stately Horse,</HI> you are not deceived; be∣hold
thy Son, whom I preserved in an Eagle's
Nest, where he was carried by the Order of his
barbarous Brother, for the Loss of whom he must
be thy Comfort.” And as she made an end of
these words, flew at the guilty Prince, and with
her Lance pierced his Heart, which reduced him
presently to Ashes.</P>
<P>After this the Fairy went to the Terrass, and
presented the Prince, no longer now a Shepherd,
with a Suit of Armour, saying to him, “These
I promised thee, and with these thou shalt be
invulnerable, and the greatest Warriour in the
World.” Hereupon there were heard in the Air
the Soundings of Trumpets, and all manner of war∣like
Instruments, which were follow'd with a soft
and melodious Symphony to Words in the praise of
the Prince and Princess. The Fairy alighted from
off her Horse, placed herself by the King, and de∣sired
him to give Orders for solemnizing the Mar∣riage;
and then commanded a Genius, that appear'd
at her Call, to go and fetch the illustrious and
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
royal Shepherd and his Family; which immediately
went, and return'd with them. What a Satisfaction
was this, after such long Troubles! The Palace
was fill'd with Cries of Joy, and none was ever
equal to that of these two Kings and their Chil∣dren.
The Nuptials were celebrated with great
Magnificence; after which the kind Fairy took her
leave, and disappear'd. The King <HI>Sublimus</HI> return'd
to his own Dominions, <HI>Carpillona</HI> lived with her
dear Spouse in all imaginable Pleasure, and the
old King, overjoy'd to see a Son so worthy of his
Love, grew young again with the Satisfaction he
enjoy'd, and lengthen'd out his days some time
longer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Story of the Princess <HI>Carpillona</HI> was too
well liked and approved of by all the Com∣pany,
for them to be impatient for their Dinner;
and just as it was made an end of, Madam <HI>de St.
Thomas</HI> appear'd at the end of the Walk, rusling in
her stiff Silks. And as she always loved to be
somewhat singular, and having seen on Skreens and
Fans, Blacks carrying Umbrelloes, she bethought
herself of providing one; and to that end made
choice of a Farmer's little Boy, who had very much
the Features, and rubbed his Face and Hands over
with Soot and Ink; but when the Soot came upon
his Lips, the Bitterness was so great, that he would
not suffer both to be black'd, but only the under
one. The Baroness then made another Exception
against the length of his Hair, but the Farmer's
Wife would not let it be cut off; but in short, af∣ter
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
several Threats, my Lady was forced to sub∣mit,
and this new-moulded Black carried her Um∣brello.</P>
<P>The Baron knew nothing of all this, but when
she made her Appearance, they all, except her Hus∣band,
burst out into Laughter; for the Black, with
his red Lip and long Hair, was no less singular in
his kind, than she was in hers. These <HI>Paris</HI> Dames,
who affected as much Freedom and Coquetry, as
she Preciseness and Formality, rose up immediate∣ly,
and running with open Arms, and embracing her
till they had like to have stifled her, said, “Good-morrow,
dear Madam, how glad are we to see
you! You have heard of the Accident that befel
our Coach, which underwent the same Fate as
<HI>Phaeton</HI>'s Chariot.” “You mean, Ladies, <HI>answer'd
Madam</HI> St. Thomas, <HI>with an Air of Contempt and In∣struction,
Apollo</HI>'s, who was so imprudent as to lend
him his; therefore you should not say <HI>Phaeton</HI>'s
Chariot, but that which <HI>Apollo</HI> lent him.” “O Ma∣dam,
<HI>said the Widow,</HI> you are Mistress of an Ex∣actness,
of which I am not so mindful.” “Yes,
<HI>reply'd the Baroness,</HI> we want no more that here in
the Country, than they who live in Town.” “And
why so much good Sense?” <HI>answer'd Madam</HI> de
“Lure.” “I pretend to as much, <HI>answer'd the Ba∣roness,</HI>
and know as well when I read it, and
speak it.”</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> knowing his Wife to be
very nice upon the point of Ceremony, never dis∣puted
but that she was chagrin'd, that a Citizen
richly dress'd, as Madam <HI>Rouet</HI> was, should use so
much freedom as to say my Dear at the first word;
and fearing a Rupture, presented his Hand to the
new-married Lady, and obliged the Viscount to do
the same by the Widow. The Prior, after their
example, offer'd to help the Baroness forward, who,
displeased with that Expression, and being out of
humour before, said, with Fire in her Eyes, “What,
am I so weak or old, as to stand in need of a
<PB N="226" REF="227"/>
Support, or is this a design'd Affront?” To which
he, knowing she wanted an Excuse to fall out with
somebody, made no Reply. However, she still
grumbled to herself, and seeing that these Ladies
looked upon her Black with great Surprize, and
had something to do to constrain their Laughter
again; she said. “Ladies, you seem amazed at
something that belongs to me; pray what is it?”
“Upon my word, <HI>said Madam</HI> de Rouet, I never in
my life saw such a Black as this at <HI>Paris.</HI>” “O
<HI>Paris, reply'd Madam</HI> St. Thomas, I warrant no∣thing
can be right but what comes from thence.”
“But, <HI>said Madam</HI> de Lure, you will allow this
Boy's Paint to be extraordinary.” “Indeed,
<HI>reply'd the Baroness, laughing in her turn,</HI> some daub
with White, and some with Black.” Madam <HI>de
Rouet,</HI> applying this piece of Pleasantry to herself,
return'd it again with Interest; which put the Ba∣ron,
who was a Man of good Manners, into some
pain, that this first Visit should be attended with
such piquant Reflections: he therefore endeavour'd
to repair all by his Praises, which being given <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
propos,</HI> created a more sensible Pleasure in these La∣dies,
than his Wife's ill Temper had given them
Chagrin; who made an Excuse, after Dinner, to go
into her Chamber for something she had forgot.
But as they talked on various Subjects, at last the
Discourse happening to fall on <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> the
Prior told very agreeably all his Quarrels with his
Neighbour and Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> and his great Inclina∣tions
to <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-Quixot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm;</HI> and we may be sure <HI>Alain</HI>'s
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leries were not forgot.</P>
<P>The Stories that were told of him, raised in
these Ladies a great Desire to see him: which the
Baron told them might easily be done, if they
would give themselves the trouble to go up into
his Chamber. “Well, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> I'll go and
tell him of the Visit you intend him, that he may
be prepared, and arm himself.” “What, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Widow,</HI> must he arm to receive us? Sure
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
he will not fight with Women.” “No, <HI>said he,</HI>
he is far from doing that, for he is as courteous
as any Knight-Errant.” Then he left them, to
tell <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> what charming Ladies there were,
and charged him, above all things, not to find
fault with their Dialect, since they came from <HI>Pa∣ris;</HI>
where four and twenty hours Residence was
sufficient to supply them with Wit all the rest of
their Lives, and that they could not have a more
competent Judge than himself, who having been
born there, must have sucked in with his Nurse's
Milk, Wit and Politeness, and the Loves and Gra∣ces.
“I don't know whether you may believe it,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, but nothing is more true;
for, in my opinion, I have such Thoughts, as no
other Person bath like me: I have Sentiments so
delicate, that they plainly make it appear, they
proceed from a delicate Soul; and Delicacy de∣fines
both the outward and inward Man.” “I
understand you, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> you desire, since
these Ladies are of <HI>Paris,</HI> passionately to see them;
and I'll go and acquaint them so.” “Hold, hold,
Sir, <HI>cry'd the Cit,</HI> I am in Bed, all undress'd, and
feel a noble Shame; you know I spend all my
time upon my Studies, and reflecting upon my
Misfortunes: but give me leave to turn my Shirt,
or lend me one of yours.” “I believe, <HI>said the
Prior, maliciously,</HI> you had better arm yourself,
which may impose on them; for every Man
arm'd in Bed, may bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of pleasing the Ladies;
for the Sex, though timorous themselves, esteem
Courage, and love Heroes.”</P>
<P>“Quick, quick, <HI>Alain,</HI> my Armour, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan∣dinardiere,
my Turban, and my Breast-Plate.”
“What, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Valet,</HI> have you a mind to
lame yourself? that nasty hard Bedstead of yours,
has almost flea'd you already; and when you have
those Bodice on, you will be”—“Wretch,
<HI>cry'd his Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> thou will never be fit to gaher
any thing but Thistles in the Field of <HI>Mars,</HI> since
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
thou call'st those military Arms, which are to a∣dorn
me like a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator, Bodice: how canst
thou speak in so low a Style?” “I beseech you,
Sir, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> not so much of your lofty Ex∣pressions;
the Ladies wait.” “Alas! Sir, <HI>an∣swer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere; what Ears have you, that
nothing can offend them? For my part, my
Valet's Absurdities stun me as much as an Ala∣rum
Bell; I cannot bear a wry Word: And, was
I to merit a Kingdom to hear Words ill-apply'd,
and all manner of Barbarisms, I should renounce
it.” “O! Sir, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> the Languages are
infinitely obliged to you; and I hope you will
meet with no Ingratitude: for in short, I un∣derstand,
(but I'd have you be secret) that the
Learned intend to write your Life.” “O! Sir,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>transported with the most sen∣sible
Pleasure Man could be capable of,</HI> I cannot doubt,
but what you say is truth, since I have always
received those Gentlemen handsomely at my Table.
It is certain, that <HI>Homer, Herod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us, Plutarch, Sene∣ca,
Voiture, Corneille,</HI> and even <HI>Harlequin</HI> himself,
have dined above thirty time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with me, and have
made me ready to die with laughter; besides, I
took their coming without Ceremony, as a par∣ticular
Favour; and always left orders with my
Steward, when I was either with the Army, or
at <HI>Versailles,</HI> to keep the same Table: But is it
possible that they should remember so slight a
mark of my Friendship? Well, I think I am well
rewarded: and indeed, I could not have thought
they would have remembred a Country Philoso∣pher,
like me.” “The Reason is, <HI>reply'd the Prior,
ready to burst <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is sides,</HI> because you are a Phi∣losopher;
I am glad to hear, you keep company of
such Merit, <HI>Cato</HI> is very pleasant and merry.” “I
don't very well know <HI>Cato, reply'd the learned Cit,</HI>
I think he came not so often as the rest.” “Ah!
but, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> he is one of your Friends; and
it is resolved by them, to write of whatever has
pass'd, that's memorable, in your Life: but there
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
is one thing they boggle at, and that is, you are
too covetous.” “As times go now, <HI>reply'd the other,
somewhat chagrin'd,</HI> it is no fault; for if I should
throw away all I have, I might hang myself af∣terwards.
Believe me, Sir, Heroes neither sow
nor spin; they know not that happy Arithmetick
of making four of two, therefore they ought to
keep what they have.” “Prudence, <HI>said the Prior,</HI>
must be commended by all the World, and your
Historians will be sure not to forget yours; but
when they come to speak of your Marriage, how
would you have them to mention it? Shall they
say, you was desperately in love with a Lady of
great Quality and Worth; but that, because she
had not a great Fortune, you would not have her?
That will sound but very base.” “Ha! ha! <HI>said</HI>
Dandinardiere; Who desired them to write my
History? Had I been fond of Praises, do you
think I should have left <HI>Paris,</HI> where they so
much abound, to bury myself here in the Coun∣try,
where they value themselves, upon saying
the hardest and most shocking things to one's face?
and though sometimes I don't answer that Cha∣racter,
yet I can return Answers with as much
Violence as other People; but I avoid Quarrels.”
“I understand you, Mr. <HI>Dandinardiere, said the Prior;</HI>
this Freedom of mine is no way pleasing to you:
but it is owing to my Respect for you, I would
wish you a compleat Gentleman; which you ne∣ver
can be, with that Foundation of Covetousness,
which”—Here <HI>Dandinardi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> vex'd to the
Soul, interrupted him, and told him, that he had
forgot the Ladies, who sent him, and desired him
to conduct them to him, that their Discourse might
be more pleasant and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iverting.</P>
<P>The Prior ran immediately to them, who waited
with impatience; and told them, with a serious face,
great part of their Conversation, but durst not
make too great a Jest of the Cit before Madam <HI>de
St. Thomas,</HI> who would have taken his part, back and
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
edge. The Visiters went presently to <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s
Chamber, who made so ridiculous a figure, that
the gravest Person would have found it an hard
task, to have preserved a serious Countenance:
His Nose and Cheeks were cruelly scratch'd, and
withal, so red and bloated, that he look'd like a
Trumpeter after a long Blast: besides, his Turban
was no less to be admired than his Armour. As
Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI> was the first that enter'd the
Room▪ she made him a very low Courtesy; but
when she cast her Eyes upon him, she was sur∣prized
to f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd him to be her Cousin <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>flet,</HI> a
Tradesman in <HI>St. Dennis-street.</HI> They both seem'd
to e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>press a great Joy, and embracing each other,
whisper'd silence: for the Cousin <HI>Rouet</HI> was as much
afraid of being known, as Cousin <HI>Cristoflet.</HI> But as
she had been inform'd of his Maggots a long time,
and had heard that, in spite of all his Friends could
say to him, he was resolv'd, after Fortune had cast
an auspicious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook on him, to set up for a fine Gen∣tleman,
and being herself no less guilty of the same
Folly, she was the more inclined to excuse him.
They both talk'd of nothing but their Ancestors,
how one's Great-Uncle was a Duke, the other's a
Marquiss, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was as much matter of fact,
as <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s entertaining the seven Sages of
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>All the Company was very much surprized, to
see <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> and the Widow so great: The
Baron was vex'd at what he told her, fearing it
might be some Obstacle to the Marriage; for tho
he seem'd to be very indifferent, yet in the main
he was very desirous it might be: He express'd a
great Joy to see them at a time when he so little
expected them. “Indeed, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, when
I left the Court, I took care to conceal my Re∣treat
from my dearest Friends, who I knew would
be concern'd for my Absence; and I must needs
say, I was grieved myself.” “You cannot ima∣gine,
<HI>said the Widow,</HI> how much it was regretted;
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
I know some of the finest Ladies of the Court,
who wore the rest of the Year no Ribbands, La∣ces,
or coloured Clothes.” “Alas! <HI>said</HI> Dandinar∣diere,
<HI>fetching a deep Sigh;</HI> poor Ladies! it grieves
my Heart.” “There appear'd as much mourning
in their Faces, <HI>continu'd she,</HI> as if it had been for
an Husband.” “Ha! ha! ha! <HI>cry'd the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> what
is this you tell me? Well, I am in pain for that
fair young Dutchess; I should be inconsolable, if
I have disturbed her Repose: For hitherto, <HI>con∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> you must own, Madam, we have mana∣ged
matters so well, that the World has not

Hearts.” Madam <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> St. Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> listen'd some time
to their Conver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, but at last grew impatient,
and approaching the Viscount, said softly to him;
“What a Son-in-law is th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s you would persuade us
to? Don't you find that he has five hundred In∣trigues
on his hands; it will be an hard matter
to fix him?” “Don't be disgusted, Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
he,</HI> an Air of Gallantry is agreeable to Cour∣tiers;
don't think that they love, more than o∣ther
People; their Affections are the hardest to
settle: they know all the fine Turns of Gallan∣try;
sigh and persuade, and yet do not love
one whit the better.” “So much the worse, <HI>said
the Baroness,</HI> he will deceive us.” “No, Madam,
<HI>continued the Viscount,</HI> he is bred in a Court of more
Sincerity.” “What, <HI>Paris? said she.</HI>” Here the
Viscount was puzzled, what Court he should call
<HI>St. Dennis-street;</HI> when he was freed from the Per∣plexity
he was in, by the Arrival of the two young La∣dies,
who had been ask'd after, by these Visiters,
but could not get themselves dress'd ready by
dinner-time. They were, without dispute, beauti∣ful;
and, if they had not affected fantastical and ro∣mantick
Airs, were very amiable. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> see∣ing
them, made a sign to his Cousin <HI>Rouet,</HI> that
<HI>Virginia</HI> had made a cruel Rent in his Heart; which
engaged her to look more favourable on her, than
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
<HI>Marthonida;</HI> who would not have been very well
pleas'd, if Madam <HI>Lure</HI> had not pass'd a thousand
Compliments upon her. “I ought not to complain,
Madam, <HI>said she to her,</HI> of leaving the Court as I
have done, to come into the Country; where I
have the happiness of meeting with a Person so
charming as yourself.” “Madam, <HI>replied she,</HI> we
strive, as much as possible, to imitate you; but
our Endeavours are all in vain.” “Ah! what is
it you tell me, my Fair, <HI>cry'd Madam</HI> de Lure,
you are altogether amiable; I see Rays of Wit
dart from your Eyes, which ravish me.” The
Widow said a great many fine things to <HI>Virginia;</HI>
and in short, they both talked so together, that
they confounded each other. Never were Praises
deliver'd with a better Air; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> triumph'd,
and gave his Sentiments open-mouth'd: he was
overjoy'd, that the Widow applauded his growing
Passion; and <HI>Virginia,</HI> for her part, used all her
Eloquence.</P>
<P>The rest of the Company listen'd with great
Attention; but the Baroness was not over-well
pleased that her Daughters should engross all the
Praises; for she was one that thought all was her
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and look'd upon all the Compliments paid to
others, as injurious to herself: which put her into
so strange a Mood, that she would say nothing but
Yes and No. In the mean time the Conversation,
which could not always be on the Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antages of
Beauty, turn'd upon those of Wit; which raised
new Desires in Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI> and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI>
to offer up their Ince<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se; who looking at each
other, admired that inexhaustible Source of great
Words which signified <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle or nothing: when, to
make some diversion from the Subject they were
got into, the Viscount told Madam <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI>
that they two were great L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers by not being in
the Wood when the Ladies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead one of the finest
Stories of the Fairies that ever was made. “What,
<HI>said the Widow,</HI> are these Ladies acquainted with
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
these sorts of Amusements; have they got into
the Country already?” “and what do you take
us for, Madam? <HI>answr'd</HI> Virginia; do you think
that our Climate wants so much the favourable
Influences of some benevolent Star; and that we
are so very ignorant of what passes under your
celestial vaulted Roof? Indeed our Sphere is not
so much limited as you imagine; we know how to
lay our Scenes so well, as that the Author need
not to be ashamed.” “I must confess, <HI>said the new-married
Lady,</HI> that I did not expect to find the
Muses and Fairies so familiarly used here in the
Country; I should be overjoy'd to hear how they
are handled.” Upon this, <HI>Marthonida,</HI> who wan∣ted
not Merit and a good Opinion of herself, offer'd
to read a Story which she had just made an end of.
“Nothing can be more new, <HI>said</HI> Virginia, for it
has not yet been corrected.” All the Company
accepted of the Proposition; and as she had it
about her, she pull'd it out, and began thus:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Perfect Love: A Story.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of those agreeable Countries that depend
on the Empire of the Fairies, there reign'd the
formidable <HI>Danamo,</HI> who was as knowing in her
Art, as cruel in her Actions, and boasted of the
Honour of being descended from the celebrated
<HI>Calipso,</HI> whose Charms had the Glory and Power of
staying the famous <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and triumphing over the
Prudence of the Conquerors of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>She was lusty, had a wild Look, and her Pride
made her with some difficulty submit to the hard
Laws of Matrimony; for Love was not able to
reach her Heart: but the design of uniting a flou∣rishing
Kingdom to that she was Queen of, and
<PB N="234" REF="235"/>
another she had usurp'd, made her consent to mar∣ry
an old neighbouring King, who died some few
Years after their Marriage, and left the Fairy a
Daughter call'd <HI>Azira,</HI> who was very ugly; but
appear'd not so in the eyes of <HI>Danamo,</HI> who thought
her charming; perhaps, because like herself. She
was to be the Queen of three Kingdoms; which
Circumstance qualified all her Defects, and caused
her to be asked in Marriage by the most powerful
Princes of the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>This, together with the blind Friendship of <HI>Da∣namo,</HI>
render'd her Vanity insupportable, since she
was desired with an Ardour which she did in no
wise deserve. But as <HI>Danamo</HI> though of nothing
but rendring the Princess's Happiness compleat, she
brought up in her Palace a young Prince, her Bro∣ther's
Son; who was called <HI>Parcinus:</HI> he had a no∣ble
Air, a delicate Shape, a fine Head of Hair, so
admirably white, that Love himself might have
been jealous of his Power; for that God never had
golden Shafts more sure of triumphing over Hearts
without resistance, than the Eyes of <HI>Parcinus.</HI> He
did every thing well, danced and sung extraordi∣nary
fine, and gain'd all the Prizes at Tournaments,
whenever he contended for them.</P>
<P>This young Prince was the Delight of the Court;
and <HI>Danamo,</HI> who had her Designs, was not against
the Respect and Value they shew'd him. The King
his Father, was the Fairy's Brother, whom she de∣clared
War against without any Pretence whatso∣ever.
This King fought courageously at the head
of his Troops; but what could an Army do against
so powerful a Fairy as <HI>Danamo?</HI> who suffering the
Victory not to ballance long after her Brother's
Death, who was kill'd in the Action, with one
Stroke of her Wand dispersed her Enemies, and
became Mistress of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Parcinus</HI> was then an Infant in Arms; they brought
him to <HI>Danamo,</HI> for it would have been in vain to
have conceal'd him from a Fairy: he had then such
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
engaging Smiles, that they won all Hearts; and
<HI>Danamo</HI> caressing him, in few days after carried him
home with her to her own Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Prince was about eighteen Years old, when
the Fairy, willing to execute what she had so long
design'd, resolved to marry him with her Daughter;
and not doubting but the Prince, who was born
one, but by his Misfortunes made a Subject, would
be overjoy'd to become one day a Sovereign of
three Empires, sent for the Princess, and disco∣ver'd
to her the Choice she had made.</P>
<P>The Princess hearken'd to this Discourse with an
Emotion that made the Fairy think that this Reso∣lution
in favour of <HI>Parcinus,</HI> displeased her Daugh∣ter.
“I see, <HI>said she to her, observing her Disorder in∣crease,</HI>
that your Ambition carries you so far, that
you would add to your Empire the Dominions of
one of those Kings, who have demanded you so
often. But what Kings may not <HI>Parcinus</HI> over∣come?
His Courage is beyond every thing; the
Subjects of a Prince so accomplish'd, may some
time revolt in his favour; and by giving you to
him, I make sure of the Possession of his King∣dom.
And for his Person, we need not speak of
that; you know the proudest Beauties are not
able to resist his Charms.”</P>
<P>The Princess, casting herself suddenly at the feet
of the Fairy, interrupted her Discourse, and con∣fess'd
to her, That her Heart had not had the
power to withstand that young Victor, so famous
for his Conquest: “But, <HI>added sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, blushing,</HI> I have
given the insensible <HI>Parcinus</HI> a thousand Marks of
my Tenderness, which he receiv'd with a Cold∣ness
that makes me despair.” “Twas because he
durst not raise his Thoughts up to you, <HI>reply'd the
proud Fairy,</HI> he was without doubt afraid of dis∣pleasing
me; I know his Respect.”</P>
<P>This flattering Opinion was too agreeable to the
Princess's Inclination and Vanity, for her not to be
persuaded to it. In short, the Fairy sent for <HI>Par∣cinus,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
who came to her in a magnificent Closet,
where she, and the Princess her Daughter, waited
for him; where she said to him, as soon as she
saw him, “Call all your Courage to your aid; I
sent for you not to continue your Misfortune, but
for your good; reign, <HI>Parcinus:</HI> and to compleat
your Happiness, reign by marrying my Daughter.”
“I, Madam! <HI>cry'd the young Prince in an Amazement,
wherein it was easy to perceive his Joy had not the grea∣test
share;</HI> I marry the Princess, <HI>continued he, falling
back some Steps,</HI> alas! what God concerns himself
in my Fate, not to leave it to him alone from
whom I ask assistance?”</P>
<P>These Words were pronounced by the Prince
with an Heat which his Heart had too great a share
in, to be withstood by his Reason. The Fairy
thought that this unlook'd-for Happiness had put
him beside himself; but the Princess loved, and
Love makes Lovers more penetrating than Wisdom
itself. “What God, <HI>Parcinus, said she to him with
Disorder,</HI> do you so tenderly implore the assistance
of; I know too well I have no share in the Vows
you offer up to him.” The young Prince, who
had had time to recover his first Surprize, and
who knew he had been guilty of an Imprudence
in what he had done, summon'd all his Wit to the
aid of his Heart, and answer'd the Princess more
gallantly than she hoped for; and thank'd the Fairy
with an Air of Grandeur, that shew'd him not only
worthy of the Empire offer'd him, but that of the
whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Danamo,</HI> and her proud Daughter, who were both
satisfied with this Discourse, settled all things be∣fore
they went out of the Closet: The Fairy defer∣red
the Day of the Nuptials, only to give the Court
time to prepare themselves on so great an occasion.
After this, the News of <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Marriage with
<HI>Azira,</HI> was spread all about the Court; and the
Courtiers came in Crouds to congratulate the
Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238"/>
<HI>Parcinus</HI> receiv'd all their Compliments with an
Air of Coldness, which very much surprized his
new Subjects, that he should appear chagrin'd and
out of humour: All the rest of the day he was
perplex'd with the Congratulations of the whole
Court, and the continual Declarations of <HI>Azira</HI>'s
Passion.</P>
<P>What a Condition was the young Prince in, who
was seiz'd with a lively Grief? The Day seem'd to
him a thousand times longer than ordinary. The
impatient <HI>Parcinus</HI> long'd for night, which at last
came; when with haste he left that place where he
had suffer'd so much, and went to his own Apart∣ment;
and after having sent all his Attendants
away, open'd a Door that led into the Gardens of
the Palace, which he cross'd, follow'd only by a
young Slave.</P>
<P>A fine, but small River ran at the end of these
Gardens, and separated the Fairy's Palace from a
Castle flanked with four Towers, and surrounded
with a deep Ditch that was fill'd by the River:
thither flew <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Wishes and Desires.</P>
<P>A Wonder was shut up in it; which Treasure
<HI>Danamo</HI> had carefully guarded. It was a young
Princess, her Sister's Daughter, who when she died
left her to the Care of the Fairy; her Beauty,
worthy of the admiration of the whole World, ap∣pearing
too dangerous for <HI>Danamo</HI> to permit her
to be seen nigh <HI>Azira.</HI> Sometimes the charming
<HI>Irolita,</HI> which was her Name, was suffer'd to come
to the Palace to see the Fairy, and the Princess her
Daughter; but was never allow'd to appear in pub∣lick:
yet her Charms, tho concealed, were not
unknown to the World.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Parcinus</HI> had seen her with the Prin∣cess
<HI>Azira,</HI> and adored her from that very moment.
Their Nearness of Blood gave this young Prince no
privilege with <HI>Irolita;</HI> for after she was grown up,
the merciless <HI>Danamo</HI> permitted none to see her.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239"/>
In the mean time, <HI>Parcinus</HI> burnt with a raging
flame, which the Charms of <HI>Irolita</HI> had kindled;
she was about fourteen Years old; her Beauty was
perfect, her Hair of a fine brown, her Complection
blooming as the Spring; her Mouth delicate, her
Teeth admirably white and even; and her Smiles
engaging, her Eyes were of a fine hazle Colour,
and piercing, and her Looks seem'd to speak a
thousand things her young Heart as yet knew no∣thing
of.</P>
<P>She had been brought up in great Solitude, nigh
the Fairy's Palace, in the Castle where she lived;
but saw no more of the World than if she had been
in a Desart. <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Orders were so exactly obey∣ed,
that the fair <HI>Irolita</HI> pass'd her days only among
those Women appointed her, whose number was
very small, but yet as many as were necessary in so
lonely and retir'd a Court: however, Fame, which
regarded not <HI>Danamo,</HI> publish'd so many Wonders
of this young Princess, that Persons at the greatest
distance from the Court, offer'd themselves to be
with the young <HI>Irolita.</HI> And her Presence bely'd
not what Fame had reported, since they always
found her worthy of their Admiration.</P>
<P>A governant of great Wit and Knowledge, for∣merly
attach'd to the Princess her Mother, lived
with her, and often groan'd under the Rigours of
<HI>Danamo</HI> towards the charming <HI>Irolita:</HI> she was cal∣led
<HI>Mana;</HI> and her desire of setting the Princess at
liberty, and restoring her to her Right and Dignity,
made her yield to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Love. It was then
three Years since he was first introduced into the
Castle in the Habit of a Slave; at which time he
found her in the Garden, and discover'd to her his
Passion; and as she was then but a Child, she lo∣ved
<HI>Parcinus</HI> only as a Brother. <HI>Mana,</HI> who was
never absent long from her, surprized the young
Prince in the Garden one day, when he acquainted
her with his Love for the Princess, and the Design
he had form'd to lose his Life, or restore her Liber∣ty;
<PB N="339" REF="240"/>
and seeking, by shewing himself to his Subjects,
a glorious Revenge on <HI>Danamo,</HI> and placing <HI>Irolita</HI>
on the Throne. As the rising Merit of <HI>Parcinus</HI>
was capable of rendring the most difficult Projects
credible, and was the only means to deliver <HI>Irolita,
Mana</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer'd him to come sometimes to the Castle
when it was night; but never let him see the Prin∣cess,
except in her presence. He, with his tender
Discourse, and his constant Sedulities, endeavour'd to
inspire in her as violent a Passion as his own. Thus
employ'd for three Years, he went almost every night
to the Castle, and spent all the days in nothing but
thinking of his Princess. But to return to where
we left him crossing the Gardens, follow'd by a
Slave, and pierced with Grief at the Resolutions of
the Fairy: When he came to the River-side, a guil∣ded
Boat which <HI>Azira</HI> sometimes took the Air in, that
was fasten'd to the Bank, served to carry this amo∣rous
Prince over. The Slave row'd, and as soon
as <HI>Parcinus</HI> had got up a silken Ladder, that was
thrown out from off a little Terrass, that fronted
the Castle, the faithful Slave row'd the Boat back
again, where he waited for a Signal he made him,
which was to shew him a lighted Flambeau from
off the Terrass. That night the Prince took his
usual Tour; the silken Ladder was let down, and
he enter'd without any Obstacle the young <HI>Irolita</HI>'s
Chamber, whom he found laid on the Bed all in
Tears: but the Beauty that appear'd in that melan∣choly
Posture, had an extraordinary effect on the
Prince!</P>
<P>“What ails my Princess? <HI>said he, falling on his
Knees by the Bed-side wher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on she l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;</HI> what could
cause these precious Tears: Alas! <HI>continued he,
sighing,</HI> have I yet new Misfortunes to hear?” The
Tears and Sighs of these young Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers were inter∣mix'd,
and they were forced to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent their Passion,
before they could tell the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause of their Grief.
At length the young Prince desired <HI>Irolita</HI> to tell
him what new Severity the Fairy had used to her.
<PB N="240" REF="241"/>
“She will make you marry <HI>Azira, answer'd the beau∣tiful</HI>
Irolita, <HI>blushing,</HI> which, of all her Cruelties,
is the most painful to me.” “Oh! my dear Prin∣cess,
<HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> you fear lest I should marry
<HI>Azira;</HI> my Fate is a thousand times more kind
than I thought it.” “Can you praise Fate, <HI>re∣ply'd
the young</HI> Irolita <HI>languishingly,</HI> when it is rea∣dy
to separate us? I cannot express the Tor∣ments,
the Dread of that makes me feel. Oh!
<HI>Parcinus,</HI> you are in the right, the Love of a
Lover, and that of a Brother, is quite different.”
The amorous Prince thought to thank his Fortune,
he never till then knew the Love the young <HI>Irolita</HI>
had for him; and, in short, could no longer doubt
of the good Fortune of having inspired such tender
Sentiments into the Princess. This Happiness,
which he did not expect, rouzed up all his Hopes.
“No, <HI>cry'd he in a Transport,</HI> I despair not now of
overcoming our Misfortunes, since I am assured
of your Tenderness. Let us fly, my Princess, let
us avoid the Rage of <HI>Danamo,</HI> and her hateful
Daughter; let us not trust to so fatal an Abode,
Love alone will make us happy.” “Should I go
away with you, <HI>reply'd the Princess with Surprize,</HI>
what would the World say of my Flight?” “Lay
aside these vain Reflections, fair <HI>Irolita, interrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
the impatient</HI> Parcinus, every Circumstance urges
us to leave this Place, let us go—”▪ “But
where will you go? <HI>reply'd the prudent</HI> Mana, (who
was always with them, and who, less engaged than
those young Lovers, foresaw all the Difficulties in
their Flight.) “I will give you an account of my
Designs, <HI>reply'd the Prince;</HI> but how did you hear
so soon the News from the Fairy's Court?” “A
Relation of mine, <HI>answer'd</HI> Mana, writ to me as
soon as it was whisper'd about the Palace, and I
thought it my Duty to inform the Princess of it.”
“And what have I endured since? <HI>reply'd the lovely</HI>
Irolita: No, <HI>Parcinus,</HI> I cannot live without you.”
The young Prince, transported with Love, and
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
charmed with these words, kissed <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Hand
with an Ardour and Tenderness, that had all the
Thanks of a first and most agreeable Favour. Day
began to appear, and inform'd <HI>Parcinus</HI> too soon,
that it was time he retired, when he assured the
Princess he would come again the next Night, and
impart to her his Project; he got to the Boat and
Slave again, and retired to his Apartment. He was
so overjoy'd with the Pleasure of being beloved by
the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> and agitated by the Difficulties he
foresaw they should meet with in their Flight,
that Sleep could not calm that Uneasiness, nor make
him forget a moment of his Happiness.</P>
<P>It was hardly Morning, when a Dwarf enter'd
his Chamber, and presented him with a fine Scarf
from the Princess <HI>Azira,</HI> who by a Billet more ten∣der
than he wish'd for, desired him to wear from
that day that Scarf. He sent an Answer, which
very much confounded him, but he was obliged to
it, to deliver <HI>Irolita,</HI> and to constrain himself for
her Liberty. When he had sent <HI>Azira</HI>'s Dwarf a∣way,
a Giant came from <HI>Danamo,</HI> and presented
him with a Sabre of an extraordinary Beauty, the
Handle of which was of one single Stone, more
beautiful than a Diamond, and which gave a great
Light in the night; on this Sabre were engraved
these words:
<Q>For the Hand of a Conqueror.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Parcinus</HI> was mightily pleased with the Fairy's
Present, and went and thanked her with that and
the Scarf on. The Tenderness of <HI>Irolita</HI> suspended
all Disquiets, she had raised in his Heart that sweet
and perfect Satisfaction successful Love feels; a
pleasant Air appeared in all his Actions, which <HI>A∣zira</HI>
attributed to her Charms, and the Fairy to
<HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Ambition: the day was spent in Pleasures
and Diversion, which in no wise diminish'd the
insupportable length <HI>Parcinus</HI> thought it.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243"/>
In the Evening they took the Air in the Gardens
of the Palace, and on the same River so well known
to the Prince, who, in going in the Boat, felt a
sensible Concern, to see what difference there was
between the Pleasures it used to give him, and the
cruel Torment he then endured. <HI>Parcinus</HI> could
not forbear looking often at the Habitation of the
charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> who never appeared when the Fai∣ry
or <HI>Azira</HI> were on the Water. That Princess,
who watch'd all the Actions of the Prince, observ'd
that his Eyes were often turn'd towards the Castle.
“What do you look at, Prince? <HI>said she:</HI> in the
midst of the Honours done you, is <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Prison
worthy your Regard?” “Yes, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Prince, very imprudently,</HI> I am sensible of the Suf∣ferings
of those who deserve them not.” “You
are too compassionate, <HI>answer'd</HI> Azira <HI>disdainfully;</HI>
but to ease you of your Pain, I can tell you, <HI>Ire∣lita</HI>
will not be long a Prisoner.” “And what will
become of her?” <HI>reply'd the young Prince short.</HI> “The
Queen will marry her in five days to the Prince
<HI>Brutus, return'd</HI> Azira; he is of our Blood, you
know, and according to the Intentions of the
Queen, he will, the next day after their Mar∣riage,
carry <HI>Irolita</HI> into a Fortress, from whence
she will never return to Court.” “What, <HI>said the
Prince, in an extraordinary Disorder,</HI> will the Queen
give that beautiful Princess to so hideous a Prince,
whose ill Qualities exceed his Deformity? What
Cruelty is this!” This last word came from him
against his will, but he could no longer conceal his
Resentment. “I thought that you, of all People,
<HI>Parcinus, answer'd the Princess haughtily,</HI> should not
complain of <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Cruelties.” This Conversa∣tion,
without doubt, had been pushed too far for the
young Prince, whose business it was to dissemble,
if by good luck the Attendants of <HI>Azira</HI> had not
come up to them, and the Fairy appeared on the
River-side. <HI>Azira</HI> returned to the Fairy, and <HI>Par∣cinus</HI>
coming out of the Boat, feigned to be sick,
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
that he might have the more liberty to go and
complain, without any Witness, of his new Mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>The Fairy, and above all <HI>Azira,</HI> shew'd a great
Uneasiness for his being ill. He retired, accusing
Fate a thousand times for the Misfortunes that
threaten'd the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> abandoning himself
to all his Grief and Tenderness; but beginning at
length to recover those Disorders faithful Lovers
are so subject to, he writ, in the most moving Ex∣pressions
his Love could dictate, to one of his Aunts,
whose Name was <HI>Favourable;</HI> who was a Fairy as
well as <HI>Danamo,</HI> but one who took as much plea∣sure
in comforting and assisting the Unfortunate, as
<HI>Danamo</HI> did in making them so. He told her to
what a cruel Condition his Love and Fortune had
reduced him; and not daring to leave <HI>Danamo</HI>'s
Court without discovering his Designs, he sent his
faithful Slave with it.</P>
<P>When every body was retired, he left his Apart∣ment
as usual, and crossing the Gardens alone, went
into the Boat, without knowing whether he could
row or not; but what will not Love learn us? he
row'd as well as the most expert Seaman, and got
into the Castle, where he was very much surpriz'd
to find <HI>Mana</HI> only, and she all in Tears, in the
Princess's Chamber. “What is the matter with
you, <HI>Mana, said the Prince in haste,</HI> and where is
my dear <HI>Irolita?</HI>” “Alas! Sir, <HI>said</HI> Mana, she is
not here, a Troop of the Queen's Guards, and
some Women, carried her away from this Castle
three or four Hours ago.” <HI>Parcinus</HI> heard not the
end of these words, but swooned away as soon as
he understood the Princess was gone. <HI>Mana</HI> took
a great deal of pains to bring him to himself again,
which was no sooner done, but falling suddenly
into a Passion, he drew a little Dagger he wore in
his Girdle, and had pierced his Heart, had not the
wise <HI>Mana,</HI> holding his Arm, and falling on her
Knees, said, “What, Sir, will you forsake <HI>Irolita?</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="245"/>
Live to deliver her from <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Rage. Alas!
without you, where will she find Succours against
the Cruelty of the Fairy?” These words suspend∣ed
the unhappy Prince's Despair: “Alas! <HI>reply'd
he, shedding Tears, which all his Courage could not re∣strain;</HI>
where is my Princess? Yes, <HI>Mana,</HI> I will
live to have the sad Satisfaction of dying for her,
and expiring, in revenging her of her Enemies.”
After these words, <HI>Mana</HI> begged of him to leave
that dismal Place, to avoid fresh Misfortunes. “Go,
Prince, <HI>said she,</HI> how know we but the Fairy has
somebody here to give her an account of what
passes? Take care of a Life, so dear to a Prin∣cess
you adore.” After this Promise the Prince
went away, and return'd to his own Apartment
with all the Grief so unhappy and tender a Passion
could inspire. He pass'd the Night on a Couch he
threw himself on when he went in, where Day
surprized him; which had appeared some Hours,
when he heard a noise at his Chamber-Door. He
ran with that eager impatience we generally ex∣press,
when we expect News, wherein our Hearts
are so much concern'd; and found, that his People
had brought a Man who wanted to speak with him
in haste, and whom he knew to be one of <HI>Mana</HI>'s
Relations: he gave <HI>Parcinus</HI> a Letter, who went
into his Closet to hide the Trouble it might give
him; where he open'd it, and found these words:</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MANA;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the greatest Prince in the World.</HEAD>
<P>“BE assured, Sir, our Princess is in safety, if that
Expression may be allow'd, while in the power
of her Enemy; she has ask'd <HI>Danamo</HI> for me, who
has suffer'd me to be with her: there is a Guard
in the Palace. Yesternight the Queen sent for
her into her Closet, and order'd her proudly, to
look on the Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> as one that was to be
her Husband in a few days, and presented to her
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
that Prince, so unworthy of being your Rival.
The Princess was so much afflicted, that she made
her no Answer, but by Tears, which are not yet
dry'd up. You, Sir, must find out means, if pos∣sible,
to assist her against such pressing Misfor∣tunes.”</P>
<P>At the bottom of the Letter these words were
writ-blotted, and with a trembling Hand.</P>
<P>“HOW much I pity you, my dear Prince; your
Calamities are more grievous to me than my
own: I spare your Tenderness the Recital of
what I have endured since yesterday; why should
I trouble the Repose of your Life? Alas! per∣haps
without me you might be happy.”</P>
<P>What Joy and Grief did the Prince feel? What
Kisses he gave this invaluable Token of the Divine
<HI>Irolita</HI>'s Love? He was so much beside himself, that
he had much ado to return a suitable Answer; he
thank'd the prudent <HI>Mana,</HI> inform'd the Princess of
the Assistance he expected from the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI>
and said a thousand things on his Grief and Love:
afterwards he gave the Letter to <HI>Mana</HI>'s Relation,
and with it a Present of fine Jewels of an inesti∣mable
Value, to recompense him for the pleasure
he had done him. He was scarcely gone, when
the Queen and Princess <HI>Azira</HI> sent to know how
the Prince did; it was easy to know, by his Looks,
that he was not well; they press'd him to go to
bed, which he agreed to, thinking he should be
less constrain'd than if he went to the Fairy.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Queen went herself to see him,
and spoke to him of <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Marriage with the
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> as a thing resolved on. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> who
had at last resolved to restrain himself, to carry on
his Designs the better, seem'd to approve of the
Fairy's Intentions, and desired her only to stay till
he was recover'd, because he had a great mind to
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
be at that Solemnity. The Fairy and <HI>Azira,</HI> who
despair'd at his Sickness, promised him what he ask∣ed;
by which means he retarded the dismal Nuptials
of <HI>Irolita</HI> for some days. The Conversation he had
on the Water with <HI>Azira</HI> forwarded the Misfortune
of the Princess he loved so tenderly, for <HI>Azira</HI> had
given the Queen an account of his Discourse and his
Compassion for <HI>Irolita.</HI> And the Queen, who never
delay'd the Execution of her Will, sent that Even∣ing
for <HI>Irolita,</HI> and resolved, with <HI>Azira,</HI> to finish
the Marriage of that Princess, and to hasten her
Departure before <HI>Parcinus</HI> had a more established
Authority; but in the mean time, before the Expi∣ration
of the time, the faithful Slave arrived. How
great was <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Joy, to find in the Letter <HI>Fa∣vourable</HI>
had writ, Marks of her Compassion and
Friendship for him and <HI>Irolita!</HI> She sent him a lit∣tle
Ring, composed of four different Metals, Gold,
Silver, Brass, and Iron; this Ring had the power
of securing them four times against the Persecutions
of the cruel <HI>Danamo:</HI> and <HI>Favourable</HI> assured the
Prince, that the wicked Fairy could not pursue
them oftner than the Ring had power to save them.
This good News restored the young Prince to his
Health, he sent in all haste for <HI>Mana</HI>'s Relation,
and gave him a Letter, that inform'd <HI>Irolita</HI> of the
happy Success they might flatter themselves withal.
They had no time to lose, the Queen was for con∣summating
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI>'s Marriage in three days,
and that same Night <HI>Azira</HI> made a Ball, and <HI>Irolita</HI>
was to be there. <HI>Parcinus</HI> could not think of being
negligent on that occasion; he dress'd himself in a
magnificent Suit, and appear'd a thousand times
brighter than the Day, but durst not speak to <HI>Iro∣lita,</HI>
except with his Eyes, which often met those
of that fair Princess. <HI>Irolita</HI> had on the noblest
Dress imaginable; the Fairy had given her very
fine Jewels, and as she had but four Days to stay
in her Palace, resolved to treat her as she ought to
be. Her Beauty, not used to be set off with such
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
Ornaments, seem'd wonderful to all, and much
more to the amorous <HI>Parcinus,</HI> who thought, by the
Joy that he saw in her bright Eyes, she had re∣ceived
his Letter. The Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> talked often
with <HI>Irolita,</HI> but he appear'd of so ill a Mien under
the Gold and Jewels he was loaded with, that he
was not a Rival worthy of the young Prince's Jea∣lousy.
The Ball was almost over, when <HI>Parcinus,</HI>
transported with his Love, desired, with great ar∣dour,
the liberty of talking a moment with the
Princess. “Cruel Queen, and thou hateful <HI>Azira,
said he to himself,</HI> will you deprive me yet longer
of the charming Pleasure of telling the fair <HI>Iro∣lita</HI>
a thousand times how I adore her? Why
leave you not, you jealous Witnesses of my Hap∣piness,
the Place, since Love can only triumph in
your Absence?” He had hardly form'd this Wish,
but the Fairy, finding herself a little out of order,
call'd <HI>Azira,</HI> and went with her into the next Room,
whither Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> follow'd them; <HI>Parcinus</HI> had
then the Ring on his Finger the Fairy <HI>Favourable</HI>
had sent him. He ought to have preserved the
Succours given him for more pressing Occasions,
but violent Love and Prudence are seldom Compa∣nions;
the young Prince thought, by the Fairy's
and <HI>Azira</HI>'s Departure, that the Ring began to fa∣vour
his Love: he flew to the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> and
spoke to her of his Passion in the most touching and
eloquent Expressions; when he perceived that he
had made use of <HI>Favourable</HI>'s Charm sillily, but could
not repent of an Imprudence which gain'd him the
pleasure of entertaining his dear <HI>Irolita:</HI> they re∣solved
on the Place and Hour to put an end to their
cruel Slavery the next day. The Fairy and <HI>Azira</HI>
return'd again some time after, <HI>Parcinus</HI> parted with
no small Regret from <HI>Irolita,</HI> and looking on his
Ring, perceived the Iron was mix'd with the other
Metals, and saw very well that he had but three
Wishes to make, which he resolved to employ bet∣ter
than the first for his Princess; but trusted none
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
with his Departure, but his faithful Slave. The
next day he appear'd to the Queen very easy, and
more pleasant than ordinary; he pass'd some Compli∣ments
on the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> upon his Marriage, and
did it in a manner capable of removing all Suspi∣cious
they might entertain of his Passion. At two
a-clock in the Morning he went to the Fairy's
Park, where he found his faithful Slave, who, ac∣cording
to his Master's Orders, had brought four of
his Horses. The Prince waited a little, when the
lovely <HI>Irolita</HI> came wearied, and leaning on <HI>Mana;</HI>
for that young Princess endured so much in the
Walk, that Love alone, without <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Cruel∣ties,
and the ill Qualities of Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> would
not have been capable to have made her undertake
it. It was then Summer, the Night was clear, and
the Moon and Stars shined so bright, that it was
as light as Day. The Prince made up in haste to∣wards
her, kiss'd her Hand, for 'twas not a place
to talk in, and helped her on her Horse, for she rid
wonderfully well, it being one of her Amusements
to take horse with her Maids, and ride into a little
Wood, some distance from the Castle, which the Fairy
suffer'd her to take the Air in. Afterwards <HI>Parcinus</HI>
mounted his Horse, and <HI>Mana</HI> and the Slave theirs.
Then the young Prince, drawing the brilliant Sabre
the Fairy gave him, swore to the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> to a∣dore
her all his Life, and to die, if necessary, in
her defence. After these words they went away,
and the Zephirs seem'd to correspond with them,
or to take <HI>Irolita</HI> for <HI>Flora,</HI> by always attending
them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Day discover'd to <HI>Danamo</HI> a
piece of News she little expected. The Ladies who
were about <HI>Irolita,</HI> were amazed that she slept so
long; but obeying the order the prudent <HI>Mana</HI> had
given them the night before, durst not go into the
Princess's Chamber till she call'd them. <HI>Mana</HI> lay
in the same Chamber with <HI>Irolita,</HI> from whence they
went out at a little Back-door that let them into a
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
Court of the Palace, very little frequented, by a
Door that was in <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Closet, and was made up;
but in two or three Nights they found out the
means to open it. In short, the Queen sent for
<HI>Irolita;</HI> in obedience to the Fairy, they knock'd at
the Princess's Chamber-door, and no body answer'd.
But when the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> arrived, who came to
conduct the Princess to the Queen, he was very
much surprized; he broke open the door, and went
in, and seeing the little Door in the Closet forced,
he no longer doubted of the Princess's Flight.
When the News was carried to the Queen, she
shaked with Anger, and order'd them to search
every where for <HI>Irolita;</HI> but it was all in vain, no
body could give any account of her. The Prince
<HI>Brutus</HI> himself went to seek after her, and sent the
Fairy's Guards with all speed on the Roads he
thought they might take. In the mean time, <HI>Azira</HI>
observed that <HI>Parcinus</HI> did not appear in this general
Consternation; and Jealousy opening her Eyes, she
sent in haste to him, and began to think that
Prince had taken <HI>Irolita</HI> away. The Fairy herself
could not believe it; but upon consulting her Books,
she found <HI>Azira</HI>'s Suspicion to be matter of fact. In
the mean time, that Princess having learn'd that
<HI>Parcinus</HI> was not in his Apartment, nor the Palace,
sent to the Castle where <HI>Irolita</HI> had been so long, to
see if she could find any thing whereby she might
justify or condemn the Prince. The prudent <HI>Mana</HI>
had taken care to leave nothing that might discover
<HI>Irolita</HI>'s Correspondence with <HI>Parcinus;</HI> but <HI>Azira</HI>'s
Scarf, which was found on the Couch he swooned
on, and had been untied while he was in that con∣dition;
and which neither the Prince, nor <HI>Mana,</HI>
who were full of Grief, perceiv'd. What did not the
haughty <HI>Azira</HI> feel at the sight of that Scarf? Her
Love and Pride suffer'd both alike; she afflicted her∣self
to excess, and sent all the Servants of <HI>Irolita</HI> and
the Prince to Prison. The Ingratitude the Queen
thought <HI>Parcinus</HI> had shew'd her, push'd her natural
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
Rage to the last extremity. She would willingly
have given one of her Kingdoms to have been re∣venged
of those two Lovers, who at the same time
were pursued on all sides: Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his
Troop met with fresh Horses every where by the
Fairy's Order, whereas those of <HI>Parcinus</HI> were tired,
and answer'd not the Impatience of their Master.
At the further side of a Forest he overtook them:
the first Motion of the Prince was to go and fight
that unworthy Rival; he was riding up to him with
his Sabre drawn, when <HI>Irolita</HI> cry'd out, “Prince,
seek not an unprofitable Danger, obey the Orders
of the Fairy <HI>Favourable.</HI>” These words gave a
check to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Rage, who, to obey the Prin∣cess
and the Fairy, wish'd the Princess was in safe∣ty
against the Persecutions of the cruel Queen.
He had scarcely made this Wish, but the Earth
open'd between him and his Rival; a little ugly
Man, magnificently dress'd, appear'd, and made a
sign to him to follow him. The Descent was easy
on their side, he went down on horseback, with
<HI>Irolita,</HI> and <HI>Mana,</HI> and the Slave, and the Earth
closed. <HI>Brutus,</HI> surprized at so extraordinary an
Event, went in haste to give <HI>Danamo</HI> an account of
it; and in the mean time our young Lovers fol∣low'd
the little Man thro a dark Road, that led to
a large Palace, lighted by a great many Flambeaux
and Lamps. They alighted from off their Horses,
went into a prodigious large Hall, supported by
Pillars of shining Earth, cover'd with Ornaments
of Gold; a little Man, loaded with Jewels, sat on
a Throne of Gold at the bottom of the Hall, with
a great number of People like himself about him,
who conducted the Prince to that Place: who, as
soon as he appear'd with the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> the
little Man rose from his Throne, and said to him,
“Come, Prince, the great Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> who
has been a long time one of my Friends, hath de∣sired
me to secure you against the Cruelties of
<HI>Danamo.</HI> I am King of the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> you and the
<PB N="351" REF="252"/>
Princess are welcome to my Palace” <HI>Parcinus</HI>
thank'd him for his Assistance. The King and
all his Subjects were enchanted at the Beauty
of <HI>Irolita,</HI> they took her for a Star that came to
lighten their Abode, and served up a magnificent
Entertainment. The King of the <HI>Gnomes</HI> paid them
all manner of Respect; and harmonious Concert, but
somewhat wild, was the Diversion of the Night,
where they sang the Charms of <HI>Irolita,</HI> and repeated
several times these Verses:
<Q><L>What Star is this that thus our Sight invades,</L>
<L>And darts such Beams on these our gloomy Shades?</L>
<L>Which, while its Lustre fondly we admire,</L>
<L>Dazzles our Eyes, and sets our Hearts on fire.</L></Q></P>
<P>After the Musick was done, they led the Prince
and Princess, each into a magnificent Room, and
<HI>Mana</HI> and the faithful Slave follow'd them. The
next day they shew'd them the King's Palace, who
disposed of all the Riches of the Earth; nothing
could be added to that Treasure, which was a con∣fused
Mass of fine things unformed. The Prince
and Princess remained eight days in this subterra∣neous
Abode: <HI>Favourable</HI> had order'd the King of
the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> during that time, to make the Prin∣cess
and her Lover gallant and magnificent Enter∣tainments.
The Night before their Departure, the
King, to immortalize the Memory of their Resi∣dence
in his Empire, had their two Statues erected
in Gold on each side his Throne, on Pedestals of
white Marble; with these words writ in Letters
of Diamonds on the Pedestal of the Prince's Statue:
<Q><L>We desire no more the sight of the Sun;</L>
<L>We have seen this Prince,</L>
<L>Who is brighter, and more beautiful.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253"/>
And on the Pedestal of the Princess's Statue:
<Q><L>To the immortal Honour</L>
<L>Of the Goddess of Beauty,</L>
<L>Who descended here,</L>
<L>Under the Name of <HI>Irolita.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The ninth Day the Prince had very fine Horses
given him, whose Trappings were of Gold, laid o∣ver
with Diamonds, and left, with his small Troop,
the dark Abode of the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> after having paid his
Acknowledgments to their King, and found himself
in the same place where Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> attack'd
him; and looking on his Ring, perceived only the
Silver and the Brass. He pursued his way with the
charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> and hasten'd to arrive at the Ha∣bitation
of the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> where they were to
be in safety: when all on a sudden coming out of
a Vale, they met with a Troop of <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Guards,
who were still in search after them, and were just
ready to fall on them; when the Prince wish'd,
and presently there appear'd a great space of Wa∣ter
between them and the Fairy's Troop. A beau∣tiful
Nymph, half naked, rose up in the middle of
the Water, in a Boat of Rushes laced together,
and making towards the Shore, desired the Prince
and his beautiful Mistress to come into it; who,
with <HI>Mana</HI> and the Slave, left their Horses in the
Field, and went into the Boat, which sunk under
Water, and made the Guards think they chose ra∣ther
to drown themselves, than fall into their
hands. Immediately they found themselves in a
Palace, the Walls of which were great Drops of
Water, which falling continually, made Halls,
Chambers, Closets, and encompass'd Gardens, where
a thousand Spoutings of Water, of odd Figures,
form'd the Design of Parterres. None but <HI>Naids</HI>
could live in this Palace, so fine and singular as it
was; therefore to afford the Prince and the fair
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
<HI>Irolita</HI> a more solid Habitation, the <HI>Naid▪</HI> that con∣ducted
them, carried them into Grotto's of Shell∣work,
composed of Coral, Pearls, and all the Riches
of the Sea. Their Beds were of Moss, a hundred
Dolphins guarded <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Grott, and twenty Whales
the Prince's. The <HI>Naids</HI> admired, at their Return,
the Beauty of <HI>Irolita;</HI> and moreover, a <HI>Triton</HI> grew
jealous of the Prince's Looks and Care: They gave
them in the Prince's Grotto a Collation of fine
Fruits; twelve <HI>Syrens</HI> came to charm, by their sweet
Voices, the Trouble of the Prince and <HI>Irolita,</HI> and
sung the following Song:
<Q><L>Wherever Love our Heart conveys,</L>
<L>He makes us happy diff'rent ways:</L>
<L>Perfect Lovers, triumph in your Chains,</L>
<L>And let your Passions still surmount your Pains.</L></Q></P>
<P>At night there was an Entertainment, consisting
wholly of Fish, of an extraordinary Size, and ex∣quisite
Taste. After this Repast, the <HI>Naids</HI> danced
in Habits of Fish-Scales, of different Colours, which
was very fine; Bodies of <HI>Tritons,</HI> with Instruments
unknown to Men, composed a Symphony, which was
odd, but new, and very agreeable. <HI>Parcinus</HI> and
the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> were four Days in this Empire; the
fifth Day the <HI>Naids</HI> came in Crouds to conduct the
Prince and Princess; which two Lovers went into
a Boat of one entire Shell, and the <HI>Naids,</HI> half out
of the Water, accompanied them to the River-side,
where <HI>Parcinus</HI> found his Horses again, and set for∣ward
with speed: when looking on his Ring, he
perceived only the Brass; but they were then nigh
<HI>Favourable</HI>'s Palace. They travelled three Days,
when on the fourth, at Sun-rising, they perceived
Men in Arms, who, when they came near, appear'd
to be the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Troop, whom <HI>Da∣namo</HI>
had sent again to pursue them, with Orders
not to leave them if they found them, nor to stir
off the spot, where any thing extraordinary should
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
fall out; and above all, to endeavour to engage the
Prince to fight. <HI>Danamo</HI> knew very well, after
what <HI>Brutus</HI> had told her, that a Fairy protected
the Prince and Princess; but her Knowledge was
so great, that she despaired not of overcoming them
by more powerful Charms. Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> overjoy'd
to see the Prince and <HI>Irolita</HI> again, whom he sought
after with so much diligence, rid with his Sword
in his hand up to <HI>Parcinus,</HI> to endeavour to fight
him, according to <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Orders. The young
Prince drew his Sword with so fierce an Air, that
<HI>Brutus</HI> repented more than once of his Undertaking;
but <HI>Parcinus,</HI> perceiving <HI>Irolita</HI> all in Tears, moved
with Compassion at that sight, made his fourth Wish,
and presently there arose a great Fire up to the
Skies, which separated <HI>Parcinus</HI> from his Enemy.
This Fire made Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Troop fall
back. The young Prince and <HI>Irolita,</HI> who were al∣ways
attended by the faithful Slave and <HI>Mana,</HI>
found themselves in a Palace, the sight of which,
being all Fire, at first frighten'd <HI>Irolita;</HI> but she was
soon encouraged, when she perceived she felt no
greater Heat than that of the Sun, and that this
Fire had only the flaming Quality, and not those
others, which render it insupportable. A great
many young and handsome Persons, richly clothed,
came from whence the Flames seem'd to rise, to
receive the Princess and her Lover. One of them,
whom they judged to be the Queen of that Place,
by the Respects paid to her, said, “Come, charm∣ing
Princess, and you lovely <HI>Parcinus,</HI> you are in
the Kingdom of the <HI>Salamanders;</HI> I am the Queen,
and with pleasure am charged by <HI>Favourable</HI> to
conceal you seven Days in my Palace: I wish
only your Abode here was to be longer.” After
these words she carried them into a large Apart∣ment,
all of Fire, like the rest of the Palace, and
which gave as great a Light as the Sun. That
Night they supped with the Queen, and had a no∣ble
Entertainment; after it was over, they went
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
on a Terrass, to see an artificial Fire of wonderful
Beauty, and a very singular Design, which was pre∣pared
in a great Court before the <HI>Salamander</HI>'s Pa∣lace.
Twelve Loves were on Pillars of Marble, of
different Colours; six of them seem'd ready to
draw their Bows, and the six others held out a
great Plate, whereon these Words were writ in
Characters of Fire:
<Q><L>Where'er fair <HI>Irolite</HI> appears,</L>
<L>A glorious Conquest there she bears:</L>
<L>Our raging Flames, and hottest Fire,</L>
<L>Fall short of what her Eyes inspire;</L>
<L>So great's the Torment of Desire.</L></Q></P>
<P>The young <HI>Irolita</HI> blush'd at her own Glory, and
<HI>Parcinus</HI> was overjoy'd that she was thought as
handsome as she appeared to him. In the mean
time the <HI>Cupids</HI> drew their Arrows of Fire, which
crossing in the Air, form'd in a thousand places
the Cypher and Name of <HI>Irolita,</HI> and carried it
up to the Heavens. The seven Days they stay'd
in this Palace were spent in Pleasures and Diver∣sions.
<HI>Parcinus</HI> observed, that all the <HI>Salaman∣ders</HI>
had a great deal of Spirit, and a charming
Vivacity, were all gallant and amorous, and that
the Queen herself was not exempt from that Pas∣sion,
since she was in love with a young <HI>Salaman∣der</HI>
of extraordinary Beauty. The eighth Day they
left, with regret, an Abode so agreeable to their
Tenderness, and found themselves in a fine Field;
where <HI>Parcinus,</HI> looking on his Ring, found on the
four Metals mix'd together, these words engraved:
<Q>You wish'd too soon.</Q></P>
<P>These words afflicted the Prince and young Prin∣cess,
but they were so nigh <HI>Favourable</HI>'s Habitation,
that they hoped to reach it that day. This Thought
suspended their Grief, they went forwards, calling
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
on Fortune and Love, too often deceitful Guides.
The Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> following the Fairy's Orders,
never stirred from the Place where the Fire sepa∣rated
them, but lay encamped behind a Wood,
when his Sentinels, who kept continual Watch, in∣form'd
him that the Prince and Princess appeared
on the Plain again. He mounted his Troop, and
came up by night with the unfortunate Prince and
divine <HI>Irolita. Parcinus</HI> was not in the least dismay'd
at the great number of those who attacked him all
at once; he flew on them with a Courage that
terrify'd them: “I fulfil my Promise, fair <HI>Irolita,
said he, drawing his Sabre;</HI> I will die for you, or
deliver you from your Enemies.” After these
words, he struck the first he met, and fell'd him at
his feet; but, Oh Grief unexpected! that Sabre
which he had of the Fairy, broke into a thousand
pieces. 'Twas what the Fairy expected from the
Combat with the young Prince, for when she gave
any Arms, she charm'd them in such a manner,
that when they were made use of against herself,
they should break at the first Blow into a thousand
pieces. <HI>Parcinus</HI> thus disarm'd, could not long re∣sist
the Numbers that surrounded him; they took
him, loaded him with Chains, and made the young
<HI>Irolita</HI> undergo the same Fate. “Oh! Fairy <HI>Favoura∣ble,
cry'd the Prince melancholily,</HI> abandon me to all
the Rage of <HI>Danamo,</HI> but save the fair <HI>Irolita.</HI>” “You
have disobey'd the Fairy, <HI>answer'd a young Man of
surprizing Beauty, who appeared in the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> you must
endure the Punishment; if you had not been so
prodigal of <HI>Favourable</HI>'s Assistance, we had preser∣ved
you against the Cruelties of <HI>Danamo.</HI> The
whole Kingdom of the <HI>Silphes</HI> are vex'd that they
had not the Glory of rendring so charming a
Prince, and so beautiful a Princess, happy.” After
this he disappear'd. <HI>Parcinus</HI> groan'd at his Impru∣dence;
he appear'd insensible of his own Misfor∣tunes,
but was cruelly agitated with those of <HI>Iro∣lita:</HI>
and the Regret of having contributed to them,
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
had made him to die away for Grief, if Fate had
not prepared more cruel Torments for him to un∣dergo.
The young <HI>Irolita</HI> shewed a Courage wor∣thy
her illustrious Blood; and the merciless <HI>Brutus,</HI>
far from relenting at so moving a sight, redoubled
their Calamities, which he was partly the cause of.
He separated them, and deprived them of the plea∣sure
of complaining to each other without redress.
After a cruel Journey, they arrived at the wicked
Fairy's, who expressed a malign Joy to see the
Prince and young Princess in a condition so wor∣thy
of creating Pity in any other Breast but hers;
however, <HI>Azira</HI> had some for <HI>Parcinus,</HI> but durst not
shew it before the Fairy: “I will, <HI>said that cruel
Queen, addressing herself to the young Prince,</HI> have the
pleasure of revenging myself on thy Ingratitude;
go, instead of ascending the Throne my Bounty
designed you, to the Prison of the Sea, where I
will put an end to thy miserable Life by the most
horrible Punishments.” “I chuse rather the most
wretched Prison, <HI>reply'd the Prince, looking on her
fiercely,</HI> than the Favours of so unjust a Queen:”
Which words provoked her much more, who ex∣pected
to have seen him prostrate at her feet. She
made him be carried away to the appointed Prison:
<HI>Irolita</HI> cry'd in seeing him go, <HI>Azira</HI> could not retain
her Sighs, and all the Court groaned secretly at so
cruel an Order. For the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> the Queen sent
her to the Castle where she had been kept so long,
had her carefully guarded, and used her as inhuman∣ly
as she was capable of.</P>
<P>The Prince's Prison was a Tower in the midst
of the Sea, built on a small Desart Isle: there he
was kept loaded with Irons, and underwent all
imaginable Hardships. What a Place was this for
a Prince fit to rule the whole World? The remem∣brance
of <HI>Irolita</HI> was his sole Employ; he called on
<HI>Favourable</HI> only to her Assistance, and wish'd a thou∣sand
times to die, to expiate the Crime he had
committed; his faithful Slave was put into the same
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
Prison, but had not the Satisfaction of serving his
illustrious Master, who had none but rude Soldiers
about him, devoted to the Fairy; who, tho obe∣dient
to her, could not but respect the unhappy
Prince. His Youth, Beauty, and above all his Cou∣rage,
touched them with an Admiration, that made
them look on him as a Man superior to all others.
The prudent <HI>Mana</HI> was treated in the Castle with
<HI>Irolita,</HI> in the same manner as the faithful Slave.
None but <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Creatures came nigh the Prin∣cess,
who, by her Order, excited in her a fresh
Grief every moment, by telling her what the Prince
suffered. The Calamities of <HI>Parcinus</HI> made the
Princess sometimes forget the remembrance of her
own, and renewed her Tears in a Place where she
had so often heard that charming Prince swear to
her an eternal Fidelity: “Alas! <HI>said she to herself,</HI>
why was you so constant, my dear Prince, indeed
your Infidelity would have cost me my Life; but
what signified that? you would, after that, have
been happy.” <HI>Danamo,</HI> who took some time to
prepare a Charm of extraordinary force, sent <HI>Irolita,</HI>
in the morning, two Lamps; one of Gold, the o∣ther
Chrystal; the Golden one was lighted. <HI>Da∣namo</HI>
ordered her not to let one of those two Lamps
go out, but told her, “She might keep which she
pleased lighted.” <HI>Irolita</HI> answer'd, with her natural
Sweetness, She should obey her, without search∣ing
into the signification of it. She carried the
two Lamps carefully into her Closet, and as the
Golden one was lighted, she put it not out all that
day, and lighted the other the next day, and so
continued to obey the Fairy. She had kept these
Lamps fifteen days, when her Health began to di∣minish,
which she thought might be occasioned by
her Grief; but when they told her <HI>Parcinus</HI> was
very ill, her piercing Grief, and violent Oppression,
raised pity in all the Women about her. One
night, when they were all asleep, one of them
went softly to the Princess, and seeing the Chrystal
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
Lamp burning: “What is it you do, Great Prin∣cess?
<HI>said she to her,</HI> put out that fatal Light, your
Health depends upon it, preserve a Life so valua∣able
from the Cruelties of <HI>Danamo.</HI>” “Alas! <HI>re∣ply'd
the melancholy</HI> Irolita, <HI>in a languishing Air,</HI> she
has made it so miserable, that 'tis a kind of fa∣vour
in the Fairy to afford me the means of putting
an end to it: but, <HI>continued she presently after, with
an Emotion that brought a Colour in her Face,</HI> whose
Life does that golden Lamp prevail over?” “<HI>Parci∣nus</HI>'s,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Danamo'<HI>s Confidant,</HI>” who spoke to the
Princess by her Order; for that wicked Fairy had
a mind to torment her, by letting her know how
cruel her Fate was. At this News the Grief of
having herself taken care to put an end to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s
days, made her lie some time insensible; but when
she came to herself, and, in recovering her Senses,
resumed her Sorrows, “Odious Fairy, <HI>said she, when
she had power to speak,</HI> barbarous Fairy! Is not my
Death sufficient to appease thy Rage? but to be
more cruel, thou must destroy, by my hands, a
Prince so dear to me, who is deserving of the
tenderest and most perfect Love. But Death, a
thousand times more kind than thou, will shortly
deliver me from all the Mischiefs thy Rage in∣vents,
against a Passion so violent and faithful.”
The young Princess cry'd continually over the fa∣tal
Lamp, on which <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Life depended, and
lighted none but her own, which she saw burn
with Joy, as a Sacrifice she offered up to her Love
and Lover. All this time that unhappy Prince was
tormented with Punishments his Courage could not
support: The Fairy made the Soldiers who guarded
him, and feigned to be sensible of that illustrious
Prince's Sorrows, tell him, “That <HI>Irolita</HI> had con∣sented
to marry the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> in a few days
after he was put into Prison, and that that Prin∣cess
seemed very well content with her Marriage,
at all the Feasts that were made to celebrate it; and
in short, that she was gone away with her Hus∣band.”
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
This was a Misfortune the Prince did not
expect, and was the only one that could be greater
than his Constancy: “What, my dear <HI>Irolita,</HI> are
you unfaithful to me, <HI>said the sad Prince,</HI> to be
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI>'s? You have only bewailed my
Misfortunes, you have thought only of putting
an end to those my Tenderness caused you: but
live happy, ungrateful <HI>Irolita;</HI> I adore you, un∣constant
as you are, and will die for my Love,
tho not permitted the honour of dying for my
Princess.” Whilst the unfortunate <HI>Parcinus</HI> was
thus afflicting himself, and the tender <HI>Irolita</HI> was
wasting her Life to prolong her Lover's, <HI>Danamo</HI>
was affected with <HI>Azira</HI>'s Despair, who died away
for Grief at the Hardships of <HI>Parcinus:</HI> In short,
the cruel Fairy perceiving, that to save her Daugh∣ter's
Life, she must pardon the Prince, suffered her
to go to see him, and to promise him all he should
name if he would marry her, and at the same time
resolved to have put <HI>Irolita</HI> to death, as soon as the
Prince had accepted the Propositions. The hopes
of seeing <HI>Parcinus</HI> again, gave the melancholy <HI>Azira</HI>
new Life; the Queen bid her send to <HI>Irolita</HI> for the
Lamp, that she might be sure it did not burn:
which Order seemed more cruel than all the rest to
the sorrowful <HI>Irolita.</HI> How great was her Unea∣siness
for the Life of <HI>Parcinus?</HI> “Be not so con∣cerned
for the Life of that Prince, <HI>said the Women
to her, who were about her,</HI> he is going to marry
the Princess <HI>Azira,</HI> and 'tis she who, careful of
his Life, sends for the Lamp.” The Torment of
Jealousy, which was wanting among all her Mis∣fortunes,
never, till after these words, had any
share in her Calamities. Nevertheless <HI>Azira</HI> went
to see the Prince, and offered herself and Kingdoms
to him, pretending to be ignorant that he had heard
of <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Marriage with <HI>Brutus;</HI> by which Exam∣ple
she would have convinced him, he had carried
his Constancy too far. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> to whom nothing
was valuable but his beloved <HI>Irolita,</HI> preferred his
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
Prison and Sufferings before Liberty and Empire.
<HI>Azira</HI> despaired at his Refusal, and her Grief ren∣dered
her equally unhappy as that Prince.</P>
<P>During this time the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> who till
then had boasted of the Insensibility of her Heart,
was not able to resist the Charms of a young Prince
in her Court, who was in love with her; and this
Fairy could not have resolved to listen to him, had
not the Pride of her Soul been overcome by the
Violence of her Passion: in short, she yielded to
the desire of letting him know how he triumphed.
The pleasure of speaking to what we love, seemed
then so charming to her, and so worthy of being de∣sired,
that approving what she had blamed so much,
she came in haste to the assistance of <HI>Parcinus</HI> and the
fair <HI>Irolita.</HI></P>
<P>Had she staid a little longer, it would have been
too late, the fatal Lamp of <HI>Irolita</HI> had but six days
to burn, and the Grief of the unhappy <HI>Parcinus</HI>
had almost put an end to his days. <HI>Favourable</HI> ar∣rived
at <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Palace, and as her Power was su∣periour
to hers, she would be obeyed in spite of
the wicked Fairy. The Prince was fetched out of
his Prison, from whence he would not stir, till he
was assured by <HI>Favourable,</HI> that the fair <HI>Irolita</HI> might
still be his. He appeared, for all his Paleness, as
handsome as the Day, and went with the Fairy <HI>Fa∣vourable</HI>
to the Princess's Castle, whose Lamp cast but
a glimmering Light. The dying <HI>Irolita</HI> would not
consent to have it put out, till she was assured of the
Fidelity of her happy Lover. No Words or Ex∣pressions
are lively and tender enough to give an
Idea of their Joy to see each other again. <HI>Favou∣rable</HI>
made them instantly resume their former
Charms, and endowed them with a long Life and
constant Happiness; but for their Tenderness she
had nought to add to that. <HI>Danamo</HI> outrageous to
see her Authority defeated, killed herself, leaving
the Fate of <HI>Azira</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> entirely to <HI>Irolita,</HI> who
took no other revenge than marrying them both
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
together. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> as generous as constant, ac∣cepted
only of his Father's Kingdom, and left those
of <HI>Danamo</HI> to <HI>Azira.</HI> The Nuptials of the Prince
and Divine <HI>Irolita</HI> were solemnized with great Mag∣nificence;
and after having paid their Acknowledg∣ments
to <HI>Favourable,</HI> and rewarded the Slave, and
prudent <HI>Mana,</HI> they set out for their Kingdom;
where the Prince, and lovely <HI>Irolita,</HI> enjoyed the
Happiness of a Passion, as tender and constant in
their Prosperity, as it was violent and faithful in
their Adversity.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MArthonida</HI> had no sooner made an end of her
Story, but all the Company commended it.
“Well, <HI>said Madam</HI> de Rouet, I am charmed and
surprized at the gallant Turn of <HI>Marthonida</HI>'s Wit.”
“Indeed, <HI>added Madam</HI> de Lure, <HI>in her affected way,</HI>
I am not so unhappy in coming into this Country,
as I thought I should be; for in short, I could
not believe that there was an Ounce of good Sense
in the whole Province.” “Upon my word, <HI>said
Madam</HI> de St. Thomas, <HI>with some impatience,</HI> you
<HI>Paris</HI> Ladies set us off at a fine rate, when you
think us such Fools.” “It is the most erroneous
Opinion in the World, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, it is
enough to see you, and hear you talk, to make a
more sound Judgment; for to be sincere with
you, all that I have known at Court must yield
to the illustrious Ladies here.” “I have some
Thoughts, dear Cousin, <HI>added the Widow,</HI> to settle
here, and would be glad to meet with a pretty
Estate, that I might purchase.” “How much, Ma∣dam,
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
<HI>said the Baron,</HI> would you lay out?” “That,
<HI>said she,</HI> depends entirely upon the Title; I should
be glad it was a Marquisate, and should be wil∣ling
to give seven thousand Franks.” “Seven thou∣sand
Franks! <HI>reply'd the Viscount;</HI> surely, Madam,
you don't think as you speak.” “Why, Sir, <HI>cry'd
she,</HI> can a Marquisate in the Country be worth
more? They give them away at <HI>Paris,</HI> and know
not what to do with them. For my part, I must
own, I shall be almost ashamed to be a Marchio∣ness;
I have much ado to resolve on it: but if
you know of one, I should be very much obliged
to you, if you would tell me, because I have Mo∣ney
by me, which I don't know how to lay out.
Indeed, I might buy a Palace at <HI>Paris,</HI> but as I
am so well known in that City, and at Court, I
should be exposed to more Visits than I could well
dispense with.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible, Madam, <HI>said the Prior,</HI> that you
can think of having a Palace for seven thousand
Franks, when we can hardly have a thatch'd
House here for that Price.” “Oh! Mr. Prior, <HI>said
Madam</HI> de Lure, I see you don't know how much
that is, and it will be losing one's labour to tell
you.” “You are certainly in the right there, <HI>re∣ply'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>in the most malicious Air he could
affect;</HI> these Abbots will be always meddling, and
oftentimes they know not what they say.” “There
I think you have Monsieur le Prior,” <HI>said the Vis∣count,
smiling.</HI> “Indeed he has, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> but I could
not have expected it from my Friend <HI>Dandinar∣diere;</HI>
but now-a-days we sacrifice a Friend at any
time for a Joke's sake.” “For my part, <HI>said</HI> Vir∣ginia,
I am not of that stamp, I would have People
be attentive to every thing.” “Ah! fair <HI>Virginia,
said the Gentleman-Cit,</HI> I am undone, and more than
undone, if you are against me; the Ascendant that
Heaven has given you over me is so great, that I
am not able to resist when you attack me: Alas!
the Power you have over me has appear'd but too
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
much, since I have been in this House. I was
brought here, dear Cousin, <HI>said he, addressing him∣self
to Madam</HI> de Rouet, by the most strange and
surprizing Adventure that could happen to a Man
of Quality, which I'll tell you in particular; for
it would be unjust to tire these Ladies with the
Recital. What I have to tell you, is, that I have
an Enemy not far off, who employs Fire and
Sword, and all manner of Enchantments, against
me.” “What's this you tell me? <HI>cry'd the Widow;</HI>
I am frighten'd at this Prelude.” “These Gentle∣men
and Ladies, <HI>reply'd the Cit,</HI> can justify what
I advance, and can tell you, at the same time,
with what Courage I behaved myself in all these
Insults; no Rock was ever more firm than I have
been, which makes my Enemy despair: in short,
he has endeavour'd to vanquish me by the most
unheard-of Treasons.” “Upon my word, Sir, <HI>said
Madam</HI> de Lure, I wish I had not at this time
seen you, for I dread so much, lest any Misfor∣tune
should befal you, that I shall not get one
wink of Sleep this Night.” “My Fate is to be
envy'd then, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>gallantly;</HI> me∣thinks
I have nothing to fear, since you are in∣terested
in my Fortune.” “Here are Ladies, <HI>said
the Viscount, pointing to</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Marthonida,
who assuredly bear no less a share with you; and
if Monsieur <HI>Villeville</HI> pretends to use you ill, have
perhaps power enough to put a stop to his Vio∣lences.”
“Who is that you are speaking of?” <HI>said
the Widow.</HI> “A Gentleman of Merit, <HI>said the Vis∣count,</HI>
was he not an Enemy to our Friend here.”
“Indeed, I have seen him, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> and now per∣fectly
remember him.” “You remember him! <HI>an∣swer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>knitting his Brows,</HI> you now
joke with me; he is a Clown I would make no
comparison with: and I am surprized, that a
Woman so well dress'd as you are, can allow a
Man of that stamp to be tolerable.” Madam <HI>Rouet,</HI>
who had secretly an Inclination for <HI>Villeville,</HI> finding
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
herself sensibly touch'd, reply'd in a deriding man∣ner,
“And pray who are you, good Monsieur <HI>Dandi∣nardiere?</HI>
Does your Removal from <HI>St. Dennis-Street</HI>
to the Sea-side authorize you to call all Mankind
Scoundrels?” “Ha! Madam Mushroom, <HI>cry'd he,
as red as Fire,</HI> truly it does not become you of all
People to talk against me; without my Mo∣ney
your Father would have narrowly escaped
the—” “What Insolence is this! <HI>said she,</HI> my
Father suffer'd by your Breaking.” In short, the
Dispute began with so much Warmth on both sides,
that the Gentlemen, thinking it might be carried
too far, and fearing lest Madam <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who
was always upon the Enquiry, should discover the
true Original of our Cavalier, and learn more than
they would have her, endeavour'd all they could
to make a Peace; and with them, Madam <HI>de Lure</HI>
was very earnest to reconcile them, for she would
not for ever so much have it said in the Country, that
she kept Company with a Citizen. But this Quarrel
of the Widow's and <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s was got already
to a great height; however, out of Manners and
Respect due to the Intreaties of their Friends, they
held their tongues, tho their Rage plainly disco∣ver'd
itself by their Eyes, and several Reflections
pass'd backwards and forwards, without mentioning
any Names.</P>
<P>The Baron at last, thinking it would be the best
way to part them, to that end said, “I believe,
Ladies, it will not be amiss, if we should take a
Turn or two into the Wood, where we diverted
ourselves in the Morning.” “Upon my word, <HI>said
the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dow,</HI> the Situation is infinitely agreeable; I
love the Sea to distraction, and very much approve
of the Custom of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who marry it
every year: and was I the Doge's Wife, I would
marry it too, or at least make some Alliance or
Friendship with it.” After this Speech she rose
up, without once looking upon <HI>Dandinardiere;</HI> and
catching hold of Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI>'s Arm, said
<PB N="266" REF="267"/>
to her, “Come, let us recreate ourselves by this
ungovernable Elements's side.” The Baroness up∣on
this pulled her Arm hastily away, and told her,
she was able enough to support herself, without
making her her Leaning-stock. The Widow, who
was not a little out of humour at her Cousin the
Cit, thought herself affronted by the Baroness, and
made answer, “Indeed, there are some People in
the World, who instead of offering Roses, present
nought but the Prickles.” “O! I understand you,
<HI>said the Baroness, with an haughty Air;</HI> you are
the Flower, and I the Thorn. Well, if you are
a Rose, it is, I am sure, a fading one.” “You are
very insulting, Madam, <HI>answer'd the Widow, colour∣ing;</HI>
had I thought of this Reception, some Mira∣cle
must have been wrought to have made me
have done you the honour of a Visit.” “It is
what I could very well have excused,” <HI>said the Ba∣roness,</HI>
(who was resolved to have the last word.)
“Indeed, my Dear, <HI>said the Baron,</HI> you have a great
mind to vex me to-day.” “I know you, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
she, raising her Voice,</HI> I know you would take
the great <HI>Turk</HI>'s part, if it was but against me;
but a separate Maintenance will make me easy.”
The Goddess of Discord herself seem'd to him to
have taken up her Residence that day at his House,
for there was nothing to be heard but Wranglings
and Differences; however, Monsieur <HI>St. Thomas</HI>
made his Wife no Answer, but engaged the Ladies
to go into the Wood, leaving the Baroness and <HI>Dan∣dinardiere</HI>
together, who at that time agreed ex∣traordinarily
in their Sentiments of Madam <HI>Rouet.</HI>
“Well, <HI>said Madam</HI> St. Thomas, will you give me
leave to speak my mind freely to you.” “Oh!
you do me too much honour,” <HI>reply'd the Cit.</HI> “Then,
<HI>answer'd she,</HI> I must needs say, your Cousin is a
very impertinent Creature.” “My Cousin, <HI>reply'd
he;</HI> O Madam, she is nothing related to me, we
are only Cousins—You understand me.” “If
I do, <HI>said she,</HI> I have more Understanding than any
<PB N="267" REF="268"/>
Woman in <HI>Europe</HI> besides, to guess at an entire
History, without one single Syllable's being men∣tioned.”
“Oh! how happy is a Man, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan∣dinardiere,
to have a Wife of so much Merit; if
Heaven had given me such a one, I should have
adored her as much as the <HI>Chinese</HI> worship their
<HI>Pagods:</HI> I should kiss her little Toes, and gnaw
her Mittons.” “But you see, <HI>said the Baroness,</HI> how
my Husband uses me; I must tell you, Monsieur
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> there is not a Man in the World so
incomplaisant as himself, for tho he appears sweet
and agreeable, in the bottom he is but four. For
my part, I was born and bred with a Politeness,
which such ill Usage cannot be pleasing to.” “I
believe as much, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere; any one may
have my Soul, by using soft and obliging Expres∣sions:
but if I am dealt roughly with, I am as hard:
as Iron; all the Devils in Hell, Fairies, Sorcerers,
and Magicians, can never make any thing of me.
Ha! I love you for that, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> you are exactly
of my Temper, we certainly were fashioned by
the same Model: But to return to what you told
me, what, is not this Widow your Relation?”
“Good God! no, Madam, <HI>reply'd he, somewhat angry,</HI>
I have told you No once, and tell you so again.
One of her Uncles had the Care of my House,
and when she was young and handsome, she used
often to come and see him: and as I was young
too, I used to tell her fine Stories.” “Oh! fy, fy,
Sir, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> I would not have such a Woman
brag that she knows me for all the World; and
I'll go and tell her this minute, that if she ever
names me, I'll sit as close to her as her Shift
to her Back.” “You take things too literally, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Cit,</HI> I don't pretend to cast any Reflection
upon Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI>'s Virtues, what I meant was
in relation to her Quality and mine: for, Ma∣dam,
if we come to be so strict in this point, that
all Women were to give as good Proofs of their
Lives and Conversation, as the Knights of <HI>Maltha</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
do of their Nobility, the virtuous Ladies might
live by themselves. Come, we must not be un∣charitable.”
“Since your Maxims and mine, Mon∣sieur
<HI>Dandinardiere, said Madam</HI> St. Thomas, are
grounded upon different Principles, you will not
take it amiss if I don't believe you.” “Good God!
<HI>said he,</HI> would you upon this fall out with your
Husband?” “Yes, <HI>said she,</HI> you yourself can't but
have seen how he carry'd it with the Cit; I al∣ways
love to speak my Mind, and between you
and I, I believe he has been acquainted with her
a long while.”</P>
<P>As they were talking thus friendly together, <HI>A∣lain</HI>
came in, and interrupted them, gaping and
staring as if he had been stuck, which surprized his
Master; but after some little pause, he went close
to him, and whispering him in the Ear, bid him
to prepare for the other World, for that <HI>Villeville</HI>
was in the Wood laughing and prating, as if he
was in no fear of him; that himself was hid be∣hind
a Tree, from whence he could easily see him;
and that he was grown half a Yard taller than he
was before. The Baroness observing, that the News
<HI>Alain</HI> brought disturbed the Tranquillity of <HI>Dandi∣nardiere</HI>'s
Countenance, told him, that perhaps she
might be troublesome, and so left him, not a little
pleased at her absence. As soon as she was gone,
and he found himself at liberty, he asked his Va∣let,
if he was sure he had seen <HI>Villeville.</HI> “Don't
flatter yourself, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> that I was mistaken,
for I saw him as plain as I now see my own Foot;
and I'll tell you the whole Story: When these
Ladies came out of your Chamber, I was in the
dark Passage, and heard one of them say to the
Gentlemen,” “He is a sorry Fellow, a Tradesman
in <HI>St. Dennis-Street,</HI> with whom I used, some time
since, to lay out some Money; but of late he has
had a great Inclination to counterfeit a Man of
Quality, and so makes sport: and as I buy a
great deal upon Credit, I divert myself with him,
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
and call him Cousin, to get the more time, for
we Court-Ladies have not always ready Money.
With a great many more things, <HI>said</HI> Alain, which
I cannot remember.” “I find thy Memory is only
good at these sort of Stories,” <HI>answer'd his Master.</HI>
Indeed, Sir, <HI>continued</HI> Alain, I'd rather be hang'd
for a Fauxsonnier, than tell a Lye; for I am sure
I repeat the Words I heard as true as any Conju∣rer's
Book. But to return to these Ladies; I fol∣low'd
them very softly, and crept as close to them
as possible; and as they were chattering and pra∣ting,
they heard the trotting of a Horse, and
upon our looking behind us, who should appear
but that Hangtrace <HI>Villeville,</HI> who bow'd to them
to the very ground: in the mean time, I trem∣bled
like an aspin Leaf, and retired to inform
you.” “This is an Affair, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
that requires a great deal of Consideration; since
my Enemy appears so much hereabouts, and pas∣ses
and repasses every night and morning, to be
sure he has told the Widow, and she'll—Why,
<HI>Alain,</HI> why hast thou no Heart?” “And
what if I had one, Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> what should we
do?” “What I am very confident we never shall
do, <HI>said the Cit,</HI> for thou hast not Courage; what
signifies my laying Schemes then for thee to exe∣cute?
The best way will be to think of a Re∣treat.”
“That's well said, Sir, <HI>added</HI> Alain, lest
that desperate cutting and slashing Fellow, Mr.
<HI>Robert,</HI> should play us some trick.” “But what
shall we do, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere? for if they
should meet with us upon the Road, we are un∣done.”
“Have a little patience, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Alain;
I'll put you into our Cart, and cover you over
with your Books.” “Excellently well thought on,
<HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere; but first go again to the Place
where you saw <HI>Villeville,</HI> and come and tell me
whether he is there.” <HI>Alain</HI> obey'd, and crept up
by a dark shady Alley to the Place where the Com∣pany
were, but saw not his Master's dreadful Foe,
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
tho he looked carefully all abouts, and afterwards
returned to his Master, to tell him he had nothing
to fear, for that this terrible Myrmydon was gone.
No sooner did this joyful News reach his Ears,
but he cry'd out▪ “Let us go, and add fresh Lau∣rels
to those which adorn my Brow. Reach me
my Arms and my Boots, and go and saddle my
little <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> What! shall that impudent Var∣let
come where I am? I'll teach him to come
here.” <HI>Alain</HI> all this time looked upon his Master
with the utmost Amazement, but at last recovering
his Surprize, said, “Can it be proper to arm your∣self?
your Head is very bad, and your poor Shoul∣ders
have not yet recover'd the Damage from the
Adventure of the Bed.” <HI>Dandinard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere</HI> pretended
not to hear <HI>Alain,</HI> but minding to talk to himself,
said, “But to generous Souls, Virtue makes no ac∣count
of Years.” And then again, with more Spi∣and
Courage; “Shew yourselves, ye <HI>Navarrians,
Moors,</HI> and <HI>Castillans.</HI>” And so continued repeating
several Places of the <HI>Cid.</HI></P>
<P>While he was thus exercising himself for Bat∣tel,
he got armed, and then mounted his poor
Palefry, who was much gayer than his Master, by
having five or six days good Feed in his Belly;
and sallied out towards the Wood, with his Lance
in his hand, with which he beat all the Bushes as
he went along. The noise he made obliged the
Ladies to turn about, who were surprized at his
Equipage, and burst out a laughing, especially the
Widow, who, to shew her fine Teeth, set up a
hollow again. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> upon this, to signalize
himself, and to revenge the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffront, seeing her
Cornet, which was adorned with rose-colour'd Rib∣bands,
standing up very high, made no more to do,
but run his Lance into it, and not only carried it
away, but also a false Tower of fair Hair, which
she wore to conceal her fiery Locks, and left her
quite bare-headed. It may easily be thought she
was not a little enraged and vexed; she srkeamed
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
out terribly, while the Horse, frighten'd at the
Ribband<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that hung before his Eyes, and the Noise
she made, ran away with his Master; who could
not have stopped him, had not <HI>Villeville,</HI> who had
left the Company, and as he pass'd by stopped to
speak to Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> turn'd himself about, and see∣ing
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> in that danger, catch'd hold of the
Bridle: and making use of this opportunity to put
that Project in execution, which the Viscount, the
Prior, and himself, had concerted, he said to
him, drawing his Sword, “Well, Monsieur <HI>Dandi∣nardiere,</HI>
since we are thus fortunately met, let us
decide our Quarrel, and cut each other's Throat
genteelly.” Which struck such a Damp upon his
Spirits, that he was not able to open his Lips; es∣pecially
when he saw the Sword glittering before
his Eyes, he had like to have died away with the
Fright. At last, after a quarter of an hour's si∣lence,
he got out, “I will not fight when I am
in Armour; I am a Man of too much Honour, to
fight with so great an Advantage.” “Have-at-you
then, <HI>said</HI> Villeville, (clapping the point of his
Sword to his Throat.) Upon which <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
falling off his Horse, cry'd out,” “Oh! Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI>
I am dead; come and bleed me presently. Oh!
good dear Monsieur <HI>Villeville,</HI> don't kill me; I beg
my Life, and if this Habit of War displeases you,
I'll renounce it for ever.” “There's only one
thing, <HI>said</HI> Villeville, that can save you from my
Rage; I will give you your Life, provided you
will promise me to marry one of the Madam <HI>St.
Thomes's.</HI>” “Name which, <HI>said</HI> Dandinardiere, for
if you order me, I'll marry them both, and the
Father and Mother too.” “I leave you to your
own choice, <HI>said</HI> Villeville; but if you don't make
use of the Honour that I would procure for you,
depend upon it I'll kill you, if you are a hundred
foot under ground.” The Git, thinking himself
the happiest of all Men, to come off so well, got
up, shaking like one in an Ague, and cast himself
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
at the feet of his terrible Enemy, assuring him,
that he would neglect nothing, that lay in his
power to obey him in: and to shew his Submission,
ask'd to kiss his hand, which <HI>Villeville</HI> gravely held
out; telling him withal, that he thought it would
be most proper for him to ask <HI>Virginia</HI> of Monsieur
<HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who would be brought to give his con∣sent
the more easily. When he saw that he had
forgiven him, and that they were Friends; “You
shall now prescribe me Laws, <HI>answer'd the Cit,</HI>
and I'll agree to whatever you negotiate.” <HI>Ville∣ville,</HI>
fortified with this Promise, returned back a∣gain,
and taking the Viscount and Prior aside, told
them, that there was no occasion to bring Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert</HI>
upon the Stage, and to contrive a Meeting for
himself and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> since Chance had effected
what they might have found more difficult than
they imagin'd; and then told what had happen'd.
These two Gentlemen were not a little pleased at
this News, and resolved, without losing any time,
to conclude the Marriage; but were in some em∣barassment,
lest the Widow, upon this account,
should submit to a Reconciliation with her Cousin,
and advise him to the contrary; till <HI>Villeville</HI> in∣form'd
them, that he had some Ascendant over her,
and would let her into the Secret; assuring them,
that she would be overjoy'd at this Mark of Con∣fidence,
and would second them in their Project.
And accordingly he goes to her, while the Vis∣count
discoursed Monsieur <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who receiv'd
the Proposal agreeably enough. As for Madam <HI>St.
Thomas,</HI> she consented to it by a Fit of Caprice,
which seldom lasted long, and <HI>Virginia</HI> received it
with Joy, being prepossess'd that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was
a Hero, that had performed several noble Exploits.
So that they, who had all been, as one may say,
at Daggers-drawing some hours before, were very
good Friends. When <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> came to them,
he trembled, and was as pale as death; every one
received him with open Arms, and endeavoured to
<PB N="273" REF="274"/>
make him forget the Catastrophe attending his
Combat. In short, he demanded <HI>Virginia</HI> in form,
was favourably received, and the Viscount propo∣sed
to return in a doors, to draw up the Articles.
But how great was poor <HI>Alain</HI>'s Astonishment, to
see the Wolves and Lambs herding together, mean∣ing
<HI>Villeville</HI> and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who embraced one
another every minute, and were continually sha∣king
hands. He stood stock still, gaping and staring
like one frighten'd; but when he was told that his
Master was to marry <HI>Virginia,</HI> and that his Happi∣ness
was entirely owing to the Management of
Monsieur <HI>Villeville,</HI> he went singing, jumping, and
dancing about the House, just out of his Senses.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was disarmed by young Madam <HI>St.
Thomas</HI> like another Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> and bedecked
with Flowers, every one calling him by some merry
Name or other; till the Baron, who began now to
be interested himself, desired the Viscount, Prior,
and <HI>Villeville,</HI> to look upon him as one who was to
be his Son-in-Law. From that very night, Turkeys,
Chickens, Ducks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> went all to the Spit and
Pot, for Monsieur <HI>St. Thomas</HI> was at all the Ex∣pences
of the Wedding, which was all the Portion
the Cit was to have with his Wife, besides the
knack of making Stories, which might be inherited
by their Posterity. However, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was sa∣tisfied,
or at least pretended to be so, out of his
Dread of <HI>Villeville,</HI> without whom the Match had
never been brought to bear. And after some days
of Mirth and Feasting, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> took his Wife
home, accompanied with her Sister; and left <HI>Alain,</HI>
with his Cart and Asses, behind, to bring his
Study.</P>
