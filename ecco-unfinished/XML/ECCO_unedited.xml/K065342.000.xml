<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Treatise
may in some Measure,
claim the Honour of
Your Lordship's Patronage, as
being undertaken in Obedience
to Your Commands, and con∣taining
<PB REF="3"/>
part of those Discourses,
I had with your Lordship, when
you allow'd me the Honour, to
talk with you on <HI>Philosophical
Subjects;</HI> Tho' Your Lordship's
uncommon Advances, even in
the more abstruse parts of <HI>Geo∣metry,</HI>
and <HI>Natural Knowledge,</HI>
have made you so great a <HI>Ma∣ster</HI>
of Reasonings of this kind,
that I am not capable of offer∣ing
any thing to You worthy
Your own Perusal; yet did but
the Performance, answer the
Dignity of the Subject, I shou'd
not think it, unworthy of Your
Lordship's Protection.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
Such has been Your Lordship's
happy <HI>Genius,</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> in
Your Studies, that Your great
Progress in the nobler parts of
<HI>Philosophy,</HI> has not retarded
Your deep Inquiries, in the Know∣ledge
of <HI>civil Government;</HI> nor
Your <HI>universal Learning</HI> ren∣dred
you more unfit for an active
Life, and doing good to Man∣kind.
It was the peculiar Wis∣dom
of the <HI>Antients,</HI> to lay such
Foundations both for <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI>
and for <HI>Business,</HI> that
they left it to their Stars to de∣termine,
which of the two shou'd
afford them Occasion, to become
most useful to Mankind. What
<PB REF="5"/>
Provision Your Lordship has laid
in for the first, if others know not
as I do, it is because they have
not had Occasion to Discourse
with You on Subjects of Learn∣ing.
And the Queen's Choice, is
an undoubted Proof of Your Ca∣pacity
for the other. Her Ma∣jesty
having put You, in the most
difficult Post of the Government of
Your Country, I wou'd say too,
in the most difficult Times, if any
thing could be reckon'd so, for
the present Reign.</P>
<P>It was Your Lordship's Opi∣nion,
that the <HI>Providence of
the Almighty Governour of
the Universe,</HI> had reserv'd to
<PB REF="6"/>
this last Age, those great
Advantages, by which the Se∣crets
of Nature have been more
happily unravell'd, than in
any former Times, on pur∣pose,
to expose the Folly of a cor∣rupt
Generation of Men, who
from their vitious Practices,
being prone to <HI>Atheism,</HI> have
vainly pretended, the <HI>Oracles of
Reason</HI> to be on their side. And
upon the same account, I cannot
but look upon Your Lordship as
a singular <HI>Blessing,</HI> as well as
an <HI>Ornament</HI> to Your Country,
who are a <HI>Living Exemple,</HI> that
true <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Probity</HI>
go Hand in Hand, and that
<HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI> receive
<PB REF="7"/>
additional <HI>Lustre</HI> from one ano∣ther.
But, because I would not
offend Your Lordship's darling
Vertue, Your <HI>Modesty,</HI> I shall
choose to transgress against
the common Rules of Dedica∣tions,
and shall not presume, to
mention, either Your <HI>Birth,</HI> or
<HI>Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Breeding,</HI> or <HI>Tem∣per,</HI>
or which is more valuable,
that <HI>Probity</HI> and <HI>Candor</HI> that
shines in all You say or do, but
shall only make good Wishes, sup∣ply
the Place of a just <HI>Enco∣mium.</HI></P>
<P>May Your Lordship be as
happy in your Administration,
as the Motives upon which you
<PB REF="8"/>
accepted it, were Just and Ho∣nourable.
May you be as easie
in your Office, as you are to all
the World in your <HI>Temper.</HI>
And as your noble Mind, has
secur'd you from mean and nar∣row
Prejudices; May your In∣tegrity
protect you from unjust
Malice; May your Endeavours
for settling the Peace and Hap∣piness
of your Country, be as
successful, as your Love to it is
sincere.</P>
<P>These, my Lord, are the only
Returns, I can make your Lord∣ship,
for the many Favours I
have receiv'd from you, and
this small <HI>Treatise</HI> is the only
<PB REF="9"/>
Present I have to offer you; of
which however, I beg your Lord∣ship's
Acceptance, and that your
Lordship wou'd believe, that no
one can Honour you more, than</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
Your Lordship's
most humble, and
most obliged Servant,

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE End and Design of these
Discourses, may be gathered
from the <HI>Title Page,</HI> and the
<HI>Contents;</HI> and I have alrea∣dy
hinted, what gave the Occasion and
Rise to them, <HI>viz.</HI> the Commands and
Conversation of that <HI>noble Person,</HI> to
whom they are inscribed. As for the Ma∣terials,
some of them I borrowed from
the Works of those Learned Men, I have
had Occasion to be conversant in; others
I had, by a little reflexion on my Subject.
If any one think, I have made free with
their Inventions, without doing Justice to
their <HI>Names,</HI> I give every Man Liberty to
lay in his own Claim, and assert his just
Right, for I industriously avoided all
Quotations, because my Subject wanted
<PB REF="11"/>
not <HI>Authorities,</HI> but <HI>Demonstration.</HI> Some
part of the Matter was furnished me
from Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s Store, and his Inven∣tions
have such peculiar Marks, as will
distinguish them, even in my rude Dress,
without particular <HI>Innuendo's.</HI> For what
concern'd the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> besides,
<HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini,</HI> that <HI>Friend</HI> to Mankind,
my constant good Friend, Dr. <HI>Archibald
Pitcairn</HI> his <HI>Dissertations</HI> supply'd me the
most plentifully. I borrowed but little,
from those who have written on the same
Subjects with my self, both to avoid Re∣petitions,
and because they generally went
on Principles (tho' just and demonstrative)
yet of a different Nature from mine.</P>
<P>If I have had the Misfortune, to differ
in some few <HI>Philosophical</HI> points, from
some great and deserving Men, I hope
they will have the Goodness to pardon
me, having treated their Opinions, with
all the <HI>Candor</HI> and <HI>Regard</HI> due to their
<HI>Merits,</HI> without mentioning their <HI>Names;</HI>
and a <HI>mannerly</HI> Liberty in <HI>Philosophical</HI>
points, is allow'd to ev'ry Body.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>
That these Sheets have not many more
Faults than they have, is owing to the Judi∣cious
Corrections and Advices, of the <HI>Reve∣rend</HI>
and <HI>Excellent Mr. John Craig,</HI> and the
Learned, <HI>Dr. Arbuthnott Physician to his Roy∣al
Highness,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> of <HI>Christi Church
Oxford.</HI> Men sufficiently eminent in the
Common-Wealth of Learning, not to
want any Paneygrick from me.</P>
<P>If I am not over fond of my Subject, I
think I may say, a Treatise on it was wan∣ted,
I wish there may not be Occasion of
saying so still. If my Performance excite
others, of more Leisure and Capacity to
do it the Justice it deserves, I have ob∣tain'd
the end of my Ambition.</P>

common Subject of Dis∣course
than <HI>Nature</HI> and its
<HI>Laws;</HI> and yet, however Use has made
these Words familiar, there are few that
agree in their Notions about them: The
Reason of which seems to be, that these
Terms imply <HI>Notions</HI> so compounded, and
so far remov'd from the Knowledge of
<PB N="2" REF="35"/>
most Men, that there are scarce any that
distinctly conceive all the Simple <HI>Ideas</HI> that
enter their Composition; I shall not pre∣tend
to settle the Signification of these
Words in their utmost extent; it will be
enough to my present purpose, to give
the Sense I shall apply to them in the fol∣lowing
Discourse.</P>
<P>§ II. By <HI>Nature,</HI> I understand this vast,
if not infinite <HI>Machin</HI> of the <HI>Ʋniverse,</HI> the
Perfect and Wise Production of Almighty
God, consisting of an infinite Number of
lesser <HI>Machins,</HI> every one of which is ad∣justed
by Weight and Measure. By the
<HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> I mean, those Laws of
Motion by which natural Bodies are go∣vern'd
in all their Actions upon one ano∣ther,
and which they inviolably observe
in all the Changes that happen in the na∣tural
State of things. But here we are to
distinguish between the Laws of <HI>Creation</HI>
and those of <HI>Nature,</HI> for not only the great
Bodies of this Universe, but the inferiour
<HI>Machins</HI> thereof, were created by a different
Law from what they, are now govern'd,
<PB N="3" REF="36"/>
as shall afterwards be more fully ex∣plain'd.</P>
<P>§ III. That there is no such thing as
an <HI>Universal Soul</HI> animating this vast Sy∣stem
according to <HI>Plato,</HI> nor any <HI>Substan∣tial
Forms</HI> according to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> nor any
Omniscient <HI>Radical Heat</HI> according to <HI>Hip∣pocrates,</HI>
nor any <HI>Plastick Virtue</HI> according
to <HI>Scaliger,</HI> nor any <HI>Hylarchic Principle</HI> ac∣cording
to <HI>Henry More,</HI> is evident from
the following Considerations; 1. These
are meer <HI>Allegorical</HI> Terms coin'd on pur∣pose
to conceal their Author's Ignorance.
When the <HI>Philosophers</HI> cou'd not account
for the appearances of Nature, they were
so far from owning any want of Know∣ledge,
that to keep up their Credit with
the thoughtless and credulous part of Man∣kind,
they attributed these unaccountable
Effects to unintelligible Beings of their
own Contrivance, which neither had Foun∣dation
nor Existence in Nature: But who∣ever
will give themselves the least trouble
to consider the Matter, will plainly see, that
they really meant nothing by those ama∣zing
<PB N="4" REF="37"/>
Terms, but to disguise their own Ig∣norance
2. These Beings are derogatory
from the Wisdom and Power of the <HI>Au∣thor</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> who doubtless can govern
this <HI>Machin</HI> he cou'd create, by more di∣rect
and easie Methods, than employing
these subservient <HI>Divinities,</HI> 3. The Ap∣pearances
themselves, to salve which they
were contriv'd, may be by more intelli∣gible
and less indirect Principles accounted
for, as in some measure shall be afterwards
shown. 4. Lastly, These very <HI>Beings</HI> will
not serve the design of their Creation, un∣less
we endow 'em with Powers and Fa∣culties
above the Dignity of such secondary
Agents.</P>
<P>§ IV. The <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> which
seems most agreeable to the Wisdom of
its Author, is (supposing the <HI>System of
the Universe</HI> already created) that he has
settled Laws, and laid down Rules, con∣formable
to which, Natural Bodies are go∣vern'd
in their Actions upon one another,
and according to which, the Changes in
the material part of this <HI>System</HI> are brought
<PB N="5" REF="38"/>
about which all Bodies inviolably observe,
and which of themselves naturally acting,
they never transgress in the least degree,
whilst <HI>God Almighty</HI> preserves them in their
Faculties and Operations. This Great <HI>Ma∣chin</HI>
of the <HI>Universe,</HI> may in some degree
be liken'd to a finish'd Piece of Clock-Work,
form'd upon <HI>Geometrick</HI> Principles,
which naturally, and of it self (as long
as the Parts are kept together) will go
on in the same constant tenour of Motion,
unless disturb'd by some external Force;
the Movements of this Clock-Work de∣pend
upon those General Rules, according
to which, one Part communicates its Mo∣tion
to another, and are particularly de∣termin'd
by the Configuration of the se∣veral
Pieces of which it consists, I shall
not here consider the Actions of Beings,
that have a Power of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> nor even
of those that have <HI>Self-Motion,</HI> such as are
all Animal Agents; nor do I in the least
degree exclude the Government of <HI>God Al∣mighty</HI>
in this World. On the contrary,
my principal Design is to demonstrate his
<PB N="6" REF="39"/>
continued Providence from evident Princi∣ples,
and to convince the World, that he
not only has the Springs of this <HI>Great Ma∣chin,</HI>
and of its several Parts in his own
Hand, and is the first <HI>Mover;</HI> but that
without his continual Influence and Sup∣port,
the whole Movement would soon
fall to Pieces. Besides this, he has reserv'd
to himself the Power of Dispensing with
these Laws, when he pleases.</P>
<P>§ V. It is not my Design here to ex∣plain
all the particular <HI>Laws of Motion,</HI> and
of the Actions of Bodies upon one ano∣ther,
nor cou'd it be well done in so nar∣row
a Compass as I have proposed to my
self, I shall here only set down the Gene∣ral
<HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> which virtually include
these others, and infer such Conclusions
from 'em as I find most necessary for clea∣ing
some parts of the following Dis∣courses.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<PB N="7" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>LAW I.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Bodies persevere in the same
State of rest, or of moving for∣ward
in a strait Line, unless forc'd out of
that State by some outward impress'd Vio∣lence
<HI>i. e.</HI> all Bodies at rest will naturally,
and of themselves for ever continue in rest,
unless some external Cause put 'em in Mo∣tion:
And all Bodies in motion will na∣turally
move forwards for ever in the same
strait Line, unless they are stop'd by some
opposite Force, or turn'd out of their
Course by some differently directed Vio∣lence.</P>
<P>§ VI. To shew how inviolably this
Law is observ'd by natural Agents, we
need only consider it never has been ob∣serv'd
that any Body did of it self, bring
it self from Rest to Motion, nor that ever
any Body in Motion, brought it self to
Rest; Nor that ever any Body in Motion,
of it self altered its Course, but that
where ever such Changes happened, there
<PB N="8" REF="41"/>
were always evident Causes. If Bodies
chang'd their places of themselves, all
Things wou'd run into Confusion, nor
wou'd there be any certain Laws to regu∣late
the <HI>Motions</HI> of the Universe. We
are certain <HI>Projectils</HI> wou'd for ever move
on, in the same right Line, did not the
Air, their own Gravity, or the Ruggedness
of the Plane, on which they move, stop
their Motion; or did not some Body
with a different Direction alter their Course.
A Top whose parts, by their Cohesion,
hinder one anothers rectilinear Motions,
wou'd never cease to turn round did not
the Air, gradually impair its Motion.
Natural Bodies consist of a Mass of Mat∣ter,
which by it self can never alter its
State, and if Bodies are once at rest, they
must continue so, unless some new Force
put 'em in Motion. If in Motion, the
same Energy will continue 'em in Motion
and drive 'em forwards in the same Dire∣ctions.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="42"/>
§ VII. Moreover, there is in Matter
an unactive <HI>Principle,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
very well expresses by the <HI>vis inertiae,</HI>
whereby Bodies resist to the utmost of
their Power, any change or alteration of
their State, whatever it be, either of Rest,
Motion, or its Direction; And this Resistance
is always equal in the same Body,
and in different Bodies is proportional to
the quantity of Matter they contain.
There is required as much Force to stop a
Body in Motion, as is required to put it in
Motion, and <HI>è contrà;</HI> And therefore since
the same Body equally resists the contrary
equal Changes of its State, this Resi∣stance
will operate as powerfully to keep
a Body in Motion as to keep it at Rest,
and consequently of it self, it can never
change its State of Rest, Motion, or Dire∣ction;
for to change its Direction, is the
same thing as to move of it self another
way. Matter then of it self is so far in∣different
to Motion or Rest, that it is no
more inclin'd to the one than to the other,
and does no less Resist a change from Rest
<PB N="10" REF="43"/>
to Motion, than from Motion to Rest.
This <HI>vis inertiae</HI> is no where more conspi∣cuous
than in the sudden Motion of a
Vessel full of Liquor upon a Horizontal
Plane, at first the Liquor seems to move
with a Direction contrary to that of the
Vessel, not that there is really any such
Motion impress'd upon the Liquor, but
that the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> endeavouring to con∣tinue
it in its State of Rest, the Vessel
can't immediately communicate its Motion
to the Liquor; But the Liquor perseveres
in its State of Rest whilst the Vessel makes
forward and so seems to move a contrary
way. But when once the Liquor has
the Motion of the Vessel communicated to
it, and begins to move with a velocity
equal to that of the Vessel, if the Vessel
be suddenly stop'd, the Liquor continues
its Motion and dashes over the sides of the
Vessel.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="11" REF="44"/>
<HEAD>Corollary 1.</HEAD>
<P>§ VIII. Hence it is evident that no
Particle of Matter, nor any Combination
of Particles, <HI>i. e.</HI> no Body, can either move
of themselves, or of themselves alter the
Direction of their Motion; Matter is not
endow'd with Self-motion, nor with a
Power to alter the Course in which it is
put, it is meerly passive and must for
ever of it self continue in that State and
that Course that it is settled in; and indeed,
if it can't move of it self, it can never
alter its Course of it self when in Motion,
for to alter its Course of it self is only to
move of it self after a particular manner.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 2.</HEAD>
<P>§ IX. Hence it is Evident, that no
Body put in Motion will naturally, and of
it self move in a <HI>Curve Line.</HI> All Motion
is naturally forward in the same strait Line
with the Direction of the moving Force;
<PB N="12" REF="45"/>
but what ever moves in a Curve Line
must in every Point alter its Direction,
and therefore naturally of it self, no body
can move in a <HI>Curve Line.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 3.</HEAD>
<P>§ X. Hence the great Bodies of this
Universe the <HI>Planets,</HI> their <HI>Satellits</HI> and the
<HI>Comets</HI> do not naturally and of themselves
(tho' at first put in Motion) move in their
repective Orbits, which are <HI>Curve-Lines</HI> re∣turning
into themselves, but are kept in
by some attractive Force, which if once
suspended they wou'd for ever run out in
right Lines, and consequently the Motions
of these Great Bodies in their <HI>Orbits</HI> do abso∣lutely
depend upon this attractive Force,
whencesoever it arises.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 4.</HEAD>
<P>§ XI. Hence neither Motion nor Rest
(I mean not one of 'em particularly) is
essential to Matter. <HI>i. e.</HI> Matter is indiffe∣rent
<PB N="13" REF="46"/>
as to either of these particularly, and
does as much resist its being chang'd from
Rest to Motion, as it does the being
chang'd from Motion to Rest. And as
any Force will imprint some degree of Mo∣tion
on a quiescent Body, so the same de∣gree
of Force impress'd at the same time,
with a contrary Ditection, will bring it
to Rest again, but it is not necessary to the
<HI>Being</HI> of Matter; that it be in Rest or Mo∣tion,
for Matter will be still Matter in
which ever of these States it be.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 5.</HEAD>
<P>§ XII. Since then it is not essential to
Matter to be either in Rest or in Motion,
it is evident that the preservation of a
Body in Rest or in Motion (after the first
Instant) does absolutely depend upon
<HI>Almighty God</HI> as its Cause, no part of Mat∣ter
can move it self, nor when put in Mo∣tion,
is this Motion absolutely essential to
its being nor does depend upon it self, and
therefore the preservation of this Motion
<PB N="14" REF="47"/>
must depend upon some other Cause, but
there is no other Cause assignable, but
that Omnipotent Cause of the preservation
of the Being and Faculties of all natural
Agents. Now this Corollary does in no
manner interfere with the preceding Law,
as perhaps some may think, for by that
Law, the inability in Matter (arising
from its <HI>vis inertia</HI>) to change its State of
Motion, Rest, or Direction is declared,
whereas by this Corollary, the immediate
Cause of this <HI>vis inertiae</HI> is referr'd to, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Influence of the Divine Power, for
though by this <HI>vis,</HI> Bodies persevere in their
State of Motion, Rest and Direction, yet
this <HI>vis</HI> is not essential to Matter, but a po∣sitive
Faculty implanted therein by the Au∣thor
of Nature, as shall be afterwards
more fully explain'd.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 6.</HEAD>
<P>§ XIII. Hence the Necessity of a <HI>va∣cuum,</HI>
or space distinct from Matter, is
clearly demonstrable; for since by their
<PB N="15" REF="48"/>
<HI>vis inertiae,</HI> all Bodies resist to the utmost
of their Power, any Change or Alteration
of their State▪ whether of Motion or Rest.
And since the Resistance in the same Body
is always equal, or the same, and in dif∣ferent
Bodies is proportionable to the
Quantity of Matter they contain. And
since consequently, if two Bodies con∣taining
equal Quantities of Matter, and
moving with equal Celerities in contrary
Directions, so that they impinge directly
upon one another, will certainly both rest
or stop at the Point of their Concourse,
as also since it is demonstrable, that two
Bodies moving contrary wise with equal
Celerities, and both resting at their meet∣ing,
are equally Heavy; it necessarily fol∣lows,
that two Bodies containing equal
Quantities of Matter, are equally Heavy,
and therefore were there no Vacuities in
Bodies, two Spheres of equal Diameters,
should contain equal Quantities of Mat∣ter,
and consequently be equally Heavy,
<HI>i. e.</HI> two Spheres of equal Diameters, one,
of Gold, another of Wood, shou'd have
<PB N="16" REF="49"/>
the same specifick Gravities, which being
contrary to Experience, there is a Neces∣sity
of admitting Vacuities in the latter
Sphere to answer the Difference of their
Gravities.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>LAW II.</HEAD>
<P>§XIV. THE Changes made in the
Motions of Bodies are al∣ways
proportional to the impress'd moving
Force, and are produced in the same Di∣rection
with that of the moving Force.</P>
<P>Effects are alway proportionable to
their <HI>adequate</HI> Causes, and if any Degree
of Force produce any Degree of Motion,
a double Degree of the same Force will
produce a double Degree of Motion, and
a triple, a triple, and so on; and this
Motion must proceed in the same Dire∣ction
with that of the moving Force, since
from this only the Motion arises; and be∣cause
by the former Law, Bodies in Mo∣tion
cannot change their Direction of
<PB N="17" REF="50"/>
themselves, so that unless some new Force
alter its Course, it must proceed in the same
Direction with that of the moving Force.
And if the Body was before in Motion,
the Motion arising from this impress'd
Force, if in the same Direction, does so
much increase the former Motion; if it
has a contrary Direction, it destroys a
part of the former Motion, equal to that
which is impress'd; when it has a Dire∣ction
oblique to that of the former Motion,
it is either added to, or substracted from
the former Motion, according as the Mo∣tion
arising from a Composition of these
two, is determin'd.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary.</HEAD>
<P>§ XV. Hence it is evident, that in
the present Constitution of things, there
can be no perpetual Motion. By a perpe∣tual
Motion, I mean an uninterrupted
Communication of the same degree of
Motion from one part of Matter to another
in a Circle, not as Bodies put in Motion
<PB N="18" REF="51"/>
do for ever continue in the same, but in so
far as they are resisted or stop'd by other
Bodies, but a Circulation of the same
quantity of Motion, so that it perpetu∣ally
return undiminish'd upon the <HI>first Mo∣ver.</HI>
For by this Law, the Motion pro∣duc'd
is but proportionable to the genera∣ting
Force, and all Motions on this Globe
being perform'd in a resisting Fluid, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Air, a considerable quantity of the Mo∣tion
must be spent in the Communication,
on this <HI>medium,</HI> and consequently it is
impossible the same Quantity of Motion
shou'd return undiminished upon the <HI>first
Mover,</HI> which is necessary toward a per∣petual
Motion. Moreover, the Nature
of Material Organs is such, that there
is no avoiding a greater or lesser degree
of Friction, though the Machin be form'd
according to the exactest Principles of
<HI>Geometry</HI> and Mechanicks, there being no
perfect congruity nor exact smoothness in
Nature; the manner of the Cohesion of
Bodies, and the small proportion the solid
Matter bears to the vacuities in 'em, and the
<PB N="19" REF="52"/>
Nature of the constituent Particles of Bodies,
not admitting the same. Besides, how very
imperfect our most finished Mechanick Per∣formances
are, a very ordinary <HI>Microscope</HI>
will easily discover▪ Now these things
must very considerably diminish the com∣municated
Force, so that it is impossible
there shou'd be a perpetual Motion, unless
the communicated Force were so much
greater than the Generating Force, as to
recompence the dimunition made therein
by all these Causes, so that the impress'd
Motion may return undiminish'd to the
first <HI>Mover.</HI> But that being contrary to
this Law, it is clear that the Motion must
continually decrease, till it at last stop, and
consequently there can be no perpetual
Motion in the present State of Things.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<PB N="20" REF="53"/>
<HEAD>LAW III.</HEAD>
<P>§ XVI. REPULSE or Reaction
is always equal to Im∣pulse
or Action, or the Action of two
Bodies upon one another is always equal,
but with a contrary Direction, <HI>i. e.</HI> The
same Force with which one Body strikes
upon another, is return'd upon the first
by that other; but these Forces are im∣press'd
with contrary Directions.</P>
<P>Whatever presses or draws another, is
as much press'd or drawn by that other;
if one presses a Stone with his Finger, the
Stone presses his Finger again. It a Horse
draw forward a Stone by a Rope, the
Stone does equally draw back the Horse,
for the Rope being equally distended,
both ways acts upon both equally. If
one strike an Anvil with a Hammer, the
Anvil strikes the Hammer with equal
Force. The Steel draws the Magnet as
much as the Magnet does the Steel, as is
evident by making both swim in water;
<PB N="21" REF="54"/>
so in pulling a Barge to Land by a Rope,
the Bank pulls the Barge as much as the
Barge does the Bank; and in the descent
of heavy Bodies, the Stone attracts the
Earth as much as the Earth does the Stone;
<HI>i. e.</HI> the Earth gravitates toward the Stone,
as much as the Stone does toward the
Earth. And the Motions produc'd by
both these Gravitations, are equal in both,
only the Stone is altogether inconsiderable,
in respect of the Bulk of the Earth, and
consequently the Velocity of the Earth's
Motion toward the Stone is inconsiderable,
in respect of the Stone's Motion toward
the Earth, and therefore the Motion of the
Earth toward the Stone is insensible. And
Universally in all the Actions of Bodies,
if a Body act on another, and change its
Motion any manner of way, that other
will make the same Change in the Mo∣tion
of this Body with a contrary Dire∣ction,
so that by these Actions there are
made equal Changes, not of the Veloci∣ties
but of the Motion, for the Changes
made on the Velocities in contrary Dire∣ctions,
<PB N="22" REF="55"/>
are in a reciprocal proportion to
the Bodies.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 1.</HEAD>
<P>§ XVII. If a Body <HI>A,</HI> be impell'd by
two different Forces, one in the Direction
<HI>AB,</HI> with the Velocity <HI>M;</HI> another in
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the Direction <HI>AC,</HI> with the Velocity <HI>N,</HI>
make <HI>AB</HI> to <HI>AC,</HI> as <HI>M</HI> to <HI>N</HI> compleat
the Parolelogram <HI>ABCD,</HI> the Diagonal
of which is <HI>AD.</HI> The Composition of
both these Forces will make the Body de∣scribe
the Diagonal <HI>AD,</HI> and in the same
time as it would have described either of
the the Sides; for because the Force, whose
<PB N="23" REF="56"/>
Velocity is <HI>N,</HI> acts in the Direction <HI>AC,</HI>
parallel to <HI>BD,</HI> it will not in the least
hinder or destroy the Velocity in the other
Force, by which it tends to the Line <HI>BD.</HI>
Wherefore the Body will reach <HI>BD</HI> in
the same time, whether the Force, whose
Velocity is <HI>N,</HI> be impress'd or not, and
therefore in the end of this time it must
be found somewhere in <HI>BD,</HI> in like man∣ner,
the Force, whose Velocity is as <HI>M,</HI>
acts in the Direction <HI>AB,</HI> parallel to <HI>CD,</HI>
and therefore will not hinder the Velo∣city
in the other Force in proceeding to
<HI>CD,</HI> and the Body will reach <HI>CD</HI> in the
same time, whether the Force, whose Ve∣locity
is <HI>M,</HI> act or not, and consequently,
in the end of the same time, it must be
somewhere in <HI>CD,</HI> but it cannot be found
in <HI>BD</HI> and <HI>CD</HI> both; but at the Point
<HI>D</HI> therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 2.</HEAD>
<P>§ XVIII. From these Laws, and their
necessary Consequences, all the Rules of
<PB N="24" REF="57"/>
Bodies ascending or descending in verti∣cal
Lines, may be deduced, as also, the
Rules of the Congresses and Reflections
of two Bodies, as the <HI>Geometers</HI> have
shewn. From the preceding Corollary, the
Method of compounding and resolving
Motions in any given Directions may be
drawn, for Example, the Composition of
the direct Force <HI>AD,</HI> of any oblique ones,
such as <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>BD,</HI> as also the Reso∣lution
of the direct Force, into any ob∣lique
ones, such as <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>BD,</HI> as also
the <HI>ratio</HI> of an oblique Force to move a
Body, to chat of the same Force coming
with a perpendicular Direction to move
the same Body; for Example, let an ob∣lique
Force, as <HI>AC</HI> be impress'd upon the
Body <HI>E</HI> in <HI>C,</HI> at the Point <HI>C</HI> erect a per∣pendicular
<HI>CD,</HI> and from <HI>A</HI> let fall a per∣pendicular
upon <HI>CD,</HI> and another upon
<HI>CB;</HI> then by the former Corollary, the
Force <HI>AC</HI> may be resoved into the two
<PB N="25" REF="58"/>
Forces <HI>AD</HI> and <HI>AB,</HI> of which only <HI>AB</HI>
has any Energy to move the Body <HI>E;</HI>
wherefore the oblique Force as <HI>AC</HI> is to
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the same Force coming with a perpendicu∣lar
Direction, as <HI>AB</HI> to <HI>AC,</HI> or as the
sine of the Angle of Incidence <HI>AB</HI> to the
Radius <HI>AC.</HI> The same is true of the
Energy of an oblique Stroke upon the Body
<HI>E,</HI> to that of the same striking perpendi∣cularly.</P>
<P>From the same preceding Corollary, it
follows that if a Body <HI>A</HI> be impell'd or
drawn by three different Forces in three
different Directions <HI>AB, AE, AC,</HI> so that
the Body yields to none of 'em, but con∣tinues
<PB N="26" REF="59"/>
in <HI>aequilibrio,</HI> these three Powers
are to one Another as three right Lines
drawn parallel to their Directions, and ter∣minated
by their mutual Concourses. If
<HI>AD</HI> represent the Force by which the Body
<HI>A</HI> is impell'd from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>B,</HI> then will the
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
same <HI>AD</HI> represent the contrary equal
Force, whereby it is impell'd from <HI>A</HI> to
<HI>D.</HI> But by the former Corollary a Force,
as <HI>AD</HI> impelling from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D</HI> is equi∣pollent
to two others, acting in the Dire∣ctions
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> to which the other
impelling from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D,</HI> is as <HI>AD</HI> to
<HI>AC,</HI> and <HI>AE</HI> or <HI>CD,</HI> respectively. So
likewise two Forces acting in the Dire∣ctions
<PB N="27" REF="60"/>
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> and being equipollent
to the Force Acting in the Directions
<HI>AD,</HI> from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D</HI> will be to the
Force acting according to the Direction
<HI>AD,</HI> from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D,</HI> as <HI>AC, AE</HI> to <HI>AD;</HI>
and therefore the Forces acting in the Di∣rections
<HI>AC</HI> and <HI>AE,</HI> and equipollent to the
Force acting in the Direction, <HI>AD</HI> are to
this Force acting in the Direction <HI>AD,</HI> as
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> or <HI>CD</HI> to <HI>AD,</HI> that is, if a
Body be urg'd by three different equi∣pollent
Powers in the Directions <HI>AB,
AC, AE,</HI> these three Forces shall be to
one another as <HI>AD, AC, CD</HI> respective∣ly,
<HI>q. e. d.</HI> and this single Proposition is
the Foundation of all the Mechanicks, as
several <HI>Geometers</HI> have expresly shown; so
that it is plain, these three Laws do vir∣tually
comprehend all the Rules of Me∣chanism,
and consequently, if any appea∣rance
contradict these Laws, or their ne∣cessary
Consequences, it is not to be Me∣chanically
accounted for. So then in our
future Inquiries, we have nothing to do
to show any thing is Immechanical, or
<PB N="28" REF="61"/>
not according to the establish'd Laws
of Nature; but clearly to evince, that it
contradicts some of these Laws or their
Corollaries.</P>

<HEAD>Corollary 3.</HEAD>
<P>§ XIX. Hence it follows that a Body
can't move constantly in an <HI>Orbit,</HI> with
the same Degree of Motion from one sin∣gle
impress'd Force. If it move in an
<HI>Orbit,</HI> let a <HI>Polygon</HI> be inscrib'd in it, then
since the Angles of this <HI>Polygon</HI> are Ob∣lique,
the Degree of the Motion of the
Body moving in this <HI>Polygon,</HI> must de∣crease
at every <HI>Angle</HI> in proportion to the
Sine, of the <HI>Angle</HI> of Incidence, (supposing
the <HI>Radius</HI> always the same) by the for∣mer
<HI>Corollary;</HI> but every <HI>Orbit</HI> is equivalent
to a <HI>Polygon</HI> of an infinite Number of <HI>An∣gles,</HI>
and consequently the Degree of Mo∣tion
and Velocity arising from one single
Impulse, must continually decrease by a
Body's moving in an <HI>Orbit,</HI> and so must
at last be quite spent, and the Body will be
at rest.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="29" REF="62"/>
<HEAD>Corollary 4.</HEAD>
<P>§ XX. Hence there can be no perpe∣tual
Motion arising from one single Im∣pulse,
for this Motion must be propa∣gated
in an <HI>Orbit,</HI> that it may return upon
the first <HI>Mover,</HI> and if so, it must conti∣nually
decrease, and at last stop.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 5.</HEAD>
<P>XXI. Hence it is evident, that the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
and their <HI>Satellits,</HI> the <HI>Comets</HI> and the
other Celestial Bodies do not move in
their <HI>Orbits</HI> (tho' we shou'd suppose 'em
solid) by the Force of one single Impulse,
but are kept kept in by some other
Powers. We see these Bodies do continue
their Motions without any sensible Alte∣rations,
which they cou'd never do if they
mov'd only by the Force of one single
Impulse. Let us then Enquire how it
comes about, that these Bodies do perse∣vere
in their Motions, and do constantly
<PB N="30" REF="63"/>
move round in the same Tracts, with∣out
making the least Deviation; now, that
can happen but one of these two ways,
<HI>viz.</HI> Either by the Force of some <HI>Celestial</HI>
Fluid (call'd a <HI>Vortex</HI>) which carries 'em
about, or by some <HI>Retentive Central Force</HI>
which hinders 'em from runing out in
strait Lines, when they are once put in
Motion by the Fingers of him who fram'd
this marvellous <HI>Machin</HI> of a World.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In order to account for the
<HI>Celestial</HI> Appearances, <HI>Des Cartes</HI> supposes
the Matter of this Universe to have been
at first divided by Almighty God, into in∣numerable
little equal Parts, each endow'd
with an equal Degree of Motion, both
about its own proper <HI>Center,</HI> and seperat∣ly
among themselves, so as to constitute
a Fluid; as also that several Collections of
these Parts, were endow'd with a Motion
about different Points (at equal Distances)
as common <HI>Centers,</HI> so as to compose dif∣ferent
<HI>Vortices,</HI> and that these Parts being
made round by such intestine Motions, did
produce <HI>Globules</HI> of different Magnitudes,
<PB N="31" REF="64"/>
which he calls the Matter of his <HI>second
Element;</HI> as also that the small Raspings
and Fileings of the Angular Points of these
<HI>Globules</HI> driven violently many different
ways, did make up the Matter of his <HI>first
Element;</HI> and seeing there wou'd be more
of this <HI>first Element</HI> than was sufficient to
fill the Vacuities between the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the <HI>second Element,</HI> he supposes that the
remaining part wou'd be driven toward the
<HI>Center</HI> by the Circular Motion of these <HI>Glo∣bules,</HI>
which did for that reason recede
from it; and being there amass'd in a
Sphere, wou'd in the <HI>Center</HI> of every <HI>Vor∣tex</HI>
produce a Body like the <HI>Sun;</HI> that the
Sun being thus fram'd, and moving about
its own <HI>Axe</HI> with the Motion of the rest
of the Matter of the <HI>Vortex,</HI> wou'd neces∣sarily
throw out some Parts of its Matter
through the Vacuities of the <HI>Globules</HI> of the
<HI>second Element,</HI> which constitute the <HI>Vortex,</HI>
especially at these Places which are distant
from its <HI>Poles,</HI> receiving by these <HI>Poles</HI> as
much as it loses about the <HI>Eccliptick,</HI> and
by this wou'd be able to carry round with
<PB N="32" REF="65"/>
it these <HI>Globules</HI> which are nearest, with
the greatest Velocity, and the remoter with
a less; and that so of necessity these <HI>Globules</HI>
that are nearest the <HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> would
be least, for were they greater or equal,
they wou'd by reason of their Velocity,
have a greater centifrugal Force, and there∣fore
recede from the <HI>Center.</HI> Now shou'd
it happen that any of these <HI>Sun-like</HI> Bodies
in the <HI>Centers</HI> of the several <HI>Vortices</HI> shou'd
be so incrustated and weaken'd, as to be
carried about in the <HI>Vortex</HI> of the true <HI>Sun,</HI>
if it were of less Solidity, or less capable
of Motion than the <HI>Globules,</HI> towards the
extremity of the <HI>Solar Vortex,</HI> then it wou'd
descend toward the <HI>Sun,</HI> till it met with
<HI>Globules</HI> of the same Solidity, and capable
of the same Degree of Motion with it, and
being fixt there, it wou'd for ever be car∣ried
about by the Motion of the <HI>Vortex,</HI>
without either approaching to, or receding
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and so become a <HI>Planet.</HI>
Supposing this true then, we may imagine
our <HI>System</HI> to have been at first divided
into several <HI>Vortices</HI> in the <HI>Center,</HI> of which
<PB N="33" REF="66"/>
was a lucid, spherical Body, and that some
of these being gradually incrustated, were
swallow'd up by others, more powerful
and bigger, till at last they were all de∣stroyed
and carried away by the biggest
<HI>Solar Vortex,</HI> except some few that were
thrown of in right Lines from one <HI>Vortex</HI>
to another, and became <HI>Comets.</HI> Hence it
appears that the <HI>Planets</HI> that are nearest the
<HI>Sun,</HI> are least solid, which is <HI>Des Cartes</HI>'s
Reason, why the <HI>Moon</HI> shows always the
same Face to us, because that <HI>Hemisphere</HI>
that is opposite to the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> is
somewhat more solid than the other. As
also that the Matter of the <HI>first Element,</HI>
which makes up the Body of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
moves with greater Velocity the Parts of
the <HI>Vortex,</HI> and the Bodies swiming there∣in,
that are nearest it, than those that are
remoter, which is the reason why the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
next the <HI>Sun,</HI> finish their Periods sooner
than those that are more remote; and that
these <HI>Planets</HI> move about their own <HI>Axes,</HI>
because they were <HI>Sun like,</HI> lucid, and re∣volving
Bodies before.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="67"/>
§ XXIII. Now not to mention the
many Defects in the Mechanical Produ∣ction
of this immaginary <HI>System,</HI> I shall
only take Notice (as Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has) of
the known <HI>Celestial</HI> Appearances it contra∣dicts;
and the Absurdities wou'd follow,
tho' we shou'd allow the Author all that
he wou'd have granted. And, 1. It is
certain that a <HI>Vortex</HI> produc'd by the Re∣volution
of a <HI>Sphere,</HI> about a giv'n <HI>Axis,</HI>
wou'd be propagated <HI>in infinitum,</HI> if nothing
did hinder it; and seeing there must be
as many such <HI>Vortices</HI> as there are fixt Stars,
one <HI>Vortex</HI> wou'd necessarily run into ano∣ther,
and every Particle wou'd be acted
by a Motion compounded, of the Motions
of all the <HI>Central Spheres,</HI> which is ab∣surd
and contrary to that Constancy and
Limitation observable in the Celestial Ap∣pearances.
2. Since the Motion of the
Parts of the <HI>Vortices</HI> nearest the <HI>Center</HI> is
swifter than that of the more remote, they
will press upon the exterior Parts, and
thereby perpetually communicate some
part of their Motion to them, and there∣fore
<PB N="35" REF="68"/>
these interior parts of the <HI>Vortex,</HI> will
be continually losing some part of their
Motion, which never being restored, these
parts must gradually move slower, till at
last the Motion is quite destroy'd. 3. Ac∣cording
to this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> each <HI>Planet</HI> is
of the same Density with the parts of the
<HI>Vortex</HI> in which it swims, and is govern'd
by the same Laws of Motion, and is as it
were, only concreted parts or the <HI>Vortex:</HI>
Now the times of the periodical Motion,
of Bodies, carry'd about by a <HI>Vortex</HI> are
in duplicat proportion of the Distances
from the Center; whereas the Squares of
Times of the periodical Motions of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> are as the Cubes of the Distances
from the <HI>Center;</HI> and consequently the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
cannot be carry'd about by a <HI>Vortex.</HI>
4. If a <HI>Vortex</HI> run out <HI>in infinitum,</HI> then a
Body carry'd round by it, wou'd certainly
describe a perfect Circle, unless something
solid did hinder it, and therefore, the greater
Distance there were between these solid
Bounds, or the larger the Bason be which
contains the <HI>Vortex,</HI> in respect of th <HI>Orbit</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="69"/>
of the Body carry'd about in it, the nearer
wou'd this Orbit approach to a Circle.
<HI>i. e.</HI> The Excentricity of the <HI>Planets</HI> nearest
the <HI>Sun,</HI> would be less than that of those
more remote, the contrary of which is
true, for that of <HI>Mercury</HI> is greater than
that of <HI>Saturn.</HI> Moreover, since the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
in this <HI>Vortex</HI> wou'd necessarily move
in Orbits nearly similar to that of the sides
of the containing Bason, it wou'd follow
that the <HI>Aphelia</HI> of all the <HI>Planets</HI> seen from
the Sun, wou'd be directed towards the
same fixt Stars: but this too is contrary to
Observation. Likewise the Matter of the
<HI>Vortex</HI> (as of every Fluid) when bound
up within strait Bounds, must necessarily
move faster than when enlarg'd in a wider
Channel; <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Planets</HI> must move fa∣ster
in their <HI>Perihelia,</HI> than in their <HI>Aphelia,</HI>
which contradicts Experience. 5. A Body
carry'd about in a <HI>Vortex</HI> of the same den∣sity
with it, wou'd necessarily describe a
Circle to whose Plane, the Axis of the cen∣tral
Body which produces the Circulation
of the Fluid, wou'd be perpendicular; but
<PB N="37" REF="70"/>
there is not one <HI>Planet</HI> to the Plane of
whose Orbit the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Axis is perpendicu∣lar.
Lastly, The <HI>Comets</HI> have their Orbits,
not only oblique, but sometimes at right
Angles with the Plane of the Ecliptick,
sometimes the Course of these <HI>Comets</HI> is Dia∣metrically
opposite to that of the <HI>Sun;</HI> they
persevere in their Motions without any
change, they describe equal <HI>Area's</HI> by a
<HI>Radius</HI> from the <HI>Sun</HI> in equal times, they
enter into the <HI>Vortex</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> all which
is impossible, if the <HI>Solar Vortex</HI> mov'd
round with Force sufficient to carry these
vast Bodies of the <HI>Planets</HI> along with
it.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. This <HI>Hypothesis</HI> is somewhat
altered and mended by the famous Mr. <HI>Leib∣nitz,</HI>
he accomodates it better to the Cele∣stial
Appearances, and makes it agree more
exactly to the Rules of <HI>Geometry.</HI> He first
of all shows, that all Bodies which in a
Fluid describe a <HI>Curve-Line,</HI> are mov'd by
the Fluid, for of themselves they wou'd
describe right Lines, and nothing but the
Fluid concurs to turn them out of their
<PB N="38" REF="71"/>
way. He next shows, that every <HI>Planet</HI> is
carry'd about by a Motion compounded of
two other Motions, <HI>viz</HI> the <HI>Harmonical
Circulation</HI> of the carrying Fluid, and the
<HI>Paracentrical Motion</HI> of access to, or recess
from the <HI>Sun.</HI> The <HI>Planets</HI> describe <HI>Area's</HI>
by a <HI>Radius</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> proportional to
their times. Now the Fluid that carries
the <HI>Planets</HI> must of necessity circulate so
as to produce this effect, which cannot
be done otherwise, than by supposing in∣numerable
concentrical Orbs of exceeding
thinness to make up the <HI>Vortex,</HI> every one
of which has its own proper way of Cir∣culation,
<HI>viz.</HI> those Orbs that are nearest
the <HI>Sun</HI> circulate fastest, and the Veloci∣ties
of the Circulations are every where re∣ciprocally
proportional to the Distances of
the respective Orbs from the <HI>Sun,</HI> which
will necessarily make the <HI>Planet</HI> in what∣ever
part of <HI>Vortex</HI> it is, describe equal <HI>Area's</HI>
in equal Times; for these <HI>Area's</HI> are in a
compounded proportion of their <HI>Radii</HI> or
Distances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and a reciprocal
proportion of the Arches or Lengths of
<PB N="39" REF="72"/>
the Circulations, which in this case will
make a proportion of equality, and
this Law of Circulation of the <HI>Vortex</HI>
he calls <HI>Harmonical.</HI> The <HI>Paracentrical</HI>
Motion is compounded of two others, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Excussory</HI> Impression of the <HI>Harmonical</HI>
Circulation, whereby all Bodies moving
in a <HI>Curve,</HI> endeavour to recede from the
<HI>Center</HI> by the <HI>Tangent,</HI> and the Attraction
of the <HI>Sun</HI> or the Gravitation of the <HI>Pla∣net</HI>
toward it; and this <HI>Leibnitz</HI> is of Opi∣nion,
arises from an Impulse communi∣cated
by the Circulating Fluid. Now since
the <HI>Planets</HI> move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, in one
of whose <HI>foci</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> is, and by a <HI>Ra∣dius</HI>
from the <HI>Sun</HI> describe equal <HI>Area's</HI> in
equal Times, which no other Law of a
Circulating Fluid, but the <HI>Harmonical</HI> Cir∣culation
can Account for, we must find
out a Law for the <HI>Paracentrical</HI> Motion,
that may make the Orbits <HI>Elliptick.</HI> The
<HI>Excussory</HI> Impression of the Circulating
Fluid, wou'd throw off the <HI>Planet</HI> from
the Center by the <HI>Tangent.</HI> Wherefore the
Attraction of the <HI>Sun,</HI> or the Gravitation
<PB N="40" REF="73"/>
of the <HI>Planets</HI> towards it, must be suffi∣cient
to destroy this Effect; and besides,
to make them move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits,
which cannot be brought about, unless
this Attraction or Gravitation be recipro∣cally
as the Squares of the Distances from
the <HI>Focus,</HI> which is the Sum of <HI>Leibnitz</HI>'s
Doctrine upon this Head.</P>
<P>§ XXV. But even this Account of the
Celestial Motions is undoubtedly false and
insufficient for these Reasons. 1. The <HI>Co∣mets,</HI>
as was formerly said, have their
Orbits, some of them very oblique, nay,
sometimes at right Angles with the <HI>Zo∣diak,</HI>
and sometimes the Courses of these
<HI>Comets</HI> are quite contrary to that of the
<HI>Planets:</HI> Now the <HI>Comets</HI> describing about
the <HI>Sun Area's,</HI> proportional to the times,
most be carry'd about by a <HI>Harmonically</HI>
circulating Fluid, as well as the <HI>Planets,</HI>
and thus we shou'd have <HI>Vortices</HI> contrary
to <HI>Vortices,</HI> which is very absurd. 2. This
Supposition is not only unreasonable, but
disagreeable to the uniform Simplicity of
Nature; nor is there any thing in the Mo∣tions
<PB N="41" REF="74"/>
of the Heavenly Bodies so difficult
to explain, as this very <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> which
is introduc'd to account for them. Besides,
3. In equable Motion, the Times are al∣ways
as the Spaces directly, and the Ve∣locities
reciprocally; but in a Circular
Motion, the Spaces in one Revolution are
as the <HI>Radii,</HI> and in an <HI>Harmonical</HI> Circula∣tion,
the Velocities are as the <HI>Radii</HI> recipro∣cally,
and therefore the periodical Times
of a Fluid circulating <HI>Harmonically,</HI> are in
the Duplicate Proportion of the <HI>Radii.</HI>
Now the periodical Times of the <HI>Planets</HI>
are in Sesquiplicate Proportion, and not a
Duplicate Proportion of the Distances from
the <HI>Center</HI> or the <HI>Radii,</HI> and consequently
the <HI>Planets</HI> cannot be carried about by an
<HI>Harmonically</HI> circulating Fluid. To this it
may be answer'd, that this <HI>Harmonical</HI>
Circulation is not continued from <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
to <HI>Saturn,</HI> but is interrupted, and
reaches only from <HI>Mercury</HI>'s <HI>Perihelium</HI> to
his <HI>Aphelium,</HI> and there breaks off, and be∣gins
again at <HI>Venus</HI>'s <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and reaches
to her <HI>Aphelium,</HI> and is there again inter∣rupted,
<PB N="42" REF="75"/>
and so on through the whole Sy∣stem
of the <HI>Planets:</HI> But what a ghastly
and unsightly kind of Deformity there
wou'd happen on this Supposition, every one
may easily see, this is not like the unform
and simpleMeasures of Nature, Besides, the
<HI>Comets</HI> moving forward in the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> pass
through all these Chasms and Interstices,
and notwithstanding, move in the same
manner, as if they were carried by a Fluid,
circulating <HI>Harmonically</HI> according to some
uniform Law, neither do their Appearan∣ces
shew the least Suspicion of these Inter∣ruptions.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. It being thus prov'd, that
the Celestial Bodies do not revolve by the
means of any circulating Fluid, they must
be kept in their Orbits, by some <HI>Attractive</HI>
Power in the <HI>Sun,</HI> or by some gravitating
Power in them towards him, which is the
same thing, since it must be mutual by the
third Law. This Gravitating or Attract∣ing
Power of the great Bodies of the Uni∣verse
towards one another, some <HI>Philoso∣sophers</HI>
endeavour <HI>Mechanically</HI> to account
<PB N="43" REF="76"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, from the Action of a Subtile Matter,
which violently whirling round the <HI>Sun</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n general, the <HI>Earth</HI> and the rest of the
<HI>Planets</HI> in particular, and acquiring there∣by
a Power of receding from the Center,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpels Bodies towards that Center about
which the strongest Circulation is made;
or being driven with an immense Velocity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n right Lines according to all possible Di∣rections,
impels the Body according to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Direction of that part of this Subtile
Fluid, which is least resisted by the inter∣position
of other Bodies. And thus, not
only Bodies within the Sphere of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s
Activity are impell'd towards it, but also
the <HI>Planets</HI> do gravitate towards the <HI>Sun,</HI>
out without entering into the particular
manner of the Explication of Gravitation
according to this Scheme, there be two or
three Objections against all the possible Ac∣counts
of Gravity in particular, or Gravi∣tation
in general from the Circulation of a
Subtile Matter. 1. It is impossible from the
first Part of this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> to account for
Bodies gravitating towards a Point, for
<PB N="44" REF="77"/>
the Motion <HI>quaquà versum</HI> in a great Circle
of the Sphere, which is alledged to salve
this Difficulty, is a Contradiction to Nature,
no such thing being either conceiveable or
possible. 2. It is impossible to explain
whence the Circular Motion of this subtile
Fluid comes, there must be conceiv'd ano∣ther
subtile Fluid Moving after some cer∣tain
manner to produce the Motion of
of that Fluid, which is the Cause of Gra∣vity,
and so on in <HI>infinitum,</HI> or else we
must admit its Motion without any Cause,
which is harder to conceive than Gravity
it self. 3. That Matter which is the
Cause of Gravity, or by whose Motion
it is produc'd in all the possible <HI>Mechani∣cal</HI>
Explications thereof, must be without
Gravity which is Absurd Matter being
every where in reason to be suppos'd of
the same uniform Nature, and its Gravity
to be always proportional to the Quantity
of its solid Mass. 4. Bodies from the Im∣pulse
of a Fluid can only gravitate in pro∣portion
to their Surfaces, and not accor∣ding
to their Quantity of Matter, which
<PB N="45" REF="78"/>
is contraray to Experience; for we find
all Bodies gravitate in proportion to their.
Solidities, <HI>i. e.</HI> their Quantity of Matter;
And tho' this Difficulty may be remov'd,
by supposing Bodies to consist originally
of <HI>Cylinders</HI> of infinitely small <HI>Bases,</HI> for
on such a Supposition, these <HI>Cylinders</HI> wou'd
be to one another as their Surfaces, their
<HI>Bases</HI> being nothing, and consequently, the
Gravities of Bodies, which by the Action
of this subtile Fluid are as their Surfaces,
wou'd be also as their Solidities, <HI>i. e.</HI> the
Quantities of Matter they contain, since
the Surfaces of the original Particles of
Bodies are as their solid Contents. Yet
this is so very hard a <HI>Postulate,</HI> to require
Bodies to be diversified, only by the
Lengths of their primitive constituent <HI>Cy∣linders,</HI>
that I can't see how it can possibly
account for all the varieties of Colours,
Tastes and Smells, and other sensible Qua∣lities
of Bodies, which arise from the Di∣versities
of the Texture and Figure of their
constituent Parts. But that which in my
Opinion, overthrows all such <HI>Mechanical</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="79"/>
Accounts, however artfully contriv'd, is
that. 5. There seems to be necessary to∣ward
a full Explication of the Appearan∣ces
of Nature, several different Conditions
of this Universal Law of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> which
cannot be <HI>Mechanically</HI> explain'd, without
supposing different Systems of this Fluid,
to move after different Manners, and ac∣cording
to different Laws, which will nei∣ther
accord easily together, nor seem like
the Limitations and Simplicity of Nature.
That there are different Conditions of the
Universal Law of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> necessarily to
be suppos'd, seems evident from the Na∣ture
of Light, as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has explain'd
it from certain Experiment; and there are
other Appearances in Nature, that seem to
require Conditions different from that
which governs the the Motions of the Ce∣lestial
Bodies, and Causes the inflexions of
Light, as shall be afterwards shown.
Now, to account <HI>Mechanically</HI> for these
different Conditions of the General Law of
<HI>Gravitation,</HI> there must of necessity be sup∣pos'd
various and different Systems of this
<PB N="47" REF="80"/>
subtile Fluid, which looks a little odd,
especially if we consider, that is not as yet
known how many and how different these
Systems must be suppos'd to account for
all the various Conditions of this General
Law, that may hereafter be discovered ne∣cessary
to explain the various Appearan∣ces
of Nature. 6. Lastly, this whole
Affair is more Naturally and Simply to be
accounted for from Principles now to be
laid down.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary</HEAD>
<P>§ XXVII. From what has been said
it appears, that the Attraction or Gravi∣tation
of Bodies toward one another, is
not to be <HI>Mechanically</HI> accounted for, and
since it has been likewise shown, that the
<HI>Planets</HI> cannot continue their Motions in
their Orbits, without the Supposition of
such an Attraction or Gravitation, it is
evident, that this must be a Principle an∣nex'd
to Matter by the <HI>Creator</HI> of the
World; it is a Principle no ways essential
<PB N="48" REF="81"/>
to Matter, since it is the Source and the O∣rigin
of the Celestial Motions, as Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI>
and after him Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has demonstrated
And by the first Law of Nature and its Co∣rollaries,
no kind of Motion is essential to
Matter, and therefore Attraction or Gra∣vitation
cannot be essential to it; it is not
a Result from the Nature of Matter, be∣cause
the efficacy of Matter is communi∣cated
by immediate Contact, and it can
by no means act at a distance; for we see
an Object, because the Light reflected from
thence strikes immediately upon our Or∣gans
of Vision, we smell, because parts of
the odorous Body touch the Nerves of our
<HI>Nostrils,</HI> and universally all the other Na∣tural
Effects of Material things are per∣form'd
by the meer Impulse of one Body on
another, whereas this Power of Gravita∣tion
acts at all Distances without any <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
or Instrument to convey it, and pas∣ses
as far as the Limits (if any such there
are) of the Universe. Besides, by the first
Law of Nature, Matter is entirely passive
in its Nature, and can no more tend to,
<PB N="49" REF="82"/>
or draw other Bodies then it can move of
it self; likewise supposing this Gravitation
of the parts of Matter toward one ano∣ther
destroy'd, yet still Matter wou'd be
the same extended solid Substance. More∣over,
if there were but one indivisible Part
of Matter in being, it could not be said
to have this Property, it being a Relative
one, and having respect only to other
Parts which it attracts; whereas impenetra∣bility
or any other of the essential Proper∣ties
of Matter continues with it, ev'n when
it becomes indivisible. Lastly; That can∣not
be essential to Matter which is inten∣ded
or remitted, but this Property increases
and diminishes reciprocally as the Squares
of the Distances diminish or increase, where∣as
impenetrability, and the other essential
Attibutes of Matter are always the same.
On all which Accounts, it's plain that this
Universal Force of <HI>Gravitation</HI> is the ef∣fect
of the <HI>Divine Power</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> by
which the Operations of Material Agents
are preserv'd. And this Power of <HI>Gravita∣tion</HI>
being thus impress'd on Matter, is one
<PB N="50" REF="83"/>
reason of the Distinction between the Laws
of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> for tho' the <HI>Ener∣gy</HI>
of the Impression does still last, yet its
not being essential to Matter, nor arising
from its Nature, is the reason why it ought
not to be reckon'd among those Laws
which arise from the particular Texture,
Figure and Disposition of Bodies, such as
most of the Laws of Nature or Motion
are. The Chief Difficulties that I can find
have straitned Learned Men, in admitting
this Principle of the Universal Law of the
<HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bodies upon one another are,
1. That they cannot conceive how this
Principle can be <HI>Mechanically</HI> accounted for,
and they think it <HI>Unphilosophical</HI> to admit
any Principle in the Explication of the Ap∣pearances
of Nature which can't be thus ac∣acounted
for. It is indeed in my Opinion
certain, that this Priciple cannot be <HI>Me∣chanically</HI>
accounted for; for there is no o∣ther
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Cause conceivable, this
Principle of the <HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bodies upon
one another, can arise from, but the Mo∣tion
of some subtile Fluid, and were there
<PB N="51" REF="84"/>
no other Argument against all possible Ex∣plications
of <HI>Gravitation</HI> arising from the
Motion of a subtile Fluid, but this one,
<HI>viz.</HI> that thereby these Parts of Matter
which are the Cause of, or produce <HI>Gravi∣tation,</HI>
are upon this Supposition, destitute
of Gravity; I shou'd think it sufficient to
prejudice any inquisitive Man against such
Explications; for it's certain that Nature
is uniform and consistent with it self, and
wou'd not deprive one part of Matter of
so Cardinal a Property, with which she had
endow'd all the rest. But ev'n the ad∣mission
of such an <HI>Hypothesis</HI> removes us
but one Step further from <HI>Immechanical</HI> Prin∣ciples,
for the Cause of the Motion of this
subtile Fluid, which is the Cause of Gravity,
is it self <HI>Immechanical.</HI> Nor has any Body
ever pretended to assign any other Cause
of the Motion of this subtile Fluid, but the
<HI>Omnipotent Cause</HI> of the <HI>Universe;</HI> and since
we must of Necessity admit the Motion
of this subtile Fluid, which is the Cause of
<HI>Gravitation</HI> to be unaccountable without a
<HI>First Cause,</HI> why may we not rather ad∣mit
<PB N="52" REF="85"/>
this <HI>First Cause</HI> to have impress'd this
Property in Matter, since that this Difficulty
is the same in both; and that besides, the
first Supposition is burthen'd with several
Additional ones, to which the second is
not liable. There has never been any
System of <HI>Natural Philosophy</HI> offered to
the World as yet, that does not require
some <HI>Postulates</HI> that are not to be accounted
for <HI>Mechanically;</HI> the fewest any one pre∣tends
to, are the Existence of Matter, the
Impression of Rectilinear Motions, and the
preservation of the Faculties of Natural
Agents, which no Man has pretended to
account for from Principles of <HI>Mechanism;</HI>
and the Impression of an <HI>attractive Faculty</HI>
upon Matter, is no harder <HI>Postulate</HI> than
any of these; but since it is Matter of Fact
and Demonstration, that Matter is in pos∣session
of this Quality; for we daily see,
that the Earth draws to its Center all Bo∣dies
within its Activity, we must allow
of it, whether it be to be <HI>Mechanically</HI> ac∣counted
for or not; anc since it is not to
be accounted for from <HI>Mechanical</HI> Princi∣ples,
<PB N="53" REF="86"/>
as I think, I have demonstrated, we
must of necessity refer it to the Power and
Influence of the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all things.
2. Another Difficulty ingenious Men have
in the Conception of this Quality in Mat∣ter,
is how it can aft at a Distance with∣out
any <HI>Medium</HI> to convey this Action, as
of necessity it must. Now, were there
no other Difficulty of the like Nature in
Philosophy but this one, it might stumble
judicious Persons; but we know the man∣ner
of <HI>Thinking</HI> and <HI>Reflection,</HI> of <HI>Remem∣bring</HI>
and <HI>Sensation,</HI> are things not easily to
be explain'd, and yet we must admit them.
The Communication of Motion from one
part of Matter to another, the Continuation
of a Body in Motion after it is removed
from the impellent Body, and ev'n the
first Production of Matter and Motion, are
not to be accounted for, and yet there is
no denying that such things really are,
when we are capable to explain how our
Souls and our Bodies act mutually up∣on
one another, we may come to be a∣ble
to conceive how Matter acts at a Di∣stance
<PB N="54" REF="87"/>
without any <HI>Medium;</HI> but till then,
it is sufficient to know, that such a Qua∣lity
is actually lodg'd in Matter, and that
it is the Cause of all the Great and Uni∣form
Appearances of Nature. No wise
and honest Man, who throughly under∣stands
the Matter, will offer to explain by
Rules of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> how this <HI>System</HI> of
things was produc'd, nor how the Faculties
of Material Organs are preserv'd, whence
they arose, and what way they commu∣nicate
their Actions and Influences to one
another; it will suffice such, from the Pre∣sent
Appearances to investigate the Powers
and Forces of Nature, and from these to
account for future Observations and Ap∣pearances;
if we admit an <HI>infinitely Wise
and Powerful Being</HI> to have made this,
World, there will be little Difficulty in al∣lowing
him to have impress'd on Matter
what property he pleas'd, and if we
will not admit of such a Being, there are
much greater and harder Difficulties in the
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Explication of the Nature of
things to be surmounted, as shall be after∣wards
shown.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="88"/>
§ XXVIII. The great and primary
<HI>Law</HI> then, imprinted by the Author of Na∣ture
upon all the Bodies of this Universe, is
that every part of every Body attracts or
gravitates toward every part of every other
Body, and the most general Conditions of
this Law are, that the <HI>Force</HI> by which
one part attracts another in different Distan∣ces
from it, is reciprocally as the Squares of
those Distances, and that at the same Di∣stance,
the <HI>Force</HI> of the Attraction or Gra∣vitation
of one part toward divers others,
is as the Quantity of Matter they contain:
By the Virtue and Efficacy of this Law,
the <HI>Planets</HI> must perpetually move in <HI>Ellip∣tick</HI>
Orbits, if they meet with no resistance
in the Spaces in which they move, (their
Distances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and their Recti∣linear
Motions being once adjusted by the
Author of Nature,) and in such a manner,
that a Line drawn from the <HI>Sun</HI> to them,
describes equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal Times; and
their <HI>periodical</HI> Revolutions will be in a
<HI>sesquiplicate</HI> proportion of their middle Di∣stances.
By Virtue of the same Law, and
<PB N="56" REF="89"/>
of these Conditions, the <HI>Moon</HI> will for ever
turn round the Earth, as the Earth doth
round the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Sattellits</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI>
and <HI>Jupiter</HI> round them; As also the <HI>Comets</HI>
will in very oblong <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits describe
about the <HI>Sun</HI> equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal times;
But because the <HI>Sun,</HI> not only attracts the
<HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Comets,</HI> as also these the <HI>Sun,</HI> but
likewise the <HI>Planets</HI> attract one another,
their Orbits will be somewhat irregular, and
differ from exact <HI>Ellipses</HI> which will be
more sensible in the Motions of the <HI>Moon,</HI>
because She is so near to us; and this one
Consideration, well apply'd, will account
for all the Irregularities hitherto observ'd in
the Celestial Appearances, as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
and after him Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has shown; Like∣wise
since a great part of this our Globe is
covered over with Water, it is plain that
by the Force of this Attraction of the
<HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> the Water that lyes directly
under them will be rais'd above its ordi∣nary
Level, which will likewise happen if
they are directly in the opposite part of our
Globe, because the remoter parts of the Wa∣ter
<PB N="57" REF="90"/>
will be less attracted than the nearer,
and the Motions produc'd in the Waters by
the attraction of these two <HI>Luminaries</HI> can't
be observ'd seperately, but their Forces
make up a compound Motion, which at
new and full <HI>Moon</HI> is greatest, and least at
the <HI>Quadratures,</HI> and these effects are vari∣ously
limited by the different Distances of
these <HI>Luminaries</HI> from the Earth, their <HI>De∣clinations</HI>
from the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the various
<HI>Latitudes</HI> of Places. By this Gravitation,
Bodies on this Globe will press towards its
Center, tho' not exactly thither neither, by
reason of the <HI>oblate spherodical</HI> Figure of
the Earth arising from its diurnal Rotation
about its Axis. Thus we see this one Prin∣ciple
will account for all the great and con∣stant
Appearances of Nature, and none but
this will exactly answer any one, much less
them all, which is a demonstration of its
Truth. And were not our Terrestrial <HI>Phy∣siology</HI>
more complicated than the Celestial
(by reason of the multiplicity of different
Attractions proceeding from the many dif∣ferent
Bodies that surround any particular
<PB N="58" REF="91"/>
one) we should doubtless see the Extent
of this Principle, in accounting for the
more minute, and less constant appearan∣ces
on this our Globe, as in a great many
we actually are. Add to these Considera∣tions,
that we are certain by the Effects,
that the Gravitation by which the <HI>Planets</HI>
are kept in their Orbits, and by which the
<HI>Moon</HI> turns round the Earth, is of the same
Nature with that by which heavy Bodies
tend toward the Center of the Earth, and
consequently, since we feel that Terrestrial
Bodies are attracted by the Earth, and since
we know by the <HI>second Law</HI> of Nature,
that Action and Reaction are mutual and
equal, it is plain that every part of Matter
attracts every other part, and that the Force
of this <HI>Attraction</HI> (as all other Virtues pro∣pogated
round in a Sphere) is recipro∣cally
as the Squares of the Distances from
the Center of the Action. In short, since
Action and Reaction is mutual, and since
the <HI>Primary Planets</HI> gravitate towards the
<HI>Sun,</HI> as also the <HI>Secondary Planets</HI> tend to∣ward
the Primary ones as the Center of
<PB N="59" REF="92"/>
their Motions, and since the Decrease
and Increase of this Gravitation is of
the same Nature with that of our Ter∣restial
Gravity, since likewise the <HI>Sun</HI> di∣sturbs
the Motion of that <HI>Moon,</HI> and the
<HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI> those of our <HI>Earth,</HI> it is
plain they all, <HI>Sun, Moon, Planets</HI> and
their <HI>Satellits,</HI> mutually gravitate upon one
another.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Having thus in the Gene∣ral,
establish'd the Laws <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI>
and deduc'd such Consequences from 'em
as we found necessary to clear some Parts
of the following Discourses; having like∣wise
shown the Necessity of admitting the
Universal Law of <HI>Gravitation</HI> to solve the
Celestial Apperances, and hinted the great
Use of this Principle in the Celestial <HI>Phy∣siology,</HI>
let us next proceed to some of the
most <HI>Universal</HI> of our Terrestial <HI>Phaenomena;</HI>
and first of all, let us enquire into the Nature
and Cause of Fluidity, which seems to consist
principally in the <HI>Mobility</HI> of some parts, with∣out
carrying along with 'em the rest, or the
easie slipping of some Parts upon others un∣mov'd,
<PB N="60" REF="93"/>
at least, not mov'd after the manner
of solid Bodies. All the Bodies in the Uni∣verse
are Originally compounded of solid
Parts, tho' not indivisible, yet very small
and firm, and Fluids must necessarily take
in these four Conditions. 1. That their
Parts be extremely little, <HI>i. e.</HI> so very small,
that no Eye, however assisted, be able to
perceive their Magnitude, we have been
able to discover the Figures of Bodies swim∣ing
in Fluids, but no one as yet has been
able to distinguish the <HI>Figures</HI> or <HI>Magni∣tudes</HI>
of the constituent Parts of <HI>Liquors.</HI>
2. That their Figures be <HI>spherical,</HI> or at least
<HI>spheriodical</HI> or approaching to one of these,
so that they may touch only in a Point,
and by consequence, one Particle may ea∣sily
slip upon another, and for this End.
3. They must be exactly smooth and po∣lish'd,
and subjected to the Universal Law
of Gravitation, whereby each Particle of
the Fluid attracts another, whence that co∣hesion
in the Parts of the finest natural
Fluids proceeds; but their Gravity must
be such, that the Force thereof may easily
<PB N="61" REF="94"/>
exceed the Force of their Cohesion; and
here we are to distinguish between these
Fluids, generated by the Force of the Fire,
and those that are naturally such, there be∣ing
no necessity of attributing any particu∣lar
Figure to the Parts of the first Kind,
which own their Fluidity to the Force of the
Particles of Fire, which tear asunder the
Parts of solid Bodies, and keep 'em in a
perpetual Agitation, and thereby make 'em
appear in the Form of a Fluid, whereas
the Appearances of natural Fluids do ne∣cessarily
require the Conditions in their
Parts just now assign'd. 4. The Particles
of natural Fluids must be similar, of equal
<HI>Diameters,</HI> of equal Solidity, and conse∣quently
of equal specifick Gravities, that
they may be <HI>Homogeneous,</HI> and of the same
uniform Nature; from these general Sup∣positions,
all the general Appearances may
be easily accounted for.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Water seems to consist of
small, smooth, hard, porous, spherical Par∣ticles
of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> and equal speci∣fick
Gravities, which have between 'em
<PB N="62" REF="95"/>
some Spaces so large, and ranged in such
a manner, as to be pervious on all Sides.
Their Smoothness, makes 'em slip easily
upon one another, their <HI>Sphericity</HI> keeps 'em
from touching one another in more Points
than one, by both which, their Frictions
in sliding upon one another is rendered the
least possible; their Hardness is the reason
why Water is incompressible, when the
Air lodg'd in it, is exhausted.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The <HI>Porosity</HI> of the Parti∣cles
of Water (which is so great, that a
<HI>Cubical</HI> measure of Water contains at least
forty times more Pores than Parts, for Wa∣ter
is nineteen times lighter than Gold, and
consequently nineteen times rarer than
Gold; and Gold will by much pressure,
let Water pass through it, and so may be
supposed to have more Pores than solid
Parts, and by consequence, Water has
above forty times more Pores than solid
Parts) accounts not only for the different
<HI>Specifick</HI> Gravity between Water and other
Fluids, such as <HI>Mercury,</HI> but also why it
is more easily concreted into a solid Form
<PB N="63" REF="96"/>
than other Fluids are. <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Freezing,</HI>
seem to proceed from some <HI>Salin</HI> Sub∣stance
floating in the Air; we see that all
Salts, but more eminently some, mix'd
with Ice, prodigiously encrease the Effects
and Force of Cold, we see all <HI>Salin</HI> Bo∣dies
produce a Rigidity and Stiffness in
the Parts of Bodies to which they are
apply'd, much like the Effects of Free∣zing,
we know, from Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>History
of Cold,</HI> that Freezing increases the Di∣mensions
both of Solid and Fluid Bodies,
<HI>Microscopial Observations</HI> inform us, that the
Figures of some Salts, before they shoot
into Masses, are thin double wedg'd-like
Particles, which have abundance of Sur∣faces
in respect of their Solidity, which is
the reason why they swim in Water when
they are rais'd once, tho' they be specifically
heavier. But this Effect may be more justly
attributed to the same Cause that is present∣ly
to be shown to be the Cause of Freezing,
<HI>viz</HI> the small Points of the Salts getting
into the Pores of the Particles of Water,
whereby these Salts are suspended in the
<PB N="64" REF="97"/>
Water. In Summer the Heat of the Sun
dissolves the <HI>salin</HI> Particles into a Fluid,
breaks off their slender Points, and by its
Action, keeps 'em in a perpetual Motion,
so that they cannot shoot into a solid
Wedge, and consequently are not able to
produce the <HI>Appearances</HI> of <HI>Cold</HI> upon Bo∣dies;
but in Winter they are less disturb'd,
and more at liberty to approach one ano∣ther,
and by shooting into those <HI>Chrystals</HI>
(as we see the Particles of artificial Salts
do, when the Liquor is expos'd to the
the Air) which by both their Extremities
insinuating themselves into the Pores of
Particles of Water, make 'em cohere, and
fix 'em in a solid Form. The Dimensions
of freez'd Bodies are encreas'd by the In∣sinuations
of these <HI>Chrystal</HI> Wedges in their
Pores, and the Particles of congeal'd Water
are kept at some distance from one ano∣ther,
by the Figure of these <HI>Chrystals,</HI> which
in Freezing, insinuate themselves in their
Pores; for as I have before said, these
<HI>Chrystals</HI> are observ'd to have the Form of
a double Wedge, whose Extremities are
<PB N="65" REF="98"/>
pointed and slender, but its Middle broader
and larger, so that when the Extremities
have insinuated themselves into the Pores
of two watery Particles, these <HI>Globules</HI> can∣not
come to touch, by reason of the Large∣ness
of the Middle of these <HI>Chrystals,</HI> and
so these Particles in Freezing, are kept at
greater Distances from one another, than
they were when in a fluid Form, and thus
the Spaces between these spherical Parti∣cles
become larger and wider than before,
which is one Reason why Ice becomes
<HI>specifically</HI> lighter than Water. But besides
this, there are many little <HI>Volumes</HI> of Air
included at several Distances, both in the
Pores of the watery Particles, and in the
Interstices form'd by their spherical Fi∣gures.
Now by the Insinuation of these
<HI>Chrystals,</HI> the <HI>Volumes</HI> of Air are driv'n out
of the watery Particles, and many of 'em
uniting Form larger <HI>Volumes,</HI> which
thereby have a greater Force to expand
themselves than when dispersed, and so
both enlarge the Dimensions, and lessen
the <HI>specifick</HI> Gravity of Water thus con∣geal'd
<PB N="66" REF="99"/>
into Ice. Hence we may guess at
the manner, how Water impregnated with
<HI>Salts, Earths</HI> or <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> which are not
easily dissolvible, may form itself into <HI>Me∣tals,
Minerals, Gems,</HI> and other <HI>Fossils,</HI> the
Parts of these Mixtures becoming a Ce∣ment
to the Particles of Water, or getting
into their Pores, change 'em into these
different Substances.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary</HEAD>
<P>Hence it is plain, that the Quantity of
Water on this our <HI>Globe</HI> does daily decrease,
some part thereof being every Day turn'd
into <HI>Animal, Vegetable, Mineral,</HI> or <HI>Metallick</HI>
Substances, which are not easily dissolv'd
into their component Parts again; for se∣parate
a few Particles of any Fluid, and
fasten them to a solid Body, or keep 'em
asunder from one another, and they are
no more fluid, to produce which, a con∣siderable
number of these Particles are
necessarily required.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="100"/>
§ XXXII. <HI>Mercury</HI> seems to consist of
exceeding small, smooth, solid, spherical or
<HI>spheroidical</HI> Particles, for since <HI>Mercury</HI> in
ever so small Quantities is absolutely o∣pake,
and lets none of the Rays of Light
pass; and since, whatever be the Cause
of Reflexion and Refraction, Light being
Material, must either make or find a Pas∣sage
through every refracting <HI>Medium,</HI> since
likewise it is probable, that Light does
not pass through the Substance of the
constituent Particles of Fluids, but rather
through the Vacuities form'd by their Or∣bicular
Figures, it's plain, if the Particles
of <HI>Mercury</HI> be spherical, that their Diame∣ters
are not much greater than those of the
Particles of Light, for these Interstices are
as the Cubes of the Diameters of the <HI>Glo∣bules,</HI>
by whose meeting they are form'd,
and seeing Light cannot pass through these
Interstices, it is plain, that the Diameters
of the Corpuscles of <HI>Mercury</HI> must not be
much greater than those of Light; and if
these Corpuscles be <HI>Spheriodical</HI> or Oval,
their shortest Diameters must not be much
<PB N="68" REF="101"/>
greater than the Diameters of the Particles
of Light, to form Passages for it. The So∣lidity
of the Particles whereof <HI>Mercury</HI> con∣sists,
and the smalness of the Interstices they
leave between them, accounts for that won∣derful
Gravity of <HI>Mercury,</HI> above other
Fluids, and the extreme minuteness of its
Particles for the easy ascent of <HI>Mercury</HI> by
Fire, beyond all other Fluids.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. <HI>Air</HI> seems to consist of
<HI>Spires</HI> contorted into small Spheres, through
the Interstices of which, the Particles of
<HI>Light</HI> may freely pass, and this is the Rea∣son
why it is so light, the solid Substance
of the <HI>Spires</HI> being very small in propor∣tion
to the Spaces they take up, their be∣ing
spiral Accounts for the elasticity of Air;
their being spherical Particles which gives
free Passage to any Heterogeneous Matter,
Accounts for Airs being compressible,
as also how when compress'd it retains its
fluidity, because spiral Spheres, through
which another Matter freely passes, when
compress'd, form themselves into <HI>Spheriods,</HI>
or Figures most resembling them. This
<PB N="69" REF="102"/>
Account of the properties of <HI>Air,</HI> may per∣haps,
please some; But there is another
which to me seems the more genuine; for,
if <HI>Air</HI> be suppos'd to consist of small Par∣ticles,
which endeavour to recede from one
another, with a Force <HI>reciprocally proportio∣nal</HI>
to the Distances betwixt their Centers;
all the Appearances of <HI>Air</HI> may thence be
accounted for; for upon this <HI>Hypothesis</HI>
they will compose an <HI>Elastick Fluid,</HI> whose
<HI>Density</HI> is proportional to its <HI>Compression,</HI> as
Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demonstrated; <HI>Prop.</HI> 23.
<HI>Pag.</HI> 301. The <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Parti∣cles
of <HI>Air</HI> seem to be greater than those of
<HI>Water;</HI> and the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of
<HI>Water,</HI> greater then those of <HI>Mercury;</HI> and
that of the <HI>Light,</HI> by far the least of all, as
shall be afterwards shown.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. Other Fluids (besides that
of the <HI>Light,</HI> under which Name I com∣prehend
all that which passes under the
Name of <HI>Aetherial</HI> or <HI>Subtile Matter,</HI> which
I shall examin hereafter) seem to be com∣pounded,
of these <HI>Primitive Fluids</HI> viz. <HI>Wa∣ter,
Air, Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light;</HI> and of Par∣ticles
<PB N="70" REF="103"/>
of <HI>Salts, Earths, Sulphurs,</HI> and such
like Ingredients, and the Varieties of such
mixt Fluids may in the general be thus esti∣mated.
1. Supposing all other things a∣like,
especially the <HI>Primitive Fluid,</HI> and the
Figure of the parts of the Ingredient, the
mixt Fluids will differ proportionably to the
Magnitude of the parts of the solid Body,
which mixes with the Fluid; thus Water
or <HI>Lymph</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Flesh or
Blood of a greater <HI>Diameter,</HI> will make a
different Liquor from the same <HI>Lymph,</HI>
mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Flesh or Blood of a
less <HI>Diameter.</HI> 2. <HI>Caeteris Paribus,</HI> (especi∣ally
the Fluid, the Figure, and the Dia∣meters
of the mixing Ingredient being the
same,) the Liquor will differ proportiona∣bly
to the Difference of the Firmness or
Softness of the Parts of the mixing Ingre∣dient;
thus <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI>
of <HI>Diamond,</HI> would make a different Fluid
from <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Sil∣ver
or Brass. 3. All other things being
suppos'd the same, the Fluid will differ pro∣portionably
to the Difference of the spe∣cifick
<PB N="71" REF="104"/>
Gravities of the Particles of the
mixing Ingredients; thus a mixture of <HI>Gold</HI>
and <HI>Mercury</HI> will make a different Liquor
from that of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> the Diffe∣rence
of the specifick Gravities being here
only considered. 4. All other things
being suppos'd the same, the Liquor will
differ according to the different Degrees of
the Cohesion of the solid Parts among
themselves; thus, <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with little
spherical <HI>Magnets,</HI> will make a different
mixture from that of <HI>Mercury,</HI> mixt with
little Spheres of <HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Iron.</HI> And these
seem to be the <HI>Primogenial</HI> Differences of
mixt Fluids; Now, not only all these
may be differently combin'd with one ano∣ther,
and with the four <HI>Primitive Fluids,</HI>
but also the Figures of the solid Parts in
the mixture may be infinitely diversified,
(whereas we have hitherto only suppos'd all
the mixing Solids <HI>spherical</HI>) which will
make an infinitely infinite Variety of mixt
Liquors.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="105"/>
§ XXXV. That <HI>Light</HI> is a Body, or a
material Substance, seems to be evident
from these Considerations. 1. It is pro∣gressive,
and requires a determin'd time to
go from one place to another, and is not
propagated in an Instant, as is plain from
Mr. <HI>Romer</HI>'s Reasonings upon the <HI>Eclipses</HI>
of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> (which are con∣firm'd
by the Observations of other <HI>Astro∣nomers</HI>)
whereby he demonstrates that <HI>Light</HI>
requires about ten Minutes to come from
the <HI>Sun</HI> to us. 2. It may be stopt or re∣sisted
in its Passage from one place to ano∣ther,
by the Interposition of an opake Body,
as other Fluids are stopt in their Courses
by the Opposition of any solid Body.
3. It may be congregated within a nar∣rower,
or scattered through a larger Space,
as is evident from reflecting <HI>Specula,</HI> and
refracting <HI>Burning-Glasses.</HI> 4. It may be
reflected, and the Determination of its Mo∣tion
changed like other Bodies, and it ob∣serves
the same Law in its Reflexions that
other Bodies do, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Angle</HI> of Refle∣xion
is always equal to the <HI>Angle</HI> of Inci∣dence
<PB N="73" REF="106"/>
5. It may be put out of its Course
more or less, according to the Nature of
the <HI>Medium,</HI> through which it passes. 6. It
acts upon the <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI> and upon
all other Bodies, as other fluid Substances
do, by striking upon them with a deter∣min'd
Force, by communicating a certain
Degree of Motion to them, by separating
their component Parts, and putting them
in Motion; all these Effects we daily see.
7. It may be confin'd and shut up in de∣termin'd
Spaces like other Fluids. The
The Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> will warm and heat
other solid and fluid Bodies, which effects,
continue when their Cause is remov'd; the
parts of Light are yearly imprison'd in Fruits,
Plants, and other Vegetables, as we see by
the Spirits, and warm Juices they afford.
8. Lastly, the parts of Light are endow'd
with various <HI>Original Colours,</HI> some are <HI>Red,</HI>
others <HI>Blue,</HI> others <HI>Yellow,</HI> and some <HI>Green,</HI>
as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demonstrated, and may
be seen by a <HI>Prism</HI> applied to the Hole of a
darken'd Room through which the <HI>Sun</HI>
shines. Now all these are the Properties of
<PB N="74" REF="107"/>
Bodies and can belong to nothing but Mat∣terial
Substances.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. That the Particles of <HI>Light</HI>
are extremely little or small, we may con∣clude
from thence, that they pass through
almost all Bodies that are pervious, such as
<HI>Chrystals, Glasses,</HI> several <HI>Gems,</HI> and almost
all Fluids but <HI>Mercury,</HI> and that it freely
passes where no other Fluid, how thin soe∣ver,
can enter, and yet, no eye, however
assisted, has been able to discover or distin∣guish
the parts of the grossest Fluid. But
what most of all demonstrates their smal∣ness,
is that Light may be propagated from
innumerable different <HI>Luminous Bodies,</HI> with∣out
any considerable opposition to one ano∣ther;
Suppose a Plate of Mettal (having
at the top the smallest Hole can be made)
were erected <HI>perpendicularly</HI> upon a <HI>Horizon∣tal
Plane,</HI> and about it were set innumera∣ble
luminous Objects of about the same
height with the Plate, at an ordinary Di∣stance
from it, the Light proceeding from
every one of those Objects, will be propaga∣ted
through this small Hole, without interfe∣ring
<PB N="75" REF="108"/>
This will appear by applying a dark
Object, in a straight Line against the Lu∣minous
Body, for the Light of this Body
will through the Hole be receiv'd upon the
dark Body; Now it is impossible that so
many different <HI>Streams of Light</HI> cou'd be
transmitted through so small a Hole, were
not the Particles of Light extremely small.
Add to this, that were not the Particles of
Light extremely little, being extremely
swift, (<HI>i. e.</HI> more than a Million of times
swifter than a <HI>Cannon Bullet,</HI> continuing in
its greatest Velocity, as shall be presently
shown) they wou'd peirce all kinds of so∣lid
Bodies with almost as great Facility as
they do Vacuities, whereas we see Light
regularly reflected from some Bodies.
Moreover, we find that innumerable dif∣ferent
Spheres of Light within our <HI>Hori∣zon,</HI>
may be propagated from their several
luminous Centers, without interfering. How
many Millions of Candles and <HI>Flambeaux</HI>
may we see sending out their <HI>Tides</HI> of
Light, without clashing upon one ano∣ther,
which argues both the Smallness of
<PB N="76" REF="109"/>
the Parts of Light, and the Largeness of
the void Interstices between the Particles of
Air and other Bodies.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. How extremely swift the
Particles of <HI>Light</HI> are, we may gather from
the forementioned Experiment of Mr. <HI>Ro∣mer</HI>'s
whereby he demonstrates, that the
<HI>Streams of Light</HI> pass from the <HI>Sun</HI> to our <HI>Earth</HI>
in about ten Minutes; and <HI>Hugens</HI> in his <HI>Cos∣motheoros,</HI>
has prov'd, that a <HI>Bullet</HI> conti∣nuing
in the Velocity with which it leaves
the Musle of the <HI>Cannon,</HI> wou'd require
twenty five Years to pass from us to the <HI>Sun;</HI>
Now the <HI>Via Percursa</HI> being the same in
both, the Velocities will be reciprocally as
the times, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Velocity of Light will
be to that of a <HI>Cannon-Bullet,</HI> persisting in
its greatest swiftness, as twenty five Years is
to ten Minutes, or as 1314700 to one <HI>Pro∣xime,</HI>
so that the Velocity, with which the
Particles of Light pass, will be more than
a Million of times swifter than a <HI>Cannon-Bullet.</HI>
Moreover, the Distance betwixt
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>us</HI> is at Least 12000 <HI>Diameters</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="110"/>
of the Earth, but allowing it to be only
10000 <HI>Diameters,</HI> the Light runs a thousand
<HI>Diameters</HI> in a Minute, or sixteen and half
Diameters of the Earth in a Second, or
beating of an Artery, that is more than
1100000 <HI>Toises,</HI> since the <HI>Diameter</HI> of the
Earth contains 2865 <HI>French Leagues,</HI> and
every <HI>League</HI> contains 2282 <HI>Toises,</HI> accor∣ding
to the Numbers of Mr. <HI>Picard.</HI> But
Sound goes but about 180 <HI>Toises</HI> in a Se∣cond,
wherefore Light is about six hundred
thousand times more Swift than Sound.
Likewise since the Earth's middle <HI>Diameter</HI>
is 7846 Miles, each of which contains
5000 Feet; and since Light goes in a Se∣cond
or in a pulse of an Artery, sixteen and
a half; <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Earth, it is plain,
that in every Second it runs at least a hun∣dred
and thirty thousand Miles, which is
a prodigious and almost an incredible Space
in so short a time. But the extraordinary
Effects of Light and Heat seem to require
all this; we see how powerfully it acts
(being congregated) upon the most com∣pact
solid Bodies, and we never perceive
<PB N="78" REF="111"/>
any diminution of its Force arising from
an abatement of its Velocity.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The <HI>Sun</HI> and fixt <HI>Stars</HI>
seem to be huge, dense Bodies (like the
<HI>Earth</HI> or <HI>Planets</HI>) heated to an extraordi∣nary
Degree, and their Heat probably may
be preserv'd by the greatness of their Bo∣dies,
and the mutual Action and Re action
between their Parts and the Light, which
they emit, and their Parts are kept from
suming away by their <HI>fixity,</HI> and also by
vast Weight and Density of the <HI>Atmos∣pheres</HI>
incumbent upon them, and power∣fully
compressing them, and condensing
the Vapours and Exhalations which arise
from them: The Light seems to be emit∣ted
from them by the vibrating Motion of
their Parts, after the manner we see Iron,
when heated to such a Degree, as to be
just going into Fusion, by the vibrating
Motion of its Parts, send forth with Force
and Violence, copious Streams of liquid
Fire all around; Great Bodies preserve their
Heat longest, and that perhaps in propor∣tion
to their <HI>Diameters.</HI> Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has
<PB N="79" REF="112"/>
made it probable, that the <HI>Comet</HI> which ap∣pear'd
in 1680. by approaching to the <HI>Sun</HI>
in its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> acquir'd such a Degree of
Heat, as to be 50000 Years a cooling,
whence we may guess, that suppo∣sing
the <HI>Sun</HI> and fixt <HI>Stars</HI> to be only
<HI>Collections</HI> of dense and solid Matter like
the <HI>Planets,</HI> heated to a very intense De∣gree,
they may be many Millions of Years
without losing any considerable part of
their Heat. <HI>Astronomers</HI> have observ'd a
close, compact and large <HI>Atmosphere</HI> about
the <HI>Sun,</HI> and there is no doubt to be made,
that its Body is of the same Nature with
the other material Parts of this Universe,
excepting what Alterations its vehement
Heat may produce, and consequent∣ly,
its highly probable, that the <HI>Sun</HI> and
<HI>fixt Stars</HI> are only <HI>Planets,</HI> vehemently
heated.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> act mu∣tually
upon one another, <HI>i. e. Bodies</HI> act
upon <HI>Light,</HI> in emitting reflecting, refract∣ing
and bending its Rays, and <HI>Light</HI> upon
<HI>Bodies,</HI> in heating them, and putting their
<PB N="80" REF="113"/>
Parts in a vibrating Motion, wherein Heat
consists, according to Mr. <HI>Newton's</HI> Disco∣veries.
If we suppose that <HI>Bodies</HI> act upon
<HI>Light,</HI> by attracting it in Lines <HI>perpendi∣cular</HI>
to their Surfaces, <HI>i. e.</HI> supposing two
similar <HI>Mediums</HI> distinguished by <HI>Parallel</HI>
Lines, and that a Ray in its Passage out
of the one through the other, is urged <HI>per∣pendicularly</HI>
towards either Plane, by any
Force, which at given Distances from the
Plane, is of given Quantities; then what∣ever
Inclinations the Rays have to the Plane
of <HI>Incidence,</HI> the Sign of the <HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Inci∣dence</HI>
of every Ray considered apart, shall
have to the Sign of the <HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Refraction</HI>
a constant <HI>ratio;</HI> this Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has de∣monstrated,
both in his <HI>Principia,</HI> pag. 227.
<HI>&amp; seq.</HI> and in his <HI>Opticks,</HI> pag. 57. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI>
and it the Velocity of the Ray be greater
before its <HI>Incidence</HI> than afterwards it shall
be reflected, and the <HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Incidence</HI> shall
always be equal to the <HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Reflexion;</HI>
and since it is Matter of Experiment and
Observation, that the Signs of the <HI>Angles</HI>
of <HI>Incidence</HI> and <HI>Refraction</HI> in all Rays of
<PB N="81" REF="114"/>
whatever Nature, observe a constant <HI>ratio,</HI>
and that the <HI>Angles</HI> of <HI>Reflexion</HI> and <HI>Inci∣dence</HI>
are equal; it is therefore on the o∣ther
hand true, that the Rays of <HI>Light</HI> are
thus urg'd by the <HI>Refracting Media,</HI> and
their Velocity thus abated by <HI>reflecting</HI>
ones, so that it is evident, <HI>Refraction</HI> and
<HI>Reflection</HI> proceed from one and the same
Princiciple, acting differently in different
Circumstances.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon∣strated
from plain and convincing Experi∣ments,
that the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> consists of
Rays differently <HI>refrangible</HI> and <HI>reflexible,</HI> and
that those Rays are differently <HI>reflexible,</HI> that
are differently <HI>refrangible.</HI> These Rays
that are all alike <HI>refrangible,</HI> he calls the <HI>Light</HI>
of them Simple and <HI>Homogeneal,</HI> and those
that are some more <HI>refrangible</HI> than others,
he calls their <HI>Light,</HI> Compound and <HI>Heteroge∣neal;</HI>
the greater or less <HI>Refrangibility</HI> of
Rays, is their Disposition to be turn'd more
or less out of their way, in like Incidences
on the same <HI>Medium;</HI> and their greater or
less <HI>Reflexibility</HI> is their Disposition to be re∣turn'd
<PB N="82" REF="115"/>
back more or less easily into the
same <HI>Medium</HI> from any other, upon whose
Surface they fall. <HI>Refraction</HI> out of the
Rarer <HI>Medium</HI> into the Denser is made so,
that the <HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Refraction</HI> is less than the
<HI>Angle</HI> of <HI>Incidence,</HI> and on the contrary. The
Colours of <HI>Homogeneal Light</HI> are these, <HI>Vio∣let,
Indico, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange</HI> and
<HI>Red.</HI> These Colours in the Objects are
their Disposition to <HI>reflect</HI> this or that sort
of Rays more copiously than the rest; and
in the Rays of <HI>Light</HI> they are their Dispo∣sition
to propagate this or that Motion into
the <HI>Organs</HI> of Vision, and in <HI>them,</HI> they are
Sensations of those Motions under the Forms
of Colours; the Rays that produce Red
Colours, are least <HI>refrangible,</HI> and those
that make Violet, the most, and the rest
are more or less <HI>refrangible,</HI> as they ap∣proach
either of these Extremes in the Or∣der
set down, that is, Orange is least <HI>re∣frangible,</HI>
next to Red, and Yellow next
to Orange, and so on. All the Colours
of the Universe which are made by Light,
are either the Colours of <HI>Homogeneal</HI> Lights,
<PB N="83" REF="116"/>
or compounded of a Mixture of those;
Whiteness is produc'd by a due Mixture
of all the <HI>Primary</HI> Colours of <HI>Homogeneal</HI>
Light; and Blackness by a Suffocation,
or <HI>Non-reflexibility</HI> of Light; and all Grey
Colours, betwixt Black and White, may
be compounded of all the <HI>Primary</HI> Co∣lours
mixt in a due Proportion; the <HI>Pri∣mary</HI>
Colours of <HI>Homogeneal</HI> Light are un∣changeable
in their Nature, and no <HI>Re∣flexions</HI>
nor <HI>Refractions</HI> will change any of
these into another; whereas by the due
Mixture of colour'd Bodies, Colours may
be produc'd by Composition, which shall
be like to the Colours of <HI>Homogeneal</HI> Light,
but not as to the immutability of Colour;
for that may be chang'd according to the
Colour of the Light by which they are
seen; so that if the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Light consisted
but of one sort of Rays, there wou'd be
but one Colour in the whole World, and
it wou'd be impossible to produce any new
Colour by <HI>Reflexions</HI> or <HI>Refractions,</HI> for all
the Variety of Colours depends upon the
Composition of Light.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="117"/>
§ XL. The Rays of Light which fall
upon Bodies and are <HI>reflected</HI> or <HI>refracted,</HI>
begin to bend before they arrive at the Bo∣dies.
Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has shown by several
Experiments of Rays passing by the Edges
of Bodies, that they are <HI>incurvated</HI> by the
Action these of Bodies as they pass by them,
and that this Action is strongest at the least
Distance; he has demonstrated likewise,
that the Cause of <HI>Reflexion</HI> is not the im∣pinging
of Light on the solid and impervi∣ous
Parts of Bodies. For (not to repeat those
other Arguments which he has brought in
great plenty) since Glass can be no other
ways polish'd than by grating and scratch∣ing
it by Substances, whose Parts are
small and subtile, so that the Scratches and
Frettings of its Surface become too small
to be visible, yet not so small as to be∣come
truly plain or <HI>spherical,</HI> and all toge∣ther
to compose one Surface; if Light
were <HI>reflected</HI> by impinging upon the solid
Parts of Glass; it wou'd be scatter'd as
much by the most polish'd Glass, as by
the roughest, which being contrary to Ex∣perience,
<PB N="85" REF="118"/>
it is evident that the Reflexion
of a Ray is not effected by one single Point
of the <HI>reflecting</HI> Body, but by some Power
of the Body, which is evenly diffus'd
over all its Surface, by which it acts upon
the Ray without immediate <HI>Contact,</HI> after
the manner hinted § 37. Bodies <HI>reflect</HI>
and <HI>refract</HI> Light by one and the same
Power variously exercised in various Cir∣cumstances;
for when Light goes out of
Glass into Air as <HI>obliquely</HI> as it can possibly
do, if its <HI>Incidence</HI> then be made still more
<HI>oblique,</HI> it becomes totally <HI>reflected,</HI> for then
its <HI>refractive</HI> Power, or the Force of its
Attraction upon the Ray, becomes too
strong to let any of the Rays go through.
Besides that, those Surfaces of transparent
Bodies which have the greatest <HI>refracting</HI>
Power, <HI>reflect</HI> the greatest Quantity of
Light; for by Experiment it is found, that
in the <HI>Superficies</HI> interceding two transpa∣rent
<HI>Mediums,</HI> the <HI>Reflexion</HI> is stronger or
weaker, as the Superfice hath a greater or
lesser <HI>refracting</HI> Power, for in the confine
of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Sal-Gem</HI> 'tis stronger than in the
<PB N="86" REF="119"/>
confine of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> and still stronger
in the confine of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>common Glass</HI> or
<HI>Crystal,</HI> and stronger in the confine of <HI>Air</HI>
and <HI>Diamond.</HI> Between the Parts of opake
and colour'd Bodies, there are many Spa∣ces
either empty or replenish'd with <HI>Me∣diums</HI>
of other Densities, as Water between
the tinging Particles wherewith any Li∣quor
is impregnated, Air between the <HI>aque∣ous
Globules,</HI> that constitute Clouds or Mists,
and perhaps, <HI>Mediums</HI> different from both
these between the Parts of hard Bodies.
Now <HI>Reflexions</HI> are produc'd in the <HI>Su∣perficies</HI>
which intercede these <HI>Mediums</HI> of
different Densities, and the Reason why
uniform, pellucid <HI>Mediums</HI> have no sensible
Reflexion, but at their external <HI>Superficies,</HI>
is because all their Parts are of an equal
Density; and Opacity arises from the mul∣titude
of <HI>Reflections</HI> produc'd in the internal
Parts of Bodies.</P>
<P>§ XLI. All Bodies seem to have their
<HI>refractive</HI> Powers <HI>proportional</HI> to their Den∣sities,
excepting so far as they partake more
or less of sulphurous, oily Particles, and
<PB N="87" REF="120"/>
thereby have their refractive Power made
more or less; this Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has found
by Observation on almost all transparent
Bodies, together with a Calculation founded
upon the Supposition, that Light is swifter
in Bodies than <HI>in vacuo,</HI> in the Proportion
of the <HI>Signs</HI> which measure the <HI>Refraction</HI> of
Bodies, which is certainly true, since it's
from the Action of Bodies on Light, that
this <HI>refractive</HI> Power does arise; and it's
very probable, that this <HI>refractive</HI> Power
in Bodies does mostly depend upon the
sulphurous Parts with which they abound,
since all Bodies partake more or less of Sul∣phurs,
as by Chymical <HI>Analyses</HI> we find.
And as Light congregated by a Burning-Glass,
acts most upon sulphurous Bodies,
to turn them into Fire and Flame; so since
all Action is mutual, Sulphurs act most
upon Light: and that the Action between
Light and Bodies is mutual, is evident from
this Consideration, that the densest Bodies
which <HI>refract</HI> and <HI>reflect</HI> Light most strong∣ly,
grow hottest in the Summer Heat, by
the Action of the <HI>refracted</HI> and <HI>reflected</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="121"/>
Light. The Bodies that reflect Light, are
those whose Pores are fill'd with <HI>Mediums</HI>
of an unequal Density with that of the <HI>re∣fracting
Medium</HI> itself, and Bodies become
more transparent, by filling their Pores
with Fluids of equal, or almost equal Den∣sities
with their Parts, as Paper dip'd in
Water or Oyl; and on the contrary, the
most transparent Substances may by eva∣cuating
their Pores, or separating their Parts,
be rendered sufficiently opake, as Salts or
wet Paper dried, Glass by being pulve∣ris'd,
or Horn by being scrap'd.</P>
<P>XLII. The <HI>least Parts</HI> of almost all
Natural Bodies are transparent, as may
be seen by viewing small Bodies with a
<HI>Microscope,</HI> and consequently, they must
according to their several Sizes, reflect Rays
of one Colour, and transmit those of a∣nother,
upon the same Ground that thin
Plates reflect or transmit those Rays; for
a thin Plate of an even thickness appears
all over of the same Colour, and if this
Plate were slit into <HI>Threads,</HI> or broken
into <HI>Fragments</HI> of the same thickness with
<PB N="89" REF="122"/>
the Plate, there is no Reason why every
<HI>Thread</HI> or <HI>Fragment</HI> should not keep its Co∣lour,
and consequently, why a heap of
those <HI>Threads</HI> or <HI>Fragments</HI> should not con∣stitute
a Mass or Powder of the same Co∣lour
which the Plate exhibited before it
was broken; and the small Parts of all Na∣tural
Bodies being like so many <HI>Fragments</HI>
of a Plate, must on the same Grounds ex∣hibit
their Colours. Now Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
found by Observation, that thin Plates or
Bubbles <HI>reflected</HI> Rays of one Colour and
<HI>trasmitted</HI> those of another, according to
their several thickness or thinness; and there∣fore
the small Parts of Natural Bodies be∣ing
transparent, must upon the same
Grounds <HI>reflect</HI> or <HI>transmit</HI> the several sorts
of Rays: and this is the Foundation of the
various Colours of all Natural Bodies. But
the parts of Bodies on which their Colours
depend, must be denser than the <HI>Medium,</HI>
which pervades their Interstices; and as
there is a constant Relation between Co∣lours
and <HI>Refrangibility,</HI> the most <HI>Refran∣gible</HI>
Rays being <HI>Violet,</HI> the least <HI>refrangible
<PB N="90" REF="123"/>
Red,</HI> and those of intermediate Colours ha∣ving
proportionally intermediate Degrees
of <HI>Refrangibility;</HI> so there is a constant Re∣lation
between Colour and <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> the
<HI>Violet</HI> being in like Circumstances reflected,
at least thicknesses of any Plate or Bubble,
the Red at greatest thicknesses, and the inter∣mediate
Colours at intermediate thicknesses;
and there are several Orders of those Co∣lours
more or less intense and vivid, ac∣cording
to the several thicknesses of these
Plates or Bubbles: and the Reason why the
Surfaces of all thick and transparent Bo∣dies
reflect part of the Light incident on
them, and refract or transmit the rest, is,
that some Rays at their <HI>Incidence</HI> are in <HI>Fits</HI>
of easie <HI>Reflection,</HI> and others in <HI>Fits</HI> of
easie <HI>Transmission.</HI> Those whose who de∣sire
full Satisfaction in this wonderful Ap∣pearance
of Nature, must go to that late
admirable Treatise of <HI>Opticks,</HI> written by
Mr. <HI>Newton;</HI> for it is impossible to separate
the Parts of this Work from one another
without Disadvantage to them,, or to sum
them up in a less room, without losing some∣thing
<PB N="91" REF="124"/>
<HI>New</HI> and <HI>Useful.</HI> That great Person
having before shown how far <HI>Numbers</HI> and
<HI>Geometry</HI> would go in. <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI>
has now manifested to the World to what
surprizing Heights, even vulgar <HI>Experi∣ments</HI>
duly managed and carefully examin∣ed
in such Hands may advance it. In the
general, I think we may safely conclude
from Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s Discoveries, 1. That
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are but <HI>Planets</HI> or
<HI>Earths</HI> vehemently heated, or having their
smallest Parts put in a strong <HI>vibrating</HI> Mo∣tion.
2. That Light is emitted from them,
by these powerful <HI>Vibrations</HI> of their small∣est
Parts. 3. That this Fluid of Light e∣mitted
from these <HI>vibrating</HI> luminous Bo∣dies
requires a certain time in passing from
them to us, and moves after the same man∣ner
other Fluids do, only with a much
greater Velocity. 4. That Bodies draw
this Light to 'em in Lines <HI>perpendicular</HI> to
their Surfaces, and that this Light puts the
parts of these Bodies in a <HI>vibrating</HI> Mo∣tion
wherein Heats consist. 5. That the
Motion of Light is swifter in Bodies than
<PB N="92" REF="125"/>
<HI>in vacuo,</HI> by reason of this Attraction, and
and slower after its being <HI>reflected,</HI> than in
its <HI>Incidence,</HI> because that Force of Attra∣ction
which accelerates its Motion in its
<HI>Incidence,</HI> must of Necessity retard its Mo∣tion
in its <HI>Reflexion,</HI> by reason of the diffe∣rent
Direction thereof. 6. That the Ray
in its whole Course of <HI>Reflexion</HI> and <HI>In∣cidence</HI>
describes a <HI>Curve,</HI> or is rather bend∣ed
than broken. 7. That the <HI>Vibration</HI>
of the smaller Parts of Bodies produc'd
by the Action of Light, when brought
to a certain Degree of Strength, is the
Cause of their Light, just as we see the
<HI>Vibrations</HI> produc'd in the Air by tremu∣lous
and sonorous Bodies, must be of
such a determin'd Force to produce a di∣stinct
Sound. 8. That these <HI>Vibrations</HI>
produc'd in Bodies by the Action of
Light, when their Motion conspires with
that of the Rays of Light, <HI>i. e.</HI> when
any Ray is in that part of these <HI>Vibrations</HI>
that has the same Direction with that of
the Ray, it easily breaks through a <HI>re∣fracting</HI>
Substance, but when it is in the
<PB N="93" REF="126"/>
contrary part of the <HI>Vibration,</HI> which im∣pedes
its Motion, it is easily reflected, and
so every Ray is dispos'd <HI>alternately</HI> to be
easily <HI>reflected</HI> or easily <HI>transmitted.</HI> 9. That
the Rays of Light are of their own Na∣ture
diversly <HI>Refrangible</HI> and <HI>Reflexible,</HI> and
that this diversity in both arises from the
same Principle, acting differently in dif∣ferent
Circumstances, <HI>viz.</HI> the Action of
Bodies upon Light. 10. That <HI>Reflexion</HI>
is caus'd by the different Densities of Bo∣dies,
and happens only in <HI>Superficies</HI> that
intercede <HI>Mediums</HI> of different Densities.
11. That Light is totally transmitted
through <HI>Mediums</HI> only that are of the same
uniform Density, and that the <HI>refractive</HI>
Power of Bodies is principally owing to
the Sulphurs with which they abound;
for since all Action is mutual, and since
Light congregated by a Burning-Glass acts
most upon Sulphurs, so Sulphurs ought to
act most upon Light. 12. That the For∣ces
of Bodies to <HI>reflect</HI> or <HI>refract</HI> Light
are very nearly proportional to the Den∣sities
of the same Bodies. 13. That cer∣tain
<PB N="94" REF="127"/>
Colours are ty'd to such Degrees of
<HI>Refrangibility</HI> or <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> and that all
the <HI>primitive</HI> and <HI>original</HI> Colours depend
upon these Degrees. 14. That <HI>White</HI> con∣sists
in an equal Mixture of all the <HI>primi∣tive</HI>
Colours, and <HI>Black</HI> in a Suffocation
of all the Rays of Light, which is the
Reason why <HI>Blacks</HI> burn more easily
than other Colours; and other not <HI>primi∣tive</HI>
Colours arise from a certain Mixture
of these. 15. That the Colours of Na∣tural
Bodies depend upon the different
Density of their small Parts, and thereby
their fitness to reflect Light of one Co∣lour
and transmit that of others. 16. That
several sorts of Rays make <HI>Vibrations</HI> of seve∣ral
bignesses, which according to their big∣nesses
excite Sensations of several Colours
much after the same manner, that the <HI>Vibra∣tions</HI>
of the Air according to their several big∣nesses
excite Sensations of several Sounds.
17. That the <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Discord</HI> of Co∣lours
arise from the Proportions of the <HI>Vi∣bration</HI>
propagated through the Fibres of the
Optick Nerves into the Brain, as the <HI>Har∣mony</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="128"/>
and <HI>Discord</HI> of Sounds arises from the
Proportions of the <HI>Vibrations</HI> of the Air.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been said of the Nature
of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and its <HI>Light,</HI> it is evident that
the Quantity of Heat and Light in the <HI>Sun</HI>
does daily decrease; like other vehemently
hot Bodies it must gradually cool; as also,
by its <HI>Emission</HI> of so many Millions of Rays
perpetually, quite round its Body upon all
the <HI>Planets</HI> within its System, which do not
return, both its Bulk and Heat must be di∣minished.
It is not improbable that all the
virtual Heat in the juices of Vegetables,
Metals and Minerals, may be owing to the
imprisoned Rays in 'em; the Production of
Animals in the ordinary way, require sa cer∣tain
Degree of Warmth, which proceeds
from his Influence. SomeBodies do stifle and
suffocate the Rays of Light, so as that they
are never, or not duly reflected again. Sul∣phurous
Bodies form little Cells by the
Action of the Rays of Heat and Light to
<PB N="96" REF="129"/>
retain 'em, and from the Ingenious Expe∣riment
of the <HI>accurate</HI> and <HI>learn'd</HI> Mr. <HI>John
Bernoulli,</HI> we are inform'd, that our <HI>Atmo∣sphere</HI>
and all the Bodies on our Globe are
<HI>saturated</HI> at all times with Rays of Light
which never return again to their Fountain,
because as has been shown in the former Se∣ctions,
Bodies do attract, and consequently
retain these Rays. I shall here set down
one of the Ways (for he try'd the same Ex∣periment
after different manners) the Inge∣nious
Author prescribes, which by my Or∣der
was repeated here at <HI>London.</HI> They are
related in the 2d. Volume of Mr. <HI>Fontanelle</HI>'s
<HI>Memoirs of the Academie Royalle for the Year</HI>
1700. We suck'd thro' a very clean Tube
of about 30 Inches in Length, open at
both ends, very well cleansed <HI>Mercury,</HI> till
it came to the top, then nimbly striking off
the upper Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> which had
been soil'd by the Air, and hindred the
Effect in former Tryals, we nicely and
quickly clos'd the upper end with a proper
Cement so that no Air cou'd get in, then su∣spending
the Tube that the <HI>Mercury</HI> might
<PB N="97" REF="130"/>
subside, and darkening the Room that no
Light could get in, we perceiv'd that at,
every <HI>Vibration,</HI> Flashes of Light appear'd in
the Vacuity at the upper End, which en∣lighten'd
all the Room, which as Mr. <HI>Ber∣noulli</HI>
reasons, happen'd thus; that Film of
Dirt, wherewith the Air soils the upper
Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> and which hinders
the Passage of the Particles of Light in or∣dinary
<HI>Barometers,</HI> being remov'd; in the
<HI>Vibrations</HI> of the Tube, the <HI>Mercury</HI> ascend∣ing
in its oblique Situation, subsides again
in its <HI>Perpendicular</HI> one, and thereby leaves
behind it a Vacuity, to fill which, the Par∣ticles
of <HI>Light,</HI> being the only Body that
can get in, rushes in, from the <HI>Mercury</HI>
and through the Glass, in great Quantities,
and so produces these Flashes; which shows
that the Substance of <HI>Light,</HI> is scattered
every where, though it be not visible.
Now since it's certain, that Bodies do attract,
the Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> and do retain 'em so,
that they can never return to the Fountain
of <HI>Light</HI> again; it's plain, the Quantity
of <HI>Light</HI> both in this <HI>Bright Luminary,</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="131"/>
and in the <HI>Sun-like fixt Stars</HI> must be
continually decreasing: However, it's also
certain, that this Decrease is very inconsi∣derable
in any short time, though we are
sure there is some, and our not being sen∣sible
of this Decrease, is only an Argu∣ment
of the exceeding Smalness of the
Particles of <HI>Light.</HI> We find some <HI>odorife∣rous</HI>
Bodies, send out Steams for many
Years, without sensibly diminishing either
their Bulk or Weight, which argues the
Smalness of the Parts of these Steams. But
the Particles of <HI>Light</HI> must be extremely
small, since the <HI>Sun</HI> for so many Ages has
been constantly emitting <HI>Oceans</HI> of Rays,
without any sensible Diminution: But this
can surprise no Body, who considers that
Matter is infinitely divisible; for it is pos∣sible
to assign in Numbers, a Quantity,
whereof a Body as big as the <HI>Sun</HI> may
constantly, for any finite Number of Years
emit <HI>Oceans,</HI> and yet the Sum of 'em all,
may not be greater than a cubical Inch,
or even a Grain of Sand.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="132"/>
§ XLIII. We have already observ'd,
that the most general Condition, of the
<HI>Universal Law</HI> of Gravitation in Bodies, was,
that at the same Distance from the Center
of the attracting Force, Bodies did gravi∣tate
in proportion to their Solidity, and at
different Distances, <HI>reciprocally</HI> as the Squares
of those Distances; but this Condition is
not so general, as altogether to exclude
others; the way to know how this <HI>Uni∣versal
Law</HI> is diversify'd, in the different
Bodies, is to observe what Lines, Bodies
in their Motions or Actions upon one ano∣ther
describe, or what the Effects of these
Motions and Actions are; and then to in∣vestigate
what Conditions of the <HI>Univer∣sal
Law</HI> of Gravitation, will make Bodies
describe these Lines, or produce these Ef∣fects.
Thus if any of the <HI>Primary</HI> or <HI>Se∣condary
Planets,</HI> did describe perfect Circles
or <HI>Ellipses</HI> about the <HI>Sun,</HI> or a <HI>Primary
Planet</HI> plac'd in the Center, the Condi∣tion
of the <HI>Universal Law</HI> in these, would
be, that the <HI>attractive Force</HI> at different Di∣stances
from the Center, would be as these
<PB N="100" REF="133"/>
Distances directly. If they described a
<HI>Parabola,</HI> by supposing the <HI>attractive Force</HI>
at an infinite Distance, or an <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> by
changing the <HI>Centripetal</HI> into a <HI>Centrifugal
Force;</HI> then the Condition of the <HI>Universal
Law</HI> wou'd be, that the Force were al∣ways
<HI>equable</HI> and the same at all Distances,
as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demonstrated, <HI>Prop.</HI> 11.
<HI>Lib. I.</HI> We find, as has been insinuated in
the preceding Sections, That the Rays of
<HI>Light</HI> in passing through different <HI>Media,</HI>
do tend <HI>perpendicularly,</HI> to either the Plane
of <HI>Incidence</HI> or <HI>Reflexion,</HI> so that the Force
of Attraction is always the same, at equal
Distances from the same Plane. We see
that the Parts of <HI>Air,</HI> shun or fly from one
another, instead of tending to one another;
so that in accounting for the Appearances
of Nature from the <HI>Universal Law</HI> of Gra∣vitation,
we are not ty'd to one single Con∣dition,
but may have recourse to others as
the Nature and Necessity, of the Appearan∣ces
seem to require; for the whole Diffi∣culty
of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> seems to lie in investi∣gating
the Powers and Forces of Nature,
<PB N="101" REF="134"/>
from the Appearances of the Motions given,
and then from these Powers to account for
all the rest.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The obvious Appearances of
<HI>cohering</HI> Bodies are thus, two very smooth
well polish'd, plain Bodies, put together,
will firmly cohere even in an exhausted
Receiver, which shows evidently that their
<HI>Cohesion</HI> is owing, neither to the Gravity, nor
to any other Property of the Air; all sa∣line,
crystalline, and most mineral Bodies,
break in very smooth and plain, or at least
<HI>congruent</HI> Surfaces; and universally almost
all hard and very compact Bodies, break
with Surfaces, which immediately upon
the Separation, appear whitish, which is
an Evidence, that though the Surfaces be
very small, yet they are very smooth and
polish'd, for only innumerable little po∣lish'd
Surfaces, are fit to reflect plentifully
all kinds of Rays, whereby white Co∣lours
are produc'd. Now these Appearan∣ces
of <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies, do naturally lead us
to imagine, that one necessary Condition
toward <HI>Cohesion,</HI> is the plainness, or at least
<PB N="102" REF="135"/>
<HI>Congruity</HI> of <HI>cohering</HI> Surfaces, and this
seems necessary to exclude any Fluid from
lying between <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies, for these
Bodies cannot be said to <HI>cohere,</HI> or be con∣tinued,
betwixt whose <HI>cohering</HI> Surfaces, in
all its Points a Fluid may insinuate itself.
The plainness and smoothness of the <HI>cohe∣ring</HI>
Surfaces, will make more Points come
into <HI>Contact,</HI> than when they are rough
and irregular. For whatever Cause <HI>Cohe∣sion</HI>
arises from, if we suppose that Cause
to act most strongly at the <HI>Contact,</HI> the
more Points of the <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies come
into <HI>Contact,</HI> the firmer the <HI>Cohesion</HI> will
be; and though exact Congruity in <HI>Curve</HI>
Surfaces, will bring as many Points into
<HI>Contact,</HI> as plain Surfaces will, yet <HI>Curvity</HI>
not being the simplest, nor most expedi∣tious
Method of producing this Effect, nei∣ther
agreeable to Nature, (who always
brings about all her Effects the shortest
and easiest way) it seems evident, that
the plainness and smoothness of Surfaces, is
one Condition of <HI>Cohesion,</HI> and that those
<HI>Atoms</HI> that are terminated with plain Sur∣faces
<PB N="103" REF="136"/>
will (<HI>caeteris paribus</HI>) produce Bodies
of the firmest <HI>Cohesion.</HI> This will appear
more evident from the contrary Quality in
the constituent Particles of Fluids. For we
have shown before, that one necessary
Condition of <HI>Fluidity,</HI> is the <HI>Curvity</HI> of the
Surfaces, of the constituent Particles of
Fluids, whereby their <HI>Cohesion</HI> is very small,
in respect of the <HI>Cohesion</HI> of those Particles
that are terminated with plain Surfaces, and
their Gravity always exceeds the Force of
their <HI>Cohesion,</HI> so that from both these
Causes, they easily slip and move one upon
another. We may then suppose that some
of the <HI>Primary Atoms,</HI> of which Bodies are
constituted, are terminated with plain Sur∣faces
on all sides, which will produce Bo∣dies
of the firmest <HI>Cohesion,</HI> others again are in∣tirely
terminated with <HI>curve</HI> Surfaces, which
will produce Fluids, and between those in∣tirely
plain, and entirely <HI>curve,</HI> there are
infinite <HI>Combinations,</HI> of plain and <HI>curve</HI> Sur∣faces
<PB N="104" REF="137"/>
which will account for all the vari∣ous
Degrees of <HI>Cohesion</HI> in Bodies, in respect
of their Figures. But though this smooth∣ness
and plainness, in the Surfaces of <HI>cohering</HI>
Bodies, will bring most Points into <HI>Contact,</HI>
yet this will not hinder them from being
separated, by any Force how small soever;
and since we are certain, that <HI>cohering</HI> Bo∣dies
require a determin'd Force, to separate
them, there wants still a <HI>Cement,</HI> as it were,
to hinder them from being easily separated
when join'd. Now this can be deriv'd
from nothing in Nature, but that <HI>Univer∣sal
Law</HI> of Attraction, whereby all the
Parts of Matter, endeavour to <HI>embrace</HI> one
another, and cannot be separated but by
a Force superiour, to that by which they
attract one another; let us then enquire
what Condition of the <HI>Universal Law,</HI> will
most fitly answer the Appearances of <HI>Co∣hesion.</HI></P>
<P>§ XLV. On the Center <HI>A,</HI> and at the
Distance <HI>AD,</HI> let a Circle be described, to
whose Plane at <HI>A,</HI> let <HI>P A</HI> be <HI>perpendicular,</HI>
and <HI>P</HI> be a <HI>Particle</HI> of Matter, attracted

Condition of the <HI>Universal Law,</HI> from <HI>P</HI>

attracts the Body <HI>P,</HI> and let <HI>LKI</HI> be the

circumstantiated Generats; Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has
demonstrated, <HI>Pag.</HI> 218. <HI>Prop.</HI> 90. <HI>Lib.</HI> I.
<PB N="106" REF="139"/>
<HI>Princip. Phil. Mathemat.</HI> that the Force
whereby the whole Circle, upon the <HI>Radius
AD,</HI> attracts the Corpuscle <HI>P,</HI> is as the
<HI>AHIL</HI> multiplied upon the Distance <HI>AP,</HI>
let <HI>P F</HI> be call'd <HI>x,</HI> and <HI>FK, y;</HI> and let
<HI>FK,</HI> or the Force whereby the Point <HI>E</HI>
attracts the Body <HI>P,</HI> be reciprocally as any
Power (suppose <HI>n</HI>) of <HI>P F</HI> then the <HI>Equa∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>Curve</HI> will be, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
whose <HI>Area O P F K M</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>

<HI>x</HI> you substitute <HI>PH,</HI> then you have
<HI>OPHILM</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and therefore
putting <HI>m. = n−1,</HI> we shall have, <HI>AHIL</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<PB N="107" REF="140"/>
and consequently the
<HI>Attraction</HI> of the Circle upon the <HI>Cor∣puscle</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
If <HI>n</HI> = 1. and <HI>PA</HI> = 0, then the <HI>Radius</HI>
of the attracting Circle being produc'd,
will coincide with the <HI>Asymptote P O,</HI> in
which Case, (the <HI>Curve</HI> being the vulgar
<HI>Hyperbola,</HI>) the <HI>Area AHIL</HI> will be in∣finite,
and <HI>P A</HI> being nothing, or the Di∣stance
between the <HI>Corpuscle</HI> and the <HI>at∣tracting

P A × AHIL</HI> = 0 × ∞ = 1.
If <HI>n</HI> = 1 and <HI>P A</HI> = ∞ <HI>i. e.</HI> when the
<HI>attracting Plane AD,</HI> is plac'd at the <HI>Con∣course</HI>
of the <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> with its <HI>Asymptote

<PB N="108" REF="141"/>
is <HI>P,</HI> and whose <HI>Radius</HI> is <HI>PD</HI> = <HI>PA</HI>

<HI>AL</HI> and <HI>HI</HI> will coincide, and
therefore <HI>PA</HI> × <HI>AHIL</HI> = ∞ × 0 = 1.</P>
<P>If <HI>n = i</HI> and <HI>PA= a,</HI> let <HI>AH</HI> be
called <HI>y,</HI> then <HI>PH = x = a + y.</HI> And

<P>If <HI>n</HI> = 2. and <HI>PA</HI> = 0, then the <HI>Area
AH<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>L</HI> will be <HI>more than Infinite</HI> (the
meaning of which Expression shall be after∣wards
explain'd) and therefore the Attra∣ction
will be <HI>PA × AHIL</HI> = 0 multi∣ply'd
into more than Infinite; from whence
it appears that the Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI>
in this Case, when <HI>PA</HI> = 0, is greater
than that in the former Case, where <HI>n</HI> = 1.
and <HI>PA</HI> = 0.</P>
<P>If <HI>n</HI> = 2 and <HI>PA</HI> = ∞, there the
<HI>Area AHIL</HI> will be nothing, and con∣sequently
the <HI>Attraction</HI> = <HI>PA × AHIL</HI>
= ∞ × 0 = 1. And hence it appears that
<PB N="109" REF="142"/>
in this Case, if <HI>PA</HI> = 0, the <HI>Attraction</HI> will
be greater than when <HI>PA</HI> = ∞. for of
two Products, having the same Multipli∣cator,
that is the greater, which has the
greater Multiplicand, so that if <HI>A</HI> denote

when <HI>PA</HI> = ∞, I say, that <HI>A</HI> is
to <HI>a,</HI> as a greater than infinite is to infi∣nite,
contrary to what happen'd in the
first Case, where <HI>n = i,</HI> for the <HI>Attraction</HI>
in that Case was the same both when <HI>PA</HI>
was equal to 0 and to ∞, <HI>viz</HI> 1.</P>
<P>If <HI>n</HI> = 2 and <HI>PA = a,</HI> then as former∣ly

<P>If <HI>m</HI> = 3 and <HI>PA</HI> = 0, then <HI>AHIL</HI>
will be more than infinite, but <HI>AHIL</HI> in
this third Case will be greater than <HI>AHIL</HI>
in the second Case, and consequently the
Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI> when <HI>PA</HI> = 0 in
both Cases, will be greater in this Case
than in the second Case, for the reason
now mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> because <HI>PA</HI> = 0 is
<PB N="110" REF="143"/>
a common Multiplicator in both, and
AHIL in this Case, is greater than
AHIL in the second.</P>
<P>If <HI>m</HI> = 3 and PA = ∞, then as be∣fore,
AHIL will be equal to nothing,
and consequently the <HI>Attraction</HI> will be
∞ × 0 = 1.</P>
<P>If <HI>m</HI> = 3 and PA = <HI>a,</HI> then the <HI>At∣traction</HI>
will be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this
manner, the Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI> of the
<HI>circular Plane</HI> upon the <HI>Corpuscle</HI> P, may
be easily computed in any assignable case
of the <HI>Powers</HI> of the Distance PF. and at
any assignable Distance of the <HI>Corpuscle</HI>
from the Plane.</P>
<P>From these <HI>Calculations</HI> it is evident, that
the Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI> of the Plane up∣on
the <HI>Corpuscle,</HI> when the Distance is no∣thing,
or when the Plane and the <HI>Cor∣puscle</HI>
come into <HI>Contact,</HI> increases when
the <HI>Powers</HI> of the Distance <HI>n</HI> increase;
<PB N="111" REF="144"/>
thus when <HI>n</HI> = 2. and PA = 0, the Force
of the <HI>Attraction</HI> is greater, than when <HI>n</HI> = 1
and PA = 0, and so in others higher.
As also, it's clear from these <HI>Calculations,</HI>
that the Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI> of the Plane
upon the <HI>Corpuscle,</HI> at the same finite Distan∣ces
decreases faster, or at a greater rate,
when the <HI>Powers</HI> of the Distances are high,
than when they are lower, or when <HI>n</HI> is a
greater Number, than when is less;
thus at the same finite Distances, the
Force of the <HI>Attraction</HI> is much less <HI>propor∣tionally,</HI>
when <HI>n</HI> = 3, than when n= 1,
or 2, and so in others where the Difference
between <HI>n</HI> in one Case and in the other, is
yet greater.</P>
<P>Now to apply this to the <HI>Cohesion</HI> of Bo∣dies:
It's certain that the first Condition (<HI>viz.</HI>
when the <HI>Attraction</HI> is reciprocally as the
Distance between the <HI>attracting</HI> Bodies,)
cannot obtain in the <HI>Cohesion</HI> of Bodies; for
the Difference between the Force, when the
Bodies are in <HI>Contact,</HI> and when they are at
some Distance from one another, in this case,
is so small, as does not answer the <HI>Appear∣ances;</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="145"/>
for we find, that the Force whereby
Bodies <HI>cohere,</HI> is very much greater, when
they come to immediate <HI>Contact,</HI> and than when
they are at ever so small a finite Distance
from one another.</P>
<P>In the second Condition of the <HI>Universal
Law</HI> of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> when the Force is <HI>re∣ciprocally</HI>
as the <HI>Squares</HI> of the Distance,) the
Difference of the Force of <HI>Cohesion,</HI> between
Bodies at immediate <HI>Contact,</HI> of the same,
at some Distance from one another, is greater
than in the former Case; But not sufficient
to account for this Difference observable in
the manner of the <HI>Cohesion</HI> of Bodies. But
if it were possible to gather by <HI>Experiment,</HI>
the <HI>proportion</HI> of the decrease of this Force, in
<HI>cohering</HI> Bodies, to the same, at some deter∣min'd
Distances from one another, that
would give the Condition of the <HI>Universal
Law.</HI> But it will be very difficult to make
any such <HI>Experiments,</HI> because the Fluids
which surround Bodies, upon the Surface of
our <HI>Globe,</HI> get in between the Surfaces of Bo∣dies
when they are at any Distance, greater
than the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the constituent Parti∣cles
<PB N="113" REF="146"/>
of these Fluids, and so by their lateral
pressures, destroy the efficacy of the Force
whereby Bodies <HI>cohere;</HI> thus the Particles of
<HI>Light,</HI> and of <HI>Air,</HI> get in between the Sur∣faces
of Bodies, remov'd at almost an insen∣sible
Distance from one another, and seeing
<HI>Light</HI> and Bodies act mutually upon one a∣nother,
and that the Particles of <HI>Air,</HI> endea∣vour
to recede from one another, they render
the efficacy of the Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> where∣by
Bodies <HI>cohere,</HI> altogether insensible at any
Distances from one another, greater than are
the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of these Fluids;
and a Distance equal to the <HI>Diameters</HI> of such
subtil Fluids, is too small to be distinguish'd
by our Senses, howsoever assisted. How∣ever
this be, it is very evident, that all the
Appearances of the manner of the <HI>Cohesion</HI>
of Bodies, may be explain'd from this <HI>Prin∣ciple
of Gravitation,</HI> together with that other
already mentioned, of the plainness of the
Surfaces of <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies; for if all Bodies
<HI>cohere</HI> after one and the same manner, then
one Condition of this <HI>Universal Law of Gra∣vitation</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="147"/>
will serve; if some Bodies attract
one another after one manner, others after
another (and these Diversities to some may
seem not improbable, to account for the
different Degrees of Firmness, Solidity and
<HI>Cohesion</HI> observable in Bodies) then, there
is sufficient variety in this <HI>Universal Law</HI> to
account for all these Diversities; so that it's
evident that from these Principles, <HI>Cohesion</HI>
in all possible Cases may be explain'd.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. <HI>Cohesion</HI> in general being thus
explain'd, it is no hard matter to understand
<HI>Elasticity,</HI> which seems to arise from the
same <HI>Principles,</HI> of smooth and plain Sur∣faces,
and of some one or more of the men∣tion'd
Conditions of the <HI>General Law of At∣traction.</HI>
In bending <HI>elastick</HI> Bodies, we
find the <HI>Convex</HI> side exceedingly stretch'd,
in so much, that by frequent and long con∣tinued
Bendings, there become visible <HI>Fis∣sures,</HI>
in the out-side, which no doubt were
there before, or in the first Bendings, tho'
not so large, as to be visible, as also we see
<PB N="115" REF="148"/>
the <HI>Concave</HI> side, mightily contracted, or its
Parts forcibly press'd together, so as to run
into Folds or lesser <HI>Convexities,</HI> on the in-side:
the same thing happens, when two <HI>elastick</HI>
Globes, or Balls, strike against one ano∣ther,
only the <HI>Convex</HI> sides, are turn'd in
towards their <HI>Centers;</HI> the matter being thus,
let us suppose, that two very smooth and
plain square Surfaces, are join'd together,
so that each Particle in these Planes, attracts
another, by some one or other of the Con∣ditions
of the <HI>General Law of Attraction,</HI> if
these Planes, by any external Force, were so
separated, as to move upon a common side
of the Congruent squares as an <HI>Axis,</HI> and that
no forein Fluid endow'd with a disjoining
Force (such as <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> are) cou'd in∣terpose,
to hinder their Action: it is cer∣tain▪
that the external Force which thus se∣parated
these Planes, ceasing to act, the <HI>At∣tractive</HI>
Force wou'd immediately bring
these Planes together again, and if these
Planes were separated by a <HI>parallel</HI> Motion,
if the Distance were so small, that no forein
<PB N="116" REF="149"/>
Fluid could get in to hinder their Action,
if the <HI>separating</HI> Force ceas'd, the <HI>attracting</HI>
Force would act and bring 'em together a∣gain;
and in both Cases, with a Force
which may be easily gathered from the
Condition of the Law of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and
the Distance of these Planes being given.
Now all <HI>Elastick</HI> Bodies in their Actions
upon one another, changing their Figures,
must of necessity have some of their Parts
in these Actions, separated by a <HI>parallel</HI> or
a circular Motion about an <HI>Axis;</HI> or by a
Motion after some manner compounded of
both these, (for it is no matter after what
manner they are disjoin'd, provided they be
not separated, so far, as to admit any forein
Fluid to enter, which may destroy the effi∣cacy
of the Force, whereby these Particles
<HI>attract</HI> one another.) If we then suppose,
the Surfaces of the Parts of <HI>Elastick</HI> Bodies,
plain and smooth, and that they <HI>attract</HI> one
another after some one or other Condition
of the <HI>Universal Law;</HI> being separated by a
forein Force, they must (when that Force cea∣ses)
<PB N="117" REF="150"/>
join together again with a certain degree
of Force, (which is to be estimated from the
Distance, and Condition of the <HI>Universal
Law</HI> being given,) and so will produce all
the <HI>Appearances</HI> of <HI>Elastick</HI> Bodies. Upon
the same <HI>Principles,</HI> may the <HI>Elasticity</HI> of <HI>Ten∣dinous</HI>
Bodies, be explain'd, but it is not my
Business here, to descend into all the par∣ticular
Circumstances. If <HI>Elastick</HI> Bodies ob∣serv'd
one constant <HI>Proportion,</HI> in their un∣bending,
toward their bending Forces, it
were easie from thence, to determin the
Condition of the <HI>Universal Law</HI> by which
their Particles attract one another; but per∣haps
some may think, there are as great
Varieties in this as in <HI>Cohesion,</HI> I shall not
therefore trouble the Reader, in this place
with the particular Consequences, from
particular Conditions of the <HI>General Law</HI> of
<HI>Attraction,</HI> but shall content my self to have
laid down the only <HI>Principles</HI> upon which
these intricate, and hitherto <HI>despair'd of Ap∣pearances,</HI>
may be accounted for.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="151"/>
I would proceed to the rest of the <HI>Appea∣rances</HI>
of Nature which I am satisfy'd can be
accounted for, from the same <HI>Principles,</HI>
but that these already explain'd are most of
what I shall make use of in the following
Treatise, for which this <HI>Chapter</HI> was design'd
only as a <HI>Lemma:</HI> Besides that, some of the
rest will naturally come into the Subject

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origination of this World,
and of Mankind in particular.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. IT is a little surprising to see Men
sometimes contending and wran∣gling
about the <HI>Origin</HI> of their
several Families, and yet scarce any Bo∣dy
give Himself the trouble once seri∣ously
to consider or enquire how Man at
first became to <HI>be,</HI> whether he sprang from
the <HI>Earth</HI> or dropt from the <HI>Clouds,</HI>
when he began, or if ever there was a
<PB N="2" REF="153"/>
time when he was not; tho' these Enqui∣ries
be far more worthy a wise Man's pains
than those insignificant Contests. We are
easily satisfy'd we and our own immedi∣ate
Parents have not been for ever; but
few of us go farther, we take this World
as we find it, without troubling our Heads
<HI>who made it,</HI> or whether it was <HI>made</HI> or
not. No Body can well bear to have
their <HI>Ancestors</HI> affronted, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their <HI>Pedi∣gree</HI>
despised; and yet very many now a
days don't scruple. to own themselves
the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> or the Off∣spring
of <HI>blind Fate and Chance.</HI> Whate∣ver
others may do, I shall not think my
Pains ill bestow'd once in my Life to have
examin'd how this present state of things
became at first to <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>§ II. There are three general Opini∣ons
about this matter, the first is of those
of the Epicurean Sect, that holds that an
<HI>immense Void,</HI> and an Infinity of different∣ly
figur'd, very small, extreamly; hard and
infrangible <HI>Particles of Matter</HI> have for
<HI>ever been;</HI> and that these Particles mo∣ving
<PB N="3" REF="154"/>
of 'emselves in a direction oblique
to one another, after innumerable <HI>ren∣counters,</HI>
did at last settle in this <HI>beautiful
Order of things</HI> we now behold. This is
the <HI>Scheme</HI> upon which some build their
<HI>Hopes,</HI> and upon the account of which
some of our <HI>Moderns</HI> think 'emselves sub∣til
<HI>Philosophers,</HI> how justly we shall now
examine.</P>
<P>§ III. First this <HI>Scheme</HI> supposes Mat∣ter
to have forever been of itself, with∣out
any Cause; which is a very liberal
Compliment to such an unactive inani∣mate
Mass, to make it independent for
its Being and uncapable of being destroy∣ed
(both which <HI>Self-existence</HI> necessarily
implies) 'tis to raise it to a very high pitch
of Dignity, to which we find none of its
other qualities answerable. <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Space</HI>
it's true may have for ever been; but that
is because they may have some relation
to a Being endow'd with all other suitable
qualities; but Matter seems to be too igno∣ble
a Being to arrogate such high <HI>Endom∣ments.</HI>
But pass we over this Head, as
<PB N="4" REF="155"/>
not essential to the Business in Hand.
And,</P>
<P>§ IV. Let us consider how out of
these few <HI>Principles</HI> of an <HI>immense Void,</HI>
an infinity of very small, hard, and in∣frangible
<HI>Particles,</HI> and their <HI>oblique Dire∣ction</HI>
to one another, it is possible to form
this present state of things. We have
have prov'd § XI. of the preceding Chap∣ter,
that <HI>Motion</HI> is no more <HI>essential</HI> to
Matter than Rest, that of it self it can
never bring it self into Motion, that it
wou'd for ever continue in the state it is
put in, and, if it was from all Eternity
at rest, it would continue so for ever;
if in Motion, it wou'd for ever move on.
But I'd gladly know whence this motion
did proceed, since it is suppos'd there is
nothing beside unactive Matter it self to
produce it. Whatever can be suppos'd to
put Matter in Motion, may at the same
time, and with the same ease, be suppo∣sed
to have directed the several parts
thereof to the Places they are now in, <HI>i. e.</HI>
to have produc'd this <HI>present state of things.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="156"/>
No Body can think Motion <HI>essential</HI> to
Matter, who sees any part thereof at rest;
for what is <HI>essential</HI> to any thing, that
thing can never be without it. But some
<HI>Philosophers,</HI> and those of great Name too,
have asserted that no part of Matter ever
was nor can be at absolute rest. For, say
they, Motion is a Quantity, and may be
divided <HI>in infinitum</HI> as well as other Quan∣tities,
and a Body may be moving any fi∣nite
time, and yet never sensibly change
its <HI>relative</HI> Place; for the space is as the
Velocity, and if the Velocity be very
small, the space it moves through is so
likewise: And that those Bodies which
seem to be at rest, are only alternately
moving very slowly to and from the <HI>ter∣mination</HI>
of the Motion, or the <HI>Obstacle.</HI>
To this I answer, that tho' it may be ve∣ry
true, that nothing, in this Universe is
actually at <HI>absolute rest,</HI> but that every thing
is in some degree of Motion; yet that ab∣solute
Rest in Bodies is not impossible, is
clear from hence, that it implies no con∣tradiction,
a Sphere in a vacuity shou'd
<PB N="6" REF="157"/>
be press'd by two other equal Spheres with
equal Forces and contrary Directions; from
which pressure the intermediate Sphere
wou'd be at <HI>absolute Rest;</HI> wherefore if it
is not absurd a Body shou'd be at <HI>absolute
Rest,</HI> it is impossible Motion shou'd be
<HI>essential</HI> to Matter. There is another Argu∣ment
which to me seems very conclusive
against Motions being <HI>essential</HI> to Matter,
and that is from the infinite possible Varie∣ties
of its Directions; laying aside the con∣sideration
of all other Bodies; or, suppo∣sing
a Body moving <HI>in vacuo,</HI> it must move
in one certain <HI>Direction.</HI> Now what is it
that determines it to this <HI>Direction</HI> rather
than to any other of the infinite Variety;
no Reason can possibly be assign'd why it
shou'd move rather in this than in any
other of the infinite number of Directions.
And it cannot possibly move in more than
one of 'em at once, and therefore it will
of itself move in none of 'em, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will
not of it self move at all, and consequent∣ly
Motion is not <HI>essential</HI> to Matter. For
in the faculties of natural things which are
<PB N="7" REF="158"/>
not endow'd with Free-will, where there
is an infinite variety of Choice, and no
possible Reason to determine any one way,
there can be no Choice made at all. From
all which it is plain, that allowing the
<HI>Abe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tors</HI> of this <HI>Philosophy</HI> their <HI>Void</HI> and
their <HI>Atoms,</HI> yet nothing cou'd be produc'd
for want of Motion, it not being <HI>essential</HI>
to Matter, as has been prov'd, and there
being nothing else to produce it.</P>
<P>§ V. But allowing Matter to be <HI>self-existent</HI>
and <HI>self-moving,</HI> I wou'd know
whence came this <HI>obliquity</HI> of <HI>Direction,</HI>
this is to ascribe Will and Choice to these
Particles, and to alledge that they are ca∣pable
of resolving what way they will go.
The Contrivers of this <HI>Scheme</HI> saw wisely
enough, that granting these <HI>Atoms</HI> to be
<HI>self-moving,</HI> yet nothing wou'd follow but
an eternal wandering in Lines <HI>parallel</HI> to
one another, without any other effect;
and therefore they added, that these Parti∣cles
moved with different <HI>oblique Di∣rections</HI>
to one another; by which means
they wou'd meet and justle and reflect, in
<PB N="8" REF="159"/>
innumerable different ways. But does not
every Body see that it is as easie and as
intelligible to suppose this World already
in Being, as to suppose these Particles
endow'd with this <HI>obliquely</HI> directed Mo∣tion,
the Cause of the one being no less
accountable from their Principles than the
other. We see all Motions now perform'd
in the same direction with that, of the mo∣ving
Force, and all Motions produc'd by
the same <HI>adequat Cause</HI> have the same <HI>Di∣rections;</HI>
and consequently, if the Mo∣tion
of these Atoms arises from 'emselves,
they must all follow the same <HI>Directions,
i. e.</HI> they must all move in <HI>parallel</HI> Lines;
and consequently they cou'd never meet
in order to produce any regular Effect.
We do not find that Matter or Bodies
now can alter their Directions, and yet
according to the Opinion of these Men
for infinite Ages by-past, they have mov'd
as they listed. Why do they not so still?
Since (according to their own supposition)
nothing has happen'd to alter their Na∣ture,
or the manner of their Motions ever
<PB N="9" REF="160"/>
since; it is altogether unaccountable
why Matter shou'd move in one <HI>Direction</HI>
rather than another, upon any other ac∣count
but the <HI>Direction</HI> of the impress'd
Force, and all that's alleged on this Head
by the <HI>Favourers</HI> of this <HI>Scheme</HI> is altoge∣ther
<HI>precarious.</HI></P>
<P>§ VI. But allowing these <HI>Atoms</HI> to be
<HI>self-existent, self-moving,</HI> and <HI>obliquely</HI> di∣rected,
yet 'tis still inconceivable how they
shou'd produce a World. For these <HI>Atoms</HI>
cou'd not move all with the same degree
of Obliquity to one another, for that
wou'd be making 'em all <HI>converge</HI> to a
point, and so nothing but one great so∣lid
Sphere cou'd be produc'd; if they hap∣pen'd
to unite after their Meeting, and if
they again reflected from one another,
they wou'd produce a fluid Sphere, their
rectilinear Motions turning into circular
ones, or otherwise wander on in right
Lines as before: And to make some con∣verge
to one point, others to another; is
to say these Atoms were intelligent free
Beings, which cou'd chuse the course they
<PB N="10" REF="161"/>
wou'd go in. We have a very powerful
Proof of the insufficiency of these, <HI>Atoms,</HI>
tho' endow'd with their <HI>obliquity</HI> of <HI>Dire∣ction</HI>
to produce any thing, in the Rays
of the Sun, which as was before prov'd
are very small parts of Matter, by the inter∣position
of the surfaces of reflecting Bodies
differently situated, obtaining all possible
varieties of Obliquity; and yet these pro∣duce
no regular <HI>Systems</HI> of Bodies, tho'
they move and probably justle and inter∣fere
all imaginable ways. As I have just
now said, only those whose <HI>Directions</HI>
converge to a point, cou'd meet to pro∣duce
any real Body, and ev'n the Body
which wou'd be produc'd wou'd only be
a <HI>spherical</HI> one. So that out of all their
Motions, only <HI>Spheres</HI> of different Mag∣nitudes
cou'd be form'd, which how small
a part this is of the infinite variety of
Bodies in this Universe, I leave the Rea∣der
to confider. The truth of the mat∣ter
is, if Bodies were <HI>self-moving,</HI> they
cou'd move what way they pleas'd, and
stop when and where they pleas'd, <HI>i. e.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="162"/>
they wou'd be free-will'd <HI>Elective</HI> Agents.</P>
<P>§ VII. Again, allowing these <HI>Atoms</HI>
to be <HI>self-existent, self-moving</HI> and <HI>obliquely</HI>
directed, yet I wou'd gladly know how
from thence this <HI>Ʋniverse</HI> cou'd be fram'd.
It is not enough to say barely these <HI>Atoms</HI>
thus dispos'd wou'd at last settle into this
state of things, unless it be shewn by what
particular <HI>Motions, Directions</HI> and <HI>Refle∣ctions,</HI>
the principal Bodies of this Uni∣verse
were fram'd. To shew a thing pos∣sible
to be done, we must tell how, what
way, and by what Laws it may be done.
For unless we descend to Particulars, we
are never certain it can be so; and 'tis as
probable (till the contrary be evinc'd, in
some Particulars at least) it may not be
so. <HI>Generals</HI> are always to be suspected,
a Contradiction may be discovered in the
particular Explications of an Appearance
that was not taken notice of in the <HI>general
Scheme;</HI> as indeed it happens in every
individual Instance of this present Subject
hitherto attempted. I shall not ask of
those who defend this <HI>Scheme,</HI> a particu∣lar
<PB N="12" REF="163"/>
account of the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of every in∣dividual
Appearance in our <HI>Systeme,</HI> for
that indeed were endless. But if any one
can tell by what Laws of Mechanism, any
one Animal or Vegetable was produc'd,
or from what mechanick Principles the
Planets describe <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, I shall
for the sake of these allow their whole
<HI>Scheme</HI> to be true. We all know how
wretchedly <HI>Des Cartes</HI> (the ablest <HI>Patron</HI>
that ever this Opinion had) has blunder'd
on these Heads, and his Followers have
not mended the matter much. It is sur∣prising
to think how any reasonable Man
cou'd believe this <HI>Ʋniverse</HI> to have been
produc'd by Matter and Motion; when
as yet no Man that ever liv'd, from these
Principles alone, can tell by what <HI>Mecha∣nism</HI>
the most contemptible of the <HI>Celestial</HI>
or <HI>Terrestrial</HI> Bodies cou'd be produc'd;
and yet to be fully satisfy'd of the truth
of this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> a Man must understand
the particular Mechanism of the whole
<HI>System</HI> of things, and of every individual
Appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="164"/>
§ VII. These <HI>Atoms</HI> are supposed <HI>in∣frangible,</HI>
extreamly compacted and hard
(as indeed the least parts of Matter must
necessarily be) which <HI>compactedness</HI> and
<HI>hardness</HI> is a demonstration that nothing
cou'd be produc'd by 'em, since being so
they cou'd never come to cohere, in or∣der
to produce solid Bodies. The only
tolerable account of <HI>Cohesion</HI> in such like
Particles is from their branch'd Figure.
Now hard solid Particles reflecting from
one another, can never possibly lay hold
of one another, at least not so but that
the least Motion will disjoin 'em again.
It is impossible to conceive how innumera∣ble
hard and compacted <HI>Atoms</HI> swimming in
an immense <HI>Abyss</HI> cou'd ever come to co∣here
so as to produce such hard Bodies
as <HI>Diamonds</HI> and some other <HI>Mineral Sub∣stances</HI>
are, without any other cement but
their catching hold of one another; this
mutual embracing might keep 'em from
being easily torn assunder, but they wou'd
be still movable like chain'd Work, and
cou'd never produce the appearance of
<PB N="14" REF="165"/>
Firmness and Solidity. And what is here
said of Cohesion and Solidity, may be like∣wise
shewn of Elasticity. And thus allow∣ing
these <HI>Atoms</HI> to be <HI>Self-existent, Self-moving,
obliquely</HI> directed, and to meet
according to any Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> yet
they cou'd only produce loose heaps of
<HI>Atoms,</HI> or such movable ones that are al∣together
unlike the solid Bodies we now
behold. So that to account for the pro∣duction
of this present state of things, be∣sides
their Matter and Motion, the <HI>Abet∣tors</HI>
of this Opinion want a Principle for
Solidity or Cohesion and Elasticity; Both
which are owing to no essential Property
of Matter, as is shewn in the two last Se∣ctions
of the preceding Chapter.</P>
<P>§ VIII. There are several <HI>Appearances</HI>
absolutely unaccountable from the Laws
of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> and consequently these
cou'd never be produc'd by Matter and
Motion alone, or any <HI>Combinations</HI> of
them. It were endless to allege all the
Instances that might be brought on this
Head, some few of the most considerable
<PB N="15" REF="166"/>
will suffice; for if any one be inconsistent
with the Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> then it is
impossible this <HI>Systeme</HI> cou'd have been
produc'd by the concourse of <HI>Atoms.</HI> The
first I shall instance in, is that great Law
to which all the Bodies of this Universe are
subject, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Gravitation.</HI> In
the former <HI>Chapter</HI> I have endeavour'd to
shew that this Property is not <HI>essential</HI> to
Matter, nor can arise from the Figure, Tex∣ture
or Motions of its Parts, but is <HI>implan∣ted</HI>
therein by some Power superiour to
that of Matter; whence it is evident that
one of the primary Attributes of Matter
is independent of the Laws of <HI>Mechanism.</HI>
That active Principle which animates as it
were the dead Mass of Bodies, and which
is the Cause of all the beautiful <HI>Appearan∣ces</HI>
of Nature, owes its Origin to some∣thing
different from Matter and Motion,
and therefore this <HI>System</HI> of things cou'd
not arise from thence.</P>
<P>§ IX. Not only <HI>Gravitation,</HI> or that
implanted Principle whereby Bodies tend
towards one another, is above the Powers
<PB N="16" REF="167"/>
of Matter, but all the Effects and Appea∣rances
that necessarily depend thereupon,
<HI>i. e.</HI> all the <HI>Celestial</HI> and <HI>Terrestrial Appea∣rances</HI>
are likewise above the Powers and
Laws of Matter and Motion. All the At∣tempts
of others before Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> to
explain the regular and constant <HI>Appearan∣ces</HI>
of Nature, were most of 'em <HI>Ʋngeo∣metrical,</HI>
and all of 'em so inconsistent or
unintelligible, that it was as hard to allow
their <HI>Postulata</HI> as to conceive the thing
which they pretended to account for
from them. All the <HI>Philosophers</HI> that ever
were, cou'd never from the meer Laws
of <HI>Mechanism</HI> explain how the Planets came
to move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, they might
(if Matter had been self-moving) have for
ever stray'd in right Lines; but, that
they should constantly revolve in Orbits,
that they should approach to and remove
from a determin'd point at different Sea∣sons,
and that uniformly and constant∣ly,
is altogether unaccountable from the
Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> as has been shewn in
the former <HI>Chapter.</HI> But from this im∣planted
<PB N="17" REF="168"/>
Principle of Gravitation, all the
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> are accounted for, and that
to the greatest nicety we are capable of
distinguishing. So that not only this Uni∣verse
cou'd not have been produc'd by the
Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> but there is scarce a
single <HI>Appearance</HI> that can thence ade∣quately
be accounted for.</P>
<P>§ X. The Production of Animals is
altogether inconsistent with the Laws of
<HI>Mechanism.</HI> 1. The Blood is squeez'd by
the force of the Heart from the left <HI>Ven∣tricle,</HI>
through the Arteries unto the Ex∣tremities
of the Body, and is thence re∣turn'd
by the Veins into the right <HI>Ventri∣cle;</HI>
thence by the <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis</HI> unto
the <HI>Lungs,</HI> from the <HI>Lungs</HI> by the <HI>Vena
Pulmonalis</HI> to the right <HI>Ventricle</HI> again.
The Motion of the Heart is caus'd by the
nervous Juices mixing with the Blood in
the <HI>Muscular</HI> part thereof. And these
nervous Juices are both deriv'd from the
Blood, and forc'd into the <HI>Muscular</HI> part
of the Heart, by the Motion of the Heart
itself, the Texture of their containing Ves∣sels,
<PB N="18" REF="169"/>
and perhaps by the pulsation of the
Arteries upon the Nerves in the Brain.
Here now the Heart is the Cause of the
Motion of the Blood in the Arteries, and
the Motion of the Blood in the <HI>Arteries</HI>
urging their Juices through the Nerves, is
the Cause of the Motion of the Heart,
which is a plain <HI>Circulation</HI> of <HI>Mechanical</HI>
Powers; <HI>i. e.</HI> a <HI>Perpetuum Mobile,</HI> which
by what was said in the preceding Chap∣ter
is contrary to the Laws of <HI>Mechanism.</HI>
If an <HI>Epicurean Philosopher</HI> cou'd contrive
a <HI>Water Machin</HI> that the Water shou'd
move the <HI>Machin,</HI> and the <HI>Machin</HI> the
Water; so that the same Water shou'd
constantly return in a Circle to move the
Machin: I shou'd then think their <HI>Scheme</HI>
somewhat feasible. But, since the first
is demonstrably impossible, the latter must
be so likewise. 2. In all Animals there
are <HI>Organs</HI> in number actually indefinite
if not infinite. By an <HI>Organ</HI> I mean a
distinct independent part of a <HI>Machin:</HI> Thus
a Wheel and all its parts is an <HI>Organ</HI> of a
Watch, if I may speak so; and a <HI>Gland</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="170"/>
with all its parts, or a Canal from its Origin
to its Extremity is an <HI>Organ</HI> in an Animal
Body. Now these Organs or independent
parts in the Animal, are infinitely many,
which is evident both from the Nature of
<HI>Sensation</HI> and <HI>Nutrition. Sensation</HI> is per∣form'd
by the mediation of an <HI>Organ</HI> ari∣sing
from the Brain and continued through
the part affected. Now there is not the
least imaginable solid part of the Vessels
or Muscles but is sensible, and therefore
the Organs in Animals that convey this
Sensation, are infinite in Number. To
this perhaps it may be objected, that one
<HI>Organ</HI> may convey <HI>Sensation</HI> through se∣veral
places, and consequently tho' ev'ry
minute part of the Body be sensible, it will
not follow that the Organs which convey
this <HI>Sensation</HI> are infinitely many, since they
may all be only the continuation of some
few <HI>Organs</HI> through different parts. But
the Answer is obvious, if every point of
the Vessels and Muscles of the Animal Bo∣dy
be sensible, then the <HI>Organs</HI> which
convey the Sensation are infinitely small,
<PB N="20" REF="171"/>
and if infinitely small they must be infi∣nitely
many, seeing their Extremities in
the Brain constitute a finite <HI>Superficies,</HI> or
fill a finite Space: For a finite number of in∣finitely
small parts can never make a finite
Quantity. Again, <HI>Nutrition</HI> is perform'd
by an Organ, through which the Supply
is convey'd to the Place to be nourish'd,
and since there is no part of the Body that
may not be encreas'd or diminish'd (as is
evident from the Cure of Wounds in all
Places through which the necessary part of
the Fluids of the Body can pass) it is plain
that ev'ry individual point of the Ani∣mal
Body is the termination of an <HI>Organ</HI>
through which the <HI>Nutrition</HI> may be con∣vey'd.
Moreover seeing even the Canals
themselves do encrease in bulk, may de∣cay
and be impair'd, ev'ry assignable part
of these Canals must be the termination
of some <HI>secretory</HI> Duct separating a fluid
fit to encrease their Dimensions or repair
their Losses; and these secretory Chanels
again must have others to encrease <HI>their</HI>
bulk or repair <HI>their</HI> Losses, and so on <HI>in
<PB N="21" REF="172"/>
infinitum.</HI> Add to all these, that the fi∣nest
Glasses discover nothing in the seve∣ral
parts of the Vessels and Muscles but
fine slender Canals; and the better the
<HI>Microscopes</HI> are, the greater Number of
those capillary Pipes are discovered; and
these parts which were formerly reckon'd
<HI>Parenchymatous</HI> are now found to be bun∣dles
or heaps of exceedingly small Tubes
or Threads. The Muscles themselves con∣sist
of a Number of Fibres, and each Fi∣bre
of an incredible Number of little <HI>Fi∣brils,</HI>
bound together and divided into
little Cells or <HI>Vesicles,</HI> the Glands are no∣thing
but a <HI>clew</HI> of little slender Pipes di∣versly
rolled or folded together; the <HI>Brain</HI>
is a numberless <HI>Congeries</HI> of infinitely small
Tubes woven into several Figures; the
<HI>Nerves</HI> are bundles of small <HI>cylindrical</HI>
Pipes; and the <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Liver</HI> are but
Heaps of little Bladders upon which the
Blood Vessels are spread in Net-work; or
of little Glands among which these Vessels
are dispersed. In one Word, all the so∣lid
parts of the Body are nothing, but
<PB N="22" REF="173"/>
either very fine exceeding small Tubes for
the conveyance of some fluid, or slender
Threads, in Bundles ty'd together by
others surrounding'em, or going from one
Fibre to another, or spread out into thin
Membranes: For the <HI>Bones</HI> are nothing
but such Bundles, and all the Membranes
or Membranons Coats of the Vessels, are
nothing but these Threads wrought toge∣ther
into thin Skins. From all which it
is beyond dispute, that every Animal is
made of Organs in Number really infinite.
For these Organs become at last infinitely
small, and so their Sum must be infinitely
many, seing it constitutes a finite Quantity.
Now how ridiculous is it to imagine a
thing so wonderfully made cou'd be the
Effect of meer Chance, or of the blind
Laws of Motion. In <HI>Artificial Machines,</HI>
the more complicated and compounded
the Contrivance of the Parts is, the grea∣ter
the difficulty is in adjusting them; and
the difficulty encreases in the same proporti∣on
the <HI>complications</HI> do, and consequent∣ly
when the <HI>complications</HI> are infinite the
<PB N="23" REF="174"/>
Machin is altogether above the Power of
<HI>Mechanicks,</HI> and quite impracticable by the
Laws of Matter and Motion: But this is
exactly the present Case, and therefore the
Production of an Animal is altogether <HI>im∣mechanical.</HI>
3. Allowing Animals might
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been produc'd by the casual concourse
of <HI>Atoms,</HI> why do not these very same Cau∣ses
continually operate, and why do we not
see the same Effects in our Days (since the
Causes continue the same) that were beheld
in former Times? If any of the <HI>Philoso∣phers</HI>
shou'd shew us such an Appearance;
nay, if they wou'd but tell us (without
runing upon Contradictions) how such
a <HI>Machin</HI> might be produc'd, we might
begin to hearken to their Pretences. But
since such a thing was never seen nor pre∣tended,
it's very arrogant in them to think
People shou'd believe the Matter without
any Reason upon their meer Word. No
Body now-a-days that understands any
thing of Nature or <HI>Philosophy</HI> can so much
as imagine that any Animal how abject so∣ever
can be produc'd by an <HI>equivocal Ge∣neration,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="175"/>
or without the conjunction of
Male and Female Parents, in the same or
in two different Individuals. And very few
who have considered the Matter but own
that ev'ry Animal proceeds from a pre∣existent
<HI>Animalcul,</HI> and that the Parents
conduce nothing but a convenient Habita∣tion
and suitable Nourishments to it, till
it be fit to be trusted with the Light, and
capable of receiving the Benefit of the Air.
We know very well that there is nothing
in the <HI>Animal Machin,</HI> but an infinity of
branching and winding Canals, fill'd with
Liquors of different Natures, going the
same perpetual round which are no more
capable of producing the wonderful Fabrick
of another Animal, than a thing is of ma∣king
itself. Besides, in the <HI>Generation</HI> of
an Animal, there is a necessity that the
<HI>Head, Heart, Nerves, Veins</HI> and <HI>Arteries</HI>
shou'd be form'd at the same time, which
can never be done by the Motion of any
fluid what way soever mov'd; for as hath
been just now said, the Heart cannot
move, unless Animal Spirits, be sent from
<PB N="25" REF="176"/>
the Head through the Nerves into it; the
Animal Spirits cannot be deriv'd into the
Heart unless the Blood be squeez'd by the
Heart through the Arteries into the Brain.
So that it is evident that the Head and
Heart, the Arteries Veins and Nerves must
be all form'd at the same time, if the Ani∣mal
is <HI>Mechanically</HI> produc'd. But this is
altogether impossible, for no Motion of
any fluid or fluids howsoever disposed can
form all these at the same instant. And
we know all the internal <HI>Mechanical</HI> Acti∣ons
of Animals are perform'd by the force
of their fluids. Let any one consider the
<HI>Infinity</HI> of Canals and other Organical
parts in an Animal, and again consider
that all that one Animal can conduce to∣ward
the <HI>Generation</HI> of another is by the
force of some Liquors through some Ca∣nals,
and try if from this Power he be
able to form the Idea of the <HI>Generation</HI>
of an Animal. It is doing Penance to
read the wretched Accounts of the wisest
and most learned <HI>Philosophers</HI> on this Head.
To observe how in every step they con∣tradict
<PB N="26" REF="177"/>
the known Laws of Motion; and
indeed the manner after which they wou'd
have 'em generated is as much above the
Power and beyond the Laws of <HI>Mechanism</HI>
as the true and genuin Manner and Me∣thod
of their Production is. From all these
Considerations, it is evident that an Ani∣mal
cannot be produc'd mechanically, it
is too hard a Probleme to be solv'd from
so few <HI>data</HI> as Matter and Motion. For
indeed cou'd this one be once solv'd by
any of the <HI>Philosophers</HI> we shou'd be ea∣sily
satisfy'd of the rest, tho' Plants and
all the vegetable Kingdom be liable to the
same Difficulties, and furnish us with the
same Objections; for they are indeed only
Animals of a lower Rank. And cou'd it
be once prov'd either by <HI>Demonstration</HI> or
by <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> that a Plant or an Ani∣mal
cou'd be produc'd by <HI>Mechanism, i. e.</HI>
Nature, or the Laws of Motion, the thought∣ful
parts of Mankind wou'd be easily temp∣ted
to believe, that since the better part
was produc'd by Mechanism, the meaner
<HI>i. e.</HI> all the rest of this visible World might
<PB N="27" REF="178"/>
have been form'd the same way. So that
it is a Matter of the greatest Consequence
that we have demonstrated, that neither
Animals nor Vegetables can be produc'd
<HI>Mechanically.</HI> There are many other Ar∣guments
which I can produce to prove the
same Proposition which the Language I
write in will not permit me to set forth.</P>
<P>§ XI. The <HI>Spontaneous</HI> Motions of the sen∣sitive
part of this <HI>Systeme</HI> is an eternal con∣tradition
to the Laws of <HI>Mechanism.</HI> We
have sufficiently shewn that neither <HI>Spon∣taneous</HI>
(nor indeed any) Motion is essen∣tial
to Matter, it is determin'd to one di∣rection
(while in Motion) which it can
no more alter than move of itself. This
our Senses may daily inform us of, the
Ball goes on in the direction of the Club
or of the Body of the Piece out of which
it is shot, the Arrow in that given it by
the Bowstring, and the Hand of the Dial∣plate
in that given it by the Wheels, and
that necessarily and constantly if not forc'd
out of the same by some foreign Violence.
But all <HI>Sensitive</HI> Animals have a <HI>Self-moti∣on,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="179"/>
can turn and wind, move through all
the points of the Compass, go back and
forward as their Occasions require, or In∣clinations
prompt 'em. It's true, some of
our Modern <HI>Philosophers</HI> have asserted,
that the <HI>Brute-Creation</HI> are only pieces of
Clock-work, and that all their Motions
are as necessarily determin'd as that of the
Dial-plate. But this is meerly precarious,
and may be deny'd as easily as it is con∣fidently
alleg'd. Besides the Demonstra∣tions
<HI>à priori</HI> I have just now brought to
evince the contrary, the Observation and
Experience of all Mankind contradicts it.
The <HI>Docility</HI> and <HI>Segacity</HI> of some Animals
demonstrate the contrary, and some <HI>Brute-Animals</HI>
shew more Indications of it than
some of the Race of Mankind on whom
they bestow it. What more evident Proofs
of a <HI>spontaneous</HI> Motion cou'd these poor
Creatures give than they do, if they were
really suppos'd to be endow'd with it? No∣thing
but a sensation in our selves of the
<HI>Principle</HI> of their Actions cou'd create
clearer Evidences of a <HI>spontaneous</HI> Motion.
<PB N="29" REF="180"/>
Besides, it is altogether impossible to ac∣count
for the far greater part of their A∣ctions
and Motions from <HI>Mechanism,</HI> as
we have in the preceding Propositions
shewn at large. And we shou'd be strange∣ly
surpriz'd if by any combination of ma∣terial
Organs, we shou'd produce the smal∣lest
part of their Actions and Passions.
Wherefore since the sensitive World is en∣dow'd
with <HI>spontaneous</HI> Motions, and since
this is far beyond and above the Powers of
Matter, it is evident this Universe cou'd
not have been produc'd <HI>Mechanically.</HI></P>
<P>§ XII. The <HI>Voluntary Motions</HI> of Ra∣tional
Creatures are altogether unaccoun∣table
from the Laws of <HI>Mechanism.</HI> Mus∣cular
Motion is perform'd much after such
a manner as this; the Muscles are Bundles
of Fibres, which being closely compacted
at both ends make their two <HI>Tendons,</HI> each
of which is inserted into some one fixt
part of the Body or other, every one of
these Fibres consists of a prodigious Num∣ber
of lesser Fibres or <HI>Fibrils</HI> which are
so many very slender elastick Canals bound
<PB N="30" REF="181"/>
about by small transwerse parallell Threads
which divide these hollow <HI>Fibrils</HI> into so
many elastick <HI>Cystes</HI> or <HI>Vesiculae,</HI> as if a
Gut were ty'd at equal distances. Into
every one of these <HI>Vesiculae,</HI> an Artery,
Vein, and Nerve enter, the two first to
bring and carry back the Blood, the lat∣ter
to carry thither likewise its proper flu∣id;
which mixing in the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> with the
Blood, produces a rarefaction (the manner
how, foravoiding Disputes, I shall forbear
at present to determine) whereby these
<HI>Vesiculae</HI> are distended, and their <HI>Longi∣tudinal
Diameters</HI> (from Knot to Knot)
straitned, and so the length of the whole
Muscle shortned. The Nerves are the <HI>se∣cretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Glandulous</HI> Substance
of the Brain, and consequently are much
of the same Nature, with the other <HI>Ex∣cretories</HI>
of the Body, which are nothing
but small slender slips of the Arteries for
deriving an appropriated Juice from the
Blood. Wherefore since the nervous Juice
is form'd out of the Blood, and since the
Nerves are very small Arterial Tubes, this
<PB N="31" REF="182"/>
Juice must move in these Nerves after the
same manner the Blood does in the Arte∣ries;
only with this difference, that it moves
abundantly more slow, (its Velocity be∣ing
abated either by the many circumvo∣lutions
of the Artery in the <HI>Gland,</HI> which
is the Origin of the Nerve, or by the re∣sistence
the Juice meets with in the slender
Pipe of the Nerve it self.) If the <HI>circula∣tion</HI>
of the Blood be admitted, and all
the Juices of the Body be allow'd to be
deriv'd from it, 'tis impossible that any
of these Juices shou'd stagnat in their Ves∣sels
longer than till they be fill'd. And
therefore the nervous Juice in its Channels
is propell'd after the same manner and by
the same Mechanism the Blood is urg'd
forward in the Arteries. Now in the Mus∣cles
of involuntary Motion, such as the
Heart, the Lungs, the Stomach and Guts,
and the muscular Coats of the Vessels,
this nervous Juice is constantly deriv'd by
a <HI>Mechanical</HI> Necessity. In the Heart,
while the <HI>Auricles</HI> are full of Blood, they
are distended, and the influence of the
<PB N="32" REF="183"/>
nervous Juices into their Muscles thereby
stop'd; but when once this Blood begins
to flow into the <HI>Ventricles,</HI> the resistence
arising from the distension of the <HI>Auricles</HI>
to the influx of the nervous Juice is taken
off, and so it flows into the muscular Sub∣stance
of the <HI>Auricles</HI> and thereby they
are contracted, while the <HI>Ventricles</HI> are di∣stended,
and the influx of the nervous
Juice into their Muscles is thereby stop'd,
till the Blood be deriv'd into the <HI>Aorta,</HI>
and the Impediment from this distension
to the influx of the nervous Juice be taken
off, and so the <HI>Ventricles</HI> come into Con∣traction;
which hinders the Blood from run∣ing
any more into the <HI>Ventricles</HI> from the <HI>Au∣ricles,</HI>
and then the <HI>Auricles</HI> are again fill'd:
And thus, by a <HI>Mechanical</HI> Necessity they
act <HI>alternately,</HI> the Auricles and Ventricles
being as it were <HI>Antagonists</HI> to one another;
so as that while these are distended those
are contracted, the distension of the first
permitting the influence of the nervous
Juice into the latter; and so on the other
hand. After the same manner are the <HI>mus∣cular</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="184"/>
Coats of the Blood Vessels, and of
the Coats of the other Vessels containing
Liquors deriv'd from the Blood, <HI>alternate∣ly</HI>
contracted and dilated; for by the con∣traction
of the Heart the Blood is thrown
into the Arteries, which distends them,
and so the influence of the nervous Juice
into their Muscular Coat is hindred; but
when the Blood is by the <HI>impetus</HI> it has
conceiv'd deriv'd into the Veins, this im∣pediment
is taken off, and the Muscular
Coats of the Arteries then act, the <HI>Mem∣branous</HI>
by their <HI>Elasticity</HI> concurring. In
the Lungs the Gravity of the <HI>Atmosphere</HI>
forces the Air into the small orbicular Ve∣sicles
thereof, and dilates the Cavity of
the Breast; whereby the pressure of its
Sides upon them, and the Nerves that act
in this function is taken off, and so the
Muscles of the <HI>diafragm</HI> and the other
concurring ones are at freedom to act,
and to distend the Cavity of the <HI>thorax,</HI>
till the pressure of the sides of the Breast
become too strong for these opposite com∣bin'd
dilating Causes; and then by their
<PB N="34" REF="185"/>
own Gravity and the elastick force of the
Ribs they fall down and compress the
Lungs and shut np the Emissaries of the
Nerves. So likewise in the Stomach and
Guts, when the <HI>Longitudinal Muscular</HI>
Fibres are in Action, the <HI>Transverse</HI> and
<HI>Spiral</HI> ones ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relax'd by the pressure of
the acting Fibres upon the Emissaries of
the Nerves of the relax'd ones; and so on
the other Hand, when those are relax'd
these are in action, and universally in all
the <HI>involuntary</HI> Motions there is a <HI>Mecha∣nical</HI>
Necessity for the derivation of the
nervous Juices into the Muscles employed
in these Motions. But in voluntary Mo∣tions
there neither is nor can be any such
Mechanical Necessity, it being a plain
Contradiction to their Nature; and there∣fore
voluntary Motion is quite contrary
to the Laws of <HI>Mechanism:</HI> we can move
our Hands and Feet how and when we
please in an Instant, we can bend and un∣bend'
em as we will. There is no <HI>Mecha∣nical</HI>
Cause imaginable to force this ner∣vous
Juice into the Muscles of voluntary
<PB N="35" REF="186"/>
Motion, and no Motion can follow unless
this Juice be deriv'd, as is plain from hence,
that cuting the Nerves that serve any Mus∣cle,
tho' all other things continue the
same, yet no Motion will follow. And
the only Conception we can form of vo∣luntary
Motions, is that the Mind like a
skilful <HI>Musician</HI> strikes upon that Nerve
which conveys animal Spirits to the Mus∣cle
to be contracted, and adds a greater
force than the natural to the nervous Juice,
whereby it opens its Passage into the Ve∣sicles
of which the Muscular Fibres con∣sist,
which it cou'd not have done by its
natural Power. But this Action of the
Mind or Will upon these Animal Spirits
being altogether unaccountable from the
Laws of Motion, it is plain that volun∣tary
Motion is altogether <HI>immechanical.</HI>
And indeed were it <HI>Mechanical,</HI> it cou'd
not be Voluntary; for what ever acts
<HI>Mechanically,</HI> acts constantly and neces∣sarily,
and so can never act volunta∣rily.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="187"/>
§ XIII. That <HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> of
choosing or refusing which we find in our
selves is altogether inconsistent with <HI>Me∣chanism.</HI>
Some Men indeed deny that
we have any Free-will at all; but these
need only examine their own Consciences
to be convinc'd of their mistake; they
will find that even when their Reason
wou'd determine 'em to do such a thing,
they have in their Power to forbear it or
to do the contrary; they can rise or sit still,
go backward or forward, to shew their
own <HI>Freedom;</HI> they can choose the time
and Place the Degrees and Circumstances
of all these Actions that are call'd free.
It's true some of our natural Actions are
necessary, but these which are commonly
call'd voluntary Actions, are as much free
as the nature of things will permit them.
Their Power being limited, I wou'd glad∣ly
know what greater <HI>Indications</HI> of free∣dom
they cou'd wish to have, than they
now have. The Passions of Mankind
(which in most, determine their Actions)
are indeed violent, but they have it in
<PB N="37" REF="188"/>
their Power to suspend for some time
the satisfying of them; which shews they
are not necessarily determin'd toward their
Satisfaction; for the Action of necessary
Agents can only be suspended by a Mira∣cle.
Let us suppose that Man in a per∣fect
state of Health, is free and has a Pow∣er
of <HI>election;</HI> the only <HI>Indications</HI> he cou'd
give of this Freedom, are by doing the
contrary, where there are weighty and
solid Reasons for doing such a thing; or
by making an <HI>Election</HI> among many things,
when there is no imaginable Reason to
determine him more to one than another;
or to be able to suspend the effect of na∣tural
Actions, when without this interpo∣sition
they wou'd <HI>Mechanically</HI> operate.
Now it's certain that we are capable of
giving all these <HI>Indications,</HI> to shew our
Freedom: we have it in our Power to hurt
or even destroy our selves tho' there be
the best Reasons in the World to hinder
us from so doing, we can take out the
one and not the other, in two or more of
the same things in all Circumstances alike:
<PB N="38" REF="189"/>
Tho' <HI>Respiration</HI> be reckon'd an involuntary
Action, and tho' it is certainly perform'd
<HI>mechanically</HI> and uniformly, yet we have
it in our Power to keep in our Breaths
and to suspend the efficacy of this natural
<HI>Function</HI> for some time; and this seems
to be one of the most evident <HI>Indications</HI>
of Freedom that can possibly be desired.
For tho' in other Cases it may be alledg'd
that it is the subtil and <HI>imperceptible</HI> man∣ner
after which we are determin'd that
makes any of our Actions seem free, yet
in this Instance that Objection can have
no Place; for if we are determin'd ever
so <HI>imperceptibly,</HI> it is by the Neces∣sity
of Nature we are determin'd. Now
it is absurd to think that Nature shou'd
determine any natural <HI>Function</HI> to be per∣form'd
regularly and constantly the same
way, and that by <HI>Mechanical</HI> Laws, and
at the same time determine this <HI>Function</HI>
to be irregularly and uncertainly suspen∣ded.
On the other Hand, if we are ne∣cessarily
determin'd in all our Actions,
and if we have no Freedom, it is abso∣lutely
<PB N="39" REF="190"/>
impossible we shou'd make any E∣lection
among things in all Circumstances
alike; for if we are determin'd, it can
only be from the things themselves with∣out
us, for all things within us are upon
this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> to be suppos'd to move
uniformly and <HI>Mechanically.</HI> Now where
the things without us are in all Circum∣stances
alike, we can never be determin'd
to any one of them by themselves. And
therefore were we not free, we cou'd ne∣ver
make an Election among things alto∣gether
alike. By things altogether alike,
I mean such as are alike as to all the Cir∣cumstances
necessary to constitute them
the things requir'd. Thus two Farthings
are altogether alike, tho' they may differ
in some small Circumstances that do not
concern the <HI>Essence</HI> of that <HI>Species</HI> of Coin.
Thus 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. are equally odd Num∣bers,
and 2. 4. 6. 8. equally even Num∣bers,
and if it were propos'd to assign an
even or odd Number, there are infinitely
many which are equally such. The same
thing happens in the Answers to all these
<PB N="40" REF="191"/>
<HI>Problems</HI> which are call'd <HI>indetermin'd;</HI>
and in assigning one of the Answers to
any such <HI>Problems,</HI> there is nothing in their
Nature that can possibly determine us,
the Conditions of the Problem only being
had respect to. And therefore such
things as these are only pitch'd upon by
the energy of our Wills or Freedom. But
no Arguments will make a Man confess
he feels, if he be obstinately resolv'd not
to confess it. Now Liberty is a thing
felt, and is only to be found by a <HI>reflex∣ion</HI>
on our selves and our Actions; but
there is one Argument which will always
have weight with the wiser and better
part of Mankind. And that is that with∣out
Free-will, Virtue and Vice, Justice and
Injustice are only bare Words. Now if
Rational Creatures be free, as most cer∣tainly
they are, this Freedom is a plain
downright Contradiction to <HI>Mechanism,</HI>
for <HI>Mechanism</HI> produces all its Effects ne∣cessarily.</P>
<P>§ XIV. Having I think sufficiently
shewn the Inconsistency and Impossibility
<PB N="41" REF="192"/>
of the <HI>Epicurean Scheme.</HI> I come to the
second Opinion about the <HI>Origination</HI> of
the Universe, which in few Words tells
us very positively, that this present state
of things has been from all <HI>Eternity</HI> of it∣self,
so as we now behold it; and that
any Changes that have happen'd therein,
have proceeded from the Laws of <HI>Mecha∣nism</HI>
that now obtain in the World. This
<HI>Scheme</HI> consists principally of these two
Parts. 1. That this World has been
for <HI>ever</HI> in the state we now behold it.
2. That it has been so for <HI>ever</HI> of itself,
independent of any other Cause. This
Opinion is commonly, but falsly ascrib'd
to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> not as its first <HI>Broacher</HI> but as its
ablest <HI>Patron.</HI> But tho' <HI>Aristotle</HI> held the
first part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the World was
from all <HI>Eternity</HI> as we now behold it, yet
he did not think it was so <HI>of it self;</HI> and
there is a very great Difference betwixt
allowing this present <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Ʋni∣verse</HI>
to have been created from all <HI>Eter∣nity</HI>
by an <HI>Omnipotent Cause,</HI> and believing
it to have been for <HI>ever</HI> of itself without
<PB N="42" REF="193"/>
any <HI>Cause.</HI> My Design in the following
Discourse is not to dispute against any
<HI>Scheme</HI> of those who admit the Existence
of a <HI>Deity,</HI> I intend only to shew, that
this present state of things cou'd not have
been from all <HI>Eternity,</HI> neither of it self,
nor without the frequent and particular
interposition of a <HI>Divine Power;</HI> and to
make it plain that naturally and of itself it
tends to <HI>Dissolution;</HI> Tho' in the mean
time, it is not to be doubted but that
that <HI>Almighty Power</HI> which cou'd create
this <HI>beautiful System</HI> of things, can pre∣serve
it in being as long as He pleases.</P>
<P>§ XV. That this Universe cou'd never
have been ftom all <HI>Eternity</HI> of itself, in
the present condition it now is, is evident
from hence, that it requires an <HI>extrinsick
Principle</HI> for its subsisting in its present
Condition. If one shou'd see a Piece of
<HI>Clock-work,</HI> pointing out the Divisions of
time exactly and regularly, he might have
some Difficulties about the manner of its
Production; but if he shou'd see or learn
that it requir'd some <HI>Foreign Assistance</HI> to
<PB N="43" REF="194"/>
keep it a going, that its Motion depended
upon some Principle without itself, that
it requir'd winding up of the Spring or
Weights, he wou'd be soon satisfy'd it
cou'd not have been from all Eternity of
itself in the state he then beheld it. Now
this is the very Condition of the <HI>Earth,</HI> the
<HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> and of all the <HI>Celestial</HI>
and <HI>Terrestrial</HI> Appearances. Their Mo∣tions
and Actions depend upon a Principle
quite <HI>extrinsick</HI> to Matter, which arises from
none of its Powers or Properties, as has been
shown in the former Chapter. The Power
which produces and preserves their Moti∣ons,
springs from something without them∣selves,
and if this Power were suspended
or withdrawn, they wou'd immediately
stop and their Motions wou'd be destroy'd,
and they wou'd become a lifeless unactive
heap of Matter. And this Power is no∣thing
else but that universal Law of Gra∣vitation,
which <HI>actuates</HI> the whole frame
of all the <HI>Systems</HI> of Bodies; which pro∣ceeds
from a Principle both independent
of, and distinct from Matter and all its Fa∣culties.
<PB N="44" REF="195"/>
Wherefore it is altogether impos∣sible
this present state of things shou'd
have been from all Eternity <HI>of itself,</HI> since
at present it cannot subsist in a regular
and beautiful <HI>System</HI> without the perpe∣tual
influence of some superiour and <HI>ex∣trinsick</HI>
Power.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Whatever depends upon ano∣ther
thing as its <HI>Cause,</HI> as also, whatever
is necessarily requir'd for the Existence or
Preservation of another thing, these cou'd
not have been from all Eternity <HI>of them∣selves;</HI>
for <HI>Self-existence</HI> necessarily implies
independency as to Existence on any other
thing, either as Cause or as Effect; (I mean
only of those things which are about us,
<HI>viz.</HI> The visible things of this World,
which have but Qualities both finite in
Number and Degree; and consequently
have <HI>assignable</HI> relations to and dependen∣ces
upon one another; for it is otherwise
in the <HI>Immense Being</HI> in respect of his
Creatures, which can have no Proportion
to him, and he no dependence on them.)
And when a thing depends upon another
<PB N="45" REF="196"/>
thing as its Cause, this implies that the
first thing exists that the second <HI>may ex∣ist;</HI>
which supposes Design and Contri∣vance,
and consequently is a sign of Pro∣duction
or Creation, and not of the Self-existence
of these things. Likewise, when
a thing is necessarily requir'd for the Ex∣istence
or Preservation of another, it plain∣ly
implies that the first thing exists that
the second <HI>may exist,</HI> which likewise sup∣poses
<HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> and conse∣quently
can be no sign of <HI>Self-existence</HI>
in these things. Now is there any thing
more plain, than that most of the things
in this our <HI>System</HI> are necessary or useful
towards the Being or Preservation of <HI>Man∣kind.</HI>
Remove the <HI>Sun</HI> from us, or us
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Earth cou'd bring
forth no Fruits for our Support; take
away the <HI>Moon,</HI> the <HI>Seas</HI> wou'd stagnat
and the Fish be destroy'd; level our
<HI>Mountains</HI> we shou'd have no fresh Waters;
destroy our <HI>Atmosphere</HI> or the Airs Elasti∣city,
we shou'd swell-like poysoned Rats.
Do not these and a thousand other Instan∣ces
<PB N="46" REF="197"/>
I cou'd allege, demonstrate that all
the Beings of this Universe exist as the ne∣cessary
Effect, or for the Existence or Pre∣servation
of other Beings, and consequent∣ly
imply <HI>Contrivance</HI> and <HI>Design;</HI> which
is a most evident sign that all these things
have been produc'd and are not Self-ex∣istent.
If a wild <HI>Scythian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> who
never saw a House in his Life, shou'd
meet with a <HI>Noble Palace</HI> neatly finish'd
and finely furnish'd, and about it shou'd
find Creatures that cou'd not subsist with∣out
such a Convenience, and shou'd plain∣ly
discover, that the Accommodations and
Conveniences of this <HI>Building</HI> were ex∣actly
suited in every Circumstance to the
Wants and Necessities of these Creatures;
I think he wou'd have no difficulty in con∣cluding
that this House was built by some
wise <HI>Architect</HI> for the Convenience of these
Creatures, he wou'd certainly never dream
that it had for ever been there of itself so
as he then beheld it. Now this is the ve∣ry
Case betwixt us and the <HI>System</HI> of
things about us; not that I think the
<PB N="47" REF="198"/>
whole <HI>Systeme</HI> of the Universe was made
for us of the <HI>Race of Mankind,</HI> but that
we cannot be without a great many of
these things that are round us, and that
consequently we were some part in the
design of them, and so they cou'd not have
been for ever of 'emselves.</P>
<P>§ XVII. That <HI>Animals</HI> cou'd not have
been from all Eternity is plain, for both
the Reasons alleged in the two former
Sections. For 1. Their Production
and Existence depend upon Principles
quite extrinsick from and independent of
themselves, I mean of their <HI>Material part.</HI>
I have formerly shown, that they can nei∣ther
subsist nor be produc'd by the Pow∣ers
of <HI>Mechanism;</HI> but for both require
the constant influence of a Principle even
different from that which governs the in∣animated
part of the Universe, <HI>viz. Gra∣vitation.</HI>
Now all that is observable in
this World, (according to this <HI>Scheme</HI>)
is Matter and Motion (for if we once al∣low
a Power distinct from these, we ruin
this <HI>Hypothesis;</HI> for we do not then know
<PB N="48" REF="199"/>
how far the influence of this Power may
reach, as to the Production and Preserva∣tion
of the present state of things.) But
the Production and Preservation of <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
is above the Powers of Matter as has
been formerly shown, and therefore since
they depend upon a Principle distinct from
and independent of the Laws of <HI>Mecha∣nism,</HI>
and need a continual influence of
some Principle, distinct from Matter and
its Properties, they cou'd not have been
for ever of themselves. 2. All the seve∣ral
Parts and Organs of the Animal Body
are so prudently adapted to the benefit
of the whole <HI>Compositum</HI> as plainly implies
Design and Contrivance, that it is impos∣sible
to consider this, and imagine they
have been Self-existent. How wisely are
the <HI>Bones articulated?</HI> How prudently the
<HI>Muscles</HI> contriv'd? and how conveniently
fastned to the several Places of the Body
to produce the necessary Motions? With
what Judgment are the <HI>Arteries, Veins</HI>
and <HI>Nerves</HI> rang'd? With what Wisdom
are their fluids dispos'd in their proper
<PB N="49" REF="200"/>
Vessels? How carefully is the propagati∣on
of the <HI>Species</HI> provided for according
to several Circumstances arising from the
particular Climate and Element each <HI>Ani∣mal</HI>
is confin'd to, and how justly is eve∣ry
Particular adapted for the Benefit of
the whole compound? I shall have occa∣sion
to pursue these Instances farther here∣after,
but any Body who is ever so lit∣tle
acquainted with the <HI>structure</HI> of an
<HI>Animal,</HI> cannot but discover evident Foot∣steps
of <HI>Design and Contrivance</HI> in it, and
therefore Animals cannot be Self-exi∣stent.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. It has been formerly shewn
in § XXX. and its Corollary of the pre∣ceding
Chapter, that some part of the
nourishment of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and the greatest part requir'd to the pro∣duction
of <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI> is a wa∣tery
Fluid, impregnated with some other
Body, which by these Operations upon
Matter is chang'd into a solid Form, of
which but a very small part is ever resolv'd
into Water again, whereby the quantity
<PB N="50" REF="201"/>
of Water on this our Globe is daily im∣pair'd
and diminish'd; wherefore if the
World had lasted from all Eternity in the
State it now is, we had long since wan∣ted
both salt and fresh Water. And in∣deed
this decrease of the Quantity of Wa∣ter
on our Globe is so considerable, that
a <HI>very great Man</HI> is of Opinion that the
<HI>Comets</HI> were design'd to supply the same,
which when they come nigh our Dwelling,
send us such a Quantity of Vapours from
their <HI>prodigious</HI> Tails, as is sufficient to
supply the Expenses of Water till the Re∣turn
of another <HI>Comet.</HI> But we so sel∣dom
receive Visits from these <HI>Celestial</HI> Bo∣dies,
and we are so little sensible of the
difference of the Quantity of Water fal∣ling
then and at other times; and these
<HI>Comets</HI> are when they come within our
Regions at so great a distance from us,
that no such considerable Effects as may
answer our Demands are, I fear, to be
expected from 'em. Besides, the Wis∣dom
of Nature generally supplies re∣gular
<HI>Deficiencies</HI> by regular and uniform
<PB N="51" REF="202"/>
Causes and tho' the decrease of fluidity
on this our Globe may not be ev'ry Year
of the same Quantity exactly, yet it seems
to be more constant and regular than the
returns of these <HI>Comets;</HI> but of this we
shall have Occasion to discourse at more
length in the following Chapter. Where∣fore,
since it's certain that the Quantity
of Water on our Globe does daily de∣crease
(tho' perhaps not sensibly) had the
World <HI>Eternally been,</HI> the whole Face of
this Earth had been more parch'd than
the Defarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> which not being
so, it is plain this present State of things
has not been from all Eternity.</P>
<P>§ XIX. It has been prov'd likewise in
the preceding Chapter, that the <HI>Light</HI>
of the <HI>Sun</HI> does daily decrease, and that
the Body of the Sun does continually grow
cooler; the same may be said of the <HI>fixt
Stars:</HI> Now had the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI>
been from all Eternity, we shou'd have
been reduc'd long before this time to a
State of utter Darkness. We are very cer∣tain
that the Rays of the Sun are impri∣soned
<PB N="52" REF="203"/>
in our Plants and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in our
<HI>Metals</HI> and <HI>Minerals,</HI> and are retain'd by
the Action of Bodies upon Light; and
some part of them by their separation
from others, and their being imprison'd
in these Substances, and the Action of
Bodies upon Light, are for ever hinder'd
from returning to the Body of the <HI>Sun.</HI>
We are certain likewise that the Foun∣tain
of our Heat daily impairs, that the
vast Body of the <HI>Sun</HI> is perpetually a-cool∣ing,
and tho' these Effects be not so con∣siderable
as to become sensible in three
or four thousand Years (tho' if ancient Hi∣stories
be true, this abatement and diminu∣tion
of the Light and Heat has not been in∣sensible)
yet in an infinity of Ages (this di∣minution
being still somewhat) the Sun
had been redu'd to the Heat and Light of
a Candle long 'ere this time; and we had
been involv'd in a more than <HI>Cimmerian</HI>
darkness. But since we observe no such
Effect as this, it is plain the World has
not lasted from all Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="204"/>
§ XX. But that which does infallibly
demonstrate that this present state of
things, both had a beginning and that of
themselves they must have an end, is,
that our <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Planets,</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> and
<HI>fixt Stars</HI> do not move in Spaces altoge∣ther
void. But in such that do make at
least some resistance to their Motions;
I have shewn in the preceding Chapter,
that the Reason why, for example, the
<HI>Planets</HI> move about the <HI>Sun</HI> is that the
Body of the <HI>Sun</HI> attracts these <HI>Planets,</HI>
and likewise these <HI>Planets</HI> attract the <HI>Sun,</HI>
and that (since the <HI>Planets</HI> describe <HI>Ellip∣tick</HI>
Orbits about the <HI>Sun</HI>) the attractive
Force of the Sun upon the Planets is <HI>reci∣procally,</HI>
as the <HI>Squares</HI> of the different di∣stances
of the <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbit from the <HI>Suns</HI>
Center in its <HI>focus.</HI> But that besides,
these <HI>Planets</HI> were driven at first, or at
the beginning of their Motion (to speak
so) by a Force whose direction made an
Angle with the attractive Force; or that
at the very same time the attractive Force
of the Sun exerted itself on these <HI>Planets</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="205"/>
they were push'd along in right Lines by
a Force whose direction was in some man∣ner
or other inclin'd to that of the directi∣on
of the attractive Force of the Sun, o∣therwise
they cou'd never have revolv'd
in Orbits. So that it's evident the Mo∣tion
of the <HI>Planets</HI> about the Sun, is com∣pounded
of two different Motions in two
different Directions, either of which be∣ing
destroy'd the Planets must have
fall'n into the <HI>Sun,</HI> or stray'd for ever in
right Lines; and tho' the resistence of the
<HI>Medium</HI> cannot alter the <HI>Centripetal</HI> Moti∣on,
(so I call that whereby the Planet
tends towards the Sun) yet if there be
any resistence in the <HI>Medium</HI> through
which the Planets pass, the <HI>projectil</HI> Moti∣on,
(so I call the other) must decrease
and (in an infinity of Ages) be destroy∣ed.
Now tho' Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has consider∣ed
the resistence arising from the <HI>Expan∣sion</HI>
of the <HI>Elastick Atmospheres</HI> of the <HI>Pla∣nets,</HI>
and cannot say it is absolutely no∣thing,
(for he only finds that it's not suf∣ficient
to destroy the <HI>projectil</HI> Motion in
<PB N="55" REF="206"/>
a very short time,) yet he has not men∣tioned
that arising from the fluid of <HI>Light</HI>
which reaches beyond the Orbit of <HI>Saturn,</HI>
and tho' we have shewn in the preceding
Chapter, that this fluid is extreamly thin
and its parts easily moveable, yet still they
make a fluid; and this fluid must give
some resistence to Bodies passing through
it, which tho' very small, must in an in∣finity
of Ages have been sufficient to have
quite destroyed this <HI>projectil</HI> Motion. If
the Light of the Sun be a Body (as we
have prov'd it to be) it must resist other
Bodies that move in it, and if it be but
the <HI>Action</HI> of lucid Bodies communicated
by the impulse of one Body upon another,
in a strait Line, without the <HI>actual</HI> Motion
of any one of 'em, yet still it is necessary
that there be a <HI>Series</HI> of Bodies interpos'd
betwixt the lucid Body and the illumina∣ted
Object, which will as much resist the
passage of Bodies, as if the parts of Light
mov'd themselves; so that in both Cases
there must be some resistence made to Bo∣dies
passing through this Ocean of Light;
<PB N="56" REF="207"/>
which tho' not sensible in any finite time,
must have been sufficient in an infinity of
Ages to have destroy'd the <HI>projectil</HI> Moti∣on,
and consequently long e're now all the
<HI>Planets</HI> had been broiling in the Sun, had
the World lasted from all Eternity; which
not having happened, it's plain this pre∣sent
state of things has not lasted from all
Eternity in the Order we now behold
it.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Since it has been sufficiently
demonstrated in the preceding Chapter,
that Motion is not essential to Matter,
that no particle thereof nor any <HI>Combina∣tions</HI>
of particles can bring themselves to
Motion, and since there are various and
different Motions observable in this pre∣sent
state of things, it's evident that the
Matter or Bodies of this Universe has
been some time or other before this present
time put in Motion, but more especial∣ly
since no Body put in or ev'n endow'd
with Motion, can of itself revolve in an
Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI> Line, <HI>per Coroll.</HI> 3. of
the first <HI>Law of Nature;</HI> and since we see
<PB N="57" REF="208"/>
the <HI>Celestial</HI> Bodies do move in <HI>curve</HI> Lines
it's plain they have not for ever mov'd of
themselves, and consequently they have
not for ever existed in the state we behold
'em. It is altogether impossible for any
Body to move in an Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI>
Line of itself, because at every different
point it must change its direction; and to
suppose a Body capable of changing its
direction at every different point of its
Course, is to suppose it to have Reason
and Discretion. And since to move in an
Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI> Line is to move with
a Motion compounded of two other Mo∣tions,
one of which at least must have
been impress'd, since it cannot move of
itself by both, by the <HI>Corollary</HI> now men∣tioned.
Therefore before the one of
these Motions was impress'd, it was in a
different state from what it, was in, after
that other Motion was impress'd. So that
since the <HI>Planets</HI> do revolve in Orbits or
<HI>curve</HI> Lines, it is plain they have, not for
ever been in the state we now behold
'em of themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="209"/>
§ XXII. If the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> be not actu∣ally
infinite in their Number, then this
present state of things must of necessity
both have had a beginning and must have
an end. It's certain these luminous Bo∣dies
do mutually <HI>attract</HI> each other, since
it's absurd to imagine Matter not to be
of the same uniform Nature every where;
and it's as certain they do not revolve
about any common Center or Centers,
since they have been observ'd never to
have varied their situations or distances
from each other. Now if they be finite
in Number, the terminating Bodies of the
material part of the World must be all
free from Attractions towards the void
part, and so must be all approaching to∣ward
the <HI>common Center of Gravity</HI> of the
whole; and had the Frame of the World
been eternal, they had long e're now all
of 'em met there. <HI>Space</HI> indeed may
be infinite in its extent, but there is no
imaginable Reason to believe the Number
of the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> is infinite, nor the material
part of the Universe boundless, since we
<PB N="59" REF="210"/>
have very good Reason to believe that
the solid Substance has a very small Propor∣tion
to the Vacuities interspersed even in our
<HI>System,</HI> and the Matter of this Universe is
almost nothing in respect of the contain∣ing
Space, as has been insinuated in the
former Chapter. For since Space is infi∣nite
(as I shall hereafter demonstrate) and
since there's a necessity of admitting of
actual Vacuities as I have formerly shewn;
it's plain, Matter cannot be infinite in its
extent, since thereby it is not equal to
<HI>Space.</HI> Now if the fixt Stars be finite in
their Number, or the material part of this
Universe limited in its extent, the Bodies
at the limits of the material part being
quite free from attractions upon the side
toward the infinite Space, must yield to
the attracting Force of the Bodies toward
the <HI>common Center of Gravity</HI> of the mate∣rial
part, and the <HI>Boundaries</HI> yielding, the
Bodies next them must do so likewise, and
so on ev'n to the Center; for nothing but
an equal attraction on all Hands can keep
the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> constant in their Places, and
<PB N="60" REF="211"/>
nothing but an infinite Number rang'd up
and down the infinite Space can be suffi∣cient
for this; wherefore since it has been
evidently demonstrated that the material
part of this Universe is finite in its extent.
If the World had lasted from all Eterni∣ty
the whole Matter of this Universe had
been long before this time amass'd in the
<HI>common Center of Gravity,</HI> and had there
made a lifeless Heap; which not having
happened it's plain this World has not la∣sted
from all Eternity, nor can of itself
continue to all Eternity. And it's not un∣likely
that the vast if not immense distan∣ces
of the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> from us and one ano∣ther,
has been design'd to retard this Effect
as long as the designs of Providence may
require.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. In the former part of this
<HI>Chapter</HI> I have demonstrated the impossi∣bility
of the <HI>Mechanical</HI> production of <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and I shall have Oc∣casion
in the following <HI>Chapter</HI> to make it
evident, that ev'ry generated <HI>Animal</HI> is
produc'd from a preexistent <HI>Animalcul</HI> of
<PB N="61" REF="212"/>
the same <HI>Species,</HI> and that ev'ry <HI>Vegetable</HI>
arises from a small Plant of the same kind.
And it is impossible it can be otherwise
upon our Adversary's <HI>Scheme</HI> of admitting
nothing but Matter and Motion, for if
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> cannot be produc'd
from these, (and I have clearly prov'd
they cannot) they must of necessity have
been from all Eternity. And consequent∣ly
that all the <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that
have existed or shall exist, have actually
been all included in the first of ev'ry <HI>Spe∣cies;</HI>
or which is the same thing, that
pitching upon any one <HI>individual</HI> of ei∣ther
kind now existent, that all the <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
or <HI>Vegetables</HI> that proceed from it
were included in it, and it, with all these
was included in that one from which it
proceeded, and so on infinitely backwards;
and consequently since there is no new
production, all that are or ever have been
of that <HI>Species</HI> were once actually together
included in one infinitely remote from
this now pitch'd upon. And that at any
finitely or infinitely distant time (if they
<PB N="62" REF="213"/>
have so long existed) from their Genera∣tion
or Production, all the <HI>Animals</HI> in∣cluded
in the first of ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> were
there moving and living <HI>Animalculs,</HI> and
all <HI>Vegetables</HI> included in the first of ev'ry
Kind, were there actually growing and
encreasing small Plants. Now since every
<HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> has been prov'd to
consist of <HI>Organs</HI> in Number infinite (tho'
if the Organs of <HI>Animals</HI> be only finite
in Number, it will as effectually serve our
present purpose.) It is absolutely impossi∣ble
any of the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> or <HI>Vege∣tables</HI>
shou'd have existed from all Eterni∣ty;
for then their Number must have
been infinitely many, and the <HI>Animalculs</HI>
and small Plants, being <HI>Organical</HI> Bodies
and consisting of parts, and those infinite∣ly
many too, and being all included in
the first of every <HI>Species,</HI> or those infi∣nitely
distant from the present <HI>Individu∣als,</HI>
these first ones of ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> must
of necessity have been infinitely big, for
infinitely many <HI>Organical</HI> Bodies how
small soever, amass'd together in one Bo∣dy,
<PB N="63" REF="214"/>
must make that Body infinitely big;
so that unless we cou'd admit the first of
ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> to
be infinitely big (and how absurd such an
<HI>Hypothesis</HI> is, I leave the Reader to judge)
It is absolutely impossible, that <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> shou'd have been from all
Eternity; neither can I see how this Ar∣gument
can be evaded, if we admit all
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> to proceed from
preexistent small <HI>Individuals</HI> of the same
Species, included in the first of each kind.
And it is impossible this can be otherwise
upon our Adversaries Scheme, if the <HI>Me∣chanical</HI>
Production of these be impossible,
which I think I have clearly demon∣strated.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Had the World lasted from
<HI>all Eternity</HI> as it now is, it is altogether
impossible but that <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences</HI>
must have been brought to a far greater
Perfection than they have as yet attain'd.
Let us take for Instance the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI>
it is certain this Science has been more im∣prov'd
within these two hundred Years, than
<PB N="64" REF="215"/>
in all the time past before that, since we have
any Records; and two or three hundred
Years more, going on at the rate of
those last past, may carry 'em to a height
which we now cannot imagine. Now it
is altogether impossible the Improvements
already made shou'd be lost, seeing they
contain things so absolutely necessary to
the <HI>Accommodation</HI> of Mankind; they will as
soon forget the use of Houses and Cloaths,
as the Advantages to be reap'd from this
<HI>Science;</HI> wherefore had the World Eter∣nally
been, this Science had been brought
to its utmost Perfection long e'er now.
It may be alleged that <HI>Inundations, Delu∣ges,
Wars</HI> and <HI>Pestilencies</HI> might have de∣stroyed
all the former Emprovements, and
then we shou'd have been left to begin a∣new.
As for <HI>Deluges,</HI> it is impossible they
shou'd have been Universal, <HI>i. e.</HI> Natu∣rally
and Mechanically impossible; for
the only <HI>Philosophical</HI> Account of an <HI>Uni∣versal
Deluge</HI> hitherto assign'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that
of Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s, depends entirely upon
the Principles of Gravitation, which have
<PB N="65" REF="216"/>
been proved not to be <HI>Mechanical;</HI> and
since there cou'd be no <HI>Universal Deluge</HI>
naturally, (and to allow a Principle above
Nature or the established Laws of <HI>Mecha∣nism,</HI>
is to yield the Cause) particular In∣undations,
cou'd never have been sufficient
to have obliterated the remains of Scien∣ces,
particularly of this one, which by In∣scriptions
on <HI>Medals,</HI> by the Ruins of
<HI>Architecture,</HI> by <HI>Pillars, Instruments,</HI> and
<HI>Machins,</HI> might have been preserv'd in de∣spite
of every thing but an Universal Con∣flagration.
Besides, it's meerly precarious,
to say there have been Deluges that have
done any considerable Damage, to the
whole rational Creation, and may be de∣ny'd
with the same Reason it is affirm'd,
since it is certain we have heard of none
of any considerable Consequence. It's true
there happen'd an <HI>Universal Deluge</HI> in
<HI>Noah's</HI> Days; but besides, as I formerly said,
that this was not brought about naturally,
we know not, if this and other Sciences, had
arriv'd at any great Perfection before this
Deluge happen'd. So that we are not
<PB N="66" REF="217"/>
certain if the Perfection of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sci∣ences</HI>
has been much retarded upon this
account. Wars and Pestilences, it's true,
have been and may be, but those do not
happen universally over the whole World
at the same time; and there are always
some Countries and many particular Per∣sons
who escape; so that is impossible these
things cou'd have obliterated all the Re∣mains
of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI> I believe it
almost impossible by any means, except
<HI>Annihilation,</HI> or a general Conflagration,
so to deface the Memory and Remains of
all our modern Improvements, that some
of 'em shou'd not last at least ten thousand
Years to come; and yet it's certain we have
no evident Footsteps of Improvements ol∣der
than three or four thousand Years. In
short, this Argument holds good against
ev'ry thing but <HI>Universal Deluges;</HI> and to
admit or suppose any such to have been,
is to yield the Cause, since it's impossible
to explain such by the Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI>
or to account for them by Matter and Mo∣tion
as things are now settled; and to
<PB N="67" REF="218"/>
quit these, or to allow any thing to have
happen'd contrary to them, is to admit
<HI>Powers</HI> superiour to 'em, which for ought
we know might have produc'd that which
they can now so powerfully alter. And
tho' <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences</HI> may have been at
a stand for many Ages in some Countries,
yet that is nothing to the whole Globe.
For since that Principle which prompts some
Men to improve <HI>Arts</HI> or <HI>Sciences</HI> they are
inclin'd to, springs naturally in their Minds,
according to the <HI>Scheme</HI> of our Adversa∣ries,
and is neither imprinted upon them,
nor were the things themselves reveal'd to
them, by any superiour Beings; this Prin∣ciple
in an infinity of Ages, without any
<HI>Universal Deluge,</HI> or ev'n any particular
one of any great extent, must have of
Necessity brought Arts and Sciences, and
the other Accommodations of Life,
to a much greater Perfection than we see
they have now attain'd. From all which
duly weigh'd, it's plain this World has
not Eternally been as it is now. And
indeed, the Accounts of our Emprove∣ments
<PB N="68" REF="219"/>
answer very well to the time, as∣sign'd
by <HI>Moses</HI> for the Creation of the
World.</P>
<P>§ XXV. If the Number of any <HI>genera∣ted</HI>
thing, which we behold on this Globe,
does either encrease or diminish continu∣ally,
in any finite Number of Years how
great soever, by any finite Number how
small soever, then this World cou'd not
have been from all Eternity in the present
state we now behold it. For had it en∣creas'd
in any finite Number of Years how
great soever, by any Number how small
soever, long before this time their Num∣ber
had been infinite; so that this poor
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Hill</HI> of a <HI>Globe</HI> had not been able
to contain 'em: And had they decreas'd,
their Number had been none at all, <HI>i. e.</HI>
the whole Race had been extinguished.
But since neither of these has happened,
it's plain the present state of things has
not been for ever. It's not easie to be∣lieve
for instance, that the Race of Man∣kind,
has been <HI>ebbing</HI> and <HI>flowing</HI> without
considerable encreases or diminutions, from
<PB N="69" REF="220"/>
all Eternity. We are certain <HI>Wars, Pesti∣lences</HI>
and <HI>Diseases,</HI> and the other means
of Destruction, have not been fewer for
these 300 Years by-past; than ever they have
been since we have Records, and yet it's plain
the Number of Mankind has considerably
encreased in that time. Sir <HI>William Pet∣ty</HI>
from Observations on Birth's and Buri∣als
has discovered that in 360 Years the,
Mass of Mankind is doubled in these Coun∣tries.
Had they thus encreas'd from all E∣ternity
in other Countries, all the <HI>Planets</HI>
within our <HI>System</HI> had not been able to
have contain'd them by this time; yea if
in many <HI>millions</HI> of Years they had but
encreas'd by an Unity continually, their
Number had been infinite by this time.
But it's plain both the Number of Man∣kind,
and that of other <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vege∣tables,</HI>
must have perpetually encreas'd, if
the World has been from all Eternity as it
is at present And since their Number is
but finite at present, it's evident this
World has not been for ever as now it is.
And indeed the present Number of Ani∣mals
<PB N="70" REF="221"/>
does answer very well to the com∣mon
<HI>Aera</HI> of the Creation. These two
last Arguments I have subjoin'd, not as
conclusive proofs of the Production of this
present Universe in time, but as concur∣ring
Confirmations of the former Demon∣strations.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Lastly, How improbable is
it that this World shou'd have been from
all Eternity? Is there any thing we see
in any part of it, or ev'n in the whole,
that has any other Quality suitable to that
<HI>Cardinal</HI> one of Self-existence? We our
selves are certainly the noblest part of
this <HI>System</HI> we are acquainted with; and
yet God knows how unfit any of us, or
even our whole Race is, to have so ex∣travagant
a Compliment bestow'd upon us
as Self-existence, when as we can scarce
be said to be at all, so very a nothing our
Lives are in respect of <HI>Infinite Duration.</HI>
We might with as much Reason imagine
Mankind <HI>Omniscient</HI> or <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> (which
we know too well he is not) as <HI>self-exi∣stent.</HI>
These qualities cannot be separated;
<PB N="71" REF="222"/>
where one is, all the rest must necessarily
be. For whosoever is <HI>self-existent,</HI> must ne∣cessarily
and independently be. <HI>Necessarily,</HI>
because depending only on himself alone
for Being, he may be when and while he
pleases; independently, because his Being
and all that's necessary to it depend on
himself alone. And whatever necessarily
and independently exists, must Be in Op∣position
of all other Powers, and whoe∣ver
is so, must be able to preserve his Be∣ing
in despite of all other Powers, <HI>i. e.</HI>
must be <HI>Omnipotent.</HI> Whoever is <HI>Omnipo∣tent</HI>
must know all things that are possible
to be done or let alone; for he can never
be supos'd to do that which he knows not
how to do, <HI>i. e.</HI> must be <HI>Omniscient;</HI> and
whoever is <HI>Omnipotent</HI> and <HI>Omniscient,</HI> all
things else must depend on him; for be∣ing
so, he may make all things depend of
him if already they did not so. Besides,
other things must depend of him for the
very same Reason, <HI>viz.</HI> because he can
make'em do so. As also, whatever is <HI>Omni∣potent</HI>
and <HI>Omniscient,</HI> depending on no∣things
<PB N="72" REF="223"/>
and having all things depending on
him, must be supremely good and wise;
because he knows all things, can do all
things, has no Reason nor Cause to de∣termine
him to any thing that's bad, since
nothing can hurt him, nor any Power annoy
him. So that it's very plain, that whatever
is <HI>self-existent</HI> must possess all the other sui∣table
Qualifications. And since we must of
necessity admit something to be self-exi∣stent,
how much more reasonable is it, to
believe that, that <HI>immense Being,</HI> which pos∣sesses
all other Qualities suitable to that of
<HI>Self-Existence,</HI> has been from all Eternity;
and when it was his Pleasure, has created
this noble Representation of himself, <HI>viz.</HI>
This beautiful State of things, which bears
so visible <HI>Characters</HI> of his infinite Power
and Wisdom, as shall abundantly be
shewn hereafter. And this is the <HI>third
Opinion</HI> about the <HI>Origination</HI> of the Uni∣verse,
which must of necessity be true,
since after the other two, which I have
(I think) abundantly confuted, this is the
only possible remaining Choice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Existence of a Deity.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THAT there are no <HI>Speculative
Atheists,</HI> to me seems as evident,
as, that no Body who has considered the
matter, can be absolutely convinc'd, that
the three <HI>Angles</HI> of a <HI>Triangle</HI> are not equal
to two <HI>right ones.</HI> The <HI>Fool</HI> indeed may
have said in his Heart there is no God, <HI>i. e.</HI>
lewd and vicious Men, may have hear∣tily
wish'd within themselves, that there
were no secret Observer, nor that there
<PB N="74" REF="225"/>
might be any publick <HI>Punishment</HI> of their
Crimes, because it's their Interest there
should be neither; but that a Man of an
ordinary Understanding, who has seri∣ously
set about the matter, and has du∣ly
weigh'd the Evidences for the <HI>Being of
a Deity,</HI> should at last come to a full Per∣suasion
of his <HI>None-Existence,</HI> to me seems
as impossible, as it is for one who has
attentively read the <HI>first Book of Euclid,</HI>
and rightly uuderstood what he has read,
to be convinc'd that the Sum of the <HI>An∣gles</HI>
of a <HI>right lin'd Triangle,</HI> can be more
or less than two <HI>right Angles.</HI> It is true
most Men think nothing of the matter;
and few give themselves the Trouble to
inquire whether there be a God or not;
they think such idle <HI>Speculations</HI> become
those only, who know not to live, and
to make the best use of Life that may
be. And of this kind of <HI>Atheists</HI> there
is abundance in the World; for it's cer∣tain
we can never determine any thing a∣bout
what we never, or but very <HI>slight∣ly</HI>
think of; and there are millions who
<PB N="75" REF="226"/>
live and dye ignorant of many Self-evi∣dent
Truths, because they never took the
Pains to consider them. But the being
or not being of a Deity, is a Matter of
that Moment to the Government of the
World, the necessary Consequences there∣of,
do so nearly concern the Happiness
or Misery of every <HI>individual rational
Creature;</HI> and the Objects that inculcate
the Consideration of it, are so many, so
different, and so <HI>conspicuous,</HI> that none
but the wilfully blind, can withstand such
convincing Testimonies. Now tho' the
the <HI>Demonstration</HI> of this <HI>great Truth, viz.</HI>
that there is a <HI>supreme Being,</HI> who made
and governs this present <HI>System</HI> of things,
has employ'd the Care of many <HI>wise</HI> and
<HI>good</HI> Men, so that none can doubt of it
for want of sufficient Proofs, who will
but give themselves leave to consider; yet
since the <HI>Evidences</HI> for it, can never be too
many, and since some are to be wrought
upon by one sort of Argument, others
by another, I shall here fet down those,
which agreed best with my manner of
<PB N="76" REF="227"/>
thinking, which are founded on the <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>
of a, juster. <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and a more
genuine Explication of Nature, than was
known till of late. And I have chosen this
way of reasoning, the rather because our
modern <HI>Atheists</HI> have taken <HI>Sanctuary</HI>
within the Bounds of <HI>Natural Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>§ II. All the Arguments of the <HI>pre∣ceding
Chapter,</HI> are so many, Proofs of
the Existence of a <HI>surpreme Power,</HI> who
made and governs this present <HI>System of
things.</HI> For since this World, cou'd neither
be produc'd by the casual <HI>Concourse</HI> of
<HI>Atoms,</HI> neither cou'd have been from all
<HI>Eternity</HI> of it self, as it has been suffici∣ently
prov'd; and since that it now is, no
Body doubts, of Necessity therefore, it
must have been produc'd or created, some,
time or another, by some preexisting
Power. Now since there is nothing else
in being but <HI>this World,</HI> unless we admit
that <HI>supreme Power</HI> we are now speaking
of; and since it cou'd neither have been
produc'd from the <HI>fortuitous Concourse of
Atoms,</HI> nor have been from all <HI>Eternity</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="228"/>
of <HI>it self;</HI> it must of necessity have been
produc'd by that <HI>supreme Power,</HI> whose
Being we now inquire into. Since then
this <HI>supreme Power,</HI> of necessity, must have
created this beautiful <HI>System</HI> of things,
and since existing independently, He must
for ever be, and have been; therefore
that <HI>great Power,</HI> must necessarily now
exist. All the Difficulty any rational Crea∣ture
can have about the Existence of a
<HI>Deity,</HI> is how to conceive his having for
ever been of himself without a Beginning.
Now if we could avoid this Difficulty, by
saying that this <HI>System</HI> was produc'd, by
the casual meeting of <HI>Atoms,</HI> or by al∣ledging
it to have for ever been of it self,
we might have some slight Pretence for
our <HI>Infidelity.</HI> But since this Difficulty,
does equally lye against all these three
Suppositions, (for if the World has been
produc'd by the <HI>casual Concourse of Atoms,</HI>
then <HI>a Void, Atoms,</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI> have for
ever been, without a Beginning, of 'em∣selves;
if it has been from all Eternity <HI>of
itself,</HI> as it is, then the Case is plain, that
<PB N="78" REF="229"/>
we must allow something to have been
without a beginning <HI>of it self.</HI>) Where∣fore
I say, since the; very same Difficulty
equally and unavoidably, urges all the
three Suppositions; is it not more rea∣fonable
and <HI>congruous,</HI> to allow that Being
to have been for ever of it self, without a
beginning, to whom we may ascribe, and
who does necessarily possess all other sui∣table
Perfections; rather than either of
those others, which we know are nei∣ther
endow'd with, nor capable of, such
eminent and transcendent Qualitys? I
will not say with <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> that be∣cause
in our Conception of a Being <HI>infi∣nitely
perfect,</HI> there must be included <HI>ne∣cessary</HI>
Existence, that therefore such a
Being must of necessity <HI>actually</HI> exist. But
sure I am, since our main Difficulty in
the Conception of the Existence of a be∣ing
<HI>absolutely perfect,</HI> is his necessary Ex∣istence,
or his having for ever been of
himself without a beginning; it is much
more reasonable to suppose that Being to
have for ever been of himself who ne∣cessarily
<PB N="79" REF="230"/>
possesses all other suitable Qua∣lities,
than those who neither possess, nor
are capable of any of them.</P>
<P>§III. The <HI>Existence</HI> of <HI>Matter,</HI> is a
plain <HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>Existence of a
Deity.</HI> I believe no body doubts, that
there now exists a Quantity of <HI>solid Mass,</HI>
out of which the <HI>celestial and terrestrial</HI>
Bodies were form'd; and tho' perhaps in
our most solid Bodies, there be more
Pores than Parts, or more <HI>Vacuity</HI> than
<HI>Solidity,</HI> yet there is still sufficient, not
to permit us to doubt of the Existence of
Matter. Wherefore since Matter now a∣ctually
is, I wou'd gladly learn how
it first existed. It cou'd never have been
of it self, since we are certain, that it
is destitute of all <HI>active</HI> Qualities what∣soever;
it cannot move of <HI>itself,</HI> nor when
put in motion can it rest of <HI>itself,</HI> nor
of <HI>itself</HI> change it's Course, nor alter it's
Direction; it can neither change it's
<HI>Figure,</HI> nor <HI>Colour,</HI> nor <HI>Situation;</HI> in a
word, it is endu d with no Property but Inactivity,
which is but a Negation. How
<PB N="80" REF="231"/>
absurd is it then, to imagine it cou'd have
brought <HI>itself</HI> into Being, when it can
do just nothing <HI>of itself?</HI> We may as rea∣sonably
imagine that <HI>Nonentity,</HI> shou'd
bring itself to become a positive Being,
as conceive it possible that Matter shou'd
of <HI>itself</HI> for ever have been. Besides, ad∣mitting
Matter to have been for ever of
itself, yet this will not solve half the
Difficulties, arising in the Formation and
Production of the present State of things,
as has been shewn in the <HI>preceding Chap∣ter,</HI>
and shall be now farther illustrated,
Whereas the admitting of an <HI>infinitely
Powerful and perfect Being</HI> to have for <HI>e∣ver</HI>
been, and to have created the <HI>solid
Mass,</HI> and out of it, fram'd this wonder∣ful
<HI>System</HI> of Things, contracts all the
Difficulties of Nature into this one of
his <HI>Existence.</HI> For as to the Difficulties of
Creation, they vanish quite, before <HI>infi∣nite</HI>
Power, for Power implies a Capacity
to act, and <HI>infinite</HI> Power a Capacity to
act every thing not involving a Contra∣diction.
Wherefore since Matter now
<PB N="81" REF="232"/>
actually is, and yet it neither cou'd have
been for ever of itself, nor had it for e∣ver
been, wou'd that remove the Difficul∣ties
arising in the Formation of this pre∣sent
<HI>System</HI> of things, but on the contrary
wou'd multiplie 'em. Is it not much more
reasonable then, to admit an infinitely wise
Being to have for ever been <HI>of himself?</HI>
whereby all the Difficulties, in the con∣ceiving
the Manner of the Production of
this <HI>Universe,</HI> do vanish at once.</P>
<P>§ IV. It has been formerly shewn, that
this <HI>Universe</HI> was not form'd by the
same Laws it now is govern'd,, and which
it's several Parts in their Actions do now
obey; and therefore of necessity there
must have been some Power superior
to, and distinct from, that of Matter,
which form'd this <HI>System</HI> at first, and pre∣scrib'd
Laws for it's Parts afterwards to
observe. We see all the Changes that
now happen in this material World, are
according to the Laws established in the
<HI>first Chapter.</HI> But this <HI>System</HI> of Things
cou'd never have been brought into it's
<PB N="82" REF="233"/>
present Order, by the now established
Laws of Nature, (ev'n admitting Matter
to have been <HI>eternally existent of itself</HI>) as
I have abundantly shewn in the <HI>first Chap∣ter;</HI>
neither one, nor all of these Laws
were sufficient to have separated, that
thin and rare fluid of <HI>Light,</HI> from the other
grosser and more dense ones, and amass'd
it in the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars;</HI> neither did
the Laws of specifick Gravities obtain in
the <HI>Formation</HI> and <HI>Situation</HI> of the inner
Parts of our <HI>Earth,</HI> and the other <HI>Planets;</HI>
nor in the <HI>Separation</HI> and <HI>Situation</HI> of the
several Fluids thereof. By none of the
known Laws of Motion, was the <HI>Num∣ber,
Magnitudes,</HI> or Distances of the <HI>fixt
Stars</HI> determin'd, the Figure, Number,
Densities, Gravitations upon one ano∣ther,
Situations and Order of the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
adjusted, the Number, Distances,
and Magnitudes of the <HI>Satellits of Jupi∣ter,</HI>
the Form and bulk of the <HI>Annulus</HI> of
<HI>Saturn</HI> limited. In a word, the whole pro∣cess
of the <HI>Formation</HI> of the <HI>celestial</HI> and
<HI>terrestrial</HI> World, as to their principal
<PB N="83" REF="234"/>
Parts and Arrangements, was brought a∣bout
by none of the Laws of Motion and
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> that now obtain in this set∣tled
state of things; or at most these
Laws had but a small Share in their Pro∣duction.
Wherefore since this beautiful
state of things, has not been for ever <HI>of
itself,</HI> nor cou'd be form'd by the Powers
and Laws of Nature, it is plain it has
been, produc'd by something superiour to
Matter and it's Qualities, and consequent∣ly
by that <HI>supreme</HI> Being, into whose <HI>Ex∣istence</HI>
we are now inquiring. And truly
from what has been here said, and a great
deal more of the same Nature alleg'd in
the <HI>first Chapter,</HI> it is evident, we can
have no Notion of the <HI>Formation</HI> of this
present State of things, other than what
we have of a <HI>Planetary Clock,</HI> or any other
complicated <HI>Machin,</HI> form'd by the Hand
of a skilful <HI>Artist;</HI> where tho' the Rules
of Motion, and Laws of Nature, may
obtain, yet they are directed, and even
sometimes contradicted, by the volunta∣ry
Motions, and the design'd Interposings
<PB N="84" REF="235"/>
of <HI>free Agents.</HI> And tho' this no doubt,
be but a very faint Resemblance of that
<HI>noble</HI> and glorious Work, yet it is the
best and most adequate our <HI>Imaginations,</HI>
without runing upon evident Contradicti∣ons,
can frame.</P>
<P>§ V. As the Formation and Disposition
of the <HI>great Bodies</HI> of this Universe, did
necessarily require the Hand of a Being
infinitely powerful; so likewise did their
first Movement, and impress'd Motions,
demand the Impulse of an almighty Hand,
to set them first a going. For supposing
the <HI>celestial</HI> Bodies already form'd, and
rang'd according to their several Distan∣ces
from one another; yet without this
Impulse, they had continu'd unactive, un∣moving,
Heaps of Matter. Now it has
been already shewn that no Particle of
Matter, nor any <HI>Combination</HI> of Particles,
can move themselves and therefore it
was absolutely necessary that something
different from themselves, shou'd put
them in a motion, with a due Velocity
along the <HI>Tangents</HI> of their several <HI>Orbits;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="236"/>
otherwise they had for ever continued in
the places, and at the Distances, they
were at first set. Wherefore since it is
certain that these <HI>glorious Bodies</HI> have
been rowling about these four or five
thousand Years; and since it hath been
demonstrated that they are not self-mo∣ving,
being <HI>solid Masses of Matter;</HI> since
it has likewise been shewn, that they
have not mov'd from all Eternity <HI>of them∣selves,</HI>
it is plain, that they have been
set a going by some powerful Hand; and
what Hand sufficient for such a Work,
but his who is infinite, both in Strength
and Skill; and consequently he who did
so <HI>great and glorious</HI> things must necessa∣rily
<HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>§ VI. Not only the <HI>Formation,</HI> and
first <HI>impulse</HI> of the great Bodies of this
Universe, along the <HI>Tangents</HI> of their <HI>Or∣bits,</HI>
but their <HI>Centripetal</HI> impulses, where∣by
their Revolutions or <HI>orbicular</HI> Motions
are perform'd, did, and still do, require a
Power beyond that of Matter, and the
Laws of Nature, to the preservation of
<PB N="86" REF="237"/>
their Motion. Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> and after him
Dr. <HI>Gregory,</HI> has demonstrated, that to
the Motion of any of the <HI>Celestial</HI> Bodies in
an <HI>Orbit,</HI> there is necessarily requir'd two
Impulses, one along the <HI>Tangent</HI> of the <HI>Orbit,</HI>
another toward the Center, about which the
Body moves. The first being once impress'd,
does continually persevere, and needs no
more to be renew'd, as is evident from
the first Law of Nature: The second con∣tinually
draws the <HI>celestial</HI> Body from it's
<HI>rectilinear</HI> Motion, and forces it into a
<HI>curvilinear</HI> Orbit, so that it must be re∣peated
ev'ry Minute of time. Now these
<HI>secondary</HI> Impulses arise from that <HI>Uni∣versal
Principle of Attraction,</HI> whereby e∣very
Particle of Matter, and all the Bo∣dies
of this Universe tend toward one a∣nother;
and by which the <HI>Sun</HI> being the
far greatest Body of this our <HI>System</HI> draws
toward him the <HI>Planets,</HI> and they their
own <HI>Satellits;</HI> and without which they
wou'd for ever wander in right Lines.
But it has been demonstrated in <HI>the first
Chapter,</HI> that this Principle whereby the
<PB N="87" REF="238"/>
<HI>Revolutions</HI> of these glorious Bodies are
perform'd, is independent of the Laws of
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> and only accidental (noways
<HI>essential</HI>) to Matter, but implanted there∣in
by some extrinsick Power, and conse∣quently
(since it must be repeated every
Minute) must be perpetuated in it by some
uninterrupted Influence. And seeing there
is nothing in Nature, but Matter and the
Powers thereof, unless we admit that su∣preme
Being for whose Existence we con∣tend,
therefore the Revolutions of the
<HI>celestial</HI> Bodies in their several <HI>Orbits</HI> do
necessarily infer the Existence of a Deity.</P>
<P>§ VII. The <HI>Existence</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> does
necessarily infer the <HI>Existence of a Dei∣ty;</HI>
for it has been demonstrated in the
<HI>former Chapter,</HI> that all Animals are in
their own Natures <HI>perpetua mobilia,</HI> that
they have some Principle above the Pow∣ers
of Matter that governs their Moti∣ons;
it has likewise been shewn, that
every <HI>individual Plant</HI> and <HI>Animal</HI> is a
<HI>Machine</HI> of an infinite Number of Or∣gans;
that no Animal is or can be pro∣duc'd
<PB N="88" REF="239"/>
or generated by the Force of Mat∣ter,
and Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> (that all <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that ever were or
shall be, were all created or formed at once,
shall be afterwards shewn) and that all
these are absolutely unaccountable from
the Laws of Motion, and consequently,
must spring from a principle independent
of, and altogether above the Powers and
Properties of Matter. Now when ever
we forsake the Powers of Matter, and
the Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> we necessarily
must have Recourse, to the <HI>Existence</HI> of
some Power superiour to, and indepen∣dent
of Matter, and all it's Laws and Pro∣perties;
and consequently to that <HI>infinite∣ly
Perfect Being,</HI> into whose Existence we
are now inquiring, since there is nothing
besides Matter and its Properties in the
World, unless we admit the Existence of
that <HI>supreme Being.</HI></P>
<P>§ VIII. The <HI>spontaneous</HI> Motions of
<HI>irrational,</HI> and the voluntary Motions of
<HI>rational</HI> Animals, the <HI>Freedom of Will,</HI>
and Liberty of choosing or refusing in the
<PB N="89" REF="240"/>
latter, and in a word all the <HI>Appearances</HI>
of Nature, which are above the Powers
of <HI>Mechanism</HI> (which are innumerable)
are so many undeniable Proofs of the <HI>Be∣ing</HI>
of a <HI>God.</HI> For since this present <HI>System</HI>
of Things, has not been from all Eternity
<HI>of itself,</HI> and since these are allow'd to
be above the Powers of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> they
must have been produc'd by some Power
Superiour to those of <HI>Mechanism.</HI> But no
Power is sufficient for those, but his <HI>who
alone does great and marvellous things,</HI>
who adjusted all the Parts of this noble
<HI>fabrick</HI> by weight and measure, and there∣fore
he that brought about all these glo∣rious
things, <HI>who alone does Wonders,</HI>
must necessarily <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>§ IX. The Preservation of the <HI>Being</HI>
and Faculties, both of the animate and
inanimate Part of this <HI>System</HI> of things, does
necessarily require the Power, and conse∣quently
the <HI>Existence</HI> of a Being absolute∣ly
perfect, <HI>i. e.</HI> of a Deity. For since this
<HI>System</HI> of things has not been from all E∣ternity
of itself, as we now behold it, and
<PB N="90" REF="241"/>
since there is no necessary Connexion be∣tween
the being of any one Part thereof,
or of it's Faculties, this present Moment,
and their being the next, and since we see
both have been preserv'd for a considera∣ble
time: This preservation of the <HI>Being</HI>
and Faculties of things, can never be ac∣counted
for, without having Recourse
to an <HI>Almighty</HI> Power, which may be suf∣ficient
for all things not involving a Con∣tradiction;
and therefore that <HI>Omnipotent</HI>
Being indow'd with this Power, must ne∣cessarily
<HI>be.</HI> Let us take, for instance,
the Preservation, of a Body moving, in
it's Motion: Ev'ry <HI>motive</HI> Force (as all
other Quantity) may be suppos'd divided
into several Parts (the Sum of all which
must be equal to the <HI>motive</HI> Force first
propos'd.) This motive Force being im∣press'd
on a giv'n Body, must produce a
Motion therein equal to the Motion pro∣duced
by all the several Parts thereof, im∣press'd,
either at once, or at different times.
Now the Motion produc'd by any one
Part of this Motive Force, may be destroy'd
<PB N="91" REF="242"/>
(by the Opposition of an equal Body, im∣pell'd
with a Force equal to that Part of
the Motive Force we wou'd destroy, but
with a contrary Direction) the rest of the
Motion remaining unaltered; therefore
the several Parts of any impress'd Motion
have no <HI>necessary</HI> Dependence upon one
another, since one can be destroyed with∣out
the rest; and consequently the Per∣severation
of a Body in Motion, does not
depend upon the Nature of Body, nor
upon the Nature of Motion, but upon
some Principle <HI>extrinsick</HI> to both, <HI>viz.</HI>
that first Law of Nature (prescrib'd by
the Author thereof) whereby Bodies as
much as in them is, persevere in that
state of Motion or rest they are put in,
unless forced to change the same by some
<HI>foreign</HI> impress'd Violence. Moreover,
Motion may be considered, as the <HI>Trans∣lation</HI>
of a Body from one place into a∣nother.
Now there is no imaginable con∣nexion
between a Bodies being in this
place now, and in another hereafter; and
therefore the Perseveration of a Body
<PB N="92" REF="243"/>
in motion, is not all <HI>essential</HI> to it. Last∣ly,
since an impress'd Force is not at
all permanent in the Body mov'd, but
consists in the meer <HI>Action,</HI> and it's Ef∣ficacy
is spent that very Moment it is
impress'd; it is evident therefore, that
the Perseveration of a Body in motion, is
neither owing to the motive Force, nor
to the Body mov'd. But to that <HI>vis in∣erciae,</HI>
which is implanted therein by some∣thing
distinct from Matter and its essenti∣al
Properties, <HI>i. e.</HI> to <HI>God Almighty,</HI> the
Author of Nature and all its Productions.
After the same manner in the descent of
heavy Bodies the <HI>Acceleration</HI> of their Mo∣tion
may be resembled (or is <HI>equivalent</HI>)
to the <HI>Acceleration</HI> of a Body impelled by
a constant equable Force, acting ev'ry
Minute equally, and by that means ad∣ding
a new Velocity to the former. Now,
any one, or any Number of these Impul∣ses
may be destroyed without the rest;
and therefore the several Impulses, by
which heavy Bodies descend, do not de∣pend
upon one another, since by contra∣ry
<PB N="93" REF="244"/>
equal Impulses they may be destroyed,
and consequently the Degrees of the <HI>Ac∣celeration</HI>
of the Motion of heavy Bodies
descending, have no necessary Connexion
one upon another, and so the Preservation
of this Faculty of Attraction in Matter
which is the Cause thereof does not depend
upon Matter, and therefore must be ascri∣bed
to a higher Power. And the same may
be said of the Being of, (and of all the Fa∣culties
not essential to) Bodies; for the Be∣ing
of any thing now, does by no Means
infer it's being the next Minute, unless the
thing be <HI>self-existent</HI> (which cannot be true
of Matter, nor of any of it's Faculties, as
has been formerly shewn) or unless Time
or Place cou'd change the Natures of
things, which is absur'd. And universally,
whatever is not essential to a thing, that
thing can be without; whatever any thing
can be without, the Continuation of that
is not owing to it, (I mean of inanimate
things) <HI>i. e.</HI> to it's Nature, and conse∣quently
requires some Power above it, for
the Cause of it's Continuation, there, be∣ing
<PB N="94" REF="245"/>
no necessary Connexion betwixt Time
or Place, and the Being or Faculties of
Things; and consequently their Preserva∣tion
is owing to some Power above those
of Matter, <HI>i. e. to him in whom we live,
move, and have our Being.</HI></P>
<P>§ X. But that Argument for the <HI>Ex∣istence</HI>
of a <HI>Being infinitely perfect,</HI> who
made and governs this <HI>System</HI> of things,
which of all others affects me most, is
that it is altogether impossible, this Uni∣verse
cou'd have been better contriv'd or
more compleatly finished, than it is, had
<HI>infinite Wisdom</HI> first actually design'd it,
and then put the Design in execution. Or
which is the same, there are legible and
indelible <HI>Characters</HI> of <HI>infinite Wisdom,</HI> in
the <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the whole, and of the
several Parts of this admirable Fabrick of
the <HI>Universe;</HI> and it is altogether impos∣sible
for the united skill of Men and An∣gels,
to mend any one Part, or to con∣trive
it better, or even to find out any
real Defect therein, due Regard being
had to the universal Benefit of the whole
<PB N="95" REF="246"/>
<HI>System;</HI> for in the Contrivance and Ad∣justment
of the several Parts of this no∣ble
Machin, where the Choice is various,
and sometimes infinite, that one is pitch'd
upon, which alone cou'd bring, the most
advantages to the whole, or which
only cou'd bring about the design'd Ef∣fect.
This is a very large Subject, and
to treat it according to it's Dignity re∣quires
more Room, than the Limits I
have prescrib'd to my self will admit.
However, I shall endeavour to illustrate
the same in the following Particulars. But
first of all it will be convenient to lay
down a general <HI>Scheme</HI> of this noble Stru∣cture.</P>
<P>§ XI. Let us then conceive the <HI>Mun∣dan
Space,</HI> or the universal Place of all
Bodies, to be boundless in it's Extent, or
indefinite in its Dimensions, and in it at
vast Distances from one another, the fixt
Stars (huge luminous Bodies, like the Sun)
to be plac'd, keeping always the same
Distances from one another, and moving
only (perhaps) about their own <HI>Axes;</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="247"/>
about each of these let us imagine se∣veral
Bodies like our <HI>Planets;</HI> rowling in
several <HI>Orbits</HI> at several Distances; and
about those lesser ones <HI>Analogous</HI> to the
<HI>Satellits</HI> of our <HI>Planets.</HI> Each of these
fixt Stars with their Circumambient <HI>Pla∣net-like
Orbs,</HI> constituting that which is
call'd a <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Celestial</HI> Bodies. And
how many such there, must be in the vast
Extent of Space, a naked eye in a cloud∣less
Night, may give us some faint <HI>Glimps,</HI>
but much more a good large <HI>Telescope</HI> di∣rected
toward that Region of the Skie,
which is call'd the <HI>milky way.</HI> Our Num∣bers
fall very short here, and our <HI>Arithme∣tick</HI>
can scarce give us an <HI>idea</HI> of the
vast Quantity of <HI>Systems</HI> that adorn this
<HI>stupenduous</HI> Piece of <HI>Architecture;</HI> and yet
no doubt their Number is finit, and they
are all included in a bounded Extension;
for Matter seems not capable in it's Na∣ture
of being infinitely propagated. More∣over,
let us conceive the glorious Body
of the Sun, fixt in the Center of Gravity
(or near it) of this our <HI>System</HI> and in the
<PB N="97" REF="248"/>
common Center of Motion (or <HI>focus</HI>) of
all the <HI>Planetary Orbits.</HI> And then next
to him <HI>Mercury</HI> makes his <HI>oval round,</HI>
but so near him, that we can rarely ob∣tain
a distinct View of him, he being
swallow'd up almost, in the Light of the
<HI>Sun.</HI> Next to <HI>Mercury,</HI> is our beautiful
Morning and Evening Star <HI>Venus:</HI> next
<HI>Venus,</HI> our <HI>Earth,</HI> with it's Attendant the
<HI>Moon,</HI> perform their friendly Course, and
measure out the Year. Beyond our <HI>Earth
Mars</HI> singly and alone, revolves about the
same Center; next to <HI>Mars, Jupiter,</HI> the
largest of the <HI>Planets,</HI> with his four <HI>Satel∣lits</HI>
turn round in concert; and last
of all, <HI>Saturn</HI> with his five Guards, and
his surrounding <HI>Annulus</HI> or <HI>Ring,</HI> describes
the remotest <HI>Orbit,</HI> and concludes our
<HI>System.</HI></P>
<P>§ XII. For the ease of the Reader, in
going through the following Parts of this
Discourse, I shall set down here the Num∣bers
that, represent the <HI>Periods,</HI> the <HI>Dia∣meters,
Distances, Gravities,</HI> and Quantities
of Matter, in those of the <HI>Celestial</HI> Bodies,

the same, as Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> has

<P>§ XIII. What a <HI>beautiful Scene</HI> of things
have we here? How simple, and yet
how wonderful are the Works of Nature?
Such like are all the Effects of infinite
Wisdom, her Foundations are plain and
simple, but her <HI>superstructure,</HI> various and
wonderful. Her Causes few, her Effects
innumerable. Her Course the easiest and
shortest Possible, and her Means the sewest
<PB N="103" REF="254"/>
that can possibly bring about her Ends.
Let us. but consult the Books of the old
<HI>Astronomers,</HI> and we will then have suffici∣ent
Ground to admire the frugal Simplicity
of Nature, in this neat, compact <HI>System;</HI>
we shall see there what sorry, perplext
Work they made, with their <HI>Cycles,</HI> and
<HI>Epicycles,</HI> their <HI>carrying,</HI> and <HI>aequating,</HI>
their <HI>Concentrick</HI> and <HI>Excentrick</HI> Circles,
the <HI>Stations</HI> and <HI>Retrogadations,</HI> their solid
<HI>Orbs,</HI> and the perpetual Change of the
<HI>Axe</HI> of Motion, in the celestial Ap∣pearances:
such a strange <HI>ungeometrical</HI>
and contradictory <HI>System</HI> they made of
the <HI>Heavens;</HI> whereas from these few
plain and simple Positions, all the Ap∣pearances
of the <HI>Heavens,</HI> are accounted
for, with wonderful Consistency and Fa∣cility.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The <HI>Sun</HI> being a huge Body
of <HI>liquid Fire,</HI> brought into fusion by the
Force of his Heat, and thereby sending
out <HI>Oceans</HI> of that thin, active Fluid,
which is the <HI>Medium</HI> of Light, and the
Cause of all Heat, turns round his own
<PB N="104" REF="255"/>
<HI>Axe,</HI> from West to East in about twenty
five Days; which arises from his first Being
put into such a <HI>Circumgyration,</HI> after his
having been seated in his Place. And
there being little or no Resistance in his
Region to retard his Motion, it has con∣tinu'd
ever since, and will do, till the
<HI>Consummation</HI> of all things; by Virtue of
that first impress'd <HI>Gyration,</HI> and the first
Law of Nature. His Motion about his
own <HI>Axe,</HI> has been discovered by <HI>Spots</HI>
on his Surface, and his Fluidity, from
his lesser Density in respect of some of
the solid <HI>Planets,</HI> (some solid Bodies
being more dense than any Fluid can
be) his <HI>Sphaericity,</HI> and that all Bodies
heated to such a Degree, as the <HI>Sun</HI>
must necessarily be, must certainly be <HI>vi∣trify'd.</HI>
His greater Quantity of Matter,
and larger Dimensions in respect of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> makes him sufficient for all the
Expenses of Light, he lays out upon them,
whereby his Bulk and Heat is constantly
diminishing, as also, for drawing all the
rest of the <HI>Planets</HI> and their <HI>Satellits</HI> to∣wards
<PB N="105" REF="256"/>
him; for as has been formerly insi∣nuated,
the Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> of one Bo∣dy
upon several others, at the same Di∣stance,
is as their <HI>Masses,</HI> or Quantities
of Matter: Wherefore seeing the <HI>Sun</HI> con∣tains
a greater Quantity of Matter by
very far, than any of the <HI>Planets,</HI> the Sun
must necessarily draw the <HI>Planets</HI> with
their <HI>Satellits</HI> to him; which wou'd have
unavoidably come to pass, had not the
<HI>Planets</HI> at the instant they were seated in
their Places, receiv'd an impulse, which
drove 'em along the <HI>Tangents</HI> of their <HI>Or∣bits;</HI>
this with the small Resistance they
meet in their Courses, and the Force of
the Attraction diminishing as the Squares
of their Distances increase, <HI>reciprocally,</HI>
has made 'em ever since revolve in their
<HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI> in one of whose <HI>Foci</HI> the
<HI>Sun</HI> is situated: And what is here said
of the Cause of the <HI>Primary Planet's</HI> Mo∣tions
about the <HI>Sun,</HI> may be understood
of the <HI>secondary Planets</HI> Motions, about
the <HI>Primary ones.</HI> All the <HI>Planets</HI> re∣volve
<PB N="106" REF="257"/>
about the <HI>Sun</HI> in <HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI>
or such as are not very, far different from
them; as also most of 'em, turn round
their own <HI>Axes</HI> from West to East, the
<HI>Earth</HI> in twenty four Hours, about an
<HI>Axe,</HI> which is inclin'd to the Plane of
the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> 66½: and in it's motion a∣bout
the <HI>Sun,</HI> this <HI>Axe,</HI> of the diurnal
Rotation observes always <HI>Parallelism</HI>
with itself, the Reason of which is evi∣dent,
for if a <HI>Sphere</HI> move about an <HI>Axe,</HI>
this <HI>Axe</HI> (there being no other Motion
suppos'd in the <HI>Sphere</HI>) is immoveable,
while in the mean time every Point in the
<HI>Sphere,</HI> describes a Circle about this <HI>Axe,</HI>
and therefore if a <HI>Sphere</HI> move either in a
<HI>curve,</HI> or strait Line, and at the same time
turn round it's <HI>Axe,</HI> the <HI>Axe</HI> shall always
continue <HI>parallel</HI> to that Line it was first <HI>pa∣rallel</HI>
to; for that Impression which per∣petuats
it's Rotation upon it's <HI>Axe,</HI> and the
impulse along the <HI>Tangent</HI> of it's <HI>Orbit,</HI> are
two distinct Motions, which never inter∣fere,
and so each of them must continue
<PB N="107" REF="258"/>
the same as if the other were not; so that
every Body turning about its <HI>Axe,</HI> and
at the same time describing a Right or
<HI>Curve</HI> Line, must of necessity retain it's
<HI>Axe parallel</HI> to itself, if nothing else di∣sturb
it. <HI>Jupiter</HI> likewise, <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Ve∣nus,</HI>
and our <HI>Moon,</HI> do also turn round
their <HI>Axes,</HI> from West to East, and would
retain this <HI>Parallelism,</HI> if not disturb'd by
<HI>Foreign</HI> Violence. The <HI>Satellits of Jupi∣ter</HI>
and <HI>Saturn</HI> do likewise turn round
their <HI>Axes,</HI> as is evident from hence, that
they, like our <HI>Moon,</HI> turn constantly the
the same Face or <HI>Disk</HI> toward their <HI>pri∣mary
Planets;</HI> and it is not improbable,
that the others in which we have not had
the Occasion of observing the like, may
also turn round their <HI>Axes;</HI> that in a Re∣volution
about the <HI>Sun,</HI> they may in all
their Parts oftner than once enjoy his
Light and Heat; for it is from this Rota∣tion
of our Earth upon it's <HI>Axis,</HI> that we
have the <HI>Vicissiudes</HI> of Day and Night,
and from the <HI>Parallelism</HI> of the <HI>Axis</HI> to
itself, in the Earth's Revolution about the
<PB N="108" REF="259"/>
Sun, and its being inclin'd to the Plane of
the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> come the beautiful <HI>Seasons</HI>
of the Year, <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Winter, Spring</HI>
and <HI>Autumn,</HI> which is of such comfort and
use to it's Inhabitants. From the <HI>Opacity</HI>
of the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> and their <HI>Satel∣lits,</HI>
and the <HI>Obliquity</HI> of their Planes to
the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> together with
their diurnal and annual Motions; and
some of 'em revolving in <HI>Orbits,</HI> within
one another, their <HI>Phases,</HI> their appea∣ring
and disappearing, their total and par∣tial
<HI>Eclipses</HI> arise.</P>
<P>§ XV. Since their <HI>Solidity</HI> and <HI>Opacity,</HI>
the <HI>Similar</HI> Nature of their <HI>Orbits,</HI> and
their <HI>hatellitious</HI> Attendance, their Revo∣lutions
about the <HI>Sun,</HI> and their Rotati∣ons
about their <HI>Axes,</HI> their <HI>Gravitations</HI>
and mutual <HI>Attractions,</HI> the Proportion of
their Periods to their Distances from the
Center of Motion, the <HI>equable</HI> Description
of <HI>Area's</HI> in equal Times. Since, I say, all
these and many more Particulars are exa∣ctly
the same in our <HI>Earth,</HI> and the other
<HI>Planets</HI> with their <HI>Satellits,</HI> it is not im∣probable
<PB N="109" REF="260"/>
that they may be alike in other
things, and that they may have Inhabi∣tants
both rational and irrational, Plants
and Vegetables, Water and Fire <HI>analo∣gous</HI>
to, tho' not of the very same Na∣ture
and Constitution with ours; and
since our <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are exactly of the same
Nature with our <HI>Sun,</HI> as shall be after∣wards
made appear, it is very likely that
they have <HI>Planets,</HI> and these <HI>Planets</HI> have
<HI>Satellits,</HI> and these <HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Satellits</HI>
have Inhabitants, rational and irrational,
Plants and Vegetables, Water and Fire, <HI>a∣nalogous</HI>
to those in our <HI>System.</HI> On these
Suppositions, which not only are not ab∣surd
or contradictory; but on the contra∣ry
highly probable, as shall be afterwards
made appear more fully; what a noble
and glorious <HI>Fabrick</HI> wou'd present itself
to our Imaginations? How is it possible for
any one who had this <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Universe,</HI>
to think it possible such a beautiful <HI>System,</HI>
cou'd have been produc'd without infinite
Wisdom? None but the wilful, or obstinate
cou'd resist such a powerful Impression of
<PB N="110" REF="261"/>
divine Power and Wisdom. On the other
Hand, how is it possible to conceive that,
that immense Number of glorious and Sun-like
Bodies of the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> those <HI>vast</HI> and
huge Bodies of some of the <HI>Planets</HI> (in re∣spect
of our <HI>Earth</HI>) with their noble <HI>At∣tendance,</HI>
were made for no other use but
to twinkle to us in Winter Evenings, and
by their <HI>Aspects</HI> to forebode what little
Changes of Weather, or other pitiful Ac∣cidents
were to be expected below, or to
be peep'd at by some poor Paltry Fellows
of Astronomers? Or can any Body force
himself to think, that all <HI>Animals</HI> and
<HI>Plants,</HI> have been exhausted in furnishing
out this poor Corner, while the other
more glorious, great and noble Parts, are
left destitute and bare? Certainly they
must have a great Opinion of themselves,
and of their own Habitation, who can
think so poorly of the rest of the Universe.
But allowing the <HI>Planets</HI> to be inhabited,
and that the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> have their <HI>Planets</HI>
and Inhabitants, yet they are not of the
same Nature and Constitution: with those
<PB N="111" REF="262"/>
of our Globe, as is evident from the dif∣ferent
Degrees of Heat and Light they en∣joy;
as also the different Vicissitudes of Day
and Night; and the Seasons of the Year.
<HI>Mercury</HI> is three times nearer the <HI>Sun,</HI> than
we, and consequently enjoys nine times
as much Heat and Light, he never remo∣ving
thirty eight Degrees from that vast
Body of Light. <HI>Venus</HI> enjoys twice as
much Heat and Light, and her Course
about her <HI>Axe</HI> is perform'd in twenty three
Hours, and so her Day is but one Hour less
than ours; she has all the <HI>Phases</HI> of our
<HI>Moon,</HI> appearing sometimes horn'd some∣times
halv'd. <HI>Mars</HI> has no Inclination in
the <HI>Axe</HI> of his Rotation to the Plane of his
<HI>Orbit,</HI> and consequently enjoys a perpe∣tual
<HI>Equinox,</HI> but no Vicissitudes of Sea∣sons;
he receives but the third Part of
our Light and Heat. <HI>Jupiter</HI> likewise en∣joys
a perpetual <HI>Equinox,</HI> and a Day of∣ten
Hours, but receives only the twenty
fifth part of our Heat, and <HI>Saturn</HI> but the
hundredth.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The <HI>Satellits</HI> of the several
<PB N="112" REF="263"/>
<HI>Planets</HI> suffer many and various Distur∣bances
in their Motions from the <HI>Sun,</HI> as
also, the Primary <HI>Planets</HI> suffer likewise
from the Forces of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and of the
secondary <HI>Planets.</HI> Thus the <HI>Moon</HI> (if a∣cted
upon only by the attractive Force of
the <HI>Earth</HI>) wou'd by a <HI>Ray,</HI> from the
Center of the Earth, describe equal <HI>Area's</HI>
in equal times, wou'd about the <HI>Earth</HI> in
one of it's <HI>Foci,</HI> describe a perfect <HI>Ellipse</HI>
of the same <HI>Species</HI> constantly, whose
Plane wou'd be immoveable, or always
the same, and whose Inclination to the
Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> wou'd never vary;
but by the Action of the <HI>Sun</HI> upon the
<HI>Moon,</HI> all these Effects are disturb'd, for
she neither discribes equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal
Times by a <HI>Ray</HI> from the Center of the
Earth, but somewhat larger ones in her
<HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppositions</HI> with the Sun
than in her <HI>Quadratures.</HI> Neither is her
<HI>Orbit</HI> always <HI>specifically</HI> the same, nor is the
<HI>Earth</HI> in any of the <HI>Foci</HI> of her <HI>Orbits;</HI>
for they are more <HI>Curve</HI> about the <HI>Qua∣dratures,</HI>
and less toward her <HI>Conjunctions</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="264"/>
and <HI>Oppositions,</HI> in every Revolution she
describes a new kind of <HI>Curve,</HI> and both
the Situation of the Plane of her <HI>Orbit,</HI>
and it's Inclination to the Plane of the
<HI>Ecliptick,</HI> varies every Moment, and
all these Uncertainties and Aberrations,
are multiply'd by her nearer or remo∣ter
Distances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> besides a
great many other Irregularities too tedi∣ous
here to relate. Upon the account of
all which, it has been so very hard for <HI>Astronomers,</HI>
to reduce her Motions to Rule,
and to express 'em in Numbers; and yet
all these Irregularities are wonderfully ac∣counted
for, from the Action of the <HI>Sun</HI>
and <HI>Earth</HI> upon her, upon the common Sup∣position
of the Law of Attraction, ev'n to
a Nicety, beyond which Observation can∣not
distinguish, as is evident from Mr.
<HI>Newton's Theory</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> printed in
Dr. <HI>Gregory's Astronomy,</HI> which is a sur∣prising
Confirmation of the Truth of
that Principle. On the other hand, the
Force of the <HI>Sun,</HI> but especially of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> disturbs the Motion of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="265"/>
as is evident from our <HI>Tides,</HI> which do
so exactly follow the Motions of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> that he who knows the former,
with some few collateral Circumstances,
cannot be ignorant of the latter; for when
the <HI>Moon</HI> comes to the vertical Point of
any Place, we have a <HI>Tide</HI> there, as also
on the Place <HI>diametrically</HI> opposite to it;
this <HI>Tide</HI> is greater at the <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and
<HI>Oppositions</HI> of the <HI>Moon</HI> to the <HI>Sun,</HI> than
at her <HI>Quadratures,</HI> and greatest of all at
the <HI>Equinoxes,</HI> especially if the <HI>Moon</HI> is
then in her <HI>Perigeum,</HI> the Reasons of all
which I have suggested in <HI>the first Chap∣ter.</HI>
And what is here said of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
with respect to the <HI>Moon,</HI> may be with
due Limitations understood., of any <HI>pri∣mary
Planet,</HI> in respect of it's <HI>Satellits.</HI></P>
<P>§ XVII. That the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are Bodies
like our <HI>Sun</HI> all the late <HI>Astronomers</HI> a∣gree,
for it's plain they shine by their own
Light, since it is altogether impossible,
that the Light of the <HI>Sun,</HI> shou'd be sent
to them, and transmitted to us, so as to
make them appear so lucid as we see them.
<PB N="115" REF="266"/>
We see how faintly in respect of some
of the <HI>fixt Stars, Saturn</HI> shines for all his
Bulk; and yet his Distance is but a Point
in respect of the nearest <HI>fixt Star,</HI> from
the <HI>Sun.</HI> The Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> wou'd be
so dissipated before they reach'd so re∣mote
an Object, that the best Eye of
the World, cou'd not by it, discover them.
Their Distance is so great, that the best
<HI>Telescope,</HI> instead of magnifying 'em above
what they appear to the naked Eye (as
they do any Object, remov'd by any mensu∣rable
Distance, how great soever) does con∣siderably
lessen them, so that they appear
like lucid Points. Besides, tho' we in this
Globe, approach nearer them some twenty
four thousand <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Earth, (or
188304000 Miles, allowing five thou∣sand
Feet to the Mile) one time of the
Year than another, yet their <HI>Parallax</HI> is
scarce sensible, if any at all, which cou'd not
be, if they were at my moderate Distance:
By Mr. <HI>Hugen</HI>'s Computation, the Distance
of the <HI>Sun</HI> from us, is to the Distance of
the nearest <HI>fixt Star</HI> from us, as 1 to
<PB N="116" REF="267"/>
27664, that is (allowing the Distance of
the <HI>Sun</HI> from us to, be 12000 <HI>Diameters</HI>
of the Earth, and a <HI>Diameter</HI> to be of 7846
Miles, according to the best Calculations)
the Distance of the nearest <HI>fixt Star</HI> from
us, is at least 2404520928000 Miles,
which a Cannon Bullet moving with the
Velocity it has, when parted from the
Month of the Piece, wou'd spend almost
seven hundred thousand Years to go thro'.
Since then, both these are true, that they
shine by their own Light, and that they
are at such an immense Distance from us,
it is plain, they must be <HI>Bodies</HI> like our
<HI>Sun;</HI> which wou'd be evident, cou'd they
be brought near us, or we near them, for it
is only the Distance that creates our doubt.
Now this being true, it is impossible they
shou'd be all in the Surface of the same
<HI>Sphere,</HI> since our <HI>Sun</HI> which is one of
'em, cannot be reduc'd to this Rule. Be∣sides,
their different Magnitudes, shew
that they are at as immense Distances
from one another, as the nearest of 'em
is from us. Let us but imagine our selves
<PB N="117" REF="268"/>
remov'd 'at an equal Distance from the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> we should then certain∣ly
perceive no Difference between them;
for as to all the <HI>Planets,</HI> that we see now
attend the <HI>Sun,</HI> we shou'd not have the
least Glimpse of them; both because
their Light wou'd be too weak to affect
us, and because all their Orbs wou'd be
united, in that one lucid point of the
<HI>Sun.</HI> In this Station, we shou'd have no
occasion to imagin any Difference be∣tween
one <HI>Star</HI> and another, but shou'd
certainly conclude both <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI>
of the same Nature; and knowing the Na∣ture
of one, we shou'd certainly conclude
the same of all the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> that if one
was a lucid Globe of liquid Fire, so wou'd
all the rest be, and that they were at im∣mense
Distances from one another. Cer∣tainly
if the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> actually had <HI>Pla∣nets,</HI>
and they <HI>Satellits,</HI> yet at our Di∣stance
we cou'd see neither. Since then
there are several probable Arguments,
(some of which I hinted before) that they
have Attendant <HI>Planets,</HI> and no possible
<PB N="118" REF="269"/>
one to evict the contrary, we may safely
conclude that the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are so many
<HI>Suns</HI> in the Center of a <HI>System</HI> of <HI>Planets</HI>
and their <HI>Satellits.</HI></P>
<P>§ XVIII. Besides these already men∣tioned,
there is another <HI>Species</HI> of Hea∣venly
Bodies, call'd <HI>Comets,</HI> which re∣volve
about the <HI>Sun;</HI> in very Oblong
<HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI> approaching to <HI>Parabolick
Curves.</HI> The Times of their <HI>Periodical</HI>
Revolutions are very long, since in three
or four Thousand Years, we have not
positively determin'd the Returns of above
one or two; however, its certain, that
like our <HI>Planets,</HI> they do move in a re∣curring
<HI>Orbit,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> is in one of
the <HI>Foci</HI> of this <HI>Orbit,</HI> that by a Ray from
the <HI>Sun,</HI> they describe equal <HI>Area</HI>'s in equal
Times, that the same <HI>Law of Gravitation</HI>
obtains in them, which does in the <HI>Pla∣nets;</HI>
that their <HI>Periodical</HI> Times are cer∣tain
and invariable, and that their Moti∣ons
are regular, only their Course in their
<HI>Orbits</HI> is not determin'd one way, but indif∣ferently
some of 'em move one way, others
<PB N="119" REF="270"/>
another: They are also about the same
Bulk with the <HI>Planets,</HI> generally speak∣ing;
and like them are compact solid
Bodies, but surrounded with a vastly
large thin Fluid, intermixt with several
grosser Particles, and composing an irre∣gular
unequally disposs'd, and uncertainly
agitated Mass; which is call'd its <HI>Atmo∣sphere,</HI>
whose <HI>Diameter,</HI> is ten or fifteen
Times as long as that of its Body. Besides
which, it has a long lucid <HI>Train,</HI> which is
rais'd in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> by the
Heat thereof, and extends sometimes to four
hundred Thousand Miles above its Body.
It is always opposite to the <HI>Sun,</HI> because
it is the thiner part of its <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> ex∣tremely
rarified by his Rays; and so rare
that the <HI>Stars</HI> may be seen through it.
This <HI>Tail</HI> accompanies it through its Course
over all the <HI>Planetary Regions,</HI> encreasing
in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> and lessening
in its Recess. These <HI>Comets</HI> sometimes
come so near the <HI>Sun,</HI> as to be heated
to such a Degree that they cannot be∣come
cool again, in many Thousands of
<PB N="120" REF="271"/>
Years. This with its violent Motion in a
<HI>Curve,</HI> which comes near to a streight Line,
after it has pass'd its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and the
irregular Disposition of the confuss'd
Mass of its <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> makes it an un∣fit
Habitation for Animals, that are not
in a state of Punishment, so far as we can
conceive of the Nature of Animals. And
therefore some have thought it design'd,
to supply the Expence of Fluids in the
<HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Planets.</HI> But as I have before
hinted, this does not seem so very pro∣bable,
because Nature always supplies
constant and regular Expences after a
constant and regular Manner. Now the
Returns of these Bodies are so irregular
and uncertain, and we so little feel the
Effects of these Returns (which of ne∣cessity
must be felt, if these frightful Bo∣dies
made the <HI>Reimbursement</HI> mention'd,
since the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> are recruited all
at once, or in a very short time, of all the
loss they have suffer'd in their Fluids for
many Years before,) that I am afraid no
such benign Influences, are to be expect∣ed
<PB N="121" REF="272"/>
from them. I readily grant, that there
may be some Clouds of Vapours sweep'd
off the <HI>Tails</HI> of these <HI>Comets,</HI> by the <HI>Sun</HI>
and <HI>Planets</HI> as they approach them. But
then, it is uncertain of what Nature these
Vapours are, for every Vapour will not
become a Fluid, unless its Parts be of
such a determin'd <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> as the
Nature of Fluids require. Now it's certain,
that Heat will raise any Body into a Va∣pour,
provided it be sufficient to dissolve
the Union of its Parts, and increase their
Bulk to a necessary Dimension: Moreover
its hardly accountable how the <HI>Sun</HI> shou'd
draw from thence only the Fluid of Light,
the Earth, that of Water, the other <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
their proper Fluids; or if they were
supposs'd to draw all <HI>promiscuously,</HI> how
these Effects can answer the Design, since
Water in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which wanted only
more of the Fluid of Light, wou'd be as
improper a Guest, as Fire on the Earth,
which wanted only more Water. I think
it is more probable, that these frightful
Bodies are the Ministers of <HI>Divine Justice,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="273"/>
and in their Visits, lend us <HI>Benign</HI> or <HI>No∣xious</HI>
Vapours, according to the Designs
of Providence: that they may have brought,
and may still bring about, the great <HI>Cata∣strophes</HI>
of our <HI>System,</HI> by raising of <HI>Tides,</HI>
changing the Figures, and the Positions
of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and the very Nature of
the <HI>Orbits</HI> themselves: and that they may
be the Habitation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a state
of Punishment; which, if it did not look
too <HI>notional,</HI> there are many Arguments
to render not improbable. But as for the
Diminution of the Quantity of Fluids in
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> it is certainly so small
and so inconsiderable (tho' still it be some∣thing)
that it will never be sensible in
any finite Number of Years, and so
needs not so magnificent an <HI>Apparatus,</HI>
as the visit of a <HI>Comet</HI> to supply it; as
to the Diminution of Light, I do believe
it may be demonstrated, that if all the
Fluid which the <HI>Sun</HI> loses in a Year were
brought into a solid Form, it would not
equal a Grain of Sand. Now what is that
to the vast Body of the <HI>Sun?</HI> And as for
<PB N="123" REF="274"/>
the Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> tho' some of them
be reduc'd into a solid Form, yet upon
Examination it will be found that most
of the same is again dissolv'd into a Fluid;
for in all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the
Matter is plain; and as for <HI>Minerals</HI> and
<HI>Metals,</HI> I doubt much, whether there be ve∣ry
many new Productions or Generations
of that kind, since their first Production.
So that tho' there be some loss of Fluids
on <HI>our Globe,</HI> yet there is store enough
to supply all the Uses of Life and Vege∣tation,
for any finite number of Years; and
by the Frame, and make of this our <HI>Sy∣stem,</HI>
it does not seem design'd to last for
ever, without some considerable Changes.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Thus I have given a short
View of this <HI>System</HI> of things, as it is at
present, and I am of Opinion it is pretty
near the Truth. And now let any one se∣riously
reflect upon the <HI>Vastness, Magni∣ficence,
Beauty, Order,</HI> and <HI>Symmetry</HI> of
this <HI>Scheme,</HI> and try if he can think it the
Effect of Chance, or, if he can so much
as doubt, that some infinitely wife and
<PB N="124" REF="275"/>
powerful <HI>Architect</HI> has rear'd this noble
<HI>Fabrick.</HI> But to drive the Argument far∣ther,
let us enquire a little into the par∣ticular
and obvious <HI>Designs</HI> and <HI>Contrivan∣ces</HI>
of this Divine <HI>Architecture.</HI> And 1. It
is plain from what has been shewn, that
the universal Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> or
<HI>Gravitation</HI> obtains in all the Bodies of
this Universe; and that the Motions of
all the <HI>Planets,</HI> their <HI>Satellits</HI> and the
<HI>Comets,</HI> are govern'd by one Condition
thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Force thereof at
different Distances from the Center of
Attraction, is <HI>reciprocally</HI> as the <HI>Squares</HI>
of these Distances. Now is it at all pro∣bable
that so <HI>universal a Law,</HI> so power∣ful
a <HI>Principle,</HI> and so constant a Rule
shou'd be owing to Chance? If one with
10000 Dice, shou'd throw 5000 Sizes,
once or twice, or even 1000 Sizes
once and again, we might possibly say
he did it by Chance; but if with an al∣most
infinite Number of Dice, he shou'd
always without failing throw the same
side in 'em all, we shou'd certainly con∣clude,
<PB N="125" REF="276"/>
he either did it by <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Con∣trivance,</HI>
or that these Dice cou'd turn
up on no other side. Now I have demon∣strated
that <HI>Gravitation</HI> is not <HI>essential</HI> to
Matter, and so it might have been with∣out
it; and yet all the Bodies of the Uni∣verse,
so far as we can discover, are en∣dow'd
with this Principle; and therefore,
it was design'd by him who laid the
Foundations of the World. 2. It is
worth our Observation to take Notice,
how constant and beautiful a Proportion,
the Times of the Revolutions of all the
<HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits,</HI> keep to their
<HI>middle Distances;</HI> for universally, in all
the Revolutions of the <HI>Planets</HI> about the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and of the secondary <HI>Planets</HI> about
the <HI>Primary</HI> ones, the <HI>periodical Times</HI> is
in a <HI>Sesquialter</HI> Proportion to the <HI>middle
Distances;</HI> or the <HI>Cubes</HI> of the middle
Distances, from the Center of their Mo∣tions,
are in all of them (<HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Sa∣tellits</HI>)
as the <HI>Squares</HI> of the <HI>Periodical
Revolutions.</HI> 3. All the <HI>Planets</HI> by Rays
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and all the <HI>Satellits,</HI> by
<PB N="126" REF="277"/>
Rays from their Primary <HI>Planets,</HI> de∣scribe
equal <HI>Area</HI>'s in equal Times, <HI>i. e.</HI>
the <HI>Area's</HI> describ'd, are always <HI>proporti∣onal</HI>
to the Times. So that when they
approach to the Center of their Motion,
they move faster, and when they recede
from it, slower; so as to compensat
their Nearness, by their Swiftness, and
their Distance by their Slowness: Al∣ways
making up equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal
Times. These two so <HI>universal,</HI> and so
<HI>regular</HI> Affections, of the Motions of the
<HI>Celestial</HI> Bodies, are not only discoverable
by Observation, but are the necessary Ef∣fect,
of the Law of Gravitation, just now
mentioned to be the <HI>Principle</HI> of the
Heavenly Motions. Can any Body now,
who considers how many things are con∣curring
to, and depending upon these
beautiful <HI>Proportions,</HI> and regular Effects,
so much as once question whether they
are the Product of infinit Wisdom? Cer∣tainly
nothing less cou'd be sufficient, to
make the <HI>Calculations,</HI> adjust the <HI>Forces,</HI> and
determine the <HI>Powers,</HI> necessary towards
<PB N="127" REF="278"/>
the Production, of such exact and regu∣lar
<HI>Effects.</HI> 4. All the <HI>Planets</HI> are so
wisely situated, in respect of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
that the Denser <HI>Planet,</HI> is still nearest
him, and the less Dense, is farther re∣mov'd
from him; and the least Dense of
all, is the most remote. Now can any
Body think this was so ordered without
<HI>Design?</HI> No certainly, it is so obvious
no Body can miss of it; for it is plain the
more Dense Matter requires a greater De∣gree
of Heat, to fit it for natural Produ∣ctions;
and the less Dense, needs only a
lesser Degree of Heat, for the same End.
And consequently, their Distances were
adjusted for this very Reason; and this
by the bye, is a very good Argument
for the <HI>Planets</HI> being inhabited, since
according to their Densities, they are fit∣ted
with Degrees of Heat necessary for
natural Productions, now this Adjustment
and these natural Productions were useless,
if there were no Creatures to enjoy the Be∣nefit
of 'em; and we all know Nature has
done nothing in vain, And therefore since
<PB N="128" REF="279"/>
these <HI>Accommodations</HI> are provided for li∣ving
Creatures, there are such certainly to
enjoy 'em. 5. The <HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI>
Motions, is so adjusted in respect
of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>Satel∣lits,</HI>
in respect of their <HI>primary Planets,</HI>
that the <HI>Planet</HI> which is nearest the <HI>Sun,</HI>
moves fastest, and those more remote,
less fast, and the farthest, slowest of all.
And so in the <HI>Satellits;</HI> the nearest to the
<HI>primary Planets,</HI> moves quickest, and the
remotest, slowest. For since the <HI>Centri∣petal</HI>
Forces, are <HI>reciprocally,</HI> as the
<HI>Squares</HI> of the <HI>Distances</HI> from the Center,
and the <HI>Celerities</HI> in that case, recipro∣cally,
as the <HI>square Roots</HI> of the Distan∣ces
from the Center; and since the square
Root of the remoter Distance is greater,
than the square Root of the nearer, there∣fore
the Velocity of the nearer, is grea∣ter
than that of the remoter. Now this
is a wise <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the <HI>Author</HI> of
<HI>Nature;</HI> for since the nearer <HI>Planet</HI> enjoys
more of the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> than the re∣moter,
it was fit the Vicislitudes of the
<PB N="129" REF="280"/>
Seasons, shou'd be quicker, that answe∣ring
best the Ends of natural Productions;
for since their Distances are least, and
their Velocities greatest, that are next
the <HI>Sun,</HI> their <HI>Periods</HI> must be shortest;
and since they all move about their <HI>Axes,</HI>
most, if not all of them, making there∣by
some <HI>Angle</HI> or other with the Plane
of their <HI>Orbit,</HI> they must admit of Va∣riety
of Seasons; and where the Heat is
greatest, there for the Conveniency of
natural Production, it was necessary the
Seasons shou'd be shortest, where the
Heat is least, there the Seasons shou'd be
longest: Now all these Effects are taken
care of by this adjusting of the Velocity
to the Distance. And what is here said
of the Seasons in respect of the <HI>Planets,</HI>
may be understood of the <HI>Satellits</HI> Influ∣ences,
from their <HI>primary Planets;</HI> for
whatever Effects the <HI>primary Planets</HI> pro∣duce
on the <HI>secondary</HI> ones, it is doubtless
most convenient, the Vicislitudes there∣of
shou'd be quickest, in the nearest, and
slowest in the remotest <HI>Satellits.</HI> And
<PB N="130" REF="281"/>
this, as well as the former, is a convin∣cing
Proof of the <HI>Planets</HI> being inhabited;
for all this beautiful Contrivance is lost,
if there be no Inhabitant in these <HI>Celestial</HI>
Bodies to enjoy the Benefit of it. 6. All
the <HI>Planets,</HI> describe about the <HI>Sun</HI> in
one of their <HI>Foci, Elliptick Orbits</HI> of one
Species or another; and all the <HI>Satellits</HI>
describe about their <HI>primary Planets</HI> in
one of their <HI>Foci, Elliptick Orbits</HI> also;
and the Planes of all the Orbits do very
nearly coincide with one another, and
with the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick.</HI> That
the <HI>Planets</HI> describe <HI>Elliptick Orbits</HI> about
the <HI>Sun,</HI> there is no manner of doubt
now among <HI>Astronomers.</HI> And tho' they
say, that the <HI>Orbits</HI> of the <HI>Satellits</HI> are
not exactly <HI>Elliptical,</HI> yet that is from
necessary Causes, and is not owing to
Chance, but to the already establish'd
Laws of the Universe; yet still their <HI>Or∣bits</HI>
are nearer <HI>Ellipses</HI> than any other <HI>Geo∣metrical
Curves,</HI> and may be reduc'd to
these; and that the Planes of the <HI>Orbits</HI> of
the <HI>Planets</HI> coincide with the Plane of the
<HI>Ecliptick,</HI> and with one another nearly, is
<PB N="131" REF="282"/>
matter of Observation. Now is it imagi∣nable,
this beautiful and constant Order
of these three things, of <HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI>
the Situation of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the one of the
<HI>Foci,</HI> and the Coincidence of the Planes,
of the <HI>Orbits,</HI> with that of the <HI>Eclip∣tick,</HI>
cou'd have been the Effect of Chance
and Casualty? Or that it was without
Design or Counsel? No certainly, for
the Advantages thereby arising to our
<HI>Earth</HI> in particular, are evident; for there∣by,
the colder and more Northern Places
of our Globe, are brought some hundreds
of thousand Miles, nearer the <HI>Sun</HI> in
Winter, than in Summer; which cannot
but be of some use to those Places, that
by the natural Course of the Earth, are
depriv'd of the benign Influence of the
<HI>Sun</HI> at that Season. Now this Benefit
wou'd be constant if the Place of the
<HI>Perihelium</HI> did not change; but since
that is not constant, the other is not du∣rable,
but temporary. But this change
is not now to be taken notice of, since it
is a Question if these Irregularities were
<PB N="132" REF="283"/>
any part of the first Contrivance of this
Universe. Now tho' in the rest of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> the Situation of their <HI>Perihelia,</HI>
is not the same; yet nothing is to be
concluded from thence, against this Ar∣gument,
since we know not the Nature
of their Inhabitants, nor of their Natural
Productions: But this we may conclude,
since it is of notable Use to one of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> it cannot be amiss to any of 'em,
they agreeing in most things: But what∣ever
be the Design thereof, yet the
constant Order of these things are a suf∣ficient
Proof that they were not Casual,
but the work of Infinite Wisdom, 7. The
<HI>Sun,</HI> all the <HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits,</HI>
so far as we have had occasion to know,
move about their own <HI>Axes,</HI> the <HI>Axe</HI> of
this Rotation is alway <HI>parallel</HI> to itself, and
they revolve all one way from West to
East, and that in Planes, almost coinci∣dent
with one another, and that of the
<HI>Ecliptick.</HI> As to the <HI>Rotation</HI> about their
own <HI>Axe,</HI> it is matter of Observation in
the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="284"/>
the <HI>Moon,</HI> and it is very probable in the
other two; and as to the <HI>Parallelism</HI> of
the <HI>Axe</HI> of their; Rotation, it is demon∣strable
<HI>a priori,</HI> as I have formerly shewn,
and wou'd be nicely exact, if the same
were not disturb'd by some collateral
Causes; as also the Coincidence of the
Planes of this Rotation, with one ano∣ther,
and with the Plane of the <HI>Ecclip∣tick,</HI>
is so very near the Truth, that the
small Difference from it, is not to be
regarded. Now can these constant and
regular Effects be ascrib'd to any thing,
but an over-ruling Providence? Can Jum∣ble,
and Confusion produce regular and
invariable Effects? It is altogether, impos∣sible,
and therefore, nothing but the Au∣thor
of Light, and Order, and Beauty,
cou'd have brought about so uniform,
and such constant Effects. Farther, let
us now consider, that all these beautiful
and comely <HI>Proportions,</HI> all these con∣stant
and immutable <HI>Effects,</HI> all these
uniform and regular Appearances, which
agree, not to a few things, or in some
<PB N="134" REF="285"/>
particulars, but in most of them, to all
the <HI>Planets,</HI> to all their <HI>Satellits,</HI> to the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Moon,</HI> and the <HI>Comets,</HI> and
in a word, to every thing in this our
<HI>System,</HI> might have been varied, seve∣ral
and diverse ways; and yet none of
'em fitted so well, to the present state of
things, and the universal Benefit of the
whole <HI>System,</HI> as these already settled.
Thus there might have been an <HI>infinity</HI>
of different, possible Laws of <HI>Gravitation,</HI>
yet none of them wou'd have fitted our
present Circumstances, so well as to the
<HI>Reciprocal Duplicat.</HI> There are innume∣rable
<HI>proportions,</HI> besides the <HI>Sesquialter,</HI>
yet none of 'em had suited us so well,
because this is the Effect of the Law of
Gravitation, and on these two, all the
subsequent Advantages from the present
establish'd Motions of the <HI>Planets</HI> depen∣ding,
any other different from these
wou'd have depriv'd us of those Advan∣tages.
The various possible Distances of
the <HI>Planets</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> the possible
Times of their <HI>Revolutions,</HI> their possible
<PB N="135" REF="286"/>
<HI>Celerities,</HI> the possible <HI>Figures</HI> of their
<HI>Orbits,</HI> and of the <HI>Inclinations</HI> of their
Planes to one another, and to the Plane
of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> their possible <HI>Densities</HI>
and <HI>Bulks,</HI> and the possible <HI>Changes</HI> of
their many other <HI>Affections,</HI> are in num∣ber
infinite; and yet I have shewn that
most of these as they are at present,
bring very considerable Advantages with
them, to the <HI>System</HI> in general, which
consequently wou'd be lost, were they
dispos'd after another manner. Add to
these, that all these Affections of the <HI>Hea∣venly
Bodies,</HI> might have been in no re∣gular
Order, nor constant Proportion,
at all, and consequently the possible
Varieties of the <HI>Celestial, Bodies</HI> might
have been infinite among 'emselves, and
different from those now mentioned. But
seeing every thing is adjusted by <HI>weight</HI>
and <HI>measure,</HI> seeing they observe <HI>Order</HI>
and <HI>Proportion,</HI> and that every one of
'em is dispos'd in the fittest <HI>Order,</HI> the
present state of things will admit, since
both the whole and the several Parts of
<PB N="136" REF="287"/>
the <HI>Celestial Fabrick</HI> is both very good,
useful, and convenient, who that con∣siders
all these things, dares so much as
doubt whether he who did all these things
<HI>lives and reigns for ever and ever?</HI> or who
can forbear to admire and adore him, who
<HI>weigh'd the Mountains in Scales, and the
Hills in a Balance, who stretch'd the Hea∣like
a Curtain,</HI> and held the Earth in his
Hands, <HI>whose right hand,</HI> and <HI>strong Arm
does wonderful things past finding out.</HI></P>
<P>§XX. Having now considered, some
of the more general Affections, of the
<HI>Heavenly Bodies,</HI> and of their Motions,
and shewn some of the Advantages, arising
from their, present Order and Disposition.
I come now to consider the <HI>Celestial Bo∣dies</HI>
a little more particularly, and first as
to the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> can any thing beget
a greater <HI>Idea</HI> of the Universe, or of it's
Creator, than that <HI>prodigious</HI> number of
glorious Bodies, like our <HI>Sun,</HI> rang'd all
up and down the <HI>immense Vast,</HI> and
remov'd at Distances from one another
answerable to their Distance from us? This,
<PB N="137" REF="288"/>
not only their different <HI>apparent Magni∣tudes,</HI>
but likewise the number of those
of the first, and second Rate, does evince.
For upon the Supposition, that every <HI>fixt
Star,</HI> is like our <HI>Sun,</HI> and governs in a
Portion of <HI>Mundan space,</HI> equal to our <HI>Sy∣stem,</HI>
then there must be only as many <HI>fixt
Stars</HI> of the first Magnitude, as there are
<HI>Systems</HI> that can stand round ours; but there
are but about twelve or thirteen <HI>Spheres,</HI>
that can stand round a middle one, equal
to 'em; and so many are the <HI>Stars</HI> of
the first Magnitude. Again, if we examine
how many <HI>Spheres</HI> can stand round this
first Range of <HI>Spheres</HI> we will find their
number betwixt forty eight and fifty two,
and so we find the number of the <HI>Stars</HI>
of the second Magnitude. As for the se∣veral
other Magnitudes, it is not alto∣gether
possible to determine their num∣ber,
because they are not so distinguish∣able
from those of the other Magnitudes,
as the first and second are. Besides, I
do not plead here for Accuracy, but on∣ly
for things being nearly so; for, I do
<PB N="138" REF="289"/>
not think that the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> are either
all of the same real Magnitude, or that
their <HI>Systems,</HI> are all of the same Dimen∣sions:
these things being nearer any Re∣gular
Proportion, than they are to Irre∣gularity,
is sufficient for my Purpose; for
it is impossible for any Body, seriously to
consider in his Mind, or view with his
Eyes., what is certain about these glori∣ous
Bodies, to hinder himself from being
ravish'd with the Power and Wisdom of
the <HI>Great God of Heaven and Earth.</HI></P>
<P>§XXI. How <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>glorious</HI> a
Body is the <HI>Sun,</HI> and of what absolute
Necessity to the Being of all <HI>Animals</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables!</HI> As to <HI>Vegetables,</HI> it is beyond
all doubt, that without him they cou'd
never rise above the Ground; for it is
his Heat alone, that rarifies the sizy Jui∣ces
about their tender Roots, and makes
them force their way, to display all the
Foldings of the slender Seed, and there∣by
to augment their Parts; just as we
find his Heat, raises the Liquor in the
<HI>Thermometrical</HI> Tubes, and drives them
<PB N="139" REF="290"/>
through all it's winding Branches, and
tho' perhaps <HI>Animals,</HI> might make a sor∣ry
Shift (supposing Food cou'd be sup∣ply'd
'em without his Influence) in a
perpetual State of Darkness, yet it wou'd
be a very miserable sort of Life, and cou'd
be of no long continuance; for we know,
how necessary the <HI>Sun</HI> is to purifie our
Air, and to exhale the <HI>noxious</HI> Dews, and
the baleful Vapours of the Night; we
feel a sensible Joy in his Light, and Hea∣viness
in his Absence; foul Weather, and
a cloudy Day, is a Disease alone, and he
who understands the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI>
knows the Reasons, and the <HI>Mechanical</HI>
Necessity of all these things. One thing
ev'ry Body knows, <HI>viz.</HI> that by the
Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the Action of his
Rays, that infinite Number of the <HI>excre∣cretory
Ducts</HI> of Perspiration, plac'd along
all the superficial Parts of the Body are
open'd, and enlarg'd, and so those Exha∣lations,
which Nature has design'd shou'd
be carry'd out of the Body, are more
freely and plentifully deriv'd; which must
<PB N="140" REF="291"/>
needs give a greater Freedom to the Blood
and Spirits, the contrary of all which,
happens in the Absence, of this <HI>Benign
Star.</HI> But of this more afterwards. It's
being situated immoveable in the Cen∣ter
of our <HI>System,</HI> no Body who has been
at the pains to consider the Matter, I be∣lieve
doubts now, for not to mention at
present the Controversie about the <HI>Paral∣lax</HI>
of some of the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> which Mr.
<HI>Fla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stead</HI> has observ'd, and whereby he
pretends to demonstrate the Motion of
the Earth, and consequently the Stability
of the <HI>Sun;</HI> there are some other Argu∣ments
that will have sufficient Weight to
settle the Matter among thoughtful Men,
For 1. It is altogether impossible to ac∣count
for the Appearances of the <HI>Planets,</HI>
their <HI>Satellits,</HI> and of the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> in any
tolerable manner, without admiting the
Motion of the Earth. 2. It is likewise
impossible to account for the Motions of
the <HI>Comets,</HI> upon, any other Supposition.
And 3. that Analogy of the <HI>Periodical</HI>
Times, to the <HI>midle Distances,</HI> which
<PB N="141" REF="292"/>
is the necessary Consequence of the esta∣blish'd
Law of Gravitation, does demon∣strate
the Earth's Motion <HI>à priori;</HI> so that
unless we wou'd subvert the whole <HI>System</HI>
of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> and disprove the Causes of
all the Celestial Motions, we shall never
be able to prove the Stability of the
<HI>Earth.</HI> For if the Celestial Bodies attract
one another in a <HI>duplicate Proportion reci∣procally,</HI>
to their Distances from the Cen∣ter
of their Revolutions, then the <HI>Earth</HI>
(and not the <HI>Sun</HI>) moves. Add to all
these, that there is no tolerable Objecti∣on
against the Earth's Motion, but has
had a full Answer, and a plain Solution.
Now what an Instance of Wisdom and
Contrivance is this, in placing that Foun∣tain
of Light and Life, in the Center of
his <HI>System.</HI> How unartful wou'd it have
been, to have set him in a Corner, when
he was to have giv'n Light and Warmth
to all the Bodies round him; besides, to
the conservation of any such Supposition
(such as the <HI>Tychonick</HI> or <HI>Ptolomick.</HI>) there
are requir'd so many different Laws of
<PB N="142" REF="293"/>
<HI>Gravitation,</HI> that any reasonable Person
by inquiring into them, wou'd easily dis∣cover,
that whatsoever was Matter of
fact, yet this Position of ours was the
the most simple and easie, and look'd most
like the Effects of Wisdom and Design:
For here one single Law, accounts for all
the various Motions and Appearances of
the <HI>Celestial Bodies.</HI> Thus then this great
and glorious Body is fixt, like a powerful
and a kindly <HI>Monarch</HI> on his Throne,
distributing Light, Warmth, and Life in
plentiful Effusion, to all his surrounding
<HI>Vassals,</HI> and that so equally, that the
nearest have not too much, nor the re∣motest
too little. These are such great,
such wise Ends, as clearly speak the <HI>Om∣nipotence</HI>
and <HI>Omniscience</HI> of their <HI>Author.</HI>
Moreover, let us consider, with how
much Artfulness his Bulk and Situation, in
respect of the <HI>Planets,</HI> is contriv'd to have
just Quantity enough of Matter to draw
round him these Massy Bodies, and their
<HI>Satellits,</HI> so various in their Bulks and Di∣stances
from him; and that in regular
<PB N="143" REF="294"/>
and uniform <HI>Orbits.</HI> How exactly his
Body is rounded, how fully it has been
saturated with the Fluid of Light, to be
able to last so many Years without any
sensible Diminution, tho' there are con∣stant
Emanations thereof upon his Atten∣dents.
As for his <HI>Rotation</HI> about his own
<HI>Axe,</HI> it is no doubt likewise, for wise
Ends and Purposes, perhaps it may be for
the better propagating, and emitting this
Fluid of Light, through the <HI>Planetary
Regions;</HI> but I am rather inclin'd to be∣lieve
it may be the necessary Effect of the
Fluidity of his Body, it being very well
known, that the Particles of all solid Bo∣dies
running into susion, by the Force of
the heat, are turn'd innumerable different
ways; and so by their Opposition and In∣terferings,
are at last determin'd, into a
circular Motion of the whole one way.
However this Matter be, we have here
sufficient Instances of Wisdom and De∣sign
to enforce upon us the Belief that
a being infinitely perfect is the Author
thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="295"/>
§ XXII. We can no otherwise gather
the usefulness of the <HI>secondary Planets,</HI> to
their <HI>primary</HI> Ones, but by supposing the
rest may reap <HI>respectively,</HI> some thing <HI>a∣nalogous,</HI>
to the Benefits we of the Earth,
receives from our <HI>Moon,</HI> which are 1. The
supplying of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Night time,
for at least three fourths of the Year. Now
how comfortable and delightful a thing
this is, Travellers and Voyagers can best
tell, <HI>Curiosity, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI>
have now made it necessary, that some part
of Mankind shou'd be travelling by Land
or Sea, in the Night Seasons; how plea∣sant
then, and joyful a thing, is it to have
a Light held us forth from <HI>Heaven,</HI> not
only to guide our Steps, but to direct us
in our Course, and to point out to us,
how our time wears out? For a very lit∣tle
Experience, makes us reap both these
last Advantages from the Presence and
Motion of the <HI>Moon.</HI> 2. She raises our
<HI>Tides,</HI> twice in twenty four Hours, which
how absolutely necessary it is toward the
subsistance of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> we
<PB N="145" REF="296"/>
shall now shew. Every Body knows that
a <HI>Lake or Loch,</HI> that has no fresh Water
runing into it, will by the heat of a few
Months, and its Stagnation, turn into
a stinking rotten <HI>Pudle,</HI> sending forth
nauseous and poysonous Steams; for tho'
I do not think, the constituent Particles
of Water themselves, are alter'd by this
Stagnation, yet no Water is absolutely
pure, but contains a greater Quantity of
Fleshy, Bony, Earthy, Salin, Metallick,
and Vegetable Particles, than of pure <HI>E∣lement;</HI>
and it is upon these, the heat
operates, by dissolving their Union, and
combining 'em in new Forms, and sepa∣rating
these <HI>noxious</HI> Particles which pro∣duce
this Effect. Now tho' there be ma∣ny
thousands of fresh Water Rivers, daily
runing into the <HI>Sea,</HI> yet they are very in∣considerable
in respect of the <HI>vast Ocean</HI> of
Salt Water, and wou'd by no means hin∣der
it's Stagnation, and consequently it's
Corruption and Stinking. But admit the
Ocean once stagnated, and then the first
Effect wou'd be, that all the Places to∣ward
<PB N="146" REF="297"/>
the Shores, wou'd be first wrought
upon by the Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and turn'd
to a <HI>Mephitis,</HI> and then by Degrees it
wou'd get farther, till the whole were
become more <HI>baneful</HI> and <HI>poysonous</HI> than
the Lake of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> where∣by
the <HI>Fishes</HI> wou'd be first destroy'd, and
by the noxious Steams thence arising, af∣terwards
the <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Animals;</HI> where∣as
by this Action of the <HI>Moon,</HI> the Wa∣ters
are lifted up in a heap, as it were,
and then let fall again; whereby the Wa∣ters
near the Shores, are constantly se∣cur'd
from Stagnation and Corruption,
and the begining Malady stifled. This
perpetual Change of new Water on the
Shores, keeping any one Portion thereof,
too short a time, expos'd to the heat of
the <HI>Sun,</HI> to have it's mixture corrupted.
Now what a <HI>noble</HI> Contrivance have we
here! by appointing an <HI>Attendant</HI> to
our <HI>Earth,</HI> all the <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI>
are preserv'd from certain Destruction;
(but I am of opinion that to the full effect
of this wise Design, the Salt of the Sea
<PB N="147" REF="298"/>
does very much contribute; for as I have
said before, and may observe afterward,
the pointed slender Particles of the <HI>Salt,</HI>
stick the Parts of Bodies so together,
that the Particles of Heat, cannot so easi∣ly
tear 'em as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder.) Besides this, how
many Conveniencies for our <HI>Navigation,</HI>
in Rivers and Harbours, does this ebbing
and flowing of the <HI>Sea</HI> afford? No Body
that considers them, can cease from won∣der,
or can continue in Unbelief. And
here perhaps it will not be amiss to con∣sider
that if our <HI>Earth</HI> had any more than
one <HI>Moon</HI> attending it, that we shou'd
receive more Damage than Advantage from
it; for tho' perhaps thereby our Light in
the Night (provided she were of any Bulk,
or at any Distance near to that of our pre∣sent
<HI>Moon</HI>) might be augmented, yet at
the <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppositions</HI> with one a∣nother,
and with the <HI>Sun,</HI> we shou'd have
Tides that wou'd raise the Waters to the
tops of our Mountains, and in their <HI>Quadra∣tures</HI>
we shou'd have no Tide at all. In
short, if our <HI>Moon</HI> were biger or nearer the
<HI>Earth,</HI> or if we had more than one, at any
<PB N="148" REF="299"/>
tolerable distance from us, We shou'd be every
now and then, in hazard of being drown'd;
and if our present <HI>Moon</HI> were less, or at a
greater distance, or if there were none
at all, we shou'd be in hazard of being
stifled by the noxious Steams arising
from the <HI>Ocean,</HI> which wou'd stagnat
more than it now does. From all which
it's evident how wisely our <HI>Satellit,</HI> has
been contriv'd for our Purposes. As for
the numerous Attendants of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and
<HI>Saturn,</HI> they must be reasonably expected
to fit the Necessities of the Inhabitants of
these <HI>Planets,</HI> since our Moon suits us so
well, and tho' the Fluids of these <HI>Planets,</HI>
be not in so great hazard of corrupting from
the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> yet they may pos∣sibly
be in hazard of being congeal'd by
the Violence of the Cold, and the fre∣quent
tossing and turning over of them,
by the united, or separated Forces of so
many <HI>Moons,</HI> may hinder this Effect; for
we sufficiently know, how strongly Fluids
in Motion will resist the Efficacy of Cold.
However the thing be, we may here ob∣serve
<PB N="149" REF="300"/>
one very signal Instance of <HI>Wisdom</HI>
and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> in placing the Heavenly
Bodies at such a Distance from each other,
and especially the greatest at the greatest
Distance; for had they been situated much
nearer to one another, they wou'd have
caus'd prodigious Disorders in very diffe∣rent
Manners, and in particular such de∣structive
<HI>Tides,</HI> where-ever there was any
Quantity of Fluids, or great <HI>Oceans,</HI> that
neither <HI>Animals</HI> nor <HI>Vegetables</HI> wou'd have
been able to sustain their Fury; which
by this prudent placing the <HI>Heavenly Bo∣dies,</HI>
at such a Distance from one ano∣ther,
are intirely prevented. 3. From our
<HI>Moon</HI> the <HI>Eclipses</HI> call'd by her Name pro∣ceed,
which is of exceeding use in <HI>Navi∣gation;</HI>
for by them the Differences of
<HI>Meridians,</HI> and the <HI>Longitudes</HI> of Places
are determin'd. Of the same use are the
<HI>Eclipses</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and of the <HI>Satellits</HI>
of the other <HI>Planets;</HI> which last being
so frequent, are of wonderful Assistance,
toward the Solution of this so desirable
and so much despair'd of <HI>Probleme.</HI> And
<PB N="150" REF="301"/>
upon this Head of <HI>Navigation</HI> all <HI>Astro∣nomy</HI>
comes in, without which the other
were meer groping in the Dark; but the
World is already so sensible of the Ad∣vantages
arising from the Motions and
Appearances of the <HI>Heavenly Bodies,</HI> in the
Matter of <HI>Navigation,</HI> that I shall insist
no farther on this <HI>Topick,</HI> but from this
whole Section about the Use of the <HI>At∣tendants</HI>
of the <HI>Planets</HI> shall infer, that
they are not mute Persons, in this great
<HI>Drama</HI> of the World, but loudly pro∣claim
the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Being</HI> of their
<HI>Author.</HI></P>
<P>§ XXIII. As to the <HI>Comets,</HI> I have lit∣tle
more to say about them, than what
I have already said, their <HI>Natures, Orbits,
Motions,</HI> and <HI>Situations,</HI> have been so
lately determin'd, (indeed it is but of late,
that the <HI>Astronomy</HI> of the <HI>Planets</HI> them∣selves,
and their <HI>Satellits</HI> has been brought
to any tolerable Perfection, and much la∣ter
since final Causes have been cultiva∣ted,
with that Care becoming so noble
and useful a Part of <HI>Philosophy.</HI>) and
<PB N="151" REF="302"/>
there are so few accurate Observations a∣bout
'em extant, so few of 'em, that
we know of, have visited us twice, that
we have scarce any solid Foundation to
build our Reasoning upon. Only, as
I have before hinted, these <HI>blazing Stars</HI>
seem not design'd for the Habitation of
<HI>Animals</HI> in a state of Happiness, nay ev'n
scarce of <HI>Animals</HI> not under a State of Pu∣nishment;
they may be the first <HI>Rudi∣ments</HI>
of <HI>Planets,</HI> not as yet brought into
our <HI>System,</HI> or rather the <HI>Ruins</HI> of some
banish'd thence, to wander in these long
<HI>Eccentrick Orbits,</HI> through the World. But
most likely they are the <HI>Ministers of di∣vine
Justice,</HI> sending baleful Steams, from
their long Trains, upon the <HI>Planets,</HI> they
come nigh; and if what is commonly said
of 'em by <HI>Astrologers</HI> be true, they seldom
visit us without some such direful Salu∣tation.
However, from them we may
learn that the <HI>Divine Vengeance,</HI> may find
a seat for the punishment of his Disobe∣dient
Creatures, without being put to the
expense of a new Creation.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="303"/>
§ XXIV. Come we now to enquire
into the Wisdom of the Contrivance of
the <HI>Planets.</HI> But having already shewn
the <HI>Analogy</HI> between them and our <HI>Earth,</HI>
and how probable it is that they are in∣habited
by Creatures fitted for such Habi∣tations,
I shall content my self with point∣ing
out some of the most considerable In∣stances
of <HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> in this our
<HI>Planet;</HI> hoping the Reader will reason
after the same manner (bateing particular
Circumstances) of the rest, and that, both
because the design'd Brevity of this Trea∣tise
will not permit me to be so particu∣lar,
as the Subject deserves, and because,
if the <HI>Analogy</HI> hold in general, the parti∣cular
ones (with allowance for Circum∣stances)
will easily follow. And first let
us consider the Advantages, arising to us
by the <HI>Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> about it's
own <HI>Axis.</HI> We the Inhabitants of this
Globe are so made, that once in sixteen
or twenty Hours at most, we require a
Time for <HI>Relaxation,</HI> and generally speak∣ing,
in all healthful People this time is
<PB N="153" REF="304"/>
pretty equal, between six and nine Hours,
the Store-houses of our Spirits will not
permit any longer Application than twen∣ty
Hours, without Injury to our Constitu∣tions,
and much about the Time of six
Hours is requir'd to fill 'em again; and
generally speaking, it is necessary that
an Alternation of <HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Relaxa∣tion,</HI>
shou'd be once in twenty four Hours.
It's true Custom and Education, may get
the better of these <HI>natural Propensities,</HI>
and a very strong Constitution may bear
out with harder Measures for some time;
but the Young, and the Weak, and al∣most
all at their own Liberty, natural∣ly
run into a <HI>Relaxation,</HI> and recruiting
their Spirits by Sleep, once in twenty
four Hours. It was likewise necessary,
that the Air shou'd be at least cool and
temperate, during the time of this Rest,
for we generally find those that sleep in
the open Air, or ev'n while the <HI>Sun</HI> is
above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the worse for it; the
<HI>Sun</HI> and Heat exhaling the natural Perspi∣rations
too violently, and raising too quick
<PB N="154" REF="305"/>
a Motion, in the Blood, whereby the
Sleep is less calm, and more disturb'd.
And tho' we generaly perspire more in the
Night than the Day, yet this is more na∣tural,
and less violent, and more accor∣ding
to the Necessities of our Constituti∣on,
in the Night than the Day. Besides,
that of necessity, the Darkness is less
subject to Noise and Disturbance, than
the Day. Now all these things are won∣derfully
provided for by the <HI>Rotation</HI> of
the <HI>Earth</HI> about its <HI>Axis;</HI> for thereby we
have the <HI>Vicissitudes</HI> of Day and Night,
the Day for <HI>Application</HI> and spending our
Spirits in, about the Necessities of Life,
the Night by its Coolness and Quiet, to
afford us time to recruit 'em, and lay up
in store, for the Expenses of the next
Day; as also for nourishing the Muscles,
Bones, Channels, and the other Parts of
the Body; for the Business of Nutrition
is mostly, if not altogether perform'd in
the time of Rest, because the Blood has
too rapid and quick a Motion, the Ex∣penses
of the Spirits are too great, to af∣ford
<PB N="155" REF="306"/>
Leisure, or Materials, for nourishing
the Parts in the time of Application: Be∣sides
that a gentle uniform Motion is re∣quir'd
to apply nourishing Parts, to the
necessary Places, and to settle 'em there;
and we generally find that People reco∣vering
from a Disease, and Children, sleep
more, and are more fed by their Sleep,
than any other <HI>Animal Function,</HI> and
gross People naturally sleep longest. Like∣wise,
what a comfortable and refreshing
thing is the cool Breezes of the Night, to
those that live under the <HI>equatorial Parts,</HI>
without which Life wou'd be both ex∣ceeding
short, and very grievous. More∣over,
let us reflect upon the Necessities
of our <HI>Vegetables,</HI> which are the Support
of Animals; we have before said, that
the Heat of the <HI>Sun</HI> rarifies and conse∣quently
raises the sizy Juices, at the Roots
of the tender Seeds, and thereby forces
the folded Branches to expand and en∣large.
Now were the <HI>Sun</HI> constantly, or
for any long time, shining upon them;
these Juices wou'd not be at liberty to
<PB N="156" REF="307"/>
settle, and consolidate in the fit Places
of the Branches; but wou'd be still
rising higher and higher, till at last
they burst the Tops of the Canals, and
consequently cou'd produce nothing;
whereas by this <HI>Vicissitude</HI> of Heat and
Cold, what is rais'd in the Day-time,
has time to settle and consolidate in the
Night, and it's Cold runs the thin Juices
first into thick, sizy, Substances, which
the supervening Heat, by exhaling the
watery Parts (which are now brought
nearer the Surface of the <HI>Plant</HI>) does
harden and fix. This we evidently see
in <HI>Nutgals,</HI> and the other Excrescences of
the Leaves of <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and generally,
Countries that have moderately cool
Nights, produce <HI>Vegetables</HI> of the firmest
Union of Parts; and very hot Countries,
suddenly bring up their Seeds, but their
Parts are less firmly stuck together; they
may be heavier, but not so tough or hard,
tho' this too depends much upon the
Constitution, and first make of the Seed.
On the other Hand, had not the <HI>Earth</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="308"/>
mov'd upon its <HI>Axe,</HI> but only turn'd round
the <HI>Sun</HI> in its <HI>annual Period,</HI> we had not
only lost all these Advantages, which
are so beneficial, if not absolutely neces∣sary
to the Being of our <HI>Animals</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables,</HI> but we had suffered also such
Inconveniences, as neither of these cou'd
possibly bear; for then, for very near one
half of the Year we shou'd have been in
perpetual Darkness, the Consequence of
which wou'd have been, that first baleful
and sulphureous Damps (by the Forces of
the preceding Heat generated and rais'd.)
wou'd have fall'n, which wou'd have sti∣fled
all the <HI>Animals,</HI> or had they surviv'd
that, by Degrees, exceeding Rains wou'd
have been pour'd down (as the Vapours
became cooler) next Sleet, then Snow,
and Ice, and Frost, which wou'd of ne∣cessity,
not only have lock'd up all Fluids,
but wou'd' have freez'd the Blood and
Spirits in the Channels, of all the <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
we are acquainted with; for as I
have shewn before, there is a saline Body
constantly swiming in our Air, which by
<PB N="158" REF="309"/>
the Presence and Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> is so
attenuated and reduc'd into so slender
Particles, whose Points (being easiest bro∣ken)
by the Force of the Fluid of Light
are first beat off, as not to be able to do any
Damage, but in <HI>his</HI> Absence, they shoot
themselves into oblong sharp Wedges,
which stick together the Parts of all Bo∣dies.
Now in a half Years Absence of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> in what Quantities, and with how
much firmness wou'd these Saline Bodies
have form'd themselves! Certainly nothing
that moves, whether <HI>Animate</HI> or <HI>Inanimate,</HI>
wou'd have been able to support such a cold
And all this is not only demonstrable <HI>a
priori,</HI> but is Matter of fact, and actually
happens in those Places that are under the
<HI>Poles,</HI> during a much shorter Absence of
this <HI>glorious Star.</HI> Again, in the enlight∣ned
half of the Year, we shou'd have had,
first huge Deluges of melted Waters, from
the preceding Snow, which likewise wou'd
have produc'd suffocating Mists; next all
our Ground, wou'd have turn'd into a stiff
stinking <HI>Puddle,</HI> (being in a manner dis∣solv'd
by the Force and Quantity of the
<PB N="159" REF="310"/>
Snow Water) then wou'd <HI>sultry Heats</HI>
and a burning Air have gall'd us, that
we shou'd have found rest, neither in
Houses nor Dens; till at last the Heat
encreasing without Abatement, the Blood
and Spirits of all the <HI>Animals</HI> of our <HI>Globe,</HI>
wou'd be quite exhal'd, or they turn'd
delirous by the violent Agitation of the
Blood and Spirits, and then dy'd in <HI>Con∣vulsions,</HI>
like so many Puppies in the
<HI>Dog-Days;</HI> for it were absolutely im∣possible,
that any thing that has Life
shou'd resist such a Degree of Heat. It's
true, there are some People live under the
<HI>Aequator,</HI> yet they have but a scurvy time
on't, tho' they are supply'd with constant
Breezes, arising from the <HI>Earth</HI>'s <HI>Rotation</HI>
about her <HI>Axis,</HI> and prodigious Quantities
of Rain, falling by the Plenty of Vapour,
rais'd by the Days Heat, and let fall by
the supervening Cold of the Night, ha∣ving
as long a Night as they have a Day,
which is a mighty Relief, the continued
uninterrupted Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> being
by much a far harder part, than the Degree
<PB N="160" REF="311"/>
of the Heat at stated Seasons. And as
for the <HI>Poles,</HI> we have very certain Infor∣mation,
that few if any at all, inhabit
near 'em. The extreme Degrees of Heat
and Cold that happen there, being in∣compatible
with an <HI>Animal</HI> Life. But
that which makes the Case much worse
than in any part of our <HI>Globe,</HI> upon this
Supposition, is, that the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI>
wou'd be both direct, and there cou'd be
no Rains nor Winds because it is the cool∣ing
of the Air, that is the Cause of both;
which by no means cou'd happen in our
Case, every succeeding Hour heating the
Air to a greater Degree than the former.
Add to all these, that our Seas even not∣withstanding
our <HI>Tides,</HI> wou'd either be
exhal'd, or turn'd into Desarts of Salt,
and so, not only our Fishes wou'd be
destroy'd, but we cou'd have no fresh
Waters, seeing we cou'd have no cool
Air to send it down: If we had any
<HI>Plants</HI> or <HI>Vegetables,</HI> they wou'd be but
of one particular kind, <HI>viz.</HI> those which
require the greatest Degrees of Heat, but
<PB N="161" REF="312"/>
it is demonstrable we shou'd have Occa∣sion
for none; for any body who under∣stands
the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> will easily
see that no <HI>Animal,</HI> such as we have on
our <HI>Globe</HI> now, cou'd bear such an ex∣cessive
and uninterrupted Degree of Heat.
Upon all which Accounts it is very plain,
that the present <HI>Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
about her <HI>Axe,</HI> is one of the most signal
Instances of Wisdom and Contrivance,
that can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>§ XXV. Next let us combine this
<HI>Diurnal Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> about its
own <HI>Axe,</HI> with the <HI>Annual Revolution</HI> of
the same about the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Paral∣lelism</HI>
of the <HI>Axe,</HI> of the <HI>Diurnal Rota∣tion</HI>
with itself: And from thence we
shall have the beautiful Seasons of the
Year; Seed time, and Harvest, Summer,
and Winter; the comfortable Vicissitudes
of colder and warmer Periods, of Snow,
and Rain, Winds and Calms, of shorter
Days, and longer Nights, and again of
longer Days, and shorter Nights, and of
all those delightful Changes, which are
<PB N="162" REF="313"/>
so pleasant, comfortable, yea, and ne∣cessary
in our present Circumstances. If
the <HI>Earth</HI> had only turn'd about her own
<HI>Axe,</HI> once in twenty four Hours, then
all our <HI>Vicissitudes</HI> wou'd have been of
Days, and Nights; which by no means
wou'd have been sufficient for <HI>Vegetation.</HI>
If the <HI>Earth</HI> had made a <HI>Period,</HI> about
the <HI>Sun,</HI> once in the Year, without any
<HI>Rotation,</HI> we shou'd have had but one
long Day, and another equal Night;
which as I have shewn, wou'd not have
agreed, neither with Life, nor Vegetation.
If both these had been united without
the third of the <HI>Parallelism</HI> of the <HI>Axe</HI>
of the <HI>Diurnal Rotation</HI> to itself, we
might have had Days and Nights, but
our other Seasons wou'd have been un∣certain,
and in some Places none at all;
and so the Effect of the Annual Revolution
wou'd have been destroy'd in some Measure.
But by this wise Conjunction of all these
three Modifications, we enjoy our Sea∣sons,
and the other consequent Changes
of the Year, which are of so great use to
<PB N="163" REF="314"/>
us; for had we enjoy'd a constant uni∣form
Season all the Year round, sup∣pose
of Summer Weather, then our
Ground had been exhausted, and worn
out by constant bringing forth of <HI>Vege∣tables,</HI>
and wou'd have run into Weeds,
and those other Plants that require the
least rich Soil, and most Heat only; so
that in a few Years the <HI>Earth</HI> wou'd have
been reduc'd into a <HI>Wilderness</HI> of unuse∣ful
Herbs; for toward the Production
of the more useful Plants, there is re∣quir'd
(besides a certain Degree of Heat
and Moisture,) a <HI>Lixivial</HI> and <HI>Nitrous
Salt,</HI> which keeps the Mould loose (for re∣ceiving
the moist Air, and for the entry
of that Heat and Moisture.) For tho' <HI>Salts</HI>
consolidat Water, which consists of solid
porous Parts, whereby their Particles are
stuck together, yet they keep the Parts of
Mould or Sandy Clay (which has little
or no Water) asunder, and loose, by
the same very Reason, for their Particles
not allowing them entry into themselves,
they get betwixt 'em, and first separate
<PB N="164" REF="315"/>
their union, and then keep 'em from
coming together; and perhaps both for∣ward
the Motion of the Liquors in the
<HI>Vegetable</HI> Channels (which are certainly
endow'd with some Degree of <HI>Elasticity,</HI>
and so capable of being stimulated, as is
evident in younger Twigs and Branches,
as well as <HI>Animal</HI> ones) and endows the
Juices with the Qualities the <HI>Plant</HI> re∣quires.
Now these are either quite ex∣hausted,
or destroy'd, by constant Growth
and <HI>Vegetation.</HI> We see the best Ground
wears out in a few Years, and turns
into wild useless Weeds; and all the
Materials for enriching Ground, are ga∣thered
from Places, debar'd from the
Action of the <HI>Sun</HI> and the Expences
of <HI>Vegetation,</HI> but exposs'd to the Air,
and Weather, whereby they are im∣pregnated
with this <HI>Nitrous Salt:</HI> Such
are old Turf, new Mould, the Dung,
and Excrements of <HI>Animals,</HI> or those
things which abound with <HI>Lixivial Salts;</HI>
such are burnt Wood, burnt Turf, Stubble,
and the like. Now all these, wou'd by a
<PB N="165" REF="316"/>
short Time's uninterrupted <HI>Vegetation.</HI>
have been quite spent. Add to these,
that in a perpetual <HI>Summer,</HI> there
would not fall sufficient Quantities of
Rain, to moisten and soften the Mould,
to that Degree that is necessary for con∣stant
<HI>Vegetation;</HI> for we find there is more
than twice or thrice as much Rain falls
in the <HI>Winter</HI> six Months, from <HI>September</HI>
to <HI>April,</HI> than in the <HI>Summer</HI> six Months;
and yet all this is but sufficient for one
six Months <HI>Vegetation.</HI> Moreover, even
the <HI>Animals</HI> themselves, cou'd not con∣veniently
bear a perpetual <HI>Summer;</HI> for
we find now, that the cold of the <HI>Win∣ter,</HI>
by stoping the Pores of the sensible
Perspiration, keeps the Warmth more
within, whereby there is a greater Quan∣tity
of Spirits generated, the Blood is
less rarify'd, the natural Functions, are
more strong, and perform'd with more
Vigour, the Digestion is better, the sen∣sible
Excretions more natural, and less
violent, and the Crudities of the pre∣ceding
<HI>Summer</HI> are settled and digested,
<PB N="166" REF="317"/>
I mean, in healthful and sound <HI>Animals</HI>
(for the Case is quite otherwise in <HI>Valetu∣dinary
ones,</HI> as of necessity it must be) and
in a moderate and not over tedious <HI>Win∣ter;</HI>
wheras in <HI>Summer</HI> the Blood is more
rarify'd, the Spirits more exhausted, the
<HI>sensible Perspirations</HI> more violent, and
less natural, the Digestion worse, and
all the Concoctions less thoroughly per∣form'd.
So that it is evident we cou'd bear
neither of these States perpetually, the
Change of the <HI>one</HI> being absolutely ne∣cessary
to qualify the Errours and Ex∣treams
of the <HI>other.</HI> If we had a per∣petual
<HI>Summer,</HI> we shou'd be reduc'd to
meer <HI>Skeletons;</HI> if a perpetual <HI>Winter,</HI> we
shou'd turn Dull, unactive <HI>Drones.</HI> Now
perhaps against all these it may be ob∣jected,
that there are rational Creatures,
who inhabit this <HI>Globe</HI> of ours, who are
perpetually in both these Extreams, and
yet are found to be not at all dispos'd,
as I pretend they wou'd be. To this I
answer, that tho' as to the Presence or
Absence of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they may be much
<PB N="167" REF="318"/>
the same as I suppose, yet, there are other
concurring Circumstances, which arise
from the <HI>Vicissitudes</HI> of the Seasons in
the other Parts of the <HI>Globe,</HI> which alters
the Case quite; for there are constant
Seasons of Rain, in the more <HI>Southern</HI>
Countries, which fall for some conside∣rable
time, that both hinders the perpe∣tual
<HI>Vegetation,</HI> softens the Mould, and
fattens it for the next Crop; there are
Clouds of Snow, and Rain, impregnated
with these <HI>nitrous Salts,</HI> which are driven
(by the Force of the Winds) from colder
into these hotter Countries and there fall∣ing,
do enrich the Ground. Besides that,
even the Clouds, rais'd from these hotter
Countries themselves, when destill'd into
Rain, are sufficient for this end; for as I
have said before, the Air every where is
full of such <HI>Salts,</HI> as is known by Experi∣ment.
Let any one consult <HI>Varenius,</HI> and
he will be satisfied that these Southern
Countries have <HI>Winters,</HI> though not of
Snow, yet what is abundantly sufficient to
stop the perpetual <HI>Vegetation,</HI> to moisten,
<PB N="168" REF="319"/>
soften and fatten the Mould, and to cool
the Blood, and other Fluids of the <HI>Ani∣mals.</HI>
Now the Principal thing that
makes this <HI>Poetical</HI> state of a Perpetual
<HI>Summer,</HI> unfit for the present Constitution
of the <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is, that
in such a state (either arising from only a
<HI>Diurnal Rotation,</HI> without an <HI>Annual,</HI> or
an <HI>Annual</HI> without a <HI>Diurnal</HI>) there wou'd
not be that variety of Rains, and cool
Breezes, nor constant, and Trade-winds,
nor overflowing Rivers, and such like
Circumstances, which are the Effect of
this Combining these two Motions to∣gether.
I need not shew the Inconveni∣ences
of a perpetual <HI>Winter,</HI> every Body
is sufficiently sensible, that upon such a
Supposition, we shou'd have neither <HI>Ve∣getable</HI>
nor <HI>Animal</HI> in a very short Time;
especially of any considerable use, or va∣lue,
such as require a <HI>Summer</HI>'s Heat, for
their Growth; and as for <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Au∣tumn,</HI>
they are not so much distinct Sea∣sons
from the two former, as Gentle <HI>Gra∣dations</HI>
and easie Steps, whereby the one
<PB N="169" REF="320"/>
slides into the other, through the inter∣mediate
Degrees. From all which it is evi∣dent,
how wisely these three so different
Modifications, have been link'd together,
for the Benefit of the Inhabitants of this
<HI>Globe;</HI> for by these, we have sufficient Heat
in <HI>Summer,</HI> to ripen the Fruits that are the
product of every respective <HI>Climat;</HI> and
we are furnish'd with Reason, and made
capable of Industry, to transfer the Pro∣ducts
of one Country to another; we
have Rain, and cooling Breezes in the
<HI>Winter,</HI> of those Countries, where Heat
is not wanting, to cool, soften and en∣rich
the Mould, and to stop constant
<HI>Vegetation;</HI> and we have Frost and Snow
in others, where the Heat is not to spare,
to lock up the Mould from being wash'd
away, and keep in either the natural, or
adventitious Heats, till the time that all
Circumstances concur, to have the pro∣duct
of the Ground brought to its <HI>Vege∣tation.</HI></P>
<P>§ XXVI. Come we now to consider
the <HI>Obliquity</HI> the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="321"/>
to that of the <HI>Aequator,</HI> or of the <HI>Axe</HI> of
the <HI>Diurnal Rotation,</HI> to the Plane of the
<HI>Annual Orbit</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which makes
an <HI>Angle</HI> of 66 ½ Degrees. I have alrea∣dy
shewn, that if the <HI>Equator</HI> and <HI>Eclip∣tick</HI>
had coincided, it wou'd have ren∣dred
the <HI>Annual Revolution</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI>
quite useless; for if the <HI>Earth</HI> had mov'd
about its own <HI>Axe,</HI> and this <HI>Axe</HI> had been
at right <HI>Angles</HI> with the Plane of the <HI>E∣cliptick,</HI>
the same Appearances as to the
<HI>Vicissitudes</HI> of Day and Night, had hap∣pen'd,
whether the <HI>Earth</HI> had mov'd
round the <HI>Sun,</HI> or not; and the Alte∣rations
of Seasons, and all the Conse∣quences
thereon depending, had not been
at all; and what a hinderance this wou'd
have been to <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Vegetation,</HI> I have
already shewn. Besides that in the <HI>Torrid
Zone,</HI> the Heat wou'd have been intolera∣ble,
and not to have been endured; and in
the <HI>frigid Zones,</HI> the Cold wou'd have
destroy'd both <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and even in the <HI>Temperat Climats,</HI> the one
half of e'm wou'd have made but a very
<PB N="171" REF="322"/>
comfortless Habitation, for such Crea∣tures
as we now are; so that but only
the other half, wou'd have been any
ways, a tolerable Seat for rational Crea∣tures,
and five sixths at least of the whole
Globe, wou'd have been rendred useless.
But <HI>God</HI> who is wiser than Man, has
contriv'd the Matter much better; for by
this present <HI>Obliquity</HI> of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> to
the <HI>Equator,</HI> we reap one very considera∣ble
Advantage, which is taken notice of
by my very learn'd and ingenious Friend
Mr. <HI>John Keill,</HI> and that is, that we be∣yond
the forty fifth Degree of <HI>Latitude,</HI>
and who consequently have the greatest
need of the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat, have more of it,
take the whole Year about, than if the
<HI>Sun</HI> had mov'd continually in the <HI>Equator;</HI>
and they that live in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> and
the adjacent Places, even to the <HI>Latitude</HI>
of forty five Degrees, who are rather too
much exposed to the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
than too little, have by these Means,
less of his Heat, than they wou'd have
had, had the <HI>Earth</HI> observ'd a right Po∣sition.
<PB N="172" REF="323"/>
Those who desire to see the De∣monstration
of this, may consult Mr.
<HI>Keill</HI>'s Examination of Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>The∣ory</HI>
of the <HI>Earth</HI> pag. 71. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> To
these add, that since this <HI>Globe</HI> of ours,
has been design'd for a Habitation of ra∣tional
and irrational Creatures, of vari∣ous
<HI>Tempers, Constitutions</HI> and <HI>Dispositions,</HI>
and for <HI>Vegetables</HI> of different <HI>Natures</HI> and
<HI>Virtues,</HI> requiring different Degrees of Heat,
and Nourishment, to ripen, and bring 'em
to Perfection, (to shew the <HI>manifold</HI> Wis∣dom
of the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> in the Va∣riety
of every thing.) And since we find
the present Heat of the <HI>Torrid Zones,</HI> ve∣ry
well fitted for all the Kinds of <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that inhabit and grow there,
the Cold of the <HI>Frigid Zones,</HI> very tole∣lerable
to the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> and <HI>Productions</HI>
of these Places, and the <HI>Temper</HI> of the
intermediate ones, suited to theirs; those
<HI>Animals</HI> that cannot transport themselves,
and the <HI>Vegetables</HI> that require a greater
Degree of Heat, not having too much,
and the like <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> that
<PB N="173" REF="324"/>
can suffer cold, not having too little Heat,
and the rational Creatures being endow'd
with Reason and Means, to transport
themselves where they live most at ease.
And since it was impossible to have ac∣commodated,
all these so various and dif∣ferent
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> in a place of
an equable and uniform, (or in one, and
in the same) <HI>Climate,</HI> it's evident that the
present Situation of the <HI>Axe</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
to the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> is the best (of
that infinite Variety possible) that cou'd
be, for our present Circumstances; for
by any other very considerable <HI>Alteration,</HI>
all or most of the mention'd Advantages
would be lost. For all which Reasons we
can never sufficiently admire, the <HI>Wisdom</HI>
of the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> who has provi∣ded
so liberally, and prudently for his
Creatures.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The same divine Wisdom,
is conspicuous, in the Situation of the
<HI>Earth</HI> in respect of the <HI>Sun;</HI> for had the
Distance between the <HI>Earth</HI> and the <HI>Sun,</HI>
been the same with the Distance between
<PB N="174" REF="325"/>
<HI>Mercury</HI> and the <HI>Sun, i. e.</HI> were we brought
three times nearer the <HI>Sun</HI> than we are, or
the <HI>Sun</HI> brought three times nearer us than
he is, our Ground in Winter, wou'd have
been hotter than red hot Iron, and what a
Condition we shou'd have been in then, we
may easily guess. On the other Hand,
had the <HI>Sun</HI> been remov'd from us, or we
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> to the Distance <HI>Jupiter</HI> or
<HI>Saturn</HI> are remov'd, our hottest <HI>Summer
Day</HI> had not afforded so much Heat, as
those that now live under the very <HI>Polar
Star</HI> (if any such there be) of our Globe
feel in the midst of Winter. Are not
we then very wisely provided for, who
are put in such a Mediocrity, between
these two extream Distances, that neither
our Heat nor Cold is so violent, but that
we may either endure 'em, or with a little
Industry fence our selves against their Inju∣ries?
Again, as to the <HI>Figure</HI> of our <HI>Earth,</HI>
tho' it be the necessary Result of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s <HI>Rotation</HI> about its own <HI>Axe,</HI> and the Flui∣dity
of the superficial Parts of the <HI>Earth,</HI> at
the Commencement of this Rotation; yet
<PB N="175" REF="326"/>
it is very convenient for us. By the
<HI>Earth</HI>'s Motion about its <HI>Axe,</HI> the Parts en∣deavour
to recede from the same <HI>Axe</HI> as
much as they possibly can, by a <HI>centrifugal</HI>
Force, arising from the circular Motion;
and therefore, if the Matter of any of the
Heavenly Bodies, was fluid, at the Com∣mencement
of this circular Motion, it
wou'd necessarily have risen from the <HI>Poles,</HI>
and accumulated at the <HI>Equator,</HI> and so in∣duced
a <HI>spheroidical</HI> Figure on the <HI>Planets</HI>
Body, generated by the <HI>Circumvolution.</HI>
of an <HI>Ellipse</HI> about its lesser <HI>Diameter.</HI>
Now since it is evident to our sight, as∣sisted
with a good <HI>Telescope,</HI> particularly,
in <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that the <HI>Diameter</HI> at the <HI>Equa∣tor</HI>
is longer, than that at the <HI>Poles,</HI> and
since Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demonstrated that
<HI>Earth</HI> is at least seventeen Miles higher
at the <HI>Equator</HI> than at the <HI>Poles,</HI> its plain
that at the Commencement of the diur∣nal
Rotation, the Surface of the <HI>Planets</HI>
has been covered with a Fluid; which
gives an Account why at every forty or
fifty fathoms, below the Surface of our
<PB N="176" REF="327"/>
<HI>Earth,</HI> we never miss of Water. It is
likewise evident from this Figure of the
Body of the <HI>Planets,</HI> that the Surface of
the <HI>temperate Climates</HI> is larger than it
wou'd have been, had the <HI>Globe</HI> of our
<HI>Earth,</HI> or of the <HI>Planets,</HI> been either <HI>sphe∣rical</HI>
or <HI>oblongly spheroidical;</HI> so that the
Advantage of this Figure is very conside∣rable,
the Surfaces of the <HI>Polar Regions,</HI>
which by reason of the oblique Incidence
of the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> upon them, are
colder, and less convenient for the Habi∣tation
of <HI>Animals,</HI> and the Production of
the nobler Sort of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> are hereby
considerably lessened, and the Surfaces or
Space about the <HI>temperate Zones,</HI> which
are most comfortable and useful, are
thereby considerably enlarged. The same
Figure obtains not only in the <HI>Earth,</HI> and
the rest of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits</HI>
but likewise in the <HI>Sun,</HI> and universally
in every fluid Body revolving about an
<HI>Axe.</HI></P>
<P>§▪ XXVIII. Having shewn some of the
Advantages arising from the several Mo∣tions
<PB N="177" REF="328"/>
of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the Combination
of these, which are common to the other
<HI>Planets,</HI> I come now briefly to consider, those
that possibly may be more particularly be∣longing
to our <HI>Globe,</HI> and are not the im∣mediate
Consequence of its Motions; and
the first in order is our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> of
such Necessity toward the subsistence of
<HI>Animals,</HI> and the growth of <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
that neither, cou'd be any considerable
time without it. This <HI>Atmosphere</HI> is a thin
<HI>Elastick</HI> Fluid, intermixt with Particles of
different Natures, surrounding our <HI>Globe</HI>
to the heighth, of about forty or forty
five Miles. The Nature and Properties
of this Fluid, I have in some manner shewn
already. But some of it's uses I shall now
point out, and first as to <HI>Vegetation,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Grew</HI> and <HI>Malpighi</HI> have shewn that it is
a principal concurrent therein, it being
more easily rarified, and heated by the
<HI>Action</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> than other more com∣pact,
heavy, and less <HI>springy</HI> Fluids, is
fitter to promote the Ascent of the Jui∣ces
in the slender Channels of <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="329"/>
and there being no Fluid without a con∣siderable
Portion thereof, lodged up and
down among it's Parts, the first Impulse
of the Juices upwards, does thence arise.
Moreover, as to <HI>Animals</HI> it is well known,
that they cou'd live but a few Minutes
without this <HI>Elastick</HI> Fluid, and probably
that which so suddenly kills thunder-struck
<HI>Animals,</HI> is the quick and violent Rarefa∣ction
of the Air about them; for the
<HI>Lungs</HI> of all such upon opening, are found
quite destitute of Air, and the sides of
their <HI>Vesicles</HI> quite clap'd together. It's
certain, that the Blood is sent from the
right Ventricle of the Heart to the <HI>Lungs,</HI>
and if the Vesicles thereof be not disten∣ded
or blown up, by the Air, the <HI>Circu∣lation</HI>
must stop there, and the <HI>Animal</HI>
perish; and both for the Comminution
of the Particles of the Blood, that they
may more easily pass through the <HI>Capilla∣ry</HI>
and terminating Vessels, and for the
Propagation thereof in the wider ones,
there is necessarily requir'd a Fluid of a
determinate Gravity, and <HI>Elasticity.</HI> We
<PB N="179" REF="330"/>
have as great Difficulty of breathing, in
a thin as in a thick Air; and ev'n in <HI>Fish∣es,</HI>
where the Water in some measure
supplys the want of Air, yet if you draw
out all the Bubbles of Air, which are al∣ways
found in Water, they will languish
and dye; so that ev'n to them, a certain
Portion of this <HI>Elastick</HI> Fluid, is necessary.
Now how well is this Fluid fitted for the ge∣nerality
of the Inhabitants of this <HI>Globe?</HI>
it being neither too heavy, nor too light,
neither too much, nor too little <HI>elastick,</HI>
for the uses of Respiration. Another Ad∣vantage
we reap by our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> is,
that by it our <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI> are sup∣ported,
without which we shou'd neither
have fresh Water, nor Snow, nor Rain,
nor any of those things, which moisten
and enrich our Soil, and make it fit for
<HI>Vegetation.</HI> For tho' it be the <HI>Sun</HI> that ra∣rifies
the Water, and makes it take its
first flight in <HI>Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Steams;</HI> yet
its by the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> it's Progress is conti∣nued
to the upper Regions, and suppor∣ted
when it is there, to be afterwards
<PB N="180" REF="331"/>
form'd into Snow, or Hail, or Rain, or
carried into other Regions, whose Soil
does want it more. Every Body knows,
that if there were no <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> but a
perfect <HI>Void</HI> around the. <HI>Earth,</HI> the
Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> wou'd not be able to
raise the <HI>Vapours</HI> above a few feet, from
its Surface; and that its only the <HI>Atmo∣sphere</HI>'s
being <HI>specifically▪</HI> heavier, than
these <HI>Vapours,</HI> that buoys 'em up in
the Air, by its greater Tendency toward
the Center. Now then, if there were
no <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> the <HI>Vapours</HI> cou'd rise to
no sufficient heighth, and so cou'd never
be cool'd sufficiently, so as to be form'd
into Snow, or Rain; for at a small distance
from the <HI>Earth</HI>'s Surface, the reflected
Rays of the <HI>Sun,</HI> make the Places so warm,
that no <HI>Vapour</HI> cou'd be turn'd into Snow▪
or Rain, there; for it's the Coldness of
the upper Regions, (being destitute of
these reflected Rays) and the length of
of their Descent, that forms these <HI>Clouds</HI>
and <HI>Vapours</HI> into Snow, and Rain, when∣ever
the supporting <HI>Atmosphere</HI> becomes
<PB N="181" REF="332"/>
lighter▪ than these accumulated <HI>Vapours,</HI>
they fall down with the Temper of Heat
or Cold, they had in the <HI>upper Regions,</HI>
and so become Snow, or Rain according∣ly.
So that its plain, it's our <HI>Atmosphere</HI>
that is one of the principal Means of our
Dews, and Rains, and all the Blessings,
that follow upon these. A third Advan∣tage
of our <HI>Atmosphere</HI> is, our <HI>Breezes</HI>
and our <HI>Winds,</HI> which carry our Ships
upon the Sea; and purifie our Air, from
noxious Steams, which (with the Concur∣rence
of the <HI>Sun</HI>) melt our Snows, and
dry our Ground when over-moistned;
and serve for so many other Purposes,
for the Accommodation of Humane Life▪
<HI>Wind</HI> is nothing but a violent Motion of
the Air, produc'd principally by its Rare∣faction,
more in one Place, than another,
by the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Beams, the <HI>Attractions</HI> of
the <HI>Moon,</HI> and the Combinations of the
<HI>Earth</HI>'s Motions. Without our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI>
we shou'd have no more <HI>Wind</HI> above,
than under Ground, and so be depriv'd
of all the Benefits arising thence. Lastly,
<PB N="182" REF="333"/>
Our <HI>Atmosphere</HI> is the Vehicle and <HI>Medi∣um</HI>
of sound, that Sense which mostly
distinguishes us from <HI>Fishes,</HI> and the infe∣rior
sort of <HI>Insects. Sound</HI> is nothing
but a <HI>Modulation</HI> or <HI>Percussion</HI> of the Air,
communicated by an impulse, from the
vibrating sonorous Body, and propagated
in <HI>Ʋndulations,</HI> through the Fluid of the
<HI>Atmosphere,</HI> ev'ry way round. Without
our Air we shou'd not be able to hear
the Report of a thousand Pieces of Ord∣nance
discharg'd at the smallest Distance;
we shou'd have no such thing as Langua∣ges
or <HI>Musick,</HI> and what a comfortless
state this wou'd be, I leave the Reader
to judge. From all which it's very plain
that there was <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> in the
Contrivance and Production of our <HI>At∣mosphere.</HI></P>
<P>§ XXIX. The next thing in Order
to be considered is, our <HI>Mountains,</HI>
without which it were almost impossible
for <HI>Animals</HI> to subsist, or <HI>Vegetables</HI> to
grow, they being one of the principal
concurrent Causes toward the Producti∣on
<PB N="183" REF="334"/>
of our fresh-water Rivers. It has
been shewn from Calculation, by seve∣ral
Persons, and particularly the inge∣nious
Professor of Geometry at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Ed. Halley,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> raises Va∣pours
from the Surface of the Sea, in a
Year, sufficient to supply all the Rivers
with fresh Water for that time. Now
these Vapours being rais'd (the <HI>Sun</HI> act∣ing
upon the Surface of the Sea, as a
Fire under an <HI>Alembick</HI> by rarifying the
same, it makes the lightest, <HI>i. e.</HI> the
freshest Portions thereof, to rise first;
and it rarifies the Water by the Insinu∣ation
of its active Particles among the
porous Parts thereof, whereby they are
put in a violent Motion innumerable dif∣ferent
ways, and so are expanded in∣to
little Bubbles of larger Dimensions
than they formerly had, and by that
means become <HI>specifically</HI> lighter, and
so are buoy'd up by the weightier <HI>Atmos∣phere</HI>)
in such Quantities, as is sufficient
to make Streams of Vapours, which rest∣ing
in those Places, where the Air is
<PB N="184" REF="335"/>
of equal Gravity with them, are carried
up and down the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> by the Course
of that Air, till they at last hit against
the sides of the more eminent and <HI>Moun∣tainous</HI>
Places, of the <HI>Globe,</HI> and by this
Concussion are condensed, and thus be∣come
heavier than the Air they swom in,
and so gleet down the rocky Caverns of
these <HI>Mountains,</HI> whose inner Parts be∣ing
hollow, and stony, afford them a
<HI>Bason,</HI> till they are accumulated in suffi∣cient
Quantities to break out at the first
<HI>Crany;</HI> whence they descend into the
Plains, and several of them uniting, form
Rivulets, and many of these Rivers; so
that it is evident the great Benefit of these
Eminences is not, that by the Shock these
Vapours get in their Course from them,
they are condens'd, so as to be precipita∣ted
thereby through the Chinks of the
Rocks, but that afterwards in their Bow∣els
they are preserv'd, till they be of suf∣ficient
quantity to form Rivulets, and then
Rivers; for doubtless our Vapours wou'd
fall in Rain, and Dew, tho' there were
<PB N="185" REF="336"/>
no <HI>Mountains,</HI> but then they wou'd fall
equally, over considerable Places of the
<HI>Globe</HI> at once, and so wou'd be suck'd
up in the Ground, or make an <HI>universal
Puddle;</HI> whereas by these <HI>Mountains,</HI> they
are perpetually almost, (at least a Nights)
pouring down in some particular Places,
and there treasuring up, for a constant
Supply to the Rivers. Another very con∣siderable
use of these <HI>Hills,</HI> and <HI>Eminen∣ces,</HI>
is the Determination of these Rivers;
for tho' there had been Rivers without
Mountains, (which is hardly possible) yet
in that case the Rivers cou'd only have
run in a straight Line, if they had run at
all; whereas, by these <HI>Eminences,</HI> plac'd
up and down the <HI>Globe,</HI> the Rivers make
innumerable beautiful turnings and wind∣ings,
whereby they enrich, fatten, and
water the Soil of several different Coun∣tries
in one Course, make the Transpor∣tations
and Carriage over Lands more ea∣sie
and manageable, and at last disem∣bogue
in several Mouths into the <HI>Sea;</HI>
where, by the assistance of the <HI>Tides,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="337"/>
they from Harbours and Ports, for the
convenience of <HI>Shiping</HI> and <HI>Navigation.</HI>
All these Advantages we have by our
<HI>Mountains;</HI> for tho' from other Causes,
we might possibly be supply'd with fresh
Water <HI>Springs,</HI> (tho' Nature seldom is
<HI>Luxuriant</HI> in diversity of Causes) yet
without our <HI>Mountains</HI> we cou'd never
have Rivers, nor cou'd these Rivers have
such delightful turnings, nor those useful
falls, which gives them an impetuosity
that may be improv'd to so many delight∣ful
as well as profitable Uses. Thus we
see of what Advantage these unsightly
Mol's (as some thought them) are to
the Accommodations and even Necessities
of living.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Next come our Fluids to be
considered, without which we cou'd ne∣ver
have been, seeing they are a very <HI>es∣sential</HI>
part of us; that which I shall prin∣cipally
take notice of, is, 1. The few∣ness
of the <HI>original</HI> and <HI>primary</HI> Fluids, in
respect of that vast Number of compoun∣ded
ones, which are indeed numberless.
<PB N="187" REF="338"/>
The <HI>primary</HI> ones are only four, <HI>viz. Air,
Water, Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light;</HI> three of which
are but seldom much compounded with
others, so that it is Water alone, or <HI>Lymph,</HI>
that is the <HI>Basis</HI> of all our Mixtures, and
it is the parts of solid Bodies floating in
this Fluid, that produces all our delight∣ful
and useful varieties of Liquors; so
frugal is Nature in <HI>Principles,</HI> and so
fruitful and various in Effects and Com∣positions.
2. The great Difference be∣tween
the <HI>specifick</HI> Gravities of our Fluids,
<HI>Mercury</HI> being about 8000 times heavier
than <HI>Air.</HI> Now not to mention the ma∣ny
uses of this last Fluid in Artificers
Works, had <HI>Air</HI> been as heavy as <HI>Mercury,</HI>
it had been altogether useless in respirati∣on;
on the contrary, it had choaked us
immediately; and had there not been a
Fluid of the same weight with <HI>Mercury,
i. e.</HI> a collection of exceeding small, vast∣ly
heavy <HI>Spherules,</HI> in the present Cir∣cumstances
of Mankind, I do not know
what a great part of the World would have
done. For the Lewdness and Debauch∣ery
<PB N="188" REF="339"/>
of Mankind, has brought a great ma∣ny
Diseases to that degree of Malignity▪
that I scarce see how a thorough Cure
cou'd be made of 'em, without this Fluid;
for it's certain, wherever any Distemper
arises from an obstruction of the Blood
Vessels, wherein the <HI>Globules</HI> themselves,
and not the <HI>Serous</HI> part is principally con∣cern'd,
that this Fluid, if not absolutely
necessary, is extreamly beneficial; for no∣thing
has sufficient force to take away
this obstruction, and to separate these
<HI>Globules</HI> from one another, in the extreme
<HI>capillary</HI> Vessels, but a little weighty <HI>Sphere,</HI>
such as the Particles of <HI>Mercury</HI> certainly
are. Now by this difference of the <HI>Spe∣cifick</HI>
Gravity of the Fluids, a Remedy is
provided for all these Maladies, which I
am satisfied are more than two or three.
But that which is most wonderful in these
Fluids, is, 3. The universal condition of
the direction of their <HI>Pressure</HI> upon the
sides of the containing Vessel; for in all
Fluids of whatsoever kind or nature, this
<HI>Pressure</HI> is communicated in Lines <HI>perpen∣dicular</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="340"/>
to the sides of the containing Ves∣sel.
Now this Property of Fluids, which
is so beautiful and uniform, is the neces∣sary
Consequence of the <HI>Sphericity</HI> of their
constituent Particles; for since by the
third Law of Nature, <HI>Reaction</HI> or <HI>Repulse</HI>
is always equal and contrary to Impulse
or Action, in the same Direction, conse∣quently
the sides of the containing Vessel
presses the contain'd Fluid, as much as
the contain'd Fluid presses the sides of the
containing Vessel; and this <HI>pressure</HI> of the
sides of the containing Vessel, is directed
in the same right Line with that of the
contain'd Fluid, but is contrary to it. Now
seeing a <HI>right Plane,</HI> can only touch a
<HI>Sphere,</HI> in a point, and can press it in a
direction through that point of Contact;
if this Direction through the point of <HI>Con∣tact,</HI>
do not likewise pass through the Cen∣ter
of the <HI>Sphere,</HI> the <HI>Sphere</HI> will necessa∣rily
revolve upon the <HI>Plane</HI> till the Dire∣ction
of its <HI>pressure,</HI> from the point of
<HI>Contact</HI> pass through the Center of the
<HI>Sphere;</HI> just to likewise, if a <HI>Plane</HI> press
<PB N="190" REF="341"/>
two <HI>Spheres,</HI> in the same Direction, the
Line of this Direction will necessarily pass
through both their Centers. And so if
there be any number of <HI>Spheres</HI> whatever,
press'd by a <HI>Plane</HI> in the same Direction,
the Line of this Direction will necessarily
pass through all their Centers. But a Line
through the Center of a Sphere from the
point of Contact, is <HI>perpendicular</HI> to the
<HI>Tangent Plane;</HI> and since this is the Dire∣ction
of the <HI>pressure</HI> of the <HI>Plane</HI> upon the
<HI>Spheres,</HI> it is also the Direction of the
<HI>pressure</HI> of the <HI>Spheres</HI> upon the <HI>Plane.</HI>
Since also the Particles of Fluids, are <HI>Sphe∣rical,</HI>
or nearly approaching thereto, and
since they are suppos'd exceeding small,
as also since <HI>curve</HI> surfaces are compoun∣ded
of an infinite Number of little plain
surfaces, it is universally true, that all
Fluids of what nature soever, press the
sides of the containing Vessels in a Dire∣ction
<HI>perpendicular</HI> thereto. And on the
other hand, since by <HI>demonstration,</HI> it is
true, that Fluids do press the sides of the
containing Vessels, in a Direction <HI>perpen∣dicular</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="342"/>
thereto, it's certain that the Par∣ticles
of all Fluids are <HI>Spherical,</HI> or nearly
approaching thereto; so that this is now
no more <HI>Hypothesis</HI> but <HI>Demonstration.</HI>
Now cou'd any thing but the Fingers, and
<HI>Almighty Power</HI> of God, have rounded
those infinite numbers of small Particles,
whereof Fluids consist? or cou'd any thing
but his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> have assign'd them their
true dimensions, their exact weights and
requir'd Solidities? We shall allow him to
continue in his infidelity who can demon∣strate
by what Laws of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> all
the Particles of Water were turn'd of the
same <HI>Diameter,</HI> Solidity and Weight, and
those of Air, <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> turn'd
all of different <HI>Diameters,</HI> Solidities and
Weights from one another; but all of the
same <HI>Diameters,</HI> Solidities and Weights
among 'emselves.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. What a noble representati∣on
of the Divine Wisdom does our Fluid
of <HI>Light</HI> afford us! how wonderfully are
its parts fram'd! and with what a prodi∣gious
<HI>velocity</HI> are they sent from the Body
<PB N="192" REF="343"/>
of the <HI>Sun!</HI> its Subtility is almost beyond
imagination, no Pore so small as to ex∣clude
it; no Stream of it so great, but
may be congregated into a single Point;
no Surface so finely polished, as not to
scatter almost one half of it; its Rays tra∣verse
through one another, millions of
different ways, without interfering ev'n
in the straitest Passages; in one Word,
we are not able to comprehend nor ima∣gine
a Number sufficiently small, to ex∣press
its subtility; in every Pulse of an <HI>Ar∣tery,</HI>
it runs some <HI>hundred and thirty thou∣sand
Miles;</HI> what an amazing, and uncon∣ceivable
<HI>velocity,</HI> must this be! nothing
but the action of the Mind, can any ways
represent it: And then what a beautiful
<HI>Idea</HI> of this Fluid, do Mr. <HI>Newton's la∣ter
Discoveries</HI> present us with, ev'ry Ray
is endow'd with its own <HI>Colour,</HI> and its
different degree of <HI>Refrangibility</HI> and <HI>Re∣flexibility.</HI>
One Ray is <HI>Violet,</HI> another
<HI>Indigo,</HI> a third <HI>Blew,</HI> a fourth <HI>Green,</HI> a
fifth <HI>Yellow,</HI> a sixth <HI>Orange,</HI> and the last
<HI>Red.</HI> And these are the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>ori∣ginal
<PB N="193" REF="344"/>
Colours,</HI> and from the mixture of these,
all the intermediate ones proceed, and
<HI>White</HI> from an equable mixture of the whole;
<HI>Black</HI> on the contrary, from the small quan∣tity
of any of them being reflected; or,
all of them in a great measure being suffo∣cated.
So that now it is not Bodies that
are coloured, but the <HI>Light</HI> that falls up∣on
them, and their Colours arise from
their <HI>Aptitude,</HI> to reflect Rays of one Co∣lour,
and transmit all those of another.
Their prominent little Parts, upon their
Surfaces, according to their different De∣grees
of <HI>density</HI> and <HI>thinness,</HI> are apt to
reflect back upon our <HI>Organs,</HI> Rays of one
Colour, and of one degree of <HI>Refrangi∣bility</HI>
and <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> and to let others
pass through their Pores; and this one Co∣lour
too, is less or more intense, accord∣ing
as their prominent parts are of diffe∣rent
<HI>densities,</HI> or are thicker or thinner. For
the first degrees of <HI>Intenseness,</HI> in all the
<HI>primary</HI> Colours, seem to arise from
some determin'd degrees of <HI>density</HI> and
<HI>thinness;</HI> and the subsequent degrees from,
<PB N="194" REF="345"/>
the other different degrees of density or
thickness or thinness, of the prominent
little parts, of the Surfaces of Bodies.
<HI>Light</HI> acts upon Bodies by heating, dissol∣ving,
and puting their parts in a <HI>vibrating</HI>
Motion; as also Bodies act upon <HI>Light,</HI> in
drawing its parts to them, and that in Lines
<HI>perpendicular</HI> to their Surfaces: All the dif∣ferently
<HI>reflexible Light,</HI> observes this one
Law, that all the different <HI>Angles</HI> of <HI>In∣cidences</HI>
are respectively equal to the <HI>An∣gles</HI>
of <HI>Reflexion;</HI> and all the differently
<HI>Refrangible</HI> Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> observe one
Law likewise, <HI>viz.</HI> that in all the <HI>obli∣quities</HI>
of the same Ray, to the Plane of
<HI>Incidence,</HI> the <HI>Sines</HI> of the <HI>Angles</HI> of <HI>In∣cidence,</HI>
are to the <HI>Sines</HI> of the <HI>Angles</HI> of
<HI>Refraction</HI> in a constant <HI>ratio;</HI> and both
these Properties proceed from one, and
the same Principle, acting in different
Circumstances, <HI>viz.</HI> that Bodies attract
<HI>Light</HI> in <HI>Lines perpendicular</HI> to their Sur∣faces,
and that this attraction is equal in
all the <HI>Incidences,</HI> and <HI>Refractions</HI> at equal
Distances from the same <HI>Plane,</HI> and the
<PB N="195" REF="346"/>
<HI>reflected</HI> Rays are turn'd back before they
arrive at the <HI>reflecting</HI> Plane: For if the
<HI>reflecting</HI> Plane, have such a force of <HI>at∣traction,</HI>
that before the Ray arrives at it,
it has already made the <HI>Sine</HI> of the <HI>Angle</HI>
of <HI>Incidence,</HI> equal to the <HI>Radius,</HI> the
Ray must reflect, and not fall upon the
reflecting Plane at all; if a lesser degree
of <HI>attraction,</HI> then must it enter the Body
of the Plane, and proceed in the Line,
that its direct <HI>impulse,</HI> together with the
degree of <HI>attraction</HI> in the <HI>refracting</HI> Body,
necessarily generates. And as there are
different degrees of <HI>Attraction</HI> in Bodies,
which produce their different degrees of
<HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Cohesion,</HI> so there must be
different degrees of <HI>attraction</HI> in <HI>Mediums,</HI>
suppos'd, to account for their different
<HI>Powers,</HI> in bringing the <HI>refracted</HI> Rays
nearer to or farther from, the <HI>perpendicu∣lar;</HI>
for it's well known, all <HI>Mediums</HI>
have not the same <HI>refractive</HI> Virtue. Now
what a beautiful, uniform, and simple
<HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> is here? this is so very
like the <HI>frugal simplicity,</HI> and yet the <HI>ma∣nifold
<PB N="196" REF="347"/>
variety</HI> of Nature, that one would
be almost tempted to believe it true,
were there no <HI>Demonstration</HI> and Experi∣ment
to confirm the truth of it. I might
likewise shew here the Art and Contrivance
of Nature, in the production of the <HI>Cohe∣sion</HI>
of Bodies. But having been pretty
copious on this Subject already, I shall
only suggest one very remarkable Instance
of the wonderful Contrivance and Wis∣dom
of Nature, in the <HI>propagation</HI> of
<HI>Light, viz.</HI> that a Ray of <HI>Light,</HI> in pas∣sing
from a luminous Point, through two
differently <HI>refracting Mediums,</HI> to illumi∣nate
a given Point; spends the least time
(the refracting Powers of the several <HI>Me∣diums</HI>
considered) possible, and conse∣quently
when the Ray passes, but through
one and the same <HI>Medium, i. e.</HI> when a
Ray passes from a luminous Point, to re∣flect
upon a given Point, it takes the shor∣test
way possible. This the <HI>Geometers</HI>
have demonstrated, and particularly, Mr.
<HI>Hugens</HI> in his Treatise of <HI>Light,</HI> very ele∣gantly
<HI>Page</HI> 40 <HI>and</HI> 41. Now I appeal
<PB N="197" REF="348"/>
to the Reader, how <HI>incredulous</HI> soever, if
this be not an Instance of <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>De∣sign,</HI>
is not this like the Methods of <HI>Pru∣dence</HI>
and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which will not spend
more time on a thing, than just what is
necessary to do the Business; which will
not go about, but take the shortest Course
possible, that will bring it to the Place de∣sign'd?
He that can resist such pregnant
and powerful Instances of Divine Wisdom,
will never be convinc'd.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. I shou'd next proceed, to
shew the wonders in the <HI>Bowels</HI> of our
<HI>Earth,</HI> but our Discoveries are so few,
and our accounts of this matter, so lame,
that nothing certain can be determin'd a∣bout
these <HI>Inner Regions.</HI> Some have con∣cluded
that there must of Necessity be a
Central heat, because they saw that Springs
run faster in Frost and Snow, than in
hot Weather, but that might proceed
from some of the other more narrow <HI>out∣lets</HI>
of this <HI>Bason</HI>'s being stopt, by the Frost;
and the <HI>Vapours</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> raises thence,
being kept in. Others have thought that
<PB N="198" REF="349"/>
within this outer Crust of <HI>Earth,</HI> there
must be a <HI>Discontinuity,</HI> for some conside∣rable
distance, quite round, and that
there was succeeding this, a large <HI>Sphere,</HI>
moving after a certain manner, to account
for the <HI>variation</HI> of the <HI>Magnet;</HI> but I am
of Opinion the Causes of this <HI>variation</HI> is
to be sought in the <HI>Magnet</HI> it self, and
not in so remote and so far fetch'd a Cause;
for it seems pretty odd, that a <HI>Sphere</HI>
shou'd be made, to whirl within the <HI>Bow∣els</HI>
of the <HI>Earth,</HI> to make a <HI>Peeble</HI> turn
this or the other way above Ground. If
the <HI>Earth</HI> were an universal <HI>Magnet</HI> (as
it's commonly but erroneously believ'd)
then the parts might follow the Nature of
the whole. But tho' it attracts Bodies, as
well as the <HI>Loadstone</HI> does, yet it's after a∣nother
manner, and from a different Law.
One might as probably expect a different
turn and figure of internal <HI>Orbs,</HI> to ac∣count
for the Effects and Vertues of seve∣ral
others of the <HI>Metals, Minerals</HI> and <HI>va∣rious
Fossils,</HI> and of many other <HI>Electrick</HI>
Bodies, different from the <HI>Loadstone,</HI> as
<PB N="199" REF="350"/>
of their Brother the <HI>Magnet.</HI> I believe an
<HI>Hypothesis</HI> may be form'd, whereupon by
the figure and size of its parts in regard of
Bodies attracted, this and the <HI>variation</HI> of
its direction might be accounted for; but
this is not a proper Place for these things.
As for the analogy between these inter∣nal
<HI>Orbs,</HI> and that of the <HI>Annulus</HI> of <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI>
I cannot think it holds, the one be∣ing
exteriour the other interiour; the one
a whole <HI>Sphere,</HI> the other a <HI>Ring</HI> only:
Neither can I think that this <HI>Annulus</HI> can
be some remains of the Ruins of a Crust,
that is fall'n in upon the Body of the
<HI>Planet,</HI> because this <HI>Ring</HI> appears to be
regular and uniform, of an equal breadth
quite round, and at an equal distance
from the Body of the <HI>Planet;</HI> besides, it
is scarcely probable that these <HI>Planets,</HI>
which like ours, may be design'd for the
Habitation of some sort of <HI>Animals,</HI> shou'd
be so ruinous as this Supposition wou'd
make that <HI>Planet</HI> to be. Lastly, all these
<HI>Hypotheses</HI> have not that simplicity, and
artfulness, that the Works of Nature and
<PB N="200" REF="351"/>
Truth carry along with them. If it be true
that all the Bodies of the Universe <HI>attract</HI>
one another, then it's very plain that
when ever a lesser Body (however figur'd)
attends the Motions of, and revolves with
a greater, that that lesser Body is design'd
by it's <HI>attraction,</HI> to produce some effect,
that is the Consequent of this <HI>Attraction.</HI>
Thus it's plain, our <HI>Moon</HI> was design'd to
raise our <HI>Tides,</HI> and regular Winds, and
to disturb the Motions of our <HI>Earth,</HI> for
Purposes that possibly we may, or may
never, come to discover; and so the <HI>Sa∣tellits</HI>
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> were design'd
to attract, the Fluids, or disorder the
Motions of their respective <HI>Planets;</HI> and
I have suggested before, that the Multi∣tude
of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of these <HI>Planets</HI> may
serve in their vast distance from the <HI>Sun,</HI>
to hinder their Fluids (by frequent and
various Disturbance) from freezing; and
the greater number of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI>
than <HI>Jupiter,</HI> seems to favour this
Conjecture. Now this <HI>Annulus</HI> may possi∣bly
serve some such purpose as this, since
<PB N="201" REF="352"/>
it moves differently from the Body it self.
But all these are but Conjectures on both
sides; and as such I leave 'em. It's cer∣tain
that <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and <HI>Vulcano's,</HI> pro∣ceed
from some Motion and Mixture of
different Particles within the Body of the
<HI>Earth;</HI> it is likewise certain that its <HI>Strata,</HI>
are not of such Gravities as a regular sub∣sidence
according to the Laws of Gravi∣tation
of Bodies, wou'd require; which
shews it has not been compounded by
these Laws. It's likewise certain, that
we have fresh Water at any considerable
depth, in most Places distant from the <HI>Sea;</HI>
we have from its <HI>Bowels,</HI> all our <HI>Metals</HI>
and <HI>Minerals,</HI> with all their Varieties,
which is of so much use, for the Accom∣modations
of <HI>Life,</HI> and the subservience
of <HI>Medicine;</HI> from the depths of the <HI>Sea,</HI>
and the <HI>Bowels</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> we have all
our natural <HI>Salts,</HI> which do us so great
and manifold Services. If any one had
but occasion, to look over, the variety,
beautiful Figures, and Colours, of <HI>Shells,
Petrifactions, Ores, Minerals,</HI> and <HI>Stones,</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="353"/>
which <HI>Industry</HI> has collected, he cou'd not
but admire the <HI>manifold Wisdom</HI> of the
Author of Nature. This were a very large
and copious Field, and wou'd afford very
<HI>demonstrative</HI> Instances of <HI>Counsel</HI> and
<HI>Contrivance.</HI> But I have so many other
things to suggest on the Head I am about,
that I must content my self with <HI>Gene∣rals.</HI></P>
<P>§ XXXIII. Having dwelt so long up∣on
the <HI>inanimate</HI> part of this <HI>Systeme</HI> of
things, I come now to consider the <HI>Animal</HI>
Kingdom; that <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>manifest Repre∣sentation</HI>
of the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the
<HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI> One of <HI>Democritus</HI> or
<HI>Des Cartes</HI>'s Disciples, may perhaps un∣dertake,
to give some faint and imperfect
kind of Explication of the <HI>Celestial</HI> Ap∣pearances,
from their <HI>Principles,</HI> tho' how
wretched their accounts of this Matter are,
we have in some measure already shewn.
But when they come to a <HI>Plant,</HI> or <HI>Ani∣mal,</HI>
they are perfectly at a loss, they
can produce nothing coherent, or of a
peice; their <HI>Schemes</HI> then, are like the
<PB N="203" REF="354"/>
effects of the casual <HI>concourse</HI> of <HI>Atoms,</HI> an
odd inconsistent Mixture of things, that
has neither Form, nor Beauty. For ev'ry
part of these, is so exactly adapted, to
some wise <HI>Design,</HI> ev'ry thing is so fitted,
to its own proper use; and these Uses
are so manifest and evident, that they
clearly argue, an infinite <HI>Wisdom,</HI> an ex∣act
and exquisite Knowledge, in the Laws
of <HI>Geometry</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> that nothing is
sufficient for, but a <HI>Being</HI> absolutely <HI>per∣fect.</HI>
I shall here, as I did in the <HI>Celestial
Philosophy,</HI> give some general <HI>Scheme,</HI> of
the <HI>Animal Fabrick,</HI> and <HI>Oeconomy;</HI> and
shall confine my <HI>Speculations,</HI> to the <HI>Hu∣mane
Structure,</HI> as being the most perfect,
we are acquainted with, and which being
once fully understood, the rest will ea∣sily
follow. I shall begin with the process
of the <HI>Aliment</HI> and the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the
Blood.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The Meat being grossly
divided, by the Teeth, and softened by
the <HI>Saliva,</HI> is through the <HI>Gullet,</HI> by the
Constriction of its <HI>Fibres,</HI> thrust into the
<PB N="204" REF="355"/>
<HI>Stomach;</HI> where being swell'd and farther
softned by the <HI>Succus</HI> of its <HI>Glands,</HI> and
the Liquors taken in, by the perpetual
Motion of the Coats of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> a∣gainst
one another, the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the
<HI>Midriff</HI> and <HI>Abdomen</HI> employed in respira∣tion,
its parts are broken, and their inti∣mate
Cohesions dissolv'd. And by this
<HI>pressure</HI> of the sides of the <HI>Stomach</HI> upon
the contain'd <HI>Aliment,</HI> it is thrust into the
<HI>Intestins;</HI> at its entry into which, it is irri∣gated
with the <HI>Bile</HI> and <HI>Sweetbread-juice,</HI>
the one to sweeten, the other to dilute
the <HI>Chyle,</HI> by the <HI>vermicular</HI> Motion of
the <HI>Intestins</HI> (arising from the alternate
Action of their <HI>Spiral</HI> and <HI>Longitudinar
Fibres</HI>) the <HI>pressure</HI> of the <HI>Midriff</HI> and the
<HI>Muscles</HI> of the lower Belly, the grosser
parts are deriv'd downward, to be thrust
out of the Body, while the finer, are
squeez'd into the narrow <HI>Orifices</HI> of the
<HI>lacteal</HI> Vessels, which open into these <HI>in∣testines;</HI>
whence in slender Chanels they
are carried into the <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Mesen∣tery,</HI>
receiving first a fine thin <HI>Lymph</HI> from
<PB N="205" REF="356"/>
the <HI>Lpmphatick</HI> Ducts which dilutes this
<HI>Chylous</HI> fluid, and scours its containing
Vessels, which from the <HI>Mesenterick Glands</HI>
unite in larger Channels, and pass directly
into the common <HI>Receptacle</HI> of the <HI>Chyle,</HI>
which is a Bason, form'd for it by the U∣nion
of these <HI>Lacteal,</HI> and <HI>Lymphatick</HI>
Vessels; from thence in one Duct, it as∣cends
into the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and about the
Heart sometimes dividing, it immediately
unites again, and creeping along the <HI>Gul∣let,</HI>
it passes on to the left <HI>Subclavian</HI>
Vein, where in one or two Mouths, it
opens into that Vessel, and there mixes
with the Blood, and <HI>circulates</HI> with it,
which <HI>Circulation</HI> is thus perform'd. The
Veins (in a continued Channel with the
<HI>Arteries,</HI>) bring the Blood from the Ex∣tremities
of the Body, and all uniting in
two large Vessels, whose sides diverge,
form the <HI>Vena Cava, Ascendens</HI> and <HI>De∣scendens,</HI>
which two likewise join at their
entry into the right Ear of the Heart,
which in its <HI>Relaxation</HI> or <HI>Diastole,</HI> re∣ceives
the Blood from them, and in its
<PB N="206" REF="357"/>
constriction or <HI>Systole,</HI> thrusts it into the
right <HI>Ventricle,</HI> which is then its state of
Remission: which when contracted, drives
it through the <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis,</HI> into
the <HI>Lungs;</HI> whence it is receiv'd, in an
uninterrupted Channel, by the <HI>Vena Pul∣monalis,</HI>
and is carried into the left <HI>Auri∣cle</HI>
of the Heart, then open to receive it;
by whose constriction, it is discharged in∣to
the left <HI>Ventricle</HI> then likewise dilated,
by whose contraction it is pushed into the
<HI>Aorta,</HI> which bending a little upwards,
sends forth the <HI>Cervical</HI> and <HI>Axillary Ar∣teries,</HI>
the rest turning down again, forms
the descending Trunk, and these dividing
into innumerable lesser Channels, carry
the Blood to the several parts of the Bo∣dy,
where leaving some of its Particles
proper for their use; the rest is sent into
the <HI>Veins,</HI> which are nothing but the re∣turning
<HI>Arteries;</HI> and thus the Blood is
carried about in a perpetual <HI>Circle,</HI> from
the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the <HI>Veins,</HI> and from these
to those; and in this <HI>Circulation,</HI> duly
perform'd, Life and Health consist.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="358"/>
§ XXXV. As it is plain from what
has been said, that it is only the Blood,
that is recruited by the <HI>Chyle,</HI> so is it like∣wise
evident from thence, that it is only from
the Blood, that all the Expences of living
are furnished, and that all the <HI>Secretions</HI>
of what kind soever are deriv'd. Now
these <HI>Secretions,</HI> are made by the assistance
of the <HI>Glands▪</HI> and a <HI>Gland</HI> is nothing
but the <HI>Convolution</HI> or various folding, of
the <HI>Evanescent Artery,</HI> whose last Bran∣ches
must be <HI>Cylindrical.</HI> This <HI>Cylindrical
Artery,</HI> in its windings, sends out several
little Ducts, of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> which
sometimes unite in one common <HI>Pore,</HI>
sometimes run into a common <HI>Bason.</HI>
This Structure is evident, in all the larger
and more conspicuous <HI>Glands,</HI> such as the
<HI>Intestins</HI> with their Secretory Ducts, the
<HI>Lacteals,</HI> the <HI>Testicles,</HI> and some of the
<HI>Conglobat Glands;</HI> and may be seen in all
the rest if they happen to be obstructed,
and so swell to become visible. And
therefore the same is reasonably to be
concluded of all the <HI>Glands;</HI> since
<PB N="208" REF="359"/>
Nature is constant and uniform in her A∣ctions,
and produces similar Effects by si∣milar
Instruments. Now the Nature of
the <HI>Secretions</HI> themselves depend upon
these three things. 1. The different <HI>Dia∣meter</HI>
of the <HI>Orifice</HI> of these <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts,
whereby Particles of a <HI>Diameter,</HI> greater
than that of this Duct, are excluded.
2. The different <HI>Angle,</HI> which this Duct
makes, with the Trunk of the <HI>Artery;</HI> for
it is already demonstrated, that all Fluids
press the sides of the containing Vessel,
and that in a direction <HI>perpendicular</HI> to
these sides; and this is evident in the <HI>pul∣sation</HI>
of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> since it is, to that
<HI>pressure,</HI> this <HI>pulsation</HI> is owing. It is like∣wise
evident that the Blood is urg'd for∣ward
by the Force of the Heart, so that
the Motion of <HI>Secretion</HI> must be compoun∣ded
of both these Motions. Now tho'
this <HI>lateral pressure,</HI> is greater, when the
<HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>longitudinal</HI> Motion is so,
yet it is not in the proportion of this <HI>Ve∣locity;</HI>
for this <HI>pressure</HI> is always some what
even, when the Fluid is at rest, and is
<PB N="209" REF="360"/>
then in <HI>proportion,</HI> to the <HI>Specifick</HI> Gravi∣ty
of the Fluid, nothing else being in this
Fluid to produce this <HI>pressure,</HI> and in a
Fluid urg'd by a <HI>Longitudinal</HI> Direction,
as the Blood in the <HI>Arteries,</HI> this lateral
<HI>pressure,</HI> is in a compound Proportion of
both; whence it is evident that if two
Particles of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> but of une∣qual
<HI>specifick</HI> Gravities, arrive with the
same <HI>Velocity,</HI> at an <HI>Orifice</HI> capable of ad∣mitting
either of 'em, yet they will not
both pass, because their <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Dire∣ction</HI>
is different: So that this Diversity in
the <HI>Angles,</HI> these <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts make with
the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the <HI>Artery,</HI> seems altogether
necessary to account for the possible Diver∣sities
of secern'd Fluids, ev'n admitting their
<HI>Diameters,</HI> and Figures, to be the same.
For it is not to be doubted, that the Blood
is a <HI>Hetrogeneous</HI> Fluid, and contains parts
of different <HI>Specifick</HI> Gravities, different
Cohesions, and of different Densities; and
the separated Fluid must be <HI>Homogeneous</HI>
to perform the uniform Functions of Life.
3. The different <HI>Velocities,</HI> with which
<PB N="210" REF="361"/>
the Blood arrives, at the <HI>Orifices</HI> of these
<HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts, for since the <HI>Secretions</HI> are
made in form of a Fluid, there is no pos∣sible
Reason can be assign'd, why some
<HI>Animals</HI> are of a soft loose Texture, and
Union of solid Parts, and why one part
of the Body is of a tender, loose, easily
separable Texture; others of an harder,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer, and more close Cohesion, but this
different <HI>Velocity</HI> of the Blood, at the <HI>Ori∣fices</HI>
of the separatory Ducts. And tho'
the Diversity of the <HI>Diameters</HI> of these
Ducts, is certainly that which is of grea∣test
<HI>Moment</HI> in this Affair of <HI>Secretion,</HI> yet
it is impossible to account, for the <HI>simila∣rity</HI>
of the secern'd Fluids from so <HI>Hetero∣geneous</HI>
a Fluid, as the Blood is, from this a∣lone.
For suppose, (as my worthy and lear∣ned
Friend Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> has very justly rea∣soned)
the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of
<HI>Ʋrin, Gall</HI> and <HI>Semen,</HI> to be as 1, 2, 3. The
<HI>Diameters</HI> of the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts, of the
<HI>Kidneys, Liver</HI> and <HI>Testicles,</HI> must be in
the same <HI>Proportions.</HI> Now tho' upon this
supposition of only different <HI>Diameters,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="362"/>
the Particles of <HI>Gall</HI> and <HI>Semen</HI> cannot be
separated in the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> yet the Parti∣cles
of <HI>Ʋrine</HI> and <HI>Gall</HI> may be separated
by the <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts of the <HI>Testicles,</HI>
the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of these
Fluids, being by supposition, less than
that of the <HI>Diameter</HI> of the <HI>Excretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Testicles.</HI> So that upon
this supposition of only different <HI>Diame∣ters,</HI>
it is impossible to account, for the
<HI>Homogeneity</HI> or <HI>similarity</HI> of the <HI>secerned</HI>
Liquors: for all the Particles of whatever
kind, that are less than the <HI>Diameter</HI> of
the <HI>Secretory</HI> Duct, must be indifferently
separated there. But from this general
view of the Nature and Manner of <HI>Secre∣tions,</HI>
the particular ones may be under∣stood.
<HI>Nutrition</HI> is perform'd by a <HI>Secretory</HI>
Duct, arising from the terminating <HI>Artery,</HI>
which carries a suitable Portion of the
Blood, to every part to be nourished, so
that ev'ry point in the Body, must be the
<HI>termination</HI> of a <HI>Secretory</HI> Duct; through
which a proper part of the Blood is
brought. The Blood being brought by
<PB N="212" REF="363"/>
the <HI>Arteries</HI> to the Brain, the <HI>Capillary</HI>
parts of these <HI>Arteries</HI> by innumerable <HI>con∣volutions,</HI>
form innumerable little <HI>Glands,</HI>
of which it's <HI>Cortical</HI> part consists; in these
<HI>Glands,</HI> the finer, and more subtile, <HI>Acid</HI>
Particles of the Blood, are separated,
and log'd in the slender small <HI>Tubes</HI> of the
<HI>Medullary</HI> parts, which are the beginning
of the <HI>Nerves.</HI> These <HI>Nerves</HI> are Bundles
of fine small Pipes, arising from these in∣finitely
many little <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Cineri∣tious</HI>
part of the Brain; and terminating
in all the points of the Body; so that
properly, they are only the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts
of these little <HI>Glands,</HI> and the <HI>Secretory
Pores</HI> of the <HI>repositories</HI> of the Animal Spi∣rits;
they are hollow but extreamly small,
so that tho' the Spirits move in them after
the same manner, and by the same <HI>Mecha∣nism,</HI>
the Blood <HI>circulates</HI> through the <HI>Ar∣teries,</HI>
yet by reason of the many <HI>convo∣lutions</HI>
of the <HI>Evanescent Arteries,</HI> which
form their original <HI>Glands</HI> in the Brain,
to which they are <HI>Excretories;</HI> And the
slenderness of their <HI>Muscular</HI> Coats, the
<PB N="213" REF="364"/>
exceeding smallness of their <HI>Cavities,</HI> and
their distance from the Heart; the <HI>Veloci∣ty</HI>
of their Motion, in respect of that of
the Blood, is very much abated; however
this slow Motion keeps 'em very near full,
and when these <HI>Tubes</HI> are quite full of
this <HI>nervous</HI> Fluid, the <HI>Animal</HI> is active
and watchful; when they are near empty, it
is languid and drowsie; for this Fluid is the
principal concurrent in <HI>Muscular</HI> Motion,
and the immediate <HI>Organ</HI> of <HI>Sensation.</HI> By
the Motion of the <HI>Heart,</HI> through the <HI>E∣mulgent</HI>
Branches, the Blood is brought to
the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> and is there freed of its <HI>Se∣rum,</HI>
by their little <HI>Glands,</HI> and is receiv'd
into the small <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts of these
<HI>Glands,</HI> to be carried into the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> and
thence by proper <HI>Tubes</HI> into the <HI>Bladder.</HI>
Much after the same manner, are their
proper Fluids separated from the Blood
in the <HI>Liver, Sweetbread, Testicles,</HI> and
the other <HI>Conglobat</HI> and <HI>Conglomerate
Glands</HI> of the Body, so that it is needless
to insist on these.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="365"/>
§ XXXVI. The <HI>Lungs</HI> are compos'd
of an infinite number of little <HI>Lobes,</HI> of
different Figures, and Magnitudes, but
so join'd as to leave but small Vacuities
between 'em. Each <HI>Lobe</HI> consists of an
infinity of small <HI>spherical Vesicles,</HI> form'd
by the Coats of the small Branches of the
<HI>Trachea;</HI> so that they may be considered
(when blown up) as so many fine <HI>Tubes</HI>
ending in little hollow <HI>Spheres;</HI> upon the
sides of these <HI>Vesicles,</HI> the Blood Vessels
in a fine <HI>Net-work</HI> are spread. Now before
the <HI>foetus</HI> is brought to Light, these <HI>Ve∣sicles</HI>
lie flat upon one another, and by
their <HI>pressure</HI> upon the Blood Vessels, hin∣der
its progress through them; but as soon
as this <HI>foetus</HI> enjoys the benefit of the Air,
by its weight and <HI>elastick</HI> Force, this Air
rushes in through the Pipes of the <HI>Trache<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
into these <HI>Vesicles,</HI> and blows 'em up,
whereby they stand erect upon the <HI>Trunks</HI>
of these little <HI>Wind-pipes,</HI> and give a free
passage to the Blood through these Ves∣sels,
spread upon their sides. And when
by the weight of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and the
<PB N="215" REF="366"/>
Action of the Muscles thereof, with those
of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and <HI>Midriff,</HI> this <HI>elastick</HI>
Fluid is thrust out of the <HI>Vesicles,</HI> through
the <HI>Trachea</HI> in <HI>Expiration</HI> these <HI>Vesicles</HI>
pressing against one another, and the <HI>ela∣stick</HI>
Fluid acting upon the sides of them,
and consequently, on the Blood Vessels
spread thereon, separate the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the Blood, which had Room and Liberty
to unite in the wider Channels of the
<HI>Veins;</HI> and by this separation of these
<HI>Globules</HI> of the Blood, from one another,
renders it more capable to <HI>circulate,</HI> in the
more narrow passages of the <HI>Capillary</HI> Ves∣sels.
But, if I be not very much mista∣ken,
there is still a more considerable use
of this natural <HI>Function</HI> behind, and that
is to form these <HI>elastick Globules</HI> of which
the Blood principally consists. It is un∣doubted
Matter of Fact and observation,
that the Blood consists of a <HI>Lymph,</HI> which
is the common <HI>Vehicle,</HI> several <HI>Salts, Ra∣menta</HI>
of a thick consistence, (which is
probably the unform'd part of the <HI>Chyle,</HI>
and Aliment) and these red <HI>Globules,</HI> of
<PB N="216" REF="367"/>
we are now speaking; but sometimes
they are of different Colours, as <HI>White,
Blew</HI> and <HI>Purple;</HI> these any body may
discover with an ordinary <HI>Microscope.</HI> Now
it's certain, that these <HI>Globules</HI> may be
burst, as in obstructions; or may be all
exhausted, as in violent <HI>Haemorrhages,</HI> and
yet be all recovered and recruited again;
wherefore it is of necessity, that these <HI>Glo∣bules</HI>
must be form'd somewhere in the
Body from the <HI>Chyle.</HI> And since it's cer∣tain
that they are not solid <HI>Particles,</HI>
both by ocular inspection and touch, and
by the necessity they are under to change
their Figures into oblong <HI>Spheriods,</HI> in
the <HI>capillary</HI> Vessels, as also from their
Colour, and that <HI>Acids</HI> do actually de∣stroy
their Figures, and coagulate these
<HI>Globules;</HI> it is highly probable, they may
be little bubles, blown from the viscid
part of the <HI>Chyle,</HI> by the force of some
more subtile <HI>Elastick Aura.</HI> Now no
Place in the Body, but the <HI>Lungs,</HI> can
afford this <HI>elastick</HI> Fluid; and this may be
<PB N="217" REF="368"/>
the reason why the <HI>Chyle</HI> enters into the
<HI>Veins;</HI> and these too only, which are
just returning immediately to the Heart,
to be sent into the Lungs. For since in
our gross <HI>Eliment</HI> of Air, there is constant∣ly
loged, a finer <HI>Elastick</HI> Fluid, which is
the principal Agent, in all the subtile Ef∣fects
commonly ascrib'd to the other, tho'
the grosser <HI>Eliment</HI> cannot, yet this finer
Fluid, by that vast Force used in <HI>Expira∣tion,</HI>
may be thrust in through the sides of
these <HI>Vesicles,</HI> to the Blood Vessels; and
seeing these Blood <HI>Globules</HI> must be gene∣rated
somewhere, and since there is no
part in the Body, this subtile <HI>Elastick</HI> Fluid
can be squeez'd with sufficient Force, to
get through the sides of the Blood Vessels,
but in the <HI>Lungs;</HI> it seems to me beyond all
doubt, that these <HI>Globules</HI> are form'd there
after this manner: The <HI>viscous</HI> part of the
<HI>Chyle</HI> being by the shortest and safest course
possible, brought into the returning part
of the Blood, is sent from the right <HI>Ven∣tricle</HI>
of the Heart to the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and is
spread upon the sides of the <HI>Vesicles</HI> there∣of
<PB N="218" REF="369"/>
in little fine <HI>Tubes,</HI> this fine <HI>Elastick</HI>
Fluid being squeez'd, in the Act of Ex∣piration,
through a <HI>Pore,</HI> continued through
the <HI>Vesicle</HI> of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and the side of
the Blood Vessels, is forc'd into the <HI>vis∣cous</HI>
part of the <HI>Chyle,</HI> which is runing
by in the <HI>Serum,</HI> and by its <HI>perpendicular
pressure</HI> upon the sides of that Cavity it
forms, produces a small little <HI>buble,</HI> of a
certain magnitude, and thickness of Shell,
from whence it has its Colour, and by
the force of the succeeding Fluid, this lit∣tle
<HI>buble</HI> is broken off from the <HI>Pore,</HI> and
carried along the <HI>Artery,</HI> and the <HI>Cohesion</HI>
of the parts of the Shell of this <HI>buble,</HI> being
greater than the force from without, whereby
the thin <HI>Serum</HI> acts upon it, it is preserv'd in
its figure in all the various Motions of the
compound Fluid of the Blood; and if it
happen that these little <HI>bubles</HI> shou'd be
burst, (as they most certainly are by a
thousand Causes) when ever they come
to the <HI>Lungs,</HI> they are new-form'd again,
whereby the <HI>circulation</HI> is rendred constant
and uniform. For shou'd these <HI>Globules</HI> be
<PB N="219" REF="370"/>
all destroyed, there must of necessity arise
a general Obstruction in all the <HI>Capillary Ar∣teries.</HI>
The manner of the Production of
these little <HI>bubles,</HI> in the Blood by the <HI>Ela∣stick,</HI>
Fluid, forc'd through the sides of the
<HI>Vesicles,</HI> and Blood Vessels in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> is so
obvious, that I shall insist no farther upon it,
since ev'ry body may see an instance of the
same Nature, in mixing Oil with Vinegar,
the Substance of which Mixture, when
view'd, but with an ordinary <HI>Microscope,</HI>
appears to be nothing but an <HI>infinity</HI> of
such like little <HI>bubles,</HI> form'd by the im∣mission
of the Air, and Vinegar, into lit∣tle
Shells of Oil. But from this one Prin∣ciple,
many of the despair'd of Appea∣rances,
in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> may be
made easie; and a thousand Difficulties
about the Causes of Diseases, and the
manner of the Operation of <HI>Medicines</HI> va∣nish.
And this makes it look the more like
truth, Nature being frugal in her Princi∣ples,
but various in the effects thence ari∣sing.
But it being both foreign to my
Design, and unfit for the Limits I have
<PB N="220" REF="371"/>
prescrib'd to my self, to deduce all the
<HI>Corollaries</HI> thence arising, I shall instance
but in one Particular, and leave the rest
to another Occasion.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. A <HI>Muscle,</HI> as I have hin∣ted
§ XIII. of the preceding Chapter,
is only a bundle of <HI>Fibres,</HI> of which all
in the same Plane run <HI>parallel;</HI> the fleshy
part of the <HI>Muscles</HI> is spongious, soft and
lax; the <HI>tendinous,</HI> is only the fleshy part
compacted, the <HI>Fibrils</HI> of the one are di∣vided
into innumerable little <HI>orbicular</HI>
Cells, form'd of two concave <HI>Segments</HI> of a
<HI>Sphere;</HI> those of the other, are hard and
solid; these make the Head and Tail,
which are always inserted into some solid
places of the Body; as to those of the Bel∣ly
of the <HI>Muscles,</HI> each <HI>Fibre</HI> consists of
an infinite number of little <HI>Fibrils,</HI> ty'd
together by transverse small Threads,
which go from <HI>Fibre</HI> to <HI>Fibre,</HI> and are
call'd <HI>Membranous Fibres;</HI> into those <HI>orbi∣cular</HI>
Cells, enter an <HI>Artery, Vein</HI> and
<HI>Nerve,</HI> the first and second, to bring and
carry back the Blood, the latter to let in
<PB N="221" REF="372"/>
(upon any Impression communicated to it)
its own proper Juice. Now it's very proba∣ble
from its <HI>Acid</HI> taste, that this <HI>nervous</HI> Juice,
consists of Particles which are pointed and
fit to break the <HI>Shells</HI> of the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the Blood. And upon an immission of this
Liquid of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> into the <HI>orbicular</HI>
Cells of <HI>muscular Fibres,</HI> the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the Blood may be actually broken, and
so leave the imprisoned <HI>Elastick Aura,</HI> to
escape; by which means, these little <HI>ela∣stick,</HI>
Cells of the <HI>Fibres</HI> must of necessity
be blown up. And thereby their <HI>Longi∣tudinal
Diameters,</HI> from Cell to Cell strait∣ned:
which wou'd contract the length of
the whole <HI>Fibre,</HI> and so move that <HI>Organ</HI>
to which one of the <HI>tendons</HI> is fixt. This
is undoubtedly the true manner of <HI>muscu∣lar</HI>
Motion, and agreeable to the learned
Mr. <HI>John Bernoulli</HI>'s Doctrine on this
Head. And consequently, all the <HI>Geo∣metrical
Theorems</HI> he has discovered a∣bout
<HI>muscular</HI> Motion, are now actual
<HI>Theory,</HI> and Matter of Fact. But I shall
have an occasion of speaking of these after∣wards.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="373"/>
Only now, The place of the Pro∣duction
of these <HI>Globules,</HI> and their Na∣ture
being thus determin'd, <HI>a priori,</HI> is a
very evident demonstration of the true
Cause of <HI>muscular</HI> Motion, which has
been long thought uncapable of being
explain'd. The broken Shells of these
<HI>Globules,</HI> are carried back by the <HI>Veins</HI>
to the <HI>Lungs,</HI> to be new-form'd, which
is the reason that <HI>muscular</HI> Motion is so
constantly and uniformly perform'd, so
long as the <HI>Blood Globules,</HI> and <HI>Animal Spi∣rits</HI>
are in sufficient plenty. For the Mo∣tion
of the Joints and Limbs the <HI>Bones</HI>
which are the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the Body, are <HI>ar∣ticulated</HI>
one into another, and the one
Extremity of the <HI>Muscle,</HI> is fastned to some
solid part, and the other to the <HI>Bone,</HI>
that is to move beyond its <HI>Articulation.</HI>
So that the length of the <HI>Muscle</HI> being
shortned, the moveable Bone, must be
drawn toward the fixt Extremity, accord∣ing
to the Manner and Determination, of
the <HI>Articulation.</HI> Thus the Motions of all
<PB N="223" REF="374"/>
the more solid parts of the Body are per∣form'd.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The Fluids of the Body
are principally propell'd, by the Action of
the Heart, and the <HI>elastick</HI> Force of the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of the containing Vessels. Now
the Heart is a <HI>Muscle,</HI> like other <HI>Muscles,</HI>
consisting of several Orders of fleshy <HI>Fi∣bres,</HI>
of different Directions, it has two
little <HI>Ears</HI> and as many <HI>Ventricles,</HI> which
are Cavities for receiving or holding the
Blood, as it comes from the several Ves∣sels,
or is to be driven to different Places.
The <HI>Fibres</HI> of this <HI>Muscle,</HI> act by the
<HI>Longitudinal Diameters</HI> of its <HI>Muscular</HI>
Cells being shortned, and so by the win∣ding
and spiral Direction of its several
Orders of <HI>Fibres,</HI> the Cavities of the <HI>Ears</HI>
and <HI>Ventricles</HI> are lessen'd or constring'd.
And it is observable that all the <HI>Muscular
Fibres</HI> of the Coats of the Vessels, act af∣ter
the manner already explain'd. But
the <HI>Membranous</HI> Coats, meerly by their
own <HI>Elasticity,</HI> being stretch'd first by ex∣ternal
<PB N="224" REF="375"/>
Violence. Thus the sides of all <HI>Mem∣branes</HI>
are bent or press'd outward by some
included Fluid, but restore 'emselves by
their own natural Elasticity; whereas
when ever a Coat consists of <HI>Fibres</HI> of
whatever kind, excepting those for <HI>Sen∣sation</HI>
or <HI>Nutrition,</HI> it is a sure <HI>Indication</HI>
that this Coat acts as a <HI>Muscle;</HI> for Na∣ture
does nothing in vain, and wou'd ne∣ver
have distinguish'd a Coat into <HI>Fibres,</HI>
but for <HI>Muscular</HI> Action, when a conti∣nued
<HI>Membranous,</HI> or <HI>Tendinous</HI> one, is more
capable of acting by its own <HI>Elasticity.</HI> So
that the Nature of the Coats, and of their
constituent <HI>Fibres,</HI> of the Channels, being
known, together with the Range and Di∣rection
of these <HI>Fibres,</HI> it is easie to know
the manner of their operating upon the
included Fluid. The Coats of the <HI>Gullet</HI>
are three, the outermost <HI>Membranous,</HI> the
second fleshy and <HI>Muscular,</HI> turning ob∣liquely
from the uppermost end of the <HI>Oe∣sophagus</HI>
to the <HI>Stomach;</HI> the third, is
tendinous and <HI>muscular,</HI> of white slender
<HI>Fibres</HI> diversely interwoven. The <HI>Stomach</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="376"/>
has four Coats, the innermost is Carpet-like,
of white short tendinous <HI>Fibres</HI> stan∣ding
<HI>perpendicular</HI> upon the next Coat,
which is <HI>nervous</HI> and extreamly sensible;
the third is fleshy and <HI>Muscular,</HI> of straight
and circular <HI>Fibres;</HI> the fourth <HI>Membra∣nous</HI>
from the <HI>Peritonaeum.</HI> The <HI>Guts</HI> con∣sist
of three Coats, the innermost is of the
same nature with that of the innermost
of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> the second is of two
Orders of <HI>Muscular Fibres, Longitudinal</HI>
and <HI>Spiral,</HI> the third is common and <HI>mem∣branous,</HI>
arising likewise from the <HI>Peri∣tonaeum.</HI>
The <HI>Nerves,</HI> as I have before
said, are a bundle of fine, small, slender
<HI>Pipes,</HI> wherein the Animal Spirits are
treasur'd up for the Expenses of Motion
and <HI>Sensation;</HI> they arise from the <HI>Glands</HI>
of the <HI>cineritious</HI> part of the Brain, and
are terminated in all the points of the Bo∣dy;
ten pair descend immediately through
proper Holes of the <HI>Skull,</HI> and serve the
adjacent Parts, and particularly the <HI>Organs</HI> of
four of the Senses; the rest in a large bun∣dle,
are let down by the Cavity of the
<PB N="226" REF="377"/>
<HI>Vertebrae,</HI> and at fit Places are sent forth
to actuate the several inferiour parts of
the Body. The <HI>Arteries</HI> have three Coats,
the outermost is a fine Web of <HI>Nerves,</HI>
and Blood Vessels, for the nourishment of
these other Coats, and for the <HI>Muscular
Action</HI> of the intermediate one, which is
made up of several <HI>strata</HI> of <HI>Spiral Muscular
Fibres,</HI> according to the bigness of the
<HI>Artery.</HI> The third is a close transparent
<HI>Membrane</HI> very strong and compact, to
keep in the Blood which otherwise upon
the dilatation of the <HI>Artery,</HI> wou'd tear the
<HI>Muscular Fibres</HI> asunder. The <HI>Veins</HI> have
the same Coats with the <HI>Arteries,</HI> only
the <HI>Muscular Spiral Fibres</HI> are thinner, be∣cause
of the lesser force of the Blood a∣gainst
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides of the diverging <HI>Veins,</HI>
than those of the converging <HI>Arteries.</HI>
From this general account of the structure
of the <HI>Vessels,</HI> their Actions upon the in∣closed
Fluid may be easily understood,
the short erected <HI>Fibres</HI> serve for the at∣trition
of the <HI>Aliment,</HI> and for straitning
the Cavity of the <HI>Guts</HI> and <HI>Stomach;</HI> the
<PB N="227" REF="378"/>
<HI>oblique Fibres,</HI> which make but few turns
serve to propagate gently the included
Fluid, the <HI>Longitudinal</HI> ones to move the
Vessel, and the included Fluid, up or
down in a direction <HI>parallel</HI> to its length,
by encreasing this dimension and thereby
lessening the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> the transverse
<HI>Diameter;</HI> the <HI>Spiral</HI> ones by squeezing it
transversely, and so encreasing it in length
or lessening it in breadth. Thus the Blood
being pusht by the contraction of the Heart
into the <HI>Arteries,</HI> distends their Coats a∣long
their whole length, till the force of
the natural <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the <HI>Membranous</HI>
Coat, be equal to the force of this Im∣pulse;
then that <HI>Elasticity</HI> of this Coat be∣ginning
to act, at the same time the <HI>ner∣vous</HI>
Juice is squeez'd out from the <HI>Nerves</HI>
by this dilatation of the small <HI>Arteries,</HI> a∣mong
the <HI>Originating Nerves</HI> in the Brain,
and so brings the <HI>Muscular Fibres</HI> into A∣ction,
after the manner already explain'd.
And both these Forces acting at once,
propell the Blood in a continued Stream,
through the uninterrupted Channels of
<PB N="228" REF="379"/>
the <HI>Veins</HI> and <HI>Arteries.</HI> And the impulse
of the Heart, propagated only by the
<HI>Membranous</HI> Coat, is that which when
felt, is call'd a <HI>Pulse</HI> or <HI>Pulsation</HI> of the <HI>Ar∣tery.</HI></P>
<P>§ XXXIX. All <HI>Sensation</HI> is perform'd
by the immediate Action of the finer and
more fluid parts of Bodies, upon the <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
of Sense; the Impulse communicated
by these subtile parts of Bodies, upon the
<HI>Organs</HI> fitly disposed, is through them
transmitted to the <HI>Nerves,</HI> appropriated
and contriv'd for such a Sense, and through
them to the Brain. Thus in <HI>Vision,</HI> the <HI>Light</HI>
reflected from the Surfaces of Bodies, is
transmitted through the <HI>Humours</HI> of the
Eye, and congregated upon the <HI>Retina,</HI>
in the same manner it was reflected from
the Body, and thereby an Impulse modi∣fied
after a certain manner, strikes the <HI>fi∣laments</HI>
of the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> which con∣vey
this Impulse to the Brain. In <HI>Hear∣ing,</HI>
the Sound after diverse Modifications,
in its passage through the <HI>Meatus Andito∣rius,</HI>
strikes on the <HI>tympanum,</HI> which mo∣ving
<PB N="229" REF="380"/>
the Bones of the Barrel, and they
the inclosed Air of the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> the
<HI>Auditory Nerves</HI> there, are mov'd, after
the same manner they wou'd have been,
had the common Air acted upon them,
with the Advantage of a better qualified
and gentler Impulse than they cou'd have
had otherwise. In <HI>Smelling, Tasting,</HI> and
<HI>Touching,</HI> the <HI>Effluvia</HI> and more subtile
parts of Bodies, act immediately upon the
<HI>Nerves</HI> themselves, and they communi∣cate
this Action to the Brain: So that in
some manner, all <HI>Sensation</HI> is nothing but
<HI>Touching,</HI> several ways diversified. <HI>Gene∣ration</HI>
is nothing but <HI>Accretion,</HI> for it is
beyond all doubt, that all <HI>Generation</HI> is
from a preceding little <HI>Animal</HI> lodged in
the Male. I have demonstrated the <HI>Me∣chanical</HI>
production of <HI>Animals,</HI> to be im∣possible
and unconceivable; there is no∣thing
in an <HI>Animal</HI> but an <HI>infinity</HI> of bran∣ching
and winding Channels, and their
contain'd Fluids, and no Disposition or
Arrangment of either, can produce an
<HI>Animal</HI> since all the parts must be form'd
<PB N="230" REF="381"/>
together, we find some little <HI>bubles,</HI> or
Blood <HI>Globules,</HI> may be form'd out of the
<HI>Chyle</HI> in the Vessels, and one kind of Li∣quor
may be separated from another, out
of the Blood in the <HI>Glands,</HI> and these are
all the Productions an <HI>Animal</HI> is capable of,
which can never reach to that wonderful
Number, and Disposition of parts, an <HI>A∣nimal</HI>
consists of. Now, since it is absurd
to think <HI>God Almighty</HI> is confin'd to a new
Creation, in ev'ry <HI>Generation</HI> of an <HI>Ani∣mal,</HI>
and that these <HI>Animals</HI> themselves are
conspicuous in all Male Seeds; it is plain
that they must have been all created at
once; and lodg'd in the Loyns of the Ori∣ginal
pairs of all the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals.</HI>
Likewise the Fluids, if they did not move
in the Channels of these small <HI>Animals,</HI>
wou'd corrupt and destroy their contain∣ing
Vessels. It's evident then that they
must <HI>circulate</HI> after a manner proper to
'emselves; tho' doubtless the <HI>Velocity</HI> of
their Motions is perfectly accommodated to
the smallness of their <HI>Bulk,</HI> and the slen∣derness
of their solid parts; and since
<PB N="231" REF="382"/>
these Fluids cannot move, without some
insensible <HI>Evacuations</HI> and <HI>Secretions,</HI> this
Loss must be repair'd some way or other.
Wherefore, it is not improbable they
may lurk somewhere in the Male, in
some proper Place, till they be fitted to
be carried off in the soft and tender Fluid
of the <HI>Semen,</HI> to be afterwards log'd in
the Female; where they are fitted with
Accommodations, suited to this Degree of
Growth and Perfection, till they arrive to
the next Period of their Lives; <HI>viz.</HI> to
bear the <HI>Light</HI> and the <HI>Air.</HI> We are cer∣tain
that the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Plants</HI> are nothing
but little <HI>Plants,</HI> perfectly form'd, with
Branches and Leaves duly folded up, and
involv'd in <HI>Membranes,</HI> or surrounded with
<HI>Walls</HI> proper to defend them in this ten∣der
Estate, from external Injuries; and
that <HI>Vegetation</HI> is only the unfolding and
extending of these Branches and Leaves,
by the Force of Juices rais'd by Heat, in
the slender <HI>Tubes</HI> of the <HI>Plant.</HI> We know
that the Eggs of <HI>Animals</HI> are only an <HI>Ʋte∣rus</HI>
for a little <HI>Animal,</HI> furnished with
<PB N="232" REF="383"/>
proper Food, and fenc'd from external
Injuries; and we know likewise that all
the Effects of <HI>incubation,</HI> is supplying a fit
degree of Heat and Warmth, to make
the congeal'd Fluids flow, and more easi∣ly
pass into the nourishing Channels of
the included <HI>Animalcul;</HI> and the Heat of
the <HI>Sun</HI> or of our <HI>Culinary</HI> Fires, when
duly adjusted, produce the same very
Effects with that of the <HI>Females.</HI> We are
sure, that all the several <HI>Transformations</HI>
of <HI>Insects</HI> and other <HI>Animals,</HI> is nothing
but the <HI>Expansion</HI> of their parts, and the
breaking of the <HI>Membranes</HI> that folded 'em
up by the Augmentation of these parts;
that all the several Figures and Shapes
they put on, is owing to the several <HI>Mem∣branes</HI>
they are involv'd in. Now were
there no other Argument, but the <HI>Analogy</HI>
between the manner of the <HI>Generation</HI> and
<HI>Transformations</HI> of these lower, and the
more noble <HI>Animals,</HI> it were sufficient to
persuade any one, who considers the sim∣plicity
and uniformity of Nature in all her
Works. But this, with these already men∣tioned
<PB N="233" REF="384"/>
put it beyond all doubt, that we
are all deriv'd from one <HI>Seed,</HI> and were
once all actually in the Loyns of our first
Parent, and have been ever since, grow∣ing
to our present Estate.</P>
<P>§ XL. From this general view of the
<HI>Structure</HI> of the parts, and of the manner
how the <HI>Animal Functions</HI> are perform'd,
ev'ry body may see how <HI>wonderfully we
are made,</HI> how wisely our several parts are
fitted for their Uses; how justly our Fluids
are contriv'd and dispos'd, to make these
uninterrupted <HI>Circulations</HI> wherein Life
consists; how simple, and yet how suffi∣cient,
the Causes of all those various Mo∣tions,
the <HI>Animal</HI> performs, are. It is
impossible duly to consider these things
without being rapt into admiration of the
infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Divine Architect,</HI>
and contemning the arrogant Pretences of
the <HI>World</HI> and <HI>Animal Wrights,</HI> and much
more the Productions of Chance or justling
<HI>Atoms;</HI> for since even <HI>Mechanism,</HI> assisted
by some kind of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> does
so miserably blunder in the Undertakings
<PB N="234" REF="385"/>
of this Nature (as we may see in all the
<HI>Schemes</HI> of the <HI>Projectors</HI> upon these Heads)
we may be assured <HI>blind Chance</HI> and <HI>jum∣ble</HI>
cou'd never produce so beautiful sim∣ple
and uniform Effects. Cou'd any of our
<HI>mechanical</HI> Undertakers, with all their
skill and cunning, make but an <HI>Insect</HI> or a
<HI>Plant,</HI> with the same Faculties and Qua∣lities
that Nature does; we shou'd begin
to hearken to 'em. But they are so far
from that, that the most exact and nice
Performances of <HI>Art,</HI> come so far short of
the dead <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI> or the <HI>inani∣mate</HI>
Productions of Nature, that a weak
Eye may discover the vast Difference.
Wherefore of unavoidable Necessity, <HI>He
that form'd the Eye must himself see, and
he that made the Ear must himself hear,
and he that indu'd Man with Wisdom must
himself understand;</HI> and he that contriv'd
so wonderfully and wisely, and form'd so
justly and exactly, all things both ani∣mate
and inanimate, must needs <HI>Himself
be.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="386"/>
But I proceed to make some reflections
upon the particular Instances of <HI>Council</HI>
and <HI>Wisdom</HI> in the <HI>Animal</HI> Fabrick.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The Skin with its parts is what
offers itself first; The <HI>Scarfskin</HI> being upper∣most,
is compos'd of several Lays of small
<HI>Scales,</HI> which cover one another more or
less, or lye thicker, according as it, is thicker
in one part of the Body than another;
between these <HI>Scales</HI> the <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts
of the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI> of the true Skin
open. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> reckons that about one
Cuticular <HI>Scale,</HI> 500 such Ducts may lye,
and that a Grain of Sand will cover 250
of these <HI>Scales,</HI> so that one Grain of Sand
will cover 125000 <HI>Orisices</HI> of these <HI>Ex∣cretory</HI>
Ducts. Now what a prodigious
Number of such <HI>Glands</HI> must there be on
the Surface of the whole Body! Into ev'ry
one of these <HI>Glands</HI> an <HI>Artery, Vein</HI> and
<HI>Nerve</HI> do enter; so that we may guess
how prodigious the Number of <HI>Organs</HI> in
an Animal Body must be, from these
that are visible to the Eye assisted with
an ordinary <HI>Microscope.</HI> These <HI>Glands</HI> se∣cern
<PB N="236" REF="387"/>
the Sweat and insensible Perspiration.
And of Necessity they must be many,
since <HI>Sanctorius</HI> observes, that through
them fifteen Ounce weight of a Fluid
passes in 24 Hours. Next under the
<HI>Scarfskin</HI> are the <HI>Papillae Pyramidales,</HI> in∣finite
likewise in Number; they are the
Extremities of the <HI>Nerves</HI> of the <HI>Skin,</HI>
and serve more immediately for the Sense
of <HI>Feeling,</HI> to convey the Impulse receiv'd
along the <HI>Nerves</HI> to the <HI>Brain.</HI> About
these, the <HI>Nerves</HI> and other Vessels make
a fine <HI>Web,</HI> all cover'd over with a mu∣cous
Substance, to moisten these <HI>Papillae
Pyramidales;</HI> and then under this the <HI>Mi∣liary
Glands</HI> themselves are plac'd, protru∣ding
their <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts up, to the Sur∣face
of the <HI>Scarfskin;</HI> upon which there
are many <HI>parallel</HI> Lines, and these inter∣sected
by others, and in each intersection
a Hair is planted. In the <HI>Summer</HI> the
Skin is thinner and softer, in <HI>Winter</HI> more
compact and hard, by reason of the heat
and cold of these different Seasons. The
<HI>Scales</HI> of which the <HI>Scarfskin</HI> is compos'd
<PB N="237" REF="388"/>
is design'd to fence the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the <HI>Se∣cretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Miliary Glands,</HI> and
to hinder Objects from making too pain∣ful
and exquisite an Impression on the
<HI>Nerves,</HI> and to skreen them from exter∣nal
Injuries; the Skin it self is design'd
to wrap up the whole Body, to sustain
and to keep the <HI>Papillae Pyramidales</HI> in
their Places, and the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI> from
being disordered, to receive the Impressi∣ons
of external Objects, and to be the
<HI>Organ</HI> of the Sense of <HI>Touching</HI> and <HI>Feel∣ing.</HI>
Now what can be more wonderfully
contriv'd than this exterior part, if the
<HI>Papillae Pyramidales</HI> or the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI>
had been few and large, then the Inter∣vals
had been without any Sense of <HI>Feel∣ing,</HI>
and so might have been destroy'd
without our Knowledge, to the danger
of the whole; and these <HI>Intervals</HI> had
not been freed from the noxious parts,
which are here thrown out of the Body
by these <HI>Glands;</HI> but by their infinite
Number, ev'ry point and <HI>Atom</HI> of the <HI>A∣nimal</HI>
Body is taken care of. But that
<PB N="238" REF="389"/>
which is yet most wonderful, is the apt
proportioning this Sense of <HI>Feeling,</HI> to the
Actions and Impulses of the Bodies among
which we live. For had our Sense of <HI>Feeling</HI>
been ten or twenty times as exquisite as
it is, then we shou'd have been in perpe∣tual
Torment, ev'ry Hair had been a Dag∣ger,
the touch of a Feather, or of the
Wing of a <HI>Fly,</HI> had made us cry out,
we shou'd not have dar'd to have ap∣proach'd
our Cloaths or our Beds; in
short, we had liv'd in perpetual Misery;
and had it been as many times duller, or
more <HI>callous</HI> than it is, we had lost some
of the most exquisite Pleasures of Life,
our tenderest parts had been as insensible
as our Hairs or Nails, and might have
been torn away or consum'd, without our
Knowledge or Concern. Whereas by
this nice adjustment of the Sense of <HI>Feel∣ing</HI>
to the Impulses and Actions of Bodies
round us, we can live in indolence from
the Disturbance of the <HI>effluvia,</HI> and Acti∣ons
of little Bodies that are necessarily in
Motion; and we feel sensibly enough, to
<PB N="239" REF="390"/>
hinder us from hazarding the Ruin of our
Fabrick. And universally indeed in all <HI>A∣nimals</HI>
whatsoever, this Sense is adapted
to the Circumstances wherein they live,
which is a notable Instance of <HI>Council</HI> and
<HI>Design</HI> in the formation of these Parts.
And it is worth noticeing, that this Sense
of <HI>Feeling</HI> is rendred more exquisite and
sensible, or more dull and imperceptible,
as it is more or less used; for it is highly
probable, that the <HI>Scales</HI> which compose
the <HI>Scarfskin,</HI> and guard the <HI>Organs</HI> of
this Sense from being violated, do arise
from the <HI>pressure</HI> of touching Bodies upon
the Mouths of the <HI>Superficial</HI> Vessels at
different times, by which some drops of
a viscid Fluid is forc'd out, which there
drying and hardning, becomes a small
<HI>Scale;</HI> and therefore the oftner the Mouths
of these Vessels are press'd upon, or the
oftner we use these <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>touching,</HI>
the more of these <HI>Scales</HI> are form'd, and
the Skin becomes the thicker, and so a
<HI>callousness</HI> grows upon it. And conse∣quently,
the more moderately we use

the Pleasures of Sense (the most exquisite
of which lie in that of <HI>Feeling</HI>) the more
lively and sensible they are, and the
more immoderately we use these Pleasures,
the less they are so; which is a wonder∣full
wise Contrivance of the <HI>Author</HI> of
<HI>Nature;</HI> for were it otherwise, so distra∣cted
is the most part of Mankind, that
they wou'd certainly destroy themselves,

<P>§ XLII. Having already shewn the
wonderful yet simple structure of the
<HI>Muscles,</HI> I have little more to add upon
that Head. For tho' ev'ry single <HI>Muscle,</HI>
of which there are about 446 in a Hu∣mane
Body, either in its <HI>Figure, Situati∣on</HI>
or <HI>Insertion,</HI> has something that speaks
<HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Council;</HI> yet seeing <HI>Borelli</HI> has
written a whole Book to shew this, and
to instance in all the Particulars, were to
transcribe it, or to write a whole <HI>Systeme</HI>
of <HI>Myologie,</HI> I shall refer my Reader for
his full Satisfaction in this Affair, to that
<PB N="241" REF="392"/>
learned and surprising Book <HI>De motu Ani∣malium,</HI>
and shall only suggest a few In∣stances.
1. Then the manner of the Dis∣position
of the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Fingers</HI> and
<HI>Toes,</HI> is admirable. We know that for the
uses of Life, these <HI>Muscles</HI> were to be strong
and large, that they might be sufficient for
the various, and forceable Motions of these
<HI>Organs;</HI> now had they been situated near
or about these Parts, they wou'd have al∣together
disturb'd their Motions, and
made these Places soft and spungy, and
consequently unfit for grasping and going:
And to avoid this, the <HI>Infinitely wise Au∣thor
of Nature,</HI> has plac'd them at a consi∣derable
distance from these <HI>Organs;</HI> and
that ev'n there, they might not in bending
the <HI>Arm</HI> or <HI>Leg,</HI> rise up and fill those
Places with their <HI>Bodies</HI> or <HI>Tendons,</HI>
he has ty'd them to the Bones by <HI>Annu∣lar
Ligaments;</HI> and also that one <HI>Tendon</HI>
might not be interrupted in its Course by
another, he has slit some, that others
might pass through them undisturb'd,
this is such a wonderful Instance of Wis∣dom
<PB N="242" REF="393"/>
and Design, that none can pass it
over without Admiration. 2. It is very
observable that in <HI>Muscular</HI> Motion the
Expense of <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> is not in Pro∣portion
to the Labour the <HI>Animal</HI> is at.
Mr. <HI>Bernoului</HI> in that <HI>Curious Meditation</HI>
about <HI>Muscular</HI> Motion, printed in the
<HI>Acta Lipsiae</HI> 1694, has demonstrated,
that the Expenses of <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> are
in a much less Proportion, than the ele∣vated
Weights; for supposing the <HI>Animal
Spirits</HI> expended, in bursting the Blood
<HI>Globules,</HI> in the <HI>vesicular</HI> Cells of the
<HI>Muscular Fibres,</HI> to be as 8, then a
Weight four times as great, as when they
are but as 5, may be lifted. So that
when the <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> are but as 5 to 8,
the Weight sustain'd by 'em shall be as 1
to 4. And the like of the other Propor∣tions
of the <HI>Animal Spirits;</HI> especially the
Difference becomes most sensible between
these <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> and the sustain'd
weights, when these <HI>Spirits</HI> are expended
in greatest Quantities. Now what a won∣derful
wise Contrivance and <HI>compendium</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="394"/>
of Nature is this? Here in great Labour,
the <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> which are the Substance,
or rather, the very Essence of the Blood,
are sav'd as much as is possible; so that
a Man who is obliged to hard Labour, is
not reduc'd to the necessity of having
twice or four times as much Victuals, as
one that is under no necessity to work.
we all know that the Spirits are the most
precious things in all the <HI>Animal Body,</HI> by
which we move, and our Blood <HI>circulates,
i. e.</HI> we live; by which all the Pleasures
of Life are relished, and all <HI>Sensation</HI> per∣form'd,
by which we have that Liveliness
and Agility, that Chearfulness and Tran∣quillity,
that actuates all our Enjoyments;
and without which, we are languid, and
dull, unactive, and thoughtless. Now
this, so necessary and useful a Substance,
was to be sav'd by all means possible, and
agreeable to the Necessities of Life, and
we see the wise Author of Nature, has
taken wonderful Care, that no Expenses
shou'd be made therein that cou'd be avoi∣ded.
3. What a strange variety of Mo∣tions
<PB N="244" REF="395"/>
are our <HI>Organs</HI> capable of? There
is no possible one, that might be useful
to us that we want, and how wonder∣fully
is the whole <HI>Machin</HI> adjusted? For
our erect Motion, the Center of Gravity
is so difpos'd, as to fall, by a Line drawn
from it to the Center of the <HI>Earth,</HI> al∣ways
in some part of the <HI>parallelogram</HI>
form'd by the outer sides of our Feet, and
two Lines drawn by our Toes and Heels,
by which means we are kept from tum∣bling,
and if at any time we chance to
throw this Line without that Space, and
so be in hazard of falling, our Arms, and
the various Motions of our Head, and
Breast, immediately bring it back within
that Space. Those <HI>Animals</HI> that are design'd
for flying or swiming on the Surface of
the Water, have all their strongest <HI>Mus∣cles</HI>
upon their Breasts, whereby they are
kept in the fittest Posture for swiming or
flying, the <HI>Center of Gravity</HI> being so dis∣posed
as naturally to keep their Heads e∣rect.
And in those <HI>Animals</HI> that live with∣in
the Surface of the Waters, there is a
<PB N="245" REF="396"/>
Bladder fill'd with Air, whose <HI>Orifice</HI> is
endow'd with a <HI>Muscular Sphincter,</HI> by
which they let out and take in the <HI>Air,</HI> to
render them <HI>Specifically</HI> lighter or heavier,
than the Fluid they swim in, and so sink
or emerge as their Occasions prompt them,
or as they pass to a <HI>Specifically</HI> lighter or
heavier <HI>Element;</HI> for by taking in more
<HI>Air,</HI> they become lighter than they were,
and so necessarily emerge, and by let∣ting
out some, they become heavier, and
so sink. But this Bladder is commonly
full of <HI>Air,</HI> which is under some Degree
of Condensation, from the <HI>pressure</HI> of the
<HI>Muscular</HI> sides thereof; such to wit, as
renders 'em in an <HI>Aequilibrium</HI> without any
Pain, with that kind of Fluid they live
most in, and they commonly alter their
<HI>Aequilibrium,</HI> by the Compression or Ex∣pansion
of this Bladder, which being cut
out, the Fish ever after, either swims on
the Surface or sinks to the Bottom. Birds
and Fowls that sleep, resting on one Foot
to ease the other, naturally lay their Heads
under their Wings, that so the <HI>Center</HI> of
<PB N="246" REF="397"/>
the <HI>Gravity</HI> of their whole Body, may fall
upon the Foot they stand on, and the <HI>Animal</HI>
be preserv'd from overturning; and those
Fowls that sleep so on the small Branches
of Trees, incline a little backwards, that
their Claws by the <HI>Gravity</HI> of their Body,
without any <HI>Muscular</HI> Contraction, may
grasp the Branch more strongly. These
are wonderful Instances of <HI>Divine Wisdom</HI>
and <HI>Providence;</HI> but those who please to
consult that noble Work of <HI>Borelli</HI>'s, will
find to their Satisfaction, a thousand such
Instances, relating to this Head alone of
<HI>Muscular</HI> Motion.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The Bones consist of hard
compacted <HI>Fibres,</HI> ty'd together by <HI>Trans∣verse</HI>
ones, after the manner of the <HI>Mus∣cles;</HI>
they are nourished by Blood Vessels
which enter their Substance at several Pla∣ces,
which upon the compleat growth of
these <HI>Bones,</HI> are so straitned as to admit
only what is sufficient to repair their De∣cays.
All the considerably thick <HI>Bones</HI>
are either hollow or spongious, and both
sorts contain an <HI>oleaginous</HI> Substance, pre∣serv'd
<PB N="247" REF="398"/>
in little <HI>Vesicles,</HI> which by the Heat
of the Body, is exhal'd through the po∣rous
Substance of these <HI>Bones,</HI> to supple
and anoint their <HI>Fibres,</HI> that they dry not,
and thereby grow brittle. All the <HI>Bones</HI>
are cover'd with a very sensible <HI>membrane</HI>
call'd the <HI>Periosteum,</HI> each large <HI>Bone,</HI> is
considerably bigger at the Extremities than
at the middle, and that for very wise Ends
and Purposes: For 1. Thereby the <HI>Arti∣culations</HI>
are made stronger, for had they
been lesser or equal to the middle, our
Limbs had been in hazard of being dis∣jointed
upon ev'ry Occasion. And 2. By
the largeness of these <HI>Tubercles,</HI> it comes
to pass, that in all the <HI>Revolution</HI> of the
joint. The <HI>Tendon</HI> is kept at the same di∣stance
of the <HI>Semidiameter</HI> of the <HI>Tubercle</HI>
from the Center thereof, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Cen∣ter
of Motion; whereby, in the <HI>Articulati∣ons</HI>
of the Shoulder and Knee especially,
the Arm and Leg, is capable of moving
round, more than a <HI>Semicircle</HI> which by,
no other Contrivance possible, but this
cou'd be obtain'd. There are several and
<PB N="248" REF="399"/>
various manners of <HI>Articulations</HI> of the
<HI>Bones</HI> into one another, wonderfully fit∣ted
for the Motions of the several Mem∣bers,
one is like <HI>Ball</HI> and <HI>Socket,</HI> by which
the <HI>Bone</HI> can move equally any way; as
the <HI>Thigh-Bone</HI> with the <HI>Ischium;</HI> others
are by way of <HI>Charnal,</HI> as the <HI>Radius</HI>
with the <HI>Ʋlna;</HI> a third are only ty'd to∣gether
by intervening <HI>Cartilages,</HI> as the
<HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back. Now all these dif∣ferent
<HI>Articulations</HI> are from the Necessi∣ty
of the <HI>Situation,</HI> or Motion of these
<HI>Bones.</HI> The <HI>Bones</HI> in order to be the
most convenient that might be, ought to
have been as light, as was reconcileable
with a sufficient degree of Strength, that
the Instruments of Motion, might not re∣quire
too great an Expense of Spirits, to
move them, and that the <HI>mechanical Ma∣chin</HI>
might not become a Burthen to
themselves; now the wise <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Na∣ture,</HI>
has wonderfully provided for this,
for he has made 'em light, by evacuating
their middle Substance, and yet they are
stronger by very far, than if they had
<PB N="249" REF="400"/>
compos'd one solid <HI>Cylinder;</HI> for <HI>Galile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
has demonstrated, that of two <HI>Bones</HI> of
equal lengths, and of equal Number of
<HI>Fibres;</HI> the Strength of the one is to the
Strength of the other, as their <HI>Diameters</HI>
are; so that a hollow <HI>Bone</HI> of a double
<HI>Diameter,</HI> to a close one of the same Num∣ber
of <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as 2 to 1, or the first is
twice as strong as the second. This is most
conspicuous in those <HI>Animals</HI> that are
form'd to fly; it is wonderful, how light
and yet how strong, the Quils of their
Feathers and their <HI>Bones</HI> are, and this
wonderful wise <HI>End,</HI> cou'd no otherways
be obtain'd but by this Contrivance. <HI>Bo∣relli</HI>
hath shewn that these <HI>Bones</HI> are so
many <HI>Vectes,</HI> of which the Center of the
<HI>Articulation</HI> is the <HI>Fulcrum,</HI> the <HI>Tendons</HI>
are the <HI>Ropes,</HI> by which the <HI>Vires Moti∣vae</HI>
of the <HI>Muscles</HI> elevate, and move a∣ny
weight, or overcome any Resistence.
There is a wonderful, and exactly nice
<HI>Geometry</HI> used by Nature in the Figure,
Connexion, Order, and Motions of these
<HI>Pillars</HI> of the Body, and of their Cover
<PB N="250" REF="401"/>
the <HI>Muscles;</HI> it were alone a sufficient
work, to shew all the <HI>Necessities,</HI> the
wise <HI>Contrivances,</HI> and prudent <HI>adaptati∣ons</HI>
of these admirable <HI>Machines</HI> for the
benefit of the whole. I shall instance
only in two or three Particulars, and then
proceed. 1. Then, what can be more won∣derfully
contriv'd than the <HI>Backbone,</HI> had
it been all of one entire <HI>Bone,</HI> without <HI>Ar∣ticulations,</HI>
we cou'd not have stoop'd or
turn'd, but have gone forward like a Post
or a Pillar; had it been compos'd of a few
<HI>Bones</HI> only, then the <HI>Articulations</HI> of these
<HI>Bones</HI> in bending our Backs, must have
made a large <HI>Angle</HI> upon their innermost
edges, and so the <HI>Spinal Marrow,</HI> which
sends <HI>Nerves</HI> to all the Inferiour part of
the Body, had been in hazard of being
bruis'd at every stooping; and conse∣quently
all the inferiour Parts, had been
in perpetual hazard of being depriv'd of
the Instruments of their Motions; besides
that the whole wou'd not have been pli∣able,
for the various Postures we have
occasion to put our selves in. If it had
<PB N="251" REF="402"/>
consisted of various <HI>Bones</HI> without inter∣vening
<HI>Catilages,</HI> we shou'd have had no
more Benefit by it, than if it had been
entire without <HI>Articulations,</HI> or had these
<HI>Articulations</HI> been after the manner of
some others of the <HI>Bones,</HI> we had not
been capable of these Varieties of Moti∣ons
that we now are, if each <HI>Vertebra</HI>
had had its own proper <HI>Cartilage,</HI> the <HI>Ar∣ticulations</HI>
might have been easily disjoin∣ted.
So that we see, the Contrivance of
this Hulk as it were, of the Body is the
best that can be imagin'd; for by these
many and small <HI>Articulations</HI> upon some∣what
plain and smooth Surfaces, ty'd by
a common <HI>Cartilage,</HI> the Back for the Se∣curity
of that <HI>Medullary</HI> Substance, that
runs down its <HI>Cavity,</HI> is bent after the
manner of the <HI>Catenarian Curve,</HI> by which
it obtains that <HI>Curvature</HI> that is safest for
the included <HI>Marrow,</HI> and brings the
greatest degree of firmness; the oblique
Processes of each Superiour and Inferiour
<HI>Vertebra,</HI> keeping the middle, from being
thrust backwards of forwards, to hurt the
<PB N="252" REF="403"/>
<HI>Spinal Marrow.</HI> Besides, had not the
<HI>Transverse Processes</HI> been so plac'd as they
are, to keep the intermediate <HI>Vertebra</HI>
from being thrust backward or forward,
then there wou'd have been no more rea∣son
why in <HI>Inspiration,</HI> the <HI>Ribs</HI> shou'd
have mov'd upwards and forwards, than
backwards. But as they are now contriv'd,
these <HI>Processes</HI> force the <HI>Ribs</HI> to move up∣wards,
and so lift up the <HI>Sternum,</HI> whence
the <HI>dilatation</HI> of the <HI>Thorax</HI> proceeds, which
cou'd not <HI>dilate,</HI> were there no <HI>Transverse
Processes,</HI> or they otherwise dispos'd.
Now can there be a more manifest In∣stance
of Council and Contrivance than
this. Certainly, if infinite Wisdom were
suppos'd to have fram'd this part, it cou'd
not have giv'n a more pregnant Indicati∣on
thereof. 2. As I have observ'd be∣fore,
some <HI>Bones</HI> are articulated after the
manner of <HI>Ball</HI> and <HI>Socket</HI> as the <HI>Humerus</HI>
with the <HI>Scapula,</HI> and that for this wise
End, that the Arm might have all man∣ner
of possible Motions; but the <HI>Ʋlna</HI>
and <HI>Cubitus</HI> is join'd by way of <HI>Charnal,</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="404"/>
that this <HI>Articulation</HI> might be the more
strong, for had it been after the former
manner, we shou'd have had no Benefit
thereby, for that <HI>Articulation</HI> of the Shoul∣der,
takes off the Necessity of another
such here; the Hand by it, having all the
Motions, that it could have by another of
the same kind in this other <HI>Articulation;</HI>
and we shou'd have lost the Benefit of
the greater Strength in this Joint. Thus
we see, Nature in these Motions loses no
Benefit in the several Parts, that can con∣sist
with the good of the whole. 3. Be∣cause
the <HI>Tubercles</HI> of the <HI>Bones</HI> of the
<HI>Fingers</HI> and <HI>Toes,</HI> cou'd not be conveni∣ently
so large in Proportion to the middle
of these <HI>Bones</HI> as they are in others, be∣cause
thereby in grasping or squeezing,
these points of the <HI>Fingers</HI> which are at
the <HI>Articulations,</HI> cou'd only come into
<HI>contact</HI> with the Body squeez'd, and so
the Action cou'd not be uniform; and
by this smalness of these <HI>Tubercles,</HI> there
was a hazard of bringing the direction of
the Action of the <HI>Tendons</HI> of those <HI>Mus∣cles,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="405"/>
which contract the <HI>Finger</HI> and <HI>Toes,</HI>
quite through, or very near the <HI>Center</HI> of
<HI>Motion;</HI> whereby this Action wou'd have
been quite, or almost destroy'd. Now
to prevent this Inconvenience, the <HI>Ossa
Sesamoidoea</HI> (call'd so from their Resem∣blance
to the Grains of <HI>Sesamum</HI>) are
plac'd at the <HI>Articulations</HI> of these <HI>Bones,</HI>
to serve as so many <HI>Pullies,</HI> about which
the <HI>Tendons</HI> pass, at some distance from
the Center of the <HI>Articulation,</HI> whereby
the direction of the Motion of these <HI>Ten∣dons,</HI>
are remov'd always at the same
distance from the Center of Motion, of
the <HI>Articulation.</HI> The same Artifice is us'd
in the <HI>Knee,</HI> by means of the <HI>Patella;</HI>
these are wise and noble Ends, which
the Wit of Men cou'd not have thought
of, had they not observ'd them.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. How wonderfully is the Brain
contriv'd, how carefully and strongly is
that principal <HI>Organ</HI> of the Body, fenc'd
from external Injuries, by a thick Wall
of hard <HI>Bone,</HI> and two very close and
compact <HI>Membranes?</HI> What an infinite
<PB N="255" REF="406"/>
Multitude of <HI>Glands,</HI> are in the <HI>Cortical</HI>
part, and of begining <HI>Nerves</HI> in the <HI>Me∣dullar</HI>
Part, a hundred of which do not
exceed one single Hair? How commodi∣ously
are the <HI>Nerves,</HI> that serve for four
of the <HI>Senses,</HI> and all the parts of the <HI>Su∣periour
Regions,</HI> sent out the shortest and
safest ways through proper Holes in the
Head? And those that serve the <HI>Inferi∣our
Regions</HI> of the Body, carry'd down
in a <HI>Bony Channel.</HI> And it is very remark∣able,
that the <HI>Veins</HI> do not pass out, at
the same Holes the <HI>Arteries</HI> enter; for if
they did, then upon any violent Motion
of the Blood, or any greater Quantity
thereof than ordinary, log'd in the <HI>Arte∣ries,</HI>
their <HI>dilatation</HI> and <HI>pulsation</HI> wou'd
compress the <HI>Veins</HI> against the <HI>bony</HI> sides
of their Passage, and so occasion a <HI>stagna∣tion</HI>
and <HI>extravasation</HI> of the Blood in the
Brain, to the destruction of the whole
<HI>Machin;</HI> which by these different <HI>Entries</HI>
and <HI>Exits</HI> of these Vessels is prevented.
These <HI>Veins</HI> also do not run along by the
sides of the <HI>Arteries</HI> in the Brain, as they
<PB N="256" REF="407"/>
do through all the rest of the Body, which
is also another wise Contrivance of Nature;
for the <HI>Arteries</HI> here, were by their <HI>dilata∣tion</HI>
to press out the Juice from the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
into the <HI>Muscles</HI> of <HI>involuntary</HI> Motion,
which wou'd have been hindred if the
<HI>Veins</HI> had always gone along with the <HI>Ar∣teries;</HI>
for these <HI>Veins</HI> wou'd have receiv'd
the impulse of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> and thereby
in some Measure kept it from the <HI>Nerves.</HI>
Next how strongly is the <HI>Heart</HI> built, and
with what a Force does it squeeze out
the Blood into the <HI>Arteries; Borelli</HI> reckons
it equal to the force of 3000 Pound weight,
and that 350 Pound weight of Blood, pas∣ses
through the <HI>Heart</HI> ev'ry Hour. How
variously and effectual for its end, are its
<HI>muscular Fibres</HI> arrang'd, and with what
Judgment are its <HI>Columns</HI> and <HI>Furrows</HI>
dispos'd! for the closer Contraction of its
<HI>Ventricles,</HI> its point is turn'd a little to∣ward
the left side, for the more easie as∣cent
of the refluent Blood in the <HI>Cava,</HI>
for thereby like a reclining inverted <HI>Si∣phon,</HI>
the left <HI>Auricle</HI> becomes lower than
<PB N="257" REF="408"/>
the right. All the <HI>Auricles</HI> and <HI>Ventricles</HI>
have <HI>Valvs,</HI> whereby the Blood has a
passage in its true course forward, but
is hindred from returning the same way;
which wou'd frequently happen, upon
the equal <HI>pressure</HI> of the Blood on all Hands,
and the Resistance of the sides of the Ves∣sels,
to the Ruin of the <HI>Animal;</HI> which
Inconvenience is entirely prevented, by
this prudent Contrivance and Situation of
the <HI>Valvs.</HI> And ev'n the Figure of the
<HI>Valvs</HI> themselves, in the several different
Places, is for wise Ends and Purposes.
But that which is most wonderful in this
Affair, is the different <HI>Structure</HI> of the
<HI>Heart</HI> in the <HI>Foetus,</HI> from that of the
same in adult Persons. In the Heart of
the <HI>Foetus,</HI> just opposite to the Mouth
of the <HI>Cava ascendens,</HI> there is a Hole
from the <HI>Cava,</HI> that opens into the <HI>Vena
Pulmonalis,</HI> and is call'd the <HI>Foramen Ovale;</HI>
there is likewise a Passage, which runs
from the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> to the <HI>Trunk</HI>
of <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis.</HI> Now the Blood
which is receiv'd by the <HI>Placenta</HI> from
<PB N="258" REF="409"/>
the Mother, is by the <HI>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bilical Veins</HI> car∣ried
into the <HI>Porta,</HI> from which it is sent
to the <HI>Cava,</HI> by a Canal which goes straight
from the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the one, to the <HI>Trunk</HI> of
the other, by the <HI>Cava</HI> it is thrown through
the <HI>foramen Ovale,</HI> into the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis,</HI>
which carries it to the left <HI>Ventricle</HI> of the
<HI>Heart,</HI> by which it is squeez'd into the <HI>Aor∣ta,</HI>
to be dispers'd over the Body. The
Blood that comes from the <HI>Superiour Parts</HI>
of the Body, is diverted by the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of
the <HI>Cava</HI> from the <HI>foramen Ovale,</HI> and falls
into the right <HI>Ventricle,</HI> which throws it
into the <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis,</HI> from whence
by the communicating Canal, it is imme∣diately
carried into the <HI>Aorta;</HI> so that the
Blood that comes from the <HI>Cava ascendens,</HI>
passes only through the right <HI>Ventricle,</HI>
whilst that which comes from the <HI>Descen∣dens,</HI>
passes only through the left <HI>Ventri∣cle.</HI>
The reason of which Passages, is be∣cause
the Blood in the <HI>Foetus</HI> cou'd not
go through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> their <HI>Vesicles</HI> by
their compressure upon the Blood Vessels,
obstructing that Course; neither indeed,
<PB N="259" REF="410"/>
did the Blood need to pass through the
<HI>Lungs,</HI> the <HI>Foetus</HI> being nourished from
the Mother, whose Fluids had already re∣ceiv'd,
all the Advantages they cou'd reap
from the Air, in her <HI>Lungs;</HI> but when
it comes into the <HI>Air,</HI> and is no longer
nourished from the Blood of the Mo∣ther,
this <HI>pressure</HI> is taken off from
the Blood Vessels, by the distension
of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> after the manner already
explain'd. And so finding a free Passage
through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> it runs no more by
the communicating Canal: And so that
dries up; and by the current in the <HI>Pul∣monary
Vein,</HI> the <HI>Valve</HI> of the <HI>foramen O∣vale</HI>
is shut so, that the Blood can no
more pass that way from the <HI>Cava.</HI> Now
how wisely are these different Channels
for the Blood contriv'd, for the different
necessities of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> before and after
its Birth! This is a plain Indication of
<HI>fore-knowledge,</HI> and of such an one as no∣thing
but Omniscence, is sufficient for.
And this is certainly one of the most con∣vincing
Proofs of <HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Counsel,</HI> that
<PB N="260" REF="411"/>
can possibly be wish'd for; for to provide
for an Event, that in the natural Course
of things, must happen a long time after,
is an infallible evidence, that the thing
was foreseen, and the Provision design'd,
by some intelligent Being. But this is not
the only Instance of a <HI>Precaution,</HI> for it's
evident, all the several Steps of the <HI>growth</HI>
and <HI>Vegetation,</HI> both of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Plants,</HI>
have been foreseen, and fore-design'd, by
the wise <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> seeing, diffe∣rent
Provisions are made, and different
Circumstances adjusted, for these various
Periods of their Lives.</P>
<P>§ XLV. What a noble piece of <HI>Geo∣metry</HI>
is manifested in the <HI>Fabrick</HI> of the
<HI>Eye,</HI> and the manner of <HI>Vision!</HI> Without
this <HI>Organ, Animals</HI> cou'd not provide
themselves with Food, nor be forewarn'd
of approaching Danger, and consequent∣ly,
cou'd not guard against it; without
the Benefit of <HI>Light,</HI> the animated part of
this <HI>System,</HI> wou'd be but so many <HI>Pup∣pets,</HI>
toss'd up and down by Chance and
Fortune, without House or Habitation,
<PB N="261" REF="412"/>
and depriv'd of all the Pleasures and Con∣veniences
of Life. What a miserable
State wou'd it be, to be confin'd to per∣petual
Darkness, and never to behold the
chearful Light? the Misery of such a Life
is beyond Expression and Conception:
And on the other Hand, what can be
more amazing, than that the Particles of
Matter shou'd be so fram'd, as by their
means to shew us the <HI>Shapes, Positions,
Distances, Motions,</HI> yea and <HI>Colours</HI> of re∣mote
Bodies? How wonderfully must the
several Coats and Humours of this little
<HI>Ball</HI> be dispos'd, to transmit through them
that fine, and subtile Fluid, which is emit∣ted
from <HI>luminous</HI> Bodies, and reflected
from the Surfaces of <HI>Opake</HI> ones; and u∣nited
on the bottom of the <HI>Eye.</HI> These
things are not only contriv'd and fram'd
with so great Wisdom and Skill, as not
to admit of a better; but to any one
who attentively considers them, they seem
of such a Nature as scarcely to allow any
other Method, for it seems impossible that
<HI>Light</HI> shou'd represent <HI>Objects</HI> to us, at
<PB N="262" REF="413"/>
so vast a distance, but by the transmissi∣on
of some fine Fluid, from the <HI>Object</HI>
upon the <HI>Eye.</HI> And it seems impossible
that any other Composition of the <HI>Eye,</HI>
shou'd be equally fitted for that end.
The <HI>Globe</HI> of the <HI>Eye</HI> is <HI>spherical;</HI> it is
compos'd of six <HI>Coats,</HI> and three <HI>Humours,</HI>
the first <HI>Coat</HI> is call'd the <HI>Conjunctiva,</HI> and
makes the white of the <HI>Eye.</HI> The second
<HI>Sclerotica,</HI> it is thick, hard, and smooth,
<HI>Opake</HI> behind, but <HI>Transparent</HI> before;
where it makes the third Coat call'd the
<HI>Cornea,</HI> from its Resemblance to a piece
of <HI>Transparent</HI> Horn, it has a greater con∣vexity,
than the rest of the <HI>Globe</HI> of the
Eye, consists of several <HI>Laminae,</HI> which are
nourish'd by so small Blood Vessels, as to
obstruct very little of the Light. It is of
an exquisite Sense, that upon any touch,
the Tears might be squeez'd from the <HI>La∣chrymal
Glands,</HI> to wash and clean it.
The fourth <HI>Coat</HI> is the <HI>Choroides,</HI> it lies
under the <HI>Sclerotica,</HI> it hath little <HI>Glands</HI>
which separate a black Liquor, which <HI>Tin∣ctures</HI>
the internal side thereof (which
<PB N="263" REF="414"/>
is otherwise of a whitish Colour) for hin∣dring
the reflected Light from disturbing
the Pictures of Objects; this Coat has a
Hole before, which is called the <HI>Pupilla,</HI>
for admitting the Light. The fifth is the
<HI>Ʋvea,</HI> which is nothing but the Circum∣ference
of the <HI>Pupilla;</HI> it is compos'd of
circular and straight <HI>Fibres,</HI> to contract or
dilate, according to the strength or weak∣ness
of the Light, for when the Light is
too strong, the <HI>Circular Fibres</HI> contract
the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> that their Force hurt not the
<HI>Eye;</HI> and when it is weak, the straight
<HI>Fibres</HI> dilate it, to let in more Rays, for
the more distinct Vision. On the inside
of the <HI>Ʋvea</HI> from its <HI>Circumference</HI> which
joins the <HI>Choroides,</HI> rises the <HI>Ligamentum
Ciliare,</HI> by which the forepart of the <HI>Eye</HI> is
press'd outward, and the <HI>Retina</HI> backwad,
or the <HI>Axe</HI> of the <HI>Eye</HI> lengthned, at the
approach, of too near Objects. The sixth
<HI>Coat</HI> is the <HI>Retina,</HI> which covers like a
Net the bottom of the <HI>Eye,</HI> it is only a
fine expansion, of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Op∣tick
Nerve;</HI> upon this Coat, the Pictures
<PB N="264" REF="415"/>
of Objects are fram'd. The first Humour
is call'd the <HI>Aqueous,</HI> it lies immediately
under the <HI>Cornea,</HI> it is thin and liquid,
and of a spirituous Nature, in so much
that it will not freeze in the greatest Frost.
The second is the <HI>Chrystalline,</HI> next the
<HI>Aqueous;</HI> it is convex on both sides, and
resembles a double convex <HI>Lens;</HI> it is co∣vered
with a fine <HI>Coat,</HI> call'd <HI>Aranea.</HI>
The third is the <HI>glassy</HI> Humour, it is
thicker than the <HI>Aqueous,</HI> and thinner
than the <HI>Chrystalline,</HI> it gives a <HI>Spherical</HI>
Figure to the <HI>Eye,</HI> upon its back part, is
the <HI>Retina</HI> spread, which it keepeth at a
distance from the <HI>Chrystalline</HI> Humour, re∣quisite
to receive the distinct impression of
Objects. The <HI>Optick Nerves</HI> are inserted
in the inside of the <HI>Optik Axes,</HI> whereby
the middle point of ev'ry Object is di∣stinctly
seen, for the Center of the <HI>Reti∣na</HI>
is insensible, as Monsieur <HI>Mariotte</HI> has
shewn by Experiment. And consequent∣ly,
had the Center of the <HI>Optick Nerves</HI>
coincided, with that of the <HI>Retina,</HI> the
midle point of any Object, had been in∣visible;
<PB N="265" REF="416"/>
but by this lateral Insertion of
these <HI>Nerves,</HI> the point of the Object
which is invisible in the one <HI>Eye,</HI> becomes
visible in the other; for it is impossible,
that the Rays shou'd fall on the inside of
both <HI>Eyes</HI> at the same time. The light
which comes from the several points of
Objects, is so refracted (by the <HI>Cornea</HI> and
<HI>Christalline Humour</HI> principally) as to meet
again upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> and there to paint
in the same Order and Proportion, with
the Object, the Image thereof, (as is evi∣dent
by taking off that part of the <HI>Dura
Mater,</HI> which covers the backside of the
<HI>Retina,</HI> from the <HI>Eye</HI> of any dead <HI>Animal,</HI>
and then placing the <HI>Eye</HI> in a fit Hole, of
a dark'ned Room; for looking then upon
the back part of the <HI>Retina,</HI> we shall see
through it, the Pictures of external Objects
painted upon its inside) and these Pictures
propagated by Motion, along the <HI>Optick
Nerves,</HI> are the Cause of <HI>Vision.</HI> Now
what can be more admirable than this
structure of the <HI>Eye;</HI> ev'ry part contribu∣ting
something toward its Perfection. The
<PB N="266" REF="417"/>
<HI>Cornea</HI> is more <HI>convex</HI> than any other part
of the <HI>Eye,</HI> by which all the Rays are ga∣thered,
to pass through the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> and
few of 'em lost on the <HI>Ʋvea.</HI> The <HI>A∣queous
Humour</HI> being thin, easily changes
its Figure, either when the <HI>Ligamentum
Ciliare</HI> contracts, or both the oblique
<HI>Muscles</HI> protrude, the Bulb of the <HI>Eye,</HI> to
render it oblong, when Objects are too
near; the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Ʋvea</HI> contract or
dilate the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> according to the De∣grees
of the Strength of the light. The
<HI>glassy Humour</HI> keeps the <HI>Retina</HI> at a due
distance from the <HI>Chrystallin,</HI> the Images
are painted upon a Skin, produc'd by the
Expansion of the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> for the
more easie conveyance of the Impression
to the Brain. The <HI>Choroides</HI> is tinctur'd
black, that the Rays that pass through it
may not be reflected back again upon the
<HI>Retina,</HI> and so confound the Object. The
<HI>Optick Nerves</HI> are inserted on the inside of
the <HI>Axes</HI> of the <HI>Eye,</HI> that the whole Ob∣ject
may be distinctly view'd; the Hairs
of the <HI>Eyebrows,</HI> break the direct Rays
<PB N="267" REF="418"/>
that they hurt not the sight; those on the
<HI>Eyelids</HI> defend it from filth and light Bo∣dies
that swim in the <HI>Air;</HI> the continual
Motion of <HI>Eyelids,</HI> moisten and sweep
the <HI>Cornea,</HI> else it wou'd dry or grow dir∣ty;
it is sunk in a Hole, wall'd with a
strong <HI>Bone,</HI> to keep it from more pow∣erful
Injuries. The several refractive Vir∣tues
of the <HI>Coats</HI> and <HI>Humours,</HI> serve to
correct the Errors arising from the diffe∣rent
<HI>Refrangibilities</HI> of the Rays of Light.
Our Eyes are double, to secure both sides
from Danger, because if the Objects
were near, however one <HI>Eye</HI> were plac'd;
we cou'd not distinctly perceive them that
shou'd be situated toward the sides of our
Body, and so cou'd not guard our selves
from the Dangers, thence arising. Besides
we cou'd not distinguish the distance of
Objects by one <HI>Eye,</HI> for our two <HI>Eyes</HI> are
like two different Stations in <HI>Longimetry,</HI>
by the assistance of which, the distance
between two Objects is measured. As al∣so,
when one <HI>Eye</HI> is accidentally rendred
useless, we enjoy the Blessings of this so
<PB N="268" REF="419"/>
necessary a Sense, by the Benefit of the
other. It is observable that the Figure
of the <HI>Chrystallin</HI> Humour of Fishes, is a
great deal nearer to a <HI>Sphere,</HI> than that
of Land <HI>Animals,</HI> and that because of the
different refractive Vertue of Water from
Air, for that convexity which wou'd unite
the Rays of Light coming through Air,
will not unite the same so perfectly at a
point, in the same distance, coming
through Water. In those <HI>Animals</HI> that ga∣ther
their Food from the Ground the <HI>Pupill</HI>
is <HI>Oval</HI> or <HI>Elliptical,</HI> the greatest <HI>Diame∣ter</HI>
going transversly from side to side; in
those that seek their Food on higher Pla∣ces,
its greatest <HI>Diameter</HI> goes from the
top of the Head towards the Feet <HI>perpen∣dicularly;</HI>
these two different Figures be∣ing
wonderfully fitted to the different ne∣cessities
of these <HI>Animals.</HI> Those living
Creatures that by their Figure, and for o∣ther
reasons, have no Motions of their
Neck, have a Cluster of <HI>Semispherical Eye∣balls</HI>
which send in the Pictures of Objects
all around them; and those that seek
<PB N="269" REF="420"/>
their Food in the dark, have their <HI>Retina</HI>
coloured white, which reflects the light
and enables them to see best in the least
light; these are wonderful and surprizing
Instances, of <HI>Foresight</HI> and <HI>Counsel</HI> in that
Being that fram'd these <HI>Organs;</HI> but that
which to me is most surprizing in this Af∣fair,
is that in rational Creatures, whose
<HI>Organs</HI> are sound; they shou'd have been
so nicely fram'd in all the infinite possible
Varieties over and under, as to repre∣sent
Objects at a due Distance of their
true and real <HI>Magnitudes,</HI> and this we are
certain of by our other Senses, which
all concur to demonstrate that Objects
at a due Distance, are of the same real
<HI>Magnitude</HI> our <HI>Eyes</HI> represent them. Now
we know from the Laws of <HI>Opticks,</HI>
that had the <HI>Retina</HI> been remov'd farther
from, or brought nearer the <HI>Christallin</HI>
Humor, or (keeping the <HI>Retina</HI> at the
same Distance from that Humor) had it
consisted of two <HI>Segments</HI> of a less or
greater <HI>Sphere,</HI> the Vision had been in∣distinct
or none at all; or had the Di∣stance
<PB N="270" REF="421"/>
been fitted exactly in the <HI>Focus</HI> of
the <HI>Christallin,</HI> but had it consisted of
of <HI>Segments</HI> of <HI>Spheres,</HI> less or greater,
than those of our <HI>Christallin Humour,</HI> that
are at present, we had seen Objects ev'n
at a due Distance, either bigger or less
than the Truth, which wou'd have ex∣pos'd
us to a thousand dangerous Mi∣stakes;
for Example, the Precipice that
perhaps was not many Feet from us,
might have appear'd at some Paces Di∣stance,
and we have tumbled down, ere
we were aware, or the <HI>Atom</HI> that we
now scarce take Notice of, wou'd have
covered all our View, and hindered us
from taking in any other Object; in a
word, besides that thus we shou'd not
have discovered the true <HI>Magnitude</HI> of
Objects, which wou'd have had a thou∣sand
fatal Consequences, had our Eyes
magnified Objects, any thing considera∣bly,
we cou'd have seen but a very small
part of them at once, and twenty dange∣rous
things might have been in our ways,
which we cou'd not have discovered, but
<PB N="271" REF="422"/>
by a great deal of Pains; so that our Pro∣gressive
Motions, must have been slower
than those of <HI>Reptils,</HI> and then ev'ry little
Particle, likewise, wou'd have been able
to have damn'd up, and obstructed our
Sight; and had our <HI>Eyes</HI> diminished Ob∣jects
considerably, we cou'd have seen
them but faintly and indistinctly, all mi∣nute
Bodies wou'd have vanished, and
we might have been destroy'd by those
which we thought at a distance. In one
Word, there are Infinities of different
Ways, our <HI>Eyes</HI> might have possibly
been form'd, none of which cou'd have
brought with it, the Advantages the pre∣sent
Structure does. Can there then be a
more pregnant and convincing Evidence
of the <HI>Being</HI> of an <HI>infinitely wise</HI> Power,
who out of the infinite possible Varieties,
of disadvantagious Fabricks of this <HI>Organ,</HI>
has singled out that only one, that was
best; he certainly deserves not to enjoy
the Blessings of his <HI>Eye Sight,</HI> whose Mind
is so deprav'd, as not to acknowledge
the Bounty and Wisdom of the Au∣thor
<PB N="272" REF="423"/>
of his Nature, in the <HI>ravishing</HI>
and <HI>astonishing</HI> Structure of this noble
<HI>Organ.</HI></P>
<P>§ XLVI. <HI>Hearing</HI> is the next Sense in
Dignity to <HI>Seeing,</HI> (for I reckon <HI>Feeling</HI>
a general one, of which the rest are only
particular <HI>Modifications</HI>) without which
our Lives wou'd be very Comfortless.
It is by Means of this Sense, we enjoy
the Benefits of Conversation, and the
Pleasures of <HI>Musick;</HI> and by it we are
forewarn'd of those Dangers, our Eyes
cannot inform us of; and what can be
more wonderful than that the same <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
of Air, shou'd serve us for so ma∣ny
different, yet necessary Uses: By it
our Vapours are supported, and buoy'd
up to the higher Regions, to be there
form'd into Snow or Rain, according to
the Exigences of different <HI>Climates;</HI> by
it's Motion our Winds are produc'd,
which sail our Ships, and purifie our
<HI>Atmosphere;</HI> by drawing it in we live, and
our Blood is fitted to perform its <HI>Circu∣lations;</HI>
by it Sounds are convey'd to our
<PB N="273" REF="424"/>
<HI>Ears,</HI> and other Mens Thoughts to our
Minds. The Internal Parts of the <HI>Ear</HI>
are these, 1. The <HI>Meatus Auditorius,</HI>
which is a contorted Passage for the out∣ward
Air, runing first upward, and then
downward; here are many <HI>Glands,</HI>
which separate a viscid glutinous Matter,
which hinders Insects, or any hurtful
thing, from corroding the <HI>Tympanum,</HI>
which is a second principal Part of the
internal <HI>Ear.</HI> It is a thin <HI>Membrane,</HI> like
the Head of a Drum, stretch'd upon a
Bony Circle, behind which is the <HI>Barrel,</HI>
in the Cavity of which there are four
little Bones call'd the <HI>Hammer,</HI> the <HI>An∣vil,</HI>
the <HI>Stirrup,</HI> and the <HI>Os orbiculare.</HI> In
this <HI>Barrel</HI> there are several Holes, one
of which opens, behinds the Palate of
the Mouth, and receives Air to supply
these Cavities, that have no Communi∣cation
with the Air, coming in by the
outward <HI>Ear.</HI> Next to the <HI>Barrel,</HI> is the
<HI>Labyrinth,</HI> which ends in the <HI>Vestibulum,</HI>
and is follow'd by the <HI>Cochlea,</HI> which is
a Passage resembling a <HI>Snail's Shell,</HI> in
<PB N="274" REF="425"/>
it the Auditory <HI>Nerves</HI> terminate. Now
when any Sound is propagated in <HI>Ʋndula∣tions</HI>
through the Air (the <HI>Sonorous</HI> Body
striking the Ambient, Air by many repea∣ted
<HI>Vibrations,</HI> excites these <HI>undulations</HI>
in it, after the manner any heavy Body
thrown into a standing Lake, raises in
the Water, Waves in a Circle round it)
these are gathered by the <HI>Concha,</HI> or ex∣ternal
<HI>Ear,</HI> and carried through the <HI>Mea∣tus
Auditorius,</HI> to the <HI>Tympanum</HI> or
Drum, on which beating, the four little
Bones that are in the <HI>Barrel,</HI> are thereby
mov'd; and as the Drum is struck by the
external Air, after the same manner is the
internal Air mov'd by these little Bones;
and this internal Air, thus mov'd, makes
an Impression upon the <HI>Auditory Nerves,</HI> in
the <HI>Labyrinth</HI> and <HI>Cochlea;</HI> so that as the ex∣ternal
Air strikes the <HI>Drum,</HI> so does it move
the Bones in the <HI>Barrel,</HI> to strike the in∣ternal
Air after the same manner; and as it
is mov'd, so accordingly is the Impression
made upon the <HI>Auditory Nerves,</HI> and all
this <HI>Apparatus</HI> seems intended, to hinder
<PB N="275" REF="426"/>
the Sound from coming with too great
Violence upon these <HI>Nerves,</HI> for we find
that too sudden, and violent a Noise, is
still able to disturb these slender <HI>Tubes,</HI>
and sometimes to disorder them so, as to
deprive us of this <HI>Sense.</HI> Now how wise∣ly
is this necessary and pleasant <HI>Sense</HI>
contriv'd, for the Conveniences of Life!
Had it been more exquisite, then every
little Noise had been capable of distur∣bing
us, the buzzing of a Flie, or the
Noise of our own Breath, wou'd have
pirc'd our <HI>Ears</HI> like a Peal of Thunder,
and the Motion of every little <HI>Atom</HI>
wou'd have rob'd us of Rest; and had
this <HI>Sense</HI> been any thing considerably more
dull, we shou'd have been in proportion
thereto, depriv'd of all the Pleasures and
Advantages thence arising: so that it's e∣vident
our <HI>Hearing,</HI> is nicely adjusted to
the Conveniencies and Necessities of Life,
which is a plain Instance of <HI>Design</HI> in the
Fabrick of this <HI>Organ;</HI> the same might
be demonstrated of the two remaining Sen∣ses,
which for Brevities sake I must now
omit.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="427"/>
§ XLVII. I have before observ'd, that
all the Canals except the <HI>Arteries</HI> have
<HI>Valves,</HI> by which their Fluids are per∣mitted
to go forward, in their Course,
but hindered from returning back, all
these <HI>Valves,</HI> opening toward the term
of the Natural Motion, of these Fluids,
but shuting by the Pressure of the Blood in
a contrary Direction, and thereby ob∣structing
that backward Motion. These
<HI>Valves</HI> are visible, not only in the <HI>Veins</HI>
but in the <HI>Lymphaticks,</HI> the <HI>Lacteals</HI> and
<HI>Ductus Thoracicus;</HI> and it is observable
that this last <HI>Channel</HI> always goes up the
left side, that by the Pulsation of the
great <HI>Artery,</HI> upon which it immediately
lyes, the <HI>Chyle</HI> may be propell'd upward.
It is likewise remarkable, that all the
Branches of the <HI>Arteries</HI> which go off, at
any small Distance from the <HI>Trunks,</HI> do
all unite again in one <HI>Trunk,</HI> whose
Branches communicate with one another,
and with others, as before; and that for
this wife End, that when any small
<HI>Artery</HI> is obstructed, or cut, the Blood
<PB N="277" REF="428"/>
may be brought by the communicating
Branches, to the Parts below the Ob∣struction,
which must have otherwise
been depriv'd of Nourishment. The <HI>Velo∣city</HI>
of the <HI>Blood</HI> in the extreme <HI>Arteries</HI>
is considerably less, than that of the
same at the <HI>Heart,</HI> or its Entry into the
<HI>Aorta,</HI> because it is of these extreme <HI>Ar∣teries</HI>
the <HI>Glands</HI> are form'd, and by
them the secretions are made, which as was
before demonstrated, require different
<HI>Velocities</HI> in the Blood, to secern the
different <HI>Fluids</HI> in these <HI>Glands:</HI> this Di∣minution
of the <HI>Velocity</HI> is evident from
the Proportions Dr. <HI>Keill,</HI> (to whose Ac∣curate
<HI>Compendium,</HI> of the <HI>Anatomy</HI> of
<HI>Human Bodies,</HI> I have always had recourse,
where my Memory fail'd me) has giv'n us
all the Branches of the <HI>Arteries</HI> to the great
Trunk, whereby it appears the <HI>Diameter</HI>
of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> does not bear a greater Pro∣portion,
to the primary Branches of the <HI>Ar∣teries,</HI>
than 5 to 7: and doubtless the odds is
greater in the smaller Branches. How fru∣gal
has Nature been in the Structure of the
<PB N="278" REF="429"/>
<HI>Veins!</HI> for because of the less Pressure of
the <HI>Blood,</HI> against the sides of these wi∣dening
Channels, the thickness of their
Walls is in proportion less, than those of
the <HI>Arteries.</HI> Besides, that only those
<HI>Veins</HI> that run <HI>perpendicular</HI> to the <HI>Ho∣rizon,</HI>
are endow'd with <HI>Valves,</HI> which
stick to their Sides like so many Thimbles;
which when the Blood presses back, are
fill'd, and so stop its Passage, but are com∣pres'd
by the foreward Motion of the
Blood. Now these <HI>Valves</HI> were useless in
other <HI>Veins,</HI> for their widening Channels,
give no Occasion to the Blood to push back∣ward,
it's Gravity acting laterally and not
backward, as in those <HI>perpendicular</HI> to the
<HI>Horizon;</HI> the small Branches of these
<HI>Veins,</HI> communicate with one another,
for the same ends and purposes that the
<HI>Arteries</HI> did; and having now Occasion
to speak of the containing Vessels, I can∣not
omit here the wonderful Contrivance
of Nature in the Position of the several
Parts of the <HI>Faetus</HI> in the <HI>Ʋterus;</HI> the
<HI>Skull</HI> whereof in the first part of the time
of its <HI>Gestation</HI> being very thin, large and
<PB N="279" REF="430"/>
only <HI>Membranous,</HI> the <HI>Thorax</HI> and <HI>Abdo∣men</HI>
with the Limbs are so dispos'd as to
make the Head always emerge out of the
Fluid it lies in, or at least preserves it in a
Direction that it is still upward, with its
Face to toward it's Mothers Belly, but
about the time of its Delivery the Skull
thickens, and hardens, the Limbs and
Members stretch out, and so the Head
becomes the heaviest place in the Body
whereby it tumbles over, and acquires
that Posture which is fittest for its Deli∣very.
These are signal Instances of
Counsel and Foresight, in the Formation
of these <HI>Organs</HI> and parts, but I hasten to
a Close.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. Having I think sufficiently
made out that great Truth, to wit that
we are <HI>wonderfully made,</HI> though I have
pointed only at a few of those In∣stances
that the <HI>Animal</HI> Fabrick and <HI>Oe∣conomy</HI>
affords, I now come to make a
few general Observations under one Head,
and so to put a Close to this <HI>Chapter,</HI>
which has already swell'd to a far greater
<PB N="280" REF="431"/>
Bulk than I at first design'd it. It is very
remarkable, that those <HI>Animals, Plants,</HI>
and <HI>Minerals,</HI> that are of most Use, and
Advantage to us, are such as will grow
almost in every <HI>Soil</HI> and <HI>Climate,</HI> and are
more productive of their kind than others,
and are found in most Places. Thus <HI>Iron</HI> is
is found almost every where, <HI>Corn</HI> is the
Product of all Soils, and <HI>Climates,</HI> while
other more curious and nice <HI>Plants</HI> will
only thrive in their proper Soils: Thus
<HI>Hens, Geese,</HI> and <HI>Turkies</HI> are more pro∣ductive
than <HI>Crows</HI> or <HI>Jackdaws,</HI> and
<HI>Conies,</HI> and <HI>Hares,</HI> than <HI>Foxes</HI> or <HI>Lyons;</HI>
thus a <HI>Crane,</HI> which is but scurvy Meat,
lays but two Eggs, and the <HI>Alka</HI> and some
other Sea Fowls, but one, whereas the <HI>Pa∣tridge</HI>
and the <HI>Pheasant</HI> hath fifteen or twen∣ty,
and those which lay fewer, and are of
most value for Food, lay oftner, as the
<HI>Woodcok</HI> and the <HI>Dove.</HI> What is more
admirable, than the fitness of ev'ry Crea∣ture
for the use we make of him? The
<HI>docility</HI> of the <HI>Elephant,</HI> so long employ∣ed
in War, the <HI>Insitiency</HI> of the <HI>Camel,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="432"/>
for travelling in the patch'd and dry De∣serts,
the gentleness of the Sheep, the
Cleanness, Beauty, Strength, and Swift∣ness
of the Horse, whose Breath, Foam,
and ev'n Excrements are sweet, and there∣by
so well fitted for our Use and Service▪
How frugally has Nature avoided any
useless Expence of <HI>Organs,</HI> when the Cir∣cumstances
of the <HI>Animal</HI> wou'd have ren∣dred
'em so? Thus those <HI>Animals</HI> that
are slow of their Nature, have no very
quick sight, it being useless to such, since
their slowness allows them time to dwell
longer on an Object, as <HI>Snails</HI> and <HI>Moles;</HI>
but these that are endow'd with a quicker
Motion, have brisker Eyes, and a more
quick piercing sight, as <HI>Hawks</HI> and
<HI>Hares.</HI> Those <HI>Animals</HI> also, that have
no Ears have no <HI>Organs</HI> for making a
noise with; because wanting Ears, these
other wou'd be useless, as <HI>Fishes</HI> and other
Inhabitants of the watery <HI>Element.</HI> So
also, those <HI>Animals</HI> which have Teeth on
both Jaws, have but one Stomach, be∣cause
these Teeth render more Stomachs
<PB N="282" REF="433"/>
useless; and those <HI>Animals</HI> that have no
upper Teeth or none at all, have three
Stomachs to supply the want of these
Teeth; as in Beasts, the <HI>Panch,</HI> the <HI>Read</HI>
and the <HI>Feck;</HI> and in all granivorous Birds,
the <HI>Crop,</HI> the <HI>Echinus</HI> and the <HI>Gizzard.</HI>
A Man which has a bigger Brain in pro∣portion
to his Body than any other <HI>Ani∣mal,</HI>
has a better and more easily manage∣able
Hand; whereas a <HI>Monkie</HI> that has lit∣tle
Brains, and consequently can have no
great Use for much dexterity, has not so
well a shap'd nor easily applicable a Hand.
These, and a thousand such Instances of
<HI>Wisdom, Counsel,</HI> and <HI>Metiority</HI> in the
Contrivance and Fabrick of the several
<HI>Animals,</HI> may be gathered by any one
who will consult the Writings of natu∣ral
Historians. But those who will not
be convinc'd by the Instances I have brought
that there is a God who rules <HI>in the King∣doms
of the Earth,</HI> who number'd all our
parts, and appointed them out their se∣veral
Ends and Uses I am afraid will
not be prevail'd upon by those behind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nature of Finiteness and
Infiniteness, and the Limits of
Human Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. IT is beyond all Dispute, that
our Minds and Capacities, are
as really bounded and circum∣scrib'd,
as our Bodies; and that it is as im∣possible
for us to extend our Intellectual
Faculties, beyond their determin'd Limits,
as it is for us to add a Cubit to our
<HI>Stature;</HI> There are some things, that we
can never by all our Endeavour, attain to
a perfect Comprehension of; in vain we
Labour, in vain we Struggle, the Eyes of
our Understanding are capable of but a
limited <HI>aperture,</HI> and of receiving but a
bounded Object; If we strive to enlarge
it, we perceive nothing, but Darkness and
Confusion: We may sooner be able to
<PB N="2" REF="435"/>
<HI>accommodate</HI> a Line of ten Feet, in a Circle
of a Foot <HI>Diameter,</HI> than be able to con∣ceive,
how some things can be, whose
Existence notwithstanding, we are forced
to allow; and since it is so, it becomes a
Wise Man to distinguish between what
he can really understand, and comprehend,
and where he must be contented to be
ignorant.</P>
<P>§ II. <HI>Magnitude</HI> or <HI>Quantity</HI> in the <HI>Ab∣stract,</HI>
is that of which we have the clear∣est
and justest Apprehensions, as it is evi∣dent
from hence, that almost all Men,
who have apply'd themselves diligently to
discover, in a proper Method, the Proper∣ties
of <HI>Lines, Figures</HI> and <HI>Numbers,</HI> have
agreed in their Conclusions: The Reason
of which is, that the <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Ideas,</HI> of
these things, are both the simplest, least
compounded, and most distinct, and have
the least Influence on our Passions, Preju∣dices
and Interests, which generally give
the <HI>Byass,</HI> to our Reasonings; and yet for
all this, our Minds can never conceive,
<PB N="3" REF="436"/>
nor our Imaginations form an <HI>Idea</HI> of an
unlimited or boundless Quantity. We
may indeed improve either of these <HI>Facul∣ties,</HI>
by Study and Industry so far, as to
be able to reach Heights that may seem
surprising to those that do not apply them∣selves
to such Matters; but still there are
some things, to which we can never at∣tain,
there is a <HI>Non plus ultra,</HI> beyond which
all is <HI>palpable Darkness,</HI> and <HI>profound Ob∣scurity.</HI></P>
<P>§ III. We may call <HI>finite,</HI> that whose
<HI>Bounds</HI> or <HI>Limits</HI> are given; or that which
is bounded on all possible sides; <HI>infinite</HI> that
which is bounded or limited no way; thus
a <HI>finite</HI> right Line is that, both whose Ex∣tremities
are determin'd or given. An <HI>in∣definite</HI>
right Line, that, one of whose Ex∣tremities
is given, but not the other; <HI>i. e.</HI>
a right Line with but one Extremity. An
<HI>infinite</HI> right Line, that which is both ways
<HI>indefinite, i. e.</HI> a Line with no Extremity at
all. Thus an <HI>equilateral Triangle,</HI> or a
<HI>Circle</HI> of a given side or <HI>Radius,</HI> compre∣hends
<PB N="4" REF="437"/>
a given or <HI>finite Area;</HI> but of an <HI>in∣finite</HI>
side or <HI>Radius,</HI> (if one may be al∣low'd
to speak so) an <HI>infinite Area,</HI> as also
an <HI>equilateral Cone,</HI> or <HI>Sphere,</HI> of a given
side or <HI>Radius,</HI> makes a <HI>finite</HI> Solid; but of
an <HI>infinite</HI> side or <HI>Radius,</HI> an <HI>infinite</HI> Solid.
But because <HI>Infiniteness</HI> is of that Nature, that
it neither can be defin'd by us, from its <HI>po∣sitive</HI>
Properties, nor apprehended, by its
<HI>essential</HI> Attributes, we are forced to de∣scribe
it, by telling what it is not, rather
than what it is. And seeing before we can
speak any thing distinctly about the Na∣ture
of <HI>Finiteness</HI> or <HI>Infiniteness,</HI> we must have
some Mark or Rule, to distinguish the one
from the other, there is none, I think, more
certain, than this, that <HI>infinite</HI> is always
greater than any <HI>finite</HI> Quantity, how great
soever; for whatever Quantity always ex∣ceeds,
all possible Degrees of <HI>Finites,</HI> how
great soever, must be <HI>Infinite,</HI> since we can
have no Notion of any real Quantity but
<HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Infinite</HI> with the Degrees there∣of.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="438"/>
§ IV. There are two Kinds of <HI>In∣finits,</HI>
or <HI>infinitely</HI> great Quantities; one <HI>Re∣lative,</HI>
which is only <HI>Infinite,</HI> in respect of
another Quantity, infinitely Less: and of
these there are Gradations <HI>in infinitum,</HI> each
of which, tho' infinitely Little, in them∣selves,
is yet infinitely Great, in respect of
those infinitely Less. Thus any right
lin'd <HI>Angle,</HI> is <HI>infinite</HI> in respect of the cir∣cular
Angle of <HI>Contact;</HI> And there are o∣ther
<HI>Curves in infinitum,</HI> whose <HI>Angles</HI> of
<HI>Contact</HI> are <HI>infinitely</HI> Less, than circular ones,
as we shall afterwards demonstrate. Thus
in the Motions of the <HI>Planets,</HI> the <HI>Centri∣petal</HI>
Force, in <HI>infinitely small Portions</HI> of their
<HI>Orbits,</HI> is infinitely Little, in respect of the
<HI>projectile</HI> Force, or this is infinitely Great,
in respect of that. The other <HI>Absolute,</HI>
which is <HI>infinite,</HI> in respect of any <HI>finite</HI>
Quantity, how great soever: thus the
Space contain'd between the <HI>Asymptote</HI> of
some <HI>Hyperboloids,</HI> and a Line <HI>parallel</HI>
thereto, at a <HI>finite</HI> Distance from it, is <HI>in∣finite</HI>
in respect of the <HI>finite</HI> Space, of an
<PB N="6" REF="439"/>
<HI>infinite</HI> Length, comprehended between the
<HI>Asymptote</HI> and the <HI>Curve.</HI> Thus the <HI>Expan∣sion</HI>
or Space of the Universe, is <HI>infinite,</HI> in
respect of the place of Body. And what
is said of <HI>infinitely</HI> great Quantities, is also
true of <HI>infinitely</HI> Small ones, for if an <HI>in∣finitely</HI>
small Quantity, may be a Relative
<HI>infinitely</HI> Great one, in respect of an <HI>infinitely</HI>
Less. <HI>Infinitely</HI> Small, and <HI>infinitely</HI> Great,
will then become correlatives, and conse∣quently
the same may be <HI>infinitely</HI> Great,
and <HI>infinitely</HI> Small, in respect of other <HI>in∣finitely</HI>
Greater, or Smaller, and therefore
Universally, as <HI>infinitely</HI> Great, is to <HI>finite,</HI>
so is <HI>finite</HI> to an <HI>infinitely</HI> small Part there∣of,
as also, as <HI>finite</HI> to an <HI>infinitely</HI> small
Part thereof, so is that, to an <HI>infinitely</HI> small
Part of this <HI>infinitely</HI> small one.</P>
<P>§ V. <HI>Numbers,</HI> are the most simple
and distinct <HI>Pictures,</HI> or <HI>Representations,</HI> of
<HI>finite</HI> Quantities, and consequently they
would be so likewise of <HI>infinite</HI> ones, if
an <HI>infinite Number</HI> were assignable; But
seeing such a thing, is impossible, we must
<PB N="7" REF="440"/>
consider how any <HI>finite</HI> determin'd <HI>Number,</HI>
is increas'd or diminish'd, and go on in
increasing, or diminishing <HI>in infinitum,</HI> and
thus frame our Notions of <HI>infinitely</HI> great
or <HI>small Numbers;</HI> Thus, if we add <HI>unity</HI>
perpetually to itself, we shall have as great
a <HI>finite Number</HI> as we desire, and if we con∣tinue
thus adding <HI>in infinitum,</HI> we shall at last
have a <HI>Number</HI> greater than any <HI>finite</HI> one,
how great soever; <HI>i. e.</HI> we shall have an <HI>in∣finite
Number,</HI> not actually, because we can
never actually go thro' these <HI>infinite</HI> Additi∣ons;
But Virtually, <HI>i. e.</HI> we shall have the
Progression, or the Representation of the
Nature, of such a <HI>Number,</HI> whose Sum at last
would be equal to an <HI>infinite Number</HI> of Uni∣ties,
or other <HI>finite Numbers.</HI> And because
a constant Addition, so many times, of a
determin'd <HI>Number,</HI> is equivalent to a Mul∣tiplication
of such a <HI>Number,</HI> by such ano∣ther
<HI>Number,</HI> therefore what may be had
by a perpetual Addition, may be more
easily obtained, by some one or more Mul∣tiplications,
join'd together. Likewise,
as by a perpetual Subtraction, from any
<PB N="8" REF="441"/>
<HI>finite Number</HI> how Great soever, of one or
more unites, we shall at last obtain a re∣mainder,
equal to any finite Number, how
small soever, so by such a Subtraction per∣petuated
<HI>in infinitum,</HI> we should obtain a
<HI>Number,</HI> smaller then any <HI>finite Number,</HI> how
small soever, <HI>i. e.</HI> an <HI>infinitely</HI> small <HI>Number.</HI>
And because Division is only a perpetual
Subtraction of such a <HI>Number,</HI> so many times
as the Divisor implies, therefore, whatever
may be obtained in this Case by Subtra∣ction,
may be also had by Division. But
here it is to be observ'd, that the whole
Force of this manner of generating an <HI>infi∣nitely</HI>
great or small <HI>Number,</HI> lies in the <HI>in∣finitely</HI>
perpetuated arithmetical Operations,
upon finite given <HI>Numbers;</HI> not that these
Operations, in any finite time, can actually
compleat or exhibit the <HI>infinite Number</HI> re∣quired.
But that these continued <HI>in infini∣tum,</HI>
would at last exhibit them, if such a
thing were to be obtain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="442"/>
§ VI. That <HI>infiniteness</HI> implies no Con∣tradiction,
in its Import or Signification,
(as some have thought) is evident from
both the ways just now mentioned, of ge∣nerating
an <HI>infinitely</HI> great or small <HI>Number,</HI>
which may represent any <HI>infinitely</HI> great or
small Quantity whatsoever; for whatso∣ever
has once been, implies no Contradi∣ction
it should be again, and if a <HI>finite
Number,</HI> or Quantity may be once added
to itself, it may be again added to itself,
and again, and a third time, and conse∣quently
it implies no Contradiction it
should go on constantly, in being added to
itself, <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and the Sum of all
these, would make a Number greater than
any <HI>finite Number,</HI> how great soever; <HI>i. e.</HI>
an <HI>infinite Number.</HI> Again, if you can mul∣tiply
a <HI>Number</HI> by itself, you may do it a∣gain,
and again, at least it implies no Con∣tradiction,
it should be so multiply'd; and
after an assignable <HI>Number</HI> of such Multi∣plications,
it may be still multiply'd by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tself, or another <HI>Number;</HI> and so it im∣plies
<PB N="10" REF="443"/>
no Contradiction, it should be still
going on in Multiplying; the Product of
all which Multiplications, and the Sum of
all which Products, would make a <HI>Number</HI>
greater then any <HI>finite</HI> one, how great soe∣ver,
<HI>i. e.</HI> an <HI>infinite Number.</HI> Likewise it's
certain that between any two given Terms
an <HI>infinite</HI> Number, of <HI>Geometrical</HI> mean
Proportionals, can imply no Contradiction,
since we can assign their Sum; thus be∣twixt
½ and 0 the Sum of an infinite Num∣ber
of mean <HI>Proportionals,</HI> at the rate of 2
to 1 is equal to Unity; and since the Sum
is assignable, the Parts can imply no Con∣tradiction;
and universally betwixt <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and 0,
there and an infinite Number of mean
<HI>Proportionals,</HI> in the <HI>ratio</HI> of <HI>a</HI> to 1, whose
Sum is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and the mean <HI>Proportionals</HI>
themselves, are <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Besides, the
whole <HI>abstract Geometry,</HI> depends upon the
possibility of <HI>infinitely</HI> great, and small
Quantities, and the Truth's discover'd by
<HI>Methods,</HI> which depend upon these Sup∣positions,
<PB N="11" REF="444"/>
are confirm'd by other <HI>Methods,</HI>
which have other Foundations; and they
are too well supported, to allow of any
Hesitation, in those that are throughly ac∣quainted
with this Science. Instances are
needless, since whoever does understand
these things, need not be told this.</P>
<P>§ VII. But that <HI>Infiniteness,</HI> involves no
Contradiction in its Import or Signification,
is evident from the necessity of allowing
both <HI>Extension</HI> and <HI>Duration</HI> to be bound∣less,
and Quantity to be infinitely Divisi∣ble;
for, 1. That the <HI>Extension,</HI> of the
Universe is boundless, is evident from
hence, that whereever we stop, there must
be still further <HI>Extension;</HI> for every Limit
is the termination of two Distances in the
same right Line, one going forward, the
other backward, from the Limiting Point,
and whereever our Imagination may place
the <HI>Limits</HI> of the <HI>Extension,</HI> of the Universe,
yet a little further Reflection, will convince
us, there must be <HI>Extension</HI> beyond these <HI>Li∣mits,</HI>
for in <HI>Extension,</HI> the end of one Part of
<PB N="12" REF="445"/>
it, is the beginning of another, and so it
must go on without Bounds or Limits.
Moreover, if the <HI>Extension</HI> of the Universe
is <HI>finite</HI> only, then a <HI>Sphere</HI> of a finite <HI>Dia∣meter,</HI>
may be found equal to it, for a <HI>Cube</HI>
of a <HI>finite</HI> side, may be found equal to any
finite Content whatsoever, as is well
known; and the <HI>Radius</HI> of a <HI>Sphere</HI> equal
to this <HI>Cube,</HI> is the Product of the side of
the <HI>Cube</HI> multiply'd, into the <HI>Cube Root</HI> of 3/2
parts of the <HI>ratio</HI> of the <HI>Radius</HI> to the <HI>Circum∣ference.</HI>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Let us then suppose the whole fi∣nite
<HI>Extension</HI> of the Universe, equal to the
<PB N="13" REF="446"/>
<HI>Sphere,</HI> whose <HI>Radius</HI> is <HI>AB,</HI> let this <HI>Sphere</HI>
be cut by a plane through its Center, and
the Section, be the <HI>Circle ADFE;</HI> it's certain
from the <HI>Elements</HI> of <HI>Euclid,</HI> that to any gi∣ven
Point <HI>A,</HI> a <HI>Tangent AC,</HI> may be drawn,
of which only the Point <HI>A</HI> falls upon the
<HI>Circle,</HI> the rest falling without it; from
whence it's evident, that there must be <HI>Ex∣tension</HI>
without this Circle, or the <HI>Sphere</HI> by
the Section of which it is generated; since
a plane passing through this <HI>Tangent,</HI> will
only touch the <HI>Sphere</HI> in the Point <HI>A,</HI> by
which there will an extended Distance re∣main,
between the <HI>Circumference</HI> of the
<HI>Sphere</HI> and the <HI>Tangent</HI> in all their Points ex∣cepting
one, and since this is true, of every
finite <HI>Extension</HI> how great soever, it's evident
the <HI>Extension</HI> of the Universe is greater than
any finite <HI>Extension.</HI> 2. As to <HI>Duration,</HI> it
is evident, that it both has been without a
beginning, and must be without an end,
for whether this Universe had a beginning
or not, yet time or <HI>Duration</HI> must have for
ever been; there is an absolute necessity, of
admitting some real Being to have been for
<PB N="14" REF="447"/>
ever, as I have already demonstrated, in
the preceding Chapters; and consequent∣ly
the <HI>Duration</HI> of this Being, has been for
ever; and since some real thing must for
ever <HI>exist,</HI> therefore the Duration of this
thing must for ever be; so that it's evident,
whatever <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Philosophy</HI> we go upon,
<HI>Duration</HI> must be <HI>infinite</HI> both <HI>à parte ante,
&amp; post,</HI> as the Schools speak. Besides,
were there nothing actually existing, yet
time could not be said not to exist, for
we cannot suppose a time, when time was
not, the very Supposition, destroying it∣self,
wherefore <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Duration,</HI> is, and
must be <HI>infinite.</HI> 3. The infinite <HI>Divisibi∣lity</HI>
of Quantity is so plain, and demon∣strated
from so many different Principles,
that it were needless to dwell upon it, the
most perfect and unavoidable Proof there∣of,
is the common one, from the <HI>incom∣mensurability</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="448"/>
of surd Quantities, let <HI>ABCD</HI>
be a <HI>Square,</HI> whose <HI>Diagonal</HI> is <HI>BD,</HI> then
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
is the side <HI>AD</HI> to the <HI>Diagonal BD,</HI> as 1.
# 2. from whence it's plain, that divi∣ding
the side <HI>AD</HI> into Parts equal, how
small soever <HI>Pp,</HI> yet still <HI>Pp</HI> or <HI>Rm</HI> shall
be to <HI>Mm,</HI> as 1 to # 2. Since the <HI>Tri∣angles
ABD, RMm</HI> are <HI>Similar,</HI> so that
is impossible before an actual infinite Di∣vision
of the side <HI>AD,</HI> to find a Part in
the <HI>Diagonal Mm,</HI> that should have to <HI>Pp,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="449"/>
any such Proportion as either <HI>Integers,</HI> or
<HI>Fractions</HI> have to one another, <HI>i. e.</HI> it is ab∣solutely
impossible before an actual <HI>infinite</HI>
Division, to find a part <HI>Pp</HI> in the side <HI>AD,</HI>
that taken a certain finite, or even infinite
Nunber of times, should equal <HI>DB</HI> exactly,
and consequently if <HI>AD,</HI> were divided in
ever so small Parts, yet <HI>BD</HI> is capable of
being further divided, and that still on, <HI>in
infinitum;</HI> from all which, it's very evident,
that neither <HI>infinitely</HI> Great, nor <HI>infinitely</HI>
Small, involves any Contradiction in their
Import or Signification.</P>
<P>§ VIII. <HI>Finitude</HI> and <HI>infinitude,</HI> involve
nothing in their Import and Conception,
but the Degrees of the Properties of Things;
they do not signifie really Beings, or
Things in themselves, but the <HI>Modes,</HI> and
Measures of the <HI>Affections</HI> of Things; <HI>In∣finiteness</HI>
is an <HI>abstract Term,</HI> signifying the
unboundedness of the Property, or Qua∣lity
of a real Being, but like all other
<HI>Adjuncts,</HI> does not imply a real <HI>Idea,</HI> till
it is joyn'd to some <HI>Substantive;</HI> thus <HI>in∣finite
<PB N="17" REF="450"/>
Knowledge,</HI> or <HI>infinite Wisdom,</HI> unli∣mited
<HI>Extension,</HI> and endless <HI>Duration,</HI> are
intelligible Properties of things, but <HI>Infi∣nity</HI>
is a <HI>vague</HI> and undetermin'd Notion,
till its Import is determin'd by the Addi∣tion
of a proper <HI>Subject;</HI> some Persons
have thought that <HI>Infinitness</HI> was a contra∣dictory
Term, because they could not com∣prehend
its Extent, or paint an Image
thereof upon their Imaginations; others
have thought, that nothing could be capa∣ble
of having <HI>Infinity</HI> ascribed to it, but
immediately it must belong to the first Be∣ing,
and so could not belong to a Crea∣ture,
because whatever was <HI>infinite</HI> in any
one Property, they thought must necessa∣rily
be so in several others, which destroy∣ed
the Nature of a created Being. The
falsity of the first, I have shewn in the two
former <HI>Sections,</HI> and tho' I am of Opinion,
that there is no <HI>Creature,</HI> endowed with
any Quality, infinite in Degree; yet cer∣tain
it is, that there is no absurdity, that
there should be such, since there may be
<HI>infinites</HI> of several Kinds, which may have
<PB N="18" REF="451"/>
no Relation to, nor Dependance upon one
another: Thus a <HI>Line</HI> may be limited at
one Extremity, but unlimited at the o∣ther,
a <HI>Parallelogram</HI> may be of an <HI>infinite</HI>
Length, but of a <HI>finite</HI> Breadth, and a Solid
may have <HI>infinite</HI> Length, and Breadth, but
a <HI>finite</HI> Thickness or Profundity; thus also
the <HI>Extension</HI> of the Universe, or the <HI>mun∣dan
Space,</HI> may be boundless, and yet have
no other real Property; and Time, or <HI>Du∣ration,</HI>
may be <HI>eternal,</HI> and have neither
Knowledge, nor Wisdom; some Proper∣ties
involve some others necessarily, as So∣lidity
does Impenetrability, some do not at
all imply others, as <HI>Extension</HI> does no way
imply Thought, nor Motion, Knowledge;
and when a finite Degree of any one Pro∣perty,
implies a finite Degree of another,
the <HI>infinite</HI> implies the <HI>infinite;</HI> but when
a <HI>finite</HI> Degree of any one Property, does
not at all imply any Degree of another,
the <HI>infinite</HI> Degree of that Property, does
not at all alter the former Case, nor im∣ply
any Degree of that other, either <HI>finite</HI>
or <HI>infinite:</HI> Wherefore there is no Impossi∣bility,
<PB N="19" REF="452"/>
or Absurdity, that a created Being
should be endowed with some Qualities
<HI>infinite</HI> in their Degree, provided these do
not imply others which destroy the Essence
of a Creature; And this Universe may be
a created Being, and yet be <HI>infinite</HI> in its
<HI>Extension,</HI> since <HI>Extension</HI> implies neither
Knowledge nor Reflexion, nor any of the
Properties of spiritual Beings; As also this
World may have been from all <HI>Eternity,</HI> and
yet have been created, for eternal Dura∣tion
implies no other positive Quality, un∣less
we suppose it to have been from all
<HI>Eternity of it self,</HI> which quite alters the
Case; for the necessary Existence of a thing
from <HI>it self,</HI> implies many other Qualities,
as I have shewn in the last <HI>Article</HI> of the
<HI>second Chapter;</HI> but in effect, <HI>Time</HI> and
<HI>Space,</HI> are no real things, nor compleat Sub∣sistences,
they are only the <HI>Modes</HI> and <HI>Cir∣cumstances</HI>
of other things. I do not here de∣temine,
whether <HI>infinite Extension,</HI> and <HI>eternal
Duration,</HI> may be the <HI>Immensity</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI>
of that first great Being, which is endow'd
with all other suitable Qualities, tho' per∣haps,
<PB N="20" REF="453"/>
there may be abundance of Reason to
lead one to think so; all I maintain, is, that
there is no Absurdity in admitting Creatures
to be endow'd with some Qualities, <HI>infinite</HI>
in their Degrees, which do not necessarily in∣volve
those others, that destroy the Being of
a Creature.</P>
<P>§ IX. <HI>Finites</HI> and <HI>Infinites</HI> are <HI>Disparata,</HI>
or things of a quite different Nature, like
<HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Sound, Colours</HI> and <HI>Musick, Extension</HI>
and <HI>Thought,</HI> they have few or no common
Qualities, and very many quite contrary
ones; <HI>finite</HI> is bounded, <HI>infinite</HI> boundless,
<HI>finite</HI> conceivable, <HI>infinite</HI> incomprehensible,
<HI>finite</HI> exhaustible, <HI>infinite</HI> inexhaustible, no <HI>fi∣nite</HI>
Addition nor Multiplication of <HI>finites,</HI> can
produce an <HI>infinite,</HI> nor has <HI>finite</HI> to <HI>infinite</HI> any
assignable Proportion, for these only have a
Proportion to one another, which by finite
Multiplications, can mutually exceed one a∣nother;
from whence it is evident, that <HI>finite</HI>
is no part of <HI>infinite,</HI> and that <HI>finite</HI> can nei∣ther
be added to, nor substracted from <HI>infi∣nite,</HI>
for only these things that are of the same
kind are capable of Addition, or Subtra∣ction,
<PB N="21" REF="454"/>
you cannot add <HI>Cows</HI> to <HI>Horses,</HI>
because no Number, nor part of the one,
can make the other, so likewise you can∣not
add <HI>finites</HI> to, nor subtract 'em from
<HI>infinites,</HI> because no <HI>finite</HI> Number of <HI>finites,</HI>
can make an <HI>infinite,</HI> nor any <HI>finite</HI> part of
an <HI>infinite</HI> make a <HI>finite,</HI> wherefore in the
<HI>Arithmetick</HI> of the one, the other is to be ne∣glected,
as no parts of the <HI>Quaesitum;</HI> so like∣wise
in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of <HI>finites,</HI> all <HI>infinites</HI>
are to be thrown away, as no parts of the
thing we search for. The same is true, of
any <HI>infinitely</HI> great or little Quantity, of a
higher Rank, in respect of those of a lower,
for when the Proportion between any kinds
of <HI>infinites,</HI> (either <HI>infinitely</HI> Great or <HI>infi∣nitely</HI>
Small) is the same, as that between
an <HI>infinite</HI> of the lowest kind and a <HI>finite,</HI>
then in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of such <HI>infinites,</HI> the
lower is to be rejected, in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of
the higher kind; thus the square Root, of
an <HI>infinite</HI> Quantity, is to be thrown away,
in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of the Squares of <HI>infinite</HI>
Quantities; and the Squares, in that of the
<HI>Cubes,</HI> and so in the higer Powers. But
<PB N="22" REF="455"/>
in <HI>infinitely</HI> small Quantities, the contrary
obtains, by reason that the Product of the
Multiplication of two Fractions, is always
less than either of the Factors. But where∣ever
the Proportion of <HI>finite</HI> to <HI>infinite</HI> ob∣tains,
the last is always to be rejected in
the <HI>Arithmetical</HI> Operations of the first, be∣cause
no <HI>finite</HI> Multiplication of the latter,
can produce the former, and therefore this
is no Part of that, I mean in <HI>Arithmetical</HI>
Operations, of Addition and Subtraction
of these Quantities.</P>
<P>§ X. The positive Nature of <HI>Infinites,</HI>
is absolutely incomprehensible, by <HI>finite</HI> Ca∣pacities,
such as ours are; both our Ima∣ginations
and Apprehensions are <HI>finite,</HI> so
we can neither frame a Picture to ourselves,
nor form a Notion of <HI>Infinity;</HI> our Me∣mories
and our discursive Faculties, are li∣mited,
so we can neither exhaust the Con∣tents,
nor run over the Parts of <HI>Infinites,</HI>
in a word, by none of the <HI>Faculties,</HI> nor
any of the <HI>Operations</HI> of the Mind, can we
attain to the positive Properties, or essen∣tial
<PB N="23" REF="456"/>
Attributes of <HI>Infinites.</HI> We see for Ex∣emple
in Numbers (the most adequate
Pictures of all finite Quantities) that a di∣stinct
Apprehension, of their positive Qua∣lities,
of their Nature, and Relations, is
the last thing we attain to, when we are
Children, as our Minds enlarge, and our
Understandings open, we are capable to
advance, and if our Capacities did con∣stantly
enlarge and encrease, we might per∣haps,
come distinctly to conceive the
greatest <HI>finite</HI> Numbers, with as much Fa∣cility
as we now do the least, and if our
<HI>Comprehensions,</HI> came at last to be <HI>infinite,</HI>
we then should conceive, the positive Na∣ture
of <HI>infinite</HI> Quantities, as easily, as we
do now <HI>finite</HI> ones; but we know very well
that the natural Enlargement of our Minds,
and Capacities, ends commonly, at the
time of our Maturity; and that all that
Study and Application does, is to give us a
Facility, in conceiving things, and furni∣shes
us with variety of Objects; but adds
little Vigor, or Force, to the natural <HI>E∣nergy,</HI>
of our Minds, so that they are very
<PB N="24" REF="457"/>
far from arriving to that Strength, so as to
be able to conceive, the positive Nature of
<HI>Infinites.</HI> Since then thus it is, since it is
absolutely impossible for us to stretch our
Capacities, beyond their prescrib'd Limits,
since we can never comprehend the <HI>positive</HI>
Nature of <HI>Infinites,</HI> we must be contented,
to improve that Part of <HI>infinites,</HI> which we
can attain to, with any probability of Suc∣cess,
and that is their <HI>relative</HI> Nature, or the
finite Relations of <HI>infinites</HI> to one another,
for it's certain, that <HI>infinites</HI> have to one a∣nother,
all the Proportions that <HI>finites</HI> have,
for an <HI>infinite</HI> Quantity of equal Parts, such
as <HI>n,</HI> has to an infinite Quantity of equal
Parts such as Unity, the Proportion that <HI>n</HI>
has to <HI>i.</HI></P>
<P>§ XI. For the more distinct Appre∣hending,
the relations of <HI>Infinites</HI> to one ano∣ther,
it is necessary we should distinguish
the Parts, an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of which, con∣stitutes
the <HI>infinite.</HI> Now these may be ei∣ther
all unequal, and that in a regular Pro∣gression,
such as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<PB N="25" REF="458"/>
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum,</HI> where the Parts that at last
constitute, the <HI>infinite,</HI> are as Natural Num∣bers;
or these Parts may be as the <HI>Squares,
Cubes,</HI> or any other Powers of Natural
Numbers, or as the Roots of such Powers;
or they may go on in any <HI>Geometrical</HI> Pro∣gression
ascending or descending from <HI>in∣finite,</HI>
or the Parts may have no regular
Progression: all these Varieties may happen
in the Parts, of which, an <HI>infinite</HI> Number,
constitutes the <HI>infinite.</HI> Or lastly, the Parts,
of which the <HI>infinite</HI> Number, at last con∣stitutes
or represents the <HI>infinite,</HI> may be e∣qual,
as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>in infini∣tum,</HI>
or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>in infinitum;</HI>
for Distinction sake, let ∞ represent or sig∣nify
an infinite Number of Unities or <HI>In∣finite</HI>
in general, (for so I would be under∣stood

small Parts, this I here declare once

are <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> an <HI>infinite</HI> Num∣er

of an infinity of Unities, which is

<P>From this <HI>Article</HI> and the <HI>Ninth,</HI> the
whole <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of <HI>Infinites</HI> with one ano∣ther,
and of <HI>Finites</HI> with <HI>Infinites,</HI> may be
deduced; having first reduc'd all <HI>Infinites</HI>
to those, whose infinitely small Parts are e∣qual:

<P>Those who are ever so little acquainted

Understand the Truth and Reason of these
Operations.</P>
<P>§ XII. Now to illustrate this <HI>Arithme∣tick,</HI>
in some few Problems; let the first be
in that of the Sum of an <HI>arithmetical Progres∣sion,</HI>
equal to <HI>y,</HI> from having the first Term
<PB N="29" REF="462"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> the last <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and the Common Dif∣ference,
equal to <HI>e,</HI> given. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> signify,
the Difference of two Quantities when it
is uncertain which is greatest, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.</P>
<P>If <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or an <HI>infinite Number</HI> of U∣nities,
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
(by the Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. And the
infinitely small equal Part of such a Sum,
or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; the same hap∣pens
if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> for Exemple,
the Sum of a <HI>Series,</HI> of natural Numbers,
whose first Term is 0, and the last is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>infinitum,</HI> is e∣qual
to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. or all the natural Numbers, be∣ginning
at 0, and stoping at <HI>infinite</HI> (if I
may be allow'd to speak so) <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>infinitum</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> &amp; c. <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (by the Rules of
<PB N="30" REF="463"/>
<HI>Multiplication,</HI>) or the <HI>infinitely</HI> small equal
part of such a Sum, is equal to an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of halves.</P>
<P>If instead of the common Difference,
the Number of Terms <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> had been given,
then had <HI>y,</HI> been equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. where if
<HI>a</HI> be put equal to a finite Quantity, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (by the
Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and the <HI>infinitely</HI>
small equal part of such a Sum, or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; for Example, if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> then or the Sum of all
the possible <HI>Arithmetical</HI> mean Proportio∣nals,
between 12 and 0, is equal to an <HI>infi∣nite</HI>
Number of Five's, or Five is the <HI>infinitely</HI>
small equal part of such a Sum of <HI>Arithme∣tical</HI>
mean Proportionals.</P>
<P>Suppose <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; thus if <HI>infinites</HI> might be
suppos'd, in an <HI>Arithmetical</HI> Progression, we
should have their Sum; for Exemple, if
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<PB N="31" REF="464"/>
(by the Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and the
<HI>infinitely</HI> small equal Part of such a Sum,
or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.</P>
<P>§ XIII. In a <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression
continued, let the first Term be call'd <HI>a,</HI>
the last <HI>v,</HI> the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms <HI>r</HI> to <HI>s,</HI>
and their Sum <HI>y,</HI> then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> where
if the first Term be ∞, the last 0, <HI>y</HI> be∣comes
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, for Example, let <HI>r</HI> to <HI>s</HI> be as 2
to 1, then a <HI>Geometrical Series</HI> continued, be∣ginning
at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and ending at 0, and go∣ing
on at such a <HI>rate, viz.</HI> the <HI>Series</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum, usque ad</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. or the <HI>infinitely</HI> small equal
part of such a Progression is 2.</P>
<P>And universally, if it be required to find
the infinitely small equal part of such Pro∣gressions,
let that part be called <HI>x</HI> the
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and consequently <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
(by the Rules of <HI>Divisions</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. If <HI>r</HI>
to <HI>s</HI> be as 2 to 1, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. If
<PB N="32" REF="465"/>
<HI>r</HI> to <HI>s</HI> be as 3/2 to 1, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and so in
other Cases.</P>
<P>If the first Term of the <HI>Series,</HI> and of the
<HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms be the same; <HI>viz.</HI> if
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and consequent∣ly
if the first be finite, and the last nothing,
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, as also if the first be nothing, and
the last finite <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.</P>
<P>If the first be finite, and the last nothing,
and it be required, to find the <HI>infinitely</HI>
small equal part of the Sum of such a Pro∣gression,
then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and consequent∣ly
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (by the Rules of <HI>Division</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
for Exemple, if the first Term of the <HI>Se∣ries,</HI>
and of the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms, be 1,
and <HI>r</HI> to <HI>s,</HI> as 1 to ½ then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
<HI>i. e.</HI> an <HI>infinite</HI> Number, of such small
equal parts is equivalent to 2.</P>
<P>If it be required, to find the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the
Terms of a <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression, continu∣ally
descending, whose first Term being a
given Quantity, may have its Sum at last,
<PB N="33" REF="466"/>
equal to the Sum of another Progression,
begining at a different given Quantity,
and going on in a different <HI>Ratio,</HI> suppose
the first Term of such a Progression <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, the
<HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms, <HI>a</HI> to 1, then in that
Case, both their Sums must at last be e∣qual,
<HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and consequently
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; for Exemple, if <HI>r</HI> to <HI>s,</HI> be
supposed, as 1 to ½ then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
and therefore the <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression,
continually descending, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum,</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
because both their Sums are at last equal
to 2. And thus an <HI>Infinite</HI> Number of
different <HI>Series's</HI> may be found, begining
at different Quantities, and going on in
different <HI>Ratio's,</HI> whose Sums, may be at
last all equal; for if you put, a Quantity
less than the Sum, for the first Term of the
<HI>Series,</HI> and of the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms, and
put the second Term of the <HI>Ratio</HI> unknown,
and then collecting the Sum of such a Pro∣gression,
<PB N="34" REF="467"/>
make it equal to the Quantity given,
to which all their Sums should be equal; you
will find the unknown Term of the <HI>Series</HI>
sought; for Exemple, if it were requir'd
to find a <HI>Series</HI> begining at ½ and having
its <HI>Ratio</HI> ⅓ to <HI>s.</HI> which <HI>Series</HI> should be equal,
to the Sum of either of the two preceding
Progressions, which were equal to 2. then
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (in this Case) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
and consequently <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. wherefore,
the first Term of the <HI>Series,</HI> and of the <HI>Ratio,</HI>
being ⅓ and the second Term of the <HI>Ra∣tio</HI>
5/18, the <HI>Series</HI> it self is, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c.
<HI>in infinitum.</HI> = 2. for <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
so that now, to find
an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of such <HI>Geometrical</HI>
Progressions, begining at different Quan∣tities,
and going on in different <HI>Ratio</HI>'s,
we have no more to do, but to form an
improper Fraction (as it's call'd) whose
<HI>Numerator</HI> being any Number such, that
its Denominator, consisting of two Terms,
<PB N="35" REF="468"/>
or Numbers, join'd by the Sign <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, its
Value may be equal to 2; for then per∣forming
the <HI>Division,</HI> according to the
<HI>Arithmetick</HI> of <HI>Cossick</HI> Quantities, we shall
have the <HI>Series's</HI> sought; thus, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
The
Reason why all these <HI>Serie's</HI> consisting of
Terms so different are at last all equal
to one another, shall be afterwards
shewn.</P>
<P>§ XIV. Suppose the last Term of a,
continued <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression <HI>infinite,</HI>
the first finite, then <HI>x</HI> or the <HI>infinitely</HI> small
equal part of the Sum of such a Progres∣sion,
shall be (by the Method used in the
preceding Article) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. for Exemple, Let
the first Term be <HI>i,</HI> the last ∞, the <HI>Ratio</HI> of
the Terms 1 to 3. the <HI>infinitely</HI> equal small
part, of the Sum of the Progression shall
be 3/2: Or this Progression reduc'd to its
equivalent, in equal parts shall be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum.</HI> Again, let the
<PB N="36" REF="469"/>
first Term be <HI>i,</HI> the the last ∞, the <HI>Ratio</HI>
of the Terms 1, to 3/2, the <HI>infinitely</HI> small
equal part, of the Sum of such a Progression,
shall be 3. or the Progression it self, shall
be equal to an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of three's
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> &amp;c. <HI>in infinitum.</HI> And
thus we may reduce any <HI>Geometrical</HI> Pro∣gression
ascending, begining at a finite
Quantity, and ending at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, to an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of equal parts.</P>
<P>If it be desir'd to find a <HI>Geometrical</HI> Pro∣gression,
which begining at Unity, and
having the first Term of its <HI>Ratio</HI> Unity
also, may have its Sum equal to an <HI>in∣finite</HI>
Number of any given equal parts,
such as <HI>a,</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>

means, you may have an <HI>infinite Multiple</HI> or
<HI>Submultiple,</HI> to any other <HI>infinite,</HI> going on
in any assignable Progression, begining at
Unity, and having the first Term of its
<HI>Ratio</HI> Unity, and the last Term of the <HI>Se∣ries</HI>
infinite; thus if to the Progression, be∣gining
at 1, and ending at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and going
<PB N="37" REF="470"/>
on in the <HI>Ratio</HI> of 1 to 2. <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> &amp;c.
<HI>in infinitum</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. you
would have a Progression, whose Sum
should be triple of this, you will find it
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>in infinitum</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
If you would have a <HI>Series,</HI> whose Sum
should be equal to an infinite Number of
Unities, then is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. so
that no such <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression, con∣sisting
of an infinite Number of finite
Terms can, possibly be obtain'd.</P>
<P>And <HI>universally,</HI> you may find a <HI>Geome∣trical
Series</HI> begining at any given Quan∣tity,
less than the second Term of the <HI>Ratio,</HI>
and having the first Term of the <HI>Ratio,</HI> e∣qual
to the first Term of the <HI>Series,</HI> I say,
you may thus find such a <HI>Series,</HI> having
its Sum in any given proportion to any o∣ther
<HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression assigned; and
consequently you may find an infinity of
<HI>Geometrical Series's,</HI> begining at different
finite Quantities, and having different <HI>Ra∣tio's</HI>
all equal to one another. Let <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
<PB N="38" REF="471"/>
so that supposing one of the Terms of the
<HI>Ratio</HI> assum'd at pleasure, you may find
the other; and making the first Term of
the <HI>Series</HI> begin with the first Term of the
<HI>Ratio,</HI> you may have infinitely different
<HI>Geometrical</HI> Progressions, all whose Sums
may be equal.

as also <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> that <HI>Area</HI> becomes <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum,</HI> so
that it is evident, that the space adjacent,
<PB N="40" REF="473"/>
to both the <HI>Asymptotes</HI> of the <HI>Appollonian

on both <HI>Asymptotes</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.</P>
<P>If <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. the <HI>Area ABCDLK,</HI> becomes

<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>

whose first Term is 1, and if it be

<HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms is 1 to 2. its <HI>infinite∣ly</HI>
small equal part, by the <HI>preceding Arti∣cle,</HI>
will be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and so the
interminated Space, contain'd between the
<HI>Curve</HI> and its <HI>Asymptote,</HI> in this <HI>Hyperboloid,</HI>
would be equal to an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of
two's, or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. as also this Space would
be double of the <HI>Appollonian Hyperbolick</HI>
Space. And likewise, because when
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, the Space <HI>BEFH</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<PB N="41" REF="474"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whose first Term is 1,
and last 0, and the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms 1
to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, or 2 to 1, therefore by the <HI>preceding
Article,</HI> the Sum of the Terms is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
So that the whole <HI>Asymptotical</HI> Space of
the <HI>Hyperbola</HI> whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
would be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, upon sup∣position
that the greatest Term of its un∣equal

when the last Term is only ∞ 1. and if
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <HI>y</HI> = 1, the <HI>Area ABEFH</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the
whole <HI>Asymptotick</HI> Space of this <HI>Hyperboloid,</HI>
is equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
upon that Supposition. And Universally,
if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then the Space <HI>AIEDC</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whose infi∣nitely
small equal part (supposing the last
Term of the <HI>Series</HI> only <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.) by the <HI>pre∣ceding
<PB N="42" REF="475"/>
Section,</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and consequently
this <HI>Series</HI> is equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c</HI> and if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then the
Space <HI>ABEFH</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Sum of which is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. so that the
whole Space, comprehended between these
<HI>Curves, in infinitum,</HI> and both <HI>Asymptotes,</HI> of
such exterior <HI>Hyperboloids,</HI> (putting <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>)
is equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
upon such a Supposi∣tion.
Hence it appears in some part, what
those <HI>Geometers</HI> meant by the <HI>Area's</HI> of these
<HI>Hyperboloids,</HI> which in their Language were
call'd <HI>plusquam infinitae,</HI> or more than <HI>infinite,</HI>
which might be, that some of these <HI>Hyper∣bolick</HI>
Spaces, had the equal parts of which
they consisted, in certain <HI>Ratio's</HI> to one a∣nother,
when the last Term of the <HI>Series</HI>
was only <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; thus the <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>Appollonian
Hyperbola,</HI> consists of an <HI>infinite</HI> Number
of Unities, the <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> whose
<HI>Equation,</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, of an <HI>infinite</HI> Num∣ber
<PB N="43" REF="476"/>
of two's; the <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>Hyperbola,</HI>
whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <HI>yx</HI><SUP>3</SUP> = 1 of an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of 3/2's; but here the <HI>infinite</HI> Num∣ber
of equal parts, of which the <HI>Area</HI> of this
<HI>Curve</HI> consists, must be much greater than
the <HI>infinite</HI> Number of equal parts, of which
the former two consists, to exhaust the
whole <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>Asymptotick</HI> Space, for the
whole Space in this, is greater than the
whole in either of the other two, as every
Body knows; so that though the Parts be
less, the Sum must be more, as shall be
afterwards shewn.</P>
<P>If it be required, to find the <HI>Equation</HI> of
a <HI>Hyperboloid,</HI> that shall with the <HI>Asymptote
ABCDEI.</HI> Supposing the last Term
only <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, let the Expression of the given
<HI>Hyperbola,</HI> which contains with the <HI>A∣symptote,
ABC,</HI> the given <HI>infinite</HI> Space,
be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. Let the <HI>Multiple</HI> or <HI>Sub∣multiple</HI>
required, be <HI>a,</HI> then it's plain that
<HI>n/n−1</HI> must be equal to <HI>a,</HI> and consequently
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> for Example, let the given <HI>E∣quation</HI>
be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and consequently the
<PB N="44" REF="477"/>
given <HI>infinite</HI> Space <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and let it be required to find another
<HI>infinite</HI> Space, whose equal parts may be
triple of this, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
and so the <HI>Equation</HI> will be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and
a part of the <HI>infinite</HI> Space it self <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>Now, because, some of these Inferences,
may appear a little odd, and perhaps false,
to some People, to save the trouble of <HI>Ani∣madversions</HI>
(if it be possible) I shall here
obviate some Objections, that might be
made against them; and 1. If it be object∣ed,
that of an <HI>Arithmetical,</HI> or <HI>Geometrical</HI>
Progression, ascending, or descending, <HI>in
infinitum</HI> to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or 0. it is impossible, the
Sums should be equal, to an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of equal parts, for since all the
parts are suppos'd to be unequal, the
Sums cannot be equal; the same Objection
takes place in <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progressions, a∣scending
or descending to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or 0; whose
Terms have different <HI>Ratio's,</HI> and which
begin at different given Quantities, and yet
<PB N="45" REF="478"/>
their Sums are suppos'd equal, or in a given
<HI>Ratio</HI> to one another; for Exemple, how
the <HI>Series</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. should be equal to
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued till
the Number of the Terms become equal to
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. How <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. should be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued till the Num∣ber
of Terms be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. How the
Sum of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to
∞ 1, should be but the third part of the Sum
of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
Since all the parts of the first two <HI>Equations</HI>
are unequal, and the parts of the third,
have no such Proportion, as their Sums are
suppos'd to have. In Answer to these, let
us Consider, 1. that there an <HI>infinite</HI> Num∣ber
of <HI>Series's,</HI> whose Sums may actually
<HI>infinite,</HI> below an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of Uni∣ties,
as well as above it; for Exemple, as
above an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of Unities, there
is an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of two's, of three's, of
<PB N="46" REF="479"/>
fours, <HI>&amp;c. in infinitum;</HI> so below an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of Unities, there are an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of halv's, of one thirds of one
fourths, <HI>&amp;c in infinitum,</HI> all whose Sums,
are actually <HI>Infinite, viz.</HI> as above <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so forth; so below <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> there
is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so on, all which
are real <HI>infinite</HI> Quantities; for an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number, of finite Quantities whatsoever,
makes an <HI>infinite</HI> Quantity; and therefore
the Sum of an <HI>infinite Series,</HI> may be equal
to the Sum of another <HI>infinite Series;</HI> tho'
their parts be all unequal, and both have
an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of parts, because, tho'
the Number of parts in both, be <HI>infinite,</HI>
yet they may be different <HI>infinits,</HI> the one a
Greater, the other a Less; thus for Exem∣ple,
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> conti∣nued
to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. may be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued till all the Number of
parts, be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. because the first <HI>Se∣ries</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="480"/>
encreases fast, and always doubles the
preceding Term, and so quickly arrives at
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. whereas the second goes on at the
same equable Rate, so that there is not so
great a Number of Terms in the first <HI>Series,</HI>
as in the second; for let the Number of
Terms of a <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression continu∣ed,
be, <HI>t</HI> the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Terms <HI>r,</HI> the
greatest <HI>v,</HI> and the least <HI>a,</HI> then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. in this Case, where <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. <HI>t,</HI> becomes <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. Now it
is certain that the Logarithm of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, is only,
not <HI>infinitely</HI> less, than <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; therefore the
Number of Terms, in the first <HI>Series,</HI> is con∣siderably
less, than the Number of Terms
in the second <HI>Series.</HI> But 3. more particu∣larly,
in the <HI>Arithmetical</HI> Progression of na∣tural
Numbers, begining at <HI>i</HI> and ending
at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, because the Sum of all such is equal
to the half of the Rectangle of the greatest,
into the Sum of the Terms; therefore <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
because both the last, and the Sum of
<PB N="48" REF="481"/>
the Terms is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; then as for the <HI>Geometri∣cal</HI>
Progression Ascending <HI>in infinitum, viz.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>&amp;c. usque ad</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. it is evi∣dent,
every Term here is equal to the Sum
of all the former + 1. and since the last
Term is suppos'd <HI>infinite,</HI> or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, there∣fore
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, is equal to the Sum of all
the foregoing Terms, and therefore the last,
with all the preceding, is equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
(by the Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>)
to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. in like manner in the <HI>Geometrical</HI>
Progression continually ascending, from 1
to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. in the <HI>Ratio</HI> of 1 to 3, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<HI>&amp;c. usque ad</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. because every
Term <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, is double of all the preceding
Terms, and because the last Term is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
therefore the Sum of all the Terms except
the last, is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and consequently the
Sum of the last, and of all the preceding
Terms, is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (by the
Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. where it is obser∣vable,
that the <HI>Series</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. is greater, than <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<PB N="49" REF="482"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> be∣cause
there are more Terms in the
first, than in the second; the second di∣verging
faster, and at a greater Rate than
the first, arrives at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> sooner, <HI>i. e.</HI> after
a fewer Number of Terms than the
first. So likewise, if the <HI>Series</HI> be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then
every Term <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> is triple of all the Sum
of the preceding Terms, and consequently
the Sum of all <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; and universally,
the <HI>Geometrical</HI> Progression begining at 1,
and going on continually to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. in the
<HI>Ratio,</HI> of 1 to <HI>n,</HI> viz. <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Every Term <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> is <HI>n</HI>−1 times, the
Sum of all the preceding, and because
the last is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, therefore the Sum of
all the preceding, is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and
consequently the Sum of the last, and
of all the preceding, is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> (by the Rules of <HI>Addition</HI>) to
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. Lastly, as for the two <HI>Series's</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<PB N="50" REF="483"/>
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is evident that
the Number of Terms in the first, is much
fewer than in the second, for the Number
of Terms as has been shewn, is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
which in the first becomes <HI>Log.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and in the
second <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. both which have the same
Numerators, but the Denominator of the
first is much greater, than that of the se∣cond,
and consequently the Number of
Terms in the first, is much less, than the
Number of Terms in the second.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that the <HI>Hyperbolick
Area AFDCB</HI> (see the following Figure)
is found equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> con∣tinued
till the Number of Terms be infi∣nite,
and (taking <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> to the Inscri∣bed
square) yet the <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>infinitely</HI>
long <HI>Parallelogram AFGB</HI> is no more than
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued <HI>in infinitum,</HI>
from whence it would seem to follow that
the Space <HI>AFDCB,</HI> were equal to the
<HI>Parallelogram AFGB,</HI> which is absurd.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="484"/>
To this it is answered, that tho' each of
these, be equal▪ to an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of
Unities, yet the Spaces are not equal be∣cause
that <HI>infinite</HI> Number, is not the same
in both, and the reason why that <HI>infinite</HI>
Number, is not the same in both, is be∣cause
(tho' both <HI>FC</HI> and <HI>FG</HI> meet at an
<HI>infinite</HI> Distance, with <HI>AB,</HI> yet) <HI>FC</HI> meets
sooner with <HI>AB,</HI> than <HI>FG</HI> with <HI>AB, i. e.</HI>
supposing the Distance between <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI>
(the Concurse of <HI>FD</HI> and <HI>AB</HI>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>a,</HI>
and the Distance between <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> (the
Concurse of <HI>FG</HI> with <HI>AB,</HI> if I may be al∣low'd
to speak so) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>b,</HI> then <HI>b</HI> will
be greater than <HI>a.</HI> And consequently we
shall have <HI>AFDCB</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <HI>AFGB</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, where <HI>d,</HI> is
greater than <HI>c</HI> and therefore <HI>AFGB #
AFDCB.</HI> Not only so, but a <HI>Parallelo∣gram,</HI>
whose Breadth is 1, and whose
Length is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>a,</HI> (or the Distance between
<HI>A</HI> and the Concurse of <HI>FC</HI> with <HI>AB</HI>) is
greater, than the <HI>Hyperbolick Area.</HI> To
make this yet more plain, let <HI>AK</HI> = <HI>GL</HI>

KLy,</HI> and <HI>AI = IE</HI> be 1. Let <HI>n</HI> be an
<HI>integer</HI> Number, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, expresses the

which shews, that the greater you suppose

in respect of the same <HI>Absciss AG;</HI> for
Exemple, of two <HI>Curves</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
(of which the former gives <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
the other <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) that which has <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
(<HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) shall have a longer <HI>Or∣dinate,
GL,</HI> than the former, which has
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and consequently the point <HI>L</HI> in
the first (<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) shall approach nearer
to <HI>AC,</HI> than the point <HI>L</HI> in the second
(<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) when you take <HI>AG</HI> the same
in both; and therefore the greater you
suppose <HI>n,</HI> the longer will it be, before the
<HI>Curve LED</HI> meet with the <HI>Asymptote AC,</HI>
but they all meet with <HI>AC,</HI> at an <HI>infinite</HI>
Distance from <HI>A, viz.</HI> when <HI>GL</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<PB N="53" REF="486"/>
and therefore these <HI>infinite</HI> Distances <HI>AC</HI>
must be different according to the different
Values of of <HI>n;</HI> and consequently of
any two of these <HI>Hyperboloids</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,

whose Concurse with <HI>AC,</HI> we shall de∣note
by <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>b,</HI> I say that <HI>a</HI> is less than <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then <HI>GL</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
in which Case the <HI>Ordinate
GL,</HI> is constantly 1. which is the proper∣ty
of the <HI>Parallelogram ACXGL,</HI> which
shews that all the <HI>Hyperboloids</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
meet with the <HI>Asymptote AC,</HI> before <HI>KL,</HI>
infinitely produc'd, meet with it; as also
because <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, is the <HI>Equation</HI> for the

duly considered will remove all the Diffi∣culties

of the <HI>Hyperbolick</HI> Spaces, in respect of the
infinite <HI>Parallelogram,</HI> for the Unity is the
same in both, only the Number of the
<PB N="54" REF="487"/>
Terms in all of them is different, and in
all of them, less than the Number of
Terms in the <HI>infinite Parallelogram.</HI></P>
<P>It may likewise seem odd, why for Ex∣emple,
the equal parts of which the <HI>Area</HI>
of the <HI>Asymptotical</HI> Space, of the <HI>Hyperbo∣loid,</HI>
whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> consists,
should be <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>in
infinitum,</HI> and yet, the equal parts of which
the <HI>Area's</HI> of the <HI>Asymptotical</HI> Space, of the
others <HI>in infinitum</HI> consist, should be less,
for Exemple, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. (where <HI>n</HI> is an <HI>in∣teger</HI>
Number.) And yet its certain, the
<HI>Area's</HI> of these last are greater than the
<HI>Area</HI> of the first, whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
But the Difficulty will vanish, if we ap∣ply
what has been already said to this Case,
for it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s certain that the Number of Terms
of these last, must be greater than the
Number of Terms in the first, (if we suppose
that these equal parts exhaust the whole <HI>A∣reas's</HI>)
for if the Number of Terms in the
first, whose equal parts are <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>a,</HI> the
<PB N="55" REF="488"/>
Number of Terms in the others, whose
equal parts are <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> where <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, be equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>e,</HI>
then <HI>e</HI> must be greater than <HI>a.</HI> But the
Truth of the Matter is, that the Invention,
or the Ground of the Discovery, of these
equal Parts; in the <HI>Asymptotical Space</HI> of these
<HI>Hyperboloids,</HI> is that they all stop, in their
unequal Progressions, at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. for Exem∣ple,
in the <HI>Series</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c. in infinitum,</HI> which expresses the
<HI>Asymptotical</HI> Spaces <HI>AIEDC,</HI> the Invention
of its <HI>infinitely</HI> small part <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, depends up∣on
the Supposition, that all these <HI>Series's</HI> stop
at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and go no further, whereas to give
the true <HI>Hyperbolick</HI> Spaces, they must be all
suppos'd, to go on, an equal Number of <HI>in∣finite</HI>
Times. Now some of 'em, diverging
faster, than others, (those, <HI>viz.</HI> where <HI>n</HI> is the
greatest Number) arrive at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> sooner, and
so by these means an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of the
equal parts, obtain'd upon this Supposition,
cannot be equal to the <HI>infinite</HI> Number of un∣equal
parts which constitute the <HI>Area;</HI> thus
<PB N="56" REF="489"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is equal to the <HI>A∣rea</HI>
of the <HI>Curve</HI> whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>;
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> equal to
the <HI>Area</HI> of the <HI>Curve</HI> whose <HI>Equation</HI> is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and as the <HI>Area</HI> of this last, is greater
than that of the first, so are the parts respe∣ctively;
but the first reduc'd to equal parts,
is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas the se∣cond
is but <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
parts are less than the former; whereas the
second <HI>Area</HI> is greater than the first; but the
reason of this diversity is, because the se∣cond
<HI>Area</HI> arrives sooner at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, than the
first. And the Denomination of the infi∣nitely
small equal part, is taken from its ar∣riving
at <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, without consideration of the
Quickness or Slowness thereof, so that the
unequal parts, which diverge fastest, have the
least <HI>infinitely</HI> small equal parts, tho' in the
mean time, they make the greatest <HI>Area;</HI>
when an equal infinite Number of parts are
taken, as they should do. If it were possible
to find the infinitely small equal parts, of the
<HI>Hyperboloidical</HI> Spaces, from the Number of
<PB N="57" REF="490"/>
Terms being given <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> <HI>a,</HI> then
we should infallibly, have the Relation of
these Spaces to one another; but to
me, at least, it seems impossible, with∣out
knowing what the <HI>Logarithm</HI> of an <HI>infi∣nite</HI>
Quantity is, in it's positive Nature, ever
to arrive at a compleat Comprehension,
even of the <HI>Relative</HI> Natures of these <HI>infinite</HI>
Spaces, for these equal parts, which I have
used to represent in some manner their Re∣lations,
do not at all extend to the whole
Spaces, but to an <HI>Absciss,</HI> which is equal in
them all. I know no way, the Relati∣ons,
of these <HI>infinite Asymptotical</HI> Spaces to
one another, can be express'd, but one of
these two, suppose the <HI>Exponent</HI> of the <HI>Ab∣sciss</HI>
of the one be <HI>p,</HI> of the other <HI>n,</HI> then
these Spaces shall be one another, as
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, or as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; both
which Expressions, are equally unintelli∣gible;
but if we desire to find the <HI>Expo∣nent,</HI>
suppose <HI>p,</HI> of the <HI>Curve,</HI> whose Space
shall be in a given <HI>Ratio,</HI> suppose 1 to <HI>m,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="491"/>
to the other; then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and
and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. where if <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. so
that the <HI>Equation</HI> of the <HI>Curve,</HI> which shall
have its <HI>infinite Asymptotical</HI> Space, double
of that whose Expression is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. and the Spaces are (puting
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>) <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Rea∣son
why this last Space is double of the
first, is because the Terms of the lat∣ter
in those remoter, become greater
than the same Terms of the first num∣bred
from the begining, which happens,
after the first Term in both, equally di∣stant
from the begining of the <HI>Series,</HI> be∣comes
equal; and this in these Cases, is
always an assignable Term, for Exemple,
the second Term in the first is 2, in the
second, is 3/2. and the rest of the Terms
ascend respectively in the Powers of these
Numbers, and if the Exponent of the
<PB N="59" REF="492"/>
Power of 2 and 3/2 be required that shall
make them both the same Number then
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and 2 <HI>n Log.</HI> 2 = <HI>n
Log.</HI> 3. and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. which gives the
Term, from the beginning, which renders
both equal, and so on in other Cases, If
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. which shews that no
<HI>Multiple,</HI> or <HI>Submultiple</HI> of the <HI>Asymptotical</HI>
Space of the <HI>Appollonian Hyperbola,</HI> can be
found but it self, so that it must be the first
and lowest <HI>infinite</HI> Space; that as Unity, is
its own Square, Cube, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or its own <HI>Root,</HI>
so the <HI>Asymptotical Space</HI> of the <HI>Appollonian
Hyperbola</HI> is its own <HI>Multiple</HI> and <HI>Sub∣multiple.</HI></P>

<P>§ XVII. Having illustrated the <HI>Arith∣metical</HI>
Operations of <HI>relative Infinites,</HI> in
some few <HI>Problems,</HI> that involve Quantities
<HI>infinitely</HI> Great, let us now apply the same,
to <HI>infinitely</HI> small Quantities, from the fixt
Point <HI>A,</HI> to the <HI>Axe A H,</HI> let the <HI>Curve ABG</HI>
be described, whose <HI>Ordinate CB</HI> being <HI>y</HI>

with the <HI>Radius AD</HI> = <HI>r,</HI> let a <HI>Semicircle

<HI>ABG,</HI> whose <HI>Tangent</HI> to the <HI>Vertex</HI> is

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Let <HI>C,</HI> be the next Point in the <HI>Axe</HI> to
<HI>A,</HI> and so <HI>AC</HI> shall become <HI>infinitly</HI> small,
or equal to the <HI>Fluxion</HI> of the <HI>Absciss</HI> = <HI>x,</HI>
and then the <HI>Equation</HI> of the <HI>Circle,</HI> will be
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and the <HI>Equation</HI> of the
<HI>Curve</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. But if <HI>A</HI> and <HI>C</HI> coincide,
then <HI>I</HI> and <HI>B</HI> must likewise coincide, be∣cause,
the <HI>Circle</HI> is suppos'd to have these

Points at the <HI>Vertex</HI> common with the other
<HI>Curve,</HI> and consequently <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,

if <HI>m</HI> = 1, the <HI>Curve</HI> becomes the <HI>Appollonian

but in this case <HI><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></HI> is <HI>infinitly</HI> small in respect

is to be suppos'd 0, or <HI>infinitly</HI> small, when
<HI>x</HI> is a flowing Quantity. Wherefore the
<HI>Radius AD</HI> is <HI>infinitly</HI> small, or the <HI>Curva∣ture</HI>
of such <HI>Curves ABG,</HI> is <HI>infinitly</HI> great
at the <HI>Vertex,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Curvature</HI> of
the <HI>Circle,</HI> or between the <HI>Tangent AF,</HI> and

<PB N="65" REF="498"/>
Case the <HI>Exponent</HI> of <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> in the first Term of
the Value of <HI>r,</HI> becomes Negative, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> in
the second Term, being suppos'd <HI>infinitly</HI>
small, <HI>r</HI> becomes equal to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>. And
so the <HI>Curvature</HI> of such <HI>Curves,</HI> at their <HI>Ver∣tex,</HI>
is <HI>infinitly</HI> small (for in all such Cases,
the <HI>Curvature</HI> at the <HI>Vertex</HI> is reciprocally
proportional to the <HI>Radius</HI> of the <HI>Circle</HI> which
touches the <HI>Curve</HI> at that <HI>Vertex</HI>) in respect
of the <HI>Curvature</HI> of a <HI>Circle,</HI> and so the <HI>Curve
AB</HI> will fall within the <HI>Circle AI,</HI> or the
<HI>Circle</HI> will cut the <HI>Curve.</HI></P>
<P>Exemples. If <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.

If <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
If <HI>m</HI> = 1/3 then <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>.
Let <HI>m</HI> be any Number,

whose <HI>Equations</HI> are <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
<PB N="66" REF="499"/>
the <HI>Radius</HI>'s of their <HI>Curvatures</HI> at the <HI>Verti∣cal</HI>
Point <HI>A,</HI> will be, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
and if <HI>m</HI> be an <HI>integer,</HI> or a <HI>fraction</HI> the <HI>Ra∣dius</HI>
of the <HI>Curvature</HI> in the first <HI>Curve,</HI> is <HI>in∣finitly</HI>
little, in respect of the <HI>Radius</HI> of the
<HI>Curvature</HI> in the second; for in that Case
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, But <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
is nothing, or <HI>infinitly</HI> small, in respect of
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>viz.</HI> as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> to 1, or 0 to 1. And
therefore the <HI>Curvature</HI> of the first Kind of
<HI>Curves,</HI> is <HI>infinitly</HI> great, in respect of that
of the second. And thus <HI>infinities's</HI> of <HI>Se∣ries's</HI>
of the <HI>Exponents</HI> of such <HI>Curves,</HI> may
be found, of which the <HI>Curvature,</HI> of the
preceding, may be infinitely Greater or
Smaller, than <HI>Curvature</HI> of the immediately
following.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Having thus explain'd, the
Relations of <HI>Infinites</HI> to one another, I shall
only subjoin this General Reflexion upon
the whole Discourse, that <HI>Infinites</HI> of all
Kinds, as to their positive Nature, are e∣qually
<PB N="67" REF="500"/>
above our Comprehension, it is the
same thing as to us, whether they be sim∣ply
<HI>infinite,</HI> or infinitely <HI>infinite,</HI> their essen∣tial
and positive Proprieties are equally be∣yond
our reach, as the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> seem to
our Eyes, as it were, all stuck into the same
<HI>Concave Sphere,</HI> tho' they be at various, if
not infinitely different Distances from us.
And therefore in our Inquiries about the Na∣ture
and Proprieties of things, we ought to
pass over all those in which Infinity is con∣cern'd,
as being without our <HI>Sphere,</HI> and
not belonging to our Province: where Fi∣nity
is only concern'd, there we may la∣bour,
and hope for Success, God Almighty
having given us Capacities, adequate for
such <HI>Reserches;</HI> but where ever <HI>Infinity</HI> in
its <HI>absolute</HI> Nature, and <HI>positive</HI> Qualities, is
involv'd, there we have nothing to do,
but to leave the Matter as we find it; and
this Reflexion may be of use to us, in
quieting our Minds, about the Difficulties
arising in the conception of those things,
where the positive Nature of Infinites, are
necessary to be understood; and such are se∣veral
<PB N="68" REF="501"/>
Subjects, both of Philosophy and
Religion. God Almighty cannot be sup∣pos'd
to work Contradictions, and if we be
Creatures, we must partake of the essential
Natures of such, and by consequence, be
of finite Capacities and Faculties, and so it
is impossible even for him to make us un∣derstand
the positive Nature and Qualities
of <HI>Infinites.</HI> And no wise Man will at∣tempt
what it's impossible he should obtain,
nor be disquieted at what he can never
help.</P>
