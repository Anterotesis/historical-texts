<LG>
<L>AT the sign of the Horse old Spinuext of course,</L>
<L>Each night took his pipe and his pot.</L>
<L>O'er a jorum of nappy, quite pleasant and happy,</L>
<L>Was plac'd the canonical sot;</L>
<L>The evening was dark, when in came the clerk,</L>
<L>With reverence due and submission,</L>
<L>First stroak'd his cravat, then twirl'd round his hat,</L>
<L>And bowing preserr'd his petition.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'm come, sir, says he, to beg, look d'ye see,</L>
<L>Of your rove end worship and glory,</L>
<L>To inter a po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r baby, with as much speed as may be,</L>
<L>And I'll walk with the lanthern befo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you,</L>
<L>The body well bury, but pray where's the hurry,</L>
<L>Why Lord, sir, the corpse it does stay,</L>
<L>You fool hold your peace, since miracles cease,</L>
<L>A corpse Moses can't run away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Moses he smil'd, crying, sir, a small child,</L>
<L>Cannot longer delay your intention,</L>
<L>And I swear by St. Paul, a child that is small,</L>
<L>Can never enlarge its dimensions.</L>
<L>Bring Moses some beer, and bring me some, d'ye hear,</L>
<L>For I hate to be call'd from my liquor,</L>
<L>Come Moses the King, tis a scandalous thing</L>
<L>Such a subject should be but a Vicar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Moses he spoke, sir, tis pust twelve o'clock,</L>
<L>Besides there's a terrible shower,</L>
<L>Why Moses you elf, since the clock has struck twelve,</L>
<L>I'm sure it can never strike more.</L>
<L>Besides, my dear friend, to this lesson attend,</L>
<L>Which to say and to swear I'll be bold,</L>
<L>That the corpse, snow or rain, can't endanger, tis plain,</L>
<L>Tho' perhaps you or <HI>I</HI> may catch cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Moses went on, sir the clock has struck one,</L>
<L>Pray master look up at the hand,</L>
<L>Why it ne'er can strike less, tis a folly to press</L>
<L>A man for to go that can't stand;</L>
<L>At length has and cloak Old Orthodox took,</L>
<L>But first cram'd his jaws with a quid,</L>
<L>Each tipt of his gill, for fear they should chill,</L>
<L>Then stagger'd away side by side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave, the clerk hum'd a stave,</L>
<L>Whilst the surplice was wrapt round the priest,</L>
<L>So droll was the figure of Moses and Vicar,</L>
<L>That the parish still talk of the jest;</L>
<L>Good people let's pray,—put the corps <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other way,</L>
<L>Or perchance I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll all over it stumble,</L>
<L>It is best to take care, tho' the sages delare,</L>
<L>A Mortuum Capuit can't tumble.</L>
<L>Woman that's born of man—that's wrong, the leafs torn,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O man that as born of a woman.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an't continue an hour, but's down like a flower,</L>
<L>You see, Moses, Death spareth no man;</L>
<L>Here Moses do look, what a confounded book,</L>
<L>Sure the letters are ture turn'd upside down,</L>
<L>Such a scandalous print, sure the devil is in't,</L>
<L>That this basket should print for the crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prithee Moses you read, for I can't proceed,</L>
<L>And bury the corpse in my stead,—Amen! Amen!</L>
<L>Why Moses you're wrong, pray hold still your tongue,</L>
<L>You've taken the tail for the head;</L>
<L>O where's thy sting Death? put the corpse in the earth,</L>
<L>For, believe me, tis terrible weather,</L>
<L>So the corpse was interr'd, without praying a word,</L>
<L>And away they both stagger'd together.</L>
