<L>LET beauty with the sun arise,</L>
<L>To Shakespear tribute pay,</L>
<L>With heavenly smiles and sparkling eyes,</L>
<L>Give lustre to the day,</L>

<L>Warwickshire lad,</L>
<L>All be glad,</L>
<L>For the lad of all lads was a warwickshire lad.</L>
<L>Be proud of the charms of your county</L>
<L>Where nature has lavish'd her bounty</L>
<L>Where much she has given and some to be spar'd</L>
<L>For the bard of all bards was a warwickshire bard</L>

<L>Old Ben, Thomas Otway, John Dryden,</L>

Our Shakespear Compar'd is to no man,</L>
<L>No frenchman, no Grecian, nor Roman,</L>
<L>Their swans are all geese to the Avon's sweet swan</L>
<L>And the man of all men, was a warwickshire man,</L>
<L>Warwickshire man,</L>
<L>Avon's swan,</L>
<L>And the man of all men, was a warwickshire man,</L>
<L>As venison is very inviting,</L>
<L>To steal it our bard took delight in,</L>
<L>To make his friends merry he never was lag</L>
<L>And the wag of all wags, is a warwickshire wag</L>
<L>Warwickshire wag,</L>
<L>Ever brag</L>
<L>For the wag of all wags, was a warwickshire wag</L>
<L>There never was seen such a creature</L>
<L>Of all she was worth, he robb'd nature;</L>
<L>He took all her smiles, and he took all her grief.</L>

<HEAD>THE MULBERRY TREE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BEHOLD this fair goblet, 'twas carv'd from the
tree</L>
<L>Which, O my sweet Shakespear, was planted by thee</L>
<L>As a relick I kiss it, and bow to the shrine,</L>
<L>What comes from thy hand must be ever divine!</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree,</L>
<L>Bend to the,</L>
<L>Blest Mulberry,</L>
<L>Matchless was he</L>
<L>Who planted the,</L>
<L>And thou like him immortal be!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
The trees of the forest, so rampant and high,</L>
<L>Who spread round their branches, whose head sweep
the sky,</L>
<L>To curious exotics, whom taste has brought here,</L>
<L>To root out the natives, at prices so dear,</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Oak is held royal, in Britain's great boast,</L>
<L>Preserv'd once our king, and will always our coast,</L>
<L>But of fir we make ships, we have thousands that fight</L>
<L>While one, only one, like our Shakespear can write,</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Venus delight in her gay myrtle bowers,</L>
<L>Pomona in fruit trees, and Flora in flowers;</L>
<L>The garden of Shakespeare all fancies will suit,</L>
<L>With the sweetest of flowers, and fairest of fruit,</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With learning and knowledge the well letter'd Birch,</L>
<L>Supplies law and physick, and grace for the church,</L>
<L>But law and the gospel in Shakespeare we find,</L>
<L>And he gives the best physick for body and mind,</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fame of the patron gives fame to the tree,</L>
<L>From him and his merits this takes its degree;</L>
<L>Let Phebus and Bacchus their glorie resign,</L>
<L>Our tree shall surpass both the Laurel and Vine.</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The genius of Shakespeare out shines the bright day,</L>
<L>More rapture than wine to the heart can convey,</L>
<L>So the tree which he plan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, by making his own,</L>
<L>Has laurel, and bays, and the Vine all in one.</L>
<L>All shall yield to the Mulberry-Tree, &amp;c, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then each take a relick of this hollow tree,</L>
<L>From folly and fashion a charm let it be;</L>

Fill fill to the planter, the cup to the brim,</L>
